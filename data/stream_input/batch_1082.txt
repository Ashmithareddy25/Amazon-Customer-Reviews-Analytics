B0029PFMRU|5.0|This classic childrens book has been a favorite of ours.  It's fun and your little one can learn all the different colors and animals that make up the story.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Some of the songs aren't even remixed. At all. It has its gems though. Go listen to the whole album on Youtube before buying.
1878424505|5.0|This book was recommended by my therapist and exactly what I needed. It speaks to the situation that brought me to it plus others from my past. I wish I would have read this years ago, but then again, I may not have been ready for it. It's an easy read but definitely stretches the mind at the same time.
B0049VGTGA|4.0|As compared to the original, lowly aluminum CD pressing from the mid-eighties, this gold CD is virtually identical. The only difference I hear is that the levels on the gold CD are lower so you have to raise the volume a little bit more but I hear little to nothing to think that any remastering was done. They got my $25 but save your money and pick up the plain old regular CD. I'm \\"one-and-done\\" with AF and will stick exclusively with Mobile Fidelity, a reissue label that actually does enhance the sound of their reissues for the same price. The only thing I can hope for is that this pressing lasts longer due to the substrate used on it. Happy listening. ;)
1416596097|1.0|Having watched the BBC production of \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" and thoroughly loved it (although I certainly did not understand even 95% of it), I thought I'd read some of JLC's books. Unfortunately, \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" was the first to come through at the public library. Wow, what a dud. Tedious. Probably technically brilliant (what do I know of post-cold war espionage?), but am I the only person who found Issa totally unsympathetic? Why would the other characters (Annabel Richter & Tommy Brue) want so much to stick their necks out for this person? I disliked Issa's character more and more as the book labored on, which does not help one's enjoyment of the book.  The \\"falling in love\\" parts were so unbelievable.  I must be missing something.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and was very impressed; great story, great acting, great visuals... It moves pretty quick, so when you watch it a second or third time, you can catch a lot of the subtle things you may have missed in the first viewing.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|i have told people to 'see this movie'.  the box is too much for some.  this movie is the most realistic look at humanity that i've seen in a long time.  anyone that spoils this movie is a jerk. it's a great movie and it must be seen!  you will ask yourself new questions, if that is your nature.<br />five stars durt
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Having been a fan of JG since the beginning, I was a little disappointed in this effort. I realize he wrote most of these songs himself and that is not the case on previous albums, but maybe he should have tried for writing half of the songs and having help for the others so I don't feel like I should have rented this one from the library. Wish I'd have listened to more of it before I bought it. Also on previous albums there have been at least six or seven foreign language songs, this one has only three. Those are his strong point! Not all bad, liked the Portuguese song \\"Voce Existe Em Mim,\\" but be warned, this is going to be different.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Despite a convoluted and tortuous pre-production history and the participation of two of the more oafish bigheads in the business, Ridley and Russell's Robin Hood is a surprisingly impressive and enjoyable medieval epic that manages to find a new string for the old longbow by placing a prequel to the Hooded Man's outlaw days in a relatively accurately drawn Middle Ages with some contemporary relevance. Admittedly it's going to mean a lot more to British and European audiences, but it's hard not to notice that in its unloving royal siblings Richard (a gruff and bluff Danny Huston) and John (an impressive Oscar Isaac) there's more than a little Tony Blair - vain, bankrupting his abandoned country in unnecessary foreign wars and delusionally regarding himself as a pretty straight kind of guy yet quick to punish anyone who tells him the truth - and Gordon Brown - a petty and spiteful ruler who briefly wins over his people with promises he promptly drops as soon as his throne is secure and is woefully inadequate at turning the economy around. The film even uses the infamous political kiss-of-death phrase 'resigning to spend more time with his family' when honest chancellor William Marshall (William Hurt, looking surprisingly like the director) finds himself out of a job.     There are more nods to James Goldman than Errol Flynn here: Eleanor of Aquitaine gets a few bits of Lion in Winterish sniping without the barbed wit (though John's retort \\"Spare me your farmyard memories, mother: they're not real and I don't understand them\\" comes close) while the film begins, like Robin and Marion, with Robin and Little John in the King's bad books for being a bit too honest as the Lionheart loots his way back from the Crusades. There's an even stronger element of Martin Guerre to the tale as well as it finds a plausible explanation for Robin's twin origins as the peasant Robin Longstrides and the dispossessed noble Robin of Locksley, doing a neat job of tying in the origins of theMagna Carta and civil disobedience to the legend in the process.     There's plenty of action too, ending with not one but two big battles, though the grand finale is a bit too Saving Private Robin at times and Cate Blanchet's presence leading a small band of feral children in the climax seems a clumsy contrivance to put her in jeopardy merely so she can be rescued (she's far more convincingly placed heroically centre stage in a raid on her village). Throughout, the money's on the screen, with little apparent CGI - the sets, while not extravagant, have weight to them - and if it could use a few more extreme long shots at times, it makes good use of the British landscape for once. Thankfully Scott doesn't overdo the stylistics or the MTV editing here, settling for good old-fashioned storytelling and even throwing in that long-absent favorite, the burning map montage sequence. As for Crowe, while his accent briefly makes a detour to Newcastle before settling in Barnsley for an initially ill-advised UK chatshow host Michael Parkinson impersonation (so much so you almost expect him to say \\"So, Richard - this Crusades business. Bit of a lark or is there a more serious side to it?\\"), but luckily he grows in stature alongside the character. And satisfyingly, this film is a real journey, not just from France to England but from opportunist to idealist to legend as Robin's progress mirrors that of the character's evolution from the thug of the early ballads to the champion of the oppressed of modern lore.     While it isn't as good or as ambitious as Kingdom of Heaven, this Robin Hood is still surprisingly damn good entertainment. The extended director's cut gives more time to the feral children and adds a brief action scene and a comic scene between Robin and Marion, but generally works as well as the theatrical cut - there are no huge structural changes or additional subplots here as there were in Kingdom of Heaven's director's cut. Decent but not overwhelming extras on the BluRay include 10 deleted scenes with introduction by editor Pietro Scalia, one-hour documentary Rise and Rise Again, 6 TV spots, teaser trailer and full theatrical trailer.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I ordered this movie, thinking it was a horror film. I clicked on wrong icon. When it was delivered, I said- \\"oh no, a 40 year love story- give me a break.\\"<br />I did not watch it till a few days later. Luckily, I had nothing to do. I don't know where it started, but somewhere in the first 20 minutes, I found my eyes becoming misty.<br />This has to be the most beautiful story of all time. I realized on my 3rd rerun of it that the couple do not even hug----never mind kiss.<br />Zhang ziyi has come along way from this film, but I am sorry she no longer has roles such as these. I think she is a fine actress and seen her in almost everything, not realizing it was her. I am a big asian film fan-mostly horror buff. Occasionally, I wander but not too often. The Road Home is an exception.<br />There are three scenes that have me fighting back the tears. I only watch it by myself. For obvious reasons---Enjoy!
B0037KMHRY|2.0|This was my most disappointing CD purchase in a long time.It was also one of my most anticipated soundtracks of the year, or even past few years.It's being advertised as Daft Punk's music, but, even if they actually had the last edit of each track, it's nothing more than a conventional film score with all of the expected twists and turns(and I haven't even seen the movie yet!). I don't even really need to see the movie now, because it was so easy to pick up on the story from the music alone:it doesn't stand on it's own as an album, separate from the movie.<br /><br />I think that their downfall was being tutored by Hans Zimmer(as is hinted in the album credits). Zimmer has a few gems in his past, but he, along with James Newton Howard, create some of the most homogenized, boring back-drop scores today. \\"Dark Knight\\" had great moments, but other than that, just uneventful soundscapes that float, disconnected from the visuals, themeless. If I want Steve Roach, Robert Rich, or Lustmord, I'll buy their stuff.<br /><br />Daft Punk should've stuck to the formula that's garnered them so much acclaim: pounding, hair-raising electronica anthems that rise to the occasion and force you to feel; rather than boring, string-filled, minute-n-a-half-long snippets that build up quickly and fizzle out just as fast. The two Dafty tracks are good, and the whole album should've consisted of stuff like that.<br /><br />Basically, this soundtrack is: Hans Zimmer revamping the original Tron score, with a couple Daft Punk tunes thrown in for good measure. Very ho-hum, meh, etc.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|There is not one song on this album that is not amazing. Mumford & Sons are brilliant lyricists and their music truly speaks to the soul. Love it!
B004132HZS|5.0|One of the best purchases I have made in a long time!  I'll be waiting for season two to come out next year.
B000069KE0|4.0|As I've already indicated in the Chicago Transit Authority cancellation, I'm just getting rid of 2 choices, so that I will have more room in my Wish List. Both albums are favorites of mine, but I believe that there are others I'd rather have. So if you really want to see what Chicago was all about in the beginning, I highly recommend these first two albums.
B00000ITOY|4.0|I purchased this product for my 18 month old son at Christmas.  I can tell that he is just on the developmental cusp of understanding this toy and that while he is interested in it now, he will get more out of it in the future.  It is a quality product and would be durable for even a preschool, I think.  It is smaller than I imagined, and thus I would not give it to a child younger than one because the pieces would be tempting to teeth on, but at least four of the pieces are small.<br /><br />This is not my favorite toy to play with my son because it is not very exciting. I like it, but I wish I would have purchased a different geometric stacker, perhaps one that has the three different shaped towers.  I think that might have been a little more fun.
B000069KGM|4.0|All I did was decide that I had over filled my Wish List, so I removed the least favorable items. There's absolutely nothing more to this. I wanted to make room for albums I might be more interested in purchasing.
B004DCB62M|5.0|this is the best Kindle collection of Sherlock Holmes stories for the price.      It's all here, and it's easy to navigate.  Yes, it does open up to the first page, and when you \\"Go to\\" from the menu, the \\"Table of Contents\\" will be hidden.  (They need to fix that).  However, if you \\"page back\\" a step or two, the entire \\"Table of Contents\\" will be available to you, and you can simply click on any place in the many books you'd like to read.  (Except Chapter One for some reason.--but, luckily, it's Chapter One and you don't have far to go to get there.)      I've found that many of the Kindle books hide their Table of Contents.  I'm still giving it five stars because, once you page back, the active menu is very easy to navigate with a simple click.  Personally, I'm just thrilled I can carry around the whole Sherlock Holmes canon for $2.73.      In case I didn't make it clear, this is the ENTIRE Sherlock Holmes collection, from start to finish.  You can find out how they met and how their legendary friendship progressed--all the mysteries, the novels, everything is here.    And, I should also add, if they fix this problem with the Table of Contents, you may want to get the updated version when and if it arrives.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Watching Season 1 over again, I picked up alot of stuff I missed the first time.  Now the series gets more in-depth.  Watch for all the little pans the camera makes the next time you watch the show.  There are clues to be gotten from that!  Can't wait to get Season 2!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Do not stop here...I liked  the book was unsure whether I wanted to read the next book in the trilogy. Do it! The second book is better.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I bought this for my Godson for Christmas.  It's his favourite movie and now he can watch it all the time.  He knows all the lines and he loves the extras on the DVD.
0553381687|5.0|I'm not your typical \\"fantasy\\" reader, but I picked this book up in the Used Book Store, and am now hooked.  I'm actually on the 3rd book.  I find the plot to be tight and the characters so beyond fascinating and rich.  I think what I really love about the series is that the author is not predictable - it's not good vs. evil with good always winning.  I am kept on my toes and can't help but cheer on some of the evil doers as well as the classic heroes.  He manages to portray them all with likeable characteristics.  I would recommend highly!
1594481717|5.0|I found Daniel Pink's writing style and reporting on the emergence of right brain thinking as a necessity for the economic future of employment in our society to be valuable.  His approach embraces the necessary changes with curiosity and enthusiasm.  I also appreciated his method of first-person experience with the six senses he proposes as needed to succeed in this new economic age.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie is absolutely my four-year-old's favorite movie. Honestly, we only got it for him because he loved the movie Cars and he loved robots so we figured Pixar and robots might be fun. I was a little bit skeptical that it would be interesting enough for a 4-year-old; it seemed more for older kids/adults. We were not prepared for our son's reaction to the movie!     He almost instantly connected with Wall-E and thought Eva was just about as cool as Wall-E did. During his first watching of the movie, he was so enthralled and excited by everything. We tried to explain some of the events and concepts going on to him as the movie played and frankly we were surprised at how much he seemed to understand. Then when Wall-E gets damaged... he got so upset we were going to turn the movie off. But he insisted on watching it through. We were so surprised with the amount of empathy he felt (and showed) for the main characters! I don't think we'd imagined he could feel so strongly, demonstrate those feelings, and try to verbalize them yet. I think we were as much floored (in a good way) with his reaction to the movie as we were with the movie.     He would watch it everyday (multiple times a day even!) if we would let him. With each re-viewing his reactions are still wonderful to watch and be a part of. His emotional connection with the characters still amazes me. We have been able to expand on ideas like recycling and conserving resources though Wall-E's plight. We have been able to introduce him to the idea of space and planets and the Earth being a planet we live on. Of how important friends are and how we should take care of our friends (by being nice, sharing, helping, etc). The idea of needing exercise to stay healthy, Gardening, vegetables, and eating healthy, and so many more concepts that are somehow more tangible to him now because of this movie.     After many repeated viewings, he is still as enthralled with the movie, but he \\"participates\\" so much it is almost anevent to watch him watching the film! He warns Wall-E about dangers (calls the red lights, \\"bad bugs\\"), he sympathizes with Wall-E when Eva goes dormant, he gets excited with Wall-E stowaway space flight, he laughs and jumps around when Wall-E and Eva dance in space, he joins in cheering on the Captain in his struggles with Auto, and is still dismayed when Wall-E is damaged! He assures us (and himself) that Eva will fix him, and then excitedly cheers on Eva as she works to repair him. And well I could probably go on for paragraphs about his reactions and emotions but I think you can get the idea. I can't think of anything in the movie that is really scary (maybe the big trash compactor robots?), but there are some sad parts definitely (though temporary).     For a younger child, I think this movie offers a lot more then just entertainment. From an emotional and social standpoint this has helped make some concepts we were struggling to teach our 4-year-old more tangible, real, and applicable to his everyday life experiences. From a learning POV, it has introduced quite a bit of science to him in a fun way that we can readily expand and elaborate on. Even for older children, I think it could still be a great jumping-off point for the same concepts and ideas I mentioned previously. And for every age it is an enjoyable and poignant movie that looks amazing and will engage you on multiple levels.     This is one movie you will want to enjoy with your child!
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|The price was the best I found for this new CD.  Not a fan of her music, but my daughter is so I was glad it didn't cost me too much money.
0307454541|1.0|**Spoiler alert**<br />Lets first get done with the only positive. The prime puzzle of the novel i.e. \\"Missing Harriet\\" was actually quite crisp and full of potential.<br /><br />Everything else is just superficial and fluff. Some of my pet peeves:<br />- Wiernstiens plot was completely unnecessary to the novel. Remove it and reader would save 200 pages of droll reading. On top of that, this part of the story was, frankly, yawningly boring. This plot was solved easily by an uber computer-hacker, who at will got into the other computers and got all the information. The main characters did not do any human investigation work.<br />- This bring to my second peeve. Invoking uber computer-hacker is very hackneyed and cop-out on solving the mystery. Every superficial Hollywood thriller has done this for last 10 years. This part was very predictable. Worse, the author seemed to have completely missed simple facts about hackers like they do not use Macs. At least, make it a more realistic hacker than creating some super-man caricature hacker. Sigh.<br />- Novel has lots of unnecessary side stories and superfluous details, which become unbearable after a point. Specially the boss and guardians of super-hacker were redundant characters. I would not have minded a shorter but crisper novel.<br />- Last but not least, the novel is full of too many fantastic coincidences. Every detective novel has their impossible yet intriguing passages, yet the author just wanted to have too much fun with them like 65 year unsolved case mentioned to investigator out of blue, killer killing 2-3 murders for more than 30 years and never noticed, fascination with bible and so on. And this fascination of psychopaths with bible angle is plainly getting very old. Give me something original.<br /><br />I wish I had skipped this novel and saved my 8 hours.
0143116371|5.0|I gave this to book to a friend of mine, after opening it i wanted to order one for myself! needless to say she love it and said with in minutes of looking through the book she was inspired for her daily wardrobe.
B0045NXMMQ|3.0|I enjoy Jean Pierre Jeunet films.  That such as Amelie, The City of Lost Children, Delicatessen, and even the more serious story of A Very Long Engagement, but his latest film, this \\"Micmacs\\" really kinda drags.  I mean, it all looks cool, just as his intention usually is of having some cool, visual effects in his story, but the story itself, doesn't quite retain my interest, even after watching this for a second time.<br /><br />I like Jeunet's style.  He has this rather yellowish background atmosphere (as if it was filmed 40 years ago or so), and even has a background score sounds as if it was from ages ago.  And I love that.  His earlier films all reflect that.<br /><br />But, it wasn't enough to help me stay within this story.  I was lost after the first 30 minutes of this film, and I tried to maintain non-boredom from that point forward, but boredom succeeded and I was lost from then on, to the end of the movie.<br /><br />Maybe, uponce my third viewing of this film, I might understand it. I don't know.  We'll see, huh?
B00004U8P9|5.0|While this wasn't the fastest purchase I have received, it definately arrived in a timely manner, especially for the Christmas season. Packaging was perfect & so was the condition of the DVD.
B00142X56Y|5.0|I have owned the DVD of this wonderful performance of \\"Die Zauberflöte\\" and so hesitated before upgrading to Blu-Ray, thinking that there wouldn't be much to be gained. However, for those with large TV screens (ours is 55\\"), the difference is remarkable and I am very glad I upgraded. So clear and crisp is the image that fine details in costumes, props, and makeup (not all of which is seamlessly executed, alas) jump off the screen. As for the performance itself, it's certainly one of the best of this work I've seen. My only concern, though not enough to deduct a star for, is that that some scenes have too tight a focus such that actors not directly on the center of the stage are out of focus, notably in the first few scenes. But the overall beauty of this realization offsets this. Heartily recommended, including for people who may already own the DVD copy.
0062513346|2.0|As I finished The Valkyries I find myself more and more disillusioned with Paulo Coelho. As I learn more and more about the man behind the books, through his own books, I find I don't like what I see.<br /><br />He described it as The Hunter and The Farmer type people in Valkyries. It was in the words of his wife, but it was there. Thing is, even after seeing that reality in himself, I don't think he took the right message from it.<br /><br />He sees himself as The Hunter--going off storming across the country, across the world on this nobel quest. He's spent his life trying to be a priest (Jesuit?) and stopping, getting into Wicca, into Knights Templar (seeing them as holy when many others see a much darker side), into the Tradition. He walks across Spain, he goes into the American desert seeking enlightenment, he hangs with biker chicks on a \\"holy\\" mission. And he continues to feel that \\"living\\" is running around doing these ridiculous rituals, many of which are made up by him or these weird groups. You could stand back and see him in the same way we look at the Incas, making human sacrifices as part of their sacred rituals---it is bizarre, puerile and misguided.<br /><br />In short, he continues to confuse DOING with KNOWING. And to know, all you have to do is shut up, be quiet and realize what you already know. You don't have to run off anywhere to do it, you don't have to GO anywhere, you don't have to \\"fight the good fight\\"--there is no fight to be had, except within himself.<br /><br />The lesson of the Hunter, him, and the Farmer, his wife--was that they were attracted to each other because they both needed to assimilate some of the other in themselves. HE needed to stop hunting and just be. SHE needed sometimes to be open to experiencing that which is put in front of her. And all of it was really HIM not seeing the lesson in front of him.<br /><br />In Valkyries he kept indicating that Heaven (or his equivalent) would only be \\"open\\" for a certain time. And like many right now, he decided that only some of us, the enlightened few, would make it to the evolution of the planet, while the unenlightened masses would go through some sort of purging process.<br /><br />If you understand Light and that it exists for us to see, to feel, for ALL, you couldn't entertain any idea of Us and Them. THEY wouldn't leave anyone behind because they aren't learning lessons fast enough. Any scenario that makes an Us and Them means you haven't yet seen that we all come from One.<br /><br />On to his inability, unwillingness to deal with his own excessive appetites--for women, specifically, and probably for booze. He continues, through all the books, to acknowledge his own filandering, and then goes on to justify it in numerous ways. She doesn't really mind, they have an open marriage, guys are meant to \\"notice\\" other women, women and men are made to be attracted. He is always actively plotting the conquest of the next woman or women, falling \\"in love\\" with the woman of the moment. But somehow he still \\"loves\\" his wife in a special way and expects her to just accept that. He encourages his wife (and himself, of course)to sleep around, and never asked questions because he didn't want questions himself. The fact is, he has never come to terms with his own excessive appetites. These kind of issues block you from the Light, keep you from communication with spirit (Angels in his terminology)--but he hasn't yet really grasped that concept.<br /><br />I did disagree with his terminology, although I think we each get a life view from our society. I have noticed that those raised Hindu or Muslim or Catholic or Protestant--each have their own predisposition to believe in certain ways.<br /><br />But, with great pride in his knowledge, Coelho names off four kinds of beings. One is of spirits passed (who have incarnated). He blows them off as being basically unworthy because they're just \\"men\\" like he is. [Ah, yes, but these \\"men\\" have lived many, manylives, progressed perhaps to no more incarnations. Is their guidance worth nothing? Isn't that the majority of spirit guidance--those who were once carnate because they know the difficulties of being in body? Make sense to me, but he dismisses them as inferior knowledge.]<br /><br />Next he talks about Angels--his whole book (Valkyries) is about finding his, which is apparently like a Master Guide in my terminology. My understanding (and it can be as wrong as his) is that Angels have never incarnated. To me, those who have never incarnated might not be the best Guides.  Then there were two other categories of beings--oh, Saints. What the....? Saints, who become saints only through a religion of some kind? Who were men also, maybe not even really good men, but maybe men who had influence in the church. And were the stories of a particular saint ever right?<br /><br />I do accept that people who pray to specific angels (Archangel Gabriel, Michael) might be contacting some spirit. But are they all communicating with the same Gabriel, Michael? It probably doesn't matter, but likely not.<br /><br />Just like William Buhlman talks about there being a virtually stable \\"thoughtform\\" in astral that is the Pearly Gates--literally, because so many people believe it and visualize it. But it is, nevertheless, a thoughtform also--not a \\"reality\\" (whatever that means).<br /><br />In earlier novels I was disturbed by the violent images in what he was doing. Why a Sword? What spiritual aspirant needs an instrument of war? He refers to it as war, as there being righteous wars (I strongly disagree here), that there was a justification for fighting one's enemies. He calls it \\"the good fight\\". It's more of the Hunter here--just an excuse to be active and not to be within his own soul, higher self. Had he spent more time there, these might have been real novels of discovery not Tipping at Windmills all over the world. And maybe I'm reading too much here, but these novels (Valkyries, Pilgrimage) might have been when he was still in search of power through magic, wicca--and not the White Witch kind of way.<br /><br />Coelho mentions that he \\"did\\" astral travel and he didn't find any passed souls, no higher spirits. Which says to me his energy, his own vibration was not high enough to get out of astral--an indication to him that he should work on those negative-inducing qualities that block out the Light for him.<br /><br />[Over the holidays I watched some movie about a guy with tinnitus (ringing in the ears). It is driving him crazy and his girlfriend finally plays the \\"complement\\" note to what he hears and it wipes out the sound. She says that there is a complementary color for every color (you can see that when you close your eyes), and there is a complement to every note. And that made me wonder if, as souls, we don't \\"see\\" the Light or feel the vibations around us are because we are putting out the negative complement ourselves, blocking ourselves from hearing or seeing. Just a mind detour.]<br /><br />The scene at the end of Valkyries was cr*p to me--the idea that he had to See his angel, and finally accepting military jets as the \\"sign\\". Now, he'd made the distinction earlier that spirit can work through other things--people, animals, and that one could just hear their Angels (but he'd made it clear that wasn't good enough for him. He wanted to See these beings.)<br /><br />But Coelho, lagging behind his wife, who already talked to her angel just by being herself, had to find a shortcut, a way out. His experience in the desert was no different from experiences any of the rest of us have when we feel spirit strongly through nature or whatever is in front of us. But he lies to himself, saying that he finally \\"saw\\" his Angel in the form of light and jets--so that he could end his adventure. Same with his Pilgrimage---he ended it prematurely and took a bus when because he couldn't find the sword.<br /><br />He admitted in the Valkyries that the song lyrics (and I think he implied even some of his earlier books) were written in pursuit of the Devil, of evil power--but that the public was so dumb, they followed him anyway. He happily took it to the bank and continued to write. So, in my mind, this is not the type of writer I want to emulate --or enrich. He doesn't deserve it. His impulses were wrong to begin with. It's one thing if someone is well-meaning but missing the mark. But to intentionally be pursuing evil, write about it and then profit from it--maybe explains why he is so apologetic about his owb success. He truly doesn't deserve it. There are far more honest and deserving voices out there.--and not the White Witch kind of way.      Coelho mentions that he \\"did\\" astral travel and he didn't find any passed souls, no higher spirits. Which says to me his energy, his own vibration was not high enough to get out of astral--an indication to him that he should work on those negative-inducing qualities that block out the Light for him.

His experience in the desert was no different from experiences any of the rest of us have when we feel spirit strongly through nature or whatever is in front of us. But he lies to himself, saying that he finally \\"saw\\" his Angel in the form of light and jets--so that he could end his adventure. Same with his Pilgrimage---he ended it prematurely and took a bus when because he couldn't find the sword.      He admitted in the Valkyries that the song lyrics (and I think he implied even some of his earlier books) were written in pursuit of the Devil, of evil power--but that the public was so dumb, they followed him anyway. He happily took it to the bank and continued to write. So, in my mind, this is not the type of writer I want to emulate --or enrich. He doesn't deserve it. His impulses were wrong to begin with. It's one thing if someone is well-meaning but missing the mark. But to intentionally be pursuing evil, write about it and then profit from it--maybe explains why he is so apologetic about his owb success. He truly doesn't deserve it. There are far more honest and deserving voices out there.
B002DYKP8S|5.0|I saw this in theaters and loved it so i figured I'd buy it on Bluray. The picture is amazing. Unlike some other posts, i haven't noticed any dips in the audio. Get this movie, watch it with subtitles on, enjoy!
1569242739|5.0|Just a quickey review.  My daughter is vegan and I am not.  I have tried baking cupcakes from regular recipes and they were terrible!  These recipes are easy and I have not baked a single bad cupacke out of this book.   This is the best cookbook I have ever bought!  I started baking & eating the cupcakes and lost weight!  Best investment I ever made.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I thought this movie was gonna suck when i saw the trailers for it. My friends kept saying how sweet it was so i gave it a shot and ended up liking it a lot. Bluray makes the colors pop. Story is good, though the main character is quite a d-bag at times. I think its clear that Hit Girl is the most bad ass character in that movie. Everyone should get this and give it a shot.
0765326353|4.0|Where's the next book Brandon?<br /><br />Starting a series when there were more than half a million words left to write for Robert Jordan's massive epic series may be a disservice to all us. No, it is a disservice.<br /><br />In a previous look at Sanderson's work, I noted how ingenious the man was about magic. He still is. One of the things he does really well is Magic, though this book has less of that and much more of a world building feel to it. Gods who have really screwed things up a really long time ago it seems to me. Now the slow development of people whose agendas are one thing but morph as they are shaped into something else works well.<br /><br />There is a feeling though that we are given part of the world as Sanderson thinks it up. Not that it was done before he started to write.<br /><br />This I think may cause confusion and lead to paradoxes. There may even have already been such, but with so much meat, hard for me to follow. The end was a surprise and thus, my need for more. More that his other commitments don't allow him to write.<br /><br />That is something I think that should have been considered. Perhaps Tor holding this book and releasing it late this year before the end of the Jordan saga with books two and three to follow within months would have been much more fair and I would have given this a ten. I feel used by the process and so downgrade my review. It is a multi book epic and when will it end? How long will it take? Ten books and ten years? That is too much and too long.
1439177783|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  This true story is told with such passion and flow that you feel like you are reading a novel.  It is amazing this is a true story. Portia is a terrific writer. I can't wait to read this book again.  Hopefully she will come out with another.  Ellen is right when she says this is a must read!

I definitely recommend Nicholas Sparks followers read his latest book.

B001LF347E|5.0|A friend actually let me borrow the first season, and I was a little skeptical, but then WOW.  The writers are excellent.  The cast is lovable, and you just want to keep watching more.  The biggest drawback of this show is that is is made in Europe, so you have to wait so long to see the series.  It's on it's third season as of 29 Dec 10, and you can only find the first on here in the states.  If they would market this in the US, Im sure it would be a big hit.  You actually feel like your living in the Medieval times, and the humor is awesome.

B0021L8V0M|1.0|I'm a little shocked at some of the glowing reviews of this movie. First off, I am a conspiracy buff and love action movies with a \\"thinking man\\" element to them. This movie's action sequences were ridiculously implausible. Granted, some of that is to be expected. But, it's the plot that makes this movie absurd.    *Spoiler Alert*    At one point in the movie, Jolie crosses her CIA colleagues at which point they discover that she's not what she appears to be. It turns out she's a Russian spy with links to Russian companies. How did they discover this? By simply searching their database!! Are we supposed to believe the CIA doesn't screen these people and know who they are inside and out?    Somehow, the KGB orchestrated a grandiose plan (taking some 30 years in the making) in which they train various assassins from childhood to assassinate an American president. This depends on Jolie escaping all sorts of impossible scenarios, taking out dozens of intelligence agents and police along the way. If landing unscathed on her back on a moving truck from a bridge wasn't enough for you, Jolie never gets hurt in the whole movie. Expert shooters also can never seem to connect from 10 feet away either. This movie takes the cake for most number of guys getting knocked unconscious for seemingly benign blows.     One of the more outrageous plot points was the Russian spy who \\"leaks\\" to the CIA that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Russian-trained spy. He reveals that it was Oswald who killed JFK. Of course, the CIA has no idea that the lone gunman theory is patently false.     At the end, the CIA is double-crossed by another agent they had no idea about! Apparently, anyone can lie to the CIA and they are none the wiser.    Too many plot holes to get into coupled with Jolie as the terribly cast double-agent.  I could write a list of 20 or 30 unbelievable points in this movie, but suffice it to say, spend your money on a real conspiracy/action movie.
B001FB5634|2.0|This is the most relentlessly bleak, grey, mind-numbingly monotonous movie I've ever had the misfortune to see -- and I ran it after watching \\"Blindness,\\" an equally dark but more violent and institutionalized end-of-the-world story.  By the end of the night, suicide would have been a step UP.    I like gritty realism, and I don't require happy endings (my favorite world-ender is \\"On the Beach,\\" where EVERYONE dies)... but \\"The Road\\" was dismal beyond belief. It was leavened by no trace of plot, enlightening dialogue, or psychological revelation. The initializing catastrophe remains a mystery; no survivors get together to even speculate on the nature of it. In the savagery that follows, the finer qualities of human nature are dismissed as, apparently, the artificial construct of a vanished civilization. Cannibalism abounds, and I challenge this assumption:  In a country where the stores & apartments in ANY city center would have stored MILLIONS of tons of food for its vanished populace (not to mention enough weapons, warm clothing & SHOES to last decades), why would the survivors descend so quickly into cannibalism? I just don't buy it. The few humans portrayed as surviving, COULD NOT have used up (or even collected & hoarded) all that would be left behind. Fagodsake -- find a Walmart, idiots.    I also don't buy that \\"none of the animals survived.\\" If pockets of people survived, then so did some animals. Dogs and other canids would certainly have gotten through (so many would've shared human shelters) -- if only by feeding on us. (A scene like this was actually shown in \\"Blindness\\" -- and I found that reasonable.)    There is constant tension in this film -- but little actual suspense. The cannibals & other \\"bad guys\\" coming home early, became a predictable plot-device; the writers had no other vehicle for supplying actual drama. (The constant repetition of \\"Papa\\" isn't drama.)  And in the scene where cannibals are chasing a woman through a field, to strike down &EAT her: I challenge that premise as well. In a post-apocalyptic world, women would become almost as treasured a commodity as food & water. Virtually EVERY savage society in our past, has shown us this.    And as one viewer commented -- why leave a supply-packed shelter, to sleep in the cold rain? Is this believable, with a small boy to feed?      At the end, Viggo Mortenson lies dead on the beach, his straggly beard pointing skyward. (His death became inevitable for the viewer, as soon as that first soap-opera cough was heard.) His death was not as gripping, for me, as the director probably intended: I kept waiting to see if his adam's apple would move and give him away.    Here's how bad this post-apocalyptic \\"thriller\\" was:  I would rather watch Kevin Costner in \\"The Postman.\\"
0307266303|5.0|I was captivated by the story behind the tribe of superathletes in this book.

I don't read many books like this, but my wife got me this book for Christmas and I loved every moment of it.

If you have not read it, don't be intimidated by all the rave reviews, just open it up and read it.  If you don't agree, you will still have had the pleasure of knowing intimately the wonderful characters of Steinbecks East of Eden as if they were your own extended family, a truely great gift from such a talented author.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I see a lot of movies in the theater, around one-hundred a year.  I cannot remember a movie that had the audience clapping as much as they did in the showing of Secretariat I attended.  A guy in the row behind me was audibly sobbing.  I'm probably jaded, but I didn't find Secretariat that emotional a film.  But I found it a great film, great acting and great cinematography.  I think a lot of people in the audience were horse lovers, maybe small business or housewife admirers.  Maybe all three.  But I swear I have not seen such a emotional reaction in any film I have attended.  Do yourself a favor and buy this film.  See what everyone got so riled up about.

032147404X|2.0|Kelby is a photoshop and gear nerd.  Which is awesome!  I'm a photo nerd myself.  This book however is more nerdy than beneficial.  He mentions a simple thing like a backdrop.  Then he says that you can light it, not light it, add a gel to make it a different color.  Then states that you can buy them.  I think that 90% of the suggestions/tips in this book are for grandma or grandpa who have never thought about photography.  Almost every tip, to me, is so obvious that I think every semi pro should already know.      This is a great book for people who know nothing and for people that would rather read about shooting rather than shooting themselves.  Save your money, go to a book store that carries this book, sit and read it for free.  I just finished volume 2 and it took about 40 minutes.      Most of Kelby's humor goes away quickly and he gets right into photography.  I just think that he states the obvious hundreds of times and doesn't elaborate well.      I would say that I did learn some great tips in this book.  I wish I would have borrowed it from a friend.  I spent $30 on this and volume 2.  I should have seen a movie, got a coffee and read it at the mega mall bookstore.      Do your own research on the internet for free.
0307454541|4.0|Scandinavian crime and mystery novels are somewhat different in style and approach than the Anglo-American versions and this first volume of a trilogy is no exception. For one thing, it progresses very slowly, especially at the beginning, and the back-stories of the principal characters are presented at very great length. But you should stick with it, because by the time you get eighty or a hundred pages in, you'll be hooked. Mikael Blomkvist is a financial reporter and part-owner of a well-regarded small investigative magazine who has just lost a libel action brought by a suspiciously-connected billionaire. He not only will have to pay a whopping settlement, he'll also have to spend a few months in a minimum-security prison -- quite a difference from the American system of civil litigation. Worse than that, of course, his professional credibility is now in serious question and the advertisers are beginning to pull out of the magazine. Meanwhile, we meet young Lisbeth Salander, a personal investigator for a security firm and of a rather tattooed and punkish persuasion -- and perhaps a borderline psychopath, as she herself recognizes. She's had a very hard life so far and the various predators whom she has had to survive have left their marks. But she never forgets and she always gets even. On the other hand, she's one of the best there is at her job. Blomkvist (whom Salander has just been assigned to compile a detailed background dossier on) is invited by Henrik Vanger, an aging industrialist, to take a one-year assignment ghosting his tell-all autobiography, which might be just the break Blomkvist needs, as well as a way to get out of the limelight for awhile. But that's just the cover story. In 1964, Vanger's sixteen-year-old niece, Harriet, disappeared from the small northern coastal town where most of the Vanger family live (and which they practically own) under very suspicious circumstance. No trace at all ever was found of her, though Henrik assumes she's long dead. But he's getting old, he's been systematically investigating the tragedy himself for decades, and he wants Blomkvist the investigative journalist to go over everything one last time. He just has to know what happened to Harriet. And at the end of the year, whether Blomkvist uncovers any new evidence or not, Henrik will let him in on the secret knowledge that will allow him to torpedo the suspicious billionaire once and for all. Can't pass up an offer like that. Blomkvist thinks the whole think is a waste of time but he's willing to give it a good-faith effort. And then, of course, certain details lead to certain reinterpretations (the reader will be smacking himself on the forehead and thinking, \\"Yes, of course!\\"), and suddenly the case seems solvable. However, a different sort of investigative talent will be needed, and that's where Salander comes in. And one of the best themes of the book is the way in which the two learn to deal with each other, and especially how Salander slowly finds she needs someone she can trust. There are a lot of minor cultural oddities in the story that American readers might raise an eyebrow at, but this is, by and large, a plot that could be set almost anywhere. (I know there's a movie coming out and I'll be curious to see how it handles them.) As I said, it's a slow starter but becomes engrossing soon enough, and it picks up speed in the last third, including a couple of truly horrific scenes. Highly recommended.dead.

B0032Y8XH8|4.0|From the title song, you realize this will be pretty different.  \\"Man is a giddy thing?\\" Really?  But this collection of gothic bluegrass alt country...I give up trying to put it in a genre. Sparse arrangements put emphasis on vocals and lyrics, but the banjos kick in and you're transported into a different place. Emotions are on full display here with songs like \\"White Blank Page\\" and \\"I Gave You All\\" almost leave you breathless with rawness of them, but then you focus on awkward lines like \\"But your tears fell warm as they fall on my forearm,\\" from the latter and you realize there's still some work to do here. Songs like \\"Timshel,\\" and \\"Thistle and Weeds\\" just wander around aimlessly, while the sing song rhythm of \\"Awake My Soul\\" and the darkly intense \\"Dust Bowl Dance\\" fascinate.  But the overall feel is a smart, funny group that will have plenty to say in the future.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|If I judged this album by its cover, it'd be great.  It looks very down-to-earth.  However, I found the music and lyrics to be bombastic and vapid.  The production is American late 70s/early 80s AOR but with acoustic instruments.  It seems to me like it's trying to be grand and epic in scale, but when you get inside, it's just ... empty, and lacking of substance.  Rack up the unhelpful votes for me and enjoy this piece of nothingness.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|This starts with nothing particularly catchy, the arrangements just meander around and eventually the sound put me into a stupor. Songs like, \\"First Flash of Freedom,\\" a throwback to the guitar and organ noodlings (Anybody remember Dennis Coffey?) of some bad 70's rock is typical of the bad mix of songs at the beginning of MOJO   I didn't find much to like until I got to the countrified \\"Candy\\" (track 5) and things pick up rapidly with the rocking regret of \\"I Should Have Known It\\" and the stripped down Delta blues on \\"U.S. 41;\\" a song sounding like it was recorded off an old radio broadcast. But it drops back into the doldrums with snoozers like the reggae light of \\"Don't Pull Me Over,\\" and the tortuous \\"Lover's Touch.\\" The rest of the way it continues to be pretty forgettable and far from one of Petty's better efforts.

1439177783|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but was a little disappointed.  There were some really big issues in here--body image, eating disorders, the American media, being in the closet and coming out to family...etc.  I feel like in the hands of a more experienced writer they could have come across much more elegantly.  Instead, the book becomes incredibly repetitive and (I hate to say this given the topics she was writing about, but here goes) comes off as whiny and pitiful.  The epilogue has turned out to be the most enjoyable part for me.  I'm not even entirely sure why it's an epilogue instead of just an ending chapter.  I think Portia is an amazing woman in an obviously loving relationship, and I am happy for her happy ending. I just think the book could have benefited from a ghost writer or maybe some better editing.
B003UESJGK|4.0|The characters get to the truth of the situation within their conversations and that moves them from now to the next now with a clean slate. Strangely enough the best communications always involve the truth which isn't easy to do within the setting of a movie. The other reviews can give you details about plot and overall story I'll just say it's the most honest and adult relationship movie I've seen all year.

0465011047|5.0|This book is an eye opener. People need to be aware of what is happening in North Korea.  Human rights are violated, only the elite matter, the dictater Kim Jong il (Or Kim Mentally il) only gives a darn about himself, its bad enough this happens to adults but for it to spill over to children and others in a persons family is way out there and crossing the line.    We need to listen to this account and think of the child in a prison who comitted no crime and gets punished because his uncle said something that I'm sure was true.    George Orwell said \\"In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act\\".    and    \\"Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\\"       I am glad Kang Chol-hwan ( question to any Koreans on here reading this how do you refer to names in a shorten version?) got away and was able to come here and tell this story.  I believe all people in North Korea have a story to tell and they should be able to somehow share it with the rest of the world.
0596522347|5.0|This is a great resource for anyone that wants to create presentations that standout from all the bullet points out there--no darting for cover necessary. Slide:ology, helps develop every aspect of a great presentation. We've all sat through presentations where the font is so small you can't read it from the front row. The worse part is listening to the presenter read the slide to you in a frightened, monotone voice. Why would anyone create a presentation that they have to read to you? It's crazy!    One of the problem I had to over come was from the \\"curse of knowledge\\". For some reason most presenters feel the need to inundate you with information. An expert in their field generally attempts to share knowledge that's taken them 20 years to accumulate in a 10 to 30 minute presentation. Not going to happen. Most presentations are intended to introduce an audience to an concept or product not share every detail. It's kind of like that first date where they told you everything about themselves--starting with kindergarten. This book has helped me to narrow down the important aspects of a presentation as well as  my website and blog ([...]). It provides several samples for inspiration as well as a website.

0887307280|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book--again, for the second time. I saw myself as a young designer and so many friends and colleagues who had chosen the road of freelancing. Although I haven't been a freelancer for years, I still have extremely talented friends who slave away at their computer, nestled in a cozy little nook of their homes, a converted basement, closet, or garage.    After rereading this book I decided it was the best gift I could give to my friends who were still trying to do everything themselves and hating every minute of it. At least most of them have bookkeepers but they still haven't made it past this stage yet they continue to hang on and yes many of them have lost their passion--years ago. The mortgage and college funds keep them locked into work they no longer enjoy. They shake their heads at me from time to time wondering how I did it. I've never kept it a secret yet they couldn't step out of their comfort zones. Instead of waiting for them to buy the book I've finally bought it for them. Hopefully this will do it.    This book is one of the reasons I expand my own business. I stopped thinking like a designer and started thinking like a business owner. But like most things in life I needed a refresher coarse--a jolt of inspiration. It was great rereading this book. I'm already revising my approach now that I've been reminded of the ideas and concepts in this book--great stuff. I share many of the principals of this book in my blog which is focused on brand development (carl-designs.blogspot.com).    My business is still small, by design, but I have a great client base. Too, I'm still involved in the creative process but building and maintaining my business is my first priority. I owe it to The E Myth.

The players are now cheap, but the Hi-Def TV's you also have to have are NOT CHEAP AT ALL.  I watch Blu-Rays only on my Dell Studio XPS 1640 with it's 1080p screen.  That's the only thing I can afford right now.      I hope some of the people who worked on this restoration Blu-Ray see this, my hat is off to you all, you did a beautiful job.  THANK YOU.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|They say that if you 'suspend disbelief' for some movies then you will like it. With this film I coudn't do it. This movie is way over the top unbelievable. And thus I couldn't get into it. The director copies the film style and editing techniques of the Jason Bourne movies. The Bourne movies you will recall were hugely successful and had great action scenes. When Bourne took on other super elite spies you got the feeling of danger, that he could be killed or captured. Not here. The skinny armed heroine takes on a bunch of SWAT guys in hand to hand combat with no problem, takes on a whole ship full of nasty Russians again with no problem. This movie was reportedly slotted for T. Cruise but he turned it down/had other projects to work on. Jolie gets it and there is apparently no script rewrite to show the difference of how a female spy would vanquish her foes.<br /><br />The plot shows Salt as a dedicated trusted US trained spy. But evidence comes to light that shows she assisted Russian spies. Rather than explain herself, tell how it's all wrong, she goes on the run and the audience is left to wonder what side she is truly on. Fair enough, but again the action scenes are so preposterous that I lost interest. The usual good work of British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (Redbelt, Serenity & Children of Men) is wasted here. I don't want to give anything away but when you see the scene where she, a presumed rogue Russian killer, has to get to the President at the WH and they know she's coming yet still pulls it off - then you will know that it is a ridiculous waste. Rather than waste $ on this 2nd rate film I would recommend these way better espionage films as substitutes - of course you can't go wrong with the previously mentioned Bourne films. Also 'Body of Lies' with DiCaprio, 'Ronin' with Deniro or even 'Scorpio'(old school) with Burt Lancaster. All way better.

B003X2O6MK|5.0|No other artist has put more emotion, creativity, and soul into an album like Kanye West did with what is arguably his magnum opus. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a 70-minute sonic landscape of braggadocio, intellect, raw emotion, fear, sadness, boastfulness, pride, lust, temptation, and sincerity. Kanye West is a master at his craft, and whether people want to recognize that or not, that is undeniable.
0312360258|5.0|I've read the Twillight series and now the House of Night series.  I have to say I far more enjoyed the House of Night Series.  Kept you guessing on what was going to happen next.  I've already pre-ordered the next book.
014241543X|5.0|I am in 8th grade. When I started reading this book, I  had some doubts about whether or not i would like it. But after reading it, I absolutely love this book. It is my new favorite. It makes you think about what you would do in her position. Her family has gotten in a bloody car wreck and only Mia,the herione,survived. She struggles with a decision that will change the course of her life forever. She has to choose to stay or die. It is a sad, realistic book that makes you recognize the people in your life and appreciate them more. The main thing from this book I learned was that you need to appreciate and love the people in your life before they aren't there anymore.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|If you like the books and movies, this product sells itself. Extra/deleted scenes are just more of what everyone wants so no way to go wrong with those. Commentary by RP and KS and director again is the reason we wait to buy. Of course they always leave us wanting more but I enjoyed the extras in this set and felt I got my moneys worth. I believe most fans of the book and movie Sagas would as well. Nice collectors item.

The seller has not contacted me back for any resolution.  I purchased 3 DVD's before Christmas and had a problem with every one.  I probably won't be buying DVD's online anymore - although I don't have any bad feelings for Amazon - the sellers need to be responsible for their products.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Ever since he spun the \\"[[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman]]\\" franchise on its head half a decade ago, there's been an increasingly significant level of quality expected from writer/director Christopher Nolan. If his latest creation is any indication, Nolan sure knows how to execute a brilliant idea even when under the most intense of pressure. His latest affair, the mind-bending \\"Inception,\\" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who extracts thoughts and ideas from people by entering their dreams. When a job goes wrong, he is offered a chance at redemption. This time he has to introduce an idea into the mind of a subject rather than steal it away. It's an easy enough task, right? Wrong. As he soon finds out, plunging into the depths of uncharted waters is especially tricky when carrying your own personal baggage. To quote Arnold Schwarzenegger in \\"[[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]]\\": \\"It's the best mind**** yet!\\"<br /><br />\\"Inception\\" boasts an impressive cast. DiCaprio aside, we are treated to some of the finest young talent Hollywood has to offer by way of Ellen Page, Cilian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The actors - while excellent in their roles - are but a pawn in Nolan's game. Fact of the matter is he could have cast a group of no-names and the film would still be as great as it is. The true star of the film is not only the insanely well-crafted script which will have you second-guessing yourself at every turn, but the stunning visuals that accompany it. Watching this movie is like stepping into an alternate universe where anything you could imagine is possible. Nolan asks us to suspend disbelief as we follow the film's characters through layers of dreams. Because the script is water-tight and the visuals so flawless, we are fooled easily enough. Like children, we believe whole-heartedly in what we see unfold before us even if we aren't quite sure of how it all works.<br /><br />While Nolan has had a pretty consistent track-record thus far, it still comes as a shock that \\"Inception\\" is as good as it is. The term is thrown around loosely all too often, but the film is a heavy contender for best film of the year. More than that, though, this is Nolan's masterpiece. The director's perfectionist streak shows through in a film that truly has no flaws. It may take a few viewings to completely wrap your head around, but there is not an inch of celluloid wasted. There is not a line uttered without importance and not a special effect that looks artificial. To step into the world of \\"Inception\\" is to step into another dimension where films can still be magical and blow the minds of even the most jaded of movie-goers. A dream come true indeed.<br /><br />Oh, and was I the only one expecting to hear Tom Petty's \\"Free Fallin'\\" during the scenes where the van falls off the bridge? I hope not.as good as it is.

B000HWZ5VU|5.0|Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant released his first solo album entitled Pictures at Eleven in June of 1982 on Led Zeppelin's record label Swan Song (distributed by Atlantic and WEA).<br />Following the untimely death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, the band decided that Bonham was irreplaceable and decided to disband Led Zeppelin out of respect for Bonham in December of 1980. While bass player John Paul Jones went on sabbatical from music, guitarist Jimmy Page delved into the soundtrack to Death Wish II (which was released in February of 1982 to limited success) and lead singer/lyricist Robert Plant retired to his family. In early 1982 he went back in the studio this time Rockfield Studios in Wales (where Rush had recorded their A Farewell to Kings and Hemispheres albums) to record Plant's first solo album. Joining Robert (who produces the album with engineer Pat Moran) are Robert's fellow Welsh musicians guitarist Robbie Blunt, bass player Paul Martinez and keyboard player Jezz Woodroofe (who was Black Sabbath's off-stage keyboard player from 1975-77). The drumming duties on the album are mainly handled by Genesis singer/drummer Phil Collins on six of the album's eight tracks (he's also on the bonus tracks) while ex-Rainbow and future Whitesnake/ELPowell/Brian May drummer (the late) Cozy Powell would drum on two of the tracks.<br />We begin the album with the album's first and biggest rock radio and MTV single \\"Burning Down One Side\\" which reminds listeners of Robert's latter days with Led Zeppelin. The song was the biggest hit from the album. Next is the nice ballad \\"Moonlight in Samosa\\" which has nice acoustic work from Blunt and nice music throughout the track with Robert singing his heart out. Next was the album's second single and another rock radio hit rocker called \\"Pledge Pin\\" which has a great guitar riff from Blunt, lyrics from Plant and also nice sax solos from Raphael Ravenscroft (famous for his sax solo on Gerry Rafferty's \\"Baker Street\\"). We close the first half with the nearly eight minute \\"Slow Dancer\\" which reminds me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\" and this too got loads of rock radio play over the years. Robert's vocals on this track shows he could still scream plus Blunt's guitar work is phenomenal as was the late Cozy Powell's drumming on this track reminds one of the late John Bonham.<br />We begin side two of the album with the six minute \\"Worse Than Detroit\\" which is driven by Blunt's slide guitar work and Phil Collins' superb drumming and Robert singing greatly and also playing some scorching harmonica here. Next is the drum machine driven \\"Fat Lip\\" which is a nice slower tempo number with Robert singing his heart out. We then go to \\"Like I've Never Been Gone\\" which is another great power ballad and the stars of this track were Robbie Blunt and Cozy Powell and lest not forget the star of the album Mr Plant himself. We close things with the uptempo rocker \\"Mystery Title\\" which is another great song driven by Blunt's guitar, Collins' drumming and Plant's vocals.<br />With Pictures at Eleven, Robert Plant proved that he would survive without Led Zeppelin. Pictures at Eleven is still (in my mind anyhow) his best solo album from a musical and lyrical standpoint and was successful commercially going to #3 here in the US in the summer of 1982 and also went Platinum (a million or so sold in copies) in its first year of release.<br />In 2006, the album was remastered and first re-released on the Nine Lives box set. Then in 2007 (to celebrate Pictures At Eleven's 25th anniversary), the remastered CD album was re-released individually with two bonus tracks. One was \\"Far Post\\" which was left off the album and the other a great live version of \\"Like I've Never Been Gone\\".<br />RECOMMENDED!close the first half with the nearly eight minute \\"Slow Dancer\\" which reminds me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\" and this too got loads of rock radio play over the years.

B004EV18W0|5.0|Pageturner, alzheimers and novel aren't three words you'd normally expect to see in the same sentence, and yet they go together to describe Still Alice, the debut from Simon & Schuster by Lisa Genova. When I saw the blurb I was a bit reluctant to start reading, thinking the subject would be depressing and stressful. How wrong I was.    Still Alice is a remarkable novel that will change the way you view alzheimers and the way you respond to people with this condition. It will change the way you think about alzheimers if you are ever diagnosed with it, and will certainly influence the way you relate to people close to you if they become affected. If you are already living with alzheimers, as a patient or as a friend, relative or professional, Still Alice is a novel you should take a look at.    Genova puts us right inside the experience of alzheimers by telling this story through the first person narrative of Alice, a university professor who is just 50 when she gets her diagnosis. She knows exactly what this will mean because, like Genova, she is a neuroscience specialist. The novel opens with Alice at her most capable intellectually - known in academic circles for her amazing ability to remember the detailed facts of her subject, including where precisely to find the quotes to reference research papers.    Alice relaxes by jogging round her town, knowing the map of the area and loving her independence. Admired by her colleagues and loved by her husband and daughters, she's the type of career woman and successful family organiser many would aspire to emulate. Like us, she puts the first signs of memory loss down to trying to do too many things at once, but the diagnosis comes quite early in the novel. After that, due to her professional expertise, she knows how to recognise and chart her own progress into alzheimers and how she feels she should prepare for what is to come.    This knowledge also lets her find strategies to cope with each stage and to plan for what she wants to do when it goes too far. She knows she won't be able to remember how or why she will want to end it all at a certain stage, so she leaves instructions for herself that she hopes she will follow regardless. Her Blackberry soon becomes her way of giving herself a To Do list to follow, as memory fails, and it has one important instruction of how to find the means of suicide on the day she can't remember the answer to a few simple questions.    Once she no longer remembers simple information about her family she feels it will be time to use some items she has prepared to kill herself. Many of us would feel we would want to do the same. But as the story progresses, as we really feel what it is like to be Alice, will we still want her to commit suicide at that key moment or will we see alzheimers in a different way? Will Alice manage to go through with her initial plan right to the end?    I won't spoil Still Alice by giving you the answers to this. All I can say is that suicide won't be a plan I'll be making if I ever get this diagnosis, and I'll remember Alice if ever those close to me are affected by alzheimers. I will never see this condition in the same way again, and that's a remarkable achievement by a novelist writing about such an important subject. On a purely stylistic level, Genova never swerves from her course of only seeing this through Alice's eyes, and once we start this experience with her we can't stop reading until we see it through.
0061537969|5.0|Wow, what a wonderful book.  This is the kind of book that when you finish reading it...you become really sad.  You will hate it when it's over.  I became very engrossed in the lives of Denny, his wife and daughter and of course: Enzo.  If you choose to read this book, you will not be disappointed.  I really hate the sport of car racing.  I almost didn't buy the book for that reason.  However, I learned so much about life through car racing after reading Enzo's story.  I wonder if my dog has a book in her?  Fantastic book!
B000O174CM|1.0|This movie was horrible.  It would not play on one of my DVD players.  When I did get it to play, it was skipping and pausing constantly.  I will never buy another movie from this seller.  I am very disappointed.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I bought this recently to watch during this holiday season.  I had seen The Ref and Muppet Christmas Carol so many times I needed a change.  I love the story of this movie.  Will Ferrell is an elf named Buddy who sneaked into Santa's sack one Christmas night.  His adopted dad eventually tells him about his real dad and Buddy sets off to find him.  A great story of the impact working adults can have on those around them including their spouse.  In the end relationships are fixed for the better and everyone is able to celebrate.  I love stories like this and I will watch this movie for many years to come because of the comedy and story.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|It seems to me that the chief complaint about this album is the production.  That, however, is the least of my concerns.  I prefer to listen to the music itself, and pay close attention to the lyrics.  The song \\"Just For Today,\\" for instance, speaks to me.  It is a song that I can relate to.  George seems to bring that quality out in a lot of his work.    And the rest of the album is wonderful too.  \\"Fish on the Sand,\\" \\"Devil's Radio\\" and \\"When We Was Fab\\" are excellently rocked out.  It just kicks, plain and simple.    This album is one of the few that I can listen to, beginning to end, without skipping a single song.  This is George's masterpiece.  I'm sure I'll take heat for this but I like it better than \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  I am not in to religious music that much; I like good, old-fashioned rock and roll.  And on this album, George delivers just that, with flying colors.    This album is a joy to listen to.  If you listen to it, you too will be on cloud 9.
1600242405|1.0|It is probably the WORST edited CD I've ever listened to.  Words and sentences have been cut off or repeated.  At this point, if they had to, they could have used one more CD to do a good job.   I have to a library to know what some of the content is.    This is constant on all CDs, not just once in a while.    NOT HAPPY AT ALL..................    The content is very good and I am enjoying learning more of the Life of Keith.  I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and this is reason I purchased to begin with.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is was my first Jillian DVD - I'm an active girl. I like working out at home because it's convenient. After 30 days I can say I am very happy. I love that the work outs are quick and effective. You'll absolutely work up a sweat. Every level of the workouts creates a new challenge for your body and it's never boring or repetitive. Because of a knee injury there was a time I thought I would never be able to do superstar jumps, or jumping lunges, but after 30 days I'm able to do all of the tough level 3 workout maneuvers, I feel strong and my knee injury no longer bothers me. My thighs and butt have slimmed down, my tummy is toned, my arms look great and I've dropped 1 dress size. What I like best is my body is looking slim and firm, not bulky and built. I love Jillians attitude, she keeps me motivated and feeling good. Although I've completed the 30 day shred, I still continue to do it and have added No More Trouble Zones into the mix!

B0034G4P7G|5.0|When `The Social Network' sweeps the Oscars (which it, inevitably, is going to do) it will be the first time since 1984 when Oscars Best Picture winner will match up with the film I deem to be the best of the given year (for those interested, 1984 was when `Amadeus' took the gold; and if you haven't seen it then you MUST IMMEDIATELY).  The fact remains that `The Social Network' is not only the best reviewed film of the year, it is the best reviewed film of the past decade, and while I don't think it deserves that title (I am completely in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's camp for `Film of the Aughts') it would certainly be the Academy's best choice in YEARS.<br /><br />Like I've said to nearly every single person I've talked to; BELIEVE THE HYPE!<br /><br />I have a strange feeling there is going to be lots of YELLING in this review...<br /><br />In determining the best way to go about attempting to write a review for this film, I basically decided that it was best to just do it in pieces, master `pieces'.  In other words; I'm just going to throw out my current thoughts in random order and hope it all fits together nicely.  Contemplating a decisive and cohesive review for this film just seems wrong to me.  My extreme excitement for this film has me all sorts of giddy and so that seems like the perfect template for dissecting the films utter greatness.<br /><br />The first master `piece' comes at the film's outset; a masterfully crafted opening sequence that utilizes cold stares and quick witted dialog to establish character persona and eventual developments.  It is the single best opening sequence I've seen on film in a long time (I think I mentioned this fact while highlighting the brilliance that was `Inglorious Basterds' opening moments).  The sparring between Rooney Mara and Jesse Eisenberg was FLAWLESS and really set the perfect tone for Fincher's finest film.<br /><br />SPEAKING ON TONE; what Fincher does here is just incredible.  The way he creates something so dark and complex and fascinatingly enticing out of what could have been nothing more than a conventional `teen flick' is beyond commendable.<br /><br />HAND HIM THE OSCAR!<br /><br />Seriously, there is not a false note here.  The film moves at the desired pace, never lagging but knowing not to move too quickly so as to skip over necessary plot points and character arcs.  By breaking moments down with ease, Fincher elaborates on his character's inner monologue with keen insight and a sharpness that keeps the film very `cool' and `likable'; which is a feat to accomplish when your main protagonist is not very likable or cool.<br /><br />But then again, who needs to be cool when you are Jesse Eisenberg or Andrew Garfield or Armie Hammer or Justin Timberlake...or really anyone in the cast?<br /><br />Yes, a major master `piece' here is the flawless cast, all of whom handle their respective roles with enough concentrated naturalism to balance out the youthful arrogance and otherworldly naivety to create honest portraits of American youth.  With a smug sense of arrogance that never once betrays his peering honesty; Eisenberg understands how to carry this film, making Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg nearly sympathetic.  He is never fully justified in his naivety, but he is (in a way) forgiven thanks to the self-loathing with which Eisenberg layers his character's shell.  He is pathetically jealous and painstakingly ambitious, but his actions never feel evil or malicious because Eisenberg breathes a very real life into his eyes and makes this man less a monster and more a human being.  Justin Timberlake reeks of charisma, which is expected, and it is more than enough to establish his take on Sean Parker to be noteworthy and effective.  Armie Hammer takes on two characters, twins, and evokes separate when complementary personalities to each; which is a marvelous feat (I honestly thought he was played by TWO actors, he was that detailed in each approach).  For methough, the star of the show is easily Andrew Garfield.  The way he layers Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's (former) best friend, is stunningly effective and poignant.  He always decidedly supporting, giving heft to Eisenberg as the true start, but he makes the most of his moments and underscores the films more central themes.<br /><br />Which brings me back to Fincher.  Like I said; I'm shooting this off as it pops into my head.  When considering the directorial masterclass that Fincher showed up with here, I'm just astonished (and his Oscar win will be my absolute FAVORITE of the evening).  Creating a mood and setting a tone is one thing, but the most important thing a director can do is add texture to that mood, and Fincher does that in spades.  The way he uses imagery to propel the central themes of the film is also another astonishing trick that further imbeds the films core into the mind of the audience without browbeating us with a `message'.  It creates an air of simplicity within a world of complexities.<br /><br />It feels effortless.<br /><br />One of my friends even likened the films `rowing' sequence, which almost feels like a scene from a different film (cut, paste, celebrate), to Spielberg's opening sequence in `Saving Private Ryan', and while I'm not quick to personally make the connection; I can see the reasoning behind his comparison.  Fincher understood how to parallel the films central themes of power, ambition, loyalty, failure and vengeance with the actual `goings on' surrounding the film without making them so obvious they feel manipulated.<br /><br />EFFORTLESS.<br /><br />And now my mind is racing over to the films brilliant use of cinematography; which also causes me to think about the effective use of (or non-use of) lighting; all of which added layers to the films tone.<br /><br />And that score; O.M.G.<br /><br />Knowing that I really need to start wrapping this up is killing me.  SO MUCH TO SAY SO MUCH TO SAY, but alas, I will try and close this up like so; this movie is far more than you'd expect.  Yes, this a movie about Facebook and how it was launched and how it took a devastating toll on a friendship and, in effect, on a person, but understanding how easily it would have been to completely mess this thing up is something to keep close in mind, and something that will help elevate appreciation for what Fincher (and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin) did here.<br /><br />GREED<br /><br />POWER<br /><br />AMBITION<br /><br />LUST<br /><br />JEALOUSY<br /><br />PASSION<br /><br />FAILURE<br /><br />SUCCESS<br /><br />It's all there, bursting through the surface.yers Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's (former) best friend, is stunningly effective and poignant.

And that score; O.M.G.    Knowing that I really need to start wrapping this up is killing me.  SO MUCH TO SAY SO MUCH TO SAY, but alas, I will try and close this up like so; this movie is far more than you'd expect.  Yes, this a movie about Facebook and how it was launched and how it took a devastating toll on a friendship and, in effect, on a person, but understanding how easily it would have been to completely mess this thing up is something to keep close in mind, and something that will help elevate appreciation for what Fincher (and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin) did here.      GREED    POWER    AMBITION    LUST    JEALOUSY    PASSION    FAILURE    SUCCESS    It's all there, bursting through the surface.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is an amazingly versatile broadcaster. And the price is very reasonable for what you get. I got it because I upgraded to the new iPod nano 6G and my previous broadcaster (Griffin iTrip) would not support the new device. I was hesitant at first because my experience with other broadcasters was that they had poor signal quality, particularly if they relayed on a connection through the iPod's headphone jack. But this broadcaster had NO BROADCAST problems. Amazing clear quality. It works with my iPod nano and my iPad. I tested it with a USB thumbdrive and it worked great, even let me browse files...WOW! You could easily use it as an MP3 player if you only played MP3's in your car. I also hooked it up to my laptop through the audio out port. Again... perfection. I wish I had found this Satechi broadcaster first! I highly recommend it... and I think it will be my car broadcaster of choice for a LONG LONG time!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|lots of dvds, extras , and cool cases.  but amazon did not furfill their 2day shipping and its gonna be here in 5 days instead of 2!  that sux , besides that I love this show and cant wait till season 2 comes out on dvd and it sells for this price. lol
0783230079|5.0|This item arrived in a very timely manner, was in great condition, and mom already enjoyed it as her Christmas present!  Thank you very much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  This was my first taste of fantasy reading and it was delicious.  Absolute must read for anyone looking for a wonderful adventure in the world of fantasy.  Can't wait for the series to hit television! Thanks GRRM!
B00000IQW5|5.0|This product arrived in a very timely fashion, was in great shape also.  I had bought it for my mother as a Christmas gift, but then had found out she already had it.  So I got it for myself!  Always is one of my favorite all time movies.  It has been enjoyed already!  Thank you.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I do not contend to be a movie critic but I thoroughly enjoyed this remake of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" while keeping in mind that I have not seen the original which may distort my view from other reviewers. But I have been a long time fan of myths/fantasy/swordsmanship and I have seen many sword flicks in my day and I was very entertained by this movie.    Yes there are inconsistencies, but if you pick apart every production piece by piece you can't enjoy it for what it is, after all this is entertainment. If you want a Greek Mythology reference for a university/college paper this is probably not for you, but if you are looking for a visually stunning, entertaining movie and are prepared to enjoy I recommend this for you.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Great to see Eminem back on form with his best album since The Eminem Show.    I'd rate the tracks as follows;    1. Cold Wind Blows 9/10 - Despite what others have said, this is a great start to the album. Best since White America kicked off TES.    2. Talkin' 2 Myself ft. Kobe 9/10: Another great song, covers Eminem's jelousy over Lil Wayne and Kanye's success a few years back.    3. On Fire 3/10: Weakest song on the album.    4. Won't Back Down ft. Pink 6/10: OK, but should have been much better. Pink is given little to work with.    5. W.T.P. 8/10: Fun.    6. Going Through Changes 8/10: Very strong.    7. Not Afraid 8/10: Works well as the 1st single of his 'comeback'.    8. Seduction 7/10    9. No Love ft. Lil Wayne 10/10 Features some of Eminem's best flow ever. Unbeatable.    10. Space Bound 10/10: What a way to follow up No Love, with another almost perfect song.    11. Cinderella Man 9/10: On a roll. Great song once again.    12. 25 to Life 8/10    13. So Bad 7/10 - Not the best song but great to finally have a Dre produced song.    14. Almost Famous 8/10    15. Love The Way You Lie ft Rihanna 10/10 - What hasnt been said about this song. Amazing collaboration with Rihanna.    16. You're Never Over 9/10 - Nice tribute to Proof.    17. Untitled (Here We Go) 8/10 - Fun finish to the album.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This series is amazing.  I won't get into any of the story, just simply say it was amazing.    On Blu-Ray the sceens are incredible.  There are lots of night-scenes that show great detail.  The sound quality is also incredible.  I watched this series in two sittings (would have been one but that would have made for a very long night)    If you are a fan of SPR or BOB - than this will be enjoyed.  Loved it.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Very visual and compelling, not what I was expecting but got more than I bargained for - a great movie
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is a great vampire show.  I love the casting of the characters on this show.  I think everyone is perfect in their role.  The writing is good and not cheesy.  I can't wait for season 2 to be out on DVD.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter first at a local bookstore and   returned it to save $6 through Amazon.  Free Shipping also.
B001U891HE|3.0|The formatting and TOC seem relatively good but when you use search this book to find words or phrases a dialogue box pops up to tell you that this item has not yet been indexed and that the search cannot be completed.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|It's rather like dating a pretty girl with no brains: at first, you love spending time with her because she's so good to look at but then you get bored by her because everything she says and does is so horrifyingly, mind-numbingly stupid. Worse, everyone around you is fawning over her because they're enamoured and just don't care.    Avatar is a technologically brilliant steamer of a film. The only conceivable reason why it's so damn popular is because it is so pretty. It breaks new ground in recycling old clichés, it's a breathtaking masterpiece of mixing elements from Dances With Wolves, Small Soldiers, and the Smurfs.    Come to think of it, that's really all it is:  - Take one copy of Dances With Wolves.  - Replace background with weird alien ecosystem.  - Extract Kevin Costner, replace him with a guy who spends half his life in a wheelchair and half as Grouchy Smurf.  - Throw in a tall, curvy Smurfette.  - Mix in a little Generic Army Psycho #7.  - Add endless computer runtime.  - Boil until bland, season with clichés until market testing verifies profitability.    James Cameron has made some of the greatest films I've ever seen. Oh, and he also made Avatar.
B002ZG981E|2.0|A shallow movie which attempts intelligence but falls drastically short. Uninspired, laden with achingly bad dialog that even DiCaprio can't salvage, predictable plot, poor character development, and a finale that made me cringe.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Entertaining, almost as good as being at concert.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|It wouldve been good to see both Arnold schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis take in some action during the movie, but that's okay I guess. Jason Straham and Jet Li two martial art bad asses wow!!!. Randy Courte better look out. Steve Austin is a ruthless S.O.B. Slevester Stalone just get better with age.... \\"THE BOYS ARE COMING TO TOWN\\"
B002ZG99NG|4.0|One of the best action films I seen Ben Affleck in. He's phenomenial in this movie. Straight bad ass from start to finish. It's way better than his leading role in Dare Devil.
0446195529|1.0|I really liked Baldacci's early books and I have read and mostly enjoyed each of his books since then.  But this Camel Club stuff is really worn out now -- Hell's Corner is neither entertaining nor readable.  I invested enough time to get half-way through the book, then decided he is no longer worth reading.  Baldacci should dump the Camel Club and return to what made his earliest books so great.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|This is a good interpretation of the novel, Eclipse, by Stephanie Meyers.  Some purist object to the expansion of the \\"Riley\\" story line but it was aptly explained in the extras why this was necessary for the films. The CGI techniques keep getting better and better.  The wolves are the most obvious examples of the improvement.  The extras are fantastic!  Great explanations of all aspects of making this film. I highly suggest watching them!  All in all, it's a fantastic movie and a great investment!
031603438X|5.0|I never really have been a huge fan of either the Stones or Keith Richards.  My wife bought me this book for my birthday and I was a bit underwhelmed, to say the least.  I gave it a chance, though, and I'm glad I did.  What a fantastic story, told with grit, passion and humor.  I have a newfound respect for Keith and the band, and, despite (or perhaps because of) the tales of drugs, women and back-stabbing, I found this story to be THE consumate rock and roll tale that I've ever read.  By the end of the book, you can't help but feel that you're one of Keith's \\"mates\\".   A fabulous read.....
1410430103|4.0|My husband and I read, and read, and read.  So we have \\"tested\\" many book categories and many authors.  We have just this year discovered Lee Child, and his Jack Reacher series.      After reading his books which were still on the library shelves, we came to Amazon.com to find the beginning, the first two Jack Reacher books, The Killing Floor being the first.    Lee Child is an excellent writer.  His characters are so clearly described, you feel you know them.  His descriptive ability gives your \\"mind's eye\\" distinct \\"pictures\\" of what you are reading.
0553103547|5.0|Really, really, good stuff. I am so glad I found this epic series. I only hope Mr. Martin Finishes soon. I am on the fourth book. It is my understanding he has completed five of seven. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes a dark character driven story. So many great twist and turns. Every chapter leaves me wanting more. I can't wait to see how it ends but I never want to finish.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This is one of the best recordings I've heard in years. I was amazed to read all the other good reviews and had to listen to the cds myself to see if they were true and they were. I didn't know Leonard Cohen was still touring or recording or was still alive. I had first listened to his music in the early 70s and many of the songs I heard then are on these cds. They have stood the test of time. The lyrics and music evoke feelings of emptiness and fullness, often both at the same time. He is a magical poet and musician. His band and singers do a wonderful job of accompanying Cohen in each story he tells. When I am playing these cds, I have found it difficult to do anything else except listen.
1595141715|4.0|In Jay Asher's debut novel, he creates a character so honest and so messed up inside that I could almost see her standing next to me as I read the book- I was convinced that Hannah Baker is real. I don't remember ever reading a book where the teenagers were so real. Teens cheat and lie and hurt (I should know, I am one) and Hannah tells it like it is. After committing suicide, she leaves a series of thirteen tapes to be passed around. They are not so much a suicide note as a reminder to all the people that hurt her; these people are the reasons she killed herself. The narrator, Clay, listens to these tapes and reflects on what could have been. I loved this story. I loved how brutally honest Hannah was, and I loved her ability to make me think about how my actions DO affect other people. We are not all separate entities in this world; what we do has the power to hurt and destroy lives, as Hannah's life was destroyed. The only thing that I found to be slightly disappointing with the book was Clay's reason; it almost seemed as if Hannah let him off easily. All in all, though, this book was a fantastic read and I applaud Jay Asher for revealing to the world what a bitterly disappointing and painful place high school can be.
B0007M4610|5.0|My 2.5 year old is obsessed with Shinkansen trains,so we bought him this train with his new Brio train set for Christmas. Most Brio (and wooden) train engines and cars have 4 non-pivoting wheels, but the Shinkansen cars each have 2 sets of 4 pivoting wheels, which actually makes them a bit more difficult to keep on the track. At first, it was kind of frustrating for my son, but he got the train a week ago,and he's already getting better at it--his motor skills are improving. Just something to keep in mind. But as with all Brio trains, it's exceptionally well made--Brio simply makes the best trains out there.
B001BVRNPW|1.0|To bad the movie on blueray is to grainey. I like the movie but there is so much grain in it that a standerd dvd looks much better.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|The set was in perfect condition and exactly what was described for a GREAT price.  I bought the set as a Christmas gift for my husband and he is excited to watch them all now.  Thank you!
B0017XOF5A|1.0|I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it's another great stargate film.
B000GW8RX4|2.0|The music is good. But, it is hard to watch from the beginning to the end. Ritchie's guitar solos just drone on and on and on ... It was nice to see Ronnie James Dio's 1st ever professionally filmed concert ever.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|After installing a new home theater system (complete with 124\\" projected screen and 5.1 ch surround) I needed some adequate blu-ray titles upon which to test the setup.  In my research I found that Life was consistently recommended by enthusiasts, and so decided to purchase it.<br /><br />Not only was I blown away by the beautiful color and sound, but I found it to be positively the best nature series I have ever seen.  Life goes far beyond the usual nature show lion/zebra chase, in to the closed off and intimate lives of these animals as you've never seen it before.<br /><br />And as a tech junkie, I found the making-of featurettes at the end of each episode very interesting as well.There is also an included picture and sound setup guide which I found extremely helpful, especially for tuning my brightness and contrast, which I had all wrong.  My black levels have never looked better.<br /><br />If you like nature or awesome high-definition color and sound you will not regret this purchase one bit.
030746363X|3.0|The content generally informative in terms of diet and exercise. I even found the author's extreme self experimentation amusing. Most textual instructions on how to do exercises is not helpful. Example, some one will need a certified kettlebell trainer to do the turkish get up properly to avoid injury and not develop bad technic esp for newbies. Even if one watches this particular exercise on video it is still difficult to do. If someone would be interested in the two handed kettlebell swings to firm up the glutes and lose weight it would be helpful to seek out a certified Russian kettlebell trainer and not rush to buy the kettlebells.(Russian kbells are expensive and that does not include the shipping). This author has connections and access to the best trainers and experts. He shows what is available out there. So that may be helpful to those who may need their services.  I am returning this book back to Amazon. The sprinkles of the F* and A* words are also unhelpful.
0316019984|5.0|Amazing book! The detail and complexity of the pop-ups are unlike anything I've ever seen! This is the perfect gift for any fan of DC Comics!    One thing to note, however, is that this book is not a good idea for less-than-responsible children. The pop-ups are so intricate and delicate that I could see them being destroyed pretty easily if the book isn't handled with care. It's that intricacy and detail, though, that make this book so cool.    Highly recommended!!
076115678X|5.0|I wanted to write a review for those who already own the earlier (2001) edition of Massey's book to say that this new, updated version is definitely worth the purchase!  I had been worried that the book would repeat a lot of the information from the previous book, and, while there is some overlap, much of the text is new and the new photos and curl categories are really helpful.  I had also been worried that the book would really promote/push Massey's DevaCurl line of products, but it doesn't at all.  Overall, this new edition includes a lot more information than the original book -- and the DVD that accompanies it is excellent!<br /><br />I just started using the Curly Girl method about 1 1/2 months ago to bring out the wave in my hair, and so far the results have been amazing.  My hair is curlier and looks better than it ever has, and it's nicely moisturized.  I can't wait to see what results I'll get after following the method for a longer period of time!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|The whole gift set is great. I bought it as a gift for someone and he loved it. It really is unique with the replication of Springsteen's old notebook and allows you to see his thought process in the creation of the album. Very unique!
B000BSLU2S|5.0|I bought this after my PS3 experienced symptoms similar to the YLOD.  I tried fixing it once and the thermal paste didn't work long term like I thought it would.<br />So I looked online and found that this was supposed to be the best of the best for Thermal paste.<br />This thermal paste was def. better than the last product I tried.  But to no avail my PS3 only recovered long enough to back up its information to buy a new one.<br />The packaging and actual material appeared to be of better quality and I would recommend it.
1416550550|5.0|Someone loaned me this book and I read it because of the fairy tale connection.  As the fairy tale book was described I was sure it was based on one I'd had as a child and that only made the engrossing story more enjoyable for me.  I loved the female characters and hated it when the book ended.  This was an unusual book for me to read as I normally tend toward gritty mysteries but I'm so glad I read it.
6301404440|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Walt Disney Pictures' and Steven Spielberg's first (and so far only) collaboration \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" First off, it was a good movie; funny and entertaining. BUT did it have to be full of sexual innuendo and strong profanity (one use each of \\"Bastard\\" and \\"S.O.B.\\") which are not associated with Disney? I didn't like Baby Herman in this movie. did he have to be so crass, especially in the scene in the hallway (smacking his sexy mommy on the rear and saying, \\"I got a 50 year-old lust and a three year-old dinky\\")? And what was that gag about prostate & probate? Totally NOT Disney material. GREAT SCOTT!!! What in the Space Time Continuum is Doc Brown doing in this future?!!!  Could have been released as a Disney movie without the innuendo and strong profanity. \\"The Rocketeer\\" should have also been released via Touchstone Pictures, as it had a strong profanity and innuendo. Rated PG, but should have been rated PG-13. Walt Disney himself would be ashamed of this movie.<br /><br />Walt Disney Pictures isn't known for making this type of movie, so thankfully it was released via Touchstone Pictures. Nor is Steven Spielberg known for making junk like this. Former Disney head Michael Eisner was smart to release this under the Touchstone Pictures' banner, but why were Walt Disney Pictures and Steven Spielberg still involved after they read the script? Stick to Disney's classic animated and live-action films, and avoid this hybrid mess of a bad joke for a movie.
1594744475|4.0|As an avid reader of bento blogs and a collector of bento books I was pleased overall with this book. It's bright, attractively laid out and easy to understand. Some of the ingredients are harder to come by if you don't live near an Asian market but overall, the authors do a good job of offering alternatives. If I had a complaint it would be that I wish all of the pictures were clear and crisp. In the interest of focusing on one part of the bento, some of the side dish items are blurred out so you can't see what it looks like. Not a major issue though.
0783227272|5.0|The story of the slave uprising on board La Amistad and its ensuing trial is the subject of Steven Spielberg's<br />\\"Amistad,\\" a gripping drama. As usual, the movie features an all-star cast led by the then-unknown D.H. as Cinque. Excellent movie. Rated R for nudity.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I first watched this movie with my daughter when it was on HBO and I was blown away with how witty, charming and funny it was.  George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Jason Schwartzman are fabulous in their roles within the Fox family.  After multiple DVR viewings I decided we needed to add this to our movie collection.<br /><br />The film is almost more geared towards adults than children with it's dialogue and themes but the furry animals give the children enough to keep their attention.<br /><br />I thought that \\"Up\\" was the runaway best animated film for 2009 but I'm thinking this film is a SOLID runner up.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Download versions are EXCELLENT!  I love that I have a version always on my computer for quick and easy access and copies for the home theater as well as the \\"car theater\\" and the price ($17.99) was just right.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Given as a gift to a Beatles fan that was looking to complete their collection of Beatles albums. They loved it, Highly recommended!<br /><br />.3
0525423273|5.0|I couldn't put it down, finished it in one night, stayed up until 3am.  The story was heartwarming, the relationships believable, and the characters were smart and funny, and real.  Usually stories like this bother me because the characters are so obsessed with petty problems, but I loved how even though Anna didn't like her parents or her life all the time, she understood that there are far worse problems in the world. So I didn't spend the entire novel bothered by how the main character is conceited. Instead, she has wonderful perception, which was nice.  I loved the setting, where everywhere there is amazing food, beautiful architecture, and famous historical landmarks. Although I've been to Paris before, the place just seems so much more magical and wonderful in the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I wish I could live in this world that Stephenie Perkins created forever.  Great read!
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Unlike others I had seen the reviews before seeing the movie and knew it wasn't oriented toward small kids. I also saw it in the theater (in 3D) so I knew what to expect of the DVD in terms of story and the telling. I also have several versions of A Christmas Carol and don't need then all to be the same with only the actors being different. I enjoy the retelling from the classic to the Magoo to this version.    So the reason for the 1 star is for the DVD itself. I have no problems playing DVDs on my Denon DVD-2200, but the first disc I bought would stall and freeze, showing pixels. I returned it and got a replacement. That one was even worse. I've played numerous older and newer DVDs on my player before and after trying to play this DVD. They all played fine this one would not.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|My bad!  I bought this CD based upon a lot of critics rating it as one of the best Americana albums of 2010.  Well, different strokes for different folks.  Had I listened to Ben Birdwell's \\"adult contemporary\\" voice, I never would have touched this crap of an album.  It is bland in every way.  It is formulaic and not worth playing in an elevator, IMO.  Obviously, there are many critics and listeners who DO like this spoon-fed pablum.  So, I will just say, if you have a rock and roll heart, avoid this drivel as if it were the plague.  If this is Americana, then I am not a fan.  To me, this is nothing but slick, pop music, not worthy of my ears.    If you are a fan of BOH, so be it.  You won't find my review worth a spit.  If you prefer creative music, that which breathes life into the listener's ears, buy a CD by The Bridge, Alejandro Escovedo, Cory Chisel, Ike Reilly (his earlier work) or the Old 97's.  Your mileage may vary.
0802130208|1.0|Due to the high praise I think it's a hit or miss and for me it was certainly a miss. I got through half of it which I thought was an accomplishment - it is so boring, pointless and at moments simply strange. I did not find the humor in it; the main character is a loser....that's it!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I am a Gilmore Girls fan. It is the best gift for fans, I enjoy it very much. ¡Buy it now!
0316017922|1.0|... Looks big and exciting/ important but is full of empty calories. At the end you are full but not even close to fulfilled. Read Steven Pinker's spot on review on Mr. Gladwell and his kind (Po Bronson, Jim Collins etc. At least Mr. Bronson and Mr. Collins have some depth - Mr. Gladwell, it seems, is happily devoid of that as well).<br /><br />In general, it is my experience that the sources are much better than the \\"interpreters\\" of the sources. I would rather read a \\"Nudge\\" - written by people who are actually doing the research on behavioral psychology or analysis of one aspect or the other related to human behavior and their outcomes, whether I agree with it or not, rather than this useless drivel.<br /><br />Here is a list I would recommend on similar topics:<br />1) Anything written by Charlie Munger, but especially anything on the power of incentives<br />2) Influence<br />3) Nudge<br />4) Advice for a young investigator<br />5) Surely you are joking, Mr. Feynman and What do you care what other people think<br />6) Anything written by Atul Gawande<br />7) ...

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|My boys, ages 8 and 10, received this game for Christmas and we have been playing every night since.  This is the best family game I have played for several reasons:    1.  It really makes you (and the other players) think creatively.  If you were to tell me a week ago I'd be able to make the Taj Mahal out of 12 peices of Lego's I would have said you were crazy, but I did it and the kids even guessed what it was!    2.  What a great way to teach problem solving.  Yes, there aren't as many blocks as most people would like, but that is part of the challenge.  Using the variety given and the colors given only make it more fun.    3.  We do nothing but laugh when we play this game.  I admit, I probably love it almost more than the kids!    Do not hesitate in buying this game for your family, it is so much fun!
1439177783|5.0|I found it hard to put this book down, even before the Summer ( in Australia ) holidays started. Well written, honest, touching, & frank.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This is a must own set for Action movie fans.  The Bourne series of movies never looked or sounded better.
B00000583F|4.0|Sleep's Holy Mountain captures this trio at their most powerful & melodic stage.  I was lucky enough to see them open for Nik Turner in Feb 1994, and this disk really captures the potency of their performances.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Love it or hate it, you can't deny the fact that this 2 LP set from Yes is a lot diversified and probably their best album. On that album, you find moments where the music is heavy and intense, a lot of classical guitar, great lyrics, you have for more than 80 minutes of pure magic!!!    This album set up the standard for the next progressive music generation, Yes never done that kind of album before and after that one, and it was an important concept album for them. They were exploring, trying to find new sounds and a new way to write music ... it was a very spiritual process for them, especially for Jon and Steeve...    I'm not surprise that some groups like Genesis with their best album call \\"The lamb lies down on broadway\\" or Pink Floyd with \\"The wall\\" never hesitated to put on the market concept albums!!! Yes set the path to those monster concept albums!    The previously remastered version from Atlantic, remastered by Joe Gastwirt, was not taken from the first generation master tapes OR it was not well remastered cause the sound have a lot more of tape hiss and is a lot noisy, especially in the quiet moments. Since \\"Tales\\" is an album with a lot of quiet moments, the tape hiss or the lack of noise reduction was a way to obvious!    The \\"Rhino remasters\\" of \\"Tales from topographic oceans\\" is by far the best version of this CD so far. The sound is clearer, you can hear instruments and sound that you never heard before on the LP or the old CD. The tape hiss and noise are quite low, who make me think that this 2 CD set is really remastered from the first generation master tapes.    The Rhino remasters are overall better than all the old remastered version made by Joe Gastwirt. They are the ones to get!!!    Too bad that Rhino didn't do a 5.1 mix and a dolby version and put it on a DVD as a bonus. The 2 bonus song are just studio run-through and I don't really care about them.     By the way, the redesigned booklet and the digipak/slipcase is very welcome!!! A GREAT job, I think it's the first time i'm so please with a remasterd CD from the Rhino catalog... The CD's don't get scratch, the restored LP art is perfect, the archival photos are ok but not very interresting and the new liner notes explain a lot of interresting things who happen while the group was rehearsing, writing and recording the album.
B0000009SY|4.0|In the wake of \\"Sheik Yerbouti,\\" the Zapper hit us with Act I of this controversial recording we know as \\"Joe's Garage,\\" and a few months later, we got Acts II and III, as releasing all three acts at once would have priced it out of the market. But fortunately today,  it's all available at once, and it is a quite impressive recording, near perfect, if only...<br /><br />It starts on a good note, upbeat and highly enjoyable, a good mix of serious music and some comedy thrown in, but the listener is then subjected to what I call the music version of soft porn; the character, named \\"Joe (as portrayed by Ike Willis) gets into trouble with the law and is betrayed by the groupie, named \\"Mary\\" (portrayed delightfully by Dale Bozzio; you gotta love her), where he has a tryst with some other woman resulting in a bad case of venereal disease. This particular bit is a textbook case of the Frank Zappa dichotomy: The music to such tracks as \\"Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?\\" is dramatic and powerful, but the lyrics are just what one would expect from seeing the title. Such puerile lyric content, and such spectacular music thrown together has a strange effect; instrumentally, it holds up against anything out there, but the lyrics come off as something a drunk 18-year-old would write. Very strange.<br /><br />And speaking of strange, after Joe gives all his money to \\"The First Church Of Appliantology,\\" he has a series of sexual encounters with a \\"modified Gay Bob\\" doll, shorting it out in an act of depravity. Although I'm no prude, this stuff just pushes the envelope; after Joe is sent to prison, more depravity ensues, as lonely men in prison, short of conjugals, can only be gratified by hand, mouth, or buttock, and the story just derails. But, as Zappa has said over the years, he used lyrics to make his music more listenable. Like I said, this is very good music, with very good singing, and really great sound quality (this release's strongest trait), but the storyline degenerates into a shambles. On a positive note, the more gratuitous material does have a good, humorous feel to it, it's just unlikely to ever be played on a broadcast. But Frank's fan base has accepted this side of his material as part of his whole body of work.<br /><br />The set's penultimate number, the silly-titled, serious instrumental \\"Watermelon In Easter Hay\\" is Frank playing possibly his most expressive guitar solo, just beautiful, the opening and closing themes (I think are played by Warren Cuccurulo) sounding like Carlos Santana, and the whole body of the number just Frank letting his guitar speak. He is at his finest here, and the set closes with \\"A Little Green Rosetta,\\" a sing-along two chord vamp with lots of ad-libbing, a do-as-you-feel number with a party atmosphere.<br /><br />Get this for the music, and try to look past the content.a positive note, the more gratuitous material does have a good, humorous feel to it, it's just unlikely to ever be played on a broadcast.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought this cable in conjunction with an LG Blu Ray player. I was skeptic due to the low price of this cable compared to similar cables at retail stores. It turns out this cable works perfectly, great audio and video. I'm so glad I didn't spring for a more expensive cable. I'm using it to connect the LG Blu Ray player to a 32\\" 720p LCD HDTV.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I purchased the H4N based on the lengthy reviews and reports.  But not for recording music.  I needed to record the sounds of nature and especially Steam train sounds to marry up with the video I take.<br /><br />The H4N does a great job.  Nuff said on that as there are very good reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />Suggestion for buyers:  Amazon, and others, recommend you also purchase SKB Custom Fit Waterproof Equipment Case for Zoom H4N at $59.95.  It's over kill. While this is a tough case, and the H4N does need a case to carry the unit and accessories, it's only necessary if you are traveling to humid, rainy, mud laden jungles and plan to drive over the H4N with a vehicle.<br /><br />A better case for most of us is Caselogic's TBC-305 Camcorder Case $18.00 (Amazon) and a perfect fit with the extras.<br /><br />July 2013 Update:  Have been using this unit off and on for a couple of years.  Doing a great job.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|I read Dickens' A Christmas Carol over the holiday.  It was free to download on Kindle. Sadly, I don't believe I've ever read it before.  I remember Great Expectations from high school (also free on Kindle), but honestly don't ever remember reading A Christmas Carol.  It's another one of those classics I blame my teachers for cheating me on back when I should have been reading it, but a small town high school curriculum spent too much time on Shakespeare instead.<br /><br />All of us know the story.  It's Christmas tradition, right?  If you tried, you could probably tell a decent version of it out loud to the children at your Christmas party and do a pretty good job at it. First published in 1843, it's been a part of our American lives for a long time. Like I said before, it's tradition.  Most of us know it from the big screen. If not the 1951 black and white version (also available colorized), you definitely saw the 1984 version with George C. Scott. The Muppets did it. Even Bill Murray spoofed it in 1988, a good spoof which is a classic in itself from the 80s.<br /><br />Community theatre groups have also embraced it and made it tradition on the stage.  I was almost in a musical version myself back in high school, but it got canceled for some reason.  I was cast in dual roles, one that I don't remember, but I was also going to be the Ghost of Christmas Future and I remember the director obsessing over how I should point. When I lived in Memphis, I went to see the annual production of it at Theatre Memphis. My point is, and I do have one, is how many of us can honestly say we first learned the timeless tale from the book itself.  I know I didn't.<br /><br />It's like a really good memory that we embellish year after year for whatever reason, until sooner or later we forget how it actually happened. We're so numb to it.  We've received more pleasure telling it our way, so why rediscover how it actually began, how it actually went, or what the truth is.<br /><br />That's exactly why I wanted to read it. It's there.  Scrooge. Marley. Tiny Tim. The ghosts. All there. As I read, my brain played it out just like seeing it on the big screen, even some of the dialogue (including \\"God bless us, everyone!\\") was right there on the page. So, what does this tell us?  Throughout history, we haven't changed it much.  We've at least stayed true to it, not counting the Bill Murray version of course. I tried - very hard - not to picture versions of the characters I knew from the movies.<br /><br />Honestly, it's not very good writing in most places.  Dickens loves to list things in order to describe them, like opening the thesaurus searching for a better word and deciding to just use them all.  Case in point, when the Ghost of Christmas Present arrives he is sitting on a throne made from food.  Dickens names almost every food there is.  I'm paraphrasing here but it was a throne of ham, sausage, turkey, chicken, grapes, apples, bananas, oranges, pies, custards, puddings, bread, muffins, cakes, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, M&Ms, Yoplait Yogurt, Froot Loops, Candy Bars.... and this isn't the only place he does it.  The children were happy, glad, gleeful, joyful, cheerful... bleggh! Some of the lists take up half a page or more!<br /><br />It was kind of like reading Shakespeare for the first time, be it Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet or whatever you read in high school, and your getting it.  You are comprehending it okay, enough to know what it's about.  But your really having to dig through the muck to find the parts that make sense.  But overall, in the end, it does make sense. You found yourself scheming through it or focusing your attention elsewhere during parts, at least until you got to something you could understand.  I didn't scheme through any of Christmas Carol - I read every damn word of it - but believe me, there were parts where I found myself slowly drifting off and thinking about something else.<br /><br />In the end, I felt no different than when I did before I read it.  A sense of accomplishment?  Perhaps.  Now I can at least say I've read it.  I know the truth, although everything I knew before wasn't much different.  I want to question what makes this a classic, but I already know the answer.<br /><br />Time.<br /><br />So...I don't have much more to say about it.  God bless us everyone!shment?  Perhaps.  Now I can at least say I've read it.  I know the truth, although everything I knew before wasn't much different.  I want to question what makes this a classic, but I already know the answer.    Time.    So...I don't have much more to say about it.  God bless us everyone!
B0043ZDU1E|3.0|First of all, let me clarify my rating. Standing on its own, Loreena McKennitt's latest relese would warrant a \\"5\\" from me. Compared to her other works that were strongly influenced by Celtic music, particulary \\"The Visit,\\" \\"The Book of Secrets,\\" and \\"The Mask and the Mirror,\\" \\"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\\" pales.    Her interpretations of the traditional music that she includes are top-notch. So are her original compositions which are superb. Her rendering of \\"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\\" is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard, deeply felt and mournful. The weakest track, in my opinion, is \\"Down By the Sally Gardens\\" which is sung in her extreme high range to an extent that it's hard for me to listen to, obscuring the beauty of the music. McKennitt's songs in which she uses her entire impressive range are much more compelling.    McKennitt's previous albums included liner notes, including lyrics. This one does not. The biggest loss is that of the lyrics, which is one of the reasons I've rated this outing lower. Loreena has never been a good enunciator, many of her words getting lost in the music or mushing together. I've captured the beauty of her lyrics, only by reading them, then applying them when I listened to the songs.    If you're a fan of Loreena McKennitt, by all means purchase this album. If you're new to her music, this is a great place to start -- then move on to some of her earlier works.

B001SS3JS8|5.0|I think this book was one that could bring out many emotions while reading it. This book is one of my favorite books that I have read. I highly disagree with all the 1 stars because this book is what really happens in life. This is a book that I did not want to put down because I wanted to know the ending more than anything.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|\\"Little Women\\" is so well written and accessible. I had only seen the movie before reading the book, and as with most all stories, the book is by far better. I felt as if I were a silent member of the March family. I laughed at Jo's antics, and cried at Beth's departure. I really think this book has encouraged me to be a genuinely better person. I feel challenged to hold my tongue and have patience and to show kindness. This is definitely a must read for everyone!
B002ZG9940|5.0|It's easy to hate \\"The American\\". Anton Corbijn's film is deliberately slow, its narrative is mostly inward and it's chock full of complex character development. (It also doesn't help that the film was marketed as a high octane thriller when it's, quite literally, the exact opposite.) For me, though, all the things I listed above are right up my ally for what I look for in a film. I really embraced this film and what it had to offer. The plot, while familiar, is still complex and rewarding and memorable. George Clooney is wonderful here, dragging the viewer into his own personal hell. The pace and the way the story is told is certainly something that would have been at home in the spy films of the 1970s. The picture is also extremely stylish and endlessly beautiful. \\"The American\\" is one of the more difficult, mainstream films of 2010 and many viewers were totally lost by it. I, on the other hand, loved this complex little movie. I was taken in by it's soulful approach.

B004FEWYXS|4.0|Try to get past all the controversy and opinions.  The very first album I ever purchased was the Jackson Five's Dancing Machine.  Four decades later, I'm still buying a Jackson product.  In everything I have read or seen, Michael understood that his talent was a gift.  As a teacher, Michael continues to share his gift with children and adults.  \\"My favorite singer is Michael Jackson!\\" This is often a quote I here from quite a few students.  This album will not disappoint MJ fans.  The only major negative is that the CD only has 10 songs.  However, this cd does get me energized during my 24 mile morning commute!  Michael Jackson music is the perfect way to avoid dozing off during a long drive.  Michael's music has probably saved me from sleeping behind the wheel during long road trips in the middle of the night several times.  I'm just glad I have more music from Michael to enjoy. Just remember, Michael's so-called average work is still better than most of the artists out in the pop scene today.

6305428352|5.0|The first time I've seen this was on tv, and I fell in love with this movie.    Nowadays you can rarely find a movie as deep as this one, it is not about being famous, it is not about money, it is not about love, it is not about wars, not about visual effects, but its a movie about passion, a man's passion in music, on the other hand, it is also about being realistic, though he has a great passion in music, he also has to consider his family, so he becomes a teacher in high school.    If you like deep and touching movies, this is it.
B002JE43O4|5.0|My entire family really enjoyed this television series. It was so interesting that we couldn't wait to see every episode. We bought the entire series so we could view each episode when it was convenient for us. I was surprised at the plot and the in depth story of each character. It was mesmerizing to all of us. The cast was very good and so were the enemy.  This story had a strange twist but you will not find out until the end.   I loved the ending--it was very inspiring. I hope you will enjoy this as much as we did.
0756656230|3.0|While this book has some great history about The Lego Company and how it started, it also feels very incomplete and almost thrown together. Visually it is an impressive work however each section contains only a few sets and some of the info provided is inaccurate. It would be great to open a book like this and see ALL the sets from a specific line instead of only a few that were deemed \\"worthy\\". All in all it's an enjoyable read but if you're a true Lego fan it will leave you feeling a bit disappointed and wanting more.
B004E3XD1W|4.0|I did truly enjoy this story. It was an easy read, but not overly simplified. There was a decent amount of depth to the two main characters and the storyline flowed smoothly.     Yet.. I felt that there were several peripheral characters that could (if not should) have been more developed. First and foremost: Randa. In many ways, he's the initial guiding hand to who and what Katsa is.. yet we know very little about him. Also: Oll, Giddon, Raffin, and even Bann.    Lastly, the ending.. oh.. how tragic the ending. After such a wonderful story.. it just stops. It's such a completely anticlimactic end to a great tale. I wasn't expecting buckets of blood or a marriage (especially not the latter).. but something -more-. I came to care for these characters and feel that they were unjustly cut short. I love cliff hangers, endings that make you wonder at the possibilities, but the finish to this book seemed as if Ms. Cashore was a) rushed to finish, b) burned out, c) unsure how the story should end.     I have one last, lingering hope for the story.. and that is the fact that Ms. Cashore hints at another novel to follow from Penguin.

B004856SQ8|5.0|If ever I was wrong about a movie (So much for first impressions) it's The A team. Tops my list of surprise hits of the year. This was one fun movie to watch whether you remember the TV show or not. The casting was spot on. Liam Neeson made a perfect Hannibal Smith as were the other members of the team. It was nice to notice members of the TV show's production team were involved in the making of the movie.  Here's hoping there will be a sequel!

1844137872|5.0|Not only is the current generation of street artists mostly brilliant but Banksy, in particular, possesses a type of rare genius. He challenges authority with wit and intelligence.  And, baby, can he draw.  It is always impressive to find an artist who not only has something to say, but who says it in a new, unique and deliciously indignant way.  Thank you, Banksy, for offering up a wonderful amalgam of some of your best, and for sharing it with the public... even if it is now sitting on a coffee table in a suburban home.  I think Banksy must enjoy the irony of it all.
0800141660|2.0|Don't get this version.  Get the 2008 BBC version.  This version was poorly cast and lacked chemistry.  Except for Alan Rickman who was actually pretty great as Colonel Brandon.  The rest though, not so much.  Especially Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant who had zero chemistry as Elinor and Edward.  Emma Thompson was actually pretty bland.  The 2008 BBC version has everything this one lacked.
B000JQUZCI|1.0|I write reviews for my blog [[ASIN:B00427Z25K Ruminations from an Unkempt Mind]], and did so for this book a few months ago.  I realized that I had never put my opinion out there for non-subscribers.  So, here's a little of what I said for the blog.<br /><br />I love horror fiction, especially classic horror fiction.  I love female authors.  I love people who are unconventional and who color outside the lines, as Shelley did simply by writing this novel.  I should love this book.<br /><br />I don't.<br /><br />Let me clarify a point right up front:  I was not expecting this book to be anything like any of the many film representations of the story.  I remember that much from college.  I knew up front that this book would not be anything like the movies (although had it been like \\"Young Frankenstein\\" I'd have married this book).<br /><br />What I was expecting was a thrilling horror novel with most of the suspense being internal in Victor Frankenstein.  What I got was a snooze-fest.  The novel is presented in epistle form, and I typically love epistles (there's a phrase you don't hear every day).  \\"The Color Purple\\" is one such example.  Frankenstein is not.  The \\"internal suspense\\" in this novel is really more Dr. Frankenstein being a whiny little girl.  He spends all of his time lamenting his mistakes but not doing anything about them until you are about 80% through the novel.<br /><br />I'm not saying that I hated the entire book.  I just hated the first 40%.  That first 40% consists of the exposition, which is ridiculously long, and Dr. Frankenstein relating his story to the letter writer.  This is really dry because, as I stated before, Frankenstein is a whiny little girl.  At the 40% point, the novel picks up.  It actually becomes entertaining.  \\"Did Dr. Frankenstein stop whining?\\" you ask.  Nope.  This is when the Creature speaks (that's right, in the book, the Creature speaks).  From the moment that the Creature speaks (quite eloquently I might add) until he stops telling his tale, the book is absolutely riveting.  I call him the Creature because in the novel he is never named and whether or not he is actually a monster is for the reader to decide.  That's actually one of the themes of the book.  I won't reveal whether or not I think that he's a monster.  I'll let you decide that for yourself, should you choose to read it.<br /><br />Just be prepared to be bored for somewhere around 1120 locations.  Don't say I didn't warn you.olutely riveting.

B0042JIL2E|4.0|I first heard Imelda May on the Jeff Beck album, Emotion & Commotion. That led me to download Love Tattoo from Itunes. Just loved it. Been following Imelda on the 'net, and enjoying videos of her live performances on You Tube. I was very frustrated that Mayhem was not available in the US months after its UK release.    At any rate when I finally received this CD from Amazon, I had heard \\"I'd go with a Psycho\\" and \\"Mayhem\\" via the official music videos on You Tube. I liked both of those but was worried that Imelda and her boys were getting stuck on one type of their many styles. After listening to Mayhem the first time, I felt a bit like it was just \\"Love Tattoo\\" all over again. However, after subsequent listenings I find that my view of the album has gone up consistently.    Her voice remains a wonderful instrument and her songwriting continues to amaze in its variety and heart felt sincerity. The band is so tight and the instrumentation is very creative.  Just great music!
B003N6DB2C|5.0|This band is one of the best thing to happen in 2010 for Black Metal/Heavy Metal.    Kvelertak (strangle-hold) just keeps growing on you the more times you play it. Their concerts are amazing and I really encourage you to catch them live - they have been touring in Europe in 2010 and I hope they come to the States next year.    This is not depressive and dark metal but rather - vivacious, lets party and drink lots of Mjød on a Friday night kind of music :) Their lyrics are about Norse mythology and the music really puts you in a good mood.     The singer sings in his native Norwegian and with such an intensity that it just blows your mind.    Give these guys a listen you will not regret it!

B001RTSPVY|4.0|Season 1 of Breaking Bad was outstanding, and for much of this season, the same can be said.  Character development is improved, and this is especially beneficial for Jessie and Hank--these two are no longer the one note stereotypes the series started them out with.  Jessie, a hyperactive annoyance with a lack of brain power in Season 1, expands his emotional range and depth in Season 2, and Hank, who was a Vic Mackey clone with very little gray area in Breaking Bad 1.0, now has some extra layers, as well as an expanded (and highly entertaining) DEA plot arc.    What else is improved?  Overall creativity in the film-making.  From ominous flash forwards, trippy montages cued to expertly chosen music, some incredible cold opens (including a music video), and excellent use fast-motion fixed camera shots, the show has become the best made, most unique-looking experience on television.  Furthermore, it boasts one of the great all-time episodes: \\"4 Days Out,\\" which is a standalone pressure-cooker and my personal favorite so far.    So with all this praise, what goes wrong?  For most viewers, the consensus appears to be nothing, but I believe there were some significant missteps.  Without revealing too many SPOILERS, the following issues were significant enough to drop the rating down one star:    1.) In the last quarter of the season, the meth-making angle takes a long hiatus, and the show suffers from a lack of criminal tension (which has previously fueled much of the suspense and success of Breaking Bad as a whole).  2.) Jessie's girlfriend is a bit of a cliched plot device--existing as a surrogate tension-maker for the evaporating drug dealing angle--without her, Walt and Jessie wouldn't have any new conflicts.  She essentially becomes a \\"Wormtongue\\" and is drawn in fairly broad strokes.  3.) The ominous flash forwards.  Were they executed well?  Absolutely.  Was I dying to see what they actually pertained to in the finale?  For sure.  Was there a pay off?  In my opinion, while the unveiling was clever, I do not believe the entire season should surround and build up to such a purely metaphorical (but from a plot standpoint unimportant) moment in time.    Regardless of my personal opinion of the last quarter of the season, the show as a whole, the style of film making, and the addictive (meth like?) quality of the episodes make this my favorite diversion on television.  I may be critical of some small areas of development, but Breaking Bad is top notch.

It's been noted that the part of Winston Churchill was weak, yet, if a  stronger characterization had been issued it might have overstepped its purpose and overshadowed the others..I think it was fine..doesn't really matter.  Go and see this film on the big screen now while playing.  It will win the academy award.  Can't wait to own this film.  What a treasure!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|My introduction to Leonard Cohen came in a freshman English class.  Forty years later, late on a Saturday night alone at home, I stumbled across the \\"Live in London\\" show on PBS, and for nearly two hours I laughed, cried, and relived the brightest and darkest hours of my life.  Like a holyman or shaman, the gravel voice invoked obscure memories and explosive emotions about love, politics, loss, love, humor...  The lyrics, unlike any other artist that I know of, were powerful in themselves.  Growing old, experiencing the changes of body and social mores, dancing at last call, the lost love, lost innocence, lost years.  He speaks truth at a subliminal level.  But the musical arrangements, with reed instruments from harmonica to saxophone, strings from lute-like Eastern European instruments (and of course guitars), keyboards, delicate percussion, all woven and intertwined into a delicate blend that could stand alone.  Sharon Robinson, the beautiful face and voice that has been the unsung heroine of Cohen's career, would be a star in her own right in any other ensemble.  And the harmonies that backed up the rumbling voice were nearly orgasmic at times.  Really.    No Pop here, no fluff, but sweet and wonderful music that forces you to think, and to feel.  If you like some brain in your music, this album will fulfill you at all of the levels of musical and meaningful emotion.  Buy it, borrow it, steal it, and then set aside time to absorb it in an uninterrupted setting.  When you listen, you will understand.
B0035G1K7S|5.0|I was glued to the screen from beginning to end and then had to watch this two more times the same week that I bought it.  Excellent film quality, great artistry, and wonderful insights into the workings of the band.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This Movie is great, always loved it and when raising my kids I used to play it on Thanksgiving morning for them keeping with the Parade by Macy's Department Store going on in the beginning of it. They came to love it as a Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Tradition and I just found out by way of the very same DVD purchased that a day is set aside for viewing the film in Ireland, very similar to the family tradition I had with my kids when growing up..<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD set, one Original Black and White and one Colorized for anyone that dislikes black and white, not to mention the different added attractions and information added by interviews, inside information etc.<br /><br />I might add myself that the house used at the end of the film really exists on Long Island's North Shore on what I recall to be \\"24 Derby Road\\" Port Washington New York. That is in Nassau County North of Northern Boulevard not far from the Queens County/Nassau County border line.<br /><br />It is a nice neighborhood still to this day remains very much as it was then during the movie shoot and note in the DVD extras a lot of detail is added on neighbors and their interactions with the actors, actresses and crew making the movie.<br /><br />It arrived on time, in good condition was everything represented by the vendor and will forever remain a cherished part of my movie collection.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This movie was delivered fast and the description of it was accurate.  The DVD worked well and was in good condition.
B000QXDED6|5.0|This is of course a reenactment of an actual event in history however a bit over done in special effects to suit my taste but all in all an excellent film.    True stories are what I enjoy most, dramas or reenactments or even documentary type presentations appeal to me most.    The product was as advertised, sent quickly and received just as quickly, in good condition and in the condition the vendor claimed in their advertisement.
0307454541|1.0|I read any and all books,... when i saw all the reviews for this book i automatically picked it up thinking it would be a blockbuster hit, considering all the hype... WOW was i wrong. I should have put it down after realizing it had took me more then 3 days just to finish the first 40 pages of the book. Very boring book, cant understand how it was a big hit...
B000683VI4|5.0|This is an excellent film, the way it introduces one in the beginning and the way it takes you through the young lives of the main characters prior to the days of visits and conversations.    The purcahse was priced right, sent and received quickly and in good condition, one of my all time favorites about life and love.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I adore the starring actors, lovely Jennifer Connelly and the enigmatic David Bowie. This is a fantasy story about the transition from childhood to adult. There is the rebellion and resistance this rite of passage. The thoughtless, impulsive desires blurted without thought to consequence. The ultimate realization of accountability. The acceptance of the tasks at hand to make right what was wronged. I think this is a fine fairy tale with a great soundtrack!<br />I am confident (and hopeful) my son will enjoy as well.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|A true story with many personal details added for effect, well done and a master piece from Mel Gibson that in my opinion has not been matched with a nice sound track also which I saw fit to buy right after viewing the film when it first was Released, purchased the DVD to view it at will and because the VHS is wearing out and this one was termed, \\"Collector's Edition\\" and I thought it would have more in it than the VHS and I was right, it has the additional bits of information most dvd's have these days, facts of interest to most that view the films and enjoy them.    The price was right, the delivery was fast and I had it in house in a very short period of time, the disc played fine and I am totally satisfied with this purchase.
B003V6L94Q|3.0|I love The Zac Brown Band, I really do.  The Foundation will probably stay in my iPod forever.  My first impression after three listens to this album is that it's inferior to The Foundation on most counts.  First, I'm not sure it shows any growth in the band.  Sure, the collaborations with Jimmy Buffett and Alan Jackson are cute, but they're not really doing the album any favors.  This album is what I'd classify as \\"Beach Country\\" a la Kenny Chesney.  The Foundation had \\"Toes,\\" the wistful song of aquatic bliss, but this album seems to talk about water, waves, sand, and ocean breezes on every other track.  It makes total sense that Jimmy Buffett collaborated on this album because it's basically a Jimmy Buffett album with a slight Zac Brown twist.  It's almost as though the band got less mature with this album, especially when you consider that there's a line with the phrase \\"lick my sack\\" in it.  I'm not offended by this, just disappointed.  However if I were a 20 year old fraternity boy, that would be right up my post-adolescent-aggression alley.  And that seems to be the audience Zac is gravitating toward.  \\"Martin,\\" the song about a guitar is PAINFULLY cheesy.  Brad Paisley can get away with that stuff, but not Zac Brown.    It's like Zac's record label, or some accomplished \\"artist\\" like Alan Jackson told Zac, \\"you've made it big, now have fun and do what you want on the next album.  You can do no wrong at this point.\\"  And Zac took that tragic advice to heart.    The highlights are \\"Cold Hearted\\" and \\"Colder Weather\\" (great song).  If you liked The Foundation but hated \\"Sic' Em on a Chicken,\\" you'll like these.  \\"No Hurry\\" isn't bad either.  The album gets three stars for these three songs, and because I expect that one or two more songs will grow on me.    But where is Zac going to go from here?  Steel drums and Ziggy Marley guest appearances?

B002ZG981E|5.0|When i first saw Inception i thought it was a good movie, but nothing incredible. After watching it a second time, i realize the first time around i just didn't understand everything that happened. Watching it a second time i was blown away. There is just too much that goes on that a second viewing is a must. The best part about it is it's ORIGINAL - people may not think it's the greatest movie but that's what makes it great. It's one thing to have a great movie from a great book, or re-make, or true story..but to come up with such a complex storyline and translate it to a movie such as this is incredible. It's one of my favorite movies.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|Although this comes from the make of one of my favorite toys, lego, the directions are vague and the kids lost interest with-in minutes and just built things. I was very disappointed. I'm thinking about returning it.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Why does Harry Potter have to grow up??? This is a wonderful film, the 6th in the series of Harry Potter films. It is well made, and keeps you engaged throughout the entire film.
0312600844|5.0|I read for entertainment.  I read for escape.  And so with those requirements in mind, I can say this book was highly entertaining, thought provoking and kept me up til the wee hours reading.  I can appreciate that it might not be for everybodys tastes, but I highly enjoyed it
B000V5TV22|5.0|This is an excellent GPS that works using your lap-top.  Far more accurate than the popular dash top gizmos plus has a lot more bells and whistles at half the price. We use it on the road both for business and RVing.  With the air card, we even have live tracking for the folks back home interested in knowing where we are on our vacations.
037582913X|5.0|In a lot of ways, this is one of the most disturbing books for children ever written. First, as other reviewers have said, as even the title says, there is a monster at the end of this book.<br />Grover, who is one of my favorite Muppets, finds out there is a monster at the end of the story, and justifiably, does not want to go there.<br />The story unfolds, as he begs, pleads and does everything in his sweet illustrated power to stop you from turning the page.<br />Lesson 1.- Adults don't listen to avatars of children or children. Because as much as he begs, they keep turning the pages to read the stories to their young ones. Maybe their young ones want them to completely disregard the strong feelings of lovable Grover to get to the end, maybe they don't. But it is with an illuminating callous disregard for feelings that anyone continues to read this story.<br /><br />The other lessons need to be learned in the reading. But I suspect that most readers miss the subtlety of one lesson. That at the end of the book, there is the monster, and you who read the book. Who's really the monster?<br />As a look at free will, personal responsibility and how the id can easily convince the superego it's doing the right thing because it's what the reader wants to do, it's a more important book than it's given credit for being.<br />Recommended as a start in learning about Objectivism.
0385338910|5.0|I just can't say enough about this author.  I love everything he writes and this one is right up there with all his other works.
067144901X|5.0|My 14 month old loves this book, it has turned out to be one of his favorites over time. I think it's because he enjoys the silly way my husband and I will make the animal sounds in the book. His favorite page is the page with the cats on it, and his first word after Mama and Dada has turned out to be \\"meow!\\" This book is a great size for little hands. I am almost a little surprised just how much baby loves to bring this book to us to read to him, but he has tons of books on his book shelf and this is one of the few that he reaches for on a daily basis.
0061537969|5.0|I have yet to read this book, but on the recomendation of a friend gave it to all of my children for Christmas.
B000AS4L16|1.0|I have seen Shoah soon after its first release and I consider this film to be a staged attempt at shifting the focus from German atrocities during the war to the so called Polish anti-Semitism. Proverbial toothless Polish peasants serve perfectly this purpose, being used as a living proof and turned into a spectacle by the director. Staged questions through a translator, containing hidden meaning and taken out of context, and answers demonstrating how cruelly were these people steered into the trap of double meaning, are not a reliable document to me. I strongly recommend, to all those interested in this subject, viewing the original footage from the war and occupation of Poland, available in Polish archives. They show without commentary the reality of that time.     The film's images associate Polish victims of the war with perpetrators leading to the impression that Poles were either active and willing participants or at the least indifferent bystanders in this tragedy. While certain aspects of the war should be very clear to most of the educated viewers, particularly that the perpetrators were Germans, the film seems to be twisting this clear notion into a biased interpretation that is simply wrong.       Remembering the Holocaust was meant to serve a particular purpose: it meant to assure that this type of genocide never happens again. However, the process of remembering morphed over the decades into the Judeocentric theme, almost unrelated to any other group of victims and thus it lost its original focus. If there is to be any benefit from remembering even the most horrific times in history, there has to be deep understanding of suffering in the humanitarian terms and not only in national or ethic ones. If we are to remember the WWII it has to be done without monopolizing history and without revisionist sensationalisations of those times. In this sense the film that claims to be a historic document fails the viewers.
0061989142|4.0|Even though I got this book for my 16 yr. old daughter, I read it cover to cover and enjoyed it. Not sure there is tons of \\"new\\" information, but if you love Lauren's style, this book will help you pull it off. Great makeup tips, and she shows how to mix expensive pieces with less expensive pieces of clothing for a unique look. She dresses tastefully and beautifully, always age appropriate...I would love for my daughter to give her wardrobe and \\"look\\" such thought.    The photography is beautiful and top-notch. You really see the clothes and styles up close without a lot of other stuff to take away from what she's trying to convey. Great book...worth the price for sure!
076115678X|4.0|I received this book yesterday in the mail and I was really excited!  I came across the naturallycurly.com website a few weeks ago and someone in one of the forums mentioned Massey's book and products so I came to amazon.com to read the reviews about the book.  I think I \\"cheated\\" a little and maybe read too many of the reviews or looked at too many of the forums because I got so excited about the techniques and products that I ended up buying some of the devacurl products from Beauty Brands and trying the techniques from the naturallycurly website before the book even arrived.    I guess it's not really considered \\"cheating\\", but by the time the book came and I read through it, I realized that I had already read most of the advice and techniques for my hair type.  The book is still a really great reference to have and I really enjoy the \\"confessions\\" of other curly haired girls.    I've gone in phases in my life where I try to embrace my curls and phases where I just want to look \\"normal\\".  I liked how Massey quoted what was said about curly haired girls on the Bravo show \\"Millionaire Matchmatcher\\" (I watch that show and Patty always tells the girls on it to straighten their hair for their dates).  I, too, have always thought men liked straight haired girls better.  And honestly, my perceived experience was that men would give me more attention when my hair was straight.  What I'm realizing now is that I didn't know how to bring out my curls without frizz or how to take care of my curly hair that when I did wear it curly, not only did I feel ugly (therefore giving off more insecurity), my hair actually looked unruly and ugly.      In the few short weeks that I've followed some of the techniques (no pooing, plopping, diffusing), my hair is so beautiful.  I thought my hair was just wavy and now I've realized that I actually have defined botacelli curls!  I love how they say that taking care of curly hair is like taking care of a cashmere sweater.  I used to be the queen of buns and braids, but now I let my hair free and it actually feels soft, even at the ends.  Though I only used to straighten my hair on the weekends, I can feel the difference in the health of it.    The bonus DVD that came with the book was really cute, too.  It was nice to see some of the techniques demonstrated by real girls.  And I loved the before and after photos they had showing how all the girls used to try to wear their hair straight.  It made me feel like other people understood what I've been going through all this time.  And truly, in the end, the curly hair is so much more luxurious and beautiful!  I was jealous of the girls with the really really curly hair!    Although, I still think I'll always be jealous of those straight haired girls who can just wash and go on vacation or after the gym, I'm ready to embrace what God gave me, and I can't wait to see how much more beautiful my curls get as I continue taking care of them like I should have all these years.  This book, along with naturallycurly.com, is a great way to start the transition back to your naturally curly haired self.  I knocked off one star because I felt like I was left still wanting a little more from the book (that the website was able to provide), but the book is still a must-have for the curly girl.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan is a truly great filmmaker. He really knows the medium of film and how to manipulate it to create an intriguing, believable world. In INCEPTION he tackles the world of dreams. He asks deep questions of the audience like \\"What is reality?\\" or \\"How do we perceive reality differently from a dream?\\" and vice versa. This is a thought-provoking, action-packed, thrill ride of philosophy, science-fiction, and breath-taking special effects.  INCEPTION is ostensibly a \\"heist\\" film. It is about a group of people trying to steal something? Well not exactly. It is actually about people who usually go in to people's dreams to steal things, who embark upon a new kind of mission to plant an idea in the head of a corporate executive to break up his father's business empire. Thus the films name, INCEPTION. Even before this film's climactic \\"heist\\" sequence, there are thrilling action sequences, such as the opening scene of the film. I think Nolan should have spent the first part of the film developing the characters and concept a little more, and really milked the suspense until the actual \\"inception\\" took place. By the time the \\"inception\\" happens, we have already seen some great action sequences, so there is not as much excitement as there could have been had Nolan held up a little at the beginning. Nolan decides to go the route of developing the concept of \\"dream infiltration\\", and all that it entails, throughout the film so that as the story goes on there is a lot of exposition by the characters, especially COBB (Di Caprio) as he pedagogically describes the physics of a dream and how the whole concept actually works, etc. Some of the dialog is clunky and is simply describing the plot. However, that is not enough for me to disparage the film as a whole, after all what film is perfect? This is one of those films however, that not everyone is going to like. I feel like you are either going to love it or hate it. It's just that kind of film. It is a \\"smart\\" thrillerand some people don't want to think when watching a film. That's okay, but this is not a film for those people.  Nolan makes an incredibly taut, suspenseful, thrilling, action-packed, unique, and incredibly intriguing film that inspires, entertains, and makes one ponder. What more can you ask from a film?
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This album by far is one of Kanye's greatest! I don't usually buy albums because I get disappointed, but this one was worth the money!!!!
B001LF347E|4.0|It's funny how you change your mind about things. I remember seeing the previews for this BBC import when it began airing on NBC and later SciFi Channel, but honestly thought it looked... well, kind of bad. Then, this summer I got hooked on another Medieval Fantasy show, Legend of the Seeker, and noticed many LOTS fans also seemed to be fans of Merlin. \\"Well,\\" I thought to myself, \\"if this show's so popular among LOTS fans, it can't be all bad.\\" So I decided to check it out, and man, am I glad I did!   The first few episodes are... well, they're not very good, but they were enough to keep me watching, and by the middle of the season the show had drastically improved. The last seven episodes (there are 13 total) definitely make up for the shaky first half.  As others have pointed out, the special effects are not the best, to put it kindly (come on, this is a BBC show, what did you expect?), but really, the SFX are actually not that important. This show is all about the characters, and the choices that those characters make. The \\"magic\\" is really an afterthought. And the characters are all well-written and well-played, my favorite being the jerk with a heart o' gold Prince Arthur, who goes through some of the best written character development I've ever seen, from spoiled brat at the beginning of the show to a kind-hearted, though still rather thoughtless, young man. You can really see what he'll be like as the Once and Future King.   Though Arthur's my favorite, I'd have to say that Colin Morgan puts in the best performance as the title character. Richard Wilson is fine as Gaius, nothing revelatory about his performance, just good. Anthony Head does a great job of making Uther the character you love to hate, and is obviously having a ball. Angel Coulby as Guinevere really grows as an actress over the show, as does Gwen as a character. Indeed, now that the first three seasons have aired, I would say that Colin and Angel are the show's strongest actors. Katie McGrath rounds out the main cast as the infamous sorceress Morgana, and though Katie is a fine actress and I love her character, I would have to say that she is the weakest actor of the main cast. She does improve over the course of the show, however.  All in all, unlikely as I thought it would be, Merlin has not only become my favorite adaptation of Arthurian legend, of all the books and movies and TV productions based on it, it is currently one of the best shows on TV. And the best thing is, it improves with every season. Season two was miles better than season one, so much so that I would almost encourage potential viewers to start with season two if I didn't find the idea of watching a show out of order so abhorrent. And season three is the best yet by far!   I was overjoyed to hear that it was renewed for a fourth season, and I can only hope that it continues the pattern of each season being better than the last. Also, here's hoping we do get that fifth and final season!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I discovered True Blood after a friend recommended it and lent me their copy.  After watching it I decided I needed to own a copy for my own collection and the Amazon holiday price just couldn't be beat!  This is a fast paced, well acted (the actors accents are great!) show with an engaging plot line that's both interesting and \\"current\\" since vampires seem to be all the rage these days.  I haven't read all the books, but in this case I don't think I mind the deviation from Ms. Harris' original telling as the show is that good!  Watching the second season now with a plan in place to buy the third season as soon as it drops!
B000096IBI|4.0|Charlie Chaplin is without a doubt one of the finest filmmakers of the 20th century. He manages to pack so much complexity into such a deceptively simple story. In Modern Times, his protagonists challenge the forces of mechanization, modernization, and dehumanization at the same time as Chaplin is fighting the losing battle to preserve silent films in the mainstream. This is his last silent film before moving to \\"talkies\\" like the Great Dictator and it stands the test of time as a brilliant monument to humanity and optimism. The DVD comes with plenty of special features. As with all Chaplin DVDs, it isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for and the price is certainly worth it for this masterpiece.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|of all the books ever written by rick riordand , this series will be the biggest entertainment. so well done. great read for any fan of his previous novels. i cant wait till the next book hits the stores.!!!!
0143038419|4.0|(originally posted on blog 09-01-10)<br /><br />Isn't it funny how some of the people we connect with are people we feel close to out of shared experiences, but the way we've met is through a book? Someone has written down words for us to read, left us a message.... we read those words, we've gotten the message, and so we've connected. That's what it felt like while reading this book.  It was like listening to a friend tell you about her harrowing journey through a breakup, insecurity, and a bout of depression and you listen intently because 1)it's interesting and 2) because you want to see if her story holds any marbles of wisdom that can be translated into your own life; maybe learn something you can relate to.<br /><br />Eat Pray Love is a memoir of one woman's journey to find herself in this world and to seek the true meaning of divinity. I don't know about you, but I can truly relate to that. The book is all about her worst days in a hard time in her life and how she worked to get through it all. For Liz, spirituality was her answer.<br />Spirituality is often confused with religion but the two are not one and the same. It can exist in and of itself, completely independent of religion and dogmas. You need only to want to be a seeker of truth to be spiritual. And so that's what Liz seeks and talks about in Eat Pray Love: finding the truth of herself, reflecting on her life and choices, and then putting it all together and trying to make sense of it enough to move forward. I know that this makes the book sound heavy handed and religious but it really isn't. Instead it's a personal record of one year in one woman's life while she travels to Italy to let herself once again know pleasure, to India in order to know prayer, and then to Bali to balance it all out.<br />I definitely see why this book is great for a book club pick; it has so many facets for discussion and interesting tidbits to reflect on with others. Definitely looking forward to reading Liz Gilbert's next book, Committed.
B001853NZK|1.0|The binder received was a piece of junk.  On the right edges of both the top and bottom covers, the plastic was split, exposing the cardboard/foam inserts.  Obviously nobody even looked at the item before they allowed it to leave the store.  On top of that, I had to return this piece of junk in the mail.  I can't believe somebody would pay money to return a useless item that will instantly go into the trash when received.  Might as well have sent a steaming piece of poop in a box.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is a nifty little object that works very well. With a USB stick, it will display titles and artists of all your mp3s and plays very well over whatever channel you set it to use on your car stereo. You can even use the included remote to navigate easily around.       With an Ipod, it differs in that you have to manually use the Ipod controls to navigate and play your songs, and it just gets transmitted through your car stereo. It won't display titles or artists or anything this way, but it still works flawlessly plugged into your car lighter spot. Set yourself up a nice playlist on your Ipod and you're good to go.      Low-cost, Portable music on the go! :)
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I thought Earth was going to stay on my top 1 for years but this one is x10 better.   Anyone who loves animals and nature should get it.    Just one negative point is that there is no French audio. And I'm sur there will be a french version this years or in 2012. Why wait so long instead of just publishing a french version at first...

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|We all had fun with this game. Our kids are 6 and 7. We played with our own rules:  everyone make something at the same time, then the person who guesses the creation correctly first gets a point.  If no one can guess your creation you lose a point. Everyone picked a card and chose what they wanted to make on that card.  When I saw a few of the choices on the cards I was glad we chose these rules!  It's not easy making a steak out of legos. I'm not even sure what the real rules are, but my daughter now pulls out the game and makes things for us to guess. We found this game to be  hard for adults and easy for kids, but lots of fun. It's fun to see their brains at work because some of the cards are hard. The other reviewers who mentioned the lack of peices for the price are somewhat right, as legos are expensive, but I think the amount is similar to other lego products at this price.
185984054X|4.0|A well-cited, excellently argued, and quite scathing polemic against Mother Theresa, and at only 98 pages long it makes for a quick read. Her hipocritical political involvemets and money grubbing weren't particularly surprising, and her fanatical adherence to various sexual beliefs that exacerbated the problems she claimed to be working to solve was something I already knew, but the fact that she not only didn't help indigents, but actually encouraged pain and suffering was not something I expected. Anyone still laboring under the misconception that Mother Theresa was a saint should read this book.
B0041G683W|5.0|Every performance (save one) was impeccable. Many of the performers rival and in some cases surpass those of the 10th Anniversary Dreamcast. Seeing the show on the big screen with a bigger sound system really made the nuances of the genius score come to life. I am thrilled that it is finally on DVD! The use of soft split screens to be able to watch multiple performers' reactions and \\"dialog\\" was a wise creative decision.    The stunning Norm Lewis, whose subtle facial expressions and genuine passion commanded the stage/screen, sang Javert with such power and depth that I actually, for the first time, empathized with his character. Alife Boe's Val Jean was brilliant, with an operatic quality. Samantha Barks shined as Eponine with a stunning vocal performance. Besides being delicious eye-candy, Ramin Karimloo was a standout with his brilliant portrayal of Enjolras. I didn't quite understand the decision of casting Nick Jonas as Marius. He really gave it his all and had some nice moments in the sweeter songs, but lacked the vocal fullness and attack for the more powerful songs. It was adequate but uncomfortably contrasted by his much stronger, seasoned cast mates.    The occasional cut to various instrumental highlights was a wonderful addition and seamlessly included the orchestra as an important part of the ensemble. The encores with the original cast, backed by a chorus of hundreds was breathtaking (particularly when Michael Ball reprised Marius in \\"One Day More\\" the way it should be sung. If you're a Les Mis fan, this movie is a must.

B000002H97|5.0|This is by far the best album in the metal scene. It has an amazing production and you are sucked to its upbeat energy. It is a classic album and it will remain over the years. Enter Sandman - Sad but true - The unforgiven - Whenever i may roam - nothing else matters - my friend of misery  (AMAZING SONGS - I HAVENT HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS)This album is my favourite and i have heard it so many times.Its their best album and the best ever sound i have heard - METALLICA scores.

I purchased a SuperEar for him on Christmas and it was better than watching my children open their presents.  When he turned it on, his eyes lit up and he was smiling again.  He told me he can hear better with the SuperEar than he could with his old hearing aid.  I can't believe we let him go without an amplifier for this long.  I highly recommend the SuperEar.
0060936223|5.0|Maybe you had to grow up during the 50s and 60's to get this book.  Patti writes with love about the art and music scene in New York City - and the life of her friend and lover, Robert Mapplethorpe.     The tone is, fittingly, elagaic. The story is a reminisence.  This is NOT a fact loaded and researched biography. That is some other book. This is a love poem to a friend.    Put in the context of a Nation that was tearing apart Vietnam, a Nation that was tearing itself apart -  the assasinations of Malcom X, Bobby Keennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Watts, Woodstock, Altmont; the Chicago Convention and Kent State; acid, speed, crack and coke?    This is tragedy.  Real life tragedy.  Sad, moving,extrodinary.
B000AMJC2K|3.0|I wouldn't buy this again, I am making \\"do\\" with it because it took me so long to get it in a position that I can \\"tolerate\\" but it is very difficult to push the release button on the arm and move the monitor to the position you want it in. It has very limited range and the up and down adjustment is predetermined in spaced knotches so you are \\"stuck\\" either 3 inches high or 3 inches lower than you want. If you just want your monitor off your desk and keep it in the same location all the time, then I'd say you will be OK with this, but if you need something you can adjust while you're working, this is NOT the arm you want.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Like millions of others, I jumped on the M. Night bandwagon with \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" I liked \\"Unbreakable\\" and \\"Signs,\\" and I'm one of the rare ones who saw some brilliance in the spotty delivery of \\"The Village.\\" I tried to stick with him with his next films, but after the insult of \\"The Happening,\\" I'd had my fill. When I heard that \\"Devil\\" was directed by someone else, while based on a Night idea, I figured I'd give it a chance. My expectations were as low as an elevator can go.<br /><br />The movie starts with a made-for-TV, CSI-type death. It's something that could be resolved in an hour, with bathroom breaks, but \\"Devil\\" only uses this as the catalyst for a South American myth of the devil finding strength in a suicide and using it as an excuse to play havoc with a few other sinful souls. The voice-over that explains all this is done by a security guard in a Philadelphia skyscraper. Soon he is a witness, through security cameras, of the devil's meeting that occurs in one of the building's trapped elevators. Five people are on board. All have secrets. All become progressively freaked out as the violence escalates. One is the devil in disguise.<br /><br />The film starts with a verse from the New Testament, about the devil seeking those he may devour, and it ends with another biblical sentiment. In between, it focuses on the panic and mental anguish caused by individuals' sins, and although there is some B-movie violence, it is more psychological than anything. The man trying to get to the bottom of the whole mess is a Philadelphia detective who has some demons of his own from the untimely death of his wife and son in a collision with a drunk driver five years earlier.<br /><br />In the end the movie has its ups and downs, its spiritual clarity and obscurity, and a few moments of grace and forgiveness. In some ways its simplicity is what made it more satisfying for me. \\"Devil\\" doesn't try to be overly smart or overly philosophical; it simply lets its characters make their choices, good or bad, and expects us to follow along. In the same way, viewers must decide: is this an elevator on the way up or on the way down? As for me, I think it's a ride I would take again.or bad, and expects us to follow along.

B000W91RUG|5.0|OMG!!!  My husband and I started watching this series on TV during the third season.  We immediately became HOOKED!  So, for Christmas I bought him the first season so we could go back and watch what we had missed.  What a GREAT purchase!!!  We were both under the weather over Christmas so this was perfect.  Once our 8 month old went down for a nap, after opening and playing with presents, we hopped on the couch and laughed until it hurt.  This was so funny that we would put it in and watch over and over.  These guys are hillarious and if you haven't seen it from the beginning, it is a riot to go back and see how it all started. We totally recommend this!!!!  Since we finished Season 1 off the day after Christmas, I looked up season 2 on Amazon and it will be delivered today.   Can't wait to watch it over New Year's break.
B003RS5JJY|2.0|Okay, first a Dexter watcher has to accept the premise of the show. But within the parameters set by the writers, there is no way Rita would accept Dexter being gone so much--not with the previous admission of drug use. Sorry, but this glaring flaw combined with the ridiculous coincidences in the Trinity case, I fear Dexter is becoming silly.

B0036EH3XE|3.0|I got the last season of Lost for Christmas.  Was so excited to watch it and was, not exactly disappointed, just not sure what I watched to tell the truth.  When Juliette told Sawyer \\"it worked\\", I was certain the flash sideways was how their lives were unfolding in an alternate reality after the bomb.  Then I thought everybody in the \\"island reality\\" had to die in order for the people in the \\"other reality\\" to remember (kind of?) where they had been before the reality shift.  Then I realized I was trying to make sense of something that could not be made sensible.  The really big question I have (out of all the many questions) is when did they all die?  Was it when the plane crashed?  That is the only answer that seems to fit.  And they were in purgatory (as many other reviewers have said).  The memories they were having in the flash sideways were the trials and tribulations their souls had to endure to prove they were worthy to move on. . .Now, let me say this, some of this season was a total waste of time and quite frankly it was crap.  \\"Across the Sea\\" was a BIG waste of time that could have been used to really clear up some things, but instead we get an insane woman killing the mother of Jacob and \\"the nameless one\\".  She raised them to take over guardianship of the glowing hole in the island, but nobody ever said what the light was.  Oh wait, here we go, the whole thing is symbolism, the light is really where our castaways are trying to get to because they are all dead.  Ya think?  Anybody and everybody's guess is as good as mine.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This has been my families favorite series for the past year or so.  My daughter is 10 and my son is 16.  We love the story, how it depicts life long ago, the issues they face and how they solve them.  We are on the 6th season and have watch everyone of them.  Thank you Jane Seymore and Joe Lando for demonstrating character values that are valuable to my children.  Values such as honesty, trustworthiness, family, concern for others, unconditional love, respect, standing up for what you believe in, relationships, etc.  Great content!
B003MZ0I84|4.0|have all the other Maroon 5 albums and this one did not disappoint.  I buy most of my songs in single from through amazon and iTunes.  I wanted to buy this CD in whole form so i would have it in the car and on my computer.

B0045ZAQSM|4.0|This frothy, light, slightly shapeless but endearing comedy is further proof of the protean nature of Akin's amazing talents.<br /><br />While nowhere near as good as his great, dark comedy-drama `Head On' or his complex. philosophical `The Edge of Heaven', or even his delightful music documentary 'Crossing the Bridge' - all of which are must-sees - I appreciate that Akin seems more interested in exploring different genres and stories than creating a signature style.<br /><br />This is the kind of comedy that makes you smile more than laugh, and is stronger on character and acting than on comic set pieces, but even the jokes that don't work aren't annoying.  Its too sweet and full of life to get cranky at.<br /><br />A shaggy, likable young Greek man living in Germany tries to start his own restaurant, juggling his ex-con brother, his out-of town girlfriend,  his slightly insane chef, and a rival who wants to take over his space and develop condos.  It's not an `important' film, but it captures something wonderful about being young and trying to find your place in the world.
B0041KKYEW|2.0|*SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*<br /><br />Look guys, I do \\"get it\\". Before you tell me to \\"go watch a Die Hard box set\\", let me say that I am an adult moviegoer and I see at least 50 smaller/indie/foreign/what have you movies a year. So therefore that defense it totally useless. OK, now let's get on with the review.<br /><br />I'm not really down with Darren Aronofsky to begin with. I saw Requiem For A Dream When I was teen and boy, that film messed me up good. I was compelled to watch it after being shown a compilation of clips in an anti-drug presentation, so I sought out my friend, who has quite possibly the biggest DVD collection ever. After it was done... well let's say that movie taught me my lesson about drugs well enough. In the following years his films didn't really do much- Pi was an incomprehensible mess, The Fountain I watched 3 times and didn't get, and The Wrestler started off nice but ended poorly. However, I was interested in Black Swan when I saw the trailer with Paranormal Activity 2, so tonight I finally saw it.<br /><br />About the dancing scenes, as much as I actively participate in dance but know nothing about ballet, I thought they were well done. Like I said, I know absolutely nothing about ballet, so you best not trust my judgment. I thought Natalie Portman did a fantastic job, and I totally believed that Natalie did her own dancing. I thought the cast did pretty good jobs considering they were not dancers to begin with. Natalie's performance is, of course, the reason to see the movie. She is pure cash money with each performance, and this movie shows. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey were good too. Oh and the movie looked pretty too. That's where the praise unfortunately stops.<br /><br />Basically people seem to be raving over nothing but just a middle-of-the-road horror-thriller, but with bits of weird sex added in and several over-the-top shock moments that seemed more unintentionally hilarious than shocking. Basically it's just Mulholland Drive with any being able to care for the characters taken out (We even get the obligatory lesbian sex scene- just minus having a place). In other words, you're getting a typical messed up girl story. I didn't really feel for the Nina character at all. For one, I dunno why she wouldn't just get a red flag when Vincent Cassel's character forced a kiss on her, or when he told her to touch herself. Yet somehow she's smart enough to lash out at her over-controlling mom and tell her \\"I'm not 12 anymore\\" and dump the plush toys down the garbage disposal.<br /><br />Truth be told, Black Swan is honestly just an incoherent mess. There are moments of brilliance, which all go to naught when something that reduces you to laughter (at an inappropriate moment too) comes. Yeah as you guessed, I laughed at several moments that weren't meant to be funny. Like when Nina masturbates and finds her mom in the room. Or Winona Ryder going all joker on herself. The film looks nice, has good special effects and performances, but you can dress up a pig in fancy clothing and it's still a pig.<br /><br />Oh, but what do I know. Like most Oscar bait nowadays, this film will go to win awards and enjoy a bit of hype for a while. And then, of course, like any other movie, people are going to regret the hype and it will end up on most people's overrated lists.<br /><br />Cue people telling me \\"I don't get it\\".g able to care for the characters taken out (We even get the obligatory lesbian sex scene- just minus having a place).

B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a wonderful CD with some classics and some new and unique pieces.  It makes a great listen and an even better gift!    Enjoy!!!
B003UESJJC|5.0|This movie needed a bluray transfer worthy of it's stature and it got it. Beautiful video and audio, it took a long time for this to show up but the wait was worth it.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|this book was well worth the money. it was funny and sad. i loved how as he listened to the tapes he put in his thoughts as well. i didnt really like the end because one it was over and two because she wasnt alive. but overall BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Well done box set. I'm especially pleased with the packaging. The DVDs are in paperboard envelopes instead of irritating plastic containers. The whole set fits together very nicely and there's not too much extra dumb stuff, just a book. Pretty happy overall.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Buble has brought a new sound to music and you can find different types of music in the   album.  I certainly recommend it highly.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|Worst movie I've ever seen. They're all wearing the same shade of lipstick, acting was horrible (like a jerked up Voldemort), and there was no plot! Graphics might be HQ, but the actual film (plot, characters/development, suspension of disbelief (impossible to maintain)) was HORRID.<br /><br />Quality over quantity, people! PLOT OVER WHATEVER THIS EVEN IS (can not possibly be called art).
1596177373|3.0|The cards are fun for Tim Burton fans, however, beware that the only cards with artwork on them are the face cards an joker cards.  I thought there would be pictures on all, but this is not true so I was a little dissappointed.  Still, function well as cards should....
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I had seen this  in the theater, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I just don't recommend it as a movie for children to see,just a mite bit scary.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I actually just deleted my five page reveiw by accident. So, in brief, you should read the book and I swear to god that you won't regret it. I think that it is the best book that Ive ever read and I read ALOT. It has characters that Are deep and seem real and the plotline actually has a point,unlike many other novels that are on shelves today. You can also pick up a little german while you are at it. Happy Reading!
B0000V6SOG|3.0|I LOOOOOVE the movie \\"Love Actually,\\" ESPECIALLY Craig Anderson's score, and this is the only album version that includes any of the orchestral tracks. That being said, I think it is far from perfect. The tracks aren't in chronological order with when they are played in the film (which I know is common with film soundtracks, but it still annoys me). \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Jump (For My Love)\\" are not the same versions as in the film, AYNIL is a more subdued and in my opinion kind of boring cover, and Jump is a cover. There are also some tracks that I don't recognize from the film at all and just plain don't like (my least favorite being Wyclef Jean's \\"Take Me As I Am\\"). And the whole reason that I bought this version (for the orchestral score pieces) was a letdown--there are only 3 of these tracks, and none of them are that long. It's an okay album and definitely the best version available, but it still leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Fantastic filmaking, captured in the best possible technology for home viewing. I wish I could see this in an IMAX theater, but my living room is going to have to suffice for now.    From age 4 to 40, since Christmas we have watched over and over. Certain scenes are replayed more than once. The quality of the picture is superb.
B003VIW8DK|3.0|Bryan Ferry still sounds like the slick Lothario he invented for himself some 30 odd years ago. With \\"Olympia,\\" the suave and dapper Ferry seems to be walking the same ground he always has. While there are some really cool numbers here, there's something missing. The crooner is still oozing sophistication in a very dapper outfit, but the suit is, upon closer inspection, the same one he's always worn. Now the cuffs are getting frayed.<br /><br />The earliest hint is the first sound on the album; \\"You Can Dance\\" opens with a sample from Roxy's brilliant farewell, \\"Avalon.\\" There's also the much ballyhooed guest appearances from Brian Eno, Phil Manzanera, and Andy MacKay. If that isn't enough to make you wonder if Roxy wasn't in the fore of all involved party's minds, there is the photo of Kate Moss, draped across the cover like those grand old 70's album covers. Yes, Ferry's evocative. However, he's rarely been this eager to invoke.<br /><br />It makes \\"Olympia\\" a 50/50 affair. When it works - the sublime \\"Heartache By Numbers, for instance, or the funky \\"BF Bass\\" - that old magic creeps up on you. His choice in a good cover serves him well, as his take on Traffic's \\"\\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" are enough to make you forget the horror of \\"Dylanesque.\\" The synths on \\"Tender Is The Night\\" are icy and haunting, bringing the album to a satisfying conclusion. But I am so used to being able to play a Bryan Ferry album from end to end without any clinkers (almost all the Roxy Catalog, most of his solos till \\"Mamouna\\" in 1994), that even a return to form such as this is merely a beautiful echo.

0525951652|4.0|Although it took  awhile to get pulled into the story, I found myself fascinated by the characters living their lives in the context of World War 1.  I have never had such fun learning and really enjoyed the 1000 page read--revolution, romance and romps with lots of historic details.  I look forward to the next one.
B003K025V4|5.0|Miley Cyrus first entered the entertainment scene with her successful hit TV show \\"Hannah Montana\\". She gained thousands of fans through the show and the music \\"Hannah\\" produced. Miley then released one self titled album with Hannah Montana, then she released her sophomore album \\"Breakout\\". Both these CD's recieved mostly positive reviews from the critics. However as her time with Disney was running out, Miley wanted to show the world that she wasn't Hannah Montana anymore. She wanted to show a more mature side of her, showing her fans that she is becoming a woman. I feel that Miley did that on this album. I understand that this album is nothing like Miley has made before, but in my opinion, I feel it is still as good as any of her other \\"clean girl\\" image albums. I feel this album really establishes her as an adult, and the music is more mature with a different sound and more mature lyrics. I do agree that she may have gone a little bit far as expressing herself as \\"not Hannah Montana\\" anymore with her videos such as \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" and \\"Who Owns My Heart\\", because she still has younger fans following her, and this is no image to portray to them, but as a teenage male, I feel this album was excellent and that's why I brought it. My parents said they would not buy it for me because they do not support what she is doing, but no one really knows what her life is like, and what she's \\"told\\" to do or what she \\"should\\" do. She was a good person and still is, she has just strayed down the wrong path at the moment. If I was to go through each song it would be pointless because I love them all. I feel she expresses almost every expression she's feeling and the music just takes me somewhere else. It makes me look at my life and reflect on the person I am and who I want to be.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I read parts of this book to my wife, who, like so many female readers, had previously read it. So much has been already been written about the superb characterization and a decent plot, that I don't feel I can add much to it. I found the dialogue witty and intelligent.<br /><br />Austin demonstrates that timeless problem of how men and women continue to misunderstand each other. The language of civility is a hoot, and descriptions of what is socially appropriate add tensions and obstacles. This is a marvelous read and a worthwhile way to spend some time over the holidays.
B002VECM6S|3.0|Too much stereotyping, not enough depth.  Lifetime TV would have been a great venue for this bit of fluff. I truly wanted to like this film, but there was just not much substance as the entire storyline was: rich white family saves poor black kid, black kid makes good.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|EASY A    This film turned out to be much better than I had expected to be honest, I knew it would be good but it was better than I thought. Still to be honest I was not really looking to see this that bad, until my girl got it and had me watch it with her. Of course it was along the lines of these new John Hughes style flicks but it was good. I don't think it turned out as classic as Hughes's films but it was a nice homage to the man's movies.    Olive [Emma Stone] is your typical teenager in high school just looking to fit in even though she is an obvious individual with a personality. Still she tries to fit in any way especially with her best friend who she ends up lying to about not only a date but loosing her virginity. Like most news that is passed around in high school it all starts in the bathroom, and the wrong person hears it. Almost immediately the rumors start and she now has a reputation, although not the best one she is now noticed.    Of course now she is getting all kinds of offers and she even kinda takes them, kinda. She takes payment for her services but she only agrees to say she does stuff with people to help their rep. Of course her legend only grows as does her problems and her feelings about everything. She must deal with what people think of her, some religious students, and of course her best friend who is turning on her. Oh and did I mention the guy she actually likes, makes for an interesting time.    Written by Bert V. Royal and directed by Will Gluck this film manages to rise above being just another average film. The direction is nice and the script is excellent as it plays on not only John Hughes films but also on the book \\"Scarlet Latter\\". Of course if you know that story that explains the A part of the title of the film more s than her just being at school, I am sure you know what I mean.    Emma stone is excellent here as she has been in everything I have seen her in thus far; this may be her best performance yet. Every one including Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow but it was real nice to see Amanda Bynes in this. I will admit right now I am a fan of hers mainly because I loved a show back in the day called \\"All That\\". She did a great job as the arch enemy of Emma here with the whole overly religious thing. Of course the film makers had her play that stereo typical over the top religious person but it was good.    This film ended up being pretty good but as it went it started to slip a little bit, but not enough to hurt it. Over all I would say it is worth a rental at least especially if you are into this type of film. A fun cast mixed with a great script made for a good film, well worth the time. Also Emma Stone impressed me with this film, I liked more in this then I did in \\"Zombieland\\" which was another film I liked.
0199536961|5.0|I ordered this book from campus_ministry_support, and about ten minutes later, realized that I would rather go into the store and buy a copy of the book (this would be faster for me). I contacted campus_ministry_support and they got back to me right away, confirming my cancellation. Very helpful and courteous!!
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|DEVIL    When I first heard about this film I was excited because I have always found these types of movies entertaining. M. Night Shyamalan was on board here as a producer and also came up with this I believe so I was interested to say the least. I heard many things about this movie, some good some bad so I had to check it out. After watching this I have to say I liked more than I thought but it wasn't what I expected. I was actually expecting something a little more, scary I guess. But still for a pg 13 film it was good.    A man has committed suicide by way of jumping out of a window of a building; of course the police are called in. while there it seems there is a problem in the same building, an elevator is stuck with a group of people stuck on it. The thing is something wrong is going on, like people getting killed inside the elevator. As the police and security look on from a security camera they try to figure it out and stop what it going on. The thing is an evil presence may be inside that building and it just may be the devil, here to punish the wicked.    The idea behind this film is great and really had me hyped about this movie; I always seem to like these types of flicks. I must say that the atmosphere here is nice but this movie reminds me of the Twilight Zone, Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt and stuff like that. With that said it feels as short as one of those episodes, really it feels really short. The acting at least is good especially those in the elevator, pretty much every one here does a good job.    This film is far from the best ever and that is a little disappointing, it had the potential to be a classic. Still this is not as bad as some think and is worth a rental at least, it has some good special features so that is always a plus. Also while it may be a little predictable it does not try to over do anything, like that they did that.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|The movie without saying is one of those that anyone can watch, and digest it in a way that will help appreciate one's existing situation or looking life in a profound new way. Will Smith has become a critically acclaimed actor in this film (and also Seven Pounds).    The blu-ray picture is sharp and shows really fine details. Audio is pretty darn good for a drama.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|You can clearly see in the bluray that Kim Cattrall as well as some other actress's have the wrinkles in their forehead and throat completely digitally blurred out! You can especially see it in Kim when SJP tells her she is engaged. It's freaky lookin!
B0007M22TI|5.0|Gorgeous women with beautiful voices and great talent.  I've watched their Christmas DVD and the one made at Slane Castle.  Outstanding and very entertaining.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|That Ke$ha has a number one album and Monae's barely broke the top 100 is proof of everything wrong with the music industry today. Monae is a visionary with this concept album, based off of a narrative about a psychiatric patient in a futuristic society where music, dancing, and love have been outlawed. Tightrope is probably the most well known song and with good reason, it dares you to not get up and dance while it's playing. There are a number of wonderful soulful ballads as well- Oh Maker and Say You'll Go are my favorites.     Please buy this album and give Monae the recognition she deserves.
0393072231|5.0|I know nothing at all about finance but found this a gripping, fascinating account of the personalities and processes behind the biggest financial meltdown since the Great Depression. The book has the narrative of a thriller even though we know how it all ends. The author talks to both financial experts and total laymen, and succeeds in engaging both ends of the reader spectrum. I would say this book qualifies as essential reading given the massive implications this meltdown has for the average tax payer. My biggest take-away from this was the sick realisation that Wall Street is often little more than a casino for the elite, with astoundingly little personal consequence for getting the big bets totally wrong.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I'm one of THOSE Josh Groban fans. I first heard him sing with Charlotte Church-so I've been there pretty much since the beginning. I went to an internet café at an ungodly hour in Spain so that I could buy tickets to his \\"Awake\\" tour the minute they were released.  I have all his albums-I mean ALL of them: not just his studio releases, but his concert albums, his special releases, and those he's done for soundtracks. He could sing the telephone book and I'd love it.     Unfortunately, I think him singing the telephone book would be better than this album.     I say that because I love J Gro. He's  epic, not just for his heavenly voice, but also because he is a risk-taker. He began with a popera sound, his voice soaring over a full orchestra. Then he branched out in all directions. J Gro has proven that he can play it stripped down (examples: \\"You're Still You,\\" \\"Now or Never,\\" \\"Awake\\") and that he can work with ANYONE (examples: \\"February Song\\" with Dave Matthews, his cover of Lincoln Park's \\"December,\\" \\"Machine\\" with Herbie Hancock, just to name a few). And it has always been absolute magic.     This time, he worked with Rick Rubin and stripped things down. And...this time, it just didn't take. I'd be lying if I didn't say that this album is pretty disappointing.     The reason why? J Gro's songs are incredibly varied, but they are always held together by his unique, pure, resonant voice. He sings in such a way that no one else on the pop/rock/r&b scene could sing a song the way he does. For the most part, that doesn't happen here.     As I've listened to the album (and I did try to give it a chance to grow on me), I've often thought \\"I can imagine a number of other artists singing this song.\\"     There are a couple of exceptions: \\"If I Walk Away\\" and \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" are the excellent standouts.  The funny thing is, neither of them really fit into the folksy/indie rock feel of this album. The former fits more with the songs on the \\"Closer\\" album and the latter fits better with the more international feel of the \\"Awake\\" album.       I'll still probably go see him when he goes on tour, because I'm that type of fan (and I think \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" live would be amazing!). But, I'll be honest: this isn't his best work.     If you're not the type of J Gro fan that buys everything he releases, I'd say buyer beware. Download the two good songs off itunes or rip it from someone.    Let's hope he gets that magic back for the next one.
B003O85W3A|2.0|I gave it time.  I gave it chances.  Because they're ARCADE FIRE...they who came out of nowhere with Funeral, debuting with an already fully-formed aesthetic, and the sheer confidence of a stadium-packing triumphant band.  And then Neon Bible with an even HUGER sound (an impossible thought on the heels of something like Wake Up from Funeral).    And now this.  Watered down, tepid, and approaching dull in the shadow of those albums that came before it.    In a way, I envy those who came to Arcade Fire with this album and found it eye-opening, for what they'll get to experience going back through the previous releases.  At the same time, I fear that this will define their sound for new listeners who simply won't bother with their earlier masterpieces.    So to those who haven't heard Wake Up, Intervention, (Antichrist Television Blues), and what used to be the enormously impressive - awesome in the literal sense of the word - sound of what preceded this near-throwaway set, DO IT NOW.  You will think very differently about The Suburbs after.    I should note, however, that there was another reviewer who suggested that the shoddy engineering and production may be the culprit with its unimpressive sound.  Their live shows apparently haven't lost the energy, so maybe it will be remastered and improved upon in the future.
B00275EHJG|5.0|this movie is awesome it is the best one yet tom hanks and tim allen are the most talented and funny that it makes this movie so much fun to watch. to make it a family night you could watch all 3 movies back to back. the same with the santa clause 1,2,3, with tim allen. the whole family would enjoy it. the toy story 3 movie was a good find on amazon.com @ only $ 13.00 dollars. I would recomend this website to everyone that is looking for movies. thanks again!
B002ZG976U|5.0|Well in my point of view Burlesque was a movie that kept me entertained. When I was finished watching it i went almost instantly on itunes and bought all the songs. Cher is superb with her witty comments and beautiful singing. Christina drops the bomb when she first sings also her sweet and determined personality is inspiring. All in all this movie was a joy to watch.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Well if you are a pink fan this is a must have!  She is so talented!  I love greatest hits it really brought back some memories!  I am so glad that I made the purchase its been playing in my car since I got it!!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|We gave this to our daughter for Christmas (she's under 2) and absolutely loves it!! I had read some reviews that weren't that great, but I think people forget who the toy is for! I think the doll is really cute and well made. I like that it has a soft body and that the arms/legs are plastic. My daughter loves carrying it around and sleeping with it.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|The album includes a mix of rnb, hip hop and pop. This is just the begnning for a promising rapper. Her lyrical raps are incredible. Some of the best tracks on the album are Romans Revenge, Moment For Life, Here I Am and Blazin. Make sure you listen to her rapping on Romans Revenge featuring Eminem. Absolutely Incredible!!! She will be an srtist to look out for in 2011. For a first album great effort but I'm sure there will be even better records in the future! Exceptional rapper.
1597801585|5.0|It seems that most of the readers have done a wonderful job of expressing the excellent quality of Mr. Bacigalupi's storytelling so I will instead confine myself to countering some of the complaints leveled against his writing technique and world building.    It is true, for instance, that the author makes extensive use of native language and eastern religious concepts but this should not be surprising given the books setting, nor should a direct English translation be expected, many of the words left untranslated have no direct English analogue. Having studied Japanese as a language I can attest that many concepts do not possess a one to one translation. There is also a great deal of sex and sexual abuse in the book and while it can be argued that it is at points excessive it in no ways detracts from the quality of the story and underlines the hopelessness of the protagonists situation.     On a technical note I find it very interesting that many readers are so offended by the technical aspects of Mr. Bacigalupi's future Thailand. The book has more in common with well thought out Biopunk, the use of genetically engineered species and the subversion of bacteria to manufacture nano scale structures, than it does to steampunk and its Victorian aesthetics. First of all is the novel use of springs as an energy storage method, it is made very clear that these are not made of traditional spring steel but have more in common with the carbon nanotube super springs being developed at universities like MIT. These prototype springs can theoretically offer energy storage on par with a lithium ion battery while being much more resilient and longer lasting.     Some reviewers have also complained about the carbon credits being charged on the elephants used to power a factory. Animals are not carbon neutral, not only do they generate large amounts of CO2 from respiration, they also generate considerable amounts of methane, a major greenhouse gas. Additionally it is made very clearthat the authorities are gouging the foreign owned factory for money. I applaud Mr. Bacigalup for considering both the technical and cultural aspects of this issue.      Also viewed incredulously is the idea that bioengineered humans can exist in a world that is so technically crude, it is easy to forget in this day and age, living in a developed country with vastly interconnected markets, that not all people have access to all products and in fact the few genetic marvels of the book are the result of either desperate government research or far more sophisticated technical bases in Japan and North America. The book is taking place in a Thailand fallen on hard times, what do expect, flying cars?    If you want a well thought out and carefully written look at a future imperfect and the darker parts of human nature, then I would strongly suggest this book. The writing is fantastic, the concepts are fresh, and the characters range believably from petty to noble, and as grim as it is there is light at the very end. If you come expecting a story of future superscience and adventure, well, sorry to disappoint.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book took a little bit of getting into... and it was definitely interesting and fun to read (if you can get by not being able to pronounce any of the location names properly, unless you know Swedish, and seriously, does anyone know Swedish?).... but I am hoping that the next 2 in the series are a little better.  But I did enjoy it and, especially since it was only $5 for the Kindle version.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I saw this concert at the Hollywood bowl, and it was fantastic. The dvd is just as good , if not better, because of the proximity of the cameras.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Another film released nationwide in theaters in 3D. Now it is arriving for all to enjoy in their home in 3D. Oh wait, no not all. Who do you think you are? Some can enjoy, those who decided to go out to buy a new Panasonic 3D TV. What if you don't want to buy a Panasonic, what if you like Sony or Toshiba, well, then you are out of luck my friend. I wonder what the Harvard business school thinks of this idea. Make a new technology that will take time to catch on. Limit any and all software for it, then make special deals with certain companies so not all consumers can enjoy the limited content. If I didn't know any better I would say they are trying to sabotage themselves. I hope others out there like me, who don't feel they should have to go to ebay and pay over $100 for  Avatar, will join me in a boycott. I will not buy any release of any 3D blu-ray movie that was first released in an exclusive deal for those who bought a certain brand TV. I will never purchase Avatar, How to Train your Dragon, Shreks, and so on. Not even once they are finally released to the rest of us. START THE BOYCOTT, JOIN ME! I loved How to Train Your Dragon, and its a real shame I will not watch it again. Shame on you Dreamworks, Samsung, Panasonic, and 20th Century Fox for working as hard as you do to destroy a product your trying to sell to us. I do want to add that I just bought Alice in Wonderland, a film I rated mediocre at best, just because it was released at the same time to all consumers. I also do want to send out a thank you so far to Warner Brothers, Disney, Universal, and Sony, keep up the good work!! One last thought, what you are also doing is encouraging piracy to the fullest extent. If people cant buy the product, yet it is available, and people are using your product like a black market item on ebay, they will turn to piracy. GOOD JOB GUYS!
B004B8DH98|1.0|Life is too short to have to sit through this hugely disappointing film. Clooney is Clooney but the film is a total bore.
4770031246|5.0|Just will join the chorus of other reviewers to say that not one page is wasted in this book. Extremely informative on all accounts of bento-making. Not much to say except that all recipes so far have been quick, easy, and delicious. An absolute must-buy for all Japanese lovers!
B000002SYG|1.0|I was really happy to have found a collection that took me back too the eighties. I was very disappointed with this product. All my favorite songs skipped. It only got worse as I cleaned the disk. Just horrible. I would not suggest any purchase from this site...NO Way!
B003EI2EH2|1.0|I was fascinated by \\"the four hour workweek\\" and bought this with my eyes closed. I did not expect to be so disappointed. There is no writing style, no wit, no unexpected insight on fitness. Just a mixed bag of Mens' health-type tips, mostly bullet points. I really feel like i was ripped of my money and mislead.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I had Tron on VHS since it first came out. Just about 6 months ago I bought the 20TH Anniversary Edition at a garage sale for $3.00. I am sure glad I did not pass it by and leave without it.I've been told by a guy I work with and let barrow it that his friends are envious. For those complaining about the price it's to be expected. Disney likes to release things and then take them away. Since it's not available from Disney people are selling the movie for a high price. Some people are crazy enough to pay the $200 price. As for myself no. It is a great movie for when it first came out and now it is a classic. So until Disney re-releases out on dvd again do not expect the price to go lower.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie was a Christmas gift and played without any problems.  It shipped out promptly and packaging was in good condition as well. Would do business with again.
6304711905|5.0|purchased as gift for son-in-law.   he was thrilled to get movie. arrived in timely fashion during Christmas rush.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|How long has it been since you've seen a flick where you didn't have to think that much? Where you could walk out of the theater and say \\"Hey, that was fun\\". Well, this is it. Chris Pine says hello to Denzel Washington and that's about all the calmness you're going to get. 90 minutes on the fast track.   That's why this film deserves 5 stars. A true action movie that will give you the best thrill for your buck.   Mr. Washington and Mr. Pine work well off each other. Rosario Dawson and Lew Temple brighten up the storyline with some great character portrayals. Mark Bomback has written some great dialogue that's minimal, to the point, and fully understandable. Credit must be given to Tony Scott and Ben Seresin for not going haywire with shaky handheld camera techniques.    This is fun entertainment.   See it.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|so I've been listening to this for the first time and it's disappointing.  Her voice sounds very limited to me and what I thought as the tracks went along is that maybe she's a smoker so I looked it up and she does appear to be one.  She was a perfect chick when she first came out.  It's unfortunate that she is self-destructive, particularly to her great instrument, her voice.  The band is pretty engaging but the singing is not quite there, and she talks too much in her songs.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Great Story - maybe the best of the 3 toy story movies because they had to come up a story to fit the characters, then add new characters and make it all fit together.
0307272702|5.0|I was initially suspicious of the low carb fanatacism because, well, of its fanatacism. I know scores of people who have lost weight using the Atkins, or low carb approach, but was concerned over the long-term health benefits or risks.  I also know scores of people who have lost weight counting calories alone.  I, for one, have lost weight with both approaches. Looking good is one thing, living longer is another. Taubes does a meticulous job of debulking years and years of confusing research, some of which is clearly biased by funding streams and the like. This is difficult subject matter, because there are a multitude of variables and little reliable ways to control them.  The recent Stanford study is informative in that it, not surprisingly, supports the low-carb approach to weight lose. I see the point Taubes makes about weight lose and carbs, but I'm not sure about (I don't disagree with...yet...maybe) other postulates in his books. In conclusion, the author does a splendid job in a very difficult field and I am recommending this book to my friends and patients.     I would like to see Taubes sort out the mess of the \\"science\\" of atheroma formation: Is it cholesterol, inflammation, injury, bacteria? I've read some of the literature on this, and the jury is still out, in my opinion. His unbiased journalistic approach would be well-received and secure his name in halls of journalism and science. Whatever it would conclude, I'm sure it would be closer to the truth than we are right now. Taubes is a resource we should pay attention to.
B004FECNIO|5.0|I'm not sure why people are giving this a bad review. But everybody is allowed their opinion. I will say this movie was well done and still brings me to tears. I do intend to purchase the bluray and am hoping the video is up to bluray standards. This is a heartwarming film with scifi thrown in and I can watch it over and over again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|A terrific workout in 3 levels: 1, 2 and 3.  Each workout is about 20 minutes with a 5-minute warm up and a 5-minute cool down.  Start with level 1 and gradually progress until you get to level 3.  You will work hard and you will see results from this DVD!
B00005O5CM|4.0|...to admitting I like this film. First time I heard about it I brushed it off, a chick flick of sorts, I had no interest in it. But as I started getting to know more about Reese Witherspoon I had to watch this as it seems to be one of her best films. With her innocent look and acting I cant help but like the film. I know its eird to have a guy admit to liking this film...but Im very open minded ha Not a bad film.
0817439390|4.0|Good Beginner book but I though Scott Kelby Digital Photography Book was better. Has some good points but didn't find it as easy to read.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Muse till the movie Twilight came out. I bought this CD and have played it over and over!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|\\"The Pacific\\" is one of Spielberg and Hank's best collaborations since it's sister show \\"Band of Brothers\\". While there is substantially more romance displayed in this series (made for HBO) the leading ladies don't disappoint. The acting is great and the scenes leave you on the edge of your seat. The depiction of war as ugly, and how it leaves good men disturbed for what they do amid their actions in battle, is well directed and produced. This is not a series for the weak hearted or those who shy from gore or death. \\"The Pacific\\" is set during WW II and takes the audience on a vivid and accurate tales told from the mouths of the G.I. and Marines whose assaults on several key Pacific Arena battles that took so many lives from those who fought and died. The historical accuracy is grandoise and the grueling and grim battle scenes are an in depth look at valor and the dark side of humanity and what we must acknowledge as our sacrifices for freedom from that era. I am hoping that Hanks and Spielberg will collaborate to produce further war documentaries of this sort for Korea and Vietnam as well. I especially appreciate the first hand stories and testimonies of the few surviving G.I.s that are interviewed for the actual stories told of such remarkable pride, passion, and pain.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade is one of the greats! Her silky smooth voice is so captivating, no matter what genre she sings. If you're a fan, this Best of CD is for you. It has all her hits that we know and love. You won't be disappointed.
B00195BM3Y|4.0|This album is for fans of the post-punk sound, but I'm a big one. It's based on cold, echoing, reverberating guitars, much like its contemporaries by [[ASIN:B000002H5P The Cure]], [[ASIN:B000002MGT New Order]], and [[ASIN:B000EFTELC The Comsat Angels]]. But even though I'd heard these ideas many times before, Script Of The Bridge still offered me enough to warrant close attention. As in all the best post-punk, those echoing guitar chords are often arranged into hypnotic riffs that make effective use of pauses and changes in volume, such as the confident, weary stride of \\"Less Than Human.\\" Even when the riff itself is pretty simple, there is some interesting detail in the execution. The hook in \\"Second Skin\\" is the same drawn-out four-note rise/fall sequence that appears in countless new wave and ambient songs, but here, each long note is actually split up into many repetitions of the same note, played in a fast drone. In other words, they're creating a slow sound by playing fast, creating a strange contrast: a slow, majestic advance, but with a feeling of energetic motion.    \\"Second Skin\\" seems much shorter than its actual seven-minute length. It flies by so easily and gracefully that one might even miss how complex it is. The opening on keyboards is heavenly, as impeccably produced as music could get before [[ASIN:B00005Y1TL electronica]] came along. It then breaks into the main body, with its slow/fast contrast, but then it slows down a bit for a dreamy, echoing outro, where singer Mark Burgess first marvels, \\"No wonder it feels like I'm walking on air,\\" and then is overtaken by layers of overdubbed voices, worriedly muttering, \\"Something's banging on my door.\\" The stuff dreams are made of, indeed.    \\"View From A Hill\\" is the album's other dreamy soundscape, more keyboard-oriented, with a much longer instrumental section. At the other end of the spectrum are a few up-tempo numbers, like the first track \\"Don't Fall\\" and the indignant \\"Paper Tigers.\\" \\"Don't Fall\\"clearly shows the punk roots of post-punk with a simple driving rhythm and the muddiest production on the album. \\"Paper Tigers,\\" on the other hand, is much more refined, with a galloping drone-riff, possibly the best of the whole album, plus a sorrowful, grieving chant-chorus.    It's impressive that this was The Chameleons' debut -- it's much more fully realized than [[ASIN:B000679N96 Three Imaginary Boys]], Movement, or [[ASIN:B000E41KPQ Waiting For A Miracle]]. It does have some filler songs: it seems to me that \\"Monkeyland\\" is a bit slow to start, and breaks up the energetic standard set by \\"Don't Fall\\" and \\"Here Today.\\" Still, the music never really sounds bad, it consistently ranges from OK to great. The only problem is Mark Burgess' voice, as in, he doesn't have much of one. He has his theatrics down, with the right dramatic intonation and high-class diction, but his acting is dead set on \\"desperate soliloquy\\" mode. This serves him well on \\"Second Skin\\" and \\"Paper Tigers,\\" but his voice has little range, and sounds flat, without the commanding authority of [[ASIN:B000042O1H Ian Curtis]], the flexibility of Robert Smith, or the warmth of [[ASIN:B0000E2PY6 Ian McCulloch]] or [[ASIN:B000YPMQ8K Paul Simpson]]. I was somewhat reminded of the guy from [[ASIN:B000ENC7KY Wire]], if the latter had taken one theatre course.    Burgess wrote a set of lyrics to match. Every song is a grandiose display of angst, expressed in hyper-dramatic but totally unsubtle ways, e.g. \\"I surmise I'm less than human in God's eyes.\\" On one hand, there's the ornate vocabulary (\\"surmise\\"!); on the other, there's the simple chant-like song structure. And yes, \\"Monkeyland\\" even features the line, \\"is there anyone here who understands me, anyone at all?\\" It's fortunate that the music is there to tip the scales. The droning power of the guitars often overwhelms the vocals, so that they are only half-discernible. I think it's for the better, allowing the album to create a mournful atmosphere, awintry landscape that only occasionally comes into focus around the singer, who is unfortunately not strong enough to carry the album by himself.    This is a seasonal album, best suited for wintertime. If you're able to appreciate droning, ringing guitars and melancholy atmosphere, it's for you. In fact, it may help if you're already a connoisseur of post-punk, since you'll be better able to discern the ways in which Script Of The Bridge stands out from the rest. This particular style of music is able to create a faraway, dreamlike mood better than any other.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|As all Twilight fans will know, part 3 was great! It just keeps getting better. Packaged well and plays great. Must see!
B00127RAJY|5.0|So far so good.  Trying to get back into shape.  Jillian keeps you motivated and focused.  Other dvds seem so cheesy.  This one I know that I will stick with.  Would recommend.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Never though the movie could have a great story line after the other two Toy Stories but Pixar did it again..Cute story with funny character lines.
B000BB1MIC|3.0|Order received in a timely manner.  Package rattled as if broken.  It was a gift but carefully opened the wrapper and found the rattling to be from the plastic casing not the Discs themselves.  The DVDs appeared fine, and have not heard of any viewing problem.  No return information or receipt of any kind was included in the package.  Overall okay experience.
B001GQSY64|5.0|I have both Seasons 1 & 2 Clone Wars so far and love them<br />[[ASIN:B001PO53IO Star Wars The Clone Wars: The Complete Season One (TV Series) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TLMPHI Star Wars: The Clone Wars - The Complete Season Two [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />This movie was the prelude to the series, I know alot of supposed \\"Diehard\\" fans of the original Trilogy love bashing the series and this movie, well I'm a 48 yr old \\"Diehard\\" fan who actually enjoys animation and Sc-fi, so I really like the movie, lots of action and adventure, The quality of the animation and effects are excellent the Video presentation is top notch and the audio is superb to me.<br /><br />Although I dont get to watch the series on TV all the time I do get to catch up with it on the BluRay and DVD's I own...The 3rd season looks to be the best so far!<br /><br />Remember this is \\"Animation\\" and Sci-fi so just sit back and enjoy it!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I'll admit the first time I listened to the CD I asked myself, What the hell is this?! I guess I was still expecting things like blood, ghosts, funerals, and just your basic MCR stuff. I wanted to hear things like their old work but was surprised by the new things they brought out. I had to listen more than once to appreciate it and now I can't stop listening to the CD. It's amazing, of course Gerard's voice has always been, but you need to listen to it more than once to really appreciate it. And as always MCR has surprised me with their amazing talent and thanks to my open mind I can still appreciate their hard work and amazing talent.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|To be honest, I usually don't care much for these types of shows, but there is something very captivating about this particular series, so much so that my husband and I watched 4 hours straight without even realizing it. It is great to be able to see animals and places most of us will never get to see otherwise.  I will note for those of you who have seen this show in the US, the narrator is Sigourney Weaver when shown on TV, on this set it is a British narrator.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A book that is slow at first but if you stick through it you will be greatly rewarded with a fantastic novel about adventure, love, and action. An epic read for ANYONE. teehee ;]
0446563048|3.0|This was a great book.  I enjoyed reading it from cover to cover, but I feel that a lot of things were left out..... like the long days people put in to get the company up and running.  The theme of the book is if you work hard, play fair, great things will happen.  While I feel that is partially true, I think that a lot of the hard work that was put in was left out of the book.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Our baby loves listening to Enya in the car. It is the only music that will stop him from screaming and lull him to sleep when we are in the car. We purchased this album for him for his first Christmas, and it did not disappoint. We listened to this album during our 6.5 hour drive to see family out of state, and all three of us enjoyed the music.
0439023521|5.0|I am an avid reader and I have loved many books, but this is the first one that has captured me so intently that I wanted to write a review.  The Hunger Games was a Christmas present that I haven't been able to put down since.  I finished the book then proceeded to read it from the beginning all over again.  The characters in this book are so rich, well-rounded, and courageous.  The subject matter could be disturbing to some people, but I think part of the beauty of the book is the honesty in which it portrays humans - from our capacity to hurt one another to our capacity for love, compassion, and loyalty.<br /><br />My birthday is coming up soon and I have asked for the other 2 books as a present, but I honestly don't know if I can wait that long to continue with this engaging and meaningful story.  I am as conflicted now as I was reading the book...  I simultaneously want to devour the story greedily and savor all of the sweet and bitter notes as slowly as possible to make them last.<br /><br />This is a story I won't soon forget.  I can't do justice to the plot, so I won't try to recap it.  All I can recommend is that you let Suzanne Collins walk you through the story she has artfully weaved because you will enjoy every minute!  I will definitely be recommending this book to everyone I know from my mother to my grandmother to my friends and husband.  This book has the ability to appeal to every type of person I can imagine.  I am usually not a fan of science fiction or fantasy books, but I'm not even sure that this book can be put into one category or another.  It is just a great book all around.  Prepare yourself to be addicted!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have never really been a Jillian Michaels fan per se, but after reading a bunch of reviews for this on a few fitness forums, I decided to give it a try.  One day down, and I definitely feel the burn! Michaels' 3-2-1 technique (3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute abs) works you out pretty hard in a short 20 minute workout. That being said, there are really only two things I really don't like about this video.     First, Jillian seems really clunky in her delivery and instruction and the transitions between moves isn't smooth or fun like other videos I've purchased. Secondly, the music is TERRIBLE!! I've only done the first level workout, but if you're like me, the music is a huge motivating factor.  It's incredibly hard to find the rhythm of the moves as the workout doesn't fit the music (an obnoxious 80s-inspired techno-house loop) and I found myself struggling to meet the same move count of the video because it was lacking a smooth flow with a solid downbeat.      However, Jillian is great at motivating you in the tough spots of the workout (you know you want to give up on those crunches, but she tells you about that knot in your stomach right before it happens) and she does have some variations for those less advanced worker-outers.  I recommend this video, even if you have to put on your own soundtrack to do it! It's a great workout.
B002RV01QI|4.0|This has many of Enya's popular tracts on it.  I am not a big fan of hers and this is the first album I have purchased.  I enjoy listening to her style and the way she creates music with voices as well as instruments.  The songs here are lyrically silly at times and the tone, and tempo of most of the tracts are lighthearted and up beat.  I will probably buy more of her music because of the songs on this album.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Excelente pack, lo recib&iacute; el 24 de diciembre y no me canso de exhibirlo en mi colecci&oacute;n. Ver esta pel&iacute;cula de acci&oacute;n en Bluray es espectacular, la versi&oacute;n DVD es muy buena y el digital COPY lo tengo en mi NOKIA N8 ya instalado y par de amigos del trabajo se sorprenden de la calidad. Aqu&iacute; en Venezuela no entienden mucho de eso de DIGITAL COPY, como todo se consigue PIRATA pues piensan que me la he copiado y ripiado de una manera especial a mi celular, pero es tan simple como colocar un codigo, bajarla a la PC y poner el archivo en el celular.<br /><br />Recomiendo este pack de acci&oacute;n verdadera, explosiones, armas y peleas &uacute;nicas. Viva Stallone y larga vida!!!

B000BCE918|5.0|I got this box set for my son for Christmas and he was extremely excited to receive the gift (and I was excited to watch these movies again - I own Jurassic Park on VHS and have always loved the film).  Although these are DVDs, I do play them on my Blu-Ray player and my HDTV - and all 3 Jurassic Park park movies have never looked and sounded so good, except maybe on the big screen.  If you have a young child that loves dinosaurs, like I do, this Jurassic Park Adventure Pack is a must.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I was in school when these albums first came out in the 60's and bought them in mono--which I still own--and didn't realize until I bought them in stereo years later how different they were.  When they announced that the Beatles albums were being re-released I had hoped that they'd release them in mono as well.  The result is incredible.  Rubber Soul, Revolver, and the White Album were the albums I looked forward to the most in mono because of the different mixes from the stereo but the rest of the albums are even better than the original on vinyl.  The sound is big and full almost like you're listen to a live performance.  Sgt Pepper's & Magical Mystery Tour are much better in mono than stereo.  I was also surprised at how the first albums that were originally release in mono sound even better.  They have a cleaner fatter sound than they did.  I've got those albums on CD from when they were released the first time and this new set is much better. Most of the music produced in the 60's sounded hollow in stereo. Where these albums capture the true intent of the sound.  On CD the sound is deeper than on vinyl.  I'm a vinyl junkie but this time CD has out down itself.  If you're too young to have not had the experience of mono recordings this is one collection you need to pick up on.  I'd like to see other albums from the 60's that were released in mono & stereo re-released in mono.  I've got the Dylan mono set on order and looking forward to that as well.  Thanks to Apple for the treat of hearing this great music again the way it should be heard.  Will Beeley
B003UBTX7C|1.0|This was one hard read and not easy to get through. There wasnt a bad guy to hate till very late and even then, the bad guy wasnt believable. And what was the deal with Chapman at the end?  Sorry, you lost a reader with this one.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|Really enjoyed how Emma and Dexter's lives intertwined all those years.  The author made them come alive to me.  I was unable to put the book down once I started.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|After reading the reviews from others, I was expecting more.  Although I understand that the author was trying to take us in to the trauma for both Jack and Ma, I grew weary of the dialog and the road to nowhere.  There were absolutely no surprises, just a long journey to the end of the book
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I liked the 2nd season.  It will be interesting to see if the show lasts with its move to Friday.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|i bought this for my kindle because of all the hype, got about 24% of the way through and returned it. To sum up the whole 24%, she gets divorced, is depressed, learns italian in rome and eats a lot of gelatos. this book is full of useless rambling and whining. i wouldn't recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />i will say that i'm very pleased that i was able to return it. i got a credit to my account within minutes and customer service was very nice.
0393072231|4.0|Lewis skillfully both tells a story and explains topics in \\"The Big Short\\". The opinion that I have after reading this book is that the subprime crisis was caused by a) the rating agencies doing a careless job rating subprime mortgage bonds and b) finance companies not themselves bothering to evaluate the riskiness of subprime mortgage bonds, and taking on faith what the rating agencies said. Both of these problems were caused by having the wrong incentives. The rating agencies were making money by rating all of these subprime mortgage bonds, and people on Wall Street were making loads of money by selling and buying these (using other people's money but getting bonuses).  There was also a big problem of moral hazard in subprime lending: people who got subprime mortgages with a fixed low teaser rate for the first two years would not be able to pay the higher floating rate that came after two years unless the value of the house had increased, but there was an incentive for people to sell mortgages and not to care about whether the borrower would default after two years.    A lesson this book teaches is that diversification does not magically get rid of risk. A bunch of mortgages around the country might very well be closely correlated and all tend to fail together, but it seems that people who bought CDOs made out of a mish-mash of mortgage bonds assumed that being spread out was enough to get rid of correlation. \\"In a CDO you gathered one hundred different mortgage bonds- usually, the riskiest, lower floors of the original tower- and used them to erect an entirely new tower of bonds. The innocent observer might reasonably ask, What's the point of using floors from one tower of debt simply to create another tower of debt?... The long answer was that there were huge sums of money to be made, if you could somehow get them re-rated as triple-A, thereby lowering their perceived risk, however dishonestly and artificially.\\" (p. 73) And, \\"A CDO, in their view, was essentially just a pile of triple-B-rated mortgage bonds. Wall Street firms had conspired with the rating agencies to represent the pile as a diversified collection of assets, but anyone with eyes could see that if one triple-B subprime mortgage went bad, most would go bad, as they were all vulnerable to the same economic forces.\\" (p. 129)    Lewis gives a nice explanation of synthetic CDOs on pp. 72-73. He explains how credit default swaps are really just like mortgages. If I enter into a credit default swap with you, then you get a stream of payments from me (like mortgage payments) but you are on the line to lose a lump sum if the mortgages it's based on default (like how a lender loses a lump sum if house values decline and a borrower defaults). Thus having CDSs let the same original mortgage deal be repeated.    The first three chapters introduce the cast of characters and shows some of the qualities of their characters that let them think differently than most of Wall Street. Steve Eisman and his crew are introduced in the first chapter, Michael Burry is introduced in the second chapter, and Greg Lippmann is introduced in the third chapter. Each of these players is outside the mainstream in some way. Eisman was highly opinionated and was not shy about voicing his iconoclastic opinions to important people. Eisman had experience with crappy subprime loans and with deceptive lending (by Household Finance Corp.) from earlier in his career. \\"I did subprime first. I lived with the worst first. These guys lied to infinity. What I learned from that experience was that Wall Street didn't give a s*** what it sold.\\" (p. 24) Burry was more intellectually pure than the typical people in finance and did the yeoman work that other analysts ought to have been doing. He was also aware of how much incentives affect human behavior. His investing was directed by doing research and figuring out what things were worth, rather than hoping to take a ride on an expanding bubble. He says \\"Sometimes markets err big time\\" (p. 54) As for Lippmann, \\"But when you cleared away the controversy around Lippmann's persona you could see it was rooted in two simple complaints. The first was that he was transparently self-interested and self-promotional. The second was that he was excessively alert to the self-interest and self-promotion of others. He had almost a freakish ability to identify shadowy motives.\\" (p. 64)    That this might be a storytelling device notwithstanding, the heroes of the story are portrayed as reflective, philosophical, and restrained in their animal impulses, while those involved in subprime lending are portrayed as not restraining their animal impulses. Indeed the people on Wall Street were smart. But they focused their intelligence on taking part in a feeding frenzy. (p. 74)    Unless one wants to read about John Paulson specifically, one would be better off reading \\"The Big Short\\" than reading Zuckerman's \\"The Greatest Trade Ever\\". It is odd however to see John Paulson's name mentioned so seldom in \\"The Big Short\\". He comes up in the Prologue on p. xviii, pp. 105-108 and p. 198.
1400052173|5.0|Loved this - talked about it constantly with my family and find myself thinking about it now that I'm done. Reminds me of two other non-fiction books I loved which add the human element to stories of science, medicine, race, class, ethics, history and families - \\"Random Family\\" and \\"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down.\\"
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I guess, maybe if you're a guy you might like it, but then again maybe not. My husband threw it in the donate pile. He wasn't even interested in watching it twice. What a waste of money, and we like those guys!    Its story plot was stupid. The mercenaries go back after the girl to \\"save\\" her, and in so doing redeem something of themselves. The father-daughter relationship was unemotional, why bother? It's also ridiculous that a traitor, who is trying to kill them, would be welcome back with open arms. The grand finale kept going on and on and on... It was kill, beat, blow-up and repeat, and repeat, etc. And of course, our hero's walk away with barely a scratch. Totally lame movie!
0061703087|2.0|Prey is definitely not one of Michael Crichton's better works.  The science is there but the fiction makes it a bit ridiculous.  Only a few days for a bunch of nano-particles to evolve into full symbiotic pirates on human bodies?  Give me a break.  If that happened in three days then ants would rule the world from giant ant cities ruled by massive distributed intelligence beings.  Crichton doesn't convince us that 20 lines of code in a nano-particle is better than an ant.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has many demensions and is full of suspense. The premise is incredible; and for me, hard to get over until I am well into the first book. Although I appreciate the outcome in the third book,  I feel the author changes her writing style to wrap up the series. Instead of writing in detail as she does throughout the book, it seems she just uses point by point references to wrap up this marvelous tale. It brings up many thought provoking topics that could lead to hours of dicussion.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Capturing both an intelligent story and an action-packed 3rd act, this is one of Christopher Nolan's best. And if you're familiar with such titles as The Dark Knight, the Prestige, Memento and Batman Begins, that is saying something.    Just watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B0042RJWTC|3.0|I bought the series at the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers was an amazing Henry VIIIth.  He is so regal so effortlessly that he brings instant credibility to his role. I didn't mind the poetic license used in some parts of the series (even though I am an English history buff).    My rating of 3 stars is because of the difficulties encountered in Series 2 and 3 with the discs.  There was some flaw in those two sets that prevented the DVD player from moving on to the last episode on the disc.  The last episode couldn't even be accessed by choosing it from the episode menu.  After some experimentation, I found that I could access the last episode on the discs by using the scene forward button and getting to it from the second last episode on the disc.  For shame, techno geeks.  Other than that, the packaging is pretty and ingenious.
B0042816YK|2.0|After all the hype I was looking forward to a movie about spiritual growth but this is just another hollywood movie about getting your man.  Don't waste your time.
0451228375|5.0|Once I started reading, it was very hard to put the book down.  Like the previous book, Pillars of the Earth, you are there with the characters and live every moment with them.  Amazing author, I already have 2 more of his books sitting on my dresser waiting to be read.  I think I have a new Favorite Author in Ken Follett.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It proves that you can have a family-friendly movie without dumbing down the content.  This thing is totally kid-safe but it is NOT written for children.  It doesn't simplify matters.  The plot is simple, but the characters are complex.  This movie doesn't condescend, and I found that to be incredibly refreshing.  Another neat thing I noticed is the movie's \\"timelessness.\\"  The stop-motion animation is technically impressive (masterfully done; some of the best I've seen) but it gives a nostalgic, almost antique look to the production.  It's not slick CG-rendered stuff; it looks old.  I think this movie is going to date extremely well, since it does not seem to be strongly tied to the present.  I expect it to be just as good twenty years from now as it is today.  There are no fart jokes, no incongruous pop-culture or current-event references, no contemporary Top 40 singles embedded in the soundtrack.  It's very clean, very self-contained within its own world.  I consider that a plus.    The humor is that sort of understated, character-driven style that fans of Wes Anderson will appreciate.  The voices are not typical animation-style performances, but it all works extremely well, making the characters convincing and relatable.  The pacing is fast, but it feels slow because of what the director chooses to spend time on.  Overall a very quirky and surprisingly enjoyable experience.    Older adults will enjoy the story and the interaction of the characters.  Very young children will be captivated by the cute talking animals.  However, it's likely that kids 10 - 16 years old will find this movie terribly boring (re the absence of fart jokes and \\"cool\\" stuff as mentioned above.)  It's unique and extremely smart - maybe too smart to appeal to the demographic that animated films are generally _supposed_ to be for.  Fans of animation as an art form MUST add this to their collections.  I hate to use the phrase \\"instant classic\\" but I have never seen a film more deserving of that epithet.  INSTANT CLASSIC!
0553150367|5.0|First of all, try to get the 1978 Bantam Books edition with nice, quaint line drawing illustrations by Donald Chaffin (ISBN 978-0553150360) rather than the newer editions with Quentin Blake's sketchy skewed drawings. Donald Chaffin's illustrations match the look and feel of the new classy film with George Clooney. Amazon is selling used copies, and I obtained one in nearly perfect condition for like $6.<br /><br />I love this book. It was an undiscovered gem to me, a longtime Roald Dahl fan! If you liked the movie, you'll like this book. It's shorter than some of his other books - it took me an evening to finish, and reading it to the kids would take one or two nights. It's classier, cleverer, and funnier than some of the others. Highly recommended. My kids love it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I finally watched this much-maligned movie this week (only 10 years late!) after missing it in theaters because of the hype beforehand and the vitriolic condemnation it got from all my friends.  I don't see what all the fuss was about.  It's a standard run-of-the-mill big budget product from the late-1990s Hollywood Crap Factory, long on action and spectacle... and miserably deficient in everything else.  It was actually more entertaining than I expected, based on how badly it was panned by everybody I know.  But then again, I hadn't invested my entire emotional well-being in unrealistic hopes for this movie.  If you pretend that you don't know anything about Star Wars and Episode I is your first experience of it, then the movie is okay.    Unfortunately I DO know something about Star Wars, and just \\"okay\\" is not hardly enough.  The difference between this and the original trilogy is in the writing - and mainly in character development.  None of the characters in Episode I are developed AT ALL.  I have no sense of who they are or what might be their motivations; they are just people reciting dialogue.  I know practically nothing more about Obi-Wan Kenobi than I knew before watching this.  The supposedly \\"bad mofo\\" villain Darth Maul is not even a character - he's a stunt dummy.  I think he said a total of 10 words in the entire movie.  I have absolutely no idea who he was, where he came from, what was his purpose - he was a complete non-entity and I found myself not caring in the least about his ultimate fate.  The same goes for all the other characters.  Unlike the original trilogy, which made me know the characters and care about what happened to them, this movie made everybody seem like emotionless puppets.  The best-developed character among a cast of wooden mannequins turns out, unfortunately, to be Jar-Jar Binks.    The same lackluster quality extends also to the plot.  In Episode IV it seemed awfully important to stop the Empire because they were CLEARLY badguys with an undeniably EVIL plan.  Darth Sidious's evil scheme in Episode I is sort of inscrutable.  His behind-the-scenes machinations look like normal politics to me; shady, devious, but not obviously evil enough to make me root against the guy.  Meanwhile, Queen Amidala trots across the galaxy in a haphazard \\"I keep changing my mind\\" way which ends with the inevitable victory by the good guys (accomplished with almost childlike ease, making suspension of disbelief difficult to maintain.)  Oh, and during this journey they happen to find a child who would be totally uninteresting if we didn't already know he grows up to be Darth Vader.  And we waste about 20 minutes on an unnecessary pod race sequence.  The race was viscerally exciting but it didn't contribute to the plot in a meaningful way.    It's clear that resources which should have been invested in writing and acting were lavished instead on CG effects.  Lots of action + no emotional resonance = two hours of empty, unsatisfying eye-candy.  I suppose the filmmakers were counting on using the Force (i.e. Star Wars fans' unquestioning devotion) to carry audiences past the movie's deficiencies.  It didn't work.  George Lucas cannot take all the blame for this colossal failure to live up to his past glory, because the end credits list the names of hundreds of people involved in this production ... scores of creative individuals who had the opportunity (and the responsibility) to say \\"Wait a second, Mr. Lucas.\\"  But apparently nobody did.    Ah well.  If you lower your expectations, this movie is watchable - even enjoyable to a certain degree.  A solid 3-star product.
0783219695|4.0|I love, love, love this movie - so much, that I may know it by heart - that is why I noticed that at least 2 scenes have either been cut or shortened?  I'm referring to the 2-disc anniversary edition, IMAX Experience version - why have 2 discs and cut scenes from the movie?  One missing scene was when the NASA men enterred Gary Sinese's apartment and woke him up to take him back to Mission Control and the other scene was at re-entry, when Tom Hanks realized he was sitting in Kevin Bacon's seat, and acknowledged so. - Didn't anyone else notice these were no longer in the movie?  Perhaps even more scenes were skipped?
B00005QGAX|5.0|Where could I start?  I grew up idolizing Michael Jackson and in 1987 the year 'BAD' came out I was 16 years old and SO ready to hear another album by him!  My parents on the first day it hit stores, went to get the vinyl copy of it and a cassette copy of it for me.  I later in the year purchased the CD for I finally purchased a CD player and needed it to have 'Leave Me Alone.'  The CD was my personal anthem in High School, it was what all my friends remembered of me.  I loved it and STILL do.  My 2 youngest sons love Michael as I do.  They were sitting with me when we heard of his death and the first CD they wanted to hear in rememberence... 'Bad'  This all being said 'Bad' is a work of art.  Back in the late 80's 'Bonus Tracks' were rare and being Michael added 'Leave Me Alone' as a bonus track it enticed people to get the CD version of 'Bad.'  The title track, 'Speed Demon', & 'Dirty Diana' are my personal favorites.  'Man in the Mirror' I believe is the track most remember him of on this album.  Some critics say this is his 3rd best album, but I always have disagreed.  Though 'Bad' obviously did not get the AUORA that was 'Thriller', I think 'Bad' is his best work for ear catching hits and grooves that make you want to get up and dance.  The only track to not end up a hit, 'Just Good Friends' with Stevie Wonder is still a catchy hit none the less. That same year Stevie's hit 'Get it' with Michael was a better hit with them together.  When thinking of it what could possibly do better than the BIGGEST SELLING ALBUM of all time? 'Bad' had a lot of pressure on it as Michael tried I believe to get as close as 'Thriller.'  Though this album came out 23 years ago and I am writing a review on it, if you are one of the very few that don't own it, check it out and buy it.  It is vintage Michael from beginning track to end.

0316098337|2.0|I bought this book for Kindle because it had so many positive reviews. I read the first page or so at the bookstore and I wasn't too thrilled, but I thought it must be one of those books that gets better as you read it.     My advice is--if you liked the first couple of pages, then you might like the book. If the writing style in those first few pages annoys you, put it down and walk away. This book doesn't get better.     It's a shame too, the premise of the story is really great: a mother does her best to raise her child under extreme conditions, and does an all right job. Something just gets lost in the telling of it. Jack alternates between really mature ideas and really immature dialogue. Just a few of the MANY examples of this are: A kid who knows what \\"quinoa\\" is, but says his food \\"got hotted\\" in the microwave? Or one who can tell the difference in the voice of someone who is quoting a poem, but can't tell when someone is speaking directly to him? His mother corrects his grammar on some things, but not others, it's just frustratingly inconsistent. I get that the inconsistencies could have been on purpose, but it just seemed sloppy to me.    There was a part in the middle where I was able to ignore the writing style because the story did get pretty interesting, but after the climax it falls off hard.    It was an easy read though; I got through it in a day.
B000QFW7UA|4.0|Comes with an unique board game, a 1985 souvenir magazine reprint with cast photos of Chunk, Data the Fratelli's . The only thing was not amazing was the blu ray case an disc, they don't match with the other cool stuff.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|This  series follows the previous one to a \\"t\\".  If you followed and loved season one, this will help you complete the story.  Unfortunately the book was superior to the film.  The characters in the series are not believable and the stories are shallow.  The author actually takes much more care developing characters and relationships.  It is a must read series.
0439023483|5.0|Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm.<br /><br />When I first got this in the mail about a year or two ago, I quickly set it aside after seeing the not very alluring cover. After days went by I finally decided to try and look past the cover and see what it was about. So I did, and was still not very into wanting it on my reading list. It sounded a bit interesting, but not enough to really draw me in.<br /><br />But now, lately, I've seen this book and it's series around everywhere. I couldn't shake this series. I started reading reviews on it and all of them have been great reviews. I have not seen one bad review so far! Basically all of them are five or four stars. So I finally decided to sit down and try and read it.<br /><br />I told myself that I would read the first 10 pages before I went to bed and if it didn't catch my attention and if I didn't remember what I had read the next day, then I would set it aside again and try and read it at a later time when I was more in the mood for it.<br /><br />The next day came and I remember everything and was more interested in reading it! And I'm so glad that it caught my attention because this is one GREAT book. I can see what all the hype is about it now and why I see \\"Team Peeta\\" and \\"Team Gail\\" around everywhere! Which, by the way, I am completely \\"Team Peeta\\". Not that there is anything wrong with Gail, he's a nice character. But Peeta has me completely won over!<br /><br />I can see the meaning of the cover now and it fits with the book well. It may not be one of my favorite covers, but I appreciate it a bit more now after reading the book.<br /><br />Collins' world building is prodigious, but scary!

B0042AEOG0|2.0|This is the worse CD that was ever put out by Mariah. Her first Christmas CD is THE BEST. Love Mariah, not loving this CD.
030745455X|1.0|but it is so poorly written and cliche-ridden that I couldn't.  I gave up at about 100 pages.  I wasn't even expecting much, just the kind of bland fare for air travel that might as well be its own genre: \\"paperbacks picked up at Hudson News between flights\\".  There are so many things to dislike here, but I'll only note one.  The heroine is annoyingly perfect, inaccessible, aloof, and a genius to boot, but of course \\"different\\" (i.e. superior) from everyone else, with flaws that aren't flaws so much as badges.  Maybe Larsson was being ironic, but he created a character fully conforming to all the cliches of non-conformity.<br /><br />Unreadable garbage.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best book of the Hunger Games trilogy, it has a very abrupt ending to it though, I wish Suzanne Collins would write an epiloge to Mockingjay, it would be interesting to find out what would haapen to Katniss, Peeta, and their two children.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Ok, so I have to admit, when I saw the advertisements for this show, all I could think of was that it looked cheesy and very tween centered.  Then I saw an episode on TV, intrigued I took a look at Hulu and caught some of the second season episodes they had there.  Now, its a guilty pleasure and I just had to get the first season to see how it all started.<br /><br />Glee is a great show in that its positive.  Sure there's some mature themes in it, but really, its about life and that just makes it more realistic.  It shows overcoming obstacles and reaching for your dreams.  But most importantly, it has great music.  Glee is about the New Directions, a glee club who isn't very popular at school but enjoys each other's company and can put on quite the show.

She gives the other members a hard time and is sometimes vicious.<br /><br />Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is another of Sue's spies but cannot perform the task adequately as she is a complete airhead.  She's a great dancer and often unintentionally provides comic relief for the group.<br /><br />Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is the school's guidance counselor.  She has extreme OCD and during most of the season has a crush on Will that in some parts is returned.

He is a love interest for several of the group's girls.<br /><br />Will Schuester (Mark Morrison) is the glee club director and Spanish teacher.  He has a good heart but doesn't always listen to the kid's on what they want.  But he learns quickly and always tries to do his best for them.  A former Glee club member himself, he is a great singer and dancer.  He has a lot of love interests and has trouble with relationships.<br /><br />Terry Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) is Will's neurotic wife.  Originally seen as controlling and bossy, she mellows out when trying to hide a secret from Will.  She cannot overcome her jealousy and suspicion however and does not add to the relationship very much.<br /><br />Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is definitely the nemesis of the Glee Club.  Head of the vastly awarded Cheerio's she is upset that Will's club is cutting into her budget.  She'll stop at nothing to destroy the New Directions.  She does have moments where her inner goodness shines out however, and it keeps the audience guessing.<br /><br />Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr) is a football player who is also a great dancer.

He's a bit confused about how to do right for his gay son, but ultimately loves him and wants the best for him.<br /><br />Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) is the head of the school paper and has an extreme crush on Rachel.

He was removed for inappropriate conduct and is later used for comic relief and the selling of illegal drugs.<br /><br />Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) is the coach of the school teams.

He causes problems at times but ultimately is just a guy who wants to be loved.<br /><br />Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) is the coal of the rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline.  She is also Rachel's biological mother.<br /><br />Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) is the lead singer of Vocal Adrenaline.  For a time he is a love interest of Rachel's before becoming a rival again.<br /><br />April Rhodes (Kristin Chenowenth) is a washed up former glee club member who never finished high school.  After a stroke of good luck and some help from Will she ends up rich and helps out the glee club.<br /><br />There are many other characters, but most play minor roles.<br /><br />As a whole I think they did a great job of casting the characters.  They also included some cameos such as Josh Groban and Olivia Newton John and also Neil Patrick Harris.  There were some characters that I just didn't care for however.  I'm not a big fan of the Emma Pillsbury character.  I realize she's a love interest for Will but I think her arc in the story takes a lot away from the show's true purpose; the glee club.  She also, despite her eccentricities, just isn't that interesting and I can't see why Will would be interested in her.  The same would go for her boyfriend in the series, Ken Tanaka.  He makes things hard for Will and the football players, but aside from that, doesn't add too much.<br /><br />Most of the characters I love though.  Artie is fantastic and you really feel compassion for him especially in the episode on dancing.  Sue Sylvester is great.  She plays the perfect villain and I can never tell what she's going to do next.  All of the Glee club members really know how to put on a show.<br /><br />Episodes:<br /><br />The First Season has 22 episodes and they are all jam-packed with music, dancing, and your soap opera-ish type plot lines that seem to be popular.<br />**Warning, some of these episode descriptions could be considered spoilers for plot lines.<br /><br />Pilot:<br />This introduces us to the gang and also to the formidable Will Scheuster, a Spanish teacher, former glee club member, and the new director of the Glee club.  The group largely consists of outcasts and starts only five members strong.  But they've got talent, it just needs to be explored.  We are also introduced to Will's formidable wife Terry and the guidance counselor who has a crush on him, Emma Pillsbury.<br /><br />Shomance:<br />In order to try to get some new members (and not be slushied in the face) the group puts together a number to sing in front of the whole school.  Will takes on some new responsibility since he has learned Terri is pregnant, but she isn't telling him the whole truth. Glee Club's Arch Nemesis Sue Sylvester (coach of the award winning Cheerio's cheer squad) sends some cheerleaders as spies into the glee club.<br /><br />Acafellas:<br />Will forms an all male vocal group and in doing so gives up some responsibility to the glee club.  They hire a dance instructor, but realize that they just need to accept each other for who they are.  Especially Kurt as he struggles with his sexuality.<br /><br />Preggers:<br />In this episode, Kurt comes out of the closet, but also joins the football team. Quinn tells Finn that he is the father of her baby and they have to decide what they are going to do with their future despite the fact that she knows Puck is actually the father.  The Glee club also helps the football team win a game.<br /><br />The Rhodes Not Taken:<br />With Rachel quitting to perform in the school play, Will enlists former glee member April Rhodes to be in the glee club.  As she never graduated high school, she is still able to do this.  While struggling to overcome April's bad influence on the group and competing at sectionals, the glee clubbers have a lot on their plate.<br /><br />Vitamin D:<br />After their success at Invitationals, the team feels too confident to perform adequately so Will has the girls compete against the boys.  However, Terri, newly appointed as the school nurse gives the kids over the counter drugs to help them pep up and ultimately gets them in even more trouble.<br /><br />Throwdown:<br />With Sue as co-director of the Glee club, things couldn't be more tense.  She tries to pit the group against each other and then the group becomes even more disheveled when its revealed to the rest of the school that Quinn is pregnant.<br /><br />Mash-Up:<br />When asked to come up with a way to mash two very unlikely song together for Emma and Ken's wedding, Will has to struggle with his feelings for Emma.  These aren't the only relationship problems in this episode as Finn, Quinn, Rachel, and Puck all have to deal with their feelings as well.<br /><br />Wheels:<br />When its revealed how hurt Artie is that he can't travel with the rest of the group they try to raise money to rent a wheelchair accessible school bus for him to take to regionals.  Artie learns something unexpected about Tina, and Sue shows her softer side.<br /><br />Ballad:<br />Will assigns the group a task to sing ballads to each other about how they feel.  This results in a lot of secrets being exposed and Finn telling Quinn's parents about her pregnancy.<br /><br />Hairography:<br />When they see their competition for regionals (and Will is subsequently impressed by their use of hair in dance) they all don the wings and have a rockin time using \\"Hairography\\" in their routines.  Quinn considers putting the baby up for adoption.<br /><br />Mattress:<br />After a big uproar about the team not appearing in the yearbook Rachel finds a way to try to make them popular again by starring in a local Mattress company commercial.  This compromises them however, as they are paid in mattresses and this could disqualify them from competition.  Will discovers Terri has been lying to him about her pregnancy and spends the night at the school.<br /><br />Sectionals:<br />With Will stepping down from coaching the club, Emma postpones her wedding to take the team to sectionals where they learn that their set-list as been leaked to the opposing teams.

Kurt struggles with his identity and begins dating Brittany.<br /><br />Dream On:<br />When Will's old rival in glee club Bryan Ryan wants to cut Glee from the school budget, he has to give up some of his dreams in order to keep it going.  Artie also has to come to term with his dreams of being a dancer.<br /><br />Theatricality:<br />This episode pays homage to Lady Gaga and all her craziness.  Rachel meets her mother and Kurt and Finn's families move in together creating tension.<br /><br />Funk:<br />After feeling a bit defeated by Vocal Adrenaline, a competing team, Will teaches the glee club that they have funk and soul.  Rachel is also devastated when Jesse returns to Vocal Adrenaline.<br /><br />Journey:<br />The team's performance at Regionals will determine their future in the school.  However, they've just learned that Sue is one of the judges and are feeling depressed.  Quinn goes into labor.<br /><br />As a whole the episodes are great and I enjoy the music.  I should note however that some of the plot lines tend to get stale and drawn out.  They also focus more on some characters than others and while the tension between Rachel and Finn is interesting, it just gets boring after awhile.  Some of the more minor characters have great back stories and I'd love to see it expanded.<br /><br />Some of the story lines were quite touching though.  Quite a few timse there were moments in the show that I could feel tears coming to my eyes.  Now that's good writing!<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />Since this is Glee I have to talk about the music.  The show uses a mix of modern tunes and old classics and of course show tunes.  They use Madonna, Lady Gaga, Journey, and other popular artists in their works.  The actors do their own singing but it is slightly noticeable that it is prerecorded.<br /><br />I did enjoy most of the music but thought they got a little heavy handed with the show tunes and broadway hits once in awhile.  Its not that they're not good songs, I just thought the performances and singing for the modern hits were much better done and also better coreographed.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />This is a great family friendly tv series.  While it explores some mature themes (teen pregnancy, virginity, drugs, etc.) it does so in an approachable way and a parent can easily sit and explain right choices to their kids while watching.  But its also entertaining for adults.  There are plot lines that keep it interesting and music to keep you entertained.  While I would love to see more music there's only so much they can fit into an hour long episode.  Fantastic series and I highly recommend watching it.<br /><br />Review by M.

B000YDI9UG|5.0|These are an amazing pair of boots from Timberland, just as what you would expect from the boot company.  I have another pair of Chukkah boots from Timberland and love them, resulting in my purchase in these.  The Earthkeepers extremely stylish and can be worn with any style of pants from straight to boot cut jeans to khakis.  These boots are made with extremely high quality as well, with tough waterproof leather and great soles.  Even the shoelaces are sturdy!  I use these as a winter/cold weather boot for snow as they reach about 3-4 inches above my ankles, compared to the Chukkahs which end at the ankle, and they serve the purpose well!    The only downside is the leather is a bit rough and will take some time to break in, about 4-5 wears for me, but they feel great once you do.  I also had the fear that the leather would get scuffed and scratched, but any minor scratches make the boots look much more vintage and worn in, a definite plus.    Overall, I would recommend you buy these Earthkeepers if you are looking for a great pair of boots at an affordable price.  The quality and style make them an amazing value, and you can't go wrong with Timberlands.

0525423273|5.0|Imagine you're seventeen, and about to start your senior year of high school. You have a loyal best friend, your own car and a budding crush on a cute guy in a band. Life is pretty good, until your parents inform you they are sending you to boarding school in Paris, France. Not only do think it will broaden your horizons, but also teach you to be responsible and independent. Well, if it was me I would jump at the chance to live in the most romantic city in the world. But I've always been a fan of Paris. Anna on the other hand, is not so thrilled at the idea of leaving everyone and everything behind for nine months. After all, a lot can happen in almost a year's time...<br /><br />During her first week at her new school, Anna makes some friends. One of them happens to be the very attractive, very unavailable Etienne St. Claire. Not only is this gorgeous boy with the French name American, but he also speaks with an English accent. St. Claire as everyone refers to him, quickly becomes close with Anna. He helps her with her French and acts as her Parisian tour guide. As time passes Anna starts to develop feelings for St. Claire and even though it seems like he returns those feelings, his girlfriend is still a factor. But who said love was ever convenient?<br /><br />I'm not sure how to talk about this book without sounding like a gushing teenager. I had a hunch I would like this story, especially since it takes place in Paris. But it was one of those books that once it had me, it really had me. Anna and St. Claire had a very sweet friendship, they were there for one another no matter what. They had a chemistry that was undeniable, and with each page I turned I hoped I was getting closer to them finally being together. St. Claire is the kind guy that every girl wants to find. He's cute, worldly, charming and above all genuine. I wanted to jump into Anna's shoes just so I could be there with him. When she would describe leaning over and smelling his hair or the sensation she got when their legs touched in a dark movie theater, I could almost feel what she was feeling.<br /><br />I loved this book so much because it was different then anything else I've read. No vampires, or werewolves, or other supernatural beings. Just a girl in love with a boy. If it were made into a movie I would see it over and over again. Stephanie Perkins is a cool, fresh new author and I will be eager to read anything she writes!ir legs touched in a dark movie theater, I could almost feel what she was feeling.

B003VVS67Y|3.0|This is a sampler disc featuring selections from longer works offered on other discs. I have the Vol. 1 disc which I have enjoyed several times but this one is a different story. Although some of the performances are really good, the ballet solo from Sylvia being a case in point, some of the selections are very esoteric.<br /><br />I cannot really recommend this disc to anyone; the selections performed range from good to strange, the video is great but the audio has some bloated bass in a couple of selections that had me checking my speaker calibration all over again (the calibration checked out which led to me believe the bloat was on the disc).<br /><br />If the selections interest you the price is low enough to minimize the risk but I'll admit it will be a long time before I put that disc on again.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|Josh Groban has always set the bar exceedingly high. His magnificent  voice, gorgeous orchestral arrangements and passionate renditions are without rival on today's music scene.  So, it was with high expectations that I purchased this cd, as all his previous offerings have been stellar.  However, on this cd, he heads in in an entirely different direction, and overall, the result is inconsistent and dissatisfying.      On the one hand, his performance on the operatic \\"L'ora Dell Addio is impressive.  If you didn't know it was his own music, you would think it was lifted right out of a Puccini opera.  Groban's lyrical melody and phrasing are stunningly beautiful and heartfelt, his vocal technique is better here than on the other song selections, and his emotional connection to the music is an inspiration.  Even if you don't like opera, you have to respect his aritistic excellence.  But, I dislike the production manipulation which was done to remove most of the resonance in his voice. That eliminated so much of its power and splendor and was not appropriate for such an intense operatic setting.  On the other hand, the few other foreign language selections on this cd are not memorable.  There are definite flaws in his vocal technique, especially evident on the brazillian song, where his voice is not properly focused and becomes breathy with almost no tone on the high notes.  I know he receives classical instruction, so it is worrisome to me that after all this time his voice has not improved, and sounds rather worse.  He really needs to go back to classic vocal basics and address these issues if he wants to perserve the exceptional God given gift he has.      The majority of the tracks are stylistically much more folk inspired, and while the lyrics are often passionate, poetic and personal, musically, the songs often lack cohesiveness and don't successfully convey the emotional depth of his message nor do they showcase his amazing voice.  One song in particular \\"Love Only Knows\\" is so structurally disjointed that musically it falls just short of being downright chaotic.  Also, his constant use of falsetto is distracting.  I am not sure if he is intentionally singing in this voice for stylistic reasons or if it is indicative of poor vocal technique which has affected his range. Either way, the overall sound is not pleasing to the ear. His voice sounds strained and labored when singing full voice in his upper range, especially on If I Walk Away. Overall, these new songs simply don't measure up to the caliber of songs like \\"Remember when It Rained\\", or \\"Awake\\", both collaborative efforts from his previous Closer and Awake cds respectively.   I do commend him, however, for his courage to be genuine and honest.  His willingness to share his own inner truths is refreshing and poignant and gives the listener a much clearer insight into who he is.      My advice to potential buyers would be to listen to samples of the music prior to purchase if possible and make your own assessment.  If that isn't possible, be prepared for an entirely different style.  I would have liked to give this cd a higher rating, and had the album had a better balance stylistically, a higher level of songwriting and had he exhibited a more beautiful tone quality reminiscent of his earlier cds, I would have happily done so.  As one of the rare artists who can captivate a listener, drawing them into his music and connecting with them on a deeply emotional level, Groban is in a class by himself.  It's a shame there are so few moments on this album where thatcan truly be experienced.
B0043UGKAM|5.0|Simply put, I think this is one of the best adult series on any network!  It has all of the ingredients one could look for in a drama: politics, betrayal, love, sex, nudity and violence; all in appropriate amounts.  I am sure the writers have taken some artistic license when depicting some things surrounding life in Rome, and I did initially think the special effects with the blood was over-the-top.  With that said, every episode transports one to Rome and the life and times of Spartacus.  The writing is amazing and the acting is top-notch!  The first two or three episodes are the foundation episodes, and the story builds from there.  If you liked the HBO series Rome...you will love Spartacus Blood and Sand.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I love Josh Groban.  I have everything he has recorded.  ON this new release his voice is as good as ever, I'm just not as fond of the selection of songs.  I know everyone has done it but he needs to record a Broadway CD
B00377V6J2|5.0|This is one of the best ever blues performances caught on camera/tape.  It features the brilliant Texas guitar slinger Stevie Ray Vaughan and his mentor/idol Albert King.  The performance highlights their extraordinary, virtuoso performance and love of the blues.  Run, do not walk to buy this release, you won't be disappointed.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|The music is great just as in the film.  However, I was disappointed that there were only 10 songs on the CD.  There was a lot more music in the film and some songs were a lot longer in the film than on the CD.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is a great documentary with telling insight into the band behind the music.  I especially liked the interviews with musicians such as Billy Corgan, Les Claypool and Trent Reznor who provided their own unique insight into how Rush affected their lives and career choices as musicians.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|It arrived within a VERY reasonable amount of time. I LOVE this soundtrack! The CD was in very good shape.
B001I82RVS|5.0|If you love movies like MEATBALL MACHINE, MACHINE GIRL, etc., then TOKYO GORE POLICE belongs on your DVD shelf! This Japanese splatter classic features Eihi Shiina (AUDITION) as Ruka, a member of the title police force. She is specially trained to hunt down and kill the \\"engineers\\" (genetically-altered mutants) that threaten mankind. Ruka is also out to avenge the death of her father. Along the way, she uncovers the truth about the engineers and the TGP. Filled w/ spraying blood and flying limbs, this movie is for those of us who can laugh at such -obviously- outrageous displays, while enjoying a cool story of betrayal, conspiracy, and revenge. Much like ROBOCOP, TGP is saturated w/ biting social satire. It also has a wonderfully bleak Cronenberg air about it! Enjoy...

B0043ZDU1E|5.0|My husband and I are long time Loreena McKennitt fans and I was thrilled to see a new CD out just in time for me to purchase for Christmas.  We finally got the chance to listen to it last night and it was wonderful. Since her first album of traditional celtic music in 1985, Loreena has been exploring the roots of Celtic music mostly through her own compositions. Now she has returned to the same vein of traditional songs that she mined with her first album \\"Elemental\\". The new album is reminiscent of her first album but incorporates the lush arrangements that she perfected over the last 25 years. The result is a gratifying listening experience.

B002BGCCZC|5.0|I originally purchased this product the day it was released in stores as I've been a Muse fan for a fair while now-longer than most. I have to say, this is most definitely my favorite album of theirs. Okay, so most of their albums are my favorite, but this album is so beautiful that every song on it gives me the chills. Muse are easily one of the best bands out there. Every song is one of a kind and none sound the same (this goes for all their albums). Most artists don't have this originality and so, they continuously produce the same kind of song throughout every album. This is the band that no other can match up to. Their uniqueness is perfection and Muse are the very definition of what good music should be.
B0000640VM|4.0|I ordered this as a Christmas present. It came on time and there seemed to be no problems with the disc.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This is it!!! Feels like a pc... I love it! I dont know wat everyone else is saying but this works great and feels just like a pc... I didnt play console games because i was use to keyboard and mouse... if you want that buy this! Works perfect on Black ops!
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|I love this movie because it is for all age levels. In 3D all kinds  of activity fun to watch.
0439023483|5.0|This book will have you on your toes from page one. The setting, situations, and storyline will blow your mind. You'll be so attached to the characters at the end, you'll think about them for days. I was so stuck to the book I read it till I couldn't hold my eyes open, till I was at the point of reading it while I was cooking, and I was even tempted to pick it up at red lights!
1439190275|3.0|This book is OK - but, maybe it's me, but I can't eat as much food as this diet calls for.  I can't eat all of the things called for in each meal, let alone all of the between meal snacks.  I bought it hoping to get advice on healthy eating, but I was kind of disappointed because it seems somewhat unrealistic in how much it thinks one person can or should eat in a day.    I don't need to lose weight - I'm not skinny, but an ok weight, but wanted advice on food and felt like I could never follow this regimen.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I purchased on black friday, (awesome deal by the way, thanks amazon!!!!) while I love True blood and Amazon has been always great to ship and deliver, I gotta say Shame on you HBO, my only complain is that they compressed the videos to fit them all on 5 dvd's. Chapters 1-2 are on the first disc, 3-4 one disc as well (so far so good), but chapters 5-6-7 are on a disc and 8-9-10 were compressed to a single disc as well, so it really looks like crap. Lastly, chapters 11-12 are on a disc so it is better than 3 chapters on one cd. This is why I give it 4 stars. So basically half the show looks like crap...But other than that nothing else to complain about... I mean at least I didn't pay the full $50 it cost other people....    BTW I own the blu-ray season 2 of true blood and they did the same thing, while blu-ray is waaay better than dvd quality, you can see the picture quality is not that great on some blu-disc's, due to compression again, so know what you're getting into if purchasing these shows on dvd or blu-ray... Hopefully they'll change that for the upcoming season 3 discs...

0671042858|2.0|A girl wanders away from her family while hiking. She gets lost and through sheer determination trudges through the woods day after day trying to find her way to civilization. At night, she takes comfort in listening to her portable radio that is airing baseball games featuring MLB pitcher Tom Gordon. Eventually, she starts hallucinating and sees Tom Gordon, among other things, manifest himself into her psyche.<br />As a Steven King fan, I can confidently say that The Girl who loved Tom Gordon is not his best work. King has written non horror type stories before and I have found them very enjoyable. This one, however, just didn't do it for me. The story went flat early on and the plot wasn't strong enough to keep the pace. All in all, the story was decent. There were simply too many gaps between points of excitement.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Like many people, I am waiting for the next book in this series hoping but not counting on seeing what happens to my few favorite characters. This story moves at a geologic pace taking chapters to move inches, There is an amazing story here and deep, well filled out characters. But at this point they are being drowned in a sea of words. It might have been better to release this book together with it's other half and brutally edit them or to reconfigure it to be something that could stand on its own. Be that as it may, the author has created an amazing world and I can't wait for the next book.
0393312836|5.0|This story is about a mischievous and violent youth who gets set up by his friends and goes to prison. While there, a new rehabilitation experiment is started and scientists are choosing one of the prisoners to be the guinea pig. The main character is chosen and they reprogram his mind to feel nauseous every time he thinks about doing anything violent. He is being essentially made into a clockwork orange, organic on the outside, but programmed on the inside.   I loved this book. The story is a direct statement that people are going to be who they are meant to be and nothing should ever attempt to change that. And whatever you believe about good and evil, as human beings, we are meant to have a choice about which way we choose.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Excellent blend of actors and drawings.  Sometimes forgot this was not real characters in the Avatars sections.  Really enjoyed this.
B000127LW2|4.0|If you or a member of you family is a Star Trek Fan, or even if you aren't you would like the beginning of this series. It's nice to see a woman in the Captain's chair, it brings a fresh new outlook to the continuing saga of the Starship Enterprise.
1608870081|5.0|The pop-ups, designed by Bruce Foster, are complex and well-designed, with a nice interactive aspect: numbers on the pop-up can be matched to a list on the spread (ie: Find Dumbledor's Office.)  There are fascinating insights throughout the book regarding aspects of the filming of the Harry Potter movies, sort of a behind-the-scenes tour.  And, the art cannot be more authentic - it is by Andrew Williamson who was Concept Artist for the whole series of films.    I spent over an hour with grandchildren, ages five and ten, pouring over the book, spread by spread, taking turns reading the narratives, and matching features of the pop-ups to the numbered lists on several spreads. We were all especially delighted with the pop-up of Hogwarts School of Witchccraft and Wizardry, especially when we read that \\"J.K. Rowling described her vision of Hogwarts as 'a huge, rambling, quite scary-looking castle with a jumble of towers and battlements.'\\"  That's exactly the way it looks,\\" said the ten-year-old.  In our case, the book was a pleasure for ages five to eighty-three.
B003L77TZI|4.0|Katy puts out a fun upbeat pop album. But unless you want to explain to your kids or young teens about wanting to see a guys \\"peacock\\" and threesomes, I'd leave it out of your kids library.
0439023521|5.0|This was a great book. After I started it, I couldn't put it down. I read all three in three days. I highly recommend it and you won't be disappointed.
B0024FAG4Y|4.0|I heard from friends about how good this movie is, and it does justice from what i´ve heard, it´s even better than i thought. the reason i give four stars is because i think the picture quality for being 1080p is not as good, i know its a old movie and quality depends on the way it was filmed. this is just my opinion.
0782002064|4.0|I enjoy this movie, though not as much as other Christmas stories.  I enjoy Clarence the angel the most, but I find the multiple disappointments of George Bailey tedious.  The whole thing smacks too much of teen angst--\\"they'll be sorry when I'm gone!\\"  Although people do have many disappointments in life, these are generally not crunched together in narrative form and thus tend to depress the person living through them---and in this case us---to a lesser extent.  The next good fortune manages to mitigate the last bad luck event.  The novel prospect of seeing the world without oneself is the most entertaining part of the film.  The question for me has always been, would it really be all that different?  I have the distinct feeling that it's all about feeling sorry for ourselves, then discovering we were actually the center of the universe after all!
B00005JXY3|5.0|Miyagi and Daniel travel back to Okinawa. Hate is wrong. Miyagi practices the principle of peace, refusing to fight Sato.  Until Sato forces the issue.  Miyagi sacrifices himself for the safety of the village.  Miyagi breaking the beam of wood was electrifying.  The power of mercy is paramount.  I loved the message and power of this movie. Miyagi and Daniel redeem the viewer, a hero, and a champion of good.
B003Y3BMFW|3.0|I gave this CD to my boyfriend for Christmas...so far, he is NOT impressed.  He is hoping that the 2nd CD and video will be more to his liking.  Being a musician himself, he was surprised that the new tunes just \\"did not deliver\\"...he thought the tone was \\"dark and heavy\\".  I myself am familiar with the band's older selections and have not reviewed the new material, but trust his judgement in regard to his commentary.  We are both older \\"rock n' rollers\\" at heart, so this may be part of the dilemma.   Hope you enjoy the music regardless...we are all entitled to our opinion...Happy New Year!!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener works period.  I have used all kinds of sharpeners and this one does the job for a skinning knife, a machete, to kitchen knives.  The additional sharpening rod is a bonus for serrated blades (bread knives). Anyone can use this sharpener and get results.  It is small and easily available while skinning out any animal.  There is a lanyard hole on one end, which makes it easy to hang nearby while skinning.  Great product.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Finally a movie you can sit down as a family and watch without worrying about immoral vocabulary or scenes. Very inspirational, based on a true story.
B001O2S7XA|2.0|Called a Starter Set I first thought this was a good set to start your \\"collection\\" of Hot Wheels. Then I realized it must be like a start off ramp for the cars to take off over the floors or extended tracks. BUT, I don't know why they call it a Starter Set because once assembled as instruction shows the car/cars just go round and round in this track set. TOTALLY STUPID, and it is very noisy.     As you start this set the car \\"takes care of itself\\" and our 4-year old boy can do nothing but sit there and look at the car go round and round, there is just no interaction.    If I could I would return this product. I do like Hot Wheels just not this one.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Basically was asked to see this movie with someone so its the only reason I saw it because I am not much of a Ben Affleck fan, but after seeing this movie I was blown away, maybe it was because of my low expectations but i doubt it.  Ben did a great job directing this movie, for what this movie is about he made it worth watching.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Sorry but I didn't like this movie...I have two words to describe it: B O R I N G &<br />C O N F U S I N G!!!!
B002UJIY70|5.0|Good movie for a rental or a buy if you would like other people to see because after 1 time viewing their won't be any surprises but still worth the price if you really liked it.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|I honestly was not expecting to like this movie. I am more of a Bourne and Bond movie fan. I thought Salt looked a little too predictable and focused more on the action than any sort of story line. I was mostly incorrect.<br /><br />The story is great. Almost half way through it I was a little disappointed because I \\"thought\\" I figured out the entire plot. But Salt still had a few twists coming up. There are many flashbacks, which bring in a lot more character development and story-line understanding throughout the film.<br /><br />The acting is quite good. I am a fan of Angelina and Liev Schreiber and they both did a knockout job and worked very very well together.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are both amazing. I was very impressed with the quality.<br /><br />Salt was very entertaining throughout and kept me guessing. The speed of the film and the over-all style was great. I highly recommend Salt.
B0000DCGT4|4.0|This sequel is much better than American Pie 2 I would say it is equal to American pie. As many laugh's as the original.
B000JML7EC|4.0|I may have read this im my childhood, but I honestly don't remember. I can say that, as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Can't believe some reviewers say the blu ray version makes the CGI looks fake.  WRONG. Even in HD the CGI looks organic an as real as can possibly get.    The only fault I can find is that one piece of animation during the Banshee induction ritual looks stilted an Thats it.    Masterwork. True reference material. And a Perfect movie.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|This was the first version of Sweeney Todd I ever saw. I was introduced by a friend and fell completely in love with the music. For a year or so, I was content with the music and the movie, before I decided to see the 82 version was George Hearn and Angela Landsbury. I didn't watch it again for awhile, but decided to return to see if it was as good as I first thought. The answer, sadly, is no, it is not.<br /><br />I realize that to adapt a movie from stage to screen, changes have to take place. However, that is no excuse for cutting so many songs. Johana is reduced to a bit part, and because all of her songs with Anthony are cut, their relationship seems hollow. The wigmaker sequence,the assylum (along with the chilling City on Fire Song), and a verse from a Little Priest mysteriously disapear.<br /><br /> I can see how the Greek chorus aspect would seem cheesy on screen, but that doesn't mean the chorus had to be cut from God That's Good and Pirelli's Miracle Elixir. Also baffling his how the Johana Quartet is cut down to only three parts. the girl who played Johana had a pretty voice, and I believe she could have handled it.<br /><br />The movie is too dark, and it is hard to see what is going on. The colours (except the gushing blood) are all dull. None of the wild energy in the stage versions are here, only dreary reality. I suppose this would have been fine if Burton had been aiming for reality, but the over-the-top costumes and gore tell another story.<br /><br />Where the stage production has some very funny moments, they don't hit me as funny here. Perhaps because of the dead look of the film, or perhaps because of the singers themselves (though it doesn't help that the humorous parts are chopped down or cut out). Johnny Depp's face never changes; it seems to be stuck in a frown forever. He never sings with any real emotion, and, though at times his voice is pleasant to hear, not a note he sings is convincing or credible. Carter tries, too, but she plain can't sing. I know it's unfair to compare her to the great Angela Landsbury, but I would like at least competence. Carter seems more frazzled than insane.<br /><br />By contrast, the child who sings Toby does so better than all the rest of the cast, and Sacha Baron Cohen was a very funny Pirelli. As I said before, Johanna had a nice voice, but we didn't get to hear enough of her.<br /><br />Some parts work. The cellar was very creepy, the kid was a good actor, and at times the 'dark' colourless astmosphere work.<br /><br />I reccomend this movie to people to like movies, not to theater nuts. If you want to enjoy this movie, watch it before you see old version.n't sing. I know it's unfair to compare her to the great Angela Landsbury, but I would like at least competence.

0060936223|5.0|I bought this book as a gift to myself and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I loved Patti Smith's voice and prose.  Her description of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe came to life for me, as well as the moments in time that she captured of New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s as struggling artists.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Let me first of all say that I'm a very active girl.  I run 3 to 4 miles 3 times a week, and have worked out with free weights off and on, but she kicks my butt.  The video is simple stuff like we used to do in gym class such as jumping jacks and jumping rope.  I was sore a couple of hours after doing it.  This is a great workout, and I highly recommend it.  Even if you are a couch potato, do what you can until you build yourself up.  Like I said the moves are easy, you can do it!

B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones sound amazing from my Grace m902 headphone amplifier.  Utterly transparent, detailed, and dynamic.  Absolutely NO shortage of bass.  No artificial enhancement of bass, either -- these babies sound flat across the spectrum.  Their physical construction is a bit plasticky for me, but fine.  They are not amazingly comfortable, but nice enough to wear.    The only problem I find with them is that they are so completely involving that it's very hard for me to do anything else while listening to them.  They demand my full attention.    Another point is that these heaphones are so revealing that they will easily make apparent any flaws in the recordings you are listening to.  Pristine source material will sound perfect, but the majority of all material is full of defects, and these things will show all.  Using lesser headphones is like having dirty eyeglasses; these are crystal clear.    Finally, I want to address all of the negative reviews mentioning lack of bass and/or that a $250 pair of cans should not require an expensive amplifier.  The fact is that these are just NOT INTENDED to be driven by an iPod, an inexpensive stereo receiver, or the like.  Low-power, low-quality sources, especially battery-powered portable players like the iPod, simply do not have the juice to drive these 'phones.  To say that, at this price, they ought to work with an iPod is like saying that $1,800 racing tires should fit perfectly on a Toyota Corolla at that price.  Racing tires require big, fat rims, and these headphones require lots of clean power.    Mine are awesome, and I don't think I could do any better without spending north of $1,500.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is one of those must have dvd's for all Avatar lovers and Fans!  There are many extra, deleted, and extended scenes that were not shown in the original release.  This dvd pack is just excellent!  The graphics are Great.  One might have felt they were missing something in the original theatrical release and that's because they actually were, but after watching this extended collectors edition you'll feel filled in on what was missing and thourghly fall back in love with Avatar. Sit back and watch as you are resubmerged into the world of Pandora!
B003XKPPOU|4.0|After Mickey Mouse and Yo Gabba Gabba, Toy Story is the only other franchise my three-year-old son is familiar with. We reluctantly let him watch Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  It's interesting when you watch a G-rated movie before you have kids and compare it to your experience after you have kids.  The Toy Story series has a lot of things toddlers are taught not to do - calling each other idiots, punching each other in the face, and otherwise using \\"not nice words\\" that is an integral part of any comedy act. It's funny, but it ain't for kids.<br /><br />That's the brilliance of the Toy Story series.  It's about childish things but not about children.  The first Toy Story movie was as much about being a parent as it was about being a toy.  In Toy Story the parent (Woody) was replaced by the boy's new stepdad (Buzz).  Woody, old-fashioned and stubborn, had to blend the new and old families in a way that respected everyone involved.  And they did, unified by the love of their \\"son\\" Andy.<br /><br />Toy Story 2 was about putting the parent's needs above the child.  An injury reminded Woody of his mortality. He had an opportunity to forge his own path, independent of Andy.  Instead he chose to stay with the boy, forgoing fame for the love of his child.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 reaches the logical outcome that loomed in Toy Story 2.  Andy grew up. He's moving on to college and his \\"parents\\" are left behind. What's to become of them? Will they be stored away in some old attic, forgotten?  Or will they find a new life in retirement?<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is all about family.  What's more important is that they stick together, a point repeated by Buzz and Woody. They may lose their child, but at least they have each other.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is also a prison caper, complete with seemingly pleasant wardens, a prison gang, and escape attempts. And yet Toy Story 3 is far more entertaining than most live action prison escape movies. Packed with action, filled with poignant moments, and featuring all the characters we've come to know over a decade, Toy Story 3 is a love note to the toys - and people - we've left behind.  More Escape from Preschoolcatraz than a comedy, Toy Story 3 is an adult take on an adult problem.  It just happens to use toys to tell the tale.<br /><br />My son won't be watching Toy Story 3 until he's a lot older.e've come to know over a decade, Toy Story 3 is a love note to the toys - and people - we've left behind.

B0011UJMK2|4.0|I enjoyed this book both for the satisfying serial killer storyline, as well as the engaging subplots. I found the characterization of Leo, Raisa, Vasili, and other minor characters enjoyable and I was engrossed in the atmosphere the author created - as anxious as any Soviet. I especially appreciated the afterword with its references to other interesting reads.
0312600844|4.0|Gentrification in St. Paul is the pursuit of Patty and Walter Berglund, parents of two children.  Merrie and Seth Paulsen are neighbors in Ramsey Hill.  The author has caught the class warfare in the part of his plot concerning the Berglunds, their son Joey, and another neighbor, a single mother, Carol Monaghan and her daughter Connie.      The second section recounts the back story of Patty and Walter.  It portrays hopefulness.  In it Patty refers to herself in the third person.  Chapter three advances the story in its description of Patty's  family's self-satisfaction derived from their position as New Yorkers.  The collateral of adult sophistication permits family members to act as children.      One section of the book is called Mountaintop Removal.  In it Walter has moved into the field of conservation and the site of his workplace is Washington, D.C.  The plot of the book veers in huge arcs.  Patty is depressed, the conservatives are in office, and Walter's college friend, Richard Katz, is a middle-aged success.    Jonathan Franzen has imagination and skill.  This reader considers similarities to John Irving for wild plotting, and John Updike for subject matter turning on domestic travails rendered in accomplished prose.  The novel has philosophical themes.  What are the consequences of too many opportunities, too many choices?
0385341008|5.0|What an amazing story!  This is great for a book group or just to read on your own.  I loved the writer's style and use of letters to tell the story.  Makes me want to travel to Guernsey!  I'm not going to sell my copy, because it's a story I'll read again and again.  I have recommended this to friends and family and they love it too.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|A rural n'er-do-well with several dependants goes missing whilst on bail - it falls to his eldest daughter to make good on the amount of said bail - or forfeit the family home.<br /><br />Her attempts to locate her father - who might be hiding among her own extended family of sinister outlaws - proove to be more harrowing than she had expected.<br /><br />The performances are quite within measure for the 'types' portrayed, the dialogue is realistic as is the action and motivation of the various characters.<br /><br />Essentially a melodrama that might have been set as a costume piece, but here the expositional element is 'crank' - instead of 'bank robbery' - or 'moonshine' - or even 'weed' just two or three decades ago, I found this film to be compelling, and I would have no reservations in recommending it to anyone who enjoys Westerns.
B003Y8YXEO|5.0|I always loved the Beatles and John was certainly a major part of the band.  I went to see the 30th anniversary concert for John Lennon and all these memmories came back.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|When I say this is a terrific movie, you can believe me. I haven't got an ounce of child in me. I'd rather slit my throat than to go to Disney. Chuck E Cheese's is torture, boardwalk games make me hyperventilate.<br /><br />But... this movie about a villain who wants to steal the moon appeals to adults in a way that other kids' movies don't. Many movies for kids throw in adult situations, double entendres, crass dialog and rude humor, thinking that's how to draw in the adults. [[ASIN:B0042U94UQ Despicable Me]] is appealing to adults because the story's scenes are familiar -- they're situations that we live every day. Rocky relationships with neighbors, frustrations with aging parents, younger workers taking our jobs, family obligations conflicting with job responsibilities. We know what Gru is going through!<br /><br />Yet this appeal for adults does nothing to make the movie less enjoyable for kids. My son says it's his favorite movie of all time. He knew the DVD release date and made sure we reserved one at the bookstore. The dialog is clever and the characters delightfully drawn. It's the classic story of a villian whose heart is changed by the love of a child -- or in this case, three children. A great movie for both kids and adults.
B000I2J2WM|1.0|The product advertises that it is a HD DVD.  Assumption is that it will play on any HD system.

It would have been nice to have this disclosure in the advertising of the product before I purchased it.
0691142165|5.0|This book presents original research and lays it onto a background narrative of financial crises many hundred years old.  As the FIRST book you read on this subject, it is a lot (albeit very readable).  If you have read Kindleberger's  \\"Manias Panics and Crashes\\" book or Roubini's \\"Crisis Economics\\" book and want a broader understanding of where to look in the runup to and rundown after crises, this is your book.  There is even a self-contained few-chapter summary of the current world economic crisis, with real insights on how this is and is not different than recent crises. I put this on Kindle on my iphone and did a few pages at a time in between other things (BTW use Kindle instead of ibook for the note function if nothing else). Read it.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|After watching this movie a second time, It just went from bad to worse. It just kills me that Yates and Co. were brought back for the rest of the series.     The director seems to think that a \\"dark story\\" means insufficient lighting in a film. This movie seems to be lit by candle light. You can't see the actors or the magnificent sets at all. The writing and direction is lackluster at best.       I get it that things must be left out in order to make a book into a movie, story lines must be changed somewhat in order to do this, but there is no excuse for adding things that weren't in the book, while dropping important parts that were.  It is like the best parts of the book were changed or left out entirely, and all of the slower parts of the book were extended as far as they could go, and then extended some more.     There are parts in the book could have been explored in more detail, which would have made this movie truer to form, and much more exciting. They have however, taken the vision and the promise of an extremely good book, cut out all of the pages, wrote a few chapters of their own, and sewn everything back in some haphazard manner. It is completely lacking in the qualities that made the book so good. The awful screenwriting seems to have taken it's toll even on the most talented actors, and the entirety of the film comes out as one drab mess. Director David Yates and his team seem to think that they can write the story better than J. K. Rowling...     They should have hired someone out of high school to direct and write the screenplay, or better yet, stuck with Alfonso Cuaron (Prisoner Of Azkaban) and his team. OMG if this wasn't a Harry Potter film, no one would have gone to see it. It has become a sad ending to a wonderful story. Seriously.
0920668372|1.0|We received this book from my mother-in-law.  Based upon the inscription she was obviously very touched by the book and it was very meaningful to her.  She meant it to be shared with our children, but after only a few readings my husband and I began referring to it amongst ourselves as the \\"stalker mom\\" book.  FWIW my mother-in-law has some serious boundary issues which might explain things a bit.    I have nothing wrong with a parent loving their child - there's nothing wrong with the bond between parent and son (or daughter).  There is something wrong with a mother driving across town, using a ladder to get into her son's room, picking him up off the bed and rocking him in her arms whether or not it's a story in a book or something that happens in real life.  To me it seems more a story about a mother who has been unable to accept the natural change in the parent/child relationship.  One can love their child forever without treating them like a baby their entire life (let alone breaking into their house to do so).    We found \\"[[ASIN:0439434203 I Will Hold You 'til You Sleep]]\\" by Linda Zuckerman to be a much more appropriate book as it carries the theme of love between parent and child while also showing how the relationship changes as the child grows up.  The fact that it models healthy boundaries at the same time is an extra bonus.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|This is in no way a true story, though it is based on true situations. The Germans in general and the German SS in particular killed millions of Jews, one by one, one after another, or massively in their camps. And when the Jewish local band at Auschwitz was playing some music for some inner celebration of some kind, thousands were arriving on the trains and were disembarked on the platform, sorted out for shower and then cremated. The crematorium never stopped burning.<br /><br />That in France, in the Resistance or dropped into the country with parachutes generally, there were units, some made up of Jews from all nations around the world, is no surprise, is no invention. That these units were vengeful and tried to make some Germans they could catch, SS or not, pay for their evil actions in suffering and torturing and all kinds of other immoral, unwarlike and despicable actions is no invention. There were at least some and maybe many.<br /><br />To make a film on that very subject is not uninteresting. But does it have any interest for the knowledge of history, for the education of the younger generations, for the moral and ethical good of everyone? Certainly not. It is a film about war seen as an act of vengeance, and the film itself is an act of vengeance against people who are not there to say a word about it. Vengeance is not a good attitude. Try to imagine what the Vietnamese should say, show and even do against the French or the Americans because of the Indochina or Vietnam wars if they were vengeful.<br /><br />But then why did Tarantino, a good film maker, and Brad Pitt, a good actor, decided to do that film? To follow Tom Cruise in that territory, but Tom Cruise was at least dealing with a real episode of the war. Maybe to deal with some \\"respectable\\" horror, horror that can be said ethical or ethically motivated? As for that the film is dealing with so many clich&eacute;s about the sexual and brutal phantasms of standard human beings that it becomes a parade of events about which we seem to think, one after the other, how gory is it going to be? Gory, exciting, gross, disgusting? We seem to be appealed by the entry \\"horror\\" of a thesaurus. I find this film regrettable and very badly inspired.<br /><br />Apart from that, the film is well done, contains a good dose of suspense or thrilling expectations, and the editing as much as the shooting (what a word in this context) are realistic enough to make us believe we are in Paris or we are in history. But it takes more than good technique to make a good film. Since the dominant point of view in the film is Jewish, I consider that this vengeful attitude in Jews is absolutely unacceptable, and I can tell you those I know and who have done something during the war, did not do that kind of horror which was more on the side of the SS for one and some resistance groups that were not exactly controlled by presentable networks: there were some freelance groups that only took advantage of the situation to loot, raid and just satisfy their death instinct on anyone who could be in their way, far from it only the Germans.<br /><br />Now we are 65 years after the end of this butchery we could start in the film industry to get to a more historical perspective and not to some crazy idea that Hitler could have been burnt up with all its accomplices in a Paris local cinema by a Jewish female survivor, a black man, and the non-coordinated help of two American Jews. Or maybe it is just plain Jewish black humor. But the subject is badly chosen and that kind of humor has to be self-deprecating. It is not. Those Jewish barbarians want to appear as war heroes not as pathetic puppets in the hands of some illuminated blood-crazed scalp-obsessed guru.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDe seem to think, one after the other, how gory is it going to be?

031603973X|5.0|Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (a familiar story that I won't address in this review) beautifully comes to life with Chuck Fischer's pop-up illustrations. As it is Christmas-time, I want very much to display this book in my window (unfortunately, the sill isn't wide enough and the cat would probably complain about her space being usurped). I am blown away by the detail here: the chains of Marley actually dangle (another reason not to actually display it as the cat keeps trying to play with this book!). As the illustrations take up all the pages, the novel is broken up in small pull-outs, which makes it easy to break up the story for children. This stunning edition is definitely one to treasure.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I grew up with these artists and their contemporaries. My iTunes library is full of their genre of music. I watched the PBS special of this performance and was elated to find that I could have the DVD and CD in one package. They deliver their classic hits with the same enthusiasm as when young but with greater maturity and humor - which can only be acquired when older... Everything is perfect: lyrics speaking about life, music delivered by those who know it best... Am I biased? I don't think so! I hope the younger generation can enjoy this as much as I do.

I decided to put it on my christmas list. On the 25th I found it and I was over joyed!!!! I spent the whole rest of the day watching the movies and I loved them!!!! Now everytime I get bored or need a fun way to pass time I watch these movies. There was only 1 thing I didn't like, in the Freddy v.s Jason movie there is so much nudity it could make a gay man puke (no affense to anyone just exaggurating). But I always skip that part so all in all it was the best christmas prestent I ever got!!
B003Y5WYGQ|2.0|I anxiously awaited this SHM/SACD upgrade of the classic Cream double album on one disc and was severely disappointed with the audio quality upon arrival! Upon doing an A/B test with the DCC Gold cds (with Steve Hoffman re-mastering) this Wheels Of Fire new import release is sorely lacking. To my ears & in my humble opinion it sounds like they didn't use the original master tapes for re-mastering and the audio is bassy with no crispness or accentuating highs. I went back and forth comparing and it was immediately obvious that this release is a hands down major dud. I felt sick knowing how much I paid for it and waiting for it to come from Japan only for this crappy result. I figured with SHM AND SACD mastering it would be fantastic but I was dead wrong. I have the 3 Hendrix SHM Japan cds and am very happy with the quality of those as it really makes a difference. I also have lot's of SACD's which are mostly all far superior quality to the regular cd versions and were re-mastered properly.   Anyway that's my 2 cents worth but go ahead and find out for yourself if you want but don't say you were not warned. Nuff said..
B00005JLWN|5.0|A strange remake of many films and many books of science fiction. Brave New World, 1984, Brazil, Total Recall, the Running Man, Terminator, and so many others. The basic crime here is to feel. How can we get rid of feelings in order to guarantee social peace and complete control of everyone and everything? The question is the answer.<br /><br />A drug will do the job everyday and destroying anything that could resemble any feeling or their carriers will do the job every night, and we are covered day and night. But what happens in any society? Some do not like drugs and compulsory acts. So they rebel and they stop taking their drugs. And that is called the resistance.<br /><br />In Brave New World they are tolerated in some human reservation, but in this world they are underground and have to fight against the official society overground. And there will always be one secret agent of the feeling police who will rebel one day and will get in touch with the resistance and will be the instrument of the end of this world. That's part of life and no one can prevent it.<br /><br />So the film is a little bit naïve on the means with which one man, even a cleric of super power and strength, can succeed in killing dozens of trained soldiers in about two minutes without even getting a rip in his coat. It yells impossible but we are a good audience and we suspend our disbelief long enough to know that this rebellion is absolutely possible and that it exists in any totalitarian system.<br /><br />The only pass&eacute; element is that the power of \\"free\\" information is not captured in this film which is already old and cannot know the power of the new medium called the Internet and the way even the best kept secrets in the world can be made public tomorrow morning by Wikileaks or any other eaves dropping site.<br /><br />But apart from that it is an entertaining film and I like the dog, the mongrel, the BO of this film that was made even before that famous BO was elected President of the United States who brought a dog named Bo into the White House along with two young girls.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDnamed Bo into the White House along with two young girls.

030745455X|2.0|Having read the 'Girl with the Dragon tattoo', which was Stieg Larsson's first book in the trilogy, I was quite keen to read the further adventures of his favorite heroine, Lisbeth Salander. The first book was an absorbing thriller and mostly believable but for the casually super human hacking powers of Lisbeth. But the sequel, 'Girl who Played with Fire' is rather disappointing and reads often like a hackneyed piece of work. I wish Larsson had put in more thought and time on the sequel. After this book, I wonder if I want to read the third book in the trilogy, 'Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest', even though I must admit that I am intrigued to find out what happens to Lisbeth in the end.<br /><br />Still, this book is quite a good read in spite of its faults. I guess I was waiting for some jaw-dropping stuff and twist in the book as I read on. The book starts rather slowly over the first 150 pages, then picks up pace with triple murders and climaxes towards some good suspense at the end. Unlike the first book, the journalist Blomkvist and Lisbeth do not really come together to solve the mystery. The book is predominantly about Lisbeth.<br /><br />The unravelling of the plot tests your credibility all through. We all know that Lisbeth was a super-smart hacker. We grant her that skill. But Larsson makes her a top notch boxer (at 40 kg!), a computer hacker who steals billions of kroners from various accounts into hers, a mathematician par excellence who dabbles in Fermat's last theorem and also a weapons expert to boot. As if this is not enough, she comes back alive after being battered and buried a few feet deep in a grave and hacks into the most sophisticated computer networks of the Swedish Police system....<br /><br />There are parts of the book which hang loose, like the murder Lisbeth commits early in the book in the Caribbean, the sudden appearance of a world re-known boxer - Paolo Roberto - into the plot and having a go at the bionic giant Niedermann and the introduction of Fermat's theorem as one of the interests of Lisbeth. It all don't add up.<br /><br />However, for all those readers who read Larsson's first book in the trilogy, it would be impossible not to want to read this sequel. Even though I am disappointed with this one, I still have a nagging feeling that I would end up buying the third in the trilogy and read it as well!theorem as one of the interests of Lisbeth. It all don't add up.     However, for all those readers who read Larsson's first book in the trilogy, it would be impossible not to want to read this sequel.

0553805371|4.0|I will preface this by saying that I am NOT a physicist. So my credentials to speak on things scientific are quite weak, being only those of a lifelong amateur reader on those topics.<br /><br />As a believer in \\"infinite space\\", \\"infinite time\\", with the \\"Big Bang\\" thrown in as a likely cyclical phenomenon, I found this book to be easily read and comprehensible to the non-mathematician, but only marginally more satisfying in its conclusions than those postulated by any of the great many cultural stories citing a diety as the source of the universe. A great many analogies were used that while useful in terms of illustrating a point, often seemed highly questionable in their veracity. In justice to the author, he does make the point that such observational data as are available have always tended to confirm the conclusions presented. In short however, I remain unconvinced that in many cases, this most prominent of physicists is drawing the correct conclusions.<br /><br />Two examples of conclusions I found to be highly questionable and apparently lacking much observational confirmation, were that time as a dimension becomes a meaningless term prior to the \\"Big Bang\\" and that in a system where the net energy level is negative (predominated by gravity at the level that it would have existed in our pre-Big Bang \\"protouniverse\\"), spontaneous creation of universes can and does occur. While the author did a great job of demonstrating that at the quantum level different natural laws than those we are familiar with are in play, it seems to me that the seemingly near total lack of solid knowledge about what those quantum laws actually ARE, leaves us in the position of once again essentially believing in \\"magic\\", if \\"magic\\" is defined as \\"any unseen and perhaps unknowable force\\". If this is the current state of the art, it seems to me that our physicists are going to remain quite busy for some time

Durst is sexy white trash;  The first half of the movie held my interest, but as their relationship peters out and becomes more dysfunctional my interest waned and I actually fell asleep    The wrap up ending was completely unfulfilling.  The story it told as if it is based on some truth, but if it is, it has never reached my perception.    Not worth the trip to theatre.

B003TZ9EGO|5.0|If you a fan of Lady GaGa your probably going to hate this CD!  Thats right! Your first thought about this CD is that literally every track sucks!!!  This might sound strange but most songs are so different than thier original song that it is quite hard to get use to them at first. After listening to the CD for a while you start to see that these songs are really awesome and I often prefer listening to the remixes more than thier the original song from her LP The Fame and her EP Fame Monster.  My favorites remixes on the CD include Dance, Telephone, Dance in the Dark, LoveGame, and Bad Romance. Probably the break out hit of the whole CD is the Alejandro Remix which is much better than the original version and really catchy.  If you like to dance, and/or you go to the gym alot, this is the perfect CD for you.   If you dont like remixes and your expecting something new from lady Gaga to hold you off until her new CD comes out in February, then you should probably skip this.  Oh hell, its only 10.00 just buy it!  Im sure it would be worth listening to if you are a big lady gaga fan.

B003YUC2FE|2.0|As many others have already stated, the \\"toy box\\" the discs are packaged in probably looked a lot better on paper. The box itself is pretty flimsy and the \\"discs in a foam block\\" makes finding the disc you're looking for a total pain in the \\"you-know-what.\\" The one and only benefit to buying this set over purchasing the movies separately is that you can get digital copies for the first two films, which weren't (and still aren't, I believe) available when they were originally released on blu-ray.    That said, the blu-ray transfers are simply stunning. I honestly think that Toy Story 3 looked better on my home theater setup than it did when it saw it in the theater (and that was even with the added benefit of 3D!)    As for the movies themselves, I can't add anything more than what other fans of the series have already said. I vacillate constantly on which of the three is the \\"better\\" movie and have finally come to the decision that it's simply \\"too close to call.\\"

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific is as good of a series as Band of Brothers...great story lines and comraderie. This does not have the same actors as Band of Brothers as it is a completely separate series, so don't be expecting to see continuation of Band of Brothers. Very informative and entertaining.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|As a fan since season one, I was not sure how Kripke and Co. would pull off the apocalypse, but they managed to create an appropriately tense atmosphere while keeping the focus where it has always been, on the family dynamic between Sam and Dean.  I am a diehard fan of both brothers, so seeing them at odds was difficult, but necessary, given where season four left off.  I don't want to give away anything for those who have not viewed season five yet, but if you enjoy the family drama between the brothers, then you will enjoy season five.  However, if you are expecting some huge apocalyptic episodes, you will be disappointed.  Supernatural has always struggled with budget, so keeping the story on a smaller scale while hinting at the bigger worldwide calamities was in keeping with the show's history.  The performances, as usual, are fantastic and the increased presence of Bobby is very welcome.  A special mention for Misha Collins, as his performance is excellent and the character development of Castiel is wonderful.  All in all, an excellent season of Supernatural and we are happy to own it, along with seasons 1-4.

B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I listen to this album a lot more than I thought I would. I had to get it just because Bonamassa was in the group. It's really good. Takes a little time to absorb. The songs are lengthy, but if you sit and take the time, they develop in really cool ways. Glenn's bass tone is superb, Bonamassa sounds great as always, and Jason Bonham is a great drummer. Must be in the blood... My only complaint is that virtuoso keyboardist Derek Sherinian doesn't really get to shine often. His parts are either mixed low or just few and far between. Other than that, if you like classic rock, or rock in general, and you're ready for something newer than 1979, get this album.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|I made a rule for myself: do not purchase a movie before I have seen it.  When I read the reviews I thought this was a must have.  The Town has been compared to the film Heat (one of the best crime films ever).  The characters in The Town have some depth, but they are not as developed as in Heat.  The story is not as intricate.  The gun battles aren't as dramatic.  How could one compare Pacino, De Niro, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, and a teen-age Natalie Portman to Affleck, Renner, and  Jon Hamm?  It's not fair.  It's not even close.  The acting in Heat made me feel something.  Affleck and Rebecca Hall were the only actors that moved me, albeit slightly.  I hoped for more from Hamm.  The Town is a good movie, and it is definitely worth viewing.  Ben is going to be a really good director.  However, if I had seen it in a theater, or rented it I would not have purchased it.  Sometimes we have rules for a reason.  I shouldn't have broken mine.

It is reasonably priced and looks cute in her room, but most importantly she is fascinated by it.

At times i found myself wondering when the end came.

0515141429|3.0|Well i can't really say whether i like this book or not i ordered it on NOV.27 2010 it is now Dec30th and i as yet have not   received this book i get the tracking notice it says it was sent to the post office in my town but as yet it has not been delivered to me i don't think it is my place to have to go to the post office to find out what has happened to it for i know they will probably tell me they don't have it i think the sender should be responsible to inquire on what happened to it i gave my husband the series of books for Christmas but as you can guess this book is the first one of the series. I don't think i will be ordering from this particular vendor again.i think they should have sent a replacement when i complained after three weeks that i had not received it.
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|I feel as if this cd was pretty much the same song over, and over, and over again.  Only a few songs stuck out.  My opinion is she is a much better artist when \\"featured\\" on another artist's song.
B004EAQNO4|1.0|I was hoping this would bring M. Night back but it was once again a failure!  The ending was ok.  This movie did not thrill or scare me in the least.  I was really  hoping for more as the previews looked good.  Once again the few scenes that weren't bad are in the previews so it is not worth renting!

B00005QGAX|5.0|This is a awesome cd the best songs on this disc are<br /><br />bad, the way you make me feel, speed demon, liberian girl, man in the mirror, dirty diana, smooth criminal and leave me alone
B001E45XT4|4.0|I just got this headset about 2 days ago. And I gotta say, it sounds AMAZING! I use it for Skype, and Narrating my YouTube videos. And it sounds great, but the only thing I dislike are the fabric around the ear pieces. The fabric is very irritation, and rubs against your skin, leaving it itchy after about 20+ minutes of use. But all in all, I love this headset. Great for the price!
B00433TO52|5.0|I really like this collection. Its everything I was looking for and a bit more. I wanted a complete Shakespeare collection, with all his plays and poetry, so it was great to find this one that had these extra plays as well to make it  the most complete collection. Its also easy to read and I found I could read it both holding my Kindle vertical or horizontal.  Its also simple to navigate.  So nothing more I could ask for :) Really nice collection.
B003Y5H4SO|2.0|WTF is this movie pg13!?  Could have went with the flow like the rest of the supposed scary movies and made a rated R movie instead (This movie wasn't scary at all).  Glad I watched it on PPV and used a certificate so I didnt waste any money on it.  On another note it got to the point right away at least.  Not sure whats with the pg and pg13 movies lately...
B00005OAJ1|3.0|This CD is at times hilarious and musically impressive.  I only became interested in it b/c someone showed me the \\"Tribute\\" video - that one song was enough for me to purchase it.  Well, that and I'm a big J.B. fan (and the CD was only $3+S/H).    I would characterize it as acoustic thrash, peppered with comedy bits in/between the songs.  Most songs are short, but I am happy with the number of songs.  I tend to FF the bits when I'm in the car, but i listen to the whole shlmeal when i'm just fartin' around on the computer. Some of the songs are down-right smashing (Tribute, City Hall, Wonderboy) and Drive-Thru & Inward Singing are ROFL good.  My personal fave is Double-Team (yes, it's what you think it is).    Think of this album as if Spinal Tap did an acoustic session album like Led Zeppelin III and you're pretty close.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|This is a great movie. this movie has everything, drama,  comedy, romance. action. this movie is great i love max. he has to be one of the funniest disney characters i've seen in a long time. this movie great for kids and adults.
B002ZG981E|4.0|Chris Nolan's \\"Inception\\" is like a giant puzzle and, as such, those that are interested in puzzles will probably enjoy this movie more than those who hate puzzles.<br /><br />Chris Nolan tackles some dark and stormy themes as part of his exceptional science fiction thriller \\"Inception\\" reminding us why he's one of the most talented and challenging mainstream film directors. Cobb (DeCaprio) leads a team involved in corporate espionage invading the minds of others taking their ideas for his employers. After one deal goes bad he gets an unusual offer from Saito (Watanabe); Saito wants Cobb and his team to plant an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Murphy) that will give Saito's company an advantage in the marketplace. Cobb knows the risks though as Inception can rarely be done and pulled off but he has his own motive pushing him to succeed; Cobb wants to be able to come home to America and see his children again after being on the run for years. ***<br /><br />Anchored by a strong, complex performance by DeCaprio and his supporting cast, \\"Inception\\" would seem doomed to failure simply because of the mulitple plot strands that weave around each other in the film. Nolan has accomplished a rare and unique feat (that he's managed to pull off before but not with such a complex narrative); he has created a summer blockbuster film with a brain and a heart that also has all the muscles of an action thriller. He may occasionally almost miss catching one of the many balls that he is juggling but the deft exposition of the film in the first half (and using the clever plot device of having Page play a novice to the team allowing us to learn at the same time about how the team operates) and action packed second half more than make up for any slip in the storytelling illusion that Nolan pulls off here. ***<br /><br />As a thriller \\"Inception\\" has more in common with \\"Insomnia\\", \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Prestige\\" than it does with \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"The Dark Knight\\" or even Nolan's first film \\"Following\\". He takes all the lessons he's learned from those films and puts them to excellent use here crafting a film that constantly keeps the audience on its toes even in the conclusion of the film which leaves the resolution open to interpretation.<br /><br />As with all of Nolan's films, \\"Inception\\" looks marvelous with a distinct look to each \\"layer\\" of the film. It's pretty amazing what Nolan creates visually in collaboration with his director of photography considering that he is color blind. The Blu-ray receives an equally strong presentation here as it did in theaters. Colors pop with a distinct visual style for each level of the dream a challenge for both audiences and the production team. The transfer looks amazingly sharp with a crisp, detailed transfer that has very good depth. I didn't see any hint of edge enhancement nor did I see any other digital flaws aside from occasional digital noise that cropped up and that was relatively minor. ***<br /><br />The audio is equally impressive with a lossless audio transfer, nice use of the surround speakers to create the environment of the film.<br /><br />Watching the extras in the \\"Extraction Mode\\" is probably the best way to experience the extras included on the Blu-ray. The option allows one to watch the film while watching the various extras like Nolan who appears in a picture-in-picture special feature providing a nice companion piece to the film itself. I wouldn't watch it this way the very first time of course. You can watch the special features separately as well. There are long periods where the \\"Extraction Mode\\" doesn't have anything though so be prepared--you might find yourself drawn back into the movie only to be extracted again by having it pop up. Nolan doesn't explain the meaning (he leaves that up the individual viewer much as we interpret our own dreams) but does discuss the techniques about HOW he acheived many of the impressive effects of the movie (yes, Nolan uses CGI but he doesn'tuse it as his MAIN tool like a lot of directors might but as one of many preferring where possible to use onset physical effects where possible. ***<br /><br />We get one documentary on the making of the film that veer off into interesting, different and sometimes challenging directions much like the film itself. \\"Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious\\" features actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt as host of a sometimes trippy examination of the subject bringing in a variety of folks from experts on dreaming to Nolan tying it back into the film itself. It runs just under 45 minutes. ***<br /><br />We also get a prequel that explains why Cobb is on the run with \\"The Cobol Job\\" running just under 15 minutes. This motion comic is a nice background piece for those who must know everything and can't take it on faith as to why Cobb was on the run from Cobol and how it forced him into Saito's waiting arms. ***<br /><br />BD-Live material is represented by Project Somnacin: The Confidential Files and we get a generous amount of pre-production artwork and promotional artwork. The extras are rounded out by the trailers and TV ads. All of these special features are presented in HD. -<br /><br />Whether or not you like \\"Inception\\" will depend on what you select a movie for--entertainment, a puzzle that challenges you, enlightenment and how you determine whether or not films like \\"Inception\\" play a role in all of that. Having said that, \\"Inception\\" will not be to everyone's taste. I like the movie quite a bit although I still feel it is flawed but even with those flaws it is better than the most of the summer swill that Hollywood usually has fed us in the past.<br /><br />Chris Nolan has often been accused (like Stanley Kubrick) of creating films that have no heart, no soul and that focuses on the intellect only but if you dig beneath the surface you will find that the film does have a heart and soul.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much that I went to the Scholastic message boards where my screen name is Ponyofishy.  This is an AMAZING action and suspense filled book that you must read. There are absulotley no invincible or perfect characters in all three of the books. The romance is perfectly balanced and doesnt take away from the quality of the book. The plot is very well thought out and makes you really think. The writing is great and never drags. GO READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Loved this movie. It's fast paced and fun! George Clooney is terrific as Mr. Fox. The rules for Whack Bat are hilarious. Adults and kids will enjoy watching this movie.

B00004XPPE|5.0|Released in 1964, this is the best Cold War movie ever made.  The acting is superb on all fronts, and there is no wasted film here.  The US military establishment did NOT want this movie made, and insisted on a silly \\"disclaimer\\" at the end of the film.    I would single out Walter Matthau's performance as the real gem here.  His \\"winnable limited nuclear war\\" speech to the generals is truly insane and brilliant, all at the same time.  Fonda and Hagman do well as two men trying to avert apocalypse, and Fritz Weaver's debut is a sad and disturbing examination of a wounded soul.  Frank Overton is great as General Bogan, and Dan O'Herlihey is quite brilliant as a general with impending doom written all over his dreams.    No music, no soundtrack, no special effects, stark black-and-white camera work...all these serve to intensify the gloom.  Actually, I think Edgar Allan Poe would have loved this movie.    Required viewing.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|I was a fan of Black Dub since I first saw their YouTube videos well over a year ago and I got to see them live at the Bowery Ballroom in 2009. I have to admit, when I first got hold of the official album I was kind of thrown. It sounds different than the YouTube videos, as a number of people have pointed out. Playing live, they sounded like the band in the YouTube videos - just a bunch of incredibly talented musicians playing together. The album is a little different, however. There is significantly more \\"production\\", unexpected mixes, distortion, echo, etc.    When I first heard the album, the songs I had become familiar with suddenly sounded foreign, I couldn't believe that Daniel Lanois couldn't just let a good thing be.    But I gave it time and many more listens and I have to say the album has grown on me a lot. I still like the simpler YouTube versions of the songs, but I don't know that I can say I like them \\"better\\" any more. The album has a lot of amazing tracks, some, like the beautiful Canaan never had YouTube versions so I was able to listen to them with fresh ears.    It's a shame that the album doesn't include I'd Rather Go Blind [...]    So, yes, it's different from the YouTube videos. The album doesn't sound simply like a mic in a room with musicians. I'll buy a Black Dub Live album as soon as one gets made, but I'm still really happy to have this one.
0898159156|5.0|I have owned this book for a few years.  I am always looking in it for new information.  It is written that the average person can understand it!  You don't need to be a scientist!  A lot of great pictures.  It is like the Bible of carnivorous plants!  I highly recommend it.
B002ZG999U|5.0|A MUST buy. This movie was fantastical. I didn't get to see this movie at the theaters so I bought it as soon as it came out on dvd because all my friends kept telling me how awesome it was. It was well worth the wait because I must have replayed certain scenes 10 times. I really love this movie, Stallone has definitely mastered the art of producing movies. He would get a 10 star rating if I could give it.
B003XU75QG|5.0|I am truly shocked at how good this album is.  Taylor's voice is brilliant.  The songs are well-written and well-played.  I highly recommned it!
B003ES61EE|5.0|And I really like the retractable brush design feature. I just received mine today and so far I have cleaned my digital camera, my binoculars, two pairs, my reading glasses and the touch pad of my laptop.     It's a useful object with a cool design that you can take anywhere or keep anywhere. I imagine it would be good for spot cleaning old vinyl, too.
1439136653|2.0|The movie \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is one of those few exceptions where the movie is much, much, better than the book it is based on.  The academy award for best screenplay adapted from another source was well-earned, as the screenwriter took a really awful book and turned it into a compelling story.      The actual writing isn't that good, but what I really did not like about the book was its relentlessly oppressive, depressing tone throughout the story.  Nothing but horrible bad things happen to our protagonist and his friends. It might be reality in the slums of Mumbai, but it makes for a dreary time reading about it.  I sure hope things aren't that bad for the poor in Mumbai.  If they are, how could millions of the poor still be alive?  I'd think they'd all be dead from some horrible calamity.  If you want to read about third-world slum living, this might be a good book to read. Otherwise, watch the movie and skip the book if the story interests you.
B001UV4XFQ|3.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo product. This is not a review of the movie content itself.    When this product was initially released, it was not clearly advertised. This \\"Combo\\" pack is not the traditional Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack that many of us have grown to love and expect to complete our collections. Usually these contain 1 disc with the Blu-ray content and 1 separate disc for the DVD. This product, however, is 1 disc with Blu-ray on one side and DVD on the flip side. The term combo is very misleading.    I wish the details of this particular release had been more clear when I purchased it. I would have bought the cheaper single-disc Blu-ray only version.
030746363X|4.0|The four hour body delivers exactly what it says it will. My recommendation on if you should by the book or not would be this. I there is something listed in the book that you need to know or would like to try out then buy it. You are going to spend more time and money trying to figure this stuff out yourself anyway. I am all for the unconventional methods of changing things about yourself. Why?, because going agains convention usually does the trick form me and the statistics are backed up in this book so I say go for it.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH IN MY LIFE! I am normally not as big a fan of comedy shows and The Office, while mildly funny, has never had me ROLLING ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING, LITERALLY.   Plus, Joel McHale is very attractive.

B001E45XT4|4.0|I had originally posted a review of this product that blasted the sound quality of these headphones, but I have to recant my previous review. The sound quality of these headphones CAN be great. Originally I wasn't getting any bass response from my headphones, but then after a while I realized that if you have ONLY the headphone portion of the headset plugged in, the sound is amazing. Great bass response, and all around sound. BUT... if you have the microphone portion of the headset plugged in as well as the headphones... you will get sound only in one side of the headphone, and it will be a bassless mono sound. SO, depending on your use, and needs, these can be really great headphones. You just have to decide what you can give and take to make them suit your needs. I bump my original 3 star review up to 4 stars, because you CAN get decent sound out of this headset, but you have to sacrifice the microphone for the time being...

B000FC13Y0|3.0|As one who is just breaking in to the fantasy genre, I was hoping to be \\"wowed\\" by this book. I have the movie, and absolutely love it. Typically anything to do with magic wins me over. However, I found that the movie was actually better than the book in this instance.<br /><br />I wanted the book to have more depth, and to go in to further detail on specific happenings. Perhaps it is because the last couple fantasy books I've read have been part of a series, which allows for more depth.<br /><br />This was a fun book, and didn't leave me bored, but it left me hungry for more. I'm not sure it was worth the $8.99. Also, I found several typos in the Kindle book, which made it difficult to concentrate.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|I bought this for my step-dad for Christmas and it arrived just in time! He'd been asking about it for a while and it was a nice surprise.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|As long time fans, we received Illuminations for Christmas and were excited to listen to it.  After reading some of the reviews here, we can tell that we are not alone in being less than pleased.  The Josh Groban voice is still fantistic;  however, the unusual arrangements and the frequent use of falsetto did not capitalize on his fantistic voice.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|A stunning return to form by the crew. After a blistering debut album, Slipknot didn't achieve the highs of that record with their next offerings. Although each was a good album, none had been able to rival that debut record, until now. This album offers it all, the blistering drum attacks that have become a trademark. Slamming guitars and percussions to make your head fall off from moshing. Then the growling, snarling and spitting vocals we've come to know and love. This album also offers some more melodic numbers so we can all marvel at the sweet sounding singing voice behind the snarl of norm. This album has the hook lines that'll keep you humming songs days after you last listened. It has songs that you want to listen to over and over again. It has power to please those who want to listen to something heavy while having the melody many heavy music lacks. I won't say this album is better than their debut, but its definitely on a par. Buy it.
0307346617|5.0|Masterpiece. Loved it. I'm a zombie nut and this rocked my world. Even got me a little scared late one night and I figured out I didn't have anything in the bedroom to fend off the undead. Now I am better prepared with a baseball bat under the bed and a bo-staff in the lounge. I have a daughter, so a shotgun is not really sensible, given the unlikelihood of a zombie apocalypse.  Anyhow, read it, it's good.
0307454541|5.0|As a novelist, I never read detective stories, though I have watched Morse, Frost and Wexford with pleasure, always because of the character. I am reading this again for the third time in six months because it is different. This is a work of art because it reveals parts of our world which are hidden from most of us: the world of financial journalism which exposes the inevitable crookedness of business; of computer crime and the possibilities and means of hacking and how otherwise little people can affect the great and the good and even governments; of the defects in the Swedish justice system wherein those empowered to help the disfunctional prey upon them; and the activities of rogue groups within the secret service which commit wrongdoing to protect themselves.<br />These are part of the substance of what it is about. The style is not literary which is a bonus: there is no studied attempt to produce exotic prose-- all most literary publishers are interested in: snobbery rules. If only it fits the genre in seeming to be a clever use of words. Rubbish! The best writing is not about this at all. Larsson breaks the rules because he must. He explains the worlds of interest to him and this works as narrative, continuously gripping narrative, because none of the usual 'rules of writing' are obeyed except this: these people and their doings interest me and I am here to tell you about them.<br />No publisher (except this one) would have allowed all these very long explanations. They would have been edited out as harmful to the story! Yet they are fundamental. And the lesson was not learned by the Swedish film makers! They have been excised root and branch from the film which makes very little sense in consequence. The world, the publishing world is, alas, full of idiots who will take any great work like this and say: I will publish this providing you let me rewrite it. And God be praised I will be able to publish it more cheaply because I know how to get rid of half of it. The assumption is that the word 'publishable' has an objective meaning and they in their godlike grandeur, know what it is. The death of the book has more to do with publishers than is commonly realised.<br />Lisbeth Salander is, I think, an accidental creation who grew and grew as he wrote. As a mathematician, I was delighted by the passage where she solves Fermat's Last Theorem. [Andrew Wiles proved this after years of work, OK. But Salander is made to see what Fermat himself saw: the insight which took seconds and no one has ever shared (assuming Fermat was not a liar, almost inconceivable in a scholar of that supreme calibre: all the best minds despise falsehood)]. And then she cannot profit from the insight for a reason which is brilliant and fundamental. Here then is yet another world explored by Larsson in the book: the dysfunctional,apparently uneducated person who, before our very eyes,becomes an autodidact of genius. Of course I wanted to read the textook that Salander had used: a book published at Harvard. And there is no such book. What fun!<br />The lesson of this trilogy is that the author is King (or Queen). Let him tell his story and describe, to the limit that he thinks necessary, all these aspects of the world he lays before us.<br />Before the mind of the publisher, is an invariant: the average reader whose presumed inability to concentrate and learn anyhing {God forbid that he should be put in the schoolroom again!} is the object of the enterprise. Heavens! Without pandering to him how can we make any money?<br />Publishers have a long history of thinking in this way and, mostly they get it quite wrong. Books are successful in spite of them. [Doubtless, many marvels are lost because of them]. A vast tonnage of garbage is published every day. Of course it hardly needs saying that if they had any ability themselves they would be writers. Instead they have chosen to make money, (and have the improved status of 'controlling writers') which real writers are interested in only peripherally: they need a little to be able to write, all that really matters to them. What publisher would ever allow a passage like that on mathematics in case it put off the average reader?<br />Larsson's trilogy is brilliant, fascinating, worth talking about every day. I will read it many times because there is nothing to touch it; will recommend it to my dying day.<br /><br />William Wallace Cunningham Scott, 30.12.2010.in only peripherally: they need a little to be able to write, all that really matters to them.

B000ICXQS8|5.0|I am a person who rarely cries. Ever. Especially in movies. When watching this classic tale of forbidden love I broke down crying almost 5 times. I did not cry when Bambi's Mother got shot, seeing it at the age of 8 even. I did not cry when Jack died at the end of Titanic. However, I cried when these two men left each other for the first time. I cried when they re-united for the first time. I cried when they cried. I cried when the fought. I cried when they laughed. This movie touches your heart like non-other can. It isn't the fact that their homosexual men but the fact that these two people are deeply in love and cannot possibly end up together. Some might say this movie is \\"boring\\" and \\"slow-moving\\" but what do you expect from a culture like this? They have slow paced lives and I am sick and tired of \\"epic chase scenes\\" and \\"intense action.\\" This movie gives you the joys of being a rancher and a cowboy without all the glitter and the props. It takes real acting, fantastic acting, to have two competely straight men in real life have the sexual tension and longing that Jake Gyllenhaal and (R.I.P.) Heath Ledger possess so beautifully. This is a movie for the ages and I would recommend it to anyone who has a deep passion for love and great films.
B000AA4JMK|4.0|By far the greatest musical ever made, and a great movie to boot. Watch this and for hours after you'l' be \\"Reviewing the situation\\". The movie is split onto 2 sides with an annoying intermission in the middle, which is the slowest moving thing I've ever seen, but that does not take anything away from the mastery of this movie. Plus you get a handy CD with all the songs to carry around with you, a must for all aspiring stage performers. I've never set foot on a stage nor had designs to do so, until the role of Fagin comes up in a local theater. I AM going to play Fagin at some point in my life, then retire from the world of acting knowing I have portrayed a character in the greatest musical ever made.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book covers so much information it is almost ridiculous. I absolutely loved this book. One of the most refreshing aspects of this book is that the author is not taking credit for any of the ground breaking data, he simplifies it, samples it, then gives credit and links to the authorities in the field. Brilliant. As a nurse and martial artist I thought I had a good grasp on fitness and health, wrong. So much good information that was new to me.   It is more like one hundred manuals in one. Pick a chapter, read it, research it, and do it.   Buy it? Absolutely yes. It could take a lifetime gathering all this information. For 9.99 (kindle) it is worth it and more.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|There are many reasons to like Batman: as with Sherlock Holmes, for the atmosphere; as with Agatha Christie or Michael Westen, for the technical challenge of investigation or defeating an opponent; for the power of the narrative, as with some Wolverine stories; but also, as with the works of Stephen R. Donaldson, for the moral drama.  Batman: Under the Red Hood contains that element of moral drama in an animated film very appropriate for its subject.  I was a little skeptical at first, because Batman isn't voiced by Kevin Conroy; but Bruce Greenwood has a very similar sound, and was excellent in the role.  I thought a few of the Joker's lines were delivered very woodenly, and those stood out from what was otherwise a fine and creditable performance, and I will admit to cringing at young Robin; but other than that, the fine touch of Andrea Romano elicited very believable delivery.  This is the not the funnest Batman movie ever, but I think it is the most engaging.
0061537969|5.0|My best friend handed me this book.  She could not get past the dog-as-narrator thing.  I was not sure I could either, but agreed to try.  I was instantly in love.  I could not put it down.  The main character reminded me so much of my friend, Michael, that I had to give him the book as soon as I finished reading. I learned a lot about racing, a subject I never had any interest in before.  The analogies made to life, however, were so spot on that I could not resist them.  I still find myself pondering some lines from this novel.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|As a huge fan of the genre I really enjoyed this film.  Sure it wasn't mindblowing but it was still very good and Angelina was surprisingly good in her role.  Just a hint - go for the unrated extended cut which is a far more complete film than what was released in theaters.  That was what I watched and I didn't have some of the issues that people had that saw it in the theater.  On the extras the director or producer was exclaiming that he had never seen a woman involved in an action story at this level.  Sorry, but apparently he missed the 125 hours of the ALIAS TV series which re-defined the spy genre - so much so that Bond had to be reworked it looked so bad in comparison.  And although Evelyn Salt was good, she wouldn't last 10 seconds against Sidyney Bristow.  But that aside, the film was full of action and kept the plot lively and guessing until the end.
B001JIFYSA|1.0|I can't believe the British can make such an awful movie... I thought it was just a bad stereotype about them, but they really are just awful actors, the storyline is horrible. Ahhhhhh.. Don't waste your time, there is nudity and every other part of the movie is lacking as well.

0312600844|2.0|As if to mirror our present culture, Freedom has grand ambition but lacks subtlety and patience. It's as if Franzen was writing this while pumping away in the gym. The prose lacks elegance, structural continuity, and emotional weight. The characters...while vividly drawn...aren't the kind of people with whom I'd spend 15 minutes at a party, much less decades and a few hundred pages.<br /><br />If you're looking for domestic drama, stick with John Updike.

0307269760|4.0|Alice Munro writes short fiction at such a high level it's almost beyond criticism.  Words perfectly placed, incidents perfectly proportioned in relation to the whole - the reader experiences each story as a superbly made object, more like elegant sculpture than prose.<br /><br />Some of these stories are more unsettling than Munro's usual work.  Dimensions and Child's Play deal with child murders, edging into the chilly gothic realms of Joyce Carol Oates.  Other stories contain her familiar array of intelligent, slightly rebellious Canadian girls.  Their lives often pivot around a central event whose implications can play out over an entire lifetime.  Deep Holes, Wenlock Edge and Some Women all hinge on mysterious, sometimes inexplicable behavior, made more resonant by the precision with which the actions and emotional reactions are laid out.  Wenlock Edge, which describes a young college girl's complicity in her own degradation, lingers in a particularly spooky way long after it ends.<br /><br />Munro often sets up a tension between the things you can master with your mind and the things in your mind that master you.  Wood, a story about a down to earth woodcutter who has an accident in the forest, does this simply and beautifully.  The longest tale in this collection, Too Much Happiness, is based on the actual life of Sophia Kovalevsky, a female mathematician and novelist, whose mind and spirit soar just when her body decides to betray her.<br /><br />Aging has been another recent preoccupation of the author's.  Fiction is about Joyce's accidental encounter with the daughter of a woman who once completely disrupted her life.  The daughter has written a short story about those times, and Joyce must reconcile her past and present reactions to those events.  In Free Radicals, an older woman usurps the past of her deceased husband's first wife to talk her way out of a dangerous situation.  For Munro's characters, old age is not about serenity and forgetfulness, but about memories as indelible as the purple birthmark that disfigures the narrator of Face.<br /><br />With the possible exception of Wenlock Edge and perhaps Wood, none of these stories are really in the top tier of Munro's work, which doesn't mean that they aren't excellent.  At this stage, Munro can only be judged against herself.elible as the purple birthmark that disfigures the narrator of Face.

B003ASLJK4|5.0|Well.<br /><br />This movie doesn't need much of a review, as it's one of the best movies ever.  As for the DVD I bought on Amazon, I must say it was super satisfactory, good price/quality relation.  The product has the essential, the movie, the comments, the trailer.<br /><br />I do like buying on amazon, you always get great products at good prices.

0765326353|2.0|I admire Sanderson's ability to write quickly, but his nanowrimo-like approach has some serious drawbacks.  And the flaws are readily and frequently apparent in this latest work of his.  Now, the world I did find the story interesting, and will most likely continue reading the series, but I really wish Sanderson would slow down and improve the quality of his prose. For instance, every character's POV is littered with an overabundance of rhetorical questions which make the story sound amateurish and the characters' thought frequently redundant. Too many characters have similar reactions--sniffing or raising one eyebrow.  Many of the female characters feel more Robert Jordan-esque: a woman famed for her wit and grace considers throwing a tantrum twice to her her way.  And too many times a character says something dramatic and then jogs off.<br /><br />Too many scenes seem to reveal Sanderson striving to write to his outline, at the expense of things like character development, good dialogue, and plot progression.  The prose is often overwritten.  Phrases like \\"as literal as the rocks themselves\\" or \\"waved curtly\\"or \\"frowned in sorrow\\" are puzzlingly bad.  The dialogue suffers too: the scene where one character tells another \\"My sense of honor makes me easy to manipulate\\" is just sad.  Creatures named the \\"songlings\\" won't ever be part of good world building.  Parts of it aren't thought out either--a character who can't afford to heat his house is able to get drunk on strong wine. The plots seem contrived; a character drops something and the wind immediately picks up and blows it away.  The characters aren't particularly interesting early on.  The theology and philosophy are dumbed down and misrepresented to an embarrassing degree.<br /><br />Nearly ever character who is meant to be clever simply interprets words literally.  This isn't clever, especially not after one or two times.  Other mildly sarcastic remarks elicit surprised approval and comments on intelligence from onlookers.  A supposedly clever character responds to her allies instruction of \\"Keep your wits about you,\\" with a joke about keeping her wits about her would mean that someone got too close with a cudgel.  That's not witty, that's annoying.  It's hard to believe that sarcasm is such a rare commodity in any world.  A main character having an invisible fairy on his shoulder reminds me of the Secret of Mana, except that what works in a video game doesn't translate into the written world.<br /><br />On aspect of the world-building I like is the invention of new taboo words.  But simply substituting \\"storm\\" in the same context as our bad words make his supposedly battle-hardened slaves sound unfortunately like the Smurfs.  And putting you assassin in white clothes isn't inverting or playing with tropes, at least not in an interesting way. It's also creepy to read a book written by a Mormon with the question: \\"What would the world be like if all men lived by the book?\\"  The addition of high-born women hiding their hand in sleeves is likewise reminiscent of funny mormon underwear.<br /><br />All that aside, I am interested in the world and the developments.  I am curious about what happens next.  I think this is a good story told poorly--with tighter prose and better editing, he could have had a 400 page book that would have stood as a new classic.  As it is, Sanderson's ability to write so quickly is turning out to hurt him as much as it helps him..

B0041KKYEM|5.0|We went expecting the absolute worst, having been fully briefed ahead of time about the film's misogyny and the plain blank ridiculousness of its plot and its various setups.<br /><br />All ballet movies are somewhat silly, though this one makes something like CENTER STAGE seem like a hard-hitting documentary; and yet I wouldn't hesitate to recommend BLACK SWAN even to Moira Shearer herself if she rose up from her grave and asked what was playing at the movies.  It has something, perhaps the tremendous conviction of the director and his lead actress, that makes its watchable at all times, even when the sheer level of camp rises to over your head, which is often believe me.  Someone said that Natalie Portman, as Nina Sayers, wears one expression on her face through the whole movie--that's not quite true, but BS veterans will know which expression my catty friend was speaking of.  She is extraordinarily disciplined in the part, and it looks crazy difficult, so I predict that she will get the award for this, that Catherine Deneuve should have gotten for REPULSION, the movie this mimics in many ways.  Some have compared BS to SHOWGIRLS, except while that Gina Gershon is miles better than Mila Kunis at playing the sensual, careless rival, Portman seems really to believe in Nina in a way that Elizabeth Berkley always seemed too timid too really go there.  Plus, the costumes and the hair and the makeup (in BS) are all astonishing, probably as good as the ones in the original RED SHOES.<br /><br />The problem with BLACK SWAN, finally, is that the cards seem stacked from the beginning against poor Nina.  She has nothing from the beginning of the movie, and never gets anything (except briefly, she gets to replace Beth MacIntyre)--(and Winona Ryder makes sure Nina never gets to enjoy a moment of that victory).  She has no men, no friends, no fun, a horrible mother and a lousy life.  She has Portman's beauty and grace, but not 15 minutes into the picture she has that rash on her back where it almost seems wings are going to grow.  The movie makes sure that Nina suffers with an almost obscene glory.  In casting Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder as look-alike avatars for Nina, Aronofsky insures that we will (perhaps subconsciously) pity Portman for her present-day good looks, so like Audrey Hepburn's in some shots), because we see what happened to Hershey and Ryder and conclude that time eats away at beauty just like the garbage can opening up its yawning mouth to accept the whole giant cake Hershey orders for Portman in the film's cruelest scene.almost seems wings are going to grow.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is a great blu ray set to own. It has the three movies and animatrix in hd. They all look great too; just as you'd hope to see on a blu ray release like this. There are tons of extras as well; two extra dvd's worth. My set had no digital copies and I don't care, digital copies are a waste of time for me. I will never watch a movie on a laptop or small computer sceen or even worse a phone. common... a phone. they are selling that now  but not with digital discs. news, games sure on a laptop , but a movie needs a larger screen. This set is well done and I personally loved all three movies. ALthough the third one was not up to the level of the first two movies it wssn't terrible at all.<br />This is the set to get it's not that more expensive on amazon.com than the trilogy boxset on blu ray so why not grab this one instead.

It is the familiar Seuss writing style, with lots of illustrations.  Our 3 month old enjoys looking at most of the illustrations.

Two qualities I believe are most important in life. Violent, moving,  and a great story. One of my top 3 favorite movies of all time.

B003Q6D1YW|5.0|\\"Catfish\\" is one of those films that makes you question the e-world entirely, and no--not everything on the Internet is as it seems to be in reality.<br /><br />I've read countless reviews about the film's authenticity, and I would agree that it does makes you wonder how the Schulmans managed to capture EVERY, LITTLE DETAIL precisely. But the thing is, whether the film is fake or not, things like this are REAL, and this film shows that there are witty, but dangerous, individuals out there.<br /><br />The film's rating for me, B+. I saw it months ago, and I instantly fell in love with it. The tagline is true, the less you know about the film, the better. It saves the suspense, and it makes you question the lives of these young men, and what they encounter along the way.<br /><br />Nev Schulman, filmmaker/photographer. The film's protagonist. Very edgy, mid-20s, New Yorker with a bright future ahead. He owns a gallery, and he suddenly begins to receive packages from Abby Pierce, a pre-teen who is a talented artist. Nev begins to develop a relationship with Abby; subsequently, Nev also befriends members of Abby's family, including her older sister Megan and Abby's mother, Angela.<br /><br />Ariel Schulman, filmmaker. He's sort of the antagonist. It is really split between Megan and Ariel; he is a male, and the primary director. He persuades Nev, his brother, to let him film the relationship between Nev and Abby. As the film progresses, Ariel knows that there is more to than Abby than what it seems.<br /><br />Megan Faccio, songstress. She is the mystery. She's the glue to the film. Everything about Megan is something to question. If you can crack Megan's code early on, you will undoubtedly solve the mystery that is \\"Catfish\\".<br /><br />The film is skeptical, yes, but it's a treat to watch. I will be one of many people to buy this film. Actually, I learned a lesson from this (and I think you all have as well).

B002ZG980U|5.0|I saw this movie three times in theaters and have since watched my DVD of it as well. The movie is brilliant, through-and-through, masterfully written, masterfully filmed. Every time I watch it, I catch something new, and that's something that you can't say about a whole lot of movies. Between \\"Inception\\" and [[ASIN:B001GCUO5M Shutter Island]], DiCaprio had a stellar year at the box office.    I think part of what makes this movie so genius is the shake-up in the use of the \\"it was a dream\\" function. While other movies have used \\"it was a dream\\" as a twist (which, when used carefully, can work), \\"Inception\\" tells us from the start that what we will be seeing is a dream, and yet, it still matters.

B002BWQ6H6|1.0|I could not disagree more with the majority of reviewers. This book was so contrived and heavy-handed that I just could not force myself to keep reading.  In one of the vignettes, a character recalls how her dead son, a computer programmer charged with counting the dead in Vietnam, envisioned the internet. In another instance, a young Catholic priest has a forbidden love affair, only to die in a car accident with a hooker. The writing is so flowery and the story lines are so improbable that I really felt like the author underestimated his readers' intelligence. Other reviewers seem to feel bad about giving this book a bad review. I certainly don't. Don't waste your money on this book! It is so contrived it will make you queasy!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I was looking forward to this movie coming out, for good reason. I love Christopher Nolan, and all his work, and also am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. This movie surpassed my expectations which is very rare. I saw it three times in theaters which I have never done for another movie. This movie is definitely worth seeing, and in my opinion one of the best movies of the year, if not THE best.    As far as the Blu Ray goes, I think its a great deal. You get the Blu Ray with the Special Features, the DVD version of the movie, and a Digital Copy for your Computer/iPod/iPad/etc. If you are a fan of the movie you will really love some of the special features, about all the sets, and rigs they built to film this movie.     This is a great buy, well worth the money. Highly Recommended.
030745455X|4.0|I found this novel a good read and hard to put down, but everything was just a bit \\"too much\\" for my taste. There were great plot twists and complications, but some of them were just a bit \\"too much\\" and reduced credibility. The characters were also compelling and intriguing, to say the least, but again, just a bit \\"too much.\\" I haven't read the first in the trilogy yet, so now I think I'll go back and read that one.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I'll admit it--I'm probably a little too old for this book, which may have a lot to do with my opinion. But a friend of mine was going on about it, and it was on sale, and I needed a short read on the flight back to school. So I bought it.    To Collins' credit, the book IS a page turner. But the reason for said page-turning switched abruptly as soon as the fluffy teen romance started up--at some point, I just wanted it to be over.    While the MC, a 16-year-old pseudo-tomboy named Katniss, is at once more likable than her Twilight counterpart (largely due to her take-no-prisoners attitude to anyone who isn't close friend or family), the charade gets rather stale after hearing how much her personally is tamped down (or amped up) by her stunning skills with archery. And botany. And stealth. She's also apparently attractive, though, of course, she doesn't know this.    I was willing to overlook all this, even the somewhat nauseating romantic aspects, until I started seeing slightly modified Twilight scenes--a night sharing a sleeping bag with a feverish boy (alright, so werewolves aren't fevered in Forks, but they do run a temperature); a hallucination involving Katniss seeing a potential love interest 'sparkling' in the sunlight; even a *POSSIBLE SPOILER* battle against half-human, half-wolf creatures.    I mean, really?    All in all, it seems like Ms. Collins covers up the aspects borrowed from elsewhere with an admittedly intriguing plot, plus a post-apocalyptic setting.    I give the book two stars, because I am confident Twilight fans everywhere will rave. And it's nice to see a female heroine who can hold her own.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Seriously great book. Not much of a review I know, but I'm no great writer. Maybe some better editing. I'm guessing the editor's first language wasn't English. Not a far stretch considering neither was the author, but some of the words they use are outdated, ie. gaoler, instead of jailer. Other than that, very good story.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This movie is perfect to follow from the first one. It will have you laughing just as hard if not harder than the first one.

B00003CXXM|5.0|The Bourn Identity is a pretty good action film.  To give you a brief idea of the storyline- a man wakes up in the ocean (Matt Damon's character) has absolutely NO idea where he is, realizes he doesn't remember anything from the past two weeks prior to the incident, meets an attractive young woman while in the city, and they both spend the entire time running from the police around Germany and France.    While it's a pretty easy plotline to follow, it unfortunately does contain some unsatisfyingly dry and quiet moments that feel really tacked on and unnecessary, dragging the overall score down a few notches.    Also, I was never really sure whether Damon's character had superhero strengths, or whether these devastating moves of his were just your typical far-fetched action segments on the part of the Hollywood directors.  I'm not necessarily complaining about it- just wondering if those power moves he was delivering to the bad guys had an explanation of some sorts, or were we not supposed to acknowledge Damon's amazing power?    Lots of shooting, fighting, and yes, even some romance scenes take up a good portion of The Bourn Identity.  Not a bad film however.
0316069884|4.0|Like author Jonathan Safran Foer, I have flip-flopped for years with the idea of being vegetarian. I've always thought of myself as not committed enough to make the effort to look at the contents of all of my food to figure out whether I'm able to eat it. I am also really uncomfortable with making other people change their menu for me, so I usually just eat whatever is prepared. I've never ever thought of myself as a vegetarian, but I do go through phases where I'm disgusted with the idea of meat. When I picked up \\"Eating Animals\\" it was only because it sounded interesting, but after reading it I feel more compelled to stop eating meat than ever before.<br /><br />Yes, there is much discussion of the suffering of animals in here, but Foer also talks about the environmental effects as well as the possibilities for widespread infections caused by the conditions of factory farming. These two factors are what have really compelled me to question whether eating meat is really worth the effects it is having on our world.<br /><br />Foer also discusses the conscientious farmers and slaughterhouses that make eating meat seem like a viable option. Unfortunately, these \\"old school\\" farmers are being put out of business in droves by the giant factory farming operations. This alone makes this book worthwhile reading because it explains how eating locally and knowing where your food comes from can help to make informed decision about the meat we do choose to eat.<br /><br />While this book gets a little tedious toward the end, I found it a good and interesting read. I was especially impressed with the first chapter of the book in which Foer explains his reasons for looking into this subject in the first place and talks about his own struggles with the decision to become a vegetarian over the years. The discussion about why we eat some animals (cows, pigs, fish, etc.) and not others (dogs, cats, etc.) was something that really stuck with me.

B0034G4P7G|3.0|In my opinion some of the reviews I've read are exaggerated. Someone mentioned that it is the best film of 2010 which I find a bit far-fetched. Maybe it is just me but I found this movie to be average. Good but not great. It felt to me more like the sort of story that could have been told in a magazine article rather than a whole movie. I enjoyed it and there were good dialogues. It was intriguing to discover how facebook was born and the controvrersy that surrounded it but to me the movie is over hyped.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. The acting was great, the film itself looked great and moved very fluidly, the plot was cute and well-written (if not totally original), and the characters are WONDERFUL. I liked Gru, Vector was amusing, the kids were sweet...but the minions own the movie. They were absolutely hilarious and adorable to boot! I want one. I'm 27 years old and I was squealing like a 5-year-old throughout the whole thing. I left the theater feeling great and laughing, and I told myself I HAD to own this movie when it came out on DVD. I can watch it over and over again, and each time I see something new. I laugh my way through each viewing and am trying to show the movie to as many people as possible. It's a fantastic family film that everyone should enjoy!

B0046MOVD0|5.0|To begin, movies based on video games will never be as good as the video games, they are homage to a great franchise, but Resident Evil has done the best I think. Also to be noted, many thought that there were many things not explained or didn't make sense in this film installment. However, it MUST be known that in this particular movie, elements are ripped straight out of the game, mostly from Resident Evil 5. If you have played Resident Evil 5, this movie was made for you. RE5 is where the Executioner came from, Las Plagas (the new zombies), the device found stuck to Claire, Wesker's guard dogs that split in half, and his super powers, all the way down to his outfit, some of his dialogue and action moves: ALL from RE5. The way he tosses around Chris and Claire during the ending fight is the same as the game too. If you have not played RE5, Afterlife may seem confusing or random. The climactic scene with fighting Wesker could have been longer, but was still done fairly well. This movie was more directed toward the diehard fans (like me) I think, which is why those of us who have played the game don't need anything explained. We know Chris (well portrayed by Wentworth Miller) and we know Claire, and we definitely know Wesker. We know all about Las Plagas and how deadly that Executioner's axe can be. If anything, this movie should make you want to play the games. There will definitely be a fifth movie (judging by the end of Afterlife) and I am excited because all diehard fans should be. Perhaps the moviemakers decided to cater more to the long-time fans this time, and I shout out a big thank you to that! :)

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Just not one of Dan Brown's better efforts. Prone to extreme exaggeration, the unbelievable story was borderline asinine at points. I found myself yelling out loud \\"Really?!\\" several times while reading it. I felt like he ran out of good ideas and therefore jotted down whatever came into his head rather than giving it some real critical analysis. The payoff at the end just sputters for all the build up over the first few hundred pages. Not worth your valuable time.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|These head phones have a constant hissing sound and pick up noise from things like scrolling the mouse, and yes the mute was on. If the mute is off the mic will pick up mouse clicks and other background sounds very easily. It seems to be getting some kind of feed back from the electronics in the computer so I would think this is a poorly designed product. I took the first one back and got a new one but it had the same problem. I hooked this up to my PS3 and had the same issues. When sliding the USB in or out it picks up a lot of noise, popping sounds. I also noticed that the padding in top of the head band is a little on the hard side when wearing them for over an hour or so. I could adjust it so the headphones road a little higher on my head but it always kept happening.     Other than the problems mentioned the sound is good from music and games, and it has a long cord. The mic also seemed to work very well.     They just need to better QC their products before shipping them out. Maybe they just had a bad batch but I wont buy another turtle beach product again.
0805079831|5.0|I am currently reading the Shock Doctrine ... As a 51 yr old women I am Shocked at how much I really did not know about how horribly our country has treated other countries in the name of Democracy. What is even more frightening is that the same Corporations are doing the same thing to this country right under our noses. If you are frustrated with what is happening to our country and world for that matter you have to read this book. I can not praise it more highly it is full of references and best of all it Names Names. You will unfortunately recognize most of them and they are still big players. I found this idea in the book that surely spells out what is happening in our own country now. ...more palatable kind of authoritarianism,a civilian coup d'etat,one carried out by politicians and economists in business suits rather than soldiers in military uniforms-all unfolding within the official shell of a democratic regime.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|I ordered this after viewing a rental.  In terms of content, this movie is something of a \\"sheep in wolf's clothing\\".  It presents a story about sex, but thematically, it's really far more about the pressures and anxieties that build up around relationships about the opposite sex.  In these terms, there are moments that are genuinely poignant. Also, it doesn't do much to editorialize about religion or morals (other than satirizing general double-standards and hypocrisy), which I think makes it easier to appreciate.    David N. Brown  Mesa, Arizona

1439177783|5.0|Eating disorders are at an all-time high, and for some reason, we're not making a dent in getting the numbers down (that I know of).  The media and entertainment and fasion industries continue to portray skinny women as the norm, and women of all ages try to achieve what they think is the perfect body by being bone skinny.  I am not knocking anyone personally who might be underweight, but when you look at their bodies, there is no form.  No hips, barely any breasts, and not much of a waist.  Whatever happened to the ideal hourglass figure?      Portia speaks from the heart and leaves no stones unturned.  She is very honest about what she went through, how it affected her health, and her relationships.  I hope more women who have been through this will start speaking out so that maybe, just maybe, women (especially young girls) will get it into their heads that being skinny is not healthy.      I would highly recommend that all women read her book so that hopefully they might learn from her experiences.  The younger the woman to read it, the better (as long as she's old enough to understand the material).  Once an eating disorder starts, it's very difficult to overcome.  If we can reach young girls before they get it into their heads that skinny is having the perfect body, the better their chances of growing up with a healthy body image.
0142414999|4.0|Three famous and accomplished YA writers write three slightly interconnecting Christmas romance novellas that make for a feel-good read in the month of December, curled up next to the fireplace with a mug of hot chocolate beside you, marshmallows melting on the top.<br /><br />Maureen Johnson's story, \\"The Jubilee Express,\\" was my favorite of the three. In the story, the unfortunately named Jubilee's plans to spend Christmas with her overachieving boyfriend get tossed aside for a blizzard-stranded train and a sweet guy she meets in the town she's stranded in. Jubilee's voice is that perfect level of wryness that makes for scads of laughter while also moving the plot right along. It's incredible how much character development occurs within a hundred or so pages, but Noah's jerky personality and Stuart's genuine nice-guy charm gradually reveal themselves to provide a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. 4/5<br /><br />Too often YA romances are predictable: you know who the MC is going to end up with practically the first time the love interest appears in the story. Me, I like romances that surprise me, which the one in John Green's \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle\\" managed to do, much to my delight. I was a little underwhelmed by the gag-humor antics--the sliding car, the bully chase, etc.--and instead focused my attention on how wonderfully subtly Tobin's own little Christmas miracle develops. It's treat enough to make tolerable the wade through the occasionally ridiculous scenarios that Tobin and his friends have to wade through in order to deliver Twister to the cheerleaders in the middle of a snowstorm. 3.5/5<br /><br />I was least in like with the final story, \\"The Patron Saint of Pigs\\" by Lauren Myracle. As mentioned before, the stories in LET IT SNOW are slightly interconnected, and so the glimpses I got of the two main characters prior to reading this story just didn't gel with the way they were presented in \\"Pigs.\\" Addie is definitely self-involved (and could her friends tell her that more often?), and so at times I found myself questioning why a guy as apparently wonderful as Jeb could've fallen for her, as well as wanting to smack her. However, she also undergoes growth in the story--albeit in a \\"sudden revelation from the heavens\\" kind of manner--so all's well that ends well, I suppose. 3/5<br /><br />Overall, LET IT SNOW is a wonderful addition to the avid YA reader's already bursting book collection. You really can't go wrong with any of these authors, especially when they write a light-hearted holiday read.more often?), and so at times I found myself questioning why a guy as apparently wonderful as Jeb could've fallen for her, as well as wanting to smack her.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|Miracle on 34th Street is a classic not only because of the attractive characters, the fantasy ending, the humor, but also because of certain structural subtleties which are not noticed by the casual viewer.    The movie consists of a series of threats to Kris Kringle and a series of events which neutralize those threats.     In the first place, once hired as Macy's Santa, Kris starts sending customers to other stores. When Thelma Ritter (perfectly cast) tells him he shouldn't have promised her son a fire engine (\\"Macy's hasn't got 'em, nobody's got 'em\\") Kris replies, \\"You don't think I would have promised the boy unless I was sure, do you? You can get those fire engines at Schoenfeld's, an excellent bargain.\\"    Mr. Schellhammer, the manager of the toy department, overhears this and is horrified. He is on the point of firing Kris when Thelma Ritter walks up to him and congratulates Macy's on \\"this wonderful new stunt you're pullin'.\\" So Schellhammer has to think twice about firing Kris.     Meanwhile Mr. Gailey (who will eventually be Kris's attorney) takes Maureen O'Hara's daughter Susie to see Kris. When Susie overhears Kris speaking Dutch to a little Dutch girl, her skepticism (inculcated in her by her cynical mother) is challenged. Doris responds to this by firing Kris.    No sooner has this happened than Schellhammer tells Doris about Kris sending customers to other stores. Mr. Macy is excited about the idea, so they both have to un-fire Kris.    So much for the first threat to Kris.    The second threat comes when Mr. Sawyer, Macy's psychologist, takes a dislike to Kris and tells Doris he has to be fired. But this threat is neutralized by the doctor from the old people's home on Long Island who comes into Doris's office and says Sawyer is exaggerating, Kris \\"only wants to be friendly and helpful.\\" Despite Sawyer's snide denial of this, Kris remains as Santa and even engineers a handshake between Macy and Gimble.    At this point we might think that Kris is free and clear, there are no more conflicts. But the movie would be boring without the third and most dramatic conflict.    When Kris finds out that Sawyer is psychoanalyzing Alfred, the innocent boy who pushes a broom at Macy's and likes to play Santa Claus, Kris hits Sawyer on the head with his cane. Sawyer pretends the injury is serious and gets Kris committed to Belleview.    This sets up the climax of the movie. Gailey tells the judge (Gene Lockhart) that he intends to prove that Kris IS Santa Claus.     The judge would throw the case out, but William Frawley (perfectly cast as his political adviser) says, \\"You go ahead and rule there's no Santy Claus. Wait til the candy companies, the Christmas tree companies, the toy companies hear about this. You're gonna be an awful popular fellow.\\"    The judge sees the problem, and rules that the belief in Santa Claus is open to debate, a matter of opinion. \\"I will hear arguments on both sides.\\"    The District Attorney rests his case after asking Kris, \\"Do you really believe you're Santa Claus?\\" and Kris answers \\"Of course.\\"    Now it is up to Gailey to prove that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus. This he cannot do. The Mayor, the Governor, refuse to put in writing that Kris is Santa Claus.    In a touching moment Gailey puts Mr. Macy on the stand. \\"Do you believe this man is Santa Claus?\\" Macy ponders. He sees newspaper headlines saying \\"MACY ADMITS HIS SANTA IS A FRAUD.\\" Then he see the happy faces of the children whose lives Kris has touched, and humbly says \\"I do.\\" Applause in the courtroom.    Now for the tour de force of the movie. Gailey is stuck. No person in authority will publicly say Kris is Santa.    We cut to Susie writing a letter to Kris addressed to the courthouse. \\"I hope you are not sad. I believe you really are Santa Claus.\\" Doris appends to the letter, \\"I believe in you too.\\"    The letter arrives at the post office, where Jack Albertson suddenly gets the idea of sending all the letters written bySanta to the courthouse. Gailey introduces the letters as proof that a government agency certifies that Kris is Santa Claus. The judge, relieved to be off the hot seat (and the multiple shots of Bill Frawley pointing his cigar at the judge, now warningly, now approvingly, are hilarious), rules, \\"If the U.S. Post Office says Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus, this court will not dispute it.\\"    The letter from Susie is overdetermined in two ways: first, its content goes to the cynicism she has learned from her mother, which Kris has now overcome. Secondly, the letter sets up the happy ending.    So MIRACLE is one of the most intricately structured movies ever made, along with perhaps THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. Every scene is overdetermined, with meanings reaching down to the thematic depths of the story while driving the action forward.    A great example of film structure at its best.

B000UFAURI|5.0|I am an avid listener of Foo Fighters and have been listening to their music for some time. I must say, this is their best album yet. From the kick ass track \\"Let it Die\\" to the melancholy song \\"Home\\" this album has the listener's attention from beginning to end. I see this album as the peak of the Foo Fighters creativity and musical ability all wrapped into an amazing album.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|I actually purchased this album after listening to only one of the 30-second demo tracks...  It must have been the right track, because after listening to the entire album, I am still enjoying listening to it over and over again; most of that time in the car going to work.  Being a guitar player, I have always enjoyed listening to various riffs that are played in the songs written by Mark Knopfler.  I have also used Mark's music for my guitar students to demonstrate different artist's styles.  Overall, just some good easy listening by a talented musician.

I checked out the sequel from the library too but I got \\"Linger\\" for Christmas.<br /><br />It's a beautiful and extremely interesting love story. Maggie wrote a beautiful book. She makes you feel like you're the one she's talking about. The chapters aren't labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 etc... they're labeled as viewpoints as \\"Sam\\" and \\"Grace\\", which I hadn't enjoyed reading such books like that before but it's actually nice to \\"feel\\" what Grace AND Sam are feeling. In the second book the chapters grow to include other characters. I highly suggest reading this book. I think any girl or women would like. Unfortunately, I doubt many boys or men would enjoy it.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|I haven't read this book yet (I'm halfway through The Goblet of Fire), but I saw the movie in the theater and have watched it a couple of times since. Therefore, I can only comment on the film itself and can't compare it to the book. Any comparisons to previous films in the series will be based solely on the films themselves, not the books.<br /><br />An important thing to know about this film is that it was directed by David Yates, the director of the final four of the eight Harry Potter films (including the forthcoming second part of The Deathly Hallows). The Order of the Phoenix was the first one he directed, and it continued the trend of increasingly darker and more adult-oriented Potter films. That approach is carried through to this film, which is more somber, moody, and dramatic than any of the previous films. Where the first five films were fanciful and fun, containing plenty of big action set pieces, THBP has a tone of sobriety brought on by the ever-growing threat of Voldemort and his Death Eaters to not only the Dumbledore-defended Hogwarts, but the Muggle and wizarding worlds at large. Without launching into a plot synopsis, I will say that the film strikes a solid balance between teen-movie-styled romantic and school drama, the broader saving-the-world mystery epic surrounding Voldemort, and a cloak-and-dagger subplot involving the Death Eaters, Snape and Draco Malfoy, resulting in the death of a certain important character. As always, there is a special-effects laden climax to this film, but it is hardly the spectacular, extensive knock-down, drag-out wizard battle of The Order of the Phoenix. However, you do get to see Dumbledore use some kick-ass magic at the end of a heart-wrenching scene during which he faces perhaps his greatest challenge ever.<br /><br />If the proverbial s*** was beginning to hit the fan during the previous (TOOTP) film, it was nothing compared to the terror and despair that this film portends for Harry, Ron and Hermoine. As a matter of fact, the excellent, harrowing The Deathly Hallows Part 1 frankly blows this film out of the water in many ways, but THBP remains the best of the first six. By this point, the filmmakers and actors had deeper, more psychologically complex material to work with, not to mention lots of practice working within the logic of J.K. Rowling's world. Therefore, just about everything in this film is a step up from the previous five, which is saying something when you're talking about a film series that consistently achieves a surprisingly high level of quality across the board. The performances this time around are particularly remarkable, especially when it comes to Alan Rickman as Snape.<br /><br />This review comes with a minor warning, however. If it has not already been made clear, this film is a different beast from the first five, despite it's relatively close adherence to the overall structure of those films. Many people were disappointed by the lack of action and complained that \\"not much happened\\". Happily, these criticisms simply miss the point - for what it is, this is an excellent film. It's not supposed to be an action blockbuster, however it may have been marketed during the summer leading up to its release. So watch this one and then enjoy the big payoff supplied by The Deathly Hallows Part 1, and, presumably, Part 2.he excellent, harrowing The Deathly Hallows Part 1 frankly blows this film out of the water in many ways, but THBP remains the best of the first six.

1400079144|2.0|Dan Brown's formula for grinding out best sellers is wearing thin. In fact, if it weren't for the Google search engine and Wikipedia, his latest venture into eclectic esoterica would have been a long-winded disaster. Instead it serves as an entertaining pointer to a good collection of little-know factoids associated with Washington DC. However, sprinkling these into an alphabet soup of \\"archetypal hybrids\\" and serving it to his readers on a platter of new age Gnosticism with Masonic trimmings is pretty bland fare.    Unfortunately for Brown's readers, Umberto Eco is much more adept at creating a story line around the mysteries of Masons, Neal Stephenson's forays into code-cracking make Brown's seem like child's play, and almost anyone could improve on Brown's character development. Wikileaks are currently providing many more shocking revelations than anything in this story. Brown does have an eye for good art, but I'd recommend that he spend a lot more time with Albrecht Dürer than Constantino Brumidi (look them up in Wikipedia if you haven't read the book).    When creating a recipe for success, a good chef will tell you that too many ingredients will spoil the meal. Brown didn't get that memo and threw the oxymoron of \\"noetic science\\" into the mix. This resulted in the largest storyline gone awry in the whole novel. As clever as he is at drawing connections between disparate material, Brown simply can't plausibly align this with any other plot element and essentially abandons it midway through the book. He does attempt to bring it back in the last chapters which serve as a long infomercial promoting his \\"new world order of expanded consciousness\\" after the story grinds to a halt. It doesn't work.    When this inevitably is released as a movie starring Tom Hanks as the clueless protagonist, I wonder whether patrons will be allowed to bring their iPads into the theater to Google concepts while watching. The search results may hold their interest better than the bigscreen.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The series starts slowly. I was a little disapointed at first because all the battle scenes were at night and in the dark. You couldn't grasp what was really happening to the characters in the movie. But as the series progressed the battle scenes began to be fought in daylight. The Pacific achieved a tremendous balance between the soldiers romantic love's and the grim aspects of fighting and death on the battlefield. Some battles were won and some were lost in both respects. This is a very powerful series. The ability to create a war on film and do it right is no easy task. How do I know they got it right? Because my husband is a Vietnam vet and it bothered him to watch some of the scenes. Not because the scenes were too bloody. It was because the realistic sights and sounds brought back too many bad memories. The loss of buddies that fought next to you and the fatigue of war in general. It's all there and more. This is well worth purchasing and sharing. Hats off to Speilburg and Hanks, again.
B0000549B0|5.0|This is a great movie, it's how we wish we could act around people, without a care in the world.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is one where from the very first page I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a day and a half. I loved every bit of it! I really liked how the characters devolped; with each page I learned a little more about each one. By the end of the book I had perfect images in my head of what each person looked like. I also liked how there wasn't any vampires involved in the book. I think that almost every book that contains werewolves, also contains vampires. But not this one! If you are a Team Edward person, this probably isn't the best book for you to read. Shiver exceded my expectations! I actually thought I wasn't going to enjoy it, but I loved it! Enjoy!!

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Everything and more that you could want from one of the best shows ever on TV, too good for TV, too good for us most of the time.  The quality is stunning and I for one am glad I got it when I did; if you're a fan and don't have this yet at the low, low prices here, then, hey, you are really missing out!    So say I, you all.
B004EC937G|5.0|Fun, upbeat, downbeat, catty, and yeah melancholy all in one CD...    Really just a fun CD with many moods, upbeat sounds on a few tracks, a few slow and melancholy songs like the exquisite \\"Hard For the Heart\\".  And yes I did say catty referring to a few tracks especially the \\"Girl and \\"My Boy\\", where Duffy warns \\"you better stay away and find your own..\\"    Over all this is a fun catchy CD with some note worthy songs. I recommend it for a fun night in with dim lights and a good martini by your side. You might be surprised and end up dancing to some of the songs.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Who cares what the stuffy broadway reviewers think?  This is a terrific family film!  The music of Annie is such a delightful reminder of my childhood, singing the songs with my sister in our living room, and I'm thrilled to share Annie with my daughter.  She loves this as a kids' movie, and as an adult, I can appreciate the performances of Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters in a way that I couldn't as a child.  Don't hesitate -- buy this dvd and enjoy it!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|My parents were excited to receive this set as a gift.  I was excited that it arrived before Christmas!
B003R0LBVW|1.0|This book was suggested to me by a book club member who is also a friend.    I found the book to be rambling and all over the place about these people.    Their points of view about their neighbors seemed petty. They seemed about   skin deep. I immediately felt the author's predjudice towards people who are supposedly   conservative, representing these people in a not true negative light.  I found it difficult to care about any of these folks and their actions.  I am a 52 year old Mother with two young adult children, I also have a teenage   son with a disability. I feel the people I know my age are more well rounded  caring people with lots more to offer the world in the year 2010.  Probably representative of Oprah and her not so pizazz for the current world.  Or perhaps her disconnect with, sorry Oprah. Also sorry the book costs so much!  If one reads this borrow it for free from your local library,save your money.    Not so delited Person, Mom, or human.
030746363X|2.0|I had a terrible time focusing on the material within this book, without psychoanalyzing the author the entire time.  Tim Ferris displays symptoms of textbook narcissism with an obsessive compulsive disorder.  This book is entirely based on his own self-absorption and superficiality.  If the energy he utilized for the past 10 years experimenting on himself was put into real problem solving, perhaps he could have made more of a contribution to society than just how to have a great posterior or 5% body fat.  Is that what we've really come down to in this country?  With that said there is some good information that has been collected, but reader beware: it is not original nor is it groundbreaking.  The message is also only as good as it is delivered.  In this case Ferris is repetitive, contradictory and somewhat self righteous.  You'll need to decipher what is for you and what is not, and to his credit, Ferris does say that.  However, unless you are totally consumed with yourself image, I would advise against purchasing this book.  Had I not received this as gift I would return it.
B000093FLA|4.0|This is a fast past movie with a ridiculous plot about a diamond theft.  It's very Guy Ritchie stylized and incredibly funny.  Somehow it is also meaningful.  You will like the characters.  Any Guy Ritchie movie made after this one feels like Guy Ritchie trying to imitate himself.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Great movie and even better on Blu-Ray.  Can't beat the price and free shipping.  Also, bonus instant viewing on Amazon.
B000002U82|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time.  I don't think I'm qualified to review this specific album, but to me it is a very amazing experience.  It doesn't disappoint.  Also, watching it synced with 'The Wizard of Oz' - The Darkside of Oz' - with my friends ranks as one of the best movie watching experiences of my life.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I received this game for Christmas and could not put it down.  I played through it multiple times to get every ending (none of the repetition was boring).  I stayed up until four in the morning finishing the final, \\"true,\\" ending.  And I never stay up that late for anything.  Ever.    Seriously, do yourself a favor and get this game.  It's incredible.
1563890410|5.0|Dream has to go to hell.  It tangles the story arc of Dream within other intricate fables of Gods, Angels, and Demons.  The art is wonderful.  Neil Gaiman writes the lives and deaths of characters in such a way that makes you feel genuine.  Don't let anyone tell you these graphic novels are silly.  They may not be for everyone, but I think people who identify with this series will take these later issues to heart.
B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|I swear everytime i  listen to this CD, i find another favorite song to put on repeat. I first fell in love with \\"Blame Game\\" only because i can sadly relate to the song. Now i am feeling \\"All of the lights\\" interlude (a beautiful piece of music, wish it were longer) and \\"All of the lights\\" (song) which is a well crafted song from beginning to end. I also love the flow from all the artist on my 3rd favorite song \\"So Appalled\\". Surprisingly, I wasn't irritated by the Nicki Minaj's part, she actually brought it and held her own on \\"Monster\\". The songs on the cd were well placed throughout the CD, creating specific emotions kanye wanted the listener to feel. While it's not 5 star, (5 star is Michael Jackson Thriller and Off the Wall albums...or Jay Z Reasonable Doubt...or Eric B & Rakim Paid in Full)... It's definitely 4 stars and worth every penny! Chi TOWN for LIFE!!!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|A cornerstone of the 90s alternative rock scene.  It is absolutely one of the best albums I have ever listened to.  It is not forgettable in any way.  Listen to it for the first time while you're busy and it will catch you off guard.  It will make you love Radiohead.

1608870081|5.0|I got this book for my girlfriend,she's a really big fan of HARRY POTTER the book is really cool and the detailing is really nice,though for little kid's parent's they  should note that the pages should be opened carefully as not to damage the scene's. Also AMAZON price is good my local book store, they wanted 35 bucks for it here it was like 19 bucks on this site,I also bought her the film wizardry book also a very nice book got them both for about 45 bucks.So in all 2 great books for the HARRY POTTER fan! THANKS AMAZON!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|D for dorky review title.  This is a great movie.  Very violent.  Just british enough to be american.  Based on a graphic novel by alan moore, so the plot is very good.  Who doesn't want to watch someone try to blow up parliament?

B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is a movie that is specifically chaotic.  It takes you into the depths of purposeful destruction and mayhem.  It is a cult classic that has grown to be a favorite.  You will not forge the first time you watched Fight Club.  Ed Norton is an amazing narrator and Brad Pitt is the face of unabashed constructive insanity.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|We couldn't find this movie in any stores.  We found it on Amazon for a great price!  Fast delivery.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I liked this movie a lot.  The blu ray goes unnoticed for a lot of the movie, but you really remember how amazing it looks during scenes with either fire or water, and for the better part of half an hour, there is a lot of fire and water.  The movie is funny and well paced.  I feel like they could have handled things a little better.  Maybe bumped it up to a PG-13 with some more wizard violence, and I feel like it suffers from hindsight after reading the 7th book.  I wanted a book that really captured the wizard edginess of the book, but it smoothed some edges.  However, overall, it needs to be in your HP collection anyway, so get over it and buy it on bluray because it will look cool on your TV and fit really well in your drawer.

B00275EHJQ|5.0|There's something magical about growing up with the characters from Toy Story.  Toy Story takes the richness of the universe it created and has given it a wonderful conclusion.  Many people I know cried when they watched it.  I didn't, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun, fast-paced, funny, family friendly (in a good way) film.  And it looks really great on bluray.

B0025VLELQ|5.0|This movie is a classic for people who can say they watched it when they were kids or at least during a time when computer generated effects were non-existent.  This movie was one of the first to attempt it.  It's definitely a movie.  It has a very interesting plot.  It plays sort of like a typical sci-fi movie, expect the sci-fi plot is in the background for most of the movie, and the highlighted plot is about this kid having to deal with the fact that he is really awesome at video games and they need him to be really awesome at saving a planet... with a spaceship.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Sit back and let all of the Holiday stress evaporate with this wonderful collection from James Taylor.  His take on Holiday classics brings a fresh and jazzy (at times) version on many favorites.  JT's \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" is one of the best I've ever heard.  \\"In The Bleak Midwinter\\" is a song I have never heard before.  It is beautiful and I've played it over and over.  You can't go wrong with this great CD.
0930289234|5.0|This book is *necessary* for a graphic novel collection.  Alan Moore may be crazy, but he is genius at writing.  It's not expensive.  Buy it.  Or borrow it from somewhere.  Read it.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|I thought this was the best animated movie that my 5 year old son and I saw this year! He really thought it was funny and so did I. The 3D was great! Much better than Toy Story 3 and Megamind.

0446677450|1.0|I love financial literacy books, and I had to try Rich Dad Poor Dad.  In general the book is like most finincial help books, repetitive and vague.  Nothing was even suggested to the reader to try until half way through the book.  All the tactics the author suggests are high risk, which I don't have a problem with, except for the fact that he claims with financial education these tactics become low risk?  The odds of you winning the lottery do not increase with practice...  Overall the author comes off as arrogant and obnoxious.  The book puts a fun twist on the idea of a day job and the concept of money, but overall this book is a waste of paper that makes this arrogant author more obnoxiously wealthy.  Buy this book if you would like to widen the gap between the rich and poor :)
0618001905|4.0|Over a century has passed since the events depicted in this book, and the first thing I learned was that-- somewhere along the line-- I had fallen prey to King Leopold II of Belgium's public relations team. For quite a long time, Leopold was known as a great humanitarian. The real King Leopold was quite horrifying.<br /><br />In the 1880s while Europe carved Africa into colonies to harvest as much of the continent's natural resources as possible, King Leopold II (who scathingly referred to his own country as \\"small country, small people\\") was frantic not to be excluded from the feast. The vast colony he seized in 1885 as his private fiefdom included most of the unexplored basin of the Congo River.<br /><br />Leopold then proceeded to put in place a reign of terror that would end in the deaths of four to eight million people-- a genocide of Holocaust proportions. Those indigenous peoples who survived went to work mining ore or harvesting rubber while Leopold squirreled away billions of dollars in hidden bank accounts around the world.<br /><br />Although the king's ministers tried to keep a very tight lid on what was really going on in the Congo, the word began to get out and circulate to a wider and wider audience, due mainly to men willing to risk their jobs, their reputations and their lives in order to put an end to the atrocities. Their efforts to expose these crimes led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century.<br /><br />The strength of Hochschild's book is that he uses the wealth of information that can be found in actual eyewitness accounts.  I have to admit that I had to read this book in short doses. Normally I am not squeamish, but as I read what Leopold sanctioned in order to reap untold wealth-- all the while painting himself as a great and wise humanitarian-- I became sickened.<br /><br />There are those who may read of the genocides in Africa in recent decades and think, \\"So what? It's just one tribe wiping out another tribe. There are plenty more to take their places. It's not as though white people are being murdered.\\" Once again, a piece of forgotten history shows us that the indigenous peoples of Africa learned all about genocide... from the \\"civilized\\" whites.<br /><br />As painful as this book can be to read, I'm glad I read it-- and I hope you consider reading it as well.es.

1423134206|4.0|Received the book, much bigger and more comprehensive in terms of range of movies covered. The book is gorgeous showing a few pages (usually no more than 6-8) per show. The movie covers visual development work (design) of characters, environments, color studies, and props from Disney studios' earliest shorts right up to Tangled (their most recent movie). I was surprised by the inclusion of some of the material in the book: rare stuff like the concept art for Lorenzo, The Little Match Girl and other shorts. Keep in mind, since it covers so many shows the selections are limited, but a good buy for any fan of this type of material. Its very low on text, which is fine, it is definitely a visual experience.
B002GJT4XW|3.0|The movie isn't really that much different from the extended version. The box is kind of nice, but unless you have it out where people can see, what does that matter?    I got this for two reasons: 1) It was supposed to have lots of new scenes, and 2) the digital copy.    The \\"new scenes\\" are okay. Most seem to be the deleted scenes and such from other versions of the movie I already had.    The digital copy is a bust. I received the DVDs on the very day they expired, but the system still would not let me download them. I emailed customer service, and got a completely unsatisfactory answer. Basically, if you want their digital copy, don't count on them to give it to you. I now had a useless DVD in a pretty box sitting on a shelf where nobody can see it unless they to looking for it.    Was it worth the money? Probably not. Unless, that is, you feel like you have to collect everything. But don't think you are getting a \\"deal\\" when you get it.
1926778103|1.0|I have no idea what the publisher was thinking when they published this book. As soon as I received the book and opened it, it was obvious this book would fall apart if you decided to open the book fully. I honestly think there should be a recall on the book. It is that bad. I haven't seen anything this bad since purchasing one of James Jean's books ( the calendar one). Just sad.  I had to give it 1 star since the binding has rendered the book useless. The publisher owes all the artists whose works appear in the book and all the people that enthusiastically purchased this book an apology. The art and the amount of it would have garnered a 5 from me if the binding was anywhere near what it should have been.  Some may think 1 star is harsh, but a book is meant to be looked through, and concept books especially. This one you can not.
B000JIHP88|5.0|The mobile is so cute and so interesting, that my baby girl cannot take her eyes off this. Easy to assemble, I have only two \\"BUTs\\" :    One out of 3 leaves is not working. Doesnt move up and down, unless I poke it. ALso, the plastic screw that you attach the mobile to the crib with, is way too long. My crib is way too far from a wall.     Other than that - I would recommend it to everyone.     thanks
B0015AARJI|4.0|I've been the owner of this game for more than a  year and:    Pros:  + Battery's life is great.  + Charging USB cord is long enough  + Unlike the Xbox 360 controller, this controller has the  Up, Down, Left and Right buttons separated, now I wont fail when pressing the one I wanna press.  + Lightweight.    Cons:  - L2 and R2 triggers are bad. When I put my controller on the couch, it accidentally presses by itself, and I kill myself with a grenade while playing Call of Duty 4.  - It may be painful for some users that have really big hands, because the ring finger is pressed really hard.  - It's like a children's controller, the Xbox 360 controller is more confortable to carry    Overall, I recommend this product
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I already owned this movie and adored it. I ordered another one for my grandmother. I had let her watch mine because I loved it so much and knew she would too. Well she did so I ordered her one for Christmas. I would highly recommend MovieMars to anyone. When I am planning to order a DVD on Amazon I always try to order from them. They are great.
B0001US62I|5.0|One of my top 3 male actors of today? Robert DeNiro. This man transforms himself into whatever character he plays, over and over again. The plot of this particular movie makes it so good to me, and the cry, \\"I know who I am\\" by Mickey Rourke's character made me feel so bad for him. Lisa Bonet got into hot water with Bill Cosby over her role in this movie - love you Bill, but she had a great part. The physical condition of the dvd is excelent, as with all of the other media that I have purchased from Amazon.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I'll be honest, I ordered this movie because it had Gerard Butler in it. LOL I'm so glad I ordered it because I absolutely love it. It is my new favorite and I can and have watched it over and over and over again. It just doesn't get old. It's such a sweet story. I would highly recommend it. Also, I ordered it from MovieMars on Amazon and have ordered several DVDs from them and they are awesome. I always look to buy from them when I want to order a DVD because they usually have one of the lowest prices and their service is fantastic. I've never had any problems with them.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My husband was so excited to get his gift, and he has nearly finished watching it. The TV series arrived just as described and in good timing too.
1439177783|2.0|Yes it was a well-written book. It had some interesting insights, if not as much as I would have liked.    But it troubled me that throughout the book, de Rossi's little dog Bean was mostly depicted as an afterthought, an accessory living in a handbag or satchel or whatever she chose to cart him around in at any given time.    Silly of me to be upset by this, you say? Maybe.    And do I really think she never, never played with him or treated him as a good owner should treat his/her faithful companion?     Oh, I imagine she did sometimes. You just could not tell it from this book. And the book is all I have to go on.    de Rossi depicted herself as so self-absorbed, it didn't sound like there was any time in her busy day to give the dog the time and attention a dog alone deserves.     For someone who claimed that stopping the eating of flesh made her more spiritual and connected to living things, de Rossi's comments about loving and appreciating her animals--not Bean, no mention of Bean, but Mae and her animals of today, apparently--left a bad taste in my mouth.  If I recall correctly, Bean ended up mauled and killed by a coyote after de Rossi moved in with Francesca.     Again, I can only go by what I read in the book, and based on that, I can't feel too good about de Rossi's character, and it keeps me from giving this book more stars.    Just my opinion. YMMV
0385737955|4.0|This is more like a 3.5, but I don't want to put it in the same lot as some other books I have in the 3 star section.<br /><br />The Maze Runner starts off a bit slow for my liking, with a lot of the writing focusing on Thomas's interactions with the boys of the Glade. This is probably the one thing that brought the book down a few notches in my opinion, because it took up so much of the story and it was so irritating to read. Thomas is such an unlikable character for the most part. He is the new guy in a situation that hardly anyone really understands, but he persists on basically being a jerk for the first one-hundred and fifty pages or so. He's determined on escaping the maze, but it's like he can't understand the fact that the other Gladers have been trying for two years now. They say it's impossible to try through one method, but it takes him a good while to actually believe them. He nearly dies more than once despite their warnings and it was almost hilarious at times to read about him realizing that maybe he should have listened to the Gladers before he went and did something stupid. He also had a strange issue with never making up his mind on his fellow Gladers. He hated certain characters from the beginning, then liked them, then respected them, then hated them again. Take Chuck, for example: He's written out to be an annoying little kid (although this is told to you by Thomas, never really shown, so as the reader you never actually feel annoyed with Chuck as a character) but he enjoys being around Thomas and keeping him company, except that Thomas keeps flipping around in the way he thinks of Chuck from the beginning to the end, \\"Thomas felt a pang of guilt over Chuck--felt sorry for him. The kid tried so hard to be everyone's friend, but no one seemed to like him or even pay attention to him. Yeah, he was a little excitable and talked too much, but Thomas was glad enough to have him around.\\" (105) He considers this after a hundred pages of expressing his annoyance over Chuck and then continues on for another two hundred pages of continuing to express his annoyance of Chuck. It's as though the author didn't want you to think Thomas hated Chuck, despite the fact that nearly everything else Thomas thought or said told you he could barely stand the boy. It's not as bad with the other characters, but there are situations in which Thomas's feelings towards others can change three times in one paragraph, and it made for really choppy and inconsistent characterizations.<br /><br />And I want to throw in a general little complaint here on YA novels: Why is it that stubbornness is so commonly found to be the most prominent characteristic of the protagonist? Thomas was so ridiculously stubborn in this novel it was almost comical.<br /><br />While the writing isn't terrible, a little bit of editing would've helped clear up some repetitive sentences. At almost any instance in which a character or a situation was disagreeable, the author seemed to enjoy repeating the words, \\"Thomas was sick of (blank)\\" Thomas was sick of not getting answers, sick of Chuck, sick of Alby, sick of Newt, sick of the maze, and so on. \\"Thomas was shocked\\" was also in there so many times that I nearly feel the urge to go back and count them all.  At other times there were just strange sentences that didn't seem to flow with the writing style, like the moment in which Thomas declares, \\"Dinner was awesome.\\" You'd have to read the book to see how it sticks out like a sore thumb because of the word \\"awesome\\" which could have easily been replaced with say, \\"fantastic\\" or \\"incredible\\" without it sounding nearly as strange. Then there was my favorite, \\"Thomas's discouragement grew with every toss, until it turned into a heavy mass of blah.\\"...Yep, that's right, \\"blah\\". His discouragement grew into \\"blah\\". I can't be the only one to consider this sentence a tad bit silly.<br /><br />Despite the strange sentences now and then and my issues with Thomas a character, there was still a lot in this novel that I enjoyed. The minor characters, despite lacking some development, were pretty satisfying now and then. They said the kind of things to Thomas that I wanted to be able to say to Thomas whenever he behaved like an idiot (it made me wonder if the author was making him an idiot on purpose, but he never really makes this clear through all the events of the book, so I'm still unsure) and they reacted appropriately whenever he did not. I often felt myself cheering for characters like Minho and Newt, because they were the most likable of the set and I found myself hoping that things would turn out well for them even though I didn't really care about what could happen to Thomas. I did hope for a little bit more development with characters I liked, but since I didn't get that now I'm hoping I'll get that in the next book.<br /><br />The general plot and string of events is pretty thrilling once things actually get going (it takes a while, but it gets there) and I found myself not wanting to put the book down around the last two hundred pages. The set was intriguing and pretty original as far as my own reading experience goes. Some details in the end are a bit confusing, and I would probably be more irritable with the author over the way he ended things if it weren't for the fact that I have the sequel already available to me.

B00110K62U|5.0|Definitely my favourite Christmas present!    2-CD special edition, with a (old and not hi-def) special 'making of' documentary on Disc 2 -interesting but not a must-have, even for the biggest fan.    The concert itself is just awesome though - filmed in the Royal Albert Hall with a full choir and orchestra, and a dream cast. Absolutely stunning sound, and wonderful to watch and listen to, even someone who hasn't seen the show would get a lot out of it. A gorgeous production.
0439023513|4.0|It's hard to explain what I feel when it comes to this book. Annoyance for the way parts of the plot played out (this part includes me crying a little...maybe). Joy for the way Gale's scenes increased from short lines to full pages. Heartache for the changes characters Gale and Peeta make. This book doesn't really need promoting, so I'll get to the point. This book could have been a one page 2 liner that said Katniss became the Mockingjay, and chose [insert Gale or Peeta]. Then everyone died. I still would have said that this series was one of my favorites. At the end of the day Suzzane Collins is the creator of this world, she can do with it what she wants. I didn't agree with everything    Ex. The reader misses a lot of the action. Like you're in a car, being driven somewhere, but you fall asleep. Therefore, when you wake up, you're already at your destination and you've missed A LOT.    I LOVED some parts    Ex. The character's relationships are tested and prove how powerful and important love and friendship is.    Overall, It still lived up to MOST of my expectations. It made me laugh, cry, and sigh at all the loveable quotes Collins wrote for her characters. Plus, I can live with the ending, so it's all good!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|If you are a Dr Who fan, well, go out there and get it!  I was prepared not to like Matt Smith after David Tennant but I found him to be entertaining and yet another fun Dr Who.  Wish these series would get to the US sooner!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|The White Ribbon is a slow, long and tedious film that tests your patience through grounded and well thought out shots, minimal facial expressions and dialogue moving act a snail's pace.  But, in spite, or perhaps because of this, after the long and ardous journey you make following the characters, the ending is sublime, moving and deeply layered in history.   As the film comes to a close, the difficulty you faced while watching this exquisite film pays off with a lesson about fascism and how, in spite of humanity's best efforts, it can lay siege on innocent people.   I imagine that this film did not win for best foreign feature for the earlier part of my review, but for those who managed to gain all that was offered by Haneke in his portrait of early 20th century Germany, the lack of an oscar becomes meaningless because it is clear the timelessness of the film will prevail.
1400082773|3.0|Written by a young man needing to speak of the world he knows.  I read this book because of the critics.  Only interesting enough to want to see into the the presidents personal history and understand a little of how he arrived at his current perspective.  Also to realize that his critics are generally not interested in what the president is about, but only want to tear down a man who is genuine in his ideas and patriotism, whether you agree with him or not.  I have the feeling the critics did not read the same book I read.  Not interesting enough to read just for the sake of reading pleasure.
1442339586|2.0|As a fan of How I Met Your Mother, I thought \\"The Bro Code\\" would be a fun listen on my commute.  Instead, the audio book falls flat, mainly because its production is devoid of the important context of the show.      Barney Stinson, the ostensible author of \\"The Bro Code,\\" is an over-the-top misogynistic womanizer- essentially a modern iteration of Will Ferrell's Anchorman.  Clearly much of what makes Barney's misogynistic behavior humorous on the tv show is the environment around the character- Barney's friends, the bar scene, and even the audience/laugh track.  This environment lends Barney's character some depth, along with an occasional compassionate moment and/or a significant other.  All of these elements, vital to the character's humor, are missing in the audio book.  Consequently the spotlight is shared between the material and Harris' performance.  And standing alone, the material mostly falls flat.      Instead, we get Neil Patrick Harris attempting to lend the same bravado to the suddenly-tired material in what sounds like a recording studio vacuum.  Instead of a funny conversation with a silly character, the audio book almost seems like a poor lecture.      Skip the audio book; maybe the real book isn't quite so unsettling.  Or maybe just stick to the tv show, and ignore the spin-offs.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The only reason I did not like this book is because it is that last one in the series! It always kept me one my toes just reading for hours and hours at a time.  felt like I was Percy as he battled monsters and concured (sorry if  spelld that wrong) evil.  Recomended for all ages
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Loved this movie. The sound track is awsome. Would have to liked to har more Cher on it but it's still great. My wife loved this as a christmas preasent.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I am in love with this book. Cheers to Mr. Dashner for creating a plot that made me jump in fear, yell out in frustration, and hold my breath for the next twist. I finished It overnight, literally. I began at around seven, and finished at say three in the morning, whoops... Now I'm waking eagerly for the next installment. One of my biggest pet peeves is when an author signs up for too many books, and drags a weak story along way past it's expiration date. Bravo, Dashner, this has become a new obsession of mine.
0307454541|3.0|I listened to this on CD.  I do lots of driving and fill the time by listening to audio books. The reader had an engaging voice and kept the story interesting enough to listen to.  I do not think I could have actually read it.  I didn't dislike enough not to start in on the second book.  I would say iof you have other books that you want to read then start on them first.
B000002U9E|4.0|I am a more casual Kate Bush fan, but I really love most of the songs on this album.  My favorites are \\"Running Up That Hill,\\" \\"The Big Sky,\\" \\"Mother Stands For Comfort,\\" and \\"Under Ice.\\"  My least favorite on the album is \\"Waking The Witch\\"-- I think it's just a little too out there for me.  Maybe it will grow on me.    \\"The Morning Fog\\" has a very upbeat quality that none of the other songs really have and \\"Hello Earth\\" has some great vocal layering going on.      Overall, I find this album outstanding.  Perhaps with more listens I will love it even more!
B000001FS3|1.0|Purchased from 'Medimops'/ Amazon company.  It apperars this is a poor counterfeit copy of the classic U2 disc that I was expecting to purchase - graphics and disc do not match any reference material I have seen for this CD. Buyer beware
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Well, as many reviewers have said, this is a simple release, with no special features. I could care less about commentaries, behind-the-scenes, or any of that stuff, though I do like seeing trailers and deleted scenes. As for the missing scenes, I can't remember exactly what is missing, since it's been so long since I've seen it. For those of you that CANNOT LIVE without that stuff, look away. The movie itself: Wow! The scenery is beautiful, colorful, and it tweaks your imagination. Floating mountains---cool. And instead of being connected to nature, the people are actually connected to the planet. That is a somewhat new and enjoyable twist. Despite what critics say, it was a really great movie. For those that choose to blast the movie because it is a recycled story: waa, waa, waa. So what if the story isn't very original? Robin Hood, Braveheart, and Dances with Wolves were all stories about people who were persecuted for a stupid reason and fought back. It's a story that never gets old; the previous movies mentioned were all great movies, and will be forever. So, keep your boohoos to yourself and enjoy a different approach to a really good storyline. Noone is making you spend money to have this movie. If you didn't like it, review the disc only and spare all the open-minded moviegoers the time. The only reason I reviewed it is because I liked it. Noone wants to read a 5-page review about everything that sucked about it. If you didn't like it, say so and move on. We liked it, and we want to know the quality of the disc and not the movie, otherwise, we wouldn't be looking at it to begin with.
B000001FTA|5.0|\\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" is a ode to Van the Man, not Bruce (that's for Boys are Back).  This album shows that you can listen to one band and, to an unitiated, thinks it is many bands. While a bit mellow, the guitar solos and harmanies are haunting.  As great as other hard rock/metal bands are (Maiden, Priest, AC/DC) all their songs kinda sound alike - Lizzy's songs do not!    The critics who have rated this album a 3 star need to study this album a bit more as it is a complete masterpiece.
0316010669|4.0|I bought numerous copies of this book after reading it, for gifts--for the family member in intel, the family member into everything, the girfriend of Intel....There were so many stories that fed real-life knowing vs data, educated data, and gut-informed data, and how to distinguish them all. I will be looking deeper into numerous researchers discussed, and their informing of real-life settings. Very readable format; I found myself making notes so I could refer back later to name, page, etc.
1423134206|5.0|This is the most gorgeous collection of Disney art that I have seen. Just gorgeous. My only complaint (a minor one) is the paper seems a little thin... but that may be because of the size of the pages - and the book is already quite thick. This is just gorgeous! Probably my most cherished Disney book, and I have A LOT!
0312330537|3.0|While reading 'Shantaram' I thought that it was supposed to be a truthful memoir of Gregory David Roberts' experiences as an exile in India (this belief was encouraged by the bio on the back of the book). As such, I was amazed at the variety and intensity of the events, and the incredible characters. While it may describe incredible things, there is no inherent impossibility that these things might have happened to someone once. However, Wikipedia tells me that the story is largely fictional, so that changes my opinion a lot. As a memoir, it reads as a kind of 'bollywoodisation' of real life, as Roberts elevates the style of prose and description so far into the stratosphere of melodrama that it disappears from view. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what was supposed to be happening in the romantic scenes, they disappeared into a thick jungle of metaphor and never reappeared. But as a tale spun out of a few real events, it makes more sense but is less compelling. It is like a (slightly) more realistic and self-indulgent Wilbur Smith.    'Linbaba' is the nickname given to the protagonist, a convict on the run who stops in Bombay and is enthralled by its complex and exotic life. He gets involved in the local criminal underworld, spends time living in a slum as a doctor, is thrown into a wretched Bombay prison, takes part in an expedition into Afghanistan to deliver weapons to rebels fighting the Russians, and finds the time to have a complicated romance with a mysterious woman. When I write it like that, it is more difficult to see why I thought it was factual. Though I did have my doubts when Linbaba engages in a knifefight with identical twin eunuchs who work for a deranged Russian madam.    This is a very readable book, and the 800 pages or so fly by very quickly. Roberts is a bit addicted to the narrative device of saying 'if I had realised _____ at the time, maybe everything would have been different', but it keeps you wondering what will happen next. There is a great deal of homespun philosophy that is every bit as compelling as you expect the philosophy in what is essentially a romance novel to be. At one point one of the characters proposes that the world is run by one million powerful and wealthy men, ten million men who fight for and protect them, and one hundred million bureaucrats who administer the system. The rest of us just do as we are told. Linbaba, with his desperation, need for affirmation, and rampant narcissism, is a fine picture of why a man becomes one of the 'ten million'.    This review was written in blood, the prison guards viciously beating me every day until I decided to stop writing it. But I never gave up, because I knew that the woman who loved me was waiting to dissolve the lozenge of our hearts in the fire of our passion. I look into her eyes and we tell each other a million stories, dying and rising again through ages of ages. Maybe that is why fate chooses men like me to be her plaything, because if you live like a shadow, you will die alone like a shadow, in the heart of the volcano that is Bombay.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" has always been my favorite Disney movie, and I was so excited when I opened the 2-Disc DVD edition for Christmas.  I popped the DVD in (on my plain, old-fashioned 24\\" tube) and was stunned by how wonderful the restored picture looks!  It looks like brand new and better than ever!  For any fan of the movie, this new DVD restoration is a must have.  Absolutely wonderful.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I have read the sample and it is probably the best book AND movie I have ever read/seen. Five stars!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Loved Band of Brothers.  Wasn't such a fan of the Pacific.  Generation Kill is pretty darn good.  I'm not going to say it's better than Band of Brothers, because it's just not really the same thing.  But if you didn't like the Pacific because there wasn't enough character development, or you thought it spent too much time doing hollywood sex scenes... you'll love Generation Kill.    It follows a group of young Recon Marines in the invasion of Iraq.  You'll get to know and love several of these characters and you'll be forced to experience all of the B-S that they did.  You'll laugh, you'll get pissed, you might even say w-t-f a couple times.  It's a great series.    I was reading One Bullet Away when I bought this series on a whim.  Turns out, it's the same story.  They are great compliments to each other.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I will admit that, until now, I have never read \\"A Christmas Carol\\", but instead - like most Americans - have watched countless film and cartoon versions, from the wonderfully classic 1951 film version with Alstaire Sim and the Mister Magoo cartoon version to the most recent film incarnation starring Jim Carrey.  Having just purchased a Kindle, I decided to take advantage of the free copy offered in the classics section of the Kindle site so I could finally read the actual Dickens tale.  I was certainly not disappointed.<br /><br />I won't bother with a rehash of the story - who doesn't know this tale? - but will only say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend to everyone that they put it on their \\"to read\\" list (it's a rather short story, I was surprised to discover).  As an actor and filmmaker, I was particularly interested in comparing the story to the many film and cartoon versions I referenced above, and this has given me a new appreciation for those versions that were truer to the original, capturing the \\"right mood\\" and maintaining a sense of anticipation, fear, wonder, melancholy, and - ultimately - pure joy.<br /><br />You don't have to relegate your reading of this tale to Christmas time, so I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so.  For those who have read it, it's worth a return visit.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Brad Pitt delivers an insanely hilarious performance.  In fact, everyone in the movie is really, really funny.  Tarantino isn't always my favorite director, but he did a great job with this one.    If you're hoping for a 1978 remake, don't look here.  It's the same story in the most vague sense.  I enjoyed both, but I am partial to the comedic gore in this one.  What is comedic gore?  Well, it's like in Sweeney Todd.  It's over the top so much it's funny.  Eh, You'll see.  Or I should see a psychiatrist lol jk
0316096199|5.0|At age 18, Alice Sebold, an innocent (in every sense of the word) college student was brutally raped while crossing campus one night. She starts her story by recounting the event in graphic detail, and continues the tale in the same frank fashion. Nearly as shocking as the opening chapter are the reactions and actions of certain members of the police force, her family, and fellow students. That she was able to keep a level head, in spite of what she went through, in her attempts to obtain justice is a testament to her mature mental state. Ms. Sebold story, told with frank forthrightness, shines a shockingly bright light on scary situation.  Equally interesting: Even Silence Has an End by Ingrid Betancourt, I Am the Central Park Jogger by Trisha Meili, and The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|I'm kind of into the mockumentary sort of thing.  This is a neat combination of that, but filled with action.  it's too bad hollywood was able to get involved, but it is still really cool.      Politically,  I don't really care what they were trying to say.
B001AUKUS6|5.0|It wasn't an easy conclusion to say \\"Ratts best\\" but I've been listening to them since the late 80z, constantly, and this I feel is probably their most consistent. Its hard to separate their 1st 3 albums. I personally believe it didn't do quite as well as Out of the cellar because of poor singles choices. I feel \\"Got me on the line\\" or \\"You should know by now\\" are far catchier than \\"lay it down\\" or \\"you're in love\\" which were the songs they chose and neither of them hits. I feel they made the same mistake throughout the rest of their career, except for maybe \\"Dance\\". Out of all the bands from this era, and this loose genre, Ratt are my favourites. They just had a knack for writing great hooks, with snappy, crunchy riffs topped off with Stephens piercing (little joke their) & sleazy, grimmy, dirty vocals. Their songs were poppy but still ballsy and the contrasting lead styles of Demartini & Robbin Crosby were great. If you like any of Ratts other stuff & haven't heard this, get it & get the rest of their stuff while you're at it.
0307577589|5.0|I'm already feeling \\"withdrawal symptoms\\" from finishing this book.  I liked it so well.  Great old-school \\"whodunnit\\" story.  I love the way the story was set up, and the characters were all interesting.  I was literally wracking my brain throughout, trying to guess what would happen next and usually coming up dry.<br /><br />For those considering the auiobook, it is a first-rate production.  The reader (same guy who did \\"Dune\\") is excellent.  He gives each character a different, easily identifiable and credible voice.  I really really enjoyed it, and I am definitely missing Stieg Larsson.

0061997811|5.0|This was one of my Christmas gifts, and I spent most of Christmas day reading this book. 'It is full of many cool things. There are little envolopes that have a bunch of stuff from the movies. Harry's acceptance letter to<br />Hogwarts, the Maurader's Map, Dolores Umbridge's educational decrees. You can't understand my delight as I turned each page to find... stuff. Really cool stuff.'''''''''''''''<br />'''''''''''''''''<br />All of the main characters have their own page, giving you information about the actor who plays them, how that actor was chosen for the role and, in cases such as Alastor Moody and Lord Voldemort, how they were transformed into their character. To some people, I can see how this might sound a little boring. It isn't. This book, this awesome book is highly recommended to anybody who is even slightly interested in Harry Potter. Even if you still think that it's boring, get for the things that come with it. Ever wanted to read the Marauder's Map? Here's your chance. And it also has snapshots from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. These pictures show The Room of Requirement before and after Fiendfyre is set to it and The Room of Requirment in it's Dumbledore's Army hideout form. It also has many concept art drawings of pretty much everything. Pretty much every page has concept art drawings of characters, creatures, and structures.<br /><br />Seriously, any fan of Harry Potter would be practically drooling over this book if they had any sense at all. It is highly enjoyable and it points out small details that are in the movies that you never noticed before. It is a seriously awesome book.<br /><br />Austin Readingteen.net
B000N4S8VQ|5.0|I enjoyed it & if you are a David Bowie fan..THIS IS IT!!!You will have a great time watching this entire set of 2 DVD's over & over again. I enjoy musician singers with class & David Bowie is a class act, with class & in a class all by himself.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|I love the show! Only thing with the disc is on Disc 2 episode 7 there's a scratch that gives all my dvd players a hard time. Only Xbox 360 can play it fairly smooth. But when you look at the disc you can't see any visible signs of damage. Otherwise, great show! Very entertaining. Love how they have the backround story of Kate going on on top of each episode's story.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|The mono recordings helped me rediscover Dylan. The recordings sounded very solid and I feel that this is the best way to hear early Dylan music.  I would strongly recommend this box set to everyone.
B002HRTMHQ|4.0|A Hard to describe but likable album,a fusion of pop flavored soul,the singing will have to grow on you,but it has a smoothness to it, a good first effort ,look forward to hearing more from this dude.
0061122416|5.0|While it may sound cliche, I really enjoyed this novel due to the fact that it really enlightened me on the subject of dreams and goals.  You hear all the time from people to pursue your ultimate ambitions, but I honestly can say I've always never had that much persuasive encouragement, let alone enough self-motivation.  However, after reading The Alchemist, it really has encouraged me at least to take a step towards pursuing what I really want to do, and I have and will continue to do this.
B0000025H6|5.0|great price fast ship and recieve. this will be my third copy of the wall<br />hope this one doesn't disapear

0393338959|5.0|Fairly objective if you prefer an economist that considers the sociological factors of income inequality and standards of living in defining economic development. That's what we're supposed to do. If you're looking for finance pretending to be economics, this book is not for you. Good consideration of the results of elitism within our political system, and frequent comparison to similar incidents internationally.<br /><br />However, he's an American, and treats us with kid gloves. The amusing part is my realization that many Americans will think he's far too harsh, but that's what many in our country see when not bothering to gain a broader perspective than what our domestic media provides.<br /><br />This man writes incredible textbooks, and has really brought the crisis to the people in a format they can digest, if they so desire.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Like many I did not find this show until after it came out on DVD. I saw the DVD version for $4 at a garage sale, bought it and loved it. After seeing the Blu-Ray on sale for $25 I jumped at the chance.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The special effects and animation were, without a doubt, very spectacular and pretty to look at in Avatar. For that alone it is worth seeing. But the movie fell a bit flat for me as far as the story-telling. It is kind of ironic that for a 3D movie I want to call it two-dimensional, but I do. Also, digital characters are still cartoons even if they are sophisticated ones. They don't replace real actors and never feel quite real or carry the same emotional weight. So there was a sense of emptiness where that was concerned. (I don't know how else to put it.)    Overall though, it was lovely to watch and good entertainment. It's just maybe not worthy of all the hype it got.
B001G7SS96|1.0|Only two of the three Blue Ray Disk in the package. Returning item. Looks like it was repackaged or something. Little disappointed on it.
0316098337|5.0|This book is what the author chose to write, and write she did. It is a well thought out book. I liked the weaving of the story. To each their own, but this book delivered no more, no less then the story it was intented to write. don't want to give too much away..
B001HOF8AA|5.0|Imelda May's voice is strong, powerful and smokey!  Her music is upbeat, entertaining and has style.  With a mixture of Jump Blues, Swing, Rockabilly and a touch of big band, Imaleda's music is right up my alley.  The musicians in her band sound top-notch and the band is tight.    Imelda's smokey, sultry voice was a breath of fresh air the first time I heard 'Johnny's Got A Boom Boom'.  I wish I could find a female vocalist with this strong a voice for my band!  Imelda May seems to really enjoy the music she sings and the company she keeps on stage and in the studio.        Love Tattoo has a good smattering of styles, all with a touch of vintage to them.  It's a good touch too.  There are some slower songs which Imelda does great credit to and the higher tempo stuff that really gets me going every time they come around on the old iPod!  It's a well produced album that everyone in my family enjoys!     I'm in my early 40's and when my oldest daughter looked at my wish list for gift ideas, her first response was, \\"Oh. I love Imelda May\\"  The rest of my kids know who she is and love her music too/      My only regret was not discovering her earlier.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is definitely a fantastic series. I was impressed at how Season 5 made a solid comeback, especially with the addition of Lumen. I was hoping she would become a new staple in the show, but that appears to not be the case. I did feel like this was more of a continuation of Season 4 since, unlike seasons 1-3 it did not have a reminiscent type ending. I thought Season 4 was quite traumatic and did not expect Season 5 to top it, but they did a great job. I am of course anxious for Season 6 and hope to see Cody and Ester back in the action. Of course with Michael Hall's ongoing sickness and his soon to be divorce with real life Deb, I wonder what the shows future will really be. Definitely get season 5! But it is important to see all the seasons as this is a show that references back frequently to past episodes.

1400052173|2.0|Now the end of the year is here and this book is landing on all the best \\"non-fiction\\" book lists and lots of time is way at the top of said lists.  I can't figure it out, frankly.  The subject matter is incredible, but the writing and research seems to me just so-so.  It's really too bad.  It is hard to follow what is going on as the author skips around from place to place, time to time, and person to person.
0142410314|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory deserves its status as a classic.  Of three classics I recently read to my 4-year-old, all of which he liked, he loved this one the best.  (The others were Pippi Longstocking and Old Yeller.)  I give the book five stars in honor of his opinion, but I would probably give it four stars myself.    Wonka's chocolate factory, like many creatures of Dahl's imagination, is an impossible place, and it is probably only more intriguing and beloved by children for that reason.  Wonka himself is zany and irrepressible, like many a kid who probably shouldn't be diagnosed ADD.  Dahl's characters, with the sole exceptions of Charlie and his parents, are caricatures, something shown well by Quentin Blake's weird illustrations.  (But frankly, I didn't care for the illustrations in this edition.)    Dahl's style has a sort of wild, unruly exuberance, together with dollops of nonsense, that appeals to kids, especially little boys like mine.  Maybe I'm too much of a grown-up now, but it doesn't especially appeal to me, but I very much appreciate how it taps into the spirit of childhood.  Besides, it was pretty fun to read it to my little boy, who clearly was enjoying himself.

031603438X|1.0|Just finished Keith Richard's book Life. If you haven't read it yet, I'd give it a pass. A really long tome with a lot of meandering self-indulgent memories. Not much information about any of the really interesting things that could have been revealed after a life in The Rolling Stones. Goes on and on about his very unexciting childhood and school days, and page after page after page describing a rich junkies life. I actually think all the drugs have permanently put him in a parallel mental universe. His thought processes and sensibilities are definitely on the fringe. (Taking his seven year old son along for a 1970's Rolling Stones tour? Snorting the cremated ashes of his father?) But maybe that's from having a long, famed, indulgent and entitled life. Unlike the Paul McCartney/Barry Miles book: Many Years From Now, there is very little substance about the music or songs or players. Except to complain about Mick Jagger. Probably only three or four lines about Mick Taylor, other than to rub in his lack of success since abruptly leaving the Stones. He writes (or dictates) from the perspective of his huge ego. Which is justifiable I suppose, but do I really want to read his recipe for Bangers and Mash? Come on! Does make me laugh how he loves to portray himself as this fierce gun toting, knife wielding tough guy. Having met him in 1976, I was really surprised by how small he was. Actually how small all the Stones were. The thought of this diminutive, skinny, 5'8\\" (in platforms) waif cruising around looking for argy-bargy cracks me up. In that regard he seems to have a lot in common with Phil Spector, only that wasn't so funny. This book is definitely a ramble, a slog to read, and finishes with little satisfaction. (pun intended!)
B002RWKSII|4.0|Brian and his band did a quite good interpretation of Gershwin music. Some songs arrangements were in accordance to the time Gershwin composed this music. Gershwin definetly was an incredible composer and his brother Ira wrote outstanding lyrics. Brian had help from Paul Mertens in writing the strings arrangements and rest of the guys proved how incredible musicians they are by showing they can play jazz, blues, do wop, bossanova as well as rock and pop. Harmonies are excellent and Brian in studio can still play the tricks. You have to remember this is not the BW from 62-67. To expect him to sing up to other incredible singers who have sung Gershwin music as standards is just expecting too much. But he accomplished the task in the studio version. Live will be a different story. This is a good cd.It is neither a 5 stars nor a one or two stars. Somewhat between 3 and 4 stars. Some of the up tempo music are quite enjoyable as \\"they cann't take that away from me\\", \\"I got rhythem\\", and Nothing but love\\". I love \\"I got a Crush on you\\", \\"Got Plenty of Nothing\\" ans \\"S' Wonderfull. \\"The Like in I Love You\\" is a song for the history and standards \\"Summertime and I Love you Porgy\\" are well done and Brian really put his best to sing beyond his means. The extra song \\"Lets call the whole thing off\\" is quite funny and refresing.In this song Brian really sang quite good. Once again, this is a good cd.
193413712X|5.0|As I was reading \\"Tinkers\\" by Paul Harding, I was initially reminded of Marilynne Robinson's \\"Gilead\\" - a similar sense of old age and dying hovers over both. As I read on, \\"The Bear,\\" the short novel (or long short story) by William Faulkner came to mind - particularly in the descriptions of the woods, with Harding's woods of Maine not unlike the forests of Faulkner's Mississippi. And then it emerged into something all its own, a remarkably well written novel in Harding's own voice.<br /><br />Tinkers is a story about fathers and sons. George Washington Crosby lies in a bed in his living room, attended by family, and he is dying. As he dies, his mind and memory, and so his own life, begin to merge with that of his father, Howard. Howard had been a tinker in rural Maine in the 1920s, traveling by horse-drawn wagon to isolated farms and homesteads to sell everything from hairbrushes and pots to soap and any other tool or product his customers might need.<br /><br />Howard is also an epileptic, prone to grand mal seizures. One day, he does not return home, and George's mother assumes he's died somewhere in the forest he travels through, the natural space of trees, animals and geography that come to seem part of his very soul. Somehow it is fitting that he disappears into what he loves.<br /><br />George has devoted his life to clocks, fixing them, maintaining them, collecting them. Like his father's life was surrounded by nature, George's life is surrounded by time. Eventually, time and nature are going to meet and merge, in death.<br /><br />Harding explores the relationships between fathers and sons. Robinson did the same in \\"Gilead,\\" but she did so through a lens of faith. Faith is overtly absent in the world of Tinkers, and yet it's there, ever so faint but important an echo, in the descriptions of the ponds, trees, fields woods and flowers observed and almost spiritually consumed by Howard, just as George almost spiritually consumed by the ticking of his clocks. The master creator and the master timekeeper is there, if invisible, and Harding acknowledges that presence in how he structures the novel, like a countdown toward George's death.<br /><br />\\"Tinkers\\" received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2009, and it was Harding's first published novel. And it is a fine novel, fully deserving of that recognition. It's also one of the best serious, literary novels I've read. Harding transcends the story of a dying man remembering and hallucinating about his long-gone father, speaking to a yearning we all have for understanding our own fathers, and our sons.er timekeeper is there, if invisible, and Harding acknowledges that presence in how he structures the novel, like a countdown toward George's death.    \\"Tinkers\\" received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2009, and it was Harding's first published novel.

0307454541|5.0|Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist in disgrace. He accused a high profile businessman by the name of Hans-Erik Wennerstrom of a number crimes in his magazine, Millenium, and was unable to produce the proof the charges were based on. Blomkvist was fined a huge amount, sentenced to jail time, and had his reputation torn to shreds. In the midst of his ruin, he is contacted by industrialist Henrik Vanger to solve a 36 year old mystery of the murder of Vanger's great niece, Harriet. She disappeared without a trace and every year on his birthday, he receives a pressed flower like Harriet used to give him. He regards this as the killer taunting him every year. As a cover, Blomkvist will be working on a book compiling the Vanger family history for a year as he digs into the past to solve this mystery. Later in the investigation, he employs the help of Lisbeth Salander, a talented, tattooed computer hacker with antisocial tendencies. She was originally investigating him for Milton Security when Blomkvist discovered her and asked for her help. Together, these two misfits will uncover the truth in this very old crime, but this is only the beginning of the scandals they will reveal to the world.<br /><br />Despite the pages totaling over 600 pages, I read the book in about 2 days. I was so drawn into the world I almost literally could not put it down. The beginning of the book starts pretty slowly, but it doesn't drag along. It's worth reading until it speeds up a bit. The pacing is really one of the novel's strong points. One of my typical complaints of mysteries is after the mystery is solved, the denouement is fairly short and ends quickly. This isn't true with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The ending takes as much time as it needs to resolve, while still leaving enough loose ends for the next book.<br /><br />The strongest part of this book is the clearly written, detailed characters. The two that most stand out are Mikael \\"Kalle\\" Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. Mikael is such an intense journalist and he works focused on the one story until it's completely done. His major goal is to expose seemingly upstanding people as the criminals they really are. He is admirable and fiercely loyal to his friends and family. Lisbeth Salander is the most remarkable character in the book. She is extremely complex with an obviously troubled past with a brilliant mind. Her diminutive size and capacity for violence are an unexpected mix. Her high intelligence and her declaration of incompetence doesn't add up at all and it makes me wonder why the official view of her is so different from reality. The way she strikes back at those that try to victimize her is unlike anything I've ever read before. Up until these two characters meet, each chapter either focuses on Mikael or Lisbeth. I honestly found myself looking forward to Lisbeth's chapters more because she was more unpredictable and engaging.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The Swedish locale and language interested me and made me eager to see more of the landscape. The ending was unexpected and I never saw it coming. There are graphic scenes of violence, torture, murder, and rape, so if this isn't something you like in your literature, I would stay away from it. I highly recommend this novel and can't wait to read the next book.e journalist and he works focused on the one story until it's completely done.

B003VANOFY|4.0|The sound quality on these are fantastic (for music, movies, and pc games).  I have a number of headphones and only my older Sony headphones compete with the quality of sound (but they aren't wireless like these).  The range is great too...I can hear audio coming from my bedroom clearly in the kitchen (about 25-30 feet away).  I don't do a lot of online gaming, so I can't comment on the mic yet.    I use these headphones in my bedroom with my computer, Roku (netflix, amazon on demand, etc), original xbox, and ps2.  Initially I was a bit disappointed that these don't work with my consoles, but then found a way to make them work.  You have to have a computer nearby.  I have my PS2, Roku, and Original XBox hooked into my television...then I connected a stereo RCA to 3.5 cable (Red and White) from my television audio output to my line in plug on my computer/sound card.  I use software (audio repeater or virtual audio cable..VAC) to map my line audio in to my G930's and it works like a champ!  Now I can watch movies and play games in bed without waking my wife.  So this same setup would work if I had my 360 or PS3 hooked up to this television.  The only downside of this method is that it outputs stereo sound rather than 7.1 that the G930's can play.    The battery life is excellent.  I can fully charge them up overnight and they last a good 7-9 hours of play.  I never play more than a couple of hours at a time so one charge lasts several days for me.    The only negatives I have is that the headphones makes a good bit of disruptive noise when you turn your head or adjust them and they are a tad heavy for long gaming sessions...otherwise comfortable.    I would highly recommend these for anyone who plays pc games and/or doesn't mind quality stereo sound coming from their console games without the need for a long headphone wire.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Nina Sayers is an intense ballet dancer intent on attaining perfection. She practices hours a day and doesn't have much of a life outside of her dancing. She lives at home with her overbearing, controlling mother, who is a former ballet dancer, and doesn't have many friends. Her dream is to dance the role of the Swan Queen in the ballet Swan Lake. However, the director of her company thinks she doesn't have what it takes to be both the delicate, fragile White Swan and the seductive, evil Black Swan. She is the embodiment of the White Swan and is technically a very good dancer, but she lacks the passion and ability to let go of her carefully constructed control. The director sees a glimpse of the Black Swan within her, so he casts her in the role. However, he alternates between berating her for her shortcomings and abusing her sexually. In addition, Lily, a new dancer, seems to be perfect for the Black Swan part and seems to be constantly trying to beat Nina in any way possible. Despite their rivalry, Nina is drawn to Lily in an inexplicable way. All of this combined with Nina's quest to get in touch with her dark side are wearing on Nina. She starts to hallucinate and has difficulty discerning fantasy from reality. Can she achieve the level of performance she wants for the lead role while still retaining her sanity or will this role destroy her?    I was afraid I wasn't going to get to see this film in the theater because it wasn't playing in any mainstream theaters and it was slowly leaving the indie ones around LA. It was deservedly nominated for 4 Golden Globes and is now showing at just about every theater. I went to see it with my family on Christmas day because nothing says holiday quite like a psychosexual thriller. My entire family and I were blown away by it. I think the film's success is owed to the characters, the direction, and the music.    The characters in the film are utterly believable and drive the film forward. Natalie Portman bears the bulk of the film on her shoulders, since she's the main character, and does a beautiful job of portraying a ballet dancer in her descent into madness. Nina at the beginning of the film is a little girl living in a grown woman's body. Her mother treats her like a child and she lives in a room fit for a young girl, filled with stuffed animals and pink butterfly wallpaper. She seems to be stunted emotionally with no other friends or family. Her only love and her only life is dancing. This is called into question when the director insists that she is too virginal and innocent to play the lead in Swan Lake. Her fragility and neuroses are uncomfortable to watch. As she tries desperately to impress the director and tries to attain perfection, she starts to mentally break down, but breaks through the childish facade she had been living in. She has to give in to emotion instead of the well practiced control she has. I know from experience that a performer that is technically good, but has no passion or emotion in the performance, is pretty dull to watch or listen to. The destruction of her whole self is needed for her to attain perfection as a dancer in her mind. As she descends into madness, the film gets more and more violent and unpredictable. When she finally dances the coveted role of the Swan Queen in front of an audience, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. The events that go on behind the scenes, real or imagined, give her the perfect state of mind in which to dance either the White or Black Swan roles. Her Black Swan was the opposite of everything that Nina was throughout the rest of the film: predatory, seductive, and almost snakelike. She was almost unrecognizable. At the end of the film, it's almost impossible to tell which events actually happened and which are the product of Nina's fractured mind.    The other characters just add to the film. Vincent Cassel as the director is a kind of hybrid mentor and villain. He pushes her to become a better and greater dancer while using his position of power to abuse her. He simultaneously pushes her forward and breaks her down. I really loved to hate his character. Mila Kunis played Lily, the physical manifestation of the Black Swan. She is the opposite of Lily in almost every way. She is uncontrolled and relies on emotion rather than control in her dancing. The rivalry and friendship between her and Nina is compelling to watch. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother is extremely creepy and takes the stage mother to a new level. The cast as an ensemble worked brilliantly together.    Darren Aronofsky is a great director. I loved both Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain before Black Swan. In this film, he creates a small world inhabited by dancers that seems separate from the rest of the world. The atmosphere is tense and it seems as if someone could lose a part the minute they do or say the wrong thing. There are many things that aren't talked about in the open, but gossiped about quietly amongst the dancers. I loved the use of the handheld cameras and closeups. It gave the film an intimate, claustrophobic feeling as well as enhanced the off-kilter route of Nina's mind. The only part of the film that felt open and spacious was on the stage.    I have enjoyed many of Clint Mansell's film scores, including The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, and Moon, but I think I enjoy Black Swan the most. It features, of course, Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet music and Clint Mansell's unique ambient music with it. His music is largely repetitive and different from usual film scores, opting to use a more modern as opposed to classical approach. I thought the placement of the source music was perfect, as were his additions. The score is really what helped build up the tension in the film for me. I have been listening to the score pretty much nonstop since I saw the film. Here is one of my favorite tracks, Perfection, which is the music that Nina dances to as the Black Swan.    I really enjoyed this film. I like itsfeminist undertones, mainly that it deals with issues that plague primarily women, such as eating disorders, infantilization, objectification, self mutilation, etc. I think, to some extent, the film is about any woman's drive to be the ideal woman that is, for most women, unattainable without surgery. It's a unique, dark, and disturbing film. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
B001NXBRJG|3.0|Fast delivery...Only concern the dvd has paused twice on two different times watching it.. Not for very long so no big deal.
0312600844|1.0|Really - the stories in this novel are just not believable, and so very loosely tied to what's been going on the past ten years.  All the hype about this reflecting our culture just doesn't hold up.    But - the worst aspect is that after 500 pages of misery, Franzen ties a nice neat bow of a happiness -THE END.  Don't waste your time!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I purchased a 3 disc dvd blu-ray combo and received ZERO discs in my order.  The closed packagining was EMPTY.  What a disappointment.  Now I have so much work to do to get my money back.  NEVER order from this verndor or AMAZON, in general.
B001GCUO4S|4.0|If you liked the three \\"Final Destination\\" movies before this one, then you'll like this one, too. It's not really breaking any new ground, but you probably shouldn't really expect that by the 4th installment of a horror series, anyway. If you're looking for elaborate set pieces, dark humor, and a bunch of actors that you sort of recognize from other movies or TV, but don't really want to think too hard about what's going on, then this is the movie for you.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|A good set of headphones that feel comfortable on your head. It's very lightweight, but feel \\"cheap.\\" Nevertheless, I was short on cash, wanted a headset, & read reviews that helped lead me to getting these. I don't have experience evaluating the sound quality, but I have no complaints. Set up is pretty easy once you look over the instructions. I love how you have different controls for CHAT & GAMEPLAY. It mos def makes it very easy to hear others & listen to the surroundings when everyone is muted. These headsets are pretty good for a 1st pair.     My \\"minor\\" issues with these are that they feel cheap & have way too many wires. I, personally, can live with the cheap feel because its what makes them very light & comfortable, but they sometimes feel like they can break easily. Although I positioned/setup the wires as neatly as possible, they just make my setup look messy. I shouldn't be complaining considering it's price.     Overall, these \\"minor\\" issues aren't that bad coming from my optimistic POV. I'm happy with this purchase.    In case you wanted to know:  - I use them on PS3 & my cousin used them on his XBOX360   - I've used them in Black Ops, but haven't tried on MW2  - Used $25 worth of gift certificates on Amazon =)
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great story line - Extremely talented and well played roles - Not just a step away from the Norm...but a HUGE leap!!...You may read the description and think that this would not appeal to you - This series shows what little it could take to make somebody change in an instance - If you watch Season 1 Episode 1 you'll want to see the next one right away!!...if you watch the Season 1 Episode 2 then you'll be hooked (its dark suspense at its best!!!)...normally I write more on reviews but if you have not seen this yet you must get a taste...Amazon offers Episode 1 of all seasons for free to so you have nothing to lose...enjoy your new addiction :)
B002ZG981E|2.0|It took me a while to digest inception. Not because the movie plays tricks on the mind but because I wanted to really think about it.<br /><br />There are some great things about the movie which are mostly the action and the special effects, and then there are some not so great things about the movie and that's what lost it points with me.<br /><br />Inception was an interesting idea but it's poorly executed. The movie feels like a lot of what might make it truly interesting is just missing and filled in with bland subject matter. For instance the movie is about persons who are go into peoples minds through the act of dreaming to steal their ideas and information.<br /><br />Just thinking about the plot reminds me just how little sense the movie makes. Isn't there a better way to get information out of people than this super hypnosis? What makes the movie interesting though is that it all takes place in a dream world where somehow people can connect to one anothers dreams somehow.<br /><br />The weird part is that this high technology just seems like a normal occurrence in their lowtech world. So much so that some persons have trained themselves to fight against such mental attacks by equipping armed personnel in their minds.<br /><br />What this really is.... is the MATRIX recycled. Only this time it's not in a distant future. Just like the matrix this movie is full and I mean full of those \\"what the hell is going on here?\\" moments mixed in with \\"gee this boring\\"... and lastly \\"oh wow! look at that!\\"<br /><br />instead of a World where people are actually sleeping but think everything is real, this is a world where people are awake but we they are pushed into a dream world where they supposed to think everything is real. Replace the Matrix guys in shades with \\"projections\\" and there you have it. Complete with special effects and all.<br /><br />Regardless of what anyone says this is pretty much the same movie recycled.<br /><br />There are too many inconsistencies with this movie to say its 4 or 5 stars just because it looks good. The story is just plain... well... not interesting. I was more interested in knowing how \\"jumping into peoples dreams\\" became a prime too for corporate espionage or just who was the Asian guy? What was his role in the company? How did the others get started into dream diving? (light spoiler)Why can't Leonardo DiCaprio(yes, the actual character names are HORRIBLE!) return home? No one saw him? There were no witnesses and his wife was in a completely different building or other side of the building when it occurred(end). So how did that come in to play as ruining his life? because his wife wrote letters? who cares take it to court and prove it! Just simple things like that seemed to just skip around all the plot holes and no one ever asked questions. Always some simple excuse was given and that was it. That's what the audience is supposed to swallow down.<br /><br />So much of the dreamworld doesn't make sense. If they are jumping into someone else's mind shouldn't they have 100% control. Regardless if they have an architect creating a false world shouldn't it be up to the dreamer to create or destroy what they want? It just doesn't make any sense. They need to go into Fischer's dreams which is a world that he creates to steal secrets and implant idea's? Are they confusing \\"dreaming\\" with \\"hypnosis?\\" Honestly the logic behind the movie barely works and doesn't make the least bit of sense.<br /><br />How about the part of feeling pain in your dream. Isn't that the point of putting people to sleep during operations so they don't feel pain. \\"Pain is in the mind\\" so that overrides physical pain now? your telling me I could poke you with a needle in your sleep but you won't feel it unless your dreaming about it? It's a bunch of bull.<br /><br />I can tell you first hand. When I feel pain in a dream it's because I'm experiencing it in real life. But enough about that plot hole I could go on for days. Lets get to another plot hole. How about \\"the kick\\" and the levels of dreaming which I assume are levels of sleep. First off there's only one level of sleep. If your asleep YOUR ASLEEP!. The rest are stages you experience before your actually asleep. So what's with all the kicks. If you dream your falling off a cliff don't you just wake up? and why would someone elses kick while they are in \\"your\\" dream effect them solely but not you? Your the dreamer shouldn't your world be in 1st person? If your mind isn't there present to experience your dream than why do those \\"projected dreams\\" still exists?<br /><br />If Fischer is unconscious in his dream or he dies why doesn't the dream just fade and send everyone into limbo like it should!  Why is limbo in this dream Cobbs limbo and not Fischer's? And I don't want to hear anyone say \\"oh they were in Cobbs mind\\" I say bull turds! to that! The movie contradicted itself when Cobb or whomever stated \\"they were going to have Fischer tap into his own mind or dream or whatever\\". Then that doesn't make sense when Fishers projections are attacking everyone but for some reason they are in Cobbs world now that I think about it minus another star this movie didn't make any sense at all!<br /><br />Screw this movie. It's an action flick with a poorly written script, a mediocre story (I could care less about Cobbs marital problems), that tries to trip the audience out by confusing them with the dream nonsense. The only thing that's confusing here was the screenplay the directors wrote. This movie was a \\"matrix\\" cash in that came in years later after the matrix series ended. The only thing is as Trippy as the matrix was it actually held my interest because of it's off the wall story that made you think \\"what if this really all was a dream\\"...<br /><br />and there we go again with the reality complex!<br /><br />where inception tries to do the same with its trash ending to confuse you as to what reality is.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line. The Matrix did the dream world better go rent and watch that instead. Pick this movie up if you just want to see the special effects because that's all this movie offers. There certainly isn't a story worth remembering here. The only thing people talk about with this movie is \\"Wow, it looked great!\\" and \\"what the hell happened in this movie?I assume are levels of sleep. First off there's only one level of sleep. If your asleep YOUR ASLEEP!. The rest are stages you experience before your actually asleep. So what's with all the kicks. If you dream your falling off a cliff don't you just wake up? and why would someone elses kick while they are in \\"your\\" dream effect them solely but not you?

Screw this movie. It's an action flick with a poorly written script, a mediocre story (I could care less about Cobbs marital problems), that tries to trip the audience out by confusing them with the dream nonsense. The only thing that's confusing here was the screenplay the directors wrote. This movie was a \\"matrix\\" cash in that came in years later after the matrix series ended. The only thing is as Trippy as the matrix was it actually held my interest because of it's off the wall story that made you think \\"what if this really all was a dream\\"...    and there we go again with the reality complex!     where inception tries to do the same with its trash ending to confuse you as to what reality is.    Here's the bottom line. The Matrix did the dream world better go rent and watch that instead. Pick this movie up if you just want to see thespecial effects because that's all this movie offers. There certainly isn't a story worth remembering here. The only thing people talk about with this movie is \\"Wow, it looked great!\\" and \\"what the hell happened in this movie?
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Shutter Island is one really frightening movie. It isn't a horror film, at least in the modern sense of the term, but a psychological suspense thriller in the style that Alfred Hitchcock always did so well (think \\"Psycho\\" or \\"Gaslight\\"). It is superbly acted by Leonardo DiCaprio (who used to be thought of as another pretty-boy heartthrob, but has developed into one of Hollywood's consistently fine actors), Ben Kingsley (Acabemy Award for \\"Gandhi\\"), Mark Ruffalo and many others, and directed by the brilliant Martin Scorsese. Personally I am shocked that this film has hardly been mentioned at all in pre-Academy Award discussions of the top films and actors of 2010.
B0038AL7M4|5.0|Finally there is a release, by Arrow (UK) on Blu-ray, of this trilogy, which includes one of Fellini's masterworks. I ordered it from Amazon.uk in December 2010 and can confirm that it restores the original soundtrack supervised by Fellini (recorded after filming as all Fellini's soundtracks were), so Terence Stamp's voice speaks his part in English, while the Italian actors speak mostly Italian. There are of course various subtitle options. I can also confirm that this Blu-ray plays fine on North American machines (it is Region ABC, in other words region free), and the picture is all you could hope for from a film of this vintage. By the way the price from Amazon.uk is much lower than the price listed here (Dec. 2010) even if you include the shipping cost.<br /><br />I should also mention that the Arrow release comes with a 60-page booklet which contains the three Poe stories on which the segments are based, plus some valuable critical material. One of the critics maintains that the film should be judged as a whole, since it does seem to have certain thematic links between the segments. There is some validity to this point of view, and the film as a whole does play much better on this Blu-ray release. But i still like Toby Dammit much better than the other two.
B0000025ZK|3.0|well, a month after ordering this product I still have not recieved it so I can't say if it is good or bad. I am starting to get a little upset about not getting it yet
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this mic to work primarily with a Canon camcorder for recording interview-style presentations. As much audio equipment does, it picks up some wireless device noise, particularly if it's close by a phone. Of course, exclusion of such devices from your environment is a regularly necessary precaution.<br /><br />It's impossible to say whether this mic is going to give you exactly what you want. It may pick up too much outside noise for some intentions, not enough for others. Always, you're going to have to experiment with effective pickup until you find the balance you're after for the conditions you're after. I'm not sure I can be as happy as I want to be with the tone or fidelity I'm getting. It isn't bad. It's satisfactory. But given the environmental conditions I'm working in, I have more or less settled on a noise canceling Sennheiser USB headset, which filters out more local noise. You can't even hear a refrigerator in the same room with the Sennheiser, while at the same time, the fidelity is excellent for voice, at close range to the boom.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong. I'm still experimenting with lavaliere arrangements. It can take a while to perfect your implementation. An advantage of the lavaliere is you can place it far enough away that you might not hear as much breathing and mouth articulation noise as the headset and boom picks up.<br /><br />So the jury is still out on this; and the fact is, a lot depends on your conditions and setup. End of story is, nice to have around in case you might be able to accomplish something you couldn't or wouldn't otherwise.<br /><br />One note: If your implementation is local, and potentially powered, I'd look for a lavaliere that doesn't require battery backup. Optional noise canceling modes would also be an important consideration.
B003FNWR6Y|3.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son who is a huge Mario fan. He likes it but was disappointed that one of the pawns was a duplicate and one was missing. If I were buying it as a collector piece, I would have been very disappointed.

B003HARV4S|4.0|A great illusionist movie. Unlike its comparable movie The Prestige, this one has a different twist that you will enjoy. Having a Blu-ray version is a must.
B0041T52S6|4.0|Sit down with your teenager or twenty-something and see if you can find any grounds for enjoying this deliberately asinine spoof of kung fu romance. Ineffably nerdy Scott Pilgrim discovers the 'girl he dreamed about' - justifying his precipitous dumpification of his inappropriately young high-school idolatress - but quickly learns that he needs to defeat all seven of her increasingly bizarre ex-boyfriends in mortal combat. Needless to say, he succeeds.<br /><br />The combat sequences are simulations of popular video games, complete with scores and play-agains. I suspect that there are multiple allusions to specific popular games, but I can't be sure since I've never played a video game in my life. To my mind, gaming has been all downhill since \\"Whack-a-Mole.\\" But it doesn't take a PhD in game theory from the University of Chicago to catch the drift here; Scott Pilgrim is a fantasy surrogate for all the couch-bound thumb athletes of his generation. The curious thing is that my son is no more attracted to gaming than I am; he's a quick-footed second-baseman and an acrobat studying at the National Circus School of Canada. I can't help thinking he set me up to watch this film as a test of my cultural tolerance, especially since he himself fell asleep halfway through it.<br /><br />It's campy and sappy, obviously aspiring to cult status alongside The Rocky Horror Picture Show or Napoleon Dynamite. It's not on a par with those 'masterpieces' but it has moments of originality.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Being of average IQ I had a tough time getting through all the info in Good calories Bad calories. It still helped me form a good foundation of the bio-chem involved in good nutrition.

Following his advise for close to three years now, I can only say I will NEVER go back to eating the way I did in my previous life, my health is just too good!    The writing style of his new book is much easier to follow for the non-scientist with an interest in science, like myself.

B0009P5YXO|1.0|I love the Doctor Who(DW) BBC series and therefore wanted a small piece of memorabilia for posterity. Searching for DW products within the Amazon jungle's extensive vendor database, I stumbled across a TARDIS cookie jar and a 10th generation sonic screwdriver. After serious review of the aforementioned items, I purchased the screwdriver. My decision was mostly influenced by the glowing reviews which I now believe were written by employees (imps) of the diabolical manufacturer. The only realistic parts of the sonic screwdriver were the batteries. The photo shop image of this item is a sham. The actual product is a cheap oversized vaguely familiar replica. The sonic screw driver is so large it can be seen by dreaded Daleks two galaxies away. This product is over priced (not worth more than 13 dollars US tops. The industry can create all kinds of shapes with plastics which are highly malleable. What happened here? I wonder if I can sell my sonic screwdriver at the next Proctologist convention. Buyer beware. -ClolC
B0037KMHRY|3.0|To be honest I have been looking forward to this disk for some time.  As such I might have had this a little over-hyped in my head.    The disk is ok.  Standard movie music.  I was expecting more expressive music, more true to the TRON and Daft meld, but it just wasn't there.  There are one or two songs that are worth it, but the rest is just mashed up hollywood music - something mind numbing and repetitive.    Had I known there were two releases of this - I would have waited, or just figured out what I liked and d/l the single song from Amazon or iTunes.

B002C512TY|5.0|The shipping time was a lot less then what Amazon estimated I'm pleased with that. The primary gun itself was easy to assemble and rather nice to look at. It's a bit awkward to hold but thats not a big issue. The feel of it is a bit less then expected since there was a loose screw in the one I received but that was easily fixed. It also feels a bit thin in some area's. The secondary gun (the pistol) was harder to assemble since the handle was hard to insert. The range of it is rather poor (shoots lighter than the Secret Strike AS-1). As many people have said, the scope is nothing but plastic on the inside, so its good for nothing but show without mod's. The primary gun itself fires rather loudly but that was to be expected (My Longstrike fired really loud too).<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend it to any nerf fans (over age 10). The only thing is, be careful of the price since I got mine at a lower one then any of the currently listed prices (12/26/2010) and its not available at all in stores anymore.
0345505387|5.0|I'd heard mixed reviews about the graphic novel The Exile. I did read through what was offered in the 'look inside' option by Amazon and liked what I saw. In addition to that and having read (and loved) the entire Outlander Series to date, I decided I would go ahead and purchase The Exile. In my head the characters all look one way but my imagination in comparison to The Exile didn't bother me. I liked the artists style and enjoyed seeing the characters how Gabaldon (and the Artist) envision them. No, its not full, detailed, and fleshed out like the original book, as far as text is concerned, it cannot be. However, having the pictures, I think, makes up for quite a bit...besides, having read them I had no trouble recalling events and knowing exactly what was going on in the graphic novel. For a first time reader, I would suggest the book. It'll make more sense that way. But as a fan who's read all of the books... I loved it. I would recommend it. I have already recommended it to family/friends who have also read the books.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|It's a fun gun to play with but as a sniper rifle, it'll always come second best to the Longshot. Range of this gun it a lower then expected due to the reverse-plunger, but its still one of the longer shooting guns and it is the longest gun by nerf currently. The appearance is great and the stock is great as it holds 2 extra clips. One issue it has is that as a sniper rifle, some would like to shoot it from a mounted position, but there isn't a built-in bi-bod. Additionally, the only bottom rail is on the barrel extension which doesn't help its range.    After a quick mod, the range has improved a little. It's still available in stores and is a decent successor for the Longshot, but if you can get your hands on a Longshot, you should, otherwise, the Longstrike is a decent replacement.

1449389627|5.0|By taking some of the great past and present innovations off the divine pedestal they have been put on,<br />Scott Berkun illustrates what innovating is really about in his Myths of Innovation. And although the subject sounds negative, this classic by Scott Berkun is strangely empowering, inspires everyone to be innovative, and does all this in the extremely pleasant, entertaining, and easy to read style we're used to from Berkun. Highly recommended!<br /><br />I always thought that the great innovations in history were mostly about having a great deal of luck and epiphamies, making it demotivating to even try to put my own ideas to work. However, this is one of the first myths that are debunked in the book. By stripping innovations from these inaccurate perfect perceptions, and showing the other forces that drive innovation (hard work, curiosity, motivation, failure, earlier innovations, etc.), this book gives you the exhilerating feeling that it could actually be worthwhile exploring your own ideas. The book also makes your aware of the \\"filters\\" that you put on your own (and others') crazy ideas, encouraging you to open your mind more, and taking away the fear of having ideas in the first place. And without analyzing innovations to death or claiming that there is a magical formula for innovating, you get some handy tips on how to succesfully convert these ideas into real products: creative thinking hacks, motivational techniques, pitching, management, etc.<br /><br />I found the book to be a very interesting and pleasant (even as an eBook on an iPhone) read. It changed my perception about ideas and innovations quite a bit!
B001C08RHA|2.0|Dear Amazon,    You sold me this product stating that it is new. I must say that there is no way that this product is new. I worked with the 2nd largest video/dvd chain and know DVD packaging when it is new. The shrinkwrap is not tight, there are no labels on the video, no security label, nothing. So come on Amazon. You repackaged this and sold it for new huh?    I have to say I am dissapointed and embarrased that we gave it as a gift and it looked used....    Tell me how this happened?    Thank you.
B0048IMZMG|2.0|Taylor Swift had great music previously, but she tries too hard on this album and falls short of anything pleasing to the ear. Some songs sound as if she can't decide whether she is going to sing or talk and the songs just end up sounding awkward.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Larsson's trilogy is one of the best ever written. A friend gave me the first book to read and the day the next two books were available, I had to buy them.

1601251505|3.0|I am fairly new to pen and paper RPGs. My friends and I started playing 4e last year, and about two months ago we decided to migrate to Pathfinder. I was expecting a fairly easy transition or a simple way to learn the game (learning 4e was a breeze). But the book simply made it impossible.<br /><br />While all of us enjoy Pathfinder much more than 4e (simply because there is a lot more depth), the core rulebook is crammed, messy, and not newbie friendly. Paizo either assumes players are coming straight from 3.5 or they tried to fit two books into one. This resulted in a very confusing book.<br /><br />First off, there are about 5 pages on character creating which are composed of definitions of important terms (about 4 lines of definition for each term). After reading the entire book I still did not know how bonus spells work and I also found that some things that should be together (like strength and carrying capacity) are chapters away from each other.<br /><br />Aside from the Core Rulebook, the system is just great! Our encounters go by much faster than they did in 4e. But most importantly, everyone gets the feeling that they have a truly unique character rather than a generic cookie cutter.<br /><br />I would also like to that Paizo has published wonderful supplements, especially the Adventure Paths and the Advanced Player's Guide which are just amazing.<br /><br />I give the game system itself a 5/5 but the core rulebook hardly deserves 3 stars.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|If you are a true Springsteen fan, you must have this box set. Opening the spiral bound book gives you the personal experience of peaking at Bruce's song notes. The Making of Darkness DVD documentary is very well done and had me in tears at the end. Listening to The Promise sent me back to high school, although some of the songs started sounding alike. The DVD concert of the band playing the entire album now was awesome. I haven't even gotten a chance to view the other DVD concerts, and I already think I've gotten my money's worth. Highly recommended.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. What made it special is that the narrator is a 5-year-old boy. His language is unique and his emotional and mental capacity is believable. What made it bearable--the subject matter is truly awful--is the character development. We get to see both Jack and Ma grow and develop as the story progresses. Highly recommended read.
1591391105|2.0|My company gives this book out to new managers. I'm probably going to recommend that they give out something else. I see that \\"The First Time Manager\\" receives good reviews. I'm giving this two stars because I think there's still a few valuable bullet points in this book. There are some good conversation-starters that you can use with your new boss, and at the same time, you can refer your new direct reports to this particular chapter in order to help guide their meetings with you. For example, one valuable reminder was to not run down your checklist with your new boss. A quote from a manager of managers that was relevant was \\"I assume that you are busy and you should come to me to discuss what you are trying to do and how I can help you.\\"<br /><br />Other positives include the highlighting of challenges you will face, such as the need to \\"promote yourself\\" and focus on new situations, its challenges, and the new skills you will need. A key take-away from this was that you should \\"free yourself from day-to-day operations enough to take on strategy and vision\\".<br /><br />However, most of what is here can be boiled down to a 5- or 6-page article (in fact, I've read an abstract of the book and found that to be all that I really needed). Other reviewers have used the word \\"dry\\" to describe the writing here, and I wholeheartedly concur. But it's more than just the writing that is flawed, it's the organization. The reader is constantly challenged with new section headings that, while providing a nice lead-in for the topic, occur so frequently that reading this becomes a disjointed exercise. You cannot easily sit down and digest this information quickly.<br /><br />Another challenge related to the organization of the book was the fact that the author identifies 4 key situations that the new manager could be in, such as a stable team, or a rebuilding effort. For each topic in the book, he outlines how one would react to each situation. However, as a new manager, I really only care right now about the situation that fits mine and I felt forced to read about all at once because the author has interwoven them together rather than separated them.<br /><br />Lastly, I felt that the book seemed to lean towards sales-related management. There were a lot of examples that referred to product lines, which may be a popular topic for managers but there are many who simply deal with production, or support of systems or applications. As an I.S. manager, I didn't find the examples applicable.t the situation that fits mine and I felt forced to read about all at once because the author has interwoven them together rather than separated them.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|I didn't quite know what to think when my friends recommended me to see District 9.  I knew it had something to do with aliens, but not what to expect aside from a few extraterrestrials running around on screen from time to time.  Suffice it to say, I was kind of surprised that unlike a lot of movies, District 9 is not about an invasion.  I was intrigued because it was a totally different kind of sci-fi.      I don't know if it was the documentary style of filming, the obnoxiousness of the main character Wikus, the silly details like forgetting to bring enough armor for everyone, or the unrealistic reactions to the arrival of the aliens, but the first half-hour to 45 minutes of this movie felt a lot like Borat.  And for a sci-fi that feels like a political statement, that isn't a good thing.  For this portion of the movie, Wikus and company wander around District 9 \\"getting signatures\\" on eviction notices so they could legally move the aliens from one slum to another.  I think it was supposed to be funny when Wikus takes an alien slapping the clipboard for a signature, but the senseless violence that starts to occur around them is uncomfortable to watch.  Unfortunately, it keeps on going and going, and we are introduced to a variety of stereotypical groups and characters, and we learn a little more about the reasons why the aliens came here and did, for all intents and purposes, nothing.      Without spoiling too many details of the plot, the second half of the movie takes a totally different turn.  It's slightly better than the first half, if only because Borat/Wikus starts to become a little less obnoxious.  Of course, the plot holes which were very noticeable before, only become more obvious and even less believable.      The movie as a whole suffers from a whole lot of bad acting, unlikable characters, and a general sense of too many filler moments.  The directors, the writers, and the characters seem to have no idea how the aliens got there, or why they're there, and what they're doing.  In essence, they're just aliens to be alien - the rest doesn't really matter.  By the end of the first 15 minutes, when I was still convinced that there was going to be something interesting occurring, I was ready for this movie to be over.  Its a complicated political statement about the treatment of minority groups that could easily be applied to illegal immigrants or Nazis, take your pick.  For really hard-core sci-fi fanatics, this might be watchable, but I have a lot of difficulty figuring out why it gets so many good reviews.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Whenever people talk of the Daredevil Movie they talk of the average comic book action movie they saw in theaters quickly followed by a half witted Ben Affleck joke. The directors cut of Daredevil is a movie I would liken to Equilibrium, a really cool movie that almost nobody knows about. The Directors cut is a vastly superior movie to the average theatrical cut and nearly eight years later Marvel studios has yet to come up with a story that tops the plot of the Daredevil directors cut. most marvel movies concern black and white good guys and bad guys where Daredevil operates in the morally grey area of comic books. in fact if you watch the beginning of the movie you see a hero that is starting to go over the edge and might actually turn into a murderer type vigilante. when Matt Murdock meets Elektra it sets into motion a series of events that not only saves him but actually redeems Daredevil as a hero. so if you never actually have seen the director's cut I implore you to check it out, the story is improved and the action is ratcheted up and you may come away feeling you have seen a really good movie.

0553805371|4.0|I was very interested to learn that the universe may, in fact, exist in 10 or 11 different dimensions and that this situation may present certain problems in the event you can't remember where you parked your car! Seriously though, I am glad that the authors of this delightful little book were not too serious themselves. This is a seriously complex subject but the material is presented in a very light, occasionally humorous way in language suitable for the non-scientist.<br /><br />I waded through[[ASIN:0553109537 A Brief History of Time]] many years ago and I found that I understood the first half of every chapter for the first half or three-quarters of the book and was pretty much lost with the rest. With this book, I was able to come away with a much clearer picture of things. I am not about to advance the latest grand unification theory any time soon but I finished this eminently readable volume with a sense of having grasped quite a lot of what was said. Well done!

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|After having enjoyed Band of Brothers, I was looking forward to gifting my 16 year old son, a history buff, with this sequel series. We watched the first 2 episodes and, thankfully, I checked the rest of the series ahead of my son. This material should be X-rated for the prolonged and graphic scenes of sex and the extreme and unnecessary gore. What happened to the film producers??? This is perverse and polluting. Nothing in common with the appropriate reality (even harsh) of Band of Brothers. I only wish I had thought of checking IMDb before removing the clear plastic cover of the metal box, so I could get my money back.

B00004W221|5.0|Couldn't find this movie in any stores. Priced right, quick ship and movie a family classic.  Would definately order thru Amazon again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow. Great ending, albeit a pretty harrowing trial Katniss has to endure to finally get through the final chapter. There are times when I think that the entire universe is conspiring to literally rob Katniss of everyone she cares about in the world just so that she can be driven crazy, but then denied the release death would bring.<br /><br />This final chapter definitely ratchets up the action and intensity and things are far more worse for Katniss than in the first two books of the series. This intensity serves the story well which ends up being the strongest entry into the series. One could easily see more stories being told in this universe.<br /><br />The story did take some nice twists towards the end of the story I wasn't expecting and it also took a few \\"twists\\" I was expecting. Some of the characters in the book are little more than shadows without much depth and fleshing out some of the ancillary players in the story continues to be a problem for Collins, however, as this is a book targeting young adults it's something I forgive.<br /><br />For those who are considering allowing their children to read, this book - far more than the others - is pretty intense and horrific in places and some children might struggle with what happens to certain characters. The book is not gratuitously violent in it's descriptions of what's happening, nor does it ever contain inappropriate language or sexual content, but what the main character has to endure is pretty rough in places. All in all, I'd recommend the series as an easy read that tells a compelling, interesting and intense story with some pretty great characters overall.

B004E3XD1W|4.0|It took me a while to decide to read this book.  Usually, I avoid young adult books.  But after reading a few reviews for Graceing and came to the conclusion that this was geared more towards older teens, I decided to give it a try.    I really is a great book.  I loved the characterization of Katsa and her journey into adulthood.  Katsa is such a contradiction--young but with worldly responsibilities (killing and 'thugging' for the king)...and yet she lacked self-esteem/confidence, relating with people, and had yet to learn to take control of her own life in some aspects.  Having been raised from the age of 6 to be a killing machine doesn't help with learning to relate with others and build friendships...    SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS    Then she encounters Po.  I love how they connect as friends who enjoy rough-housing--laughing as they try to pummel the other into submission.  This is Katsa's comfort zone.  Slowly, she lets her guard down and realizes that he's become a very close friend...which makes her realization of his true Grace and his perceived betrayal so hard to recover from.  They struggle (pun intended) through and overcome several aspects of their maturing relationship.      The only issue I have with this book is that it doesn't give me a definite ending of forever-happiness.  This is a fantasy genre for crying out loud!  Let me have my fantasy of happily ever after...  Nonetheless, it ends happy...and I feel that with time, their relationship and love could become a forever-love.  Or maybe it already is, but in the novel, there isn't a DTR (Define the Relationship) moment...or actually there is one, and it was incredible.  But it was only the first step in their blossoming love.  I would have hoped for another DTR in which they have a chance to take the relationship to another more satisfying level.  However, in the book there wasn't enough time to establish a new level in their relationship and I wouldn't expect that since it isn't in Katsa's personality at this point in her life.  I am excited for the third book, which is suppose to be set 6 years after Graceling.  I hope to God that there is some conclusion to Katsa and Po.  I believe that with all relationships, Katsa and Po will continue to progress and grow and learn more about love, committed love.  And I believe that Katsa and Po won't give up easily, or at all, because it isn't in their nature...especially Katsa.  She is a fighter, she will fight for their love.  As will Po, but he is less obtuse about it and that is why they are the perfect complement to one another.  Katsa is fierce and aggressive, and she charges forward once she makes a decision.  Po is patient and encouraging, more intuitive.      And about the whole anti-marriage and babies comments that is so prolific in these reviews on Kristen Cashore books...I believe that Cashore has another point of view that differs from traditional fantasy novels.  It doesn't mean I like it, but I respect her opinion.  She seems to be a young author, so I assume that with time, her perspective on these issues may change and grow.  But just like Katsa, the author may only be in the stage where she perceives that freedom in love can only be achieved in open/non-committed relationships (not that they allow cheating and such, but more of an undefined relationship without guarantees).  I don't know...this is just my opinion...and I don't claim to know the author at all.  I just believe that a true storyteller and author writes what they know and what they know the best is the experiences of her life that shape her principles and opinions.    Otherwise, awesome book...and I can't wait to read her second novel Fire.  And I especially can't wait for Bitterblue to come out in April.
0817439390|5.0|I have been interested in photography for many years, but never was able to completely understand the fundamentals of aperture, shutter speed, etc. by reading \\"how to's\\" online.  This book is simple, but doesn't talk down to you.  You could read this book in a few hours and gain more knowledge than you would in hours of reading tips online.  It is clear and simple. Once you learn to shoot in manual mode, you will be amazed how easy it is. Instead of hoping you get lucky with a shot, you will know how to set it up to increase your odds of success.  Definitely recommended.

0316098337|4.0|I was not expecting to like this book but I did.  The story is simple yet thought provoking.  A quick read that stays with you long after you are finished.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This same series was at the large, local stores for a price of around $55.00 and up.  I bought mine for $18 and change.  At first I thought it was a mistake, or that it wasn't the entire fifth season.  This is an incredible value and I highly recommend purchasing. Thanks for the great product/value!
030726999X|4.0|I've just started this book and am, once again, excited.  I was grateful to Stieg Larsson of keeping the stories connected so I'm gently reminded of events from the previous books without too much wasting of time repeating.  It flows naturally and the wonderful characters remain consistent within their created personalities.  This third book keeps the same excitement flowing as his first two have done for me.  With all the complications and extremely involving issues surrounding the story being told, Mr. Larsson keeps me on track and slowly reveals the mystery in his unique and well-crafted style.  A must read trilogy.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|This is a lovely and creative artist, but I cannot make out 80% of her lyrics.  This is one of the best examples of why they still need to teach enunciation in school.  If I could make out her words, I would have given her 5 stars, and bought the CD.    I bumped it up to 4 stars, but my criticisms stand.  Hope someone tells the artist.    Edit:  To show that I did later purchase CD here, and my criticism above are valid even on full quality CD.
B0013FSXSC|3.0|The epic genre was still to all intents dead in 1995, and First Knight didn't do anything to revive it despite what should have been perfect casting with Sean Connery as an ageing King Arthur losing his queen to his new best friend in fable's most enduring romantic triangle. It's not a bad film at all - the action scenes are well handled, the romance better than expected and Jerry Goldsmith provides a fine score - but it's not particularly special, and in taking away the magical elements of the tale (no Merlin here) it's always in danger of veering to the ordinary. It's certainly no Robin and Marion, nor does Connery prove much of a Lion in a Winter with one of his weaker and less committed performances in what's little more than a prominent supporting role despite his top-billing (it was not a particularly happy shoot, and that does show at times). The real hero of the film is Richard Gere's Lancelot, travelling from village to village earning his crust with sword tricks, the actor managing to overcome what seems like his miscasting surprisingly well and showing real flair in the swordplay and action scenes as he initially protects and, naturally, falls in love with Julia Ormond's Guinevere, who seems to respond to almost every dramatic crisis with a slightly nervous smile.     Unlikely director Jerry Zucker (he of Ghost and, er, Airplane!) handles the romance and the action well enough, but he's not exactly got an epic vision, playing much of the picture in medium shot - long shots really aren't his thing unless they're establishing shots - which, allied with the decision to shoot in 1.85:1 rather than 2.35:1, makes for a less than spectacular look to much of the film. The early CGi is variable: Camelot looks good enough but the big night-time battle's computer generated extras draw attention to themselves by their lack of detail even in near total darkness. The look of the film doesn't help, legendary production designer John Box leaving the picture when his setsproved too expensive for the film's budget, and the knights' uniforms (no shining armour here) aren't exactly inspired either, looking like cast-offs from a Star Trek spinoff or a 70s Bond villain's private army.     Yet for all the problems, the picture works fine as entertainment, William Nicholson's screenplay giving the cast some better dialogue to deliver than you might expect and throwing in the odd moment of ingenuity in a couple of the early action sequences. And for all the complaints of departing too much from the myth, it actually goes back to the very first account of Lancelot and Guinevere's love affair, Chretien de Troyes' 12th Century The Knight of the Cart, even keeping the original villain Meleagant (here renamed Malegant and played by a typically bad-tempered Ben Cross) rather than going for the better known Mordred or Morgana le Fay. Not that this is exactly Lancelot du Lac or even Excalibur in terms of ambition - it's a populist popcorn picture, nothing more. As such, it may not be the best vision of Camelot out there, but it's certainly a cut above the likes of Knights of the Round Table.     After a bare-bones DVD release, Sony's BluRay release offers a mild upgrade in picture quality and a few extras that are also available on the remastered DVD special edition - audio commentary by Zucker and producer Hunt Lowry, a second commentary by historian Corey Rushto, four redundant deleted scenes in less than pristine condition and a trio of featurettes.
1401310400|4.0|Ok guys, I enjoyed this book. Now it may have to do with the fact that I LOVE the show Castle and I could totally picture what was happening as I read. And the fact the characters in the book are based on the show characters probably helped a bit...lol But I loved the fact that the in the book there was actually a bit more to the relationship between Heat and Rook than there is between Beckett and Castle on the show. Plus the murder mystery definitely was one that kept me on my toes. you think you have it figured out then, BAM another twist or the person you think did it, ends up dead too. And \\"Roach\\"...Raley and Ochoa are a trip in the book just like their counterparts in the show Ryan and Esposito. So wether you are a fan of the show or not I suggest you pick this up. Its funny, sexy, and mysterious all in one. You will laugh, you will scratch your head, and you will get a bit hot and bothered, but not all at once...lol It's a great, quick and easy 198 page read for sure! As I like to say, take the time to escape reality, this book will most definitely help you do that. I give it a 4 out of 5...i would have loved to have more, but I guess that's what the next book in the series is for right?
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am currently on the 1st level of 30 day shred and so far I really like it. The video switches the moves up and is fast paced so its not boring. I have plenty of workout dvds and for some of them your watching the clock the entire time just so you can give your mind something to do while doing the same move over and over for three or more minutes. On this dvd your focused on switching it up every 30 seconds or so. The time goes by so fast. I have had harder workouts in the same amount of time but as I said before Im still on level 1 so this will probably change. What makes this one of my favorites is Jillian Michaels, I like her tough style and her voice isnt annoying, even though she's chatty, like other workout dvd's. I know on some they are so annoying that I regularly flip them off while doing the movements.
B00275EGX8|3.0|An alright movie but a little boring to me.Some parts were putting me to sleep.I'm glad I didn't go to a cinema to see this sleeper.Something to watch though.

B001H5X7I4|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />When Ben Stiller first approached Robert Downey Jr. about acting in 'Tropic Thunder', Downey was quoted as saying, \\"this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.\\"  Stiller reportedly replied, \\"Yeah, I know--isn't it great?\\"  Somehow, in Stiller's mind, 'stupid' is equated with 'funny'.  Nonetheless, 'Tropic Thunder' was tremendously successful at the box office which I believe had little to do with the puerile script but more with the action sequences and special effects that appealed to the male teenage and young adult audience.  I'm reluctant to concede that Stiller has any talent in the area of screen writing but as a director of action sequences, he probably can hold his own with most of the action sequence directors out there today.<br /><br />'Tropic Thunder' begins with some mildly amusing takeoffs on movie trailers and commercials. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon Jackson) promotes his 'Booty Sweat' energy drink and Stiller as Tugg Speedman in Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown where each sequel seems the same as the other.  Less successful is Jack Black's obnoxious 'The Fatties: Fart 2\\" which consists of Black playing each character in a fat suit and farting continuously. The final trailer, 'Satan's Alley', starring Downey's \\"Kirk Lazarus\\" and Tobey MacGuire feature two monks attempting to repress their sexual longings for one another.  The takeoff is obviously designed to satirize such gay-themed movies as 'Brokeback Mountain'; it's a good way to start a comedy but things begin going downhill almost immediately after the opening sequence.<br /><br />'Thunder' calls for a complete suspension of disbelief as to the plausibility of the plot.  I wondered why Vietnam would ever allow an American film crew to film a movie written in the style of the jingoistic 'Green Berets'.  That's where the film-within-a-film is initially being shot but the locale shifts to Laos (or possibly Myanmar) after the spineless Brit director Damien Cockburn is ordered by studio head Les Grossman to get his actors back in shape after the picture goes way beyond budget in the first week of filming.  At the suggestion of the author the film is based on, Tayback (who is later unmasked as a fake Vietnam veteran), Cockburn sets up cameras in the jungle and is assisted by his pyrotechnics expert, Cody, to create explosions which are designed to bring verisimilitude to the film. The cast is ordered by their newly self-actualized director to take a trek through the jungle with a hastily patched-together script as their guide.<br /><br />I realize that 'Thunder' is not to be taken seriously at all but how do the filmmakers actually capture the footage which is later turned into an Academy Award winning documentary at the film's end?  They would have to have thousands upon thousands of cameras placed in every nook and cranny of the jungle to capture what the actors are doing.  I assume they later used surveillance footage from the Dragons' own cameras when the cast were being held captive in the heroin dealers' lair. But even so, Tayback and Cockburn's idea to create the documentary is too ludicrous for even a silly film such as this.<br /><br />There is little to gain by rehashing Thunder's amateurish plot.  Suffice it to say it involves the kidnapping of Stiller's Speedman character along with Cody and Tayback (Nick Nolte) by a goofy Flaming Dragons gang.  The rest of the cast must earn their mettle by saving their buddies from the gang, despite the fact that all their weapons are mere props.  'Thunder' is supposed to be a satire on action films but by the time Stiller and his gang win their brownie points, you can't tell if this is really a satire or simply a bad action picture.<br /><br />Stiller's main problem is a lack of imagination. For example, he'll come up with the bit about Kirk Lazarus dying his skin black and refusing to break character until we almost reach the film's end. How much can we take of Downeydoing his shtick ad infinitum? The same goes for Stiller's 'Simple Jack'. According to Stiller, 'Jack' is not making fun of mentally handicapped people per se but rather actors like Dustin Hoffman who portray a caricature of an idiot savant in 'Rainman'. Stiller doesn't seem to realize that the idiot 'Simple Jack', is a far cry from Hoffman's brainy eccentric. Some people might find a Goofy Gumby such as 'Simple Jack' to be funny but after about ten minutes, can't we move on to something else? 'Thunder' intentionally is designed to be in bad taste but occasionally the films' scenarists ruin the comic tone by going too far. One such moment is when they actually kill off the director Cockburn; another moment is when Speedman kills a lovable Panda.<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to say that 'Tropic Thunder' is the worst film of 2008 but it comes close. The make-up department however does deserve an award for making Tom Cruise unrecognizable as a sleazy, Hollywood producer.tiller's 'Simple Jack'.

0061997811|5.0|Okay...let me admit something right off the bat.  I am almost 40 years old.  Yes, I have children but they are still too young for Harry Potter.  So this book is MINE!  And it is so, so good.  I feel like such a dork for the sheer excitement I feel reading the book.  I am not finished with it yet but what I have discovered so far is amazing.<br /><br />First of all, when you open the cover, there is a place to sign your name (I wouldn't...as this book has huge collector's item potential) but the point is that it looks like a Hogwarts text book.  For a brief moment, it made me feel school-aged again (which is a good thing!).  Then you open the second page and you are swiftly transported into the world of the Harry Potter movies and, let's face it, it is a magical place to be.  When I got to the page about the Dursleys and saw the Hogwarts envelope, I felt a genuine thrill!  And when I opened the envelope and Harry's letter was actually enclosed, I jumped up and had to show everyone in the house (admittedly, no one cared ;)).  The point is...there are suprises and treasures throughout the entire book....not to mention fascinating tidbits and historical background concerning the making of the movies.<br /><br />I cannot imagine anyone giving this joy of a book less than 5 stars.  But, well, my rating is obvious.  It is one of the coolest things this near-40-year-old has seen in a long time and I cannot wait to continue the journey!<br /><br />If you are a fan, you WILL enjoy this!!  Until next time, solemnly swear to be up to no good...
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I have read every Michael Connelly book and it's always great to know there's another one on the way. He can't write them fast enough for me. The Reversal was great. I love both Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller. It's so much fun having them in the same story. They have two very different personalities and they see the law and justice system through different perspectives due to their professional lives. But they have a great affinity for each other and both have a sense of humor. I hope we see more Haller/Bosch novels. These characters together are perfect for a good story.
0393075966|5.0|The author presents a very readable summary of events. He traces the origins of the crisis back to the thinking of the Reagan and Thatcher era, when Government was the problem and the free market was the solution, which eventually led to the repeal in 1999 of the Glass-Steagall Act. Seeing an opportunity, and knowing they were too big to be allowed to fail, investment banks began making risky investments on mortgages, sometimes holding them, but often packaging them for sale in a way that concealed their true risks.<br /><br />The excessive monetary stimulus following the dot.com bust added fuel to the fire, but the Federal Reserve was reluctant to act to inhibit the ever growing housing bubble. The response to the crisis which eventually emerged resulted in the largest public-to-private transfer of wealth ever seen, as employees, shareholders and bond holders were rescued.<br /><br />One can hope better regulation will prevent a recurrence, but the harmful effects of what has already happened will be felt for years if not decades.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|I ordered what was supposed to be a new copy of a tv series on dvd. However, the box was damaged and all 5 discs had scratches on them. The scratches did not allow us to watch the movie. I got my product very promptly, but didn't know about this issue for 2 months because it was a Christmas present. I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want to take the chance on getting something that is fake but still usable, go for it. But I personally wouldn't use this seller again.
B0025KVLVA|4.0|To this point I've avoided the very early Beatles releases, not because I truly didn't want to listen to them, but because they seemed a bit reliant on covers and typical early 60s rock style and I was more interested in their later work. Past Masters is a collection of all the Beatles singles that didn't make it onto a regular album, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first disc, which covered up through the Help! era. I still preferred the stuff on disc two from when I'm better versed in their work, but there's quite a number of good songs on the whole collection. It doesn't all come together into a cohesive vision as well as their better albums, but there's a lot of enjoyable music here, a nice, pretty eclectic collection of tunes in a wide range of styles.    There's nothing really like their absolute heaviest or must experimental work, these were singles after all. But still, before all the drugs and fame, they were a damned competent pop act, and that definitely shows right from the beginning. It starts off with a song I definitely remember but I'm not sure I mentally attributed to the band, \\"Love Me Do\\". I knew the title was a Beatles song before I heard it, but the down-tempo sound and memorable harmonica hook were a surprise to hear, and it was a nice introduction of the group to their British fans. Some of the most famous Beatles songs ever are sprinkled through here, including \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", and \\"I Feel Fine\\". I don't like all of them the same amount, but they're all pretty hard to dislike at least, and they mix well with the songs I had never heard before. Some of the more interesting ones on the first disc like \\"Long Tall Sally\\" and \\"Slow Down\\" are covers of more soulful artists, but they're able to pull them off without embarrassing themselves. And by the time you get to stuff like \\"I'm Down\\", they're really turning into the true musical geniuses they would become known as.    A few of the tracks on the collection actually do appear on albums, but are still included here because they're different versions, and this becomes more common on disc two, especially when you get to the situation with Let It Be, which had a few singles taken from it before it was shelved and then re-produced before release. Still though, despite the familiar music, there's still a lot to like here. I might like \\"Revolution\\" more than The Beatles' \\"Revolution 1\\", \\"The Inner Light\\" is yet another worthwhile Indian-style experiment from George, and while it's sappy, \\"Hey Jude\\" is one of the group's most famous and sing-alongable tunes. Stuff like \\"Paperback Writer\\" is solidly good, catchy when the band was more focused on other things, and it ends with \\"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\\" is possibly the group's oddest song, sounding like something the members of Monty Python might record, while still somehow feeling like a fitting B-Side for their last ever single. It doesn't amaze as much as their best work, but Past Masters is about 90 minutes of songs that are definitely worth hearing a few times.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|Have yet to see a better American movie this year. Mia Wasikowska somehow held her own against a strong performance by Bening. Wasikowska may have been the best actor in the film. Moore overacted in a few scenes but her character seemed to be written that way. The story didn't seem contrived or overly precious at all. Just a good story well told.
B0026145WK|5.0|Liam Neeson delivers a tight, solid and entertaining action movie in \\"Taken.\\" His lack of empathy for the bad guys, even as weep and whimper upon breaking, is satisfying to watch.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I adored the first movie and loved how Gene Wilder played Willy Wonka.  I wasn't sure at first about Johnny Depp's performance (even though I think JD is a genius), but it kind of grew on me and, eventually, I felt more sad for him than anything else.  Which made Charlie's redeeming of Willy Wonka all the more special in the end.  Charlie ended up with money/a future, but Willy Wonka ended up with affection/a family.  It all balanced out in the end, aka \\"life had never been sweeter.\\"    The special effects are eye-popping and the bright color scheme of the interior of the factory makes the dull colors of the world that Charlie lived in all the more distinctive.  Willy Wonka is decidely odd, a bit spooky, and even a touch cold at times, a much closer representation of the character in the book than the performance by Gene Wilder.  Neither movie comes close to how malicious he can seem in the book as he brings the \\"bad\\" children to their iconic dooms, though this second movie is nearer to the mark.    The background story of Willy Wonka and his father don't add as much to the movie as they should and could possibly have been left out, though there is a sly humor in the idea that the world's greatest chocolatier came from such a strict dentist.  This is not the best of Tim Burton's movies, but I freely admit that my standards where he is concerned are quite high.  The songs were great and the visuals stunning, and the theme of the movie quite family-supportive.        Overall, I would recommend owning both movies and showing the orginal to younger children and saving the later one for older children.

B00436GNVC|2.0|Like other reviewers, I anxiously waited for Duffy's new release.  Her first album was soulful, had an excellent mix of singing styles, and I got a sense that she could be a real force in music as she matures.  It was one of my favorite albums of the year and is still in heavy rotation in my players.  Quite simply, she is a far superior singer to other pop princesses who drip with fake sex appeal (she is clearly attractive but it's just a bonus).  However, this album is a major disappointment.  And at times, it's downright irritating.  As others have mentioned, she is trying too hard to make her voice a \\"brand\\" - trying too hard to make it distinguishable from the crowd.  On several cuts, her voice is so irratating that the screeching feels like nails on a chalkboard.  This sounds vicious I know, but it's true.  Further, the content of the songs is just plain silly; it's as though they were written by and for 15-yr old school girls.  It's not sophisticated and I regret buying this cd.  Duffy, please, I implore you, aim much higher next time. And enough with the Angelina Jolie lookalike poses.
B002JVWRAO|1.0|Supernatural started Season 4 with 3.96 million viewers. Towards the end of the season this dropped to well under three million, and Season 5 bottomed out at 2.28. It's not hard to see what went wrong: the show simply ran too long without its heart, the sometimes strained, sometimes difficult, but always strong relationship between brothers Sam and Dean Winchester. That was what drove the first three seasons, what made Supernatural successful.<br />It's extended absence was what caused Eric Kripke's carefully-constructed mytharc to fail miserably, turning what could have been one of Supernatural's finest moments into its biggest disaster.<br /><br />The sad thing? It didn't have to happen.<br /><br />Season 4: A Brilliant Beginning, a Failed Ending<br /><br />We loved the beginning of Season 4. Dean back from the dead (and that Winchester hug we'd been waiting for); a mythology that was set to give him a fascinating storyline; a brilliant, unique perspective on angels that owed a lot to Misha Collins' portrayal of Castiel. It should have been the best season ever.<br /><br />But here's the thing: just because you've suddenly stumbled upon a new plotline that you like and that your audience likes, you can't abandon all the old story arcs that people have been following for three years.<br />In the middle of Season 4, with the writers deciding to pretend that Sam Winchester and his destiny storyline had magically resolved themselves offscreen so that they could give more time to Castiel and a pointless parade of mythological extras, the trouble began.<br /><br />Kripke & Co didn't just fail the character they created. In pushing one half of the Winchester hunting team to the background and ignoring the need to conclude a storyline that was almost four seasons in the making, they failed fans. And the fans, outraged and tired of waiting for a resolution that was clearly never coming, stopped watching. The highs Supernatural hit when Season 4 started never came back.<br /><br />Season 5: Sam Winchester, the Fall Guy<br /><br />Season 4 marked a difficult year for the Winchester brothers. Each of them was played; angels and demons alike took advantage of them; each of them wound up breaking one of the seals holding Lucifer's cage and contributed, however unwittingly, to his release.<br /><br />The writers, being the balanced people that they are, had more sense than to scapegoat one person for what was so clearly a disaster with a hundred causes. Sure, the boys had issues - who wouldn't? - but they'd both been deceived and lied to, and once they realized that both Ruby and Castiel had been manipulating them, they got their act together, stopped laying blame and settled their differences. You know, like adults. The angel and the demon got their comeuppance, and once Dean discovered that Castiel had helped Sam get to Lilith, he was seriously pissed. Like \\"You do that to my brother and I'll kill you\\" pissed.<br /><br />Oh, sorry, we forgot. That's the kind of thing that could have happened in Season 2, back when they actually tried to give us some closure on plots (while Season 5's priority seems to have been finding ways to put Castiel in Sam's place in the passenger seat of the Impala). What actually happened was that Castiel's betrayal was unknown to Dean and forgotten, or at least overlooked, by Kripke (although we really don't see how it can be so difficult to remember the basic plot points of a story you wrote), while we kept getting reminders of Ruby's villainy and Sam's inherent darkness.<br /><br />And thus what could have been the show's saving grace simply plunged it to lower depths, with falling ratings and irreparable damage done to the characters of Sam and Dean.<br /><br />How Low Can You Go?<br /><br />The stage for the crucifixion of Sam Winchester was set well before Season 5 opened, during Comic Con 2009 when Kripke and Gamble told us he'd be seeking redemption in the upcoming season, and before that when Kripke commented in a TV Guide article that Sam alone broke the world through his selfishness and pride.<br /><br />Really, Kripke?<br /><br />Let's backtrack a bit. Before Sam was born, his mother - yes, his mother - made a deal that led to Sam being fed demon blood when he was six months old. Then she was burnt alive above his crib - not, we might add, by Sam. In the very first episode of Season 1, his girlfriend Jessica, the girl he hoped to marry, was murdered in the same way - still not by Sam, although he was subjected to the somewhat traumatic experience of seeing her burning on the ceiling.<br /><br />Sam then had to leave his college, his friends, his life behind and go hunting with his brother. Along the way he learnt that the demon that had taken his mother had plans for him, his father was killed (not by Sam), he started having visions of people dying, and practically every single person he met who had the same powers he did turned evil. He learnt that his father had told Dean that Sam might have to be put down (and that Dean had been hiding that from him, had lied to him about their father's last words). He was possessed by a demon who forced him to do terrible things. When he let himself get close to a girl after months of mourning Jess, she turned out to be a werewolf.<br /><br />Then, because he was too humane to kill a downed opponent, he was stabbed in the back. He died, and woke up to discover that his brother had sold his soul for him. He swore to save him, but, after months of trying, he had to watch hellhounds rip Dean apart in front of his eyes.<br /><br />We're not experts, but we're guessing that this would be enough to turn anyone into a psychotic serial killer.<br /><br />Sam, however, just kept trying to do the right thing. He listened to Ruby because he thought she would help him save Dean. He used his powers against the angels' wishes because they let him exorcise demons without killing the innocent people they possessed, and to save the world and save his brother. He killed Lilith because he thought killing her would prevent the Apocalypse.<br /><br />We hate to bring this up again, but - selfishness? We've gone through the laundry list of Sam's unfortunate decisions, and we've failed to find even one that he has made from motives of personal gain. You can call Sam an idiot (although even that wouldn't stick, because Dean and Bobby believed that they had to kill Lilith, too - it was just that Sam got to her first), but you can't call him selfish. Or evil.<br /><br />When First You Practice to Deceive<br /><br />Since we've been fairly unrestrained in our comments on loose ends left dangling for the angels' sake, let's take a moment to list them.<br /><br />First, the angels were secretly plotting to bring on the Apocalypse. All of them - including Castiel - did anything that it took to keep up their deception and advance their plans, including sending Sam and Dean on wild goose chases to protect seals that the angels wanted to see broken, frequently and unrepentantly causing casualties and collateral damage. Castiel also deliberately let Sam out of the panic room and sent Anna back to Heaven to give him a clear path to Lilith. And then there was the altered phone call.<br /><br />We'd like to pause here for a moment to think about every point in the past two seasons when someone (often Dean) has blamed Sam for just about everything bad that happened since the day he was born. That could take a while.<br /><br />Now we'd like to think about how often in the past two seasons anyone other than Sam, Lucifer and the non-Castiel angels has been blamed for anything at all. That will take no time at all, because it never happened.<br /><br />Not only did Kripke and his team ignore all guilt except Sam Winchester's, they portrayed Dean as the omniscient saviour to Sam's benighted traitor to the point where it stopped making any kind of logical sense.<br /><br />Sam trusts Ruby despite the fact that she's a demon. Wewould say that this shows broadmindedness, lack of prejudice, and faith in others, all admirable qualities. Still... if you want to call it evil, writers, and turn Sam's ethics and independent spirit into a flaw, we'll go with that. But you at least have to stay within the rules that you made up. If it's unforgiveable for Sam to trust Ruby, even with the extenuating circumstance that he thought she could save his brother, how exactly do you justify Dean trusting Crowley based on a feeling?<br /><br />But let's say we're willing to overlook that. Let's assume for a second that Dean's got psychic abilities that let him look into the mind of a demon and know its intentions (and let's also assume that in his case it's not evil or freakish). That still leaves us with the fact that there were sixty-six seals on Lucifer's cage and Sam broke one.<br /><br />So did Dean.<br /><br />That's an inconvenient fact Kripke and his team seem to have forgotten: we're not denying that Sam made a mistake or that he needs to make up for it. But let's be clear about what mistake he made: he broke one seal, just like Dean did, except that Sam was then blamed for opening Lucifer's cage and everything bad that went with it, while Dean became a true servant of God.<br /><br />We like Dean, we really do, but this is ridiculous. Sam did not break all sixty-six seals himself, and while ignorant and trigger-happy hunters might overlook the difference between breaking the last seal and breaking all the seals, you'd think that Messengers of God (and the people who wrote the story) would know better. Especially Messengers of God who altered phone calls, unlocked doors, and removed other Messengers of God in order to give Sam a clear path to Lilith.<br /><br />And, although we desperately want to give Kripke the benefit of the doubt, because everyone leaves loose ends hanging, we really can't. There's a time when \\"loose ends\\" translates into \\"impossibly botched and retconned story\\", and when they encompass the plot of half a season is that time.<br /><br />Sam Is a Character Too!<br /><br />Dean went to Hell. Dean went to Hell and was tortured for thirty years, which broke his soul. Then he tortured other people for ten years, which broke his soul even more. He came back to a little brother he couldn't recognize and a world that was falling apart. Sam lied to him about his dying wishes, ran off with Ruby, broke the seal, and Dean had to help clean up the disaster that he and his brother had unknowingly helped to start.<br /><br />We get it, Kripke. His life sucked.<br /><br />But, as we may have mentioned a time or two, so did Sam's. Yes, he made a couple of bad decisions, but they were practically forced on him by circumstances that were way beyond his control. He was practically condemned by the very act of being born, and then Heaven and Hell set out to break him in every way they could, so that when the time came he'd do what they wanted.<br /><br />We've always been shown, in detail, the heartbreaking reasons for Dean's unwise choices. Made a deal with the crossroads demon? It was because he loved his brother that much. Broke the first seal? It was because the demons tortured him so much and the thought of it still torments him. Dean is humanized, and we all understand why he did what he did, and there isn't a single one of those decisions that we haven't forgiven him for.<br /><br />But Supernatural has consistently denied Sam the same privilege. In some ways he's had a harder time than Dean, afflicted by a curse because of a deal that was made years before he was born, doing his best to work with that and put his power to good use but having every attempt backfire. We're lucky to have had Jared Padalecki, who took on the challenge, conveyed a range of emotions and showed us the depth of Sam's pain with lines that were frequently just variants of, \\"I'm sorry, Dean.\\" But just imagine how much more he could have done with a well-rounded and well-written part in Season 5.<br /><br />Accountability for Angels<br /><br />We know we've said this already, but we'd really like to say it again. Castiel and his friends upstairs orchestrated the Apocalypse. Sam would never have been able to kill Lilith without Castiel's help.<br /><br />The fact that he jumped ship and joined Team Free Will doesn't make him any less accountable for his actions. If anything, he should be more accountable, because he knew what he was doing all along. When Sam and Dean were trying desperately to prevent seals 2 to 65 from being broken, Cas and his buddies stood idly by and let it happen.<br /><br />So, yes, we get that Sam picked Ruby and it was awful of him and Dean was hurt because he decided that Sam was choosing a demon over him (instead of giving Sam the benefit of the doubt and believing that he was trying to save the world and Dean).  We could make a couple of snarky comments involving the word \\"Gordon\\", but we really don't want to stoop to that.<br /><br />It should be pointed out, however, that whatever mistakes he might have made, at least Sam was not secretly planning to bring on Armageddon.<br /><br />Desperate Writing<br /><br />With Sam and Dean still having serious issues in Season 5 (and, really, writers, was dragging brother-versus-brother out for another season the most original idea you could come up with?), the writers were forced to work around the heart of the show instead of drawing from it. Dealing only with conflict and negativity, the show ran into a dead end, drawing from what it already had. The writers even resorted to killing off characters just to find something to write about.<br /><br />Ellen and Jo, both characters with a lot of promise but who never had much screen time, were killed just when they were beginning to shine. The boys were killed and brought back again. We have to ask at this point: is killing Sam and/or Dean the writers' stock method of resolving a plotline that's run away from them? Because it's getting kind of old. When Sam died on his knees in the mud at Cold Oaks, we were in tears right along with Dean. By the time Dark Side of the Moon rolled around, we just rolled our eyes and wondered who would bring the boys back this time. All Kripke has achieved by overusing the kill-the-boys-to-solve-the-problem approach is to make death mean less in the scheme of things.<br /><br />We won't go into the writers' treatment of Sam again, but we will say that it's just wrong to trash characters just to find something to write about. It didn't work with Sam - it didn't change our opinion of him, it annoyed the hell out of us, and it made Dean look like a jerk.<br /><br />And it didn't work with John. The boys had already come to a mutual understanding that although their father wasn't perfect, he did the best he could. We agreed with them, because it's been pretty clear every time Jeffrey Dean Morgan has featured that for all his faults, John Winchester loves his boys. John was at peace. His sons were at peace. Sam even gave the younger John a speech on loving and forgiving his Dad because he was doing the best he could.<br /><br />So what, precisely, did the show gain by trampling on John Winchester's character to the point where Jeffrey Dean Morgan wouldn't even consider returning?<br /><br />Karma<br /><br />Just in case we've managed to get the wrong idea across, we'll say it outright: we do not hate Dean. We spent four seasons loving Dean and everything about him. So to get us to say Dean was a jerk in Season 5... Kripke's had to work very hard to make that happen.<br /><br />The show's attempt to lay all blame at Sam's door backfired on Dean, and it wasn't because of some silly vessel-related concerns. Sam and Dean are so much more than vessels for archangels, and to suggest that their worth should be measured by how agreeable they are to being taken over is to do them a serious disservice.<br /><br />There are a lot of wonderful qualities that the boys share.They're brave. They help people with no thought of reward. They put their lives on the line for total strangers. And they love each other, absolutely, unconditionally, more than anything else in the world.<br /><br />We're not sure which part of that translates into Dean letting Sam take all the blame for every bad thing that's happened since the day he was born. We don't know how the most loving, concerned big brother in the universe could give Sam merry hell bordering on physical abuse for using his powers, but could react to Jesse's stronger, darker and scarier abilities with, \\"Kid, you're awesome!\\" We have no idea how the things that could have turned Season 5 into Supernatural's highest-rated season ever turned into the endless Dean Winchester pity party that had more than one longtime fan quitting the show.<br /><br />What we do know is that Sam turned into little more than a prop, accepting everyone's criticism and abuse, apologizing for every crime laid at his door whether or not he actually committed it, but it was Dean who came off looking bad.<br /><br />When Dean promised Death that he would let Sam jump into the cage, we weren't upset. It was a hard decision, probably harder for Dean than for anybody else. We understood. What infuriated us was that Dean never bothered to tell Sam about that. He told Bobby, and they had a long discussion about deals, Sam, and darkness, and we're willing to believe that until then Dean didn't tell Sam because he didn't want his brother to feel obligated to do it.<br /><br />But once Dean had accepted that it was Sam's decision, once Sam had made that decision, why didn't Dean tell him then? We wish we could think it was because he was hoping Sam would change his mind at the last minute, but Season 5 precedent has been that Dean doesn't trust Sam to be able to do the right thing.<br /><br />And we hate that. Like we said, we spent four seasons loving Dean. We hated the fact that Season 5 made us have to work so hard not to dislike him. Sam, at least, wasn't pointing fingers, was accepting responsibility and stepping up to do what he could. It made him look like a man who was taking the high road.<br /><br />Epilogue<br /><br />Having said all this... We loved Swan Song. We loved the fact that Dean accepted Sam's decision and supported him although he disagreed. We loved the fact that Dean had faith in Sam and said so. We loved the fact that at the very end, it was Dean's presence and support that helped Sam defeat Lucifer. The season finale of Supernatural belonged to both Sam and Dean, which is exactly the way it should be.<br /><br />So, despite everything, we've left Season 5 with the hope that things are going to get better. It's going to be difficult: it's a rare and extraordinary show that manages to get itself back on track after falling off the grid and seeing dropping ratings for so long. But in its very first season, Supernatural proved that it had the potential to be a rare and extraordinary show. We hope that Season 6 is going to see that potential fulfilled.red other people for ten years, which broke his soul even more.

0316067598|5.0|This is a true story about four American warriors (U.S. Navy Seals)who were involved in a battle in Afghanistan on what has become known as Murphy's mountain.  As I read the details of the battle, I found myself sobbing with tears running down my face.  I fell in love with Marcus, Mikey, Axe, and Danny.  The deaths of Mikey, Axe, and Danny changed the way I observe Veterans Day forever.  I highly recommend this book to both male and female readers. I have read it twice and if there is ever a book to be called a \\"keeper\\" this is it.
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|I know I'm late to the party, but I'll throw in my two cents here.  Kid Rock used to exemplify energy; in this album, he exemplifies ennui.  I bought the album for my wife as a Christmas present, as she loves his earlier albums, but after three listens the best comment she can come up with is \\"it's pleasant\\". I don't know about you, but if the best word to describe his album is \\"pleasant\\", then he really hasn't displayed the spark that made him famous in the beginning. I did enjoy the opening song \\"Born Free\\", in a 70's rock vibe ala Bob Seger, and a tune or two reminded me, as others have mentioned, of Eagles or Creedance Clearwater Revival, but for the most part this disc just doesn't inspire any feelings at all. Maybe it's time to drop the \\"Kid Rock\\" identity and just go by Bob Ritchie for his next endeavor.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this book was one of his best that he has written and i have read them all. I felt more of the mystery then the romance and was constantly on edge. I just wanted to hurry up and find out what happens in the end. the ending is such a shocker I just didn't see it coming, and i love books like that !!!!!! must read it
B002IR3PSC|5.0|This video captures a very good Tull performance; super-good version of early- and mid-seventies classics, which is always a pleasure to see, since the \\"Living with the Past\\" (LWTP) DVD has a mediocre sound and way-too-cheesy video editing for being released after the year 2000. The Live @ Montreux DVD and the AVO Sessions DVD are far better than LWTP. So if you are looking for digital recoding-quality video, and don't care about Ian's voice, I'd recommend those two with emphasis on the latter.  The sound and picture of \\"Jethro Tull: Live at Madison Square Garden 1978\\" are very good for the time it was recorded. Don't expect digital quality because of course this was recorded on analog equipment.  A must have for every Jethro Tull fan.   I'm so looking forward for the official release of the Tampa Stadium 1976 and the London Hippodrome 1977 which share similar video and audio quality than this video who has been circulating before on bootlegging circles for quite a while.
B001HC8516|5.0|After having watched the movie I was dying to get this book to find out more of these ideas.  And as much as I hate to admitt it: but it's so true!  Many men are cowards who would rather be burned at the stake then admitt to your face that they're just not that into you! Even though some example may seem obvious, others stunned me because I'd heard them myself or from friends and was shocked by what some men say and do instead of just saying that they're just not that into you! I was slightly depressed when I finished it but I'm hoping to  learn as much as I can from this book so that I never find myself in another situation where I'm lying to myself about a guy.  A must read book!!!!
B00498YZH8|2.0|Although I enjoyed the nature and subject matter I did not enjoy watching this film. It was long and painful to watch at certain periods. Although I admired the main character, her determination and her grit, there were somethings that were hard to follow. I wish some characters were explained more thoroughly. And family ties... another confusing aspect of this move.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|Christmas present for our 6 year old.  It was #1 on his list.  Got it and it doesn't work.  We have to send it back.
B001TJQMVW|5.0|Little Women is my favorite book, and so I was out to buy a \\"beautiful\\" copy of the masterpiece.  I found this on Amazon and truly thought it was fantastic.  When it arrived, it was just as stunning and there are pictures in the book too.  A collectible for me, for sure!  For some, the Penguin Classics are all they need, but for a favorite, why not splurge and buy the Classic-looking, old-time literature copy?  It's well worth it!
B00314VYNE|5.0|I'm so glad I read all of the reviews on this Jesse Doll before purchasing!  It was so helpful to know that her body was like a Barbie doll's body and that her arms did not bend and that her hat (unless fixed at home) would not stay on her head.  So, when we took her out of the box, there were no surprises and we are not the least bit disapointed.  We will probably fix her hat and string it up, so that it stays on her head.  My daughter loves her and so do we!  Only negative:  the price (now) is 1/2 of the price we paid during pre-Christmas shopping time.  I suggest buying her RIGHT now for this cheap $10 price and hide her away for a birthday or Christmas present next year.
B0007N38LI|5.0|I had originally bought the American version way back in 2005. I caught sight of this version about a year later. Back then, I didn't think much of it, but after seeing that there were hardly any copies about 2 or 3 months ago, I figured \\"what the hell\\", and ask a relative to get it for me for Christmas.    Surprisingly, I first wanted this just for the alternative artwork, but after seeing the two bonus tracks, they became the main reason why I wanted the album.    Just like the original, I loved every song on here. The two bonus tracks are great, and they make up for the flight recording sound not being on (Although if you find the re-released version from 2009, the flight recording is back, along with the original artwork).    Take it from me: if you want this copy, buy the few that are still on here.

I'm rating the packaging--it was shipped in it's box--no outer box or additional bubble wrap or anything else to protect it from the brutish mail service. I really hope it works, because the return period is over. I think the packaging was a little thoughtless and now know to ask how an electronic item will be packed for mailing.     Shipping was lightning fast, however!
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Over the weeks I have been perusing the reviews of this record with great interest.  I finally purchased it toward the end of the run-up to Christmas and have found it to be a unique, fulfilling Christmas album.  As many other reviewers have noted the arrangements are very interesting - even a little exotic at times - with medieval, modern, folk, and orchestral sounds mixed together, often within the same song.  Her song choices are inspiring and, not only the Christmas theme, but the production values and Annie's passionate voice make this a cohesive, linearly coherent piece of work, one far beyond the normal range and intensity for this type of record.  I've even been thinking that much of this material might hold up beyond the season itself.       In sum, this is not only a good solid Christmas album, but a very good record in general on its own terms.
B002ZG9940|4.0|A worthwhile, though not exceptional, movie. This one could have been better with a little more effort. Instead of giving the story more background and depth, the director or producer (or whoever makes these decisions) chose to accentuate the setting and landscape .... which were the highlight of this movie.     The director took full advantage of the quaint European towns, villages, and countryside to give the movie a strong sense of place, and he or she succeeded very nicely. This gave the movie an old Europe mystique that made it much more interesting and engaging than it would have otherwise been due to the relatively thin plot.     Nevertheless, the plot is good enough and proceeds without a hitch, but it is not a high-octane movie. It is the antithesis of the Mission Impossible and Bourne movies.      Summary: An interesting action movie that is definitely worth watching, but not the type of action you might expect, nor as good as it could have been with a little more effort. The setting is the movie's strength and is very well done, and from my standpoint, is worth watching for that alone.

1439133948|2.0|I thought I was the greatest Vorkosigan fan in the world until I read this one. I have to say that it lacks in many directions: wit, action, clear plot lines and believable characters to name just a few.   In order that I could be sure I hadn't missed something,I trudged through the whole book again. In particular, I found the author's ascription of adult-viewpoint thoughts and feelings to a child unsatisfying. If she really can't imagine/ remember what its like to be 11 and abandoned then maybe alternative characters could be developed. Suze was two dimensional and so was Raven. I think the two goons may have been the most believable from the point of view of: what will your characters do when they're stuck between a Roic and a hard place?  Miles had developed in the previous books to a person whose very being was embedded within his family/friends  context and he's frankly not as interesting without his supporting cast (Ivan, Ekaterin, Illyan etc).  Miles seems slightly smaller alone which is a sad contrast to the idea that he was always bigger than his body...  [SPOILER ALERT] Diehard fans all knew that Count Vorkosigan couldn't live forever but I'd have liked to see him again, too.....
B0041T52S6|5.0|When SPVTW came out in theaters this August I was dying to see it but never had the time and when it was to come out on DVD this Nov. I made sure to mark it on my calendar .   So, I ordered it and waited... and waited... and well long story short I think someone stole the DVD, 'cause I checked and it said it was delivered but it never made it to me.     Buuut, I was so pleased that this DVD came with Video On Demand.  I truly enjoyed this movie!  It was what I expected it to be and more. It has everything I would want from a movie.   This flick is sweet, fun, energetic and a bit edgy. It's hilarious and though I'm not a gamer I still got the jokes. I think it was well cast and stupendously acted. It had an array of characters so there's probably one that you'll relate to when watching it. There's also a lot of eye candy. Ramona...foxy!  The music in here was pretty sa-weet, too. It's very busy but in a good way. Like you can watch it repeatedly and catch something you didn't b4.   I can't complain one bit. Also, I'm so pleased that they kept the current ending. I wouldn't have wanted it NE other way.   I think young and old can enjoy it. My mom, whose 47, my sister 15 and I'm 23, we all liked it. Well, I loved.       Edgar Wright, I am now your fan!
031603438X|4.0|Well, Keef, I gotta say I enjoyed yer book immensely old boy!  Not as much as I've enjoyed yer music over the years, but it was a fun gallop.    Just a few missteps.  Who chose that photo for the cover??  Probably not you, but the pic seems to represent only the paranoid and drug-fueled part of yer life, not the fun and crazy ride it's been, like the back cover photo!    Also, things slowed down for me about three-quarters of the way through, when I was getting really tired of the drug chatter and the endless search for yer next fix.  Thank god you got rid of that nasty habit, cuz I honestly couldn't have read about it for much longer.    But thanks for some real insights into yer life and music.  I felt a strange kinship with you!    ~Yer mate.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Thomas Alfredson's \\"Let The Right One In\\" is a sparse, poetic, slim masterpiece of a film which is part Guillermo Del Toro and part Bruno Schulz.  For any fan of horror, the supernatural or experimental film this will be like a juicy orange with a little blood flowing out of the center.<br /><br />Based on John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel [[ASIN:B002BPIWIO Let me In [Let the Right One In] [Hardcover]]] about a 12 year old boy named Oskar (played with an understated melancholy by Kåre Hedebrant) and his newfound \\"girlfriend\\" Eli (in a brilliant performance which makes you wonder how old the actress (Lina Leandersson) herself really is.  The opening shot of the film is a tide of glistening snow, pulsating in a black canopy night, setting the mood of the dark tale which paints a bleak portrait of human nature and the Darwinian world of pre-teen/early teen relations. (Another thing I admired about the movie is how honest it is about this stage of our lives.  People often portray relations between kids as being idyllic.  I don't remember it that way at all. While I don't remember anyone trying to drown me, it's not too far.)<br /><br />Oskar is constantly set upon by bullies and there are shots when the abuse he endures is viewed as Christlike.  The cinematography here is perfect.  His mother (Karin Bergquist) is of no help to the kid and his father is practically absent.<br />He is alone most of the time and his recreational activities consist of sticking knives into trees while pretending he is killing his enemies.<br /><br />Eli appears on the scene in a shot worthy of Bunuel.  Alone in the abandoned courtyard of Oskar's apartment courtyard she is fresh from another kill and looms over the child as either a potential predator or a friend.  Fortunately for the viewer, she chooses the latter.<br /><br />The bond that develops between the two is at first informal, cold, but slowly develops.  There is a child killer loose where Oskar lives and Eli's dubious relationship with him is never discovered by Eli.  After being captured it becomes apparent that the murderer is serving Eli.  The question the film leaves one with is thus: is it Eli's intent that Oskar fill this role?  Is his destiny going to be as ill fated as the killer?  Does she swoop down and save him from a near fatal incident of bullying because they are truly bound or because she needs another servant?<br /><br />Like anyone else I thought it was a bit much using 12 year olds for this kind of role. However, there is nothing here that is all that perverse, except for one single shot which I found absolutely unnecessary and gross.  The reason Alfredson uses kids for the role is not for any nasty reason (if you want an example of that check out some of Larry Clark's movies) but to allow the film a child's imagination.  Reminiscent of George Romero's film [[ASIN:B0004Z33E6 Martin]] this is one of the genius takes on the concept of the vampire.li.

B0017IVG4S|5.0|Bought this item to add on to a 35 year old set. Brio is a great train for my Grandchildren and it makes it much more special that their Daddy and Uncle played with it years ago
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Room is a daunting story based on a real one. Room is based off the Fritz case, in which a man locked his daughter in a dungeon and fathered many children with her.     Narrated by Jack, a five-year-old boy, Room: A Novel tells the story about a woman, his ma, who has been locked up for seven years (since she was nineteen) in a room. Ma has protected Jack well, and all he knows is that he and his Ma live together, there are a lot of things in TV that aren't real like toys and stores, etc., and that every night his ma puts him in Wardrobe to sleep and Old Nick comes. It has been seven years, and Jack is five. As Ma grows more and more distressed, Jack becomes more curious about the world around him and the fake one in the TV (or so he thinks). Ma hatches a plan to escape. At first, the plan does not work, so she comes up with a \\"Plan B\\" which does.     All of the plots I read about the book before I bought it only said how it was a book about a woman and her son locked in a 11x11 room by a strange man, Old Nick. However, I think that the book is more about Jack and Ma getting used to the world after the escape. While Ma, a twenty-six-year-old woman who has been locked up in Hell for seven years, is having trouble adjusting for understandable reasons, Jack has never been out of Room. He doesn't know that he can't have everything in the stores, and he doesn't know that it isn't okay to just hug people you don't know. He doesn't know that rain isn't scary and is just getting used to the idea that there is so, so much out there.     While the author handles the plot in hand beautifully, I do think that there are a few things she could have done better. One is the escape. I learned about the case she based the book off right before I got to the part about the escape. However, the escape makes it so obvious she was basing it off of the Fritz case. Not much of a problem. It would have been fine, it just seemed a bit...too obvious for me. It also was way too sudden. In a matter of two days, Ma comes up with two escape plans, and the second, although it is completely unrealistic and would never work, succeeds. The escape is just too sudden.     Jack's devotion to his mother is touching. Ma is all he has ever known, and like any little kid, he thinks she knows everything. However, unlike any little kid, she is the only other person he as ever met. The author inserted many sweet moments in the book. Maybe bittersweet. My favorite is the end where Jack and Ma, now living in an apartment of their own (resident living, so they have help close at hand at all times) go back to visit Room.     I like second part of the book is the second part where the two are trying to get used to the outside world better than the first part. The first part is interesting, but drags on. Although I love the second part of the story, I do think that the author had trouble sticking to the five-year-old personality. It sounded like a five-year-old kid, but at the same time, it didn't. It didn't sound like a kid who just got out of what Jack got out of. The way Jack thought, the way he adjusted, was somewhat unrealistic.     Overall, Room is a worthwhile novel and I highly recommend it.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This is one of those films that you want to keep stopping, thinking, \\"I'll finish this later...\\" Yet I couldn't. It's a wonderful, horrifying film. I was glad for the occasional \\"dream sequences\\", where Precious imagined herself as a movie star or model. They provided this odd sort of relief -- not comic relief, exactly -- but an ephemeral relief from all the despair. It does end happily, in it's own way, but even then, you don't know what will become of her.<br /><br />The acting is exquisite and perfect and wonderful. This is not a film you want to put on just to \\"watch a movie.\\" Put it on when you are ready for something really, deeply moving and life-changing (don't mean to sound overwrought, but it's true).
1439157383|3.0|First of all, let me tell you that I love the book. It was a great read, kept me interested, and a fitting ending. I loved how Picoult developed the characters. While many books that are narrated by more than one person in first person turn out to be duds or seem like they could have easily been written in third person. However, this book was meant to be written in multiple points of views. I love when the characters think. Picoult has a way of stepping into every single character's shoes. Many of the thoughts of characters are just...the only word I have is \\"perfect\\". Right on the dot.     However, there are a few things I did not like.    1. The whole Julia and Campbell romance. Picoult has a format. If you have read enough of her books, you'll fine the same things - overprotective mom, trial, lawyer subplot. The Campbell and Julia romance was very unrealistic and...just slightly pointless. I mean, you have a high school boyfriend, a serious one. Then, the boy has a seizure, diagnosed with epilepsy, doesn't want to tell the girl so she doesn't need to live with someone who has seizures, so both go their separate ways, many, many years later the girl (woman now) has been moping around about it for all those years. Wow.     2. If you have read this book, there is a part where Anna is just walking along and a hockey team needs someone to play goalie so they can practice shooting goals. Anna is ten then, and has never played hockey and as far as the reader knows, never ice skated. Well, she is so good that she is invited onto the team as a goalie. First of all, that would not happen for two reasons. One, really? Picking up a random little girl to have her play goalie? Why doesn't coach or someone on the team do it? Second, you don't know hockey and apparently, neither does Jodi Picoult. Hockey is a game in which you must know how to skate. You must. Even the kid who is nineteen and has played hockey since age four can't skate well enough. To play hockey, you need to know how to be ice skating without looking down, dribbling a puck, not looking at the puck - it's hard. And a goalie's job is harder. A goalie...even hockey players calls goalies crazy. A goalie needs to move side to side on ice and...it's just illogical. Why did Picoult put in that Anna played hockey? Because Anna is the goalie and she saves...and the book is about how Anna was born to save her sister. It's kind of forced, it seems like.    Well, Anna is invited to a camp for hockey and she cannot go because her mother wants her home in case Kate has an emergency or something. Somewhere in that part, there is a typo. The word \\"staff\\" is spelled \\"stafff\\".     3. The whole trial. Don't  get me wrong. I loved the book, the idea, etc. However, the trial for the kidney...if Anna didn't want to, since she is thirteen she would not have to anyway. Even blood draws in the future, one, seriously Anna? It's a blood draw. You can do it, can't you? And two, she would not be legally obligated to have blood drawn for her sister. The kidney, not that's a major surgery and the loss of an organ. That, I understand, but she wouldn't have to to that anyway. She wouldn't have to do any of it. There was no point in her suing her parents.    Okay, if you read all of that, you probably assume that I hate the book, but even if I cannot convince you this is true, I liked it. It was a good read. I just think it should have been thought through a little more.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read the previous reviews and knew I had to download this e-book right away. I was not disappointed and finished the book within 24 hours. The point of view is genius and the author definitely did her homework within the child development dept. The story could have been a tragic one, but the author chose this point of view, I think, to soften the plot, and make it enjoyable, yet heart-wrenching. I was cheering the whole way for Jack, his mother (who is the same age as me), and their future together. This book changed the way I look at my 3 little boys and I guarantee it will change the way you look at your children too.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This was the first book I bought on my Kindle. I started reading immediately next to an outlet where I was charging it for the first time, and finished it in one sitting.     Thirteen Reasons and Why is phenomenal book in many ways. It's original. I mean, can you name any other book like this? It's quite a page turner. I could not put it down. In fact, I was so entranced in the story that I didn't realize I was reading. I read the whole thing leaning on the kitchen counter next to an electrical outlet! My favorite thing is that the author seems to understand suicide. There are highlight-worthy quotes scattered all over it.     The book has two stories going on at once, and the author handles it beautifully. In the book, a boy listens to a series of tapes - the last work of a girl who committed suicide weeks before. The two stories are one, the girl's tapes which tell a series of stories that lead up to her death, and the story of the boy as he listens to them.     Definitely a must read for teens and adults.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Buy the headset! if you're still thinking about buying them, dont think just buy them you will not regret it. the PX21 headset will blow you mind, Turtle Beach headsets in general are awesome. I got this as an early xmas present for myself (yes for myself) and I dont regret spending the amount I spent. Of course there are a few little bad thing about it but the good thing outweigh the bad things.<br /><br />the good things: The sound is awesome! The first time I connected these babies I nearly got my ears blown off, they just gave me chills all over my body with the loudness yet undistorted sounds of the game. First time I played Black Ops with the PX21's on I could seriously hear the enemy shooting from the other side of the map. The volume control are great, if you cant hear your friends over all of the gun fire, no problem just turn up the chat volume and let the stabilizer do its magic and just like that you can hear your friends talking online. The headset itself is a little heavy when you first put them on but after a while you'll get used to it, they are also very comfortable.<br /><br />the bad things: One thing that I really didnt like was the volume control placement. For me it feels too close to the headset and sometimes it feels heavier than the headset. the control does have a clip so you can clip it to you shirt or something but sometimes that doesnt help because whenever you move your heada bit far it'll pull your headset. Another thing about the volume control is that if you dont clip it, if control bumps into something when you move like when you stretch sometimes it volume knob goes up or goes down. Last thing is the cord is too long (but this is also a good thing) for a person me I only have about 4 feet between me and my bed I dont really use that much of the cord so I just tied the excess cord.<br /><br />But again if you have a big room and you have a lot of space between you and the TV then this wont be a problem for you, you'll have enough cord.<br /><br />Overall, you should buy the Headset, They are the best you'll ever find for the price that they are.uld buy the Headset, They are the best you'll ever find for the price that they are.
1400079144|4.0|What could have been a rehash of the wildly successful DaVinci Code ends up being a fresh story that stands on its own. Of course the main character is familiar but the drama, suspense, and mystery are all brand new.     The only reason this isn't a 5 star book is the underlying apology for the DaVinci Code that seems to unfold towards the end.     Other than that, I look forward to his next novel!
0143116177|5.0|This was a Christmas present, and I assumed by the title it would be thick and ponderous.  Much to the contrary the author takes what might otherwise be a dry subject and pumps life and vitality into it.  He covers the history of currency, stocks, bonds, and insurance from the perspective of the individuals who had a major historical influence in the creation and expansion of these sectors, and in the process weaves a loose history of \\"money markets\\" that reads more like a novel than a tome.  The title might be better as \\"The Wizards and Scallywags Who Shaped the History of Financial Markets\\".  The reseach and detail are extraordinary (at least 40 pages of footnotes), and it is that level of detail which makes the characters come alive. The books real value has been getting a broad historical perspective from which to consider the major world economies and the political/economic decisions being made today around the world.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series; started watching a rental copy at the recommendation of my brother while we were deciding on a good gift for   my niece (she's a history buff). After I saw the first episode, I bought not only a copy for her but also for that brother and then for me! This series gives factual information not only about what really happened when the constitution was drafted; but what was happening in the lives of the new colonials (smallpox vaccines, mastectomies for breast cancer, tar and feathering in the public square, etc.) and follows John Adams, a man of real integrity, as he represents the U.S. in France and the Netherlands and on through his presidency and his sons'.  His life was a refreshing (if not infuriating at times) view into the thoughts and action of a man of uncompromising principle, as well as those of his close friends, Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. It's also just as much a commentary on his brilliant and devoted wife, Abigail, and her intelligent and invaluable input, courage to hold the farm together in his many absences, and much valued friendship with her husband.  I found the characters worth modeling after and the story inspiring. Made me \\"proud to be an 'merican\\".

I am using it with 13\\" MacBook Pro (MC374LL/A) to connect to ViewSonic VX2250WM-LED 22-Inch (21.5-Inch Vis) Widescreen Full HD 1080p LED Monitor.    The adaptor easily plugs in MAC mini display port, detected monitor automatically with all supported resolutions, had no issues with mouse flickering - its smooth as if I am working on laptop screen itself. It is sturdy and no worries of getting plugged out, you need to apply some strength while connecting and removing it (which is good as it will not unplug by itself by minor laptop adjustment)    With dual monitor (ViewSonic and Laptop screen) the transition of mouse from one screen to other is smooth, intuitive and no problems at edges    Before you purchase double check connections of monitor. This is DVI-D single-link and digital-only output with maximum resolution of 1920x1200 at 60 Hz and other end is female DVI-D. If not sure, look for DVI connector pin layout on Wikipedia and make sure it can fit in monitor cable. Or simply ask question to monitor company for right MAC connector.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I hardly could tell it was on.  This Cooler Master Hyper 212 CPU cooler does a nice job on my i7 960, running at a cool 30 - 35 degrees C.  Even though I added a second fan (identical to the one supplied with the cooler) there is no noise and no vibration.  (I recommend using the rubber bushings supplied with the fan.     Since I was not real experienced with the installation of these large cpu coolers, I found it easier to install it BEFORE mounting the motherboard in the case.  Read the instructions carefully.    Size may be an issue for smaller cases.  I use a Cooler Master Storm and it fits just fine, but there is no room to install an additional fan on the side of the case (where mounting holes are provided.)       Once installed, you may have to remove the fan(s)to make room for attaching wires, etc. unless you have extremely acrobatic fingers:) Attaching and detaching the fans is simple due their neat snap-on design.    Finally, I bought a cpu pwr Y chord to join and attach both fans to the CPU fan connector. Even with the extra cost of the Y cable and extra fan, I feel this was a good value.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|So I bought into the hype that number three was to be the best and this was one huge disappointing POS!  Does anyone else find it troubling why all these guys are hung up on this bland skinny H.S. girl?  She certainly is not HOT - she's bland and redundantly the same again and again - she's MEAT to Dine on though a little twiggy.    Pulled this thing out with company on Xmas and it was so boring - way to much sappy dialogue and SPEECHES = Freakin SPEECHES over and over and way to little ACTION.  True Blood blows this thing away and that dang whiny Kirsten Stewart makes ya want to Vomit - like I said a 12 year old must have wrote the script for preteens that don't know QUALITY - Trash Trash Trash!      Don't waste your money on #3 the first movie was great but each sequel has gotten worse.      Also, the ACTING was simply terrible but it matched the infantile dialogue - does anyway actually converse like these idiotics?  NO!      Save your money, rent or wait for it's cable broadcast but I warn you it's a Looooong couple of hours!      This one gets one finger and guess where it is on my Hand! An example that Marketing can sell anything, even a pile of dung such as this!;)
B0015AARJI|5.0|Really like this controller, its just like the one that comes with the game system if you buy it and you can still use the cord to charge it with. Great product with amazons great price. I bought everything for my new PS3 including the PS3 through amazon and the deals i got were amazing totaling a game bundle with 2 games and a controller, an extra controller, 5 awesome games, and an HDMI cable all for about 380. Could not ask for a better price than that!! Amazon is where you need to get this!

I have liked her music in the past and figured I couldn't go wrong, I think I got this for something like 4.99. It has several great songs! The lyrical content is amazing. It makes me wonder what boy she is talking about and I love that! I can relate to several of her lyrics and the tone is comforting. This CD is great for a good solid pop album.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is a must have!! It had a great mystery and suspense in it and it has to be the most underrated movie ever. I fist saw this on broadcast TV called, This TV and after I saw it, I had to get.

I bought this on a lightning deal on black Friday and am so happy I did! I am still trying to watch the blu rays, and then I will go back and watch the extras. There is one with every season of blu rays and it is nicely contained. The CDS will not get scratched and they are safe in this packaging!<br /><br />I won't play the game, in fact they are still sealed, I have only watched the blu rays and flipped through the cool book. I love the feel of the case, it does come in a big black box that keeps the case shown in the photo safe. The design is fun and looks cool out on display!<br /><br />This is a must have for any lost fan!

030726999X|3.0|While I've enjoyed the Millenium series, the translation of all three books is cumbersome and at its most distracting in Hornet's Nest. The first 200 pages are overly detailed and to be honest, boring. Salander is confined for the majority of the book and and inactive heroine leads to an inactive narrative. There are some plot twists that kick start the story, but then it all just kind of stumbles to a conclusion. Some storylines seem to be left hanging for the other 6 books in the series that died with the author. By far the weakest of the trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" does provide closure, but still feels empty.
1591841666|4.0|Seth Godin argues for the case that you need to lose something to gain something else. So quit on this that you aren't really passionate about, or things that aren't too hard to attain. Dive into things that consume you - that make you want to give everything. Be numero uno or don't waste time! Quit early when you know it's a dead end or if it isn't worth your attention so that you can give your undivided attention to things that matter. I love this quote from the book: 'It's Almost Impossible to Overinvest in Becoming the Market Leader.' 3 Questions to ask yourself before quitting: 1. Am I Panicking? 2. Who am I trying to Influence? 3. What sort of measurable progress am I making? If you're trying to  influence a person or a company, you're limiting yourself - if you're trying a market instead - the possibilities are endless! And always make progress while waiting for things to happen - status quo makes expectations hard to meet because customer will grow in their expectations.
0446195529|1.0|I have read every one of Baldacci's books (and loved them) but this one was a dud.  As other reviewers pointed out, the first 300 pages were boring and went nowhere.  The end moved to a brisk climax.  The plot was utterly bogged down when it didn't meander.  I think this was his worst book.  I'm glad I got it at the library insead of wasting money on it.
B0047VSW30|5.0|I rented this movie because my wife likes period pieces where everybody wears costumes.<br />Well, to my surprise, I REALLY LIKED \\"AGORA\\"!!<br />The sets were GREAT, the acting was SUPER, and I wasn't at all bored!<br />Battle scenes were (for the most part) not too bloody, with a cast of thousands.<br />Most torture was cut before things got discusting. (I don't care, but my wife does).<br />The story was VERY INTERESTING and we all got a GOOD HISTORY LESSON, too!<br />Rachel W. should get an award for for her AMAZING performance.<br />Did I say that I liked this film? Of course! And so will you!

015603008X|5.0|Flowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes<br /><br /> Often, a book is called \\"classic\\" merely if it's old. This is an extreme misnomer; the very day this book came out (in the 60s) it was a classic. It is not the date it is published that makes it a classic, but a certain quality: timelessness. This book was excellent on the day it was published, and it will still be excellent a hundred years from now. Of course, the terminology will have changed some (e.g. they use the words \\"retard\\" and \\"moron\\" in a very specific sense that is rarely, if ever, used anymore), but that won't matter in the least. Because this book is not about a mentally handicapped man who receives an intelligence enhancing surgery; it's about the human condition and how it remains no matter the circumstances.<br /><br /> Charlie has an IQ of 68. A score of 70 is the cut-off for \\"normalcy\\", meaning he is medically considered to be mentally handicapped. But he has an obsession for getting smarter; he even goes so far as learning to read and write (his spelling is atrocious, though readable). Imagine his delight when he's approached for an experimental surgery that should increase his intelligence to well over 130 (the minimum to be considered a genius). He keeps a personal diary, though which his story is told.<br /><br /> This book is just crazy amazing. Even though it's extremely sad, it's just so fascinating that it doesn't even matter. It works on so many levels: on the surface it's an interesting little story; a little deeper, it's a fascinating look at how insecure everyone is; a little deeper than that, it's a study about loneliness; and at a deeper level still, it makes you wonder whether it's worth it to be smarter and have your delusions shattered (Charlie even comments about how in certain ways, he was much better off before the experiment).<br /><br /> To make a long story short, this book should be required reading for life; anyone who hasn't read it shouldn't be allowed to think of themselves as an informed adult.<br /><br />Memorable Quotes:<br /><br /> Even a feeble-minded man wants to be like other men. A child may not know how to feed itself, or what to eat, yet it knows hunger.<br /><br /> They had pretended to be geniuses. But they were just ordinary men working blindly, pretending to be able to bring light into the darkness. Why is it that everyone lies? No one I know is what he appears to be.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please see my profile.Memorable Quotes:     Even a feeble-minded man wants to be like other men.

031603438X|5.0|This book was a gift to my husband for Christmas.  He is reading it now and gives it a thumbs-up.  He's always enjoyed the Rolling Stones and says this book is great.  I plan to read it when he's finished.  It has great pictures and from the sounds of it, some pretty funny and interesting tales of Keith's life.  I purchased this at a bargain price, new, from Amazon.
B003YLK2RI|4.0|The performance was great, the editing fantastic, the mixing top notch, and this is by far the best representation of Slipknot live since Disasterpieces.  The features are strong and the backstage stuff is ... well, if you got the stomach for Clown's style of film making then you'll like it, otherwise you'll be bored and get little out of it.    So why bother reviewing this?  To say what I couldn't find others say: this isn't anamorphic widescreen (black bars at top and bottom of screen) and the audio is only 192 kbps.  What does this mean?  It means the audio and video quality is less than it could be, it means it won't look that good on widescreen TVs and it means that - never mind not releasing a Blu-ray for perfect quality - the DVD is subar by current standards.    Would that stop me from buying it again or should that stop you from looking at it?  No.  But when I bought it I thought \\"who cares if it's not on Blu-ray, it'll still be the best sounding and best looking DVD they could have ever made and that will supersede all else.\\"  Wrong, and disappointing.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|The Opteka X-Grip is made of light weight synthetic plastic like material.  However, the strength and comfort exceeds my expectations.  I prefer carrying the X-Grip rather than a heavier tripod.      I look for a large object to rest the unit on for capturing pictures or video which require sturdy settings.  Further, I recommend using a quick release product to attach and detach your camera fast from the X-Grip.  I prefer the quick release product, such as, the Manfrotto 323 RC2 Rapid Connect Adapter.  However, you may screw your camera on.
0891419063|5.0|When I was in Mobile recently, I visited the city museum and saw a photograph of a young marine in his dress uniform.  That marine was Eugene Sledge.  I was curious why his picture was in the museum and learned from the staff that his book, \\"With the Old Breed\\", was Dr. Sledge's account of several Pacific battles he participated in during WWII.<br /><br />I bought the book and must agree that it is probably one of the best personal histories of the Pacific war ever written.  War is cruel and grotesque and Dr. Sledge lets the reader know just what it was like.  His book should be required reading for all Americans.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|That's me in the cattle auction scene, wearing my black, Vietnam cap, & the old, brown Hillbilly hat in the bar scene. Other than that, Sundance doesn't hand-out their top awards to just any film! This movie tells it like it is! If you're looking for disgusting language, you won't find it! If you're looking for blood & guts...you won't find it! If you're looking for nudity or steamy sex scenes...you won't find it! If you're looking for a well-writen, true-to-life depiction of a young girl's struggle to save her family, that's \\"Winter's Bone.\\" This film is done with taste, complimented by excellent writing, directing, & acting skills.
0446567337|1.0|I have never understood the attraction to Nicholas Sparks novels. They are corny, boring, and the love story is always on the completely impossible side. Forgive me for being a cynic, but I find it highly unrealistic that people can fall in love after a mere two weeks, which is what happened to the two main characters, John and Savannah. When John, being a member of the United States Army, is deployed, the relationship between the two is strained. So what makes this story so interesting? Absolutely nothing. I mean it- the characters aren't interesting, the story is unoriginal, and the actual writing is truly atrocious. I've seen sixth graders write better stories than Mr. Sparks. This may sound ruthless, but it still is highly disconcerting that the man has managed to make a living out of writing love stories that mean nothing and speak only to preteens who are waiting for their own happy endings. Reading this is like eating a piece of chocolate cake; it seems satisfying at the time, but in the end, the only thing it brings is regret.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I am the biggest Grey's Anatomy fan, for two reasons, one I love the medical/life lessons feeling to it, and two because of the twist, turns and clifhangers at the end of every episode and season. Season 1 to me was kind of slow, basically I beleive because the writer wanted to give us the knowledge neccessary to understand some medical terminology. Season 1 for that reason was slow, but do not let that define your interest in GA, once you get to Season 2 you will not be dissapointed, and you will better understand the stories and the surprisess. So I gave this season 5 stars because like I explain is like a Medical book, yet for a great series it was the ground where everything was build. So get it, you will not be dissapointed at all.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|[[ASIN:B002C6A6N6 Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series]] I love this show. It came beautifully packaged. The DVDs look and show real good!

They need to specify that in the advertising.

B0040YFR1Y|4.0|The Movie is excellent, love seeing Robert Rodriquez breath new life into the franchise.  Adrien Brody does a really good job as the main character and I'm hoping there will be at least a couple of other movies made in the future.<br /><br />BD-Live, it really sucks and this release is no exception.  It locks up my player, I RMA'd the first disk and the second disk does the same, I have an Oppo which is an outstanding player and it locks up the movie when ever you try to play it.  BD-Live \\"could\\" be useful but instead of having quality content they choose to have worthless content and ads, not to mention most of your lock ups are caused by this badly implemented \\"fluff\\".  Do yourself a favor, go into your players setup and disable BD-Live.<br /><br />I would have rated this disk a 5 but took one star off for BD-Live locking up the player.  Yes I have tried this disk on other Blu ray players and it locks them up also.

A good thing to do is to salvage any parts you can from the front gun because it is pathetic and wrong to call it a side arm.  Use the spring and barrel from the front gun  and store them away for future use.  This is a great gun and is used by beginners and pros alike.  This is the most bang for your buck.now the long srikes counter part the long STRIKE has one major flaw it's firing system is that of a recon it uses a plunger system the perfect example of the watering down of these guns. The long shot is a great gun to mod given the fact that no parts are glued down in the main gun and the firing mechanism allows you to add more springs.  Probabaly the best additional spring is the BBB the Big Bad Bow spring gives it great range at no cost damage wise to the gun.  Thanks for reading and if I were you I would keep one Long shot in the box just in case  Gotyournose  out
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This was probably the biggest hyped thing Bruce has ever released since Born To Run, and Tracks,  It lives up to the hype.  The boxset starts with a essay about The Darkness album, and it is worth reading.  Then you get a lyric booklet with probably one of the best covers never used for A Springsteen Album; Him standing in front of a 70's model car out in the desert, below stormy clouds.  Then you are submerged in his 77-78 notebook, even down to his handwriting, and doodles.  The Darkness remastered CD follows next, and it was remastered to restore the warm inviting sound the album had.  Then you get The Promise: The Outtake CD, which includes, Talk to me, Because the night,Save my love, and Fire.  You get two performance DVDs; one from 1978, and the other from 2009, with footage from 1970's practice video on the other side.  You finally get The making of Darkness on the edge of Town.  A well done documentary, and dedicated to Danny Federicci at the end.  All in All, it's Worth the price you pay.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan is one of the most intriguing films to come out of 2010.  Natalie Portman plays the ballerina Nina Sayers, the vexing main character who is overly obsessed with perfectionism and landing the lead in a revamped version of \\"Swan Lake.\\" The film is enthralling and thrilling to watch because of the dramatically intense expressions, dialogue, and sensuality displayed by each character within each particular scene.  And there is also the relentless images throughout the film that will make viewers cringe as they see Nina gripping and peeling away what appears to be a struggle between imagination and reality.<br /><br />Indeed, it is the coupling of Nina's ballerina nemesis Lily (Mila Kunis), a somewhat rock and roller type of character who adds a bit of the hard-edge elements to the film and ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) who attempt to dispense the freedom that is lacking in Nina's ballet routine as well as to unleash her inexperience and insecurities so that she could play the part of the Black Swan.  But in the process, it is her own personal dilemmas, immaturity, and overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey) who appears much more as a coach rather than a nurturing figure that suggests origins of where Nina's stagnant personal and professional growth may derive from.  And as the film progresses, Nina grapples with expectations that eventually collide with her perfectionism.<br /><br />Director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler) and screenplay writers Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz are attributed to providing the artistry and intensity to the character of Nina.  What appears to be a typical storyline of an over ambitious dancer hungry to the play the lead part of the White and Black Swan within the first 30 minutes of the film, transforms to a downward spiral of hallucinogenic and psychological proportions within the last hour that are highly thought-provoking and shows Nina shockingly unraveling to deterioration right before the viewers' eyes; the climax of the film is deserving of an Academy Award nomination for Portman.<br /><br />Overall, Black Swan is a film filled with unpredictable twists and turns.  And one does not have to enjoy or have an interest of the ballet in order to understand the storyline that speaks for itself because of the artistic and dramatic contributions of the characters.  It is a film worth watching.eyes; the climax of the film is deserving of an Academy Award nomination for Portman.    Overall, Black Swan is a film filled with unpredictable twists and turns.

030726999X|4.0|I've read the first and the last of this trilogy and readers should be warned not to start the books on a weekday night because they won't get much sleep. Larsson is brilliant in the way he moves the story around, keeping several threads going - a master of suspense. As far as I know he only wrote a few science-fiction stories before creating these blockbusters. This was going to be his retirement income and if he had not tragically died at 50 he would today have many millions in the bank. I am especially interested in journalism, so to see all the ins and outs of a major investigation, to be part of a crusading magazine, and see how crucial the Internet can be to gathering information was fascinating. It is expertly done. There is also the struggle with a corrupt section of the Swedish secret service as well as seeing a bit on how Swedes live. Do they really drink that much coffee?  The books deserve the highest praise. So why four stars? It is after you end this exciting ride that your critical faculty goes into gear and you have some caveats. That there would be such murderous efforts made by government officials to keep our heroine in psychiatric prison doesn't make sense. She was 12 years old when she attempted to kill her father and I can't see how, if she had been simply assigned to a foster home, she could have caused any damage to national security. The murderous sex pervert in the first book is simply too extreme to be believable, especially considering who he was  .(A semi-spoiler follows) Near the end of the first book our heroine, raised in a totally dysfunctional home and essentially an orphan since 12, not to mention the extreme psychiatric-sanctioned abuse she undergoes at this time, who as an adult dresses like a Goth with a ring in her nose, and fraternizes with bikers, suddenly is able to transform herself and perfectly impersonate an aristocratic English heiress with a perfect Oxford accent and fluent German. She is good enough to fool several bank directors which enables her to steal more than $100 million dollars from the accounts of a major corporate crook. Then, with one little phone call she also gets him killed. This may happen in\\"virtual reality\\" but not in the real world. Still, if you want to get away from it all and enter another world there are no better pills than these books. A final caution: there are some ugly, ugly episodes involving murders and sex perversion. Hey, Larsson wanted to write best sellers. He had spent his life as a poor idealist, fighting against racism, Nazism  and the abuse of women.

B0024RIMBG|5.0|With a wonderful blending of harmonic singing, beautiful gowns, and talented women set against the backdrop of an ancient Irish castle,  Celtic Woman has scored big with a video that is both pleasing to the ear and to the eye.       The 23 selections range from tradional Irish music like 'Danny Boy' and their stirring version of 'Mo Chile Mear' to classics like 'Over the Rainbow' and to contemporary like 'You Raise Me Up'.  My favorite is 'Spanish Lady' in which all five voicalists (Chloe, Orla, Hayley, Lisa, and Meav) and Mairead the super energic vilolinist/dancer participate.        Also included are: 'The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun', 'The Prayer', 'Caledonia', 'Newgrange', 'Dulaman', 'The Blessing', 'Scarborough Fair', 'Granuaile's Dance', 'Beyond the Sea', 'At the Ceili', 'Lascia Ch'io Piange', 'Carrickfergus', 'Sing Out', 'Panis Angelicus', 'Last Rose of Summer', 'Shenandoah', 'The Voice', 'Somewhere'.
B00319ECGU|3.0|The collection was priced well and appeared on the website to be packaged well.  I purchased 2 copies, 1 for my father for Christmas and 1 to keep.  My only issue with the collections was that the case of my copy was damaged and the blu rays were just loose inside.  I regret not buying it in a store where I could have heard the discs bouncing around inside.  This is the first time I have had this issue with Amazon after probably 10-15 purchases of multi-disc collections.
B001EN71CW|5.0|In my opinion, the Firefly/Serenity series is one of the best sci-fi series to date. It has a 'soap opera' feel, where you are anxious to see the next episode.  It is a great travesty that this series was canceled after only one season.  The action and situations keep you entertained the entire time. The blue ray menus on the product are excellent and they include a lot of special features. A great product that I fully recommend and wish there were more of.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I watched \\"The Sound of Music\\" numerous times in theatres when it was first out. Then eventually got a copy on VHS, then DVD when that came. It just wasn't the same though. Until now. This Blu-ray version is remastered from a restored copy of the film. And it looks splendid. Sharp images with clean colors. It looks great on my 52\\" screen. There are only a couple places where a slight color shift is noticed within a scene. It was a pleasure to watch the film again. The package also contains the remastered film on DVD and a number of extras. The interactive BD extras are good, although after you make me click my way through several selections, I would like to be rewarded with more than 2 photos, as is the case in some places. I know there is no shortage of photos of the production. Likewise, having to click through a selection tree to watch a short clip is cumbersome. I would like to be able to see all those clips as one video (given that they appear to have been produced a long time ago, they were probably part of a longer video to start with. A Blu-ray disc has room to spare so why not give me both options?<br /><br />This is a must buy if you ever liked \\"The Sound of Music\\"

0439023513|2.0|I thought the concept for The Hunger Games was a good one that should and obviously did set it apart from the rest of the books of young adult fiction. The thought that someone could come up with the actual game was intriguing if not questionable, and I thought it would make for a great dramatic story. This being said, I enjoyed the first two books and have recommended them to a lot of people.<br /><br />However, I would not recommend these books to parents. My mother and many mothers I know are sensitive to child abuse, fictional or not, and when I told her about the premise--with teeth gritted--she said she had zero interest in reading it. This would especially ring true for \\"Mockingjay.\\"<br /><br />While it had great, quick pacing, this story was brutal. It scares me to think that these books are being called \\"the next big thing,\\" after \\"Twilight.\\" I don't think these books are really meant for kids, quite honestly, or at least this one of the series isn't. Without giving away any specifics, this book is just completely unforgiving to its main characters. At points it seems like Collins might have been rushed or that she simply didn't truly care for the characters by the sheer numbers of characters that die in the pages. While \\"Harry Potter\\" played the cruel card a few times, Rowling made sure that Harry would ultimately triumph as the underdog should. That feeling was no where to be found in \\"Mockingjay\\"--the ending, however happy it should have come across, left me feeling as though my soul had been crushed. I was not satisfied with this ending, although I wasn't so blinded that I didn't expect it as a possibility. The fact the characters are unable to make choices or decide things for themselves (even though the world is pitted against them) is unsettling and unfair and just makes the book unnecessarily painful.<br /><br />Though perhaps this is how the book was meant to be read, as it is largely about war ripping apart a country. Still, especially considering this is a book meant for high school-aged readers, I think it ought to have made an attempt at having a happier feel in the very end. These characters are dragged through so much that they deserve some peace and the readers some peace of mind for them.<br /><br />I will give it credit for being so bold and for standing apart from the plethora of vampire novels out there. The first two I would continue to recommend, however I wish the end had gone some other way or that I'd just not bought it or come to own it, let alone read it.for high school-aged readers, I think it ought to have made an attempt at having a happier feel in the very end.

0007234376|5.0|This would be a good starting place for someone unfamiliar with Christie's works. It is one of the Hercule Poirot detective stories; I hadn't read any of them before and therefore can say that it doesn't seem to have a negative effect reading this one out of sequence. (It did make me want to read more of the series though!)     The story is set in a small English village where gossip is the favored pasttime and nothing much of significance ever really happens; however, the village inhabitants are stunned when two mysteries unfold at once: one involving blackmail and a suicide, and the other involving murder. Hercule Poirot, who has just moved to the village to retire, is irresistibly pulled into the intrigue and starts to investigate. He is aided by the village doctor, Dr. Sheppard, who narrates the tale.     It's been a long time since I was completely absorbed in a mystery, and this delivered that deliciously maddening desire to have to know- right now-- who done it? It's difficult to put it down once started, and the ending was nothing short of nail-biting shock. Christie is a master at keeping the reader guessing and then delivering an emotionally stunning wrap-up of her tale. This one kept me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to read more of her novels.
030746363X|5.0|I've read hundreds of articles, studies, and books on diet, weight management, supplements, weight training, etc.    This is by far the most impressive and entertaining book on how to hack the human body.    Additionally, Tim references the \\"Colorado Experiment\\", which I've tested personally about 10 years ago. It worked with flying colors... 30+ lbs muscle gains in 60 days.    I found protocols for \\"ice age\\" experiments amusing and interesting as well... even a little inspiring..    As far as the \\"2-3 star people\\" referencing \\"not enough examples\\", I'm sure the problem lays more in the fact that Tim can't do EVERYTHING for them. This is a BOOK, not a video. However, his demo photos, resources, etc are very effective in clarifying anything not overly obvious    GREAT book... and even more so when you consider we just buy thing for a measly $15!

B0000844M8|5.0|An old family favourite,The DVD arrived well within the stipulated time frame and was in perfect condition. Highly Recommended and I'll be back
B0043EV774|3.0|It didn't take long to see that this movie is meant for kids and is generally a family flick. I only got it because my brother told me that \\"the 3D is as good as Avatar\\"! I will be beating him soon!<br /><br />The 3D is pretty good but a few quick parts were a bit jarring to the eyes because an object was a bit too close to the screen forcing you to get cross-eyed. If you want good 3D this movie will get you there, most of the time, but you should remember that this movie is meant for kids so dont expect anything special.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|Power is a perfect blend of complex prog rock melodies and rhythms, without the schlocky psychedelic or folksy antics. Thanks to the introduction of guitarist extraordinaire Steve Morse into the Kansas mix we get one of the most inspiring hard rock records of the 1980s: power! Unfortunately this \\"classy rock\\" act could not be sustained. The follow up in 1988 fell through the cracks of the cracking music industry (when Bobbie Brown, Millie Vanilli, and Motley Crüe dominated  the charts). Power is a unique gift to the history of Rock. Check out Steve Morse with Deep Purple, though.
B0000669JL|3.0|[[ASIN:B0000669JL Legend - The Best Of Bob Marley And The Wailers (New Packaging)]] I was very disappointed in the condition of the plastic folder (cracked) and the CD was scratched in 3 places,,also had a small smear of some kind on the music side which I was able to get off.  It took about 8 weeks to receive.  Will never order again from this vender. Not exactly sure where it came from but had foreign writting on the mailer.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Kubrick was a genius of cinema, a master of telling stories with pictures so loaded with meaning that often no dialogue was needed. Nowhere in his canon is that more apparent than in Barry Lyndon. Almost every single shot here looks like an Old Master painting, perfectly composed, a joy for the eyes. Once you let your need for quick narrative movement go by, Barry Lyndon wraps you in its sumptuous embrace and doesn't let up for three hours.<br /><br />Three hours?! Yes, and there are a few bits where it grinds a bit, but if you're just enjoying the scenery and open to Kubrick's very sly visual wit, this is an episodic treasure. I'm pretty sure Thackery would have loved this version of his novel, though his take on the life of real-life rogue Andrew Stoney is somewhat more openly satirical than Barry Lyndon. Yet there are many very funny if rather quiet bits of humor here. My favorite is the opening of the second part; read the intro and then watch how Kubrick follows it visually. A classic joke, no doubt.<br /><br />The main thing to remember here is that this is a picaresque film, in the best of ways, and that means long character revelation is the thing. Ryan O'Neal is good, though I might have liked a bit more overt humor from him. But no doubt that was his director's call, as SK's stamp is on every little nuance of this film. All the acting is solid and never detracts from the procession of beauty, while some performances, especially Leon Vitali as the hilariously pouty Lord Bullingdon, are exceedingly excellent. Kubrick knew how to get the best from his actors; few directors are master of so many aspects of filmmaking.<br /><br />This film is for those who like their stories shown more than told, and the third person narrator, as opposed to Thackery's typically Picaresque unreliable first person narration, sets up the scenes quite nicely, and then Kubrick's insanely crisp visual sense takes over. I'm not sure England has ever looked better on film, nor will it.<br /><br />Which is why this merely acceptable dvd print is rather a travesty; if ever a film needed a perfect transfer to blu-ray, Barry Lyndon is it. This dvd version has obvious compression in some pastoral shots; I don't want my waving grass pixilating, thanks! The dvd has zero extras, excepting a trailer, and I really wouldn't mind a bare-bones BD either, if it looked as perfect as this film should. PLEASE give this work of art the respectful treatment it deserves, and issue it in full splendor in hi-def, m'lords.<br /><br />Kubrick made almost a dozen masterpieces, and this is certainly one of them. For sheer sumptuous eye candy, it may be top of the tree.erely acceptable dvd print is rather a travesty; if ever a film needed a perfect transfer to blu-ray, Barry Lyndon is it.

B00377V6J2|5.0|Alberg King is truly a King of the Blues.  Stevie Ray Vaughan is one of the greatest blues guitarists of all time.  Togerher, these two put on a great performance.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I just got this in the mail today and since it was beautiful outside, I took it to the course. The range finder routinely picks up the flag from 200 yards. I had a little trouble finding the flag from further away mainly because I couldn't hold it steady. The battery is starting to go bad already because my screen is dimming, I went to walmart and couldn't find the type of battery it needed anywhere. I am still very satisfied with the V2 rangefinder and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a valuable advantage.
B000JIHP88|5.0|FP Rainforest Mobile is a hit with our grandson.  He is eight weeks old and follows the animals as the turn and is soothed by the soft music.  Strongly encourage everyone to purchase this as you won't be disappointed.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|This is an actors movie...it's character driven which I love....but Tarintino doesn't fudge history a little bit...He punches it in the face...but because he features Jews as almost superhero like as the good guys there wasn't a larger outcry that someone completely rewrote history...The truth and the sadness of WWII is lost in this film...the violence isn't what is highlighted though...It's the tension..make no mistake Tarintino is a master filmmaker and his ear for dialouge is unmatched by anyone out there...Yet the fact the esseance of what the war was is not caputed in this film at all...Jews were cowering for there lives and made to do some pretty horrible and digrading things in WWII...so not surprsing someone made a Jewish revenge film...But if you want to really know what the war was like and ...this ain't the movie for you
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great, even if not 3D.  The added materials on deleted scenes and the process of making the film was really interesting.  They left out some interesting scenes, not crucial to the movie, but if left in would have put more context to movie.  Great stuff.
B000U5GJO6|5.0|Miles Davis and Gil Evans created a beautiful, romantic, sound in this album that can take you away from the everyday hectic pace of life to a wonderful place. This album was included in \\"1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die\\" for good reason.  It is perfect.
B0046JLTCE|5.0|Excellent! If you (like I did before buying this) are thinking \\"Why should I bother to buy this if I already have the songs?\\", THINK TWICE! This version of the album \\"The Way of the Fist\\" is amazing! The calendar, the poster, the cards, DVD and CDs. Everything is more than I begged for. If you are a fan of the band or if you just started listening to their music, this is a bundle your SHOULD NOT MISS. You won't regret your purchase!
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|so unbelievable that a young girl who is molested and frightened shows no signs of it until years later.  Even her boyfriend/best friend doesn't notice anything.  He then agrees to help her commit suicide?  I was very disappointed and will never read another novel by Jodi Picoult.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|My gift from my sister-in-law for Christmas, I love my sister-in-law! I have seen Clapton live a couple of times have never seen Winwood live. I have never seen Clapton play like this, just something to behold. Winwood is still a prodigy! Awesome DVD if you have any appreciation for music in our lifetime.
B000003CM8|5.0|I love the CD.  It works great.  I bought the LP back in the day, but it has become scratched up.  It's nice to listen to the music without the scratchy noise.  Brings back the good memories.
030746363X|4.0|What everyone seems NOT to understand is this is all from Tim Farris's point of view. He is just making things that he has done and has found successful, accessible. He never claimed any of this as a miracle cure. People have become so accustomed to being lazy, that all they try to look for is a quick fix. REALITY, you want to be healthy and lose weight you need to put the effort and time into it. Common sense. You read it and take the advice and alter it to fit your personal needs. Every person is different. Again he is just sharing what worked for HIM. He never claims its easy. So stop bitching and complaining.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|Spoilers herein!    The primordial notion behind it is rebirth, but rebirth not only in the actual reincarnated physical sense, as is ultimately consummated, but also rebirth in the sense of being reintegrated with the breast; the notion of incest is absolutely pulsating throughout the entire film, and the metamorphosis of characters experienced throughout the sexual encounters is brutally direct in this sense. It would seem that the dream-like state one is immersed in after death is what allows the maximal realization of this basic instinctive drive, since it would be a state in which all repression is lifted, and desire can be experienced in its purest, most raw form without the nay-saying psychic censor beeping like crazy. This is clearly too threatening for a conscious \\"normal\\" person to face up to in their everyday experience, thus dreams and reality are distorted to conform to our particular compromise formations, allowing us to live day-to-day without being overburdened by the anxiety of facing our sexual urges head-on.    In its analytic scope, the Oedipal ties are clearly laid out as unresolved; the little boy experiences the death of his parents with detachment, the death of the rival (his father) and of his love object (his mother) occurring simultaneously, a kind of reverse deus ex machina operating in a perverse way, the rival is killed but in a way that destroys the princess they were fighting over. The impotence he experiences (double meaning) carries its weight retroactively in the notion that his mother tells him that she loves Oscar and his father, but in \\"very different ways\\", the Lacanian notion of \\"the name of the father\\" rearing its ugly head, the mother loves something the son can never provide to her (the phallus), thus the sexualized love cannot be realized. But in a moment of utmost mirroring of the father figure, Oscar enters the body of the father and sees himself through his eyes, watching his mother contort during sex and seeing \\"littleOscar\\" at the door, watching his parents.    As the mother figure died, Oscar must appeal to the next best thing in line, the mother's daughter... And the pact to remain faithful to his sister creates a sublimated metaspace that permits the diluted enactment of his desire to be engulfed and reattached to the primordial breast, at least as a promise. Linda apparently shares in some kind of dynamic of her own, as she kisses her brother in a sensuous way, she herself living her own Elektra symbolism through Oscar. Anyway, as Oscar enters the head of Alex, the rule-free realm of the symbolic permits him to experience his fantasy of incest with his sister, turned mother (in a flash), turned sister... The morbid desire for fulfillment compels him to enter for a brief period into the aborted fetus his sister produced, even the split and murdered off component of his sister representing a possibly desired destiny. Truly the \\"come inside me\\" line almost in itself justifies choosing English as the primary language for this film, and the encapsulated space of his sister's uterus creates the holding environment for the engulfment to occur... attached at last; the most poignant moment is when the baby is still attached to his sister (or is it his mother?) by the umbilical cord and is brought to the nipple, which is the only element seen clearly (this was a very smart move, from all standpoints, as a baby's eyesight is 20/400 at birth). This moment brings to a close the consummation of Oscar's fantasy, and thus is reborn in a literal sense as well as through purposeful incestuous regression. The unity engendered and its inherent hope are fractured with the cutting of the cord, at which moment the baby immediately starts crying and is taken away, the promise of eternal bondage destroyed thus again, entering the void of an existence deprived of any enduring physical contact, regardless of how many times one reincarnates, even when one enacts their most basic forbidden wishes. On amore controversial note, perhaps Linda experienced the feeling of completeness in herself as well; her desire to possess the phallus of her brother/father becoming alive in a bizarre way. As a female entity she became whole by producing a phallus (satisfying the dispelled notion of \\"[...]envy\\"), and with a mind-twisting denouement she not only possesses but produces the familial phallus she so longed for, finding peace at last.

0671024256|5.0|I bought this book on the advice of a published writer friend.  I am beginning the process of researching and writing my first piece that I hope to publish.  This book is absoulutely fantastic. First of all, it's a great book for just pleasure reading about Stephen King and how he developed.  Second, it's an inspiring book for a first time writer like myself.  I have been highlighting and bending back pages all day and expect this to be a one-day read.  I just can't put it down.  Thanks to Stephen King, I have the inspiration and confidence to get started...and that's half the battle won!!!!!!
1848566190|5.0|I ordered this book for my dad at Christmas because I saw an article for it in BoxOffice Magazine. My dad, like myself, is a huge movie buff and he is a fan of the sagas and trilogies. He also loves art and history. This book combines all three of his interests with the beautiful work of Mr. Struzan and commentary on his work! With it's beautiful illustrations, it's a  great coffee table book and will definitely get a conversation started! Highly recommended!!!
0684833395|4.0|I read the good soldier Svejk which, apparently, inspired this book. Catch-22 was certainly more modern in its references and it covered things from multiple viewpoints. Catch-22 was more slapstick comedy whereas in Hasek's classic you were never sure if Svejk was a genius or an idiot with his simple minded torpidity and senseless compliancy. At the end of the good soldier I leaned towards Svejk being a genius underminer and from reading Heller's book, he too probably thought this. It's almost as if Hasek's protagonist, Svejk, was reincarnated into catch-22's hero Orr.   My own favorite characters in Catch-22 were Milo who's ludicrous economic machinations were sheer brilliance and the despotic old Italian man who's ruminations on life were genuine.     The plot did bounce around a bit too much for my liking, and the time shifted without warning. Hilarity and riot were mixed sad and poignant scenes such as in which Snowden's murmurs morbidly about being cold while being cradled in Yassarian's arms, sheltered by comforts of \\"There, there.\\"   In all a good book, especially after tumbling past the first 200 pages or so.
1607886480|4.0|You can't go wrong with a Michael Connelly book.  The Reversal revisits attorney Mickey Haller and creates a great mystery-thriller that will be sure to keep you up late at night.  I almost cheated and went to pick up the book instead of the audio version because I wanted to read it faster than the narrator could speak.  Connelly really nails Los Angeles and the star witness is a spectacular character.  This is a story that will keep you guessing and wanting more.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I saw this movie on Netflix and decided to buy it for my mom for Christmas because she never got to see it in theaters. We both love it and I have already caught her watching it over and over. If you love babies, you will love this movie. It is really cute and entertaining. The babies are funny!
B000056Q81|4.0|I've been listening to \\"The Vogue Years\\" over and over for the last couple weeks, one of the many times I've returned to this collection for the solace it provides--for the soothing vocals and ballads of Ms. Hardy, as well as the superlative instrumentation that accompanies her, in a range of styles that includes doo wop, folk, reggae, a subdued \\"go-go\\", and early 60's girl group (&agrave; la the Spector Sound).  There are even 1950's-style background vocals on several cuts.  That being said, this music is also timeless--I can picture Ms. Hardy as a medieval troubadour on some of the simpler, downsized numbers.  The blessing and the curse of this collection is that Ms. Hardy is never anything but mellow--if you prefer raucous, look elsewhere--because by today's standards, this set could often qualify as \\"Lite FM\\".  The songs included in these 2 CDs lean towards the meditative via their reflections on love and life.  I could list my favorites, but there are so many that I'll keep that list short--several of these songs I will describe as genius, those being: \\"Le temps des souvenirs\\" (Disc 2, cut 3), \\"No ce n'est pas un rêve\\" (Disc 2, cut 8),  and \\"Voil&agrave;\\" (Disc 2, cut 23).  \\"Je changerais d'avis\\" (Disc, 2, cut 17), \\"L'amour ne dure pas toujours\\" (Disc 1, cut 13--featuring interesting jazz-blues organ accompaniment), \\"On se quitte toujours\\" (Disc 1, cut 15), and \\"Nous &eacute;tions amies\\" (Disc 1, cut 25) number among the other memorable selections.  Ms. Hardy is at her best when expressing the anguish of romance gone wrong.  I also recommend her CD, \\"Comment Te Dire Adieu\\"--although I prefer \\"The Vogue Years\\".<br /><br />Stephen C. Bird, Author of \\"Hideous Exuberance\\"
B001F12J0C|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer and he was very surprised.  Ordering was quick and easy and the delivery was faster then the date that was given.   Thanks Amazon for a great job!
B001AP11LQ|4.0|I first heard this band when the documentary about their Canadian tour played on TV.  I was impressed by the energy and sound that could come out of only two performers.  I bought this CD because of that initial exposure and was not disappointed.  The same energy I saw on the screen was evident on this album.  I was also impressed with the song writing.  I will definitely be purchasing more music from this duo.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|This is a great knife that won't dissappoint you. The only thing i don't like is that the sheath doesn't retain the blade without the retention strap, and the sharp edges on the back.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|The Stones hit their zenith with Mick Taylor and this concert shows why.  This concert (1972) comes from the five year period (1969-1974) when he was their lead guitarist and they were on top of the charts with three #1 hits. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were writing great songs during this period.  Everybody was playing great, but Mick's guitar playing gave them an edge in live concerts and credibility as the self-proclaimed \\"greatest rock and roll group of all time.\\"  However good they were, with Mick Taylor they were 50% better than the Brian Jones era or the Ron Wood period that came after! The concert footage is fine, and shouldn't be compared with current film techniques, and the soundtrack is equally good although Mick Taylor's playing is mixed down, giving it less prominence than in the bootlegs. The original recording needed a lot of restoration, according to Mick Jagger and was enhanced for this release.  Along with the concert, there is additional footage of the group practicing before the concert and two Mick Jagger interviews, one from 1981 and one from 2010 in which he describes, in the latter, how the group was then, and how things have changed in the interim. Jagger claimed he didn't know why the footage has been unreleased all these years but the real reason may be that Mick Taylor was in it. For a long time, Keith Richards held a grudge against Mick Taylor for leaving the Stones (see his autobiography, \\"Life\\" and it is still evident after all these years) that resulted in the suppression of some of their greatest work and a denial of performance royalties to Mick Taylor. After a short run, this movie was shelved for years after Mick T left the group, and available only as a bootleg movie.  The \\"glimmer twins\\" have admitted publicly that they are annoyed with fans who prefer the \\"Mick Taylor era\\" to the earlier era with Brian Jones or the more recent era with Ron Wood.  Maybe one day they will get over it and share the royalties of this release, and the Exile On Main St. re-release, and other recordings from this era with Mick Taylor.  I hope they do.  We can only hope they will play together again, one day, perhaps for a final tour. It would be an instant sell out.
1594200106|5.0|I started this book expecting a book that would be respectable but slightly boring and not much of a page turner, I was wrong. It was a fascinating novel that's plot was based on much more than a boy's love of a book. There was mystery and plot twists all throughout the story that had me racing to the end. The writing itself was some of the best I have read in a long time, possessing a beautiful, poetry-like quality. The story is a bit dark, but it did not feel overdone. Some books try to hard to be dark and dramatic to the point that as a reader I am rolling my eyes at the events, yet in the Shadow of the Wind, although I could not relate at all to what was happening to the characters, their reactions and the explanations for everything that happens is so believable and powerful that you really begin to feel as if you are a part of the story. It was an amazing book; read it!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this book was really good. i just wish we didnt have to wait so long for the next one to come out.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Movie is a sobering view in reality around the world, that everywhere people struggle tremendously to make it trough our short time on Earth
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|There's nothing new I can say negatively about this movie that other reviewers have not already said in other 1, 2, or 3 star reviews.  In a nutshell I felt the series suffered from a lack of a cohesive story, strong character development, good dialog, and tension.  I also agree it went over the top on the sex scenes and the gore.  As a huge fan of the BoB series I was quite disappointed in The Pacific and doubt I will watch it again anytime soon.  I do rate it 3 stars though because of the good production quality, cinematography, and some parts of the series were redeeming, particularly episodes 9 & 10.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|Another great album from Ye! This one is a little more subtle but just as great. He is influenced by so many different genres this album is not only for hip hop fans. This is just GOOD music.
0439023521|5.0|My 14 year old girls coerced me into reading this book.  I have to say that after reading the jacket cover I was not overly inclined to do so, but they don't often ask me to read what they are reading so I felt I should give it a shot.  Well, I must say that I was completely surprised to not only enjoy it, but to become completely engrossed in the world of Panem.      I won't spend time discussing the premise of the book- lots of other reviews on this site go through that in detail.  What I can say is the author does a brilliant job immediately drawing you into the book no matter what your age.  If you are looking for a way to kill a plane trip- this book is your answer!  If you are looking for a trilogy to read by the pool on vacation- this is definitely your answer!      My only advice for you is to have the trilogy on hand, because once you start, you simply must finish!  These books will alternately thrill, anger, sadden and lift you.  They aren't pleasant, but they are well worth reading!  My girls loved every minute of my reading- constantly asking where I was and what was happening.  It was a nice bonding experience that we don't often get over books. My wife is now on the third book and loves it as much as I do.      I would also say to all the guys out there that don't do well with women authors, give Suzanne Collins a try.  I typically prefer male authors as well, but this lady can write for everybody.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|The movie arrived really quickly. It was great and really convenient. I searched for this movie in stores but didn't find it... I'm glad, I got a much better deal here.
0805087184|5.0|My 14 month old has loved this book for many months now. In fact, out of all of his books, this is the only one that is so beat up that I am going to have to replace it for my next little son, due this spring.  Baby will hand us this book to read to him over and over again. My version is a small board book, a good size for little hands. Pictures are nice, not familiar with the older version mentioned by some other reviews, but my baby enjoys this version just fine. If you only buy a few books for your little one, I highly recommend this one, along with \\"Moo, Baa, La La La\\" and \\"Art for Baby.\\" Oh, all of the Usbourne \\"That's not my....dog/puppy/monkey/etc\\" books are good too. These have been big hits with my son, he's enjoyed them more and more as he's gotten older and hasn't tired of them yet.
0399536108|5.0|This may be my favorite book - couldn't put it down.  A lot of similarities to the 4 Hour Work Week (Tim Ferriss), but for some reason I liked Chris's approach better (no Indian outsourcers for one).  Also, he seems like much more of a \\"bootstrapper\\", although I don't know that to be true.  This book just seemed more practical - some similar advice to 4HWW - but I loved his Manifesto - do yourself a favor and download it at - [...]  I think most \\"A\\" personalities, who like the idea of controlling their own destiny will really enjoy this.
0545123275|5.0|I can't believe I had this book in my TBR pile for so long.  Stepanie Meyer needs to watch her back, this was better than Twilight.  I can't wait to read Linger now.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|While this album is somewhat celebrated as the \\"return\\" of the mighty Soundgarden, it is merely just a collection of Greatest Hits, demos, and one previously unreleased track that was recorded during the Badmotorfinger sessions.  \\"Black Rain\\" is the name of the song, and once you listen to it, you'll wonder why the group decided not to include it on the album.  For me, as a collector and huge fan of the band, Telephantasm was worth the purchase just for that one song and to catch a glimpse at the liner notes.  The album artwork is typical Soundgarden and is quite unique and appealing.<br /><br />Purchasing this album depends on your perspective of how you decide to support the band or not.  This is not Soundgarden's comeback album, but it's something new in over 10 years and it's the return of one of the greatest bands ever assembled.
0439023521|5.0|I think that you should look at the 1 ratings before you buy this book. I agree with them 100%. The reviews are actually suggesting that the literature is so cleverly composed that it is disturbing to these readers -and I feel for them, honestly. I feel for them as the graphic language is not for all, so be aware of the content coming your way.<br /><br />From my side I love a range of literature. I bought this as it was presented at Columbia University during a presentation I attended there and decided to read this to my daughter. My daughter is young, 8, but is OK with such concepts as we have learnt about the issues in Sudan, about the Rwandan Crisis, and Hitler's genocidal work in WWII. For her the book was pale in comparison to the graphics offered in such documentaries, but when followed with discussion and reflection I hope it helps her become a better individual for our world later on in life.<br /><br />If you like adventure, challenges, determination, and would like to follow Katniss develop in this book - you will be captivated. Simply look at the statistics with over 1000 5s and a handful of 1s, and the 1s even credit the quality of writing! Use discretion - and if you think this is a genre of book you would like to try you probably will not be disappointed.
159102594X|4.0|Every year one of my old college buddies sends me one or two sci-fi/fantasy novels for my birthday. Knowing my disdain for pop-fiction writers like John Grisham (What, a lawyer at the heart of a conspiracy? Amazing!)or self-important fantasy blowhards like George RR Martin (it's 2011 and ADWD is STILL nearly finished... or maybe that was his career? Oh well, let's watch some Jets and Giants and forget about it), my friend always tries to show me authors that care more about characters and story than making money, movies and miniseries. Sometimes he has succeeded (John Scalzi, and yes, A Game of Thrones too) and sometimes his suggestions were a little too far off the beaten path (Accelerando, Perdido Street Station).    This year it was \\"Spin\\" by Robert Charles Wilson and \\"The Blade Itself\\" by Joe Abercrombie. This review covers The Blade Itself.    Fantasy novels are, quite frankly, extremely easy to do poorly. Barbarian. Wizard. Brave knight. Cowardly knave. Occasional she-devil, be she Nubian warrior or redhead with a big sword. All these characters are well-known to fans of the genre, as are their exploits. Quest to end of the earth to get/destroy magical item/treasure/water fowl, which will save the world from darkness/destruction/enslavement/Ryan Secrest. I've seen and enjoyed all this (except the RS-free world, but a man can dream), so a fantasy writer had better make it fun for me.    Joe Abercrombie succeeds for two reasons, the first being the characters he designed for this story. You have Logen Ninefingers (Lo-gen, of the NINE fingers...), aka the Bloody Nine, barbarian from the North who trades in Conan's utter lack of humanity for world-weariness and a palpable sense of impending damnation for his many sins. You have arrogant Jezal Luthar, who you want to hate so much that by the end of the book you are actually angry that he's part of the quest and not a stain on the rug. You have Ferro the aforementioned she-devil, who comes across as a female Kratos- not very deep, but oh so awesome. Finally, you have my favorite fantasy character of the last decade, Inquisitor Sand dan Glokta, the torturer with a heart of gold.    Second, since every chapter is entirely from one character's point-of-view (at least until the forming of the quest)you get to see each character first from their inner thoughts, until another POV character actually \\"sees\\" what they look like. The first time you \\"meet\\" Logen from another character's POV is one of the great moments of the book, and the multiple POVs make the dynamics of the quest interesting enough to wonder what they will be doing when they leave on the quest.    Unfortunately, this event happens at the end of the novel, leaving us with very little in the way of actual events. War is brewing but not yet started. Glokta finds out a conspiracy just in time to be sent on his next one. And the quest leaves for... somewhere, to find... something. I forgive this abrupt end because 1) it's a trilogy, and 2) Abercrombie actually finished said trilogy, probably because he spent his time writing books instead of writing about how he has no time to write books. Just sayin'.    I finished this 530-pager in a few nights and immediately got my hands on Before They Are Hanged. Fantastic book that entertained me and left me wanting more. Highly recommended.
B001G619C0|5.0|This set appears to have been intended for sale in Europe - one of the ratings labels on the cover appears to be for the Irish Film Censor's Office. Being that I live in the US and was aware of the regional coding issues present with a lot of DVDs, I was a little nervous about buying this. I read up online about region coding on Blu-Rays and apparently it's used a lot less than in the DVD era and one source indicated that Universal doesn't region code their Blu-Rays at all.<br /><br />I decided to try this set out due to the price difference between this version and the US labeled one. I use a PS3 for a Blu-Ray player and the discs work perfectly. I have a TON of language choices - I'll only use one, but that may be helpful to others out there. Other than that, absolutely no difference as far as the movie content and special features.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the gamble.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I like action movies, but this was totally stupid, the girl who was tortured by Eric Roberts then tells her dad to stop before he kills Eric is just one small act of stupidity. Enough said. Don't waste your money, I'm glad I only paid 12.99 for it and that was 12.00 too much.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is the perfect edition.  Movie quality is perfect and we finally get to see how the movie was made.  AWESOME!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|there's nothing more entretaining than seeing personalities crash. but more amazing is how everything is within the realms of physics and pseudo-science that takes on the best of X-Files and melt it with the best writing LOST can have with dosis of humor and amazing chemestry of the leads. the real find is ms torov which plays agent Dunham and Joshua Jackson who is Peter, and the funny Walter never ceases to amazing. what a trio that keeps this show running. i cant wait to get season 2..and for all naysayers, all i have to say is that have an open-mind and let the beauty of this show which is its character exploration get into your skin. you'll love this characters and its dynamics and its personality quirks and traits...you'll fall in love with the sarcastic-witty Peter, and the intoxicatingly-savvy Olivia, and the mental-patient-highly-intelligent-not-so-crazy Walter! awesome show, awesome time!
B0036MDN80|5.0|I purchased this toy for my eight year old little girl (who loves it) and I was very positively impressed with the quality and detail of this toy. I usually buy another more expensive brand of figurines but, frankly, Papo seems to give them a run for their money.  Will be buying papo again
B00008YLV2|5.0|Seeing wars played out on the big screen is so diffrent then actully being there!  This movie does a good job by putting you in the mist of it all.  As a parent of a Black Hawk Pilot, it has helped me to come to terms of why my child has chosen to put his foot on that line.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|This television series has been me and my husbands favorite! We do not have television so we started to rent the series and got hooked! You will not be disappointed with Season 8- we just got done with it and we were on the edge of our seats the whole time. It is kinda slow at the beginning, trying to re-introduce everyone but once it gets going, it never stops!!! I definitely recommend this season to anyone who loves drama, action and some serious Bower moves! :)
0451196716|4.0|While I like this one the best, there are several other Bachman stories worth reading.  The other well known Bachman story is \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"Thinner\\", which were released as a movie.  I notice that these titles are all available separately for around $8.00 but they were once published as a set, and this set can be bought used for around $5.00.  There is also a Kindle version of this. It is well worth reading all of them to truly appreciate SK at this stage in his writings.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Bachman-Books-Novels-Richard-Regulators/dp/0451191935<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/[[ASIN:0452277752 The Bachman Books : Four Early Novels by Richard Bachman (Rage / The Long Walk / Roadwork / The Running Man)]]<br />gp/product/B003BKZW40<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BKZW40

B00436GNVC|3.0|As the title suggests, the lyrics and melodies repeat, over and over, to the point of hoping for relief. Listening is a tolerance testing exercise!  Duffy has unique tonal quality, but enough is enough.  Any repitition perceived in this review is intentional.
B00008CMR6|4.0|Released in 1970, Howard Hawks' &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; starts with a thrilling Confederate train robbery of a Union gold shipment. After the war, Col. McNally (John Wayne) befriends Confederate Capt. &#34;Frenchie&#34; (Jorge Rivero) and his sergeant (Christopher Mitchum) to try to track down the Union traitors indirectly responsible for the gold robberies and the death of his close comrade and spiritual son. The trail leads to the West Texas town Rio Lobo and a showdown.<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />The opening credits features an exceptional two-guitar piece by Jerry Goldsmith with the camera zeroed-in closely on an acoustic guitar and the guitarist's hands. Sometimes I put the movie on just to see this part. The following half hour involves an excellent Confederate train robbery followed by the ensuing conflicts, which really make the film stand out from other Westerns. It's a great sequence, convincing and original. Civil War devotees should seek out &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; just for this.<br /><br />Three notable women are featured: Jennifer O'Neill, Susana Dosamantes and Sherry Lansing, the latter of whom went on to became president of 20th Century-Fox and, later, chairman of Paramount Pictures (she's the scarred girl Wayne more or less rides off into the sunset with). I've heard jokes/comments over the years about the number of babes in the town of Rio Lobo, most single. But, really, there's only two in the town: Maria (Susan), who is seeing Frenchie's comrade (Mitchum), and Lansing, who isn't all that exceptional anyway; O'Neill was just passing through as part of some snake oil show.<br /><br />The protagonists have good chemistry and camaraderie. The film was made right after the advent of the Spaghetti Western, which was known for amorality and lack of character depth. The protagonists in Italo Westerns were almost always antiheroes rather than heroes and caricatures rather than characters. They were grim, silent, one-dimensional killing machines, usually with dubious motivations (greed, revenge, lust) and just all-around comic-booky. While these types of characters are great when you're 13-20, they don't cut it when you're an adult and require more depth and realism. Don't get me wrong, the Spaghetti Westerns added (or perfected) a cool new style and grim sense of realism to the Western, but they accomplished this at the expense of morality, character depth and social realism. This explains why Clint Eastwood combined elements of both to forge the exceptional &#34;The Outlaw Josey Wales&#34; in 1976 after the decline of the Italo Western. Needless to say, it's nice to have a group of likable characters in &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; that get along and for whom you can root.<br /><br />An exceptional example of this good-natured camaraderie is shown in the middle of the film before the protagonists reach Rio Lobo. McNally, Frenchie and Shasta are camping out in the desert where a running joke starts concerning McNally being &#34;comfortable&#34; for women (but not romantically attractive). I love this sequence.<br /><br />There are great Arizona locations (along with Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico). In the Civil War sequences they did a pretty good job of pretending it was the East. Speaking of which, I like how the movie covers a lot of ground and isn't one-dimensional in setting. Critics complain that this makes the story disjointed when it's actually a positive thing.<br /><br />NEGATIVES or SUPPOSED NEGATIVES:<br /><br />The second half's plot concerning the political corruption in Rio Lobo is convoluted and my mind tends to wander at various points. So the story is compelling in the first half, but not so much in the second. Thankfully, the quality characters and the setting keep me watching.<br /><br />Some have complained about the acting, particularly O'Neill, Rivero and Mitchum, but is this their fault or the writer's? I just chalk it up to the distinctiveness of the actors. I've met numerous unique people in life who act peculiarly, but it's really just their special individuality or style. Gary Cooper & John Wayne are good examples. I think that's the case here more than anything.<br /><br />A couple scenes are unconvincing. For instance, when Frenchie suddenly darts into a house where Lansing's character is dressing, which is their first meeting; the ensuing conversation just doesn't smack of reality. I suppose the filmmakers were shooting for something romantically amusing, but it seems patched in from another movie. Another example is the episode where the protagonists raid the ranch house at night: People are lurking just around the corner and they aren't able to hear the nearby ruckus? Why sure!<br /><br />The opening score is only heard a few more times, briefly, but not with guitars like the opening. This composition is too great to be heard in such a limited capacity. Why not at least utilize it for the ending?<br /><br />&#34;Rio Lobo&#34; has slight similarities to Hawks & Wayne's &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; (1959) and &#34;El Dorado&#34; (1967), but &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; is far from a remake, as some suggest. It has an altogether different story.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Yes, the story is disjointed and there are a couple unconvincing scenes, but &#34;Rio Lobo&#34; possesses several aspects that are really good and even great, like the opening score/guitar sequence, the thrilling train robbery & Civil War parts, the likable protagonists & their camaraderie, the beautiful women and great locations.<br /><br />The film runs 114 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B- (a weak 4/5 Stars or strong 3/5 Stars)yne are good examples.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|This show is so well written, so real!  It stays so true but interjects humor and you actually believe the characters and empathize with them.  With so much crap on tv now it is good to see a show with substance.  The casting is awesome, each one is so believable.  You have to watch this show, you will be soooooo hooked!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is everything mentioned in other reviews and more.  My only caution is to heed to the advice of another reviwer, and try to avoid reading reviews before the book.  Reading the first third of the book without expectations about the rest will surely help you to fully understand and identify with the narrator, Jack.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room kept me in suspence the entire way through. I wept for joy, I cursed out loud, I wished for more. I will read all of Emma Donoghue's novels.

0393072231|4.0|This book added a lot to my understanding of Wall Street greed and basically amoral behavior by the self annoited \\"masters of the universe\\". It does a good job of describing the complicated and hidden financial transactions and that the public and our regulators did not understand, know was happenning, or comprehend the risk introduced to the entire financial system to enrich a few shrewd financial \\"geniuses\\".   Note some understanding of stocks, bonds, options, and insurance is helpful in understanding the decription of the financiqal trnasactions in this book.

B0046MOVD0|4.0|I just bought this on Blu-ray from another source since Amazon won't have it available for a few more days.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the RE series since the beginning and this movie didn't disappoint. There's plenty of action and terrific special effects, crystal clear in Blu-ray. Not as much gore as I expected though. If you're just looking for a fun action flick, this is a good way to spend 90 minutes.
0064407667|5.0|I read this book as an adult and loved it.  It may be a bit scary for younger kids.
0316017922|3.0|This book is readable and entertaining.  Will you learn anything new about success from it?  Only if you have not been paying attention to life.  Sucess is a combination of probability and effort.  You don't need an entire book to tell you that.

B002XTXG1G|4.0|This is positively the strangest movie I've seen I think in my entire life.  It's basically a prison movie on acid and makes A Clockwork Orange look like an episode of Friends.  It's stylishly filmed and Tom Hardy is fantastic but so so strange.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|(Unrated version) WARNING: This review may contain unintentional plot spoilers. The movie had me hooked about 20 minutes into it. Angelina Jolie spends 2 years in a N.Korean prison out of the reach of Jimmy Carter. She is released in a spy swap. She works for a dummy CIA company in New York which doesn't have a metal detector sophisticated enough to detect knife blades inside of shoes. After Jolie is back in NYC, a Russian defector comes in from the cold and tells us, and the CIA, the plot of the movie. He claims Angelina (Salt) is really a Russian mole, planted here as a child and she is going to kill the Russian president. Salt denies this, and runs away before she could clear herself in order to save her husband. There are numerous minor flashbacks during the movie to fill in plot points. They also make the predictable \\"twists\\" predictable enough for dummies.<br /><br />The film makes fun of the real Angelina who can't cook, but can do everything else. She can make a better cannon than William Shatner out of household items. Bobby Clark (Gorn)in a rubber mask would not have stood a chance. She can scale a building in her bare feet and split skirt better than Spider Man (or Spider Babe for Misty Mundae fans). Salt can also jump from the top of truck to truck, better than Tom Cruise and that is after taking a bullet to the hip, which doesn't even give her a limp. Jolie can ride a motorcycle as well as Evel Knievel and can beat up men quicker than Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. I am not sure why the NYPD handcuffed people with their hands in the front. I guess the \\"behind the back\\" cuff would have made the escape too unbelievable. And Bruce Willis could have taken notes on how to climb down an elevator shaft from Salt.<br /><br />And during the whole time, her makeup never ran or hair came out of place. Okay, we'll forgive you about not being able to cook.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|This movie is a great addition to any movie collection. It is action-packed, well done, and visually stunning; and it is even better in Blu-Ray!!
B001FB5634|5.0|Holy Moley!  Whatever circumstances result in the life-or-death mess Viggo and his young charge find themselves in is horrendous.  A total breakdown of civilization is encountered as they make their way along the road. The cold, food and shelter become their prime concerns as they avoid dangerous humans who have reverted to the worst primal instincts of which man is capapable in order to just live, keeping body and soul together. This is a depressing look at an unidentified catastrophic event which forces those few survivors in civilization's ashes to try to survive.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|What is it that makes a memorable soundtrack for a film? It could be a memorable classical score, a great bunch of catchy songs, or a combination of each. Now, what happens if you take those two sounds and actually merge them into one? Well, when Tron Legacy was finally ready to go the director knew like its predicesor it still needed to be ahead of its time. That included the sound of the score. So apparently being a fan of the Electronica gurus Daft Punk, he went to them and the rest is history.<br /><br />I am not a big collector of soundtracks, but the select few I do have just have that certain something. The Tron Legacy soundtrack however has so much more! The score on this soundtrack is a phenomenal blend of electornica with a classical score and the pieces fit perfectly. The sound is fluid and hard hitting and soothing all at the same time. This kind of a collaboration has never been attempted and Daft Punk pulled it off and they should be damn proud.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of these kinds of sounds I promise you once you see how well it works with the movie as a whole you will run to the store and pick this up. The soundtrack actually moves the movie itself along and makes so much better. The Tron Legacy soundtrack is definitely going to set the bar for the way soundtracks are composed in the future and I would have been great to see this soundtrack get nominated for Best Origonal Score, but since the Academy is a bunch of clueless A**bags, another great piece of music gets over looked.
B004529NLG|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE. SOME AWSOME DANCING AND THE WAY THEY USED THE 3D FORMAT IS EXCELLANT!!! I JUST BOUGHT A NEW 3D SETUP AND THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT ON IT. BRINGS A WHOLE NEW WORLD TO HOME THEATER!! 5 STARS!!!!
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The Collector's Edition of Avatar is an awesome release for the fans of Avatar. The case is beautiful and the deleted scenes more than worth the time to go through. They fill in so much of Norm's character development and the reason behind his and Jake's initial conflicts. **SPOILER ALERT** Did you know that a love affair with Trudy is what turns his mood around?? Ya, HUGE surprise for me too. **END SPOILER ALERT**    I am however dissapointed that this edition did not come with a digital copy for my computer so that I can take it on the road with me. I am also dissapointed that some of the more advanced deleted scenes were not incorporated into this edition... is this a marketing ploy to release a \\"Super-extended Die-hard Collector's Edition\\"? I wouldn't be surprised, and as a result, my brother may get this edition as a gift like my father received my original lol
0060557818|3.0|I found this novel somewhat difficult to finish.  I actually debated discontinuing the read about half way through the work.  The story seemed to lack meaningful character development and replacing much needed 'why's' with a collection of random events/encounters in a world that was not all that fantastic.  In hindsight wondering to myself what all the hype was about, I did a little research.  I can only guess that this novel became a launching pad for other great works to spring from since the storyline was around in 1996.  One example would be a movie called 'Dark City' in the overall feel of the environment and villainy.  I honestly do not know, but being an avid fantasy reader in 2010 I did not find this novel to be particularly notable in comparison to works that I am accustomed to since 1996.  I give the novel 3 stars because I can see how other Author's and possibly screen writers works were influenced by the style and story of Neverwhere.
0316069485|3.0|I actually READ this book, rather than listening to the audio book (I had an autographed copy that I bought when I went to hear Connelly talk).   It blends three familiar characters --Mickey Haller, his half brother Harry Bosch, and Mickey's ex-wife, Maggie McPhearson (otherwise known as Maggie McFierce), but they are in unfamiliar roles--Haller is a prosecutor rather than a defense attorney, Bosch is working for Haller, rather than as a member of the police force, and Maggie takes second chair to Mickey.  FBI agent Gretchen Waller also makes an appearance.    The situation is that a man who has spent 24 years in prison because he was convicted of murdering a 12 year old girl has had his case overturned based on new DNA evidence.  They have decided to re-try the case and put him back in jail.  This is a great book for learning how a court case is crafted, but it lacks a lot of the tension and adventure that permeates most of Connelly's books.   Oh there is a bit of tension, there is a hint of nefarious plotting and planning but I felt the ending petered out and could have been a bit more gut-wrenching.   There were also lots of loose ends that never got tied up.    But my brother in law LOVED it.  It was only his second Connelly book, so I think I would recommend it to anybody, but I, personally, didn't think it was one of his best.  At least not for my tastes.   Maybe I just needed Dick Hill's narration on an audio book!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Fixed my problem, and is a lot easier than taking the case off everyday.  I read other reviews that said the product would play sound but wouldn't charge.  That isn't an issue with this, as it maintains all the normal functions of the iPhone.  Definately would recommend this product
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Opinions about Appaloosa are very mixed.  I watched it on DVD and enjoyed it.  Not the best Western ever but not bad and certainly better than a number of the comic books done over the past 20 years.  I would rate it as good to very good. It is clichéd but that is part of being true to this genre. Best Westerns ever:  The Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, Ride the High Country, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and the 2010 version of True Grit.  The Shootist, Monte Walsh, Will Penny, The Cowboys, and Bad Company are also good.  The Long Riders and The Assassination of the Outlaw Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are also worthwhile.    I cite the above to give the reader an idea of my taste in films.  I like Eastwood's spaghetti westerns but don't consider them great movies.  I think Once Upon a Time in the West should be seen by anyone interested in western movies.  Tombstone is wild but tiring. I purchased but don't particularly care for Open Range. Lonesome Dove is a masterpiece of film even if it was made for the small box.  Perhaps the best western movie of all time is Lonely are the Brave (also known as the Brave Cowboy) but it is a modern western like Hud.  Hombre is one of the best adaptations of an Elmore Leonard story and almost any of the movies based on Leonard's stories or novels is worth watching.    So in my opinion, Appaloosa is good but not great.
0596806027|3.0|I like books and don't mind paying for good content such as this, but if you feel differently, you should know is that the book is derived from its freely available HTML5 source at [...]. This is good to know (it is explained in the Preface, though some people seem to miss this) even for those of you who prefer physical media, as it is easier to explore the live examples on the web site than it is to imagine them while reading the print version.    Overall, this is a nice survey of the most popular APIs/features formalized by HTML5. As the spec for HTML5 has not been finalized yet, it would be unfair to expect a Definitive Guide for HTML5 at this stage. That is not to say that the book's discussion of HTML5 is too superficial to provide any practical information for developers -- far from it! The book is rife with code samples that can be used today in the browser(s) that support the features of HTML5 being discussed.    I am especially impressed and grateful for the detailed discussion of video on the Web. It was extremely thorough and would have been extremely painful to research on my own. This is the type of detailed knowledge and broad perspective that does not fit into a brief StackOverflow Q&A.     However, at times, some of the examples come across as repetitive because they build on top of one another very slowly (especially with the Modernizr examples in Chapter 2 and the microdata examples in Chapter 10). I suspect this is advantageous if you jump back into the middle of a chapter for reference and don't want to read the previous sections to reestablish context, but if you're reading the chapter straight through (which is reasonable as it's a fairly short book), then it feels a bit sluggish.    One pet peeve of mine is the abundant use of bit.ly URLs in the book. On one hand, it is easier to type an abbreviated URL (like those produced by bit.ly) when reading off of the print version, but on the other hand, it obfuscates the domain of the destination link, which I often use as a signal of the quality of the content. For example, is it a link to an official w3c.org site or some arbitrary rant from a blogger on blogspot.com? With a bit.ly URL, there is no way of knowing without visiting the link.    Finally, Chapter 3 contains a number of diagrams drawn using ASCII art. This gives the impression that this is a dump of a web site into book form rather than an dedicated effort at polishing something for print media.    Ironically, I was most happy with this book until I read the appendix on feature detection that uncovered a whole host of HTML5 features that I realized were not discussed elsewhere in the book! (This caused me to drop my rating from 4 stars down to 3.) At this point, I realized that I was not nearly done learning about what HTML5 has to offer. Examples of topics that are only mentioned in the appendix include command, iframe sandbox, iframe srcdoc, and Undo, to name a few. What's worse is that this list did not even include a sentence or two to explain what each of these features are, or a URL where more information could be found.

0307341550|5.0|I saw Gillian Flynn over the summer at the Printer's Row book festival in Chicago.  She was on a discussion panel with some other authors and something about the way she talked about her books and writing made me want to try this book.  Well, I did and I thought it was a fantastic book.<br /><br />A Chicagoland reporter heads back to her hometown to get the scoop on some murder/abductions involving teenage girls.  Years away from this past place called home but she still has the scars of her past when she arrives into town.  This dark mystery of a small town is very interesting with the contrast of characters and secrets they hide.  Excellent bubbling suspense and an impressive ending.<br /><br />This is going to be very close to the top for my best reads of the year.  I look forward to her next book, DARK PLACES.
B0042816YK|3.0|I wish I'd read some reviews of the movie before attempting to watch it. EAT, PRAY, LOVE, the book, didn't translate at all well to a movie. This film is made up of  too many disjointed scenes with brief introductions to characters so you don't really get to know or care about the people. The acting seemed flat. And, though at the beginning of the book, I was bothered by the author's self-absorption, her story grew on me through her depictions of the people who surrounded her in each country, particularly India and Bali. In the movie, she comes across self-absorbed the entire time.<br /><br />I found the interactions with Richard in India and some of the early scenes with the medicine man in Bali somewhat engaging. But overall, I'd suggest reading the book and skipping this movie.
B002ZG980U|4.0|INCEPTION    There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it was released and all I would hear from people was \\"you have see this flick\\". I skipped going to see it in theaters because most of the time I am let down when something is overly hyped. So like I do with a lot I waited until the DVD release to finally catch this film. I must say that I am glad I waited and let the hype factor die down because I did enjoy this movie. I also will say that if I had been paying attention and realized Cillian Murphy was in this I may have went and seen it on the big screen.    If you have yet to see this I can assure you that what you have heard is true, you do have to follow what is going on the whole time [kinda]. Well at least at first but once you know the rules the film is playing by it becomes easier to guess what is coming. The film starts out with our Dream robbers inside the mind of a man who will become one of the center parts of this story. When we learn that you can be in a dream inside a dream things start to heat up. But once out the question is asked \\"can you plant an idea in some one's mind like you can steal info from them\\". This question is pressed by the man they just tried to steal from and he offers the thieves a job. So the plan starts to be laid out as a team is assembled to do what most think is impossible.    Written and directed wonderfully by Christopher Nolan this movie combines elements of other films and styles to create a very intriguing world. The effects and twists of the story keep you interested the entire time, and it is a long film. Take for example the building of the dream, when you see what \\"the human mind\\" can come up with and all the things it can add to these worlds are amazing. Visually this film is near flawless but there are other factors that bring it down. Such as when you figure out the film, you figure it out, sure the twists are there but you can kinda guess what is coming.    And while the film takes a while it does andsome great actors keeping things going, one of my favorites Cillian Murphy is the mark in this movie. Of course lead Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job here as does Ken Watanabe who is actually a favorite in the film as he did a great job. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as well was great as Leo's number one guy, Marion Cotillard was excellent as Leo's wife in this movie, Ellen Page as the dream weaver, Tom Hardy was another wonderful addition to the film, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Dileep Rao all did great jobs as well. Add in a wonderful soundtrack and you a very good film.    This was a really good film and worthy of the praise it got but I feel like it fell just short of classic status. Maybe because the characters were not as developed as much as the plot was or something but it felt kinda incomplete. I don't know maybe I am crazy, you tell me. However feel about the film I am sure everyone can agree that it is at the very least worth a rental right.
0446563048|5.0|I chose to read this book for a leadership class, so I didn't expect much when I bought it, but it turned out to be a really great book--I was definitely WOWed! Zappos is truly an amazing company run by a down-to-earth CEO. While it spends more time talking about Tony Hsieh's life than I initially anticipated, getting that background glimpse into his life lays a great foundation for the rest of the book and shows why the company is the way it is. It was a very easy read (Hsieh mentions that he wrote the book without the help of a ghost writer in order to allow his true personality to shine through), and I highly recommend it!
0003303187|4.0|Lovely book. Nicely written. If you didn't want to go to the Greek isles before, you will after you read this.
0802473156|5.0|This book was recommended to us by a marriage counselor we were seeing for the third time in a last ditch effort to save our marriage.  After both my husband and I read it and learned how the other person ticks and how to relate to his or her needs... it literally saved our marriage.  We both believe in this book so much we gave two of our sons who are now married each a copy of it.  We wrote a passage in each book to them telling them that reading it will help their marriage in so many ways in hopes of them not making some of the mistakes we have made over the past 20 years.  We hope this is one of those times they actually listen to us... LOL!!  After reading it we both said, \\"why didn't we read this a long time ago it could have saved us from a lot of heartache and resentment towards one another\\"?  It's a must read for any meaningful long term relationship whether married or not.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|The Script's first album was amazing and yet somehow they have written a second album that's even better. Listen to any song on the album and I dare you not to relate to the lyrics. Great job guys. I can't wait for many more songs to come. :)
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I just started reading the book an aready love it.I am realy excited to finish it. I also recomend that others read it to.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|Yes, Paul W Anderson, the director of Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, used the same Fusion 3D camera set up as Avatar, evidenced by the film credits and 3D featurette on the 3D Blu Ray, which also plays standard 2D. The 3D as a result, looks excellent and better than most 3D films out there, excluding Imax's Studio Nature productions. From the opening to the end, everything pops out far greater than you might have seen. The rain in RE:A3D looks spectacular and the depth really shines as though you're \\"in the movie\\". This is what 3DHDTV was made for. If you miss this and own a 3DTV, your loss if you like action movies.<br /><br />The movie has elements of the Matrix's fight scenes and slow motion, with The Walking Dead's zombie infested city. The film covers Alaska, Tokyo and Los Angeles. The opening action scene is a highlight and really slick, packed with blazing machine guns and acrobatics. There's also a Axe man scene worth buying this disc for alone, and a cool but short end fight scene with RE5's Albert Wesker. The story is a basic \\"escape plan\\" movie, but in the RE style. This is the best one so far IMO.<br /><br />The featurettes are 47 minutes total, and informative, including cast interviews. There's also a screen in screen presentation, director commentary track, deleted and extended scenes and more.<br /><br />Overall, if you own or eventually plan to buy a 3DHDTV, buy this version for a few extra bucks, as it plays in regular 2D on regular HDTV's and players and looks great in 2D, but exceptional in 3D.<br />Movie: 8/10<br />3D: 9/10<br />Extras: 7/10
B0033807C2|5.0|This is a really good book. Fast moving, entrataining. Like other Pecy Jackson series it is hard to get the book down once you start reading. A really, really good book. :)

B001H122N4|5.0|This set is a real must for any Pink Floyd collector - definately worth getting the extra CD (over the four disc set, which I already had) and the extras in the pack (I won't spoil it by telling you what they are) are to die for.  If you're in Europe, import this from the States and save yourself £100+ (make sure it's in a DVD region you can play!)
B003Y58CKS|4.0|Overall, this was mainly well done but my quibbles keep me from loving it.  First to mind is the production while passable makes me wish other choices had been made.  Keeping Gilda in her bedroom for the entire first act -- metaphorically or not -- makes for credulity problems when encountering the Duke in the initial seduction scene (are we to believe he rapes her then and there...? and later too?...or??).  However, the final bedroom scene in the room with the night sky and stars simulated was effective in conveying her \\"starry-eyed\\" emotional state.     And of course, I must be an old fuddy-duddy (very probable), but having partially nude party party guests in the opening scenes distracts me from the story being told and the singing being done...and after all, \\"the play's the thing\\". I am not so jaded as to find nude women (or men) business as usual, so I must deal with my squirmy distracted-from-the-opera-itself feelings because of it. I \\"get it\\"...the duke's a libertine and his court is dissolute --- I don't need to have a cartoon picture drawn with big black crayon and then a flashing neon arrow pointing to the \\"sexed-up bits\\".  Likewise when the duke was mechanically \\"feeling up\\" Maddelena....unnecessary and distracting.    Diana Damrau was wonderful..vocally secure and detailed...and dramatically good although I felt was playing Gilda, not being Gilda.  I never felt much for her in her portrayal, she just seemed so darned competent, not vulnerable and naive, but all things considered she was super. Lucic had very good moments, although his voice is limited and was not ideal.  His portrayal likewise had some very good moments -- he is a believable Rigoletto and a very like-able actor/singer.    In my view, Florez was not a success.  He is not a natural stage actor and his nervousness and discomfort transmit strongly to the viewer.  His voice didn't quite reach to all the corners and crannies of the role and frankly disappeared here and there.  I could have enjoyed him nonetheless if he wasn't such an awkward-deer-in-the-headlights-terrified actor.  He was hands down the most unconvincing duke I have seen and I've seen a bunch (see fuddy-duddy remark above).     Loved the Sparafucile...a real black bass at last!  The other players were unremarkable so I won't remark!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I had seen this one at the movie theatre but watching it with my wife and daughter made it more special.  I think Toy Story is the best animated movie.
B001U5V03U|4.0|While viewing this, I was not taken with Keelyside, in fact he was a bit repulsive to me.  I later digested it and found it/him to be very effective.  I don't know Keelyside's intention, but I have decided that the repulsiveness was deliberate.  This Don is jaded, burnt out, and bored to tears....but with no other ideas of how to live.  He gets progressively more sadistic and desperate for something, anything, to take and keep his interest. The exceedingly strange encounter with the Commendatore in the graveyard was welcome to him as a tonic for his boredom, and maybe death/hell was welcomed too as a hoped-for final end to it. The director's choice of showing the Don up to his old tricks in hell may not be viewed as consequence by some, but I could stretch my premise to say that forcing the Don to continue his earthly life in hell was an exquisitely well-chosen punishment.    Keelyside's age and stage are perfect for this Don, not really old but certainly not young. Vocally he is not the richest, canny certainly, but not with octaves and power to spare. Even his costume seemed to suggest this view. His same-in-all-acts-costume gave a tattered worn-out impression even before contrasting it with the rest of the aristocrat-principals who were well-groomed and dressed and had several costume changes.      The women all are very effective and Ramon Vargas is a treat in the role of Don Ottavio.  Leporello however didn't engage me vocally or as the character (he did fine, but...nothing special).  He seemed almost too healthy and hearty to be the servant of such a man for the long period of time it appears he has been. Some of the accumulated slime should have rubbed off from the played-out roue that is my view of this Don. Mazetto was OK, but not memorable.  All in all, this performance earns additional viewings for me (not the least to see if my impression holds).
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This is the first and in my opinion still the best of the Walt Longmire series.  I have read them all and reread several of them and they hold up well to rereads.  Johnson creates believable characters and manages plotting very well even though this is a debut novel.  There are some mystical elements that require a little suspension of disbelief, but such is the case with almost any book, and they are handled well.  The reader is engaged early, the plot moves along, the outcome is not apparent 'til the last few pages.  I believe this book was overlooked for the annual awards and should have received serious consideration for an Edgar. It's certainly worthy of award for best first novel in the mystery genre.  I have lived in Wyoming and spent a lot of time there over the years and he brings the state and the people to life in the book.  The later books continue with the same characters and are just as well characterized and written.  Each one brings a slightly different outlook, but this is as good a series as one finds in the mystery genre, easily as good as Parker's Jesse Stone series or Kathy Reich's Temperance Brennan and much better than much more highly acclaimed series such as Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Johnson has a ways to go, but if he keeps this up, he's going to approach the realm of icons like James Lee Burke.    I am disappointed that Amazon has chosen to keep the kindle price on this book so high.  I would like to add it, but not at the same price as the hardcover.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This album is awesome on so many levels. The producer, Andy Sneap is definitely the best producer they have ever had. The guitars are adrenaline rushing and the bass and drums are powerful. What you don't expect is the Marshall scorching vocals coming out of Mark Tornillo. He has great tone, control and presence that makes this album an onslaught of attitude for those who connect to Metal on a level for those who remember this kind of music as a life style. I hope this album goes far enough to be recognized by followers of Metal as a pivot point of what Metal was and can be.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I totally love this book, it is full of humor and vampire blunders........  If you are looking for a scary vampire this is not for you....I can't say that i love it enough.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Where I am coming from: I have owned both the Canon BG-E7 and the Vivitar 7D vertical grip, and I have read about the Zeikos.  I am an avid amateur shooter that normally shoots outdoors and time lapse, but is now trying studio photo shoots.  I have even gone as far as to purchase my own set of Alien Bees 800s.    Similarities:  All three of the above grips have the same redundant controls for vertical orientation while utilizing two standard batteries or 6AA batteries. They have the same controls, strap attachment point, and rubberized grip on front and bottom.    Differences:   The Vivitar and Zeikos have a small ridge that separates the index and middle fingers on the grip. The Canon battery door does feel more secure and the battery tray does have a slightly better fit. Finally, the Canon has the rubberized grip material on the battery door as well.  The Vivitar and Zeikos do not have that material on the battery door.    Results:  I went with the Canon because it has the rubberized grip material on the back of the battery door.  I have a large hand, the grip is large, and my thumb and part of my palm rest on that battery door which completes my hold on the vertical grip. By having that extra grip material, the camera feels more secure in my hand.  This is important considering in some shoots I might not be using a neck strap and am holding a $1500 camera with a $1000 lens that combined weigh several pounds. For me, the extra security was worth the price difference.  I understand that that means paying double, but replacing a dropped camera and lens is even more expensive.     Conclusion:  If the more secure feel of the Canon grip is important then get the Canon, if not the go for the Vivitar or Zeikos, they all do the same job.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I purchased this for a gift-it was exactly what my son wanted.  I appreciate the fast service & the product was as advertised.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I recall when they sort of hit the mainstream, with Songs for the Deaf, all the talk was about the earsplitting volumn, I suppose it was their live shows. Going deaf is not a good way to enjoy music. A shame since there is much to enjoy in their cataloge. A very interesting mix of metal, alt, rock; retro to garage to stoner, even a touch of folk.  And for me, it works, never a dull moment, even the occasional screamo (Six Shooter, Quick and Pointless, ah there is a pun in there) was not bothersome.
030746363X|2.0|I enjoy Tim's writing style and the most enjoyable points were his \\"memoir\\"-like stories--about going to a sperm bank, weighing his poop, etc.<br /><br />but his 'advice' left much to be desired.  Tim is constantly contradicting himself--particularly in the diet chapters. He'll tell you to do one thing, and a few pages later, say not to do it--without an explanation. The entire book reads bi-polar.<br /><br />I can't gauge all the information, because I'm not an expert in every field, but I am a certified personal trainer, and as any CPT or professional weight-lifter will tell you, you should never EVER lift weights in padded sneakers--Tim is in \\"sneakers\\" in all his demonstration pictures...if he is that uneducated about proper form... perhaps he's equally as inadequate with all his other advice?<br /><br />It also should be pointed out that if someone goes from processed foods to Tim's diet, they're going to lose weight, but they'd have lost weight just as fast if they'd just dropped the processed garbage and not tried \\"slow carb.\\" TF's \\"diet\\" is just a way to get you eating better foods and cutting out junk in a structured way... it's no \\"miracle\\" diet. It's the new South Beach meets Atkins... and it's not sustainable for life...<br /><br />You can lose just as much weight not following his diet and even eating carbs -- but as long as you're not eating junk foods. He didn't reinvent the wheel!
B003ZSI9YI|2.0|Very much a fan of the 60's Motown music - not impressed with the song choices or rendition - found the cd to be boring - usually like Phil Collins but this was a flop in my opinion - some songs should stay with the original artists and this is one cd that didn't make the grade.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|While watching this series, I always had the nagging thought in my mind as to what point of view the producers were taking with this.  Where were they coming from?  The negative view taken of American Soldiers is overwhelming.  Someone not knowing much about WWII would come out of this with a very skewed view of what really happened. I am sure that there were many men that were cruel and did many despicable things. On the other hand, there were many more that did their duty as best as they possibly could given the whole horrendous situation of a war that had to be fought. I kept waiting for a \\"why we fight\\" episode as they did in Band of Brothers, and it never came.  Let's not forget that the nation of Japan was responsible for this.  The deaths of millions of Chinese and hundreds of thousands of citizens of other countries were the sole responsibility of the nation of Japan.  It bothers me tremendously that we seem more concerned about the hundreds of thousands killed by the atomic bombs being used to end the war than the \\"millions\\" that were killed by the Japanese using conventional means.    The series did not flow.  I found it extremely difficult to feel anything for Leckie as he was portrayed, which in my mind, was immature and a total pr@#k.  Unfortunately, his role in the series was prevalent.  I knew about John Basilone, and it was difficult for me to follow his story when I knew the eventual outcome.  I wish that we could have become more familiar with the thoughts of Eugine Sledge.  It seemed like the the whole series was more visual than substance.    It, in my mind, is a watch it once miniseries.  I received the DVDs as a present.  I doubt that I will watch them again.  I have watched Band of Brothers many times.  I would only recommend this series to true fans of Military movies, history, etc.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This box set includes both the original movie releases and the new updated versions. It's great to be able to choose which one you want to watch. The only down side is the quality of the original versions. They do not fill a wide screen TV, they were recorded for the older 4:3 screens. You end up with black bars on all four sides, and the quality is not full DVD. But you have to realize they were not edited, remastered, added to or anything. You get what everyone saw in the theater. If you're looking for better quality, pop in the remastered version and enjoy some of the new features and better sound. Either way, this collection has two ways to enjoy a great movie trilogy.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Overview:<br /><br />Well we all know that this movie has groundbreaking graphics, The Computer Generated graphics are nothing short of astounding.<br /><br />Storyline/Plot:<br /><br />About 500 years ago the earth's first world people made fantastic ships to travel in. The objective was to reach the third world otherwise known as Pandora (Pan America). Upon the discovery of this world, they encountered the Na'vi (NAtiVe Indians), the blue-skinned, large-eyed people, who often painted their faces.<br /><br />For the most part, these people were regarded as being unlearned savages, a little better than monkeys that would live in the trees or primitive grass huts and tents.<br /><br />Because the inhabitants of Pandora were just so ignorant, the travelers made full claims to all of their lands and valuable natural resources. If there was any resistance, the travelers would use their far superior weaponry. The Na'vi's sticks and arrows of course were no match, and thousands of them were slaughtered without mercy.<br /><br />But there was one handicapped young man that fell in love with one of the Na'vi young women. Although their relationship was frowned upon, his leaders felt that it was ok to use, and leave her, as long as he kept his loyalties in the right perspective.<br /><br />Eventually he was made governor of that territory, and with the passage of time all the resistance dissipated and the Na'vi lands became peaceful territories again. As all the rich resources were drained off, the travelers decided to grant the Na'vi independence. However, because their land was now drained, they were unable to trade in a profitable way.<br /><br />So the travelers decided to set up inter-planetary banks, and would lend the Na'vi huge sums of money and attached onerous conditions, effectively enslaving them once again.

0743454537|4.0|My sisters keeper: a compelling read with a shocking ending! Have you ever looked at a book or read the first couple pages and think it will be horrible? That is exactly what you will not do when you first start to read My Sisters Keeper. When I first picked up this book, I couldn't put it down for days. Jodi Picoult has written and mastered another wonderful book. She has mastered it with another controversial topic and a lesson learned. There are many many challenging questions raised in this story and you will see many point of views about these questions in this book.     How was the book? It was good overall and I would give it a four out of five stars. But some parts in the book were just plain annoying. Especially Sara(mother). Picoult illustrates her as a stubborn, stuck up, selfish person. .She completely ignores her son Jesse like he isn't even a part of the family any more. She sees her daughter, Anna, as a walking donor for Kate who has leukemia. She never even asks Anna if she wants to be a donor. She is so caught up in trying to save Kate that she doesn't take time to see what the rest of her family wants and needs. Also I would have changed the ending. It is so surprising and shocking that it could potentially ruin the book for some people. But overall it was a good book and I would recommend it to other people.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This is the first book review that I have ever written. I hadn't read science fiction for a long time, although I had read sci-fi greats like Asimov, Heinlein, PKD, etc. earlier. I wanted a break from the dense, technical literature (nonfiction) I generally read and chose to read Old Man's War by John Scalzi because many reviewers said that it was a light, breezy novel. It has turned out to be quite true and I was able to finish it in a couple of sittings.     The premise of 75 year old humans joining a colonial defense army, with new bodies propped up with technology, is interesting. In the first part of the book, the narrator and his group of friends have no idea where they are going or what they are going to become. The process of realizing what the future holds for them is perhaps the most riveting part of the book. However, as some other reviewers have noticed, the characters behave more like 20-year old college kids, instead of people who have lived three-fourths of a century. This might be considered a flaw in the story or perhaps the author implies that's how 75-year old humans would be in the future!    In the rest of the book, the narrator goes through quite a few wars with aliens and several interesting characters and alien species are introduced. Saying more would perhaps give away the plot; one thing that is clear to me is that this book is a fun read. It gets 4 stars from me, because now, after reading the book, I feel that it could have been better if the author had made the sci-fi 'harder'. I will go now and read Vernor Vinge!

B00005K3NR|5.0|Stephen King's classic tale of teenage revenge is brilliantly brought to life in Brian De Palma's CARRIE! The poorly misunderstood Carrie White is tormented by her fellow classmates and scorned by an abusive mother, but her years of ridicule are now manifesting themselves into a powerful psychic force that she will use to avenge herself.<br /><br />De Palma opens with a soft, sensual shower scene that is highlighted by Pino Donaggio's magnificent score. The mood immediately shifts to pure psychological horror as Carrie is assaulted by the other girls after her first period causes her to panic in the locker room. These feelings of repressed anger and sadness will continue to build throughout the picture. Sissy Spacek's Oscar-nominated performance as Carrie is crucial to the film's success. Her shy and apprehensive take on the character is played to a flawless perfection, while her fiery inner anguish is unleashed like a phoenix in the climactic ending.<br /><br />CARRIE is lined by more fantastic performances from each of its supporting cast members, with Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, and John Travolta delivering menacing roles as the high school bullies. It is Amy Irving and William Katt that become the most interesting  of the teens as Sue and Tommy thanks to the growing ambiguity that is written into their characters. Tommy's charming smile can be read any number of ways, but always seems to allude to a vicious deception that never surfaces. It isn't until Sue's ironic ejection from the prom by Miss Collins that their true intentions are finally revealed.<br /><br />Piper Laurie's exaggerated portrayal of the crazed Mrs. White is taken to a state of super-villainy, with her religious zeal serving as a constant source of satire. De Palma uses countless visual clues to accentuate Mrs. White's domineering persona. She is typically shot from low angles in full-frame, giving her an imposing presence on-screen. This is opposed to the high angles that Carrie is filmed from, which depict her as a cowering child that is forced into the corner of the screen. Little notes, like the weathered \\"For Sale\\" sign next door or Mrs. Snell's general unease, also work against Laurie's character.<br /><br />De Palma uses many of his favorite techniques to create CARRIE's unique look, most notably in his use of split-screen and dual lenses to bring the foreground and background into focus simultaneously. In what may be De Palma's defining cinematic moment, the camera follows as the prom ballots are collected and swapped, tracing each of the co-conspirators before it ends up overlooking the prom from atop the fateful bucket of blood.<br /><br />CARRIE is Brian De Palma's greatest achievement within the genre, and one of Horror's finest films. It epitomizes the teen revenge thriller, both with its incredible cast and superb direction.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesering child that is forced into the corner of the screen.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|I love Star Wars. But this is a scam.  For most big Star Wars fans who want it on DVD- you'll puke when you see the bad additions.  I haven't seen the ORIGINAL ORIGINAL star wars in like 10 years!  I thirst for it!  But it is nowhere to be found!  Need to buy a VCR just to watch my old copy up in the attic someplace.    Ruined scenes:  Jabba the Hut appears in \\"A New Hope\\" walking around with Han Solo like a giant CG slug.  Ruined:  the celebration scene at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\": replaced the original Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker actors, who appear as ghostly apparitions, with those bozos from Episodes 1-3; then they do this tie-in with the Episodes 1-3, and remind you SMACK IN THE FACE about how bad Episodes 1-3 were, just when you were beginning to believe it was just bad nightmare.  So, you can't even enjoy the fact that the Rebels defeated the Empire.  I always just turn it off after Darth Vader dies, and cry myself to sleep.  They changed the music too.  In fact, the famous opening credits now go to the score of Austin Powers opening credits.  The scene in Empire, where Luke is captured by a snowman lost its lustre as soon as they decided to show you the cheesy white monster in this new edit.  Don't they remember scary movies are only scary when you can't see the bad guy?  In general, the excellent tie-fighter scenes are replaced with CG, whereas I'd rather see the originals.

1416596097|1.0|I was drawn to this book by the excellent reviews it received in the press, however, I was singularly unimpressed! I would not be an avid Le Carre fan although I have read some of his books in the past; this one was filled with more characters than was necessary, and all, including the three central protagonists, were stereo-typical and not very believable.   An author's job is to engage the reader in the lives of his characters, to stimulate emotions of love or hate for them, to be INTERESTED in them! But as I read this book, I did not care what happened to any of these three characters; although Le Carre WROTE that the characters had feelings for each other, no such emotions were apparent BETWEEN the lines, which is where a good writer communicates with the reader.   I felt that Le Carre was struggling to create a sense of tension or drama in places, but it just did not work; the writing was just plain turgid in places; the elaborate speech-making (explaining Dr Abdullah's background to the assorted spies and secret policemen) was very unconvincing; the conclusion was an action-packed scene, but this did not leap from the pages as it might have done with another writer.  To be fair, it started well, sagged in the middle, nonetheless, I stayed with it to the bitter end because I expected Le Carre would deliver towards the end, but it was all a bit disappointing.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Excellent, speedy service.  Gave this DVD as a gift and the feedback from the recipients was very positive.  Would highly recommend this seller.
0525423842|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It covers a wide range of topics for young adults when it comes to the law - things that adult readers and reviewers take for granted.  He seemlessly inserts into the story the different types of lawyers there are (criminal, tax, property, forclosure, divorce), how trials work, courtroom set-ups, that the prosecution has the burden of proof, circumstancial evidence, and many other legal concepts.  While adult readers may find this part redundant, young adults (who are new to the genre) have to start somewhere.  This book covers a lot of necessary legal knowledge to make this genre of books fun and exciting.  I am sure that future novels in the series will bypass a lot of these same concepts since Grisham will expect readers to have picked up on them in the first book in the series.  I also like how the murder was not one of blood and gore - making it more suitable for a younger audience.  I hope some junior high civic/social studies teachers seriously consider making this novel a part of their curriculum.  It teaches so much and is entertaining as well.
0307592839|3.0|This is a strangely disquieting novel that begins by introducing us to Sasha, who steals, due to her childhood experiences, and is now working as an assistant to Benny Salizar, a rising young record producer. Sasha and Benny know nothing of each other's pasts, but due to a series of flashbacks the reader learns everything, maybe too much, about them. We are taken to Naples, where the runaway Sasha is living among the city's dregs, and are introduced to the uncle who goes to Italy to try and save her, and in the process experiences an epiphany of sorts. We meet Benny as a young musician in San Francisco, during the heyday of the punk rock, acid cycle, then come upon him later as a disillusioned divorced man trying to establish contact with his young son. We meet their friends in the music world, some who succeed and many who fall by the wayside, and are witness to the self-destruction and unhappiness of many in the music world. Egan is a talented writer and quite brave to tackle the themes she does, but I can't say that I enjoyed this book.
B000LB7G00|1.0|Buyer beware! This is not a jog wheel, the device is a specific navigation device for 3D software and mostly windows-based apps. I bought it for final cut because I read somewhere (macworld) that it works with that application. I'm hoping to return it or it's a very expensive paper weight.
B004132HZS|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I've never read any Sherlock Holmes book, nor have I seen any of the classic films or TV series. My only true knowledge of the world of Holmes comes from general cultural references.<br /><br />Having said that, I REALLY loved this series. It's very witty, fast-paced, and enjoyable. The modern twist on this classic character is very easy to relate to. The BBC did a fantastic job casting both Holmes and Watson - the chemistry between the two is just too perfect. I first saw this series when it aired on PBS but instantly bought it and watched it a second time. It's funny and suspenseful at the same time. I cannot wait for the second series!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great video, still on level 1, the holidays got in the way! but once they are over and I'm more consistent in my workouts I can't wait to get to level 2 and 3. I like the fact that they workouts are only 20 minutes long, however they are very intense and you can feel it after each one.
B000002USN|1.0|This CD was advertised as being NEW. When received, the cover was all worn out, as it if it had been damaged by water, and the CD had been opened. It was not a brand NEW CD. The item's condition was misrepresented.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was quite taken aback by the movie....I am a Richard Gere fan through and through which is what drew me to this movie.  In the back of my mind I am thinking - a G movie, which after watching this one - there should be so much more.  I am an animal lover and found myself sobbing on the sofa with my puppy next to me.  The movie seemed slow at first without details but in the end - it was one of the best movies that I have seen in about ten years.  The heartwarming message that this movie brings epitomizes the word loyalty.  Rent or buy this movie - you won't be dissappointed.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I've been using my PS3 for about a year now. It came with one controller so it came to the day where I needed to buy a new one for guests. The controller works perfect, the battery lasts a good ammount of time and it is pretty easy to charge it. My downside for this is that it is very expensive.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|i really like afterlife its one of the better ones i did not care for #2 rest i like lot but this is on my top list of the resident evil movies i hope they keep going like this because this just keeps on getting better
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I LOVE this movie, and so do my children (ages 8 and 10).  It is very funny for everyone in the family boys, girls, young, old.  After I saw it in the theater I knew we just had to own it.  It is in my top ranking for great family movies.
1416550550|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about this book but then I got into it and stayed up after my husband went to bed to finish it.  Very complex characters and plot.  I would highly recommend this book.
B004AP09CU|1.0|I share some of the other reviewers' frustrations. This great (Darkness...) album was WAY overdue for a remastering but Sony/Columbia only provided a big price tag box set or mp3 download (which is inferior). The album and cd should ALWAYS be made affordably available and as a \\"stand-alone\\" product!!! Its not only tradition, but standard, customary practice; and, \\"good business sense\\"! It also shows respect and consideration for the consumer and Bruce fans. Its hard to believe that Bruce would allow this.
B004G8ZZHU|2.0|You're not missing much if you skip this movie. There is a minimal plot in this movie of double or triple cross among the villains and the A-Team got dragged into it. The rest of the movie is filled with big explosions, gun fights and aerial hijinks. Each team member gets a bit of character development, but blink and you might miss it.
B00275EHJG|3.0|Movie itself is great.  DVD stops in middle and has to be restarted and fast forwarded to where it stopped.  Something in DVD is bad.
