6305089957|5.0|In one scene of this movie, Randy has a debate with his film class about whether or not sequels could be good movies. Randy says no way. Well, I'm sorry Randy, but as much love as I have for you, you're wrong. This movie proves it.    Not surprisingly, murders start centering themselves again around Sydney. Is someone trying to repeat what happened in Woodsboro? New charactors in this film deliver much comic relief, Gail's photographer man and Mickey, a new friend of Sydney and Randy's opposing debater that sequels CAN rock. Hmm.     Don't be afriad to rent this movie. While not scary, it will deliever much needed laughs, and probably make you sad about a certain death....
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album is the ultimate speed metal experience.  Dont listen to anyone who says this is over rated or flawed in any way.  This is perfect from beginning to end.  not  a thing should be changed.  The album goes by quickly because music this extreme should not be long and drawn out.  A half hour onslaught is all  you need to get the picture and the message.  The message was and is Slayer can not be touched.  Any album that attempted to be faster than this sacrificed skill and form in doing so. No grindcore or deathmetal album comes close to matching slayers skill and artistic qualities, so dont try to mention another one.  This album has 2 songs that define it,  Angel of Death and the closer Raining Blood.   Everything in between is a lead up to the the dramatic finish.   And what a lead up it is, album starts by describing the most dramatic tale of the holocaust ever put to music, leaves you almost comatose, then proceeds to rip the flesh of your skin with thrash metal on amphetamine descriptions of satanism, butchery, serial killings, christian bashing, death and disease.   Then comes the masterpiece called Raining Blood.  This song is why Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King are the best guitar team in heavy metal.  Absolutely unbeatable classic guitar assault.   If you dont like this cd, either its to evil and over your head, or your not a fan of true speed metal. NObody has or ever will top this, not even slayer themselves.  This was not meant to be topped.   The pinnacle of heavy music.  NOt for the weak minded.....

B00007B8PF|5.0|Here we have the debut albumby AC/DC, HIGH VOLTAGE. It is not the same version as the one that was released internationally, that cd was acombination of this album and of TNT, both which are imports. Here we have 8 meaty tracks that we can sink are teeth into. From the very beginning, the band proved they could rock, and that they would be a force to reckon with in the coming years. You want tracks that rock, then I suggest you listen to:  SHE'S GOT BALLS, LITTLE LOVER, BABY PLEASE DONT GO, SHOW BUSINESS, SOUL STRIPPER. The only track I think is a little below the rest is STICK AROUND, its not a bad song, but it is just average compared to the others. You want a surprise, then I suggest you listen to LOVE SONG. Its an AC/DC power ballad long before these type of songs became the rage in the 80's. So recommend that you get you hands on this album any way you can. Dont waste you money on 74'JAILBREAK you can find 4 out of the 5 songs on the album here.
038572179X|1.0|Sorry, this was one of the slowest books I have ever read. I couldn't wait to finish it, which took forever.
0385504209|3.0|I heard about this book on a site that I trust.  It sounded intriguing and I had a 13 hour car ride ahead of me.  This Dan Brown novel sounded like the perfect way to pass the time.<br />It doesn't take long for the action to start happening.  Which I appreciated, but what was left behind was a good description of the characters involved.  This was something that plagued me through the book.  Mr. Brown brings a very creative concept to life by providing enough information about real life places and objects that kept me wanting to hop online and verify their existence.  I loved that aspect of the book.  I just never felt as though I really knew anything about the characters.  They were mere faceless players walking through their parts.  With the exception of the eccentric Sir Teabing, no one really stands out.<br />As with most mysteries or suspense books, I like to be given the chance to figure it out along with the protagonist.  Toss me a nugget of information every so often to help me out, but don't force it on me.  The morsels TDC gave were either to hard to figure out on your own or force feed so that even the slowest could see it coming.  There were numerous flashbacks to information throughout the book.  They were haphazardly placed and made it confusing as to the current action going on at times.<br />For as much as I may bash this book, I really did like it.  It was a great idea that just didn't play out well.  I think if it was ever a movie that it might have been a bit better because of the attention span of movie-goers who crave the action and intrigue.<br />It was an easy read and did just what I hoped it would do.  The 13 hour car ride passed by in no time.
B00005JJX8|4.0|TO CATCH A THIEF, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a lush and entertaining comedy/thriller concerning a jewel thief on the French Riviera. The films title was based upon an ancient proverb: Set a thief to catch a thief, with double meanings regarding a double chase. The hero, John Robie, a falsely-accused former cat burglar, has to find and catch the real cat burglar before he is caught himself, while the heroine, Frances Stevens, is on a quest to catch him--first as a burglar and then as a husband. Each wishes To Catch a Thief.<br />Unlike most of Hitchcocks work, this thriller is very low-key and based around a small mystery. As time passes, the audience realizes there is more afoot to this game than at first meets the eye. Does Frances have more malicious intent in trailing Robies every move, or is her quest purely husband-oriented? The robberies are all in his particular style; could our hero be lying? When an investigation winds up in murder, and Robie is blamed by Francis for the theft of her priceless family jewels, Robie must defy death and attempt to grasp some sense of the truth, before he loses everything. At times, you are not quite<BR>certain who everyone truly is. They are playing two-sides of a chess game; much like NOTORIOUS. Can you trust them or do they have something sinister up their sleeves?<br />Spread throughout the dialogue are sensationally clever double entendres that although made in a light manner, still overshadow a deeper meaning. They come fast and furious throughout most of the film. Its all done in a knowing, cheeky fashion, which was rendered to placate the overzealous Production Code Administration as much as it was to remind the audience that, in the end, this is all in good fun. <br />One of the few good points about the old Hollywood Production Code was the creative dialogue it caused writers to come up with in order to get their points across; which is also why the fireworks/kiss scene is still effective. Its a wonder the dialogue passed through the censors without a murmur. Obviously, filmmakers were now doing everything in their power to subvert the code--albeit in a friendly, comedic manner. I believe if this film had been played more seriously and didnt have such a light and comictone, most of the dialogue would not have passed through the code. Lucky for us, it did.
B000093BDX|4.0|The Beach Boys got such massive airplay in their heyday it got quite monotonous listening to them, however, it's time to revisit them with this really good recording. The mono/stereo mixes are slightly irritating but nothing to worry about. The selections are culled from different albums and even different labels. On my copy, 'I Get Around' loses high frequency in the closing chorus also some selections are cut quite suddenly in fadeout. An added plus for me was 'Sloop John B'. Over 70 minutes of good summer music especially on your car stereo.
B00005JLYU|4.0|There was no question that the extremely popular, highly profitable 2000 film version of the TV series,Charlie's Angels, would have a sequel. And now, here it is, with the three beautful and talented ladies returning to their roles. This time, they are joined by 'original' angel Kelly Garett, played by Jaclyn Smith, and 'fallen' angel Madison Lee, played by a beautifully remade Demi Moore. Clever cameos add to the excitement, making this installment as good as the first.<br />These angels get to kick...in sexy clothes and stiletto heels. They get to run in slow motion as highly flammable stuff explodes behind them. They get to save the day and look fabulous doing it. And all the while, in true girl-power movie fashion, they stay true to each other. Sure, things get a little ridiculous sometimes, but it's all extremely entertaining and so much fun. <br />In the opening sequence, for example, after effortlessly fighting off a room full of angry Mongolians, they plunge off a bridge in an armored truck to what should be their fiery death. But angels Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are so plucky, so resourceful, so gosh-darned indefatigable, they just hop onto a helicopter - which happened to be inside the armored truck - and fly away to safety. \\"I'm afraid I underestimated you guys,\\" a U.S. marshal they've rescued (played by Robert Patrick) remarks afterward. \\"Yeah,\\" perky Natalie replies, her blinding grin seemingly taking up her entire face. \\"That happens a lot.\\" Maybe our heroines get shortchanged in the plot and dialogue departments - but as was the case with the '70s TV show the movie is based on, those things don't really matter, do they? That's not what you came to see. <br />The \\"Charlie's Angels\\" movies are all about having an unabashedly campy good time - and this is where a music-video background comes in handy for director McG, who made his feature-film debut with the original. \\"Full Throttle\\" is bigger, better, faster andmore fun than the first - self-aware without being too cutesy, savvy without being tragically hip. It's a great addition to the long line of summer sequels. And wow, those outfits!
B000099T2L|3.0|Ive always been a Destinys Child fan, and Ive been looking foward Beyonces solo debut for so long. I can say that this album is better than I thought, at first I was expecting more Independent Woman, Bootylicious, Survivor type of songs with great vocals but whack lyrics. But Dangerously in Love is not this type of album. Beyonces grown up and her songwritting skills have improved. She shows her talent in songs like &quot;Be With You&quot; (nice vocals &amp; catchy hook for a slow song), &quot;Yes&quot; (my favorite song of the album, talks about how a guy dont wanna wait to take the next step and is tryin to rush her), Speechless&quot; (beautiful ballad about making love), &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; (yall already listened to that one in the radio) and &quot;The Closer I get to You&quot; (duet with Luther Vandross).<BR>The reason why I dont give 5 stars to the album is because after all this waiting, (shes been working on this album over a year) it seems like this album was done in a hurry. I expected so much more of songs like &quot;Baby Boy&quot; feat. Sean Paul, it seems like it was done in one day to finish the album quickly, the same happens with &quot;Thats how you like it&quot; and &quot;Hip-Hop Star&quot; this tow songs shouldnt be in the album. <BR>I still like this album is better and more matture that I thought but its weak at some points.
B000084T18|2.0|Honestly, I like 50 Cent as a rapper; he has a certain honesty to him that is lacking in most rappers today. When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects.

B0000027RL|3.0|I have just heard this album.  Yes it is a great album- if you buy it you will not be dissapointed.   However, i prefer other albums.  My favourite song is Even flow, it has a great chorus and some great guitar riffs.  The rest i could take them or leave them- nothing that special.<br />Nirvana :  Nevermind  :  Brilliant album - every song a gem<BR>The clash: The clash,London's Calling:  For that pure punk sound
B00007B8PF|4.0|Peter Kent pretty much did a good job summing this album up. It was great to finally get the original High Voltage on CD. This one used to be much harder to procure in the U.S., but now it is available due to a larger mass printing by Festival Mushroom Records.
B00005JM09|3.0|\\"Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines\\" is really one of those movies that didn't have to be made. That saying alot from a person that who really loved the first two movies. This was a movie that had problems from the beginning. Both James Cameron and Linda Hamilton both passed on working movie. The actress that played Kate Brewster was replaced by Claire Danes after two days of filming. And Edward Furlong who played John Conner was not in the movie either.<br />The actual storyline seemed like a rehash of Terminator 2. If they wanted to make it interesting they should have picked the movie up after Judgement Day and show the humans trying fight back against the machines.<br />Over all, unless you a big fan of the movies or Arnold you just might want to wait till it comes DVD.
B00005QGAT|5.0|We all damn well know that Michael Jackson re-mastered his best albums for the sake of making some extra cash and perhaps to remind folks of his pre-Wacko Jacko days. With that said, I can't help but listen to this album and miss the young, hungry, energetic Michael Jackson that came of this project.<br />Originally released back in 1979, &quot;Off The Wall&quot; was and still is straight up fun times. &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Rock With You&quot; are timeless dance floor classics, while &quot;Workin' Day and Night&quot; and &quot;Get On The Floor&quot; had hit single potential written all over them. The title track is creepy good times. &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, written by McCartney, is nice and innocent, while &quot;She's Out of My Life&quot; is Michael's ultimate tearjerker. &quot;It's The Falling In Love&quot; slowly builds up on you. Michael ends things on a high with &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot;, which sounds a lot like his previous hit with the Jacksons, &quot;Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)&quot;, lyrically.<br />Aside from interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton, the bonus goodies give you an interesting prospective into the making of the album: &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Workin' Day and Night&quot; (home demos by Michael). You get to hear the songs in their beginning stages of birth, and it's pretty neat.<br />&quot;Off The Wall&quot; remains Michael Jackson first feel-good classic R&amp;B album. Forget what most people say about him now, this is how Michael Jackson should always be remembered.
B00006BTCA|4.0|After hearing the first single &quot;Obstacle One&quot;, I almost got hooked on their melancholy sound. Pretty much a break from your ordinary mellow rock band. Definitely not quite Radiohead or Coldplay, but still not bad. For only ten bucks, you should GET IT! IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!
B000069AUI|2.0|My friend who usually has good taste, recommeded this CD to me, and I really had no idea what it was going to be like except mellow. I like some mellow, U2 is okay. I put in this CD and I was so BORED. Sorry. Every song sounded the same and didn't stir any emotion in me. I gave the cd to a co-worker, big mistake because apparently she loves it and plays it over and over again, which adds to my hatred of this wretched cd.. Go buy American Life,,, much better.. or some Johnny Cash...
0375414053|4.0|Kate Reddy is a successful fund manager, married with two kids. But between her hectic work schedule, her children's needs at school and at home, and her husband, can she maintain her pre-motherhood life style? <br />Such is the premise of this novel written in a voice similar to that of Bridget Jones's Diary. Allison Pearson gives us a peek into the life of this frantic woman, trying to do everything, and be everything to everybody. Contrary to Diary, however, this book does present certain issues, albeit in a rather humorous manner, relating to parenthood and careerism.  For example, while the main character wants to stay on her career path, her coworkers don't seem to understand when she has to leave early to pick up the kids. In contrast, when one of her male coworkers leaves early to attend a school function, they all seem to ooh and ahh in admiration of his dedication to his family.<br />What I found very funny in this book is the competition between the stay-at-home mothers and the working mothers.  As the working mothers try to be as \\"perfect\\" as the stay-at-home ones (described as being disciples of Martha Stewart), trying to outdo them at all school functions, they just seem to get more and more frazzled as they realise they just don't have as much time on their hands to prepare home baked goodies and such.<BR>  <BR>Readers will enjoy reading about this poor woman trying her best to do it all. I was a little surprised with the choices she makes in the end. I might have preferred a slightly different outcome, however. This is a fun book, a quick, light read, perfect for a summer afternoon.
B00005JKYI|5.0|Ah......... those small, Midwestern towns. One bad accident, and the entire town looks for someone, or something, to blame. In this case, they blamed dancing and rock &amp; roll music. As a result, they outlawed both. For those of us who can't dance a lick or keep a tune to save our lives, this might be a pretty good place to live in. But for Ren (Kevin Bacon), he's just arrived in a town that will always seem like Friday the 13th to him.<br />Ren and his mom have just moved to this small town from the big city of Chicago. Naturally, Ren is a fish out of water here. Everytime there's trouble, people start pointing at him, whether it was his fault or not.<br />But don't feel too bad for Ren. He has made some friends in his High School, but he's also ticked off a few too. And his plan to have a Senior Prom (an event that has not happened in this town for 6 years) is threatening to divide the town in half.<br />Many people will not like this movie for the sole reason of the 80s music and dance. But there is a story behind the music, one that was brilliantly told. I have seen this movie many, many times, and each time I watch it I catch something that I had missed before. This was not a teen movie made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the teen movie craze at the time. It has a message worth listening to.<br />Unfortunatley, the DVD is lacking in extras. Of course, this movie was made back when DVDs were nothing more than an idea in somebody's head. Still, considering the popularity both then and now that this movie has enjoyed, it would have been nice to get the cast back together and produced something new to offer us.
B000084T18|3.0|Early in 2003, 50 cent realesed one of the most anticipated albums in the history of Hip-Hop \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\". I bumped this album for about 3 straight months before taking it out of the CD changer. Over the summer, marked with a new appreciation for rap,I listened to this album, only to be disapointed. Though the album has very good beats, 50's rhymes are not great, (though I do think he is getting better after hearing some recent guest appearences) the best verses on this album are owned by Eminem on \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Don't Push Me\\". Along with Eminem's guest appearences, the best songs on the album are \\"In Da Club\\" (one of the best hip-hop party jams ever, yea ever), and \\"Heat\\", which has a nice beat delievered by one of the best Dr. Dre. Lyrically overall this album is not great, but riding on it's beats, it earns a 3/3.5 rating. Hopefully 50's follow up will be better.
B00005QXDD|3.0|You see these guys on TV and they're funny and musical with just two acoustic guitars. Play this CD and suddenly you're in a freshman frat party. And come on! F*** cannot simultaneously be the funniest word in the world and the ultimate obscenity. It's one or the other. And of 21 tracks you've got, what? 6 songs? What we need is for Jack to believe that the abscence of obscenity and vulgarity does not necessarily produce boredom. Unless, that's all he's got?
0788821075|4.0|Pretty Woman (1990) Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Ralph Bellamy, Jason Alexander, Laura San Giacomo, Hector Elizondo, Alex-Hyde White, Amy Yasbeck, Larry Miller, D: Garry Marshall. By surprise, this romantic-comedy working from an outdated love formula comes out successful:  a suave, solitary businessman and eligible bachelor (Gere) staying in Beverly Hills picks up a Hollywood Boulevard hooker (Roberts) and asks her to accompany him for a week, where he spruces her into a pretty woman and pays her $3,000-what she doesn't expect is to have feelings for him by the end of her stay. Utterly entertaining, charming, and heartfelt Cinderella story (without being sleazy apropos prostitution), and still popular after its release, with a delightful Roberts in a role that built her as a star.
B00005JM09|5.0|I had seen a review of it in the newspaper that said it didn't measure up.  This is not true, it is a worthy successor to the first two in the series.  It is not merely a 3rd installment designed to make the studios money, but one that furthers the story.  <br />Go see the movie.
0792838068|5.0|I have never written a review for amazon.com before, but I was so touched by this film that I thought I could share my thoughts with others. I have seen numerous movies in my life that have story lines about love. Unlike other films,though, this one doesn't try to manipulate the viewer's feelings. The honesty in this dark movie is what makes it soar above any other film. <BR>These characters aren't people you envy or admire; they are just lost souls who are simply looking for love and acceptance. This film effortlessly makes you care so much for the characters because it presents them as flawed human beings who want nothing more than to feel love and to give love. This movie is touched me so deeply because it was a visual representation of feelings of my own life when I am forced to drop my guard and examine my own life and person I truly am. Please, don't even bother reading anymore reviews because this movie will brings tears to your eyes as a result of its unwillingness to give into the boring cliches and stereotypes that ruin so many other movies. If you can handle thinking outside of the box, you will be deeply rewarded
B00000099Y|5.0|OK... I own all of Tool's CD and my CD collection is around 1000cds, it holds all kinda of music from rap,rnb,rock,punk,hip-hop,grunge,metal,alternative,hindi,jazz and so on.

0553213105|5.0|After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!
B00005O5CM|3.0|Legally Blonde (2001) Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, Ali Larter, Michael Jeter, Jessica Cauffiel, Oz Perkins, Jennifer Collidge, Bruce Thomas, Raquel Welch, D: Robert Luketic. Witherspoon is an utter enjoyment as \\"Beverly Hills Barbie\\"-a perky sorority airhead who gets dumped by her wiser boyfriend, and in order to win him back she decides to enter Harvard Law School (with her little pet Chihuahua). The actress holds it all her own as a smart cookie in this fish-out-of-water comedy that's weightless as a feather but surprises us with some laughs. Based on the novel by Amanda Brown. Followed by a sequel. Running Time: 96 minutes and rated PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
B00008G9JN|5.0|_Songs From The Wood_ and _Heavy Horses_ are not only two of my favorite Tull albums but two of my favorite albums by anyone, ever. I've had SftW in one form or another since it was released in 1977 and I know every note on it forward, backward, upside down, and inside out. I was _expecting_ to be blown away by the remastered version.<br />And for all that, even _I_ wasn't prepared for the full effect of this thing. My heavens, there's a wealth of sonic detail here that I haven't heard in twenty-five years, and it's every bit as fresh as when it first came out. It brought tears to my eyes.<br />This will not be a big deal to you if this isn't one of your Preferred Tulls. But if it is . . . well, then, you can safely ignore the silly comments from the peanut gallery and rest assured that this remastered release is worth investing in.<br />As with most of these Tull re-releases, I don't care one way or another about the extra tracks. It's nice to have &quot;Beltane&quot; (which was released on the big 20-year box set but got winnowed out of the one-CD version). It's also nice to have a live &quot;Velvet Green&quot;. But I'd have bought this CD without them. (Not that I'm complaining. And anyway, if you don't want to hear the extra tracks, you can just stop the CD, can't you? Like most CDs, this one has a nice generous break before the &quot;bonus&quot; tracks kick in so that you can do just that.)<br />And I don't have anything to say about the album itself that I didn't say in my review of the earlier CD version. It's just that in view of some of the reviews this remastered version has been getting, I thought some potential buyers might like to hear from someone who _liked_ the blinkin' thing in the first place and can therefore comment sensibly on whether this new release is satisfactory.<br />It is.
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild is ostensibly about Christopher McCandless, a young man who set off alone on a transcontinental trek in 1992 and whose decomposing body was found in the Alaskan wilderness four months later. But Krakauer's book is less an account of how McCandless died than an intimate exploration of how he sought to live.<br />Through Krakauer's post-mortem investigation and interviews with McCandless's family, friends, and acquaintances he encountered in his journey, we come to know a man who was intelligent, passionate, and utterly dissatisfied with the trappings of 20th Century America. McCandless cast off  his successes and material burdens to seek out a more primal affirmation of what it means to be alive, to be a creature of the Earth and of the earth. Echoes of Thoreau are inevitable and are peppered throughout Krakauer's account, but he refrains from lapses into romanticism and does not shy from pointing out McCandless's ignorance and errors of judgement. But neither does he suggest, as some did, that McCandless's seeming recklessness betrayed a death wish; rather we see a young man so entranced by the siren call of the pure and simple life that he approached the hazards that adorned his path with myopic disregard. Krakauer detours periodically from his narrative examination of McCandless's last days to tell of others, including the author himself, who like McCandless sought for even one brief moment to truly live, believing that one sweet memory would forever change their perspective on existence.<br />In the end, Krakauer resists the temptation to provide a facile explanation for McCandless's actions. The reader can decide for him/herself whether McCandless was a bold adventurer, a misguided boy, or a brash fool. Whatever the ultimate opinion, one is left with, if not respect, at least a measure of understanding and possibly envy at McCandless determination to seek out and truly live life--convention, convenience, and rationality be damned.
0743216458|5.0|One of America's greatest strengths has been, and is, its citizen soldiers - the ones called upon in time of military crisis to defend and defeat, who do the job, and then return to their private lives. BAND OF BROTHERS is a tribute to these individuals in general and, in particular, to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.<br />The book begins with Company E's formation in July 1942, and ends with its inactivation on November 30, 1945. It's a narrative history based on letters, diaries, news clippings and personal interviews. It spans the company's training in the United States and England, its combat roles in the D-Day invasion, the subsequent Operation Market Garden, and the defense of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and ends with the capture of Hitler's Alpine retreat, Berchtesgaden, and the last months as an occupying force in Austria. There's a stark contrast between Company E's sojourn in the Hell of battle and its occupation duty, the latter characterized by author Stephen Ambrose as a &quot;soldier's dream life&quot; of &quot;mountain weather, unlimited sports, women and booze, easy duty, (and) good hunting&quot;.<br />Company E's full complement was 140 men - 8 officers and 132 enlisted. But, as casualties mounted, original members were replaced with new, and the cast of characters is large. At times, BAND OF BROTHERS is more a series of vividly drawn vignettes featuring named individuals in the context of a particular combat operation. The reader never really gets to &quot;know&quot; any one soldier, with the exception of perhaps Dick Winters, who provides a continuity of sorts. Winters began as a 2nd Lieutenant commanding a platoon, and ended the war as a Major commanding the 2nd Battalion. To the degree that the author allows, Winters is the foremost hero of a group of heroes, i.e. all of E Company. The reader is thus forced to identify with the unit as a whole throughout its travails and final triumph. This was the author's intent, and is the book's ultimate strength. In the paperback edition, there are only eight pages of photographs and two of maps. One wishes for more. The last chapter on post-war careers is a nice, and logically necessary, touch.<br />Most war-centered works of non-fiction focus on the &quot;great commanders&quot; - Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Nelson, Washington, Lee, Grant, Rommel, Montgomery, Eisenhower, Patton, MacArthur, etc. BAND OF BROTHERS is the best book I can recall on the experiences of the common soldier - the guy in the front trench whose only reward at the end of hostilities, if he lives, is a wound or two, a souvenir enemy pistol or flag, and the greatest of all, a feeling of comradeship with his fellows that lasts for life. This last almost makes war seem worth it.<br />Currahee!iumph. This was the author's intent, and is the book's ultimate strength.

0441172717|5.0|If you even claim to like Sci-Fi literature and yet haven't read this, you have some ways to go. This book did for science fiction what Lord of the Rings did for fantasy. It showed the heights to which writers could attain in the genre. Dune continues to draw readers with a freshness unmatched for being written in the 60's. Mostly action and intrigue and no boring parts. The characters are wonderful(you'll even like the scum-of-the-earth villans). This book was so good that I had to get the rest of the books in the six part series. If you are even interested in sci-fi literature, I say, &quot;Get it! Get it now!&quot;
078401213X|4.0|synchronicity is reality, not just a movie, or actually just a movie, the movie you are in just now is a mirror of the movie in your brain, stopping the movie is asking for a headache, the matrix will not like it if you deny the option of the red or blue pill and choose the drill instead, but like all the shamans throughout the 100,000 years of human mental evolution, you must submit to the kundalini forcibly rewiring your brain, and if a mistake is made and you suffer for the rest of your life, then too bad for you, evolution blindly marches on, the best advice for those seeking the illumination of the holy spirit is dont fight it and dont force it.  that is what this movie is about.
0312305060|5.0|This is the perfect book for  lovers of Contemporary fiction.<br />A very deep and moving book with complex characters and situations, all of which the reader will be able to relate to in some form.<br />Mr. Cunningham  introduces us to the main characters in the book who are three women living in three different centuries. Virginia Woolfe, Karen Brown and Clarissa Dolloway's stories intertwine in such a smart unbelievable pattern that by the time you reach the end of the novel you will be opened-mouthed in wonderment and surprise.<br />Virginia is a writer in the 1920's, suffering from a mental imbalance and putting together a book entitled:-  Ms. Dolloway. Laura Brown is a Los Angeles  housewife in the 1950's....a post World War 2 bride suffocating in her role as the good housewife and mother as she attempts to bake a cake for her husband's birthday that day.  Clarissa Dolloway in the year 2002 is acting as hostess by planning a party for her ex lover who is dying with Aids and is about to receive one of the biggest Literary prizes for his latest work.<br />Michael Cunningham latest accomplishment is laced with emotion. Rooted in these pages are emotions of despair, anguish, low self esteem, and suicidal thoughts amongst others. But little by little the reader will come to love all of those characters, and empathise with them  for after all they are very much everyday people like you and me.<br />A wonderful piece! A kaleidoscopic tale! A five star rating!
B00006CXSS|5.0|BAND OF BROTHERS is categorically the best TV miniseries ever created, surpassing my previous pick, LONESOME DOVE.<br />This 10-hour/10-episode epic was a labor of love produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the latter the lead in perhaps the finest combat drama ever made for the Big Screen, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br />Based on the non-fiction book by Stephan Ambrose, BAND OF BROTHERS is a visual tribute to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Its timespan is a little more than 3 years, from the summer of 1942 to the late fall of 1945. It depicts the company's training in the United States and England, its combat roles in the D-Day invasion, the subsequent Operation Market Garden, and the defense of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and ends with the capture of Hitler's Alpine retreat, Berchtesgaden, and the occupation of a scenic Austrian lake valley.<br />There aren't enough superlatives to describe the acting, period costuming and weaponry, cinematography, and sets. It's a masterpiece of cinema verite. The actors are virtual unknowns. Perhaps this is inescapable in a script calling for the rapid turnover of personalities. Company E's full complement was 140 men - 8 officers and 132 enlisted. But, as casualties mounted, original members were replaced with new, and the cast of characters is large. The viewer never really gets to &quot;know&quot; any one soldier, with the exception of perhaps Dick Winters (Damian Lewis), who provides a continuity of sorts. Winters began as a 2nd Lieutenant commanding a platoon, and ended the war as a Major commanding the 2nd Battalion. To the degree that the storyline allows, Winters is the foremost hero in a group of heroes, i.e. all of E Company. The viewer is thus forced to identify with the unit as a whole throughout its travails and final triumph. And Lewis, a Brit who manages to lose his accent for the role, is perfect. Ron Livingston as Lewis Nixon, Winter's good friend and alcoholic but competent battalion staff officer, provides an additional thread of continuity from beginning to end.<br />Those who've both read the book and seen the miniseries will notice differences. Some events are shown in a different sequence, as when one of the Company E troopers is killed by a freak accident with a souvenir Luger pistol. More noticeably, an entire episode is more or less devoted to the heroics of a company medic during the defense of Bastogne, while another focuses on the unit's discovery of a Nazi enslavement camp. Both subjects are given but scant paragraphs in the original book.<br />The DVD also includes a bonus track on the nuts and bolts of the production. I watched this feature after the miniseries, and was amazed to learn that the forest setting for the defense of Bastogne episode, one of the best, was an indoor creation, snow and all!<br />I saw the ten episodes over a couple of weeks. Perhaps a better way to do it is have all your male pals over for a one-day viewing marathon to include pizza and beer (or C-rations and canteen water in an olfactory ambience of gun oil, blood, stale sweat, exploded earth, and open latrine trenches). Oh, did I mention that this is a Guy Flick? It's about young males bonding, jumping out of airplanes, fighting, killing, getting maimed and killed, and enjoying the fruits of victory (booze, women and looting). There's no female role of significance, and no love interest. It's Warrior Life at its best and worst.nd and alcoholic but competent battalion staff officer, provides an additional thread of continuity from beginning to end.<br />Those who've both read the book and seen the miniseries will notice differences.

0345340426|5.0|But you should already know that. Now some parts are slow but believe me it picks up. By the time you get to Return of the King, you'll really get into the characters and story and you'll want more. Don't fool yourself if you think you can get into the Fantasy genre without reading this. It's essential because the creativity put into Middle-Earth and the characters inspired MANY other fantasy writers and makes the genre what it is today. Without this book I doubt we would have as many fantasy writers today as we do. Really really really (three for emphasis) recommended!
B00005JLK1|4.0|Wow. I was surprised at the hostile reviews this movie has seen. Being an afficiando of horror flicks, from old school to new, I watched Ghost Ship at the recommendation of a friend. While it isn't the scream a minute slicer-dicer, or a brooding Hitchcockian thriller, this film did surprise me in a lot of good ways. The plot twists veered one way and then another, and everything came together quite nicely. The effects were incredible, especially given the low-key way they were presented. The actors played their roles well, rather than simply being actors walking in and saying lines without attempting to sink into the characters.<br />While there were cliches, they were forgiveable in the overall scheme of things. While it's not quite a thinker, or a screamer, it is a chilly movie to watch, and will make you think twice about taking a cruise.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Really a great new singer, with lyrics you can identify with (though just a bit fuzzy), and superb guitar playing, extremly talented.<BR>In his major label debut, he is joined by a full backup band, which I found took away from his unplugged charm, though others may find it more powerfull.<BR>One Thing he did, which I found cute, was skip the 13th track, for he believes it brings bad luck...
0385504209|4.0|Mr. Brown's book is a high paced action mystery thriller.  It is obviously written for mass market digestion, as he uses effusive foreshadowing that allows the reader to figure out the solutions to the plots and subplots well in advance of Brown revealing them.  However, the book is great fun to read.<br />When evaluating detective/mystery books, I always try to compare them to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books, which really are the only books in this genre that I feel are truly literature in the classic sense.  Brown's book does not live up to that literary test, but it does live up to most other tests of what readers would consider a good read.<br />If you enjoy page turning mystery with a theological theme, this is truly a wonderful read.
B00006ALGL|1.0|The introspective singer songwriter has become nearly as common as the studio born popstar. So, it takes more than a few thoughtful lyrics, the ability to carry a tune and a sparsely strummed guitar to impress my ears.<br />Rice's voice seems pleasant if not sweet at the onset, but midway through the album his often keening vocals grate on the nerves. The songwriting suffers from an overbearing sincerity and dirge like quality at times. The female vocalist and strings add to the overblown affair, creating a &quot;give me a break&quot; reaction, rather than the impassioned heart pull it strives to be.
B000002BPS|5.0|1st of all, anyone who says this is a bad album, a disapointing album, that it could've been better or any other related nonsense can stick it up their arse. This is a masterpiece. I picked it up about 6 months ago (to be honest the reason was because I liked the cover). As soon as I got back to my Dad's house, I put the CD on and the 1st thing that came to my mind was \\"it's got some cool songs but it's not as good as smash\\"...how wrong I was. A few weeks later I decided to listen to it again, as if to give it a 2nd chance. I was blown away, I realized that this was a masterpiece, and the offspring's best album (smash now comes in at 2nd, conspiracy of 1 is 3rd, Americana is 4th, Ignition is only just beaten to 4th- coming in at 5th, and the debut comes in at 6th, sorry guys but the lyrics are pretty stupid, beheaded maked me laugh though).<br /> Anyway, now onto the content:<br />1-disclaimer: A perfect introduction, which is hylarious upon 1st listen, and still make me chuckle. It's not a proper song but I'll give it 9/10<br />2-the meaning of life: great song to sing along to, and the lyrics are funny yet serious and meaningful all at once, the guitar riffs in this are pretty cool too. 9/10<br />3-mota: a song about drug abuse (not a good topic) but I can't deny that it's a good song. It opens up with a marching drum beat, and is then joined by guitars after the band proclaim \\"MOTA!\\" 8/10<br />4-me and my old lady: I'd have to say that this is probably my least favourite song, but that doesn't nessisarily mean it sucks, it's still a good song. It's rather experimental, and it's not something I'd expect to hear from the offspring. 8/10<br />5-cool to hate: my favourite song on the album, about hating everyone and everything (again, not a nice topic, but that song kicks arse). 10/10<br />6-leave it behind: about holding a grudge, really cool song, and I like the tempo transitions. 10/10<br />7-gone away: this is an amazing song, but it's also slightly depressing, you can really feel the pain when listening to this song. 10/10<br />8-I choose: This is the kinda song that you can listen to and just feel good, funny lyrics and cool guitars. 10/10<br />9-intermission: OK, I said me and my old lady was my least favourite song, but this is worse, it's kinda funny the 1st time, but it's really just filler. 5/10<br />10-All I want: another classic, fast paced and energetic, that's all I need to say. 10/10<br />11-way down the line: great song about growing up and become exact replicas of your parents. 10/10<br />12-don't pick it up: short, funny song about not taking chances with risky things. 9/10<br />13-amazed: I'm not really sure how to describe this song, but it's slightly slow, with a sad presence. 10/10<br />14-change the world: cool song that's bassically about selfish liars. 10/10<br />overall: 129/140<br />I'd recomend this to anyone who likes the offspring. And if you're going out to buy your 1st offspring album, this should be the one. I'd also recomend this to any punk fans, and anyone who likes fast paced music,as well as rock fans and even metal and alternative fans.<br />P.S: I am not a huge punk fan, but the offspring are one of the best punk bands, no, one of the best bands, out there.<br />have a nice day
6300214419|5.0|Someone said in their review that he/she didn't know if Streep was still with her husband at the end, and called this film''TRIPE'' because of it, and because of it having been left to our own imagination [paraphrasing]....  <br />Don't blame a FILM just because YOU aren't paying attention.  Her girlfriend [Weist], while walking down the street with Streep at the end, very deliberately suggested to Streep about fixing her up with someone, or her possibly finding someone at a function, and the way the scene went, that friend's attempts and concerns of finding a new mate for her was played to appear to be going on for a long time.... because she is obviously alone/single again at the end of the film!<br />I watched this film years ago, taped it on a blank with all of Streeps other films consecutively on blanks, and had to own it in it's cover.  There isn't a single thing anyone can pick at in this beauty .....it is FLAWLESS, and one of the greatest of a simple little love story...  EVER MADE!  ....We've all been there [those of us fortunate enough to have had such a love].
0316666343|5.0|Wow... I just got done with The Lovely Bones a few hours ago, and I must say I was quite pleased. I read the whole book in one sitting, and I was never disapointed with how the story was going. It really pulls at your emotions, and I often found myself thinking what I would do, and how I would feel in her position. The pain... the agony that her family went through - and the longing for home Suzie felt. It was really heart rending.<br />Many would say that this novel is extremely disturbing, but I found it bearable... it wasn't that grusome at all. Although, I am exposed to things like this on a timely basis (I work in a hospital). I think this is a must read. It has made me wonder about how &quot;my&quot; Heaven would be, and if I would ever stop watching the goings on &quot;down on earth&quot;.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I enjoyed this CD.  Actually this was my first Radiohead CD I bought, and prior to Hail to the Theft, I knew little about this New Wave Band.  When I first listened to 2+2=5, I thought this new unique style was kinda lame, but after going through and hearing songs such as sail to the moon and other mystical songs using this techno beat adapted in Kid A, and mellow alternative beat such as OK Computer, I found myself on a mystical path! To relax with Radiohead on is a privledge.  I highly recomend this CD for anyone who is interested in Radiohead, because it offers all their unique stlyes in one CD!
B00006879E|5.0|I got this album because the song &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; hooked me. To tell you the truth it was not at all what I expected, but it was a pleasant surprise to say the least. Every song is great, and the lyrics are smartly written.<br />1. Harder to Breathe-(5/5)- I love this song, cuz it's what made me get the album. The powerful guitar strings, and unique vocals, mixed with great lyrics equal a hit.<br />2. This Love-(4.5/5)- This song has a great beat, and the opening to the song made me want to listen on. It's chorus is pretty catchy too.<br />3. Shiver-(4/5)- I really like this song as well, because it has an awesome sound to it. The lyrics are catchy, especially the chorus, and it just sounds excellent.<br />4. She Will Be Loved-(5/5)- This is my favorite off the album, along with Harder to Breathe, because it's a smartly written, beautiful song. The music is heart-melting and I love the lyrics, especially the chorus.<br />5. Tangled-(3.5/5)- I love the music, the guitar chords, and all. The lyrics are totally relatable, but it's just not a stand out track to me.<br />6. The Sun-(3/5)-This is my least favorite song off the album, because it has a slow, melancholy tone that just wasn't for me.<br />7. Must Get Out-(5/5)- This is another one of my favorites. The lyrics are well said, and the music is mellow. I love the chorus. &quot;I'm lifting you up, I'm letting you down, I'm dancing til dawn, I'm fooling around, I'm not giving up, I'm making your love, this city's made us crazy and we must get out&quot;- Must Get Out, Maroon 5.<br />8. Sunday Morning-(4.5/5)- The music is a bit boring at first, but it has sort of a lounge, relaxing feel to it. If it wasn't for the lyrics I wouldn't be a big fan of the song, but it is great.<br />9. Secret-(3.5/5)- This song is slower paced, with kind of an eastern vibe, but I like it. <br />10. Through With You-(4.5/5)- This song has a great beat, and the lyrics sound great, and I love the feel of the song.<br />11. NotComing Home-(4.5/5)- I find this song very similar to Through With You, which is kind of filler after Through With You, but I like the song.<br />12. Sweetest Goodbye-(5/5)- This is a great way to end the album, and it makes you want more, it is a very sweet song.<br />Overall, this is a great buy, and it'll be in my CD player for a while. I can't wait for their next one!
B00006F7S4|5.0|It is true that this CD is both dreary and slightly depressing. contrary what most of the reviews have stated, however, there are tinges of hope and epiphany in most of the songs. after listening to songs like paper tiger, sunday sun, and round the bed- you feel a sense of contentment. its a bizarre feeling, but all the songs are very satisfying and reassuring. i give my highest recommendation to anyone who appreciates well crafted and heartfelt music. this is despite the fact that i dont consider myself a huge Beck fan. so just get it.
B000001DYD|4.0|PJ Harvey's 2nd disc is astonishing, but not an easy listen.  Harvey's very effective three-piece works its way through hard thrash, obsessive mania, atonal experimantation, the '60s (a masterful cover of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;) and gorgeous ballads (&quot;Missed&quot;). <br />Harvey is the truest bluesman around these days.  Her songs appear, as do Kafka's stories and the lyrics of Robert Johnson, as iamges directly from the unconscious.  While this is a druggy heavy rock record, Harvey obliquely recalls Hank Williams and Patsy Cline emotional searchign and spare soundscapes.  Often eschewing conventional song structures, Harvey works one-riff obsessive meditations on desire into furious and eerie rants.  She becomes the Virgin Mary, wondering at the miracle of Jesus' birth, in &quot;Missed.&quot;  In &quot;Rid of Me&quot; she fights, with the horrible insistence of a nightmare, with somebody who is by turns herself and an un-named lover.<br />Harvey's band is tight, yet swings with druggy conviction, and Albini's carefully layered abrasive sound hides some real aural suprises.  <br />This album is one of the masterpieces of female songwriting.  It stands with Patti Smith's &quot;Horses,&quot; Joni Mitchell's &quot;Blue&quot;, Laurie Anderson's &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot; and the high points of Patsy Cline's work (especially the mesmerising &quot;Walking After Midnight.&quot;).  <br />Her subsequent work has been disappointing.  I can't help shake the feelign that Harvey needs to get back to basics, but RID OF ME is a masterpiece.

B00008H2LB|1.0|I have given a review many a time now where I just say how generic a band is and blah blah blah, it gets old and boring to just say how bad these nu metal bands are.  Instead of ripping apart them and the genre they are part of I guess I can just describe how bad their songs are if that will help.  I have not heard this album, only the few singles that my ears have had to suffer through and I must tell you that this new album topped the last one in awful songs.  The melodies that they try to create are so boring and really make you feel nothing at all.  A band that writes good songs should make you want to do something when you hear their music.  Of course I am writing this review at an older age so maybe I just don't get the appeal in hook-less riffs with atrocious lyrics.  Maybe there is something there that I am just not seeing.  I work at a record store and you have no idea how much pain it causes me to see us sell out of bands like Linkin Park all the time when there is such better music just waiting to be discovered new and old.  Let's just hope that all of you youngsters grow up and find something that actually makes you feel something special.  This is an extreme case, but when you hear a song that hooks into you and makes you want to go out and start a band then you will have found something special, but if you are content to thrash about to this slop then please ignore everything I say.
B000002GVO|4.0|I'm truly astounded that anyone could give this album 1 star.  No, it's not their best work, but it's still a classic, and has probably one of the top 10  best rock songs of all time (the title track).  &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;New Kid In Town&quot;, and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; are all great songs that have earned their way into the popular music canon.  &quot;Wasted Time&quot; is also an excellent song.  &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, the last song, is an epic, beautifully-written song about (according to Don Henley) &quot;how the West was lost&quot;.  It's probably the most beautiful and most underrated Eagles song.<br />The reason I can't, in good conscience, give this album 5 stars is because of &quot;Pretty Maids All In A Row&quot; and &quot;Try And Love Again&quot;.  I suspect that these songs being on the album were a compromise that the band struck up internally so that bandmembers other than Henley or frey could get a chance to sing lead and write songs for the album.  Those two songs are really not up to usual Eagles standards.
B00005JM09|3.0|Beginning 10 years after T2, and 6 years after his mother Sara Conners death, John Conner is a pitiful wreck; with no Judgement Day to hone his leadership skills on he becomes a wandering drunken cyclist with a thing for animal tranquilizers.<br />This changes soon enough. The latest Terminator to be sent back, the T-X is an amalgam of the T-101 and the T-100: this means it can bring back complicated weapons from the future and still morph into others when necessary (to geeks who ask how it could come back at all, being non-organic, think; it probably had a sheath of skin cells over it during transport).<br />Its goal is to kill Conner's future leiutenants, who help in overthrowing Skynet. Conner himself becomes a secondary target.<br />However, he has to save his future second-in-command (and wife)<br />from the T-X. Problem is: daddy is in charge of the Skynet project, which is about to be unleashed to correct an internet virus that future Skynet initiated to ensure its creation.<br />Sounds deep? Maybe. But you'd never know it past the the crash-em-ups and neat booms. This is a dumbed-down version of T2 with an ending which should have come as a shock but instead seems not only predictable but boring.<br />It's still good escapist fun, with Ah-nuld giving as good as he ever has (the strip club and Elton John sunglasses were a nice twist on an old joke). Claire Danes has little to do here but scream and cry. The T-X never really becomes as menacing as either of the earlier models.<br />But it's a good matinee movie. Don't plan your night around it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|What a funny movie! This is true \\"family\\" entertainment, for everyone will enjoy it from Mom to Dad to Kid. Monsters Inc. is the leading source of energy for monster land. The premise is simple: Monsters scare children, when the children scream it is bottled as useable energy for monster land. James Sullivan (Goodman) is Monsters Inc's top scarer and his sidekick Mike (Crystal) is his assistant. Sully is about to break the All-Time Scare record when a child enters monster land. The rest is trying to return Boo (the child) back to her door and get her safely home. This movie is flat-out hilarious and not just for kids. Billy Crystal steals the show as Mike and has some great one liners. Goodman is too comfortable playing the lovable oaf Sully. James Cobern and Steve Buscemi round out the cast as Henry Waternoose (CEO of Monsters Inc.) and Randall Boggs (the villain) respectively. Overall, a wild ride and destined to become a Disney/Pixar classic. PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL!! Highly Recommended.

Grade: A+
0060090367|5.0|I LOVED this book a real page turner. I loved how Claire picks herself up and finds self worth. I found myself devouring each page and very well satisfied at the end. I've read Marian Keye's other novels- Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married and Last Chance Saloon before reading Watermelon. She's one of those authors where you look foward to future books.
B00008S2VG|5.0|All right, I've officially read enough nasty comments about Madonna lately to convince me that a column about \\"American Life\\" is in order. <br />I bought this gem at Tower Records on Broadway in the Village on April 25, four days after Madonna made a live appearance there. I have been happily listening to it ever since. I think I like \\"American Life,\\" Madonna's 16th album, even more than her highly acclaimed \\"Music\\" (2000) or \\"Ray of Light\\" (1998). <br />As Madonna evolves, her music gets better. Collaborating again with Mirwais Ahmadza, the techno-pop genius who co-produced \\"Music,\\" Madonna takes modern music into the future. <br />Some critics don't agree. They attack her personally rather than review her music. What did Madonna do to rock the boat this time? Make a controversial anti-war video and pull it at the last minute? Marry a Brit and abdicate by taking up part-time residence in London? Mature in a! world where the media is obsessed with youth and thinks you're irrelevant if you're over 21? It's hard to say. <br />My guess is Pink is \\"Missundazstood,\\" but critics have been misconstruing Madonna's work since I first saw her crawl across the stage in a white wedding dress at the first MTV Video Awards at Radio City in 1984. <br />Caught up in the artifice of celebrity, people forget that Madonna is an artist. She uses pop music as a vehicle to produce art. Great art is timeless. It's not controlled by trends, fads or a \\"Flavor of the Month\\" mentality. <br />On a recent interview on \\"Dateline,\\" Matt Lauer asked Madonna why she's still famous after 20 years? Would he ask Frida Kahlo or Virginia Woolf such an absurd question if they were alive today? I don't think so. Maybe it's time for all of us to wise up and realize that artists like Madonna and Sheryl Crow have turned pop and rock music into a legitimate art form that allows the best artists in th! e field to keep creating. <br />Great art is introspective. The m! ore pers onal it is the more universal itbecomes. Madonna reveals more about herself in \\"American Life\\" than ever before. She exhibits a vulnerability throughout that's easy to relate to. She speaks to what it feels like to be a human being; to fall in love and lose your sense of identity in \\"Static Process\\"; to exist in a world of unanswered questions in \\"Love Profusion\\"; to want to be a star for all the wrong reasons in \\"American Life\\" and \\"I'm So Stupid.\\" Madonna may have lived, like most of us, in a \\"fuzzy dream,\\" but she's wiser now and has so much more to say. <br />\\"Hollywood,\\" is my favorite track. I love the word and the meaning it conjures up; so much so, it's been turning up in my poems since 1982. Madonna nails it when she says, \\"How could it hurt you when it looks so good?\\" \\"Hollywood\\" is a catchy number, a brilliant anthem, which paints a pretty picture. But the song features a dicho! tomy, a dark side, which creates tension making it a classic we'll never forget. <br />Madonna doesn't mince words. In \\"Mother and Father,\\" one of the best and most personal songs, she sings in a high, child-like voice, repeating a refrain that anyone who's tried to escape childhood ghosts can identify with: \\"I've got to give it up. I've got to let it go,\\" Madonna wails, scaling notes. She recites a poem like a nursery rhyme in iambic pentameter recalling her mother's funeral when she was 5 and the traumatic after-effect: \\"Made a vow that I would never need another person. Never turned my heart into a cage. A victim of a kind of rage.\\" <br />\\"American Life\\" is a classic work of art. To miss it is a mistake. It includes other sophisticated songs like the title track from the latest James Bond flick, \\"Die Another Day,\\" as well as \\"Easy Ride.\\" It sums up where Madonna is at in the moment - in the here and now, with her fing! er on the pulse of society. Thinking what we're thinking.
B000023VR6|5.0|2001<br />2001 was a perfect comeback to Dr. Dre's The Chronic(1993). T here was not a track on this CD that was not worth of Aftermath. Songs like The Watcher and Still DRE have the funky G funk that dre is know for. And the Timbgaland like Forgot About Dre makes way for Eminem who KILLS on the hook and on his verse. B**** N*****  exposes us to The D.O.C.(the longlost member of NWA)'s protege, Six-Two. Some L.A.

B000022TSW|5.0|I first watched the South Park movie last night at midnight on comedy central. They were doing a special and showed the movie UNCUT with barely any commercial interruption. I loved this movie the moment it started.The beginning is like this: Stan comes out of his house and starts to sing a song about his \\"Quiet Little Mountain Town\\" and he goes around and gets his friends Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.Then, they go to an R rated movie and use a homeless man to make it look like its their guardian so they can see the movie. After viewing the movie, All of the boys talk trash big time:...The story goes that after viewing the movie, the four friends tell other boys and girls and then all the children of South Park and now using bad language and the Mothers of South Park get angry and declare war on Canada.>>>>>>> (Thats because the makers of the movie were canadian.)<br />Now, this movie is definetly not for kids, even though i am a kid, but i can handle this ...right? just kidding. anyway, theres a TON OF BAD LANGUAGE, LOTS OF SEXUAL REFERENCES, AND SOME GRAPHIC (ANIMATED) VIOLENCE. so dont let people under 13 watch it. just make sure people 13 and over can handle all the swearing. <br />PSSSST!: Heres an extra: in this episode, kenny goes to hell, and at the end, you see kenny's face! it looks like stans but it has messy blonde hair!!! also, kenny goes to heaven at the end.
0790744473|4.0|My Life, and a great song called Come to Me Bend to Me. Almost Like Being In Love is in the Campbell house, and Waitin' for My Deary isn't. Tommy and Jeff aren't in Bonnie Jean and there's more to Meg Brockie than what they have in the movie. And the Campbell family is actually the McLaren family. There's a sword dance before the reel and Tommy and Fiona don't do as much dancing as they did. <BR>But enough of the differences between stage and movie. It is an awesome movie, full or great, catchy songs and great dancing. My friends and I who were in it always got Bonnie Jean stuck in everybody'shead and who couldn't like Gene Kelly singing &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;? If you just watch the movie and not the play, then it is awesome. It shows true love is out there, you just don't know where you'll find it. And that &quot;the hardest part in life is giving up everything, but that's the only way you'll get everything.&quot;
B000000T01|5.0|This is my favorite movie! The best preformance by The Who is in this film. There best preformance was playing A Quick One While He's Away at the Rolling Stone's Rock And Roll Circus. The thing that pisses me off is that they only used a small section of the song and cut out Keith Richard's Introduction. If you love Keith Moon (Like I Do) get 200 Motels. Though I'll warn you it's kinda hard to find but if you do find it it'll be between 25.00 and 75.00.
B000002GK1|5.0|I believe this was the pinnacle album for the band.  I remember when it came out, a friend and I had picked up a copy within days of release.  It stayed in our disk players for some time.  Every track on the album simply rocks.  It blended enough of the early heavy grunge with enough moodiness and mellowness to create the best of Soundgarden.  For pure grunge sound, nothing beats Ultramega OK, but for the best of both Soundgarden worlds, this is it!
B0000040GZ|4.0|I love this movie, mainly because I was in the musical. I would have given it 5 stars but it is relatively different from the stage version. At least four songs aren't in the movie, Jeannie's Packing Up, My Mother's Wedding Day, The Real Love of My Life, and a great song called Come to Me Bend to Me. Almost Like Being In Love is in the Campbell house, and Waitin' for My Deary isn't. Tommy and Jeff aren't in Bonnie Jean and there's more to Meg Brockie than what they have in the movie. And the Campbell family is actually the McLaren family. If you just watch the movie and not the play, then it is awesome.

B00001ODHJ|5.0|I reccomend the bootleg dvd version, because it's so worth it! I cannot stress it enough, this is my least favorite out of the three, but I've seen it at least 6 times now. Oh, and if you get the bootleg dvd version, it has the origional ending- you need both endings! I got the vhs with the regular ending first and didn't realize there was another ending until I watched the dvd. Of course now I'm a big Evil Dead fan.

6303402348|5.0|I loved the story very much! <BR>It's one of the best film I ever seen.<BR>The actors act very well.<BR>It's never boring. The story has  a lot of senses, it's not  a simple movie. It tells us  a lot about the American history too!<BR>I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man.<BR>The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on.<BR>But what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.<BR>So I very enjoyed it and I highly recommended it!
0066620996|4.0|In this book, Jim Collins makes a case for working with discipline and patience to achieve something that you are passionate about. He points out that becoming great takes time and you have to work on it with a clear sense of your destiny, with the right people, and with conviction. I like the fact that Jim uses examples of companies that have not been extensively written about in other business books. In other words, the stories used in the book are fresh, not recyled.<br />The ideas are very appealing but as Jim admits himself, very difficult to implement in practice. Don't expect to apply these ideas and see a turnaround anytime soon! But at little over two hunderd pages, this book is well worth reading.

B000092ZYX|3.0|I found myself really liking parts of this CD but also scanning forward to get past some parts that just become obnoxious. How would i characterize this CD? Amazing and very progressive in some parts and boreing and bland in others. I want to love this CD but i find myself just sitting, listening, and saying to myself \\"God man ... where are you going with this ****?\\" I have read some reviewers in Amazon that talk about how this CD is a great mixture between thier rock roots and their recent jazzed out electronic progression, but i disagree. Amnesiac was that CD. This CD sounds more like some tourchered version of that.<br />Bottomline: Is this CD worth buying? Yes ... espessially if you compare it to the rest of the [music] that is being produced in todays mass market media. But Radiohead is capable (or at lest was) of much greater things than this CD and thus i can only give it three stars.
B00003CXTG|1.0|And now, ladies and gentlemen, let me present you one of the most pitiful big movies in these last years. A complete disaster. And a disgrace.<br />As soon as he starts shooting, Michael Bay takes the wrong direction: the title of his film is supposed to show us the wheels of the U.S. navy based in the Pacific. Instead we see some young, fanatized American boys playing heroes in army plane cockpits. When we see what's gonna happen to them next, this scene is nothing but laughable and useless and Bay could have done without it. After that we have nothing but sentimental, sugar scenes, lasting at least three long quarters until the Japanese come in with their planes. The film really takes off only at this moment.<br />Actually the Japanese attack on the Pearl Harbor base, which is the pretext for Bay and his technicians, to take a huge delight in action and special effects - the bombings were shot in the same place than James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" - is there only to save a frankly foolish and unsignificant love story (a young nurse, pretty, devoted but real common, falls in love with two cute G.I.s; one of them sinks into the sea but comes back, in one piece and in top form - how can he do it? -, the other one gets killed in the end and everything turns out OK) we don't believe in for a single second. The movie is worth watching only for the long scenes of destruction of the U.S. navy, even if the heroism is truly base. But what can be the most unpleasant in this film is the attitude of the American high-ranking officers who, after the Japanese attack, launch out into a bloody vendetta. We all know what'll be next: the United States enter the war and follow the Pacific battle (see \\"The thin red Line\\" a much, much better movie), the beaching in Normandy (without even warning), and of course, the atomic bombs on Japan. This after-\\"Pearl Harbor\\" is explored by Bay the lousiest way but shows and tells us much about American soldiers, who think they have the status of gods nobody has the right to attack.<br />How could Hollywood be able to show so much despise, such a lack of respect to the memory of all the soldiers and civilian people who died during the bombings? Only for the purpose of big money - the film was a huge success -? And how could talentful screenwriter Randall Wallace (author of \\"Braveheart\\") get involved in a project like this? That is the main questions we have the right to ask to ourselves... About the actors, if gloomy Josh Hartnett (seen later in \\"Black Hawk Down\\") is very convincing and happens to be the only good point of the film, Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale are so simple that they turn out desperating and Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore and Alec Baldwin don't belong in there. \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is the kind of luxurious daub, desperately syrupy, with a window violence, to be urgently kept from a good distance. Instead watch again \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" from Richard Fleischer (and Kurosawa) which, with the same story, avoids any lousy sentimentality, or see \\"The thin red Line\\" over and over again.
0930289234|5.0|If you have ever asked yourself \\"What if super heroes were real,\\" then you should read this. The book follows two groups of super heroes. One is the original group who retired long ago, and the second group are their predecesors who were forced to retire early by the government. The second group is in their middle ages, but they might still be active if not for the government. A series of masked vigilante murders brings the second group out of retirement to find the killer. Also You'll love the character Rorshack. If someone tried to be Batman, then this is who they would be. So go read it, and if you do read it, then you will want to read it from front to back in one shot. However, that's kinda hard; because it is long. It does gets slow in some spots,but it is worth the read. It's not just a good comic book, but it's a good book to read. Anyone who has ever tried to reshape a comic universe is just following in Moore's footsteps. After you read it, you will be sad that there will never be an additional part of the story. why? Alan Moore emphaticly expressed that there will never be a sequel to the Watchmen.
B000066NW0|3.0|Does it matter if people write the lyrics to their own songs - or even the notes for that matter? No! My man Miles Davis didn't write some of his songs but still turned in some wonderful music. Musicians in an orchestra don't write their symphonies and they still turn in excellent music. <BR>How about we just let people like what they want. &quot;Good music is that which is pleasing to the ear.&quot; I think this well-known composer offers a perfect working definition since it allows for subjectivity, which is what music is. I've had enough elitist pseudo-know-it-all complaints about music for this lifetime.<BR>As far as Avril goes, I don't care for it, but music is music and someone else will.<BR>End of rant.
0375414932|4.0|This is my second biggest disappointment in reading this summer, the first being Graham Swift's \\"The Light of Day.\\"  Boyd's first novel since the marvelous \\"Armadillo,\\" \\"Any Human Heart\\" reads like a sandwich (albeit a gourmet sandwich) without the meat.  Like \\"The New Confessions,\\" which focused on the movie industry, this term-of-the-century novel takes its hero, an ecrivain manqu&eacute;, from his childhood in Uruguay, to his young boyhood at a British public school, through a number of ill-fated (and deadly boring) love affairs, to his interment as a spy in Switzerland (!) during World War II, to a teaching stint in Nigeria, and his unfortunate flirtation with the Baader-Meinhof gang.  There's considerable scope here for comedy of the type Boyd excels in, but little is made of the opportunity.  Logan Mountstuart is basically a whiner, a man born into privilege who blows every chance he has (and they are many) to succeed.  He writes a couple of popularly well-received novels (one is deemed by critics a \\"nastily unpleasant little shocker\\") early in his career then fails to produce for the next forty to fifty years.  I liked Logan best as a Stalky-like schoolboy, replete with a small cabal of geek friends, who learns he doesn't know as much as he thinks he does, about girls and football, among other things, and as an old gent living in London, who discovers that dog food, while it may not be gourmet fare, can be a suitable substitute in times of need.  The story ends in France, where Logan makes one last, quixotic gesture in the name of love, and falls once again on his face.  If you're looking for a superior examination of the writer's craft, try Anthony Burgess' monumental \\"Earthly Powers,\\" or Penelope Lively's brilliant cameo, \\"Moon Tiger.\\"  There is much to like about \\"Any Human Heart,\\" including some exquisite descriptive prose, and I certainly recommend it, especially to fans of Boyd, but if you're waiting for another work of comic genius like \\"Stars and Bars\\" or \\"A Good Man in Africa,\\" be patient.  We all know Boyd has it in him.Good Man in Africa,\\" be patient.  We all know Boyd has it in him.
B000000Y27|5.0|The coming out LP &quot;The Incredible Jazz Guitar Of Wes Montgomery&quot; is a great intro CD to Wes, and still one of the best out there. Riverside Records (and Orrin Keepnews) was lucky enough to get a lot more from Wes in the studio, and anyone who can not rest until hearing more Wes at his best should try to check out ALL of the Riverside stuff. This LP was re-released in the early 70s along with &quot;So Much Guitar&quot; as a double album. The personnel on &quot;So Much Guitar&quot; includes Hank Jones, Ron Carter, Lex Humphries, and Ray Barretto. I have not seen this on CD as a single disc as yet; however, there is a compilation of all Wes' Riverside work - &quot;The Complete Riverside Recordings&quot; - and it includes out-takes (yes...Wes was human after all!) and my favorite cut from &quot;So Much Guitar&quot;...the stunning solo piece &quot;While We're Young&quot;. Start with this CD, but dig further and you will be richly rewarded.
6303347657|5.0|With a typical Jim Carrey hero -- a nobody with a frighteningly suppressed very angry somebody -- this movie takes it's shocking moments from the the transitions to animation and back; the \\"normality\\" of the real life that is killing Carrey; the utter moral darkness of the Gotham type city in which he is caught.  I agree with another reviewer that Jim Carrey's ability to work with his anger and withdraw from the darker landscape of the city (not take sides) is the really heroic part of the movie.  AND the dog is very cute.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I'm not a huge a Star Trek fan, but I have enjoyed the movies as well as the Next Generation TV series.  As such, I found this latest movie to be an enjoyable and comfortable entry in the series.  Continuing the trend of the even number movies being better, Nemesis (#10) is arguably better then Insurrection (#9).  Plus, many favorites pop up in cameos.<br />The Plot: An apparent coup d'etat occurs on Romulus, and the Enterprise is sent to investigate.  When Picard meets the new leader of the Romulans, he's shocked to see a striking resemblance to himself.  The Enterprise crew try to work with the new leader, but suspect treachery.  The special effects are not particularly impressive, especially in light of other recent sci-fi movies, but then Star Trek has never been just about the f/x.  The movie explores issues of cloning in a relatively interesting, but precursory, manner.  The DVD includes many deleted scenes, which help explain some of the underdeveloped plots (e.g., Troi's mind-melding) and underused characters (e.g., Dr. Crusher).<br />Overall, a pretty good Star Trek movie that is likely to appease fans of the series; non-fans are likely to be a bit bored and unimpressed.  Patrick Stewart has said that this movie is the last for the Next Generation crew, so enjoy!
B000000NN1|3.0|Since this is quite praised album, I had high expections on this one. Unfortunately, I found themes of this album relatively uninteresting. There is nothing catchy really.
B00005JM09|4.0|Dont get me wrong. Terminator 3 was not bad, it was a good decent movie. I will watch it again and buy it when it comes out on dvd. But Mostow doesnt know how to put in the action like Cameron did. T3 has action, but it doesnt have enough as T2 did. Cameron really should have been the one to direct it and bring back the original cast instead of new people. T3 does have it good points though. If they ever make a T4, I hope they will correct many of the mistakes put into this movie. If Arnold wants to do it again, but I'm sure he will get tired doing another Terminator over and over again. The ending was also a downfall, I thought it could have been better. Thats about it. It just means that theres a possibility for a T4. But other than that, a good movie.
B000002NJS|5.0|Five years ago, when I bought this CD, I wasn't interested in techno.  Therefore, I was nervous about it.  I listened to it, and I was stunned!  This is by far the best CD Madonna has recorded.  Her raw emotion is the key to its quality.<br />     She begins &quot;Ray of Light&quot; with the emotional &quot;Substitute For Love&quot;.  This bold opener sets the theme to the album defining how she's matured.  &quot;Ray of Light&quot; defines the entire genre of techno/dance.  &quot;Ashanti&quot; is a prayer that defines the entire kaballah religion with its intense spirituality.  &quot;Little Star&quot; proves that a lullaby can have techno sounds, which I'm sure moved her daughter, Lola.<br />     William Orbit is a genius producer.  I hope she works with him again.  If you're into techno and unique music, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; should be on your wish list.
B00005JM09|5.0|After reading online reviews both pro and con and the lack of James Cameron helming this film I walked in with low expectations. I was begining to despair that Summer Blockbusters were all going to be vanilla PG-13 affairs. Director Jonathan Mostow has succesfully brought back THE action, R-Rated Blockbuster with T-3. This movie was quite a surprise. It starts well and keeps you enthralled the whole way through. The special effects are way better than the early trailers, the action amazing, and the story a thoughtful evolution from T2. Arnold's back in full force, Kristanna Loken as the TX is both menacing AND sexy. Nick Stahl could have possibly been better as John Conner but doesn't detract from the film. Even Claire Danes, who I normally dislike was good. One of the most surprising things about this film is how funny it is, both with dialogue and situations. It's clearly self-parodying without being too campy. More than T2 I think Mostow has captured the feel of one-ton killing machines fighting each other with Hulk-like ferocity. Also at several points the audience screamed from violent or \\"shocking\\" bits.. all in all it was a great movie experience that has action, comedy and some scares. Go see it and let's bring back the R-Rated Summer Blockbusters of old! ;-)
B00005JM09|5.0|I just went and saw the earliest showing Of T3, and there were 40 cars in the parking lot, and they were all for T3. The movie was incredible. The Special Effects were Phenomonal. The car chase scene in T3 easily beats the Chase scene in T2, with John Connor on the bike and the T-1000 in the big rig. The story was true to the series, and didn't have any problems with the previous Terminator movies. Everything rings true. The acting is awesome. Overall, i don't think any action movie will ever top Terminator 2. But this latest installment is the next best thing. It DESTROYS the matrix reloaded, even though some thought it wouldn't. all in all, the best movie i've seen all year.

This is the masterpiece of rock's most self indulgent maniac (\\"I've suffered for my art\\" --he seems to whine--, now it's your damn turn!!\\").

B00005JLXE|4.0|Every few months it seems, marvel is releasling a movie adaptation of one of its classic comicbooks.  This year, we have had (or will have) \\"X2,\\" \\"The Hulk,\\" and \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\\"  But buried beneath them, is \\"Daredeveil,\\" a frenetic, eye-catching spectacle, but with enough heart and humor to help rise above it rumored shallowness.  Key to the movies' success is Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, who hits the right amount of brood and anger as \\"The Man with no Fear.\\"  I would say that \\"Daredevil\\" reasserted my confidence in Affleck as a good actor.  <br />As a boy, Matt Murdock is blinded by a chemical waste accident, but his other senses functioned at superhuman levels, more than making up for his lack of sight.  As a man, he is a determined lawyer representing the downtrodden in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York.  At night, he wages a secret war against crime as Daredevil, a red-leather clad superhero.  His new enemy is the rumored Kingpin (an imposing Michael-Clark Duncan), one man who controls all the crime in New York.  At his disposal, Kingpin has a legion of criminals, most dangerous is the gleefully evil Bullseye (a delicious Colin Farrel) who can turn any object into a lethal projectile.  Caught up in the middle is Elecktra (a beautiful Jennifer Garner) who develops a relationship with Murdock and her doomed father (Erik Avari).<br />Even though \\"Daredevil\\" is a satisfying action movie, it does leave room for improvement for its inevitable sequels.  The characters could use a little more development, and the story could use a little tightening.  Also, was the play-fight between Murdock and Elecktra in the playground necessary?  I don't know.  To me, it seemed a little shallow as it balantly goes for eye-filling candy, instead of a little substance.  But other than that, \\"Daredevil\\" is a dark, lurid and satisfying action flick.

B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses put out this rookie album and it just blew up!  Every song on this CD is a radio worthy single, from the first single \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" to their #1 hit \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" and everything that falls in between.  This is the only GNR album where everything was clicking in the group and it showed.  If they could have kept AXL's ego in check they would possibly have become the GREATEST band in American history.  You must buy this CD if you are new to the rock world or even if your a heavy rock enthusiast who hasn't got the record yet.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!        GNR FOREVER
B00005UEAR|5.0|just buy it. <br />they literally redefine music. i thought metropolis part 2 was unbeatably good. HAH! i was wrong. i love this one even more i think. its just complete mind blowing music. you'll be left sitting there wondering what hit you after a listen to this double disc effort.<br />for me the second disc was phenomenal. it takes off on the music in acts theme from metropolis. the cd 2 has one song, with a common theme split into various parts and moods. each tells a story that's all interlaced and joined together in the last (8th)part. wonderful music, complex and challenging to listen to. <br />the first CD has 5 songs. all really good. my personal favourites are Blind Faith and Misunderstood. they just build up and keep building. <br />i don't see what i can say, its a must must buy for absolutely anyone. its got orchestral parts that would challenge beethoven. its got amazing guitar pieces to challenge the likes of vai and satriani. the drumming is out of this world. portnoy is probably the single best drummer in the world. you'll just be sitting there wondering how the heck they managed to play that with a stupid grin on your face.<br />like i said...just buy it.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies of all time.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, and Renee Zellweger did an awesome performance.  This movie is way better then Moulin Rouge by singing, dancing, and overall entertainment.  Chicago compared to Moulin Rouge is no comparison at all.  I cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD.  Like the movie i predict that the DVD will be spectacular.  If you liked Moulin Rouge i can almost bet that you would love Chicago.  In fact, you may even like it more.  I loved the movie Moulin Rouge, i consider it a classic, but when i saw Chicago it replaced Moulin Rouge in two seconds.  This movie is truely amazing and a magnificant show that I suggest everybody see.  I am extremely happy Chicago won best picture because it definitly deserved it.  Chicago has become a classic.
0393057658|4.0|Michael Lewis, by trade a financial journalist, has brought his knowledge and background in financial markets to bear on the subject of baseball.  Lewis saw the Oakland A's do as well or better than many teams whose payrolls were far in excess of that of the A's and he realized a parallel to what arbitrageurs and hedge fund managers on Wall St. do: the A's saw inefficiencies in the market in which they participated--the labor of elite athletes (if baseball players can be considered athletes)--and sought to exploit those inefficiencies to their benefit.<br />A little background is due here.  Lewis draws a parallel between the revolution that computing power brought to Wall St.--derivatives, specifically, and the ability to analyze reams of statistical data quickly, generally--and the analysis of baseball statistics.  Much like Michael Milken made a killing on trading bonds, or Michael Bloomberg made a killing on developing a computer system through which the Milkens of the world could analyze their data, Lewis insists, quite convincingly, that their are statisitcal analyses much more relevant to and predictive of success on the diamond than the simplistic statistics with which we are all familiar--fewest errors, most home runs, most strikeouts, most steals, etc.<br />It is on these points that Lewis excels.  He brings a clarity of thought to bear on these abstractions that is rare for a journalist.  His explanation of the theoretical underpinning of the A's success as of late is excellent and is accessible by a layman (of which I am one).<br />However, in an effort to evoke the constant tension between those more theoretical practitioners of the game and the more traditionally-minded 'tools' men--those people for whom strikeouts and homeruns and the most predictive measure of success--Lewis allows his narrative to veer from the clarity of his theoretical explanations.  All too often I dinf Lewis' depiction of inside banter to be confusing, if not irrelevant.  Ratherthan try to contextualize a lot of banter, Lewis instead throws reference, discussion, terminology, and name atop one another for extended paragraphs--and then brings this discussion back to the tension which originally intrigued him.<br />What Lewis tries to do, and what I don't find entirely convincing, is evoke through a narrative style the tension between the old and the new.  Of course, there is precedent for this: his earlier and more well known book Liar's Poker tried to demonstraste the culture of trading floors in the early and mid-1980s.<br />I recommend the book with the understanding that its dialogue is burdensome and distracts from the rest of the otherwise excellent introduction to how exploitation of inefficiencies in a market can give a poor organization returns disproportionate to the resources that organization has to devote to the market.

Yes, there are laughs, but it's all tastefully done, and youngsters will enjoy rewatching the funniest parts.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As an old World War II veteran who \\"was there and did that\\" in the European Theater of Operations, I'm compelled to mention that there are a few relatively minor technical flaws in the film.  One rather obvious one is the way \\"Captain Sobel\\" wears his garrison cap in the first episode.  This is particularly annoying, since the role is that of an officer obsessed with Army rules and regulations.  In those days we were taught that the garrison cap was always to be worn \\"two fingers over the right ear and one finger over the right eyebrow.\\"  In the film \\"Sobel\\" wears his cap on the left side toward the back of his head.  Captain Dale Dye, technical advisor for the film, dropped the ball on that one and some others...probably because he was Marine rather than Army.<BR>   Despite it and a few other small flaws of that nature, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is exceptionally accurate, authentic, powerful and moving.  In particular, I was impressed with the honesty and realism of the emotions displayed in the film.  All of the young actors in the ensemble cast are very credible.  The performances of Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, and Donnie Wahlberg are especially effective.<BR>   The unexpected and very graphic sex scene set in Germany on one of the discs was totally gratuitous.  The shortsighted writers and producers could have omitted it entirely without sacrificing the integrity of the film.  The film can and should be used to enhance the teaching of World War II history.  However, teachers may be inhibited from showing it to youth under 14, merely because of one questionable X-rated scene.  Of course, one could argue that war itself is obscene.
B000068QY7|5.0|What I find interesting is that the whole reason why America and Oasis \\"don't get on\\" is because they rip-off The Beatles. In actual fact this is the whole reason why we love them over here. Perhaps it is time America should see through this problem a little bit more? There is no doubt about it, they are the biggest band in the UK and in my views the best rock band to date. Forget Radiohead (they change their style every album). Forget Coldplay (they never really were rock in the first place, were they?). Forget Stereophonics (their music is sometimes a bit too \\"happy\\" for my liking), here is a band that can amalgamate The Doors, The Beatles, The Who, Rolling Stones and actually do it WELL! With this new album Heathen Chemistry it is a good return to the roots. And whilst the lyrics are not perhaps as emotionally strong as Morning Glory, it is probably the second best album they have made. Personally I don't like to look at it in terms of \\"best\\" because being a TRUE Osis fan (and they don't come much bigger than UK fans), I tend to look at all the albums as \\"AMAZING\\", not one of them are indeed considered not as good as the last and blah blah blah. All albums have good tracks you will play over and over and doing a little percentage test I worked out that I played 90% of Oasis songs in comparison to 65% of Radiohead - that's not good! Yes this album is amazing, truly amazing, the music, the lyrics are still good on some songs... but was it really the lyrics in the first place? Because reviewers were very finnicky over here at the time of the album's release date. In truth I go back on my word, it isn't lyrics, it is the fact Oasis do not change their style and to be honest that is not what I class as a bad thing. In England we love them for who they are. The best rock band of the 90's and they are now in the milennium where things can only get better. And perhaps America should wake up and view them in exactly the same way we do. Music quality does not get any better than this. In my view \\"Aquiesce\\" is the best song they have ever made. For the non-Oasis fans out there in the States, all you have to do to experience this song, is buy the single \\"Some Might Say\\", what's that about $5?? Not a lot of money if you ask me. I rest my case. Enough Said!
B000063DFN|5.0|After obtaining their new (and current, today) drummer, Nicko McBrain, Maiden produced \\"Piece of Mind\\" and received more acclaim and success.  1984 rolls around and they produce \\"Powerslave\\" and hit even bigger heights.  Some fans claim it's overrated, and that MIGHT be somewhat true... but still, it's a 5 star album in my book.  In fact, \\"Powerslave\\" was the album that got me hooked into Maiden in the first place, and that fate was forever sealed when I heard \\"Somewhere in Time.\\"  With that said, this review continues:<br />Aces High - An undeniably catchy rocker.  This is what Maiden's all about.  The trade-off solos here are among the band's finest.<br />2 Minutes to Midnight - WOW, great!  Adrian Smith is in fine form in his guitarmanship here!  One of the best non-Steve Harris penned songs the band has ever produced.<br />Losfer Words - The instrumental track on the album.  Not bad, but probably the weakest in comparison to the other tracks.<br />Flash of the Blade - The VERY FIRST Maiden song I ever listened to.  Sounds kinda dull in guitars, but it's intentionally good.  I love the subject matter of middle-aged dueling.  One of the finest Bruce Dickinson-penned songs.  A very underrated song.<br />The Duellists - Another song involving dueling, this all-out rocker is a pretty good one.  The chorus is a little on the weak side, but a decent song overall; give this one a second chance upon first listening.<br />Back in the Village - A little odd at first with its unique riff, but I like it a lot better now.  In fact, what hooked me was the fact that it's part 2 to the \\"Number of the Beast\\" track, The Prisoner, also based on the television series!<br />Powerslave - The monstrous title track of the album.  Bruce Dickinson's vocals hit new heights with this song and it's a damn good rocker.  However, the magnum opus of this album hasn't come yet...<br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner - WOW, THIS IS MAIDEN'S BEST EPIC EVER AND THE BEST TRACK FROM THIS ALBUM, HANDS DOWN!  Maiden is truly sophisticated here and the instrumentation combined with Bruce's superb vocals makes for one of their finest songs ever.  A truly great track that doesn't wear out its 13 minutes.<br />Overall, a SOLID Maiden album.  Takes a little getting used to because it's not as heavy as \\"Piece of Mind,\\" but the songs are very well-written all the same.  With the success of this, they continued with their 1985 live effort, \\"Live After Death,\\" and would move into the experimental areas...N!

B00005JM09|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little skeptical if this movie would be good.  James Cameron and Linda Hamilton didn't participate (in which case, the writers had her character, Sarah Connor, dead before the film started), so naturally that was a concern for me.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, however, decided to join up because the script was pretty good, and after I heard that Jonathan Mostow (\\"U571\\") was directing, my fears were put away and I laid out some hope.<br />After watching it, I was blown away.  It wasn't overdone and over the top; it REALLY was a Terminator film!  Director Mostow kept the film fresh but also using numerous hints to the previous Terminator films.  Nick Stahl was good as John Connor (am I the ONLY one that didn't care for Edward Furlong??) and Claire Danes did ok as John's soon-to-be wife.  And of course, I can't write this review without mentioning Kristanna Loken as the evil T-X (a.k.a. Terminatrix... sounds like a Matrix cash-in, but oh well); incredibly sexy and deadly at the same time.<br />And finally, of course, we have Arnold back and he seriously doesn't look any older than he did back in 1991.  This guy's 60 now and he played the part as if he was merely on vacation from doing the previous Terminator film!  Oh, and remember Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) from the first two?  Watch out for his amusing cameo.<br />The action hardly lets up and while I don't want to compare it to the other Terminators, I will say this: the action hardly lets up, which is something T2 should've done.  Also, I enjoyed the dark ending with its nefarious plot twist.<br />While it did have its plot holes, it didn't detract from the film much at all.  It kept to the style of the Terminator films, but seemed fresh and new at the same time.  That is probably its greatest merit, and boy, does Mr. Mostow bring the film to life.<br />As for you people [complaining] about no James Cameron, get your heads out of your [.....] and accept the film.  The movie did great without him and let me remind you that the film still has producers Mario Kassar (T2) and Gale Ann Hurd (Cameron's ex-wife AND CO-CREATOR OF THE TERMINATOR) and creative makeup artist Stan Winston behind the scenes, so they have an idea of Cameron's vision.  With that said, just sit back and enjoy.nd let me remind you that the film still has producers Mario Kassar (T2) and Gale Ann Hurd (Cameron's ex-wife AND CO-CREATOR OF THE TERMINATOR) and creative makeup artist Stan Winston behind the scenes, so they have an idea of Cameron's vision.

0440236738|3.0|This mystery captures the attention of the reader from the first page and manages to hold it throughout the book despite that annoying habit of jumping from scene to scene with each chapter. The story was allowed to work itself out and it came back on itself in the end - almost like a Mobius strip.<br />The biggest flaw was a commmon one in mystery writing - all the assumptions of the characters were proved invalid by events to which the reader had no access.  In a sense it reminds one of the Soaps where the problem is resolved by the sudden appearance of the unknown twin who has just woken from a 15 year state of amnesia.   This is not quite as bad but [CAUTION:  STORY NOTES FOLLOW] when the sister suddenly steps out from behind the buses to tell the world the long-hidden truth and John shows up to add his version of the truth about Carly (it DOES sound like a soap) the reader can rightly call \\"Foul\\".  <br />Stories with last page resolutions are a dime a dozen and in this case it's sad.

This is a real good movie, however &quot;not exactly a phenomenon&quot; as Steven Speilberg claims in a brief interview on the DVD. The DVD in itself with all the extra bonus materials is outstanding. I found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the years-worth animation included with the live-action, get it produced, make countless sketches, and finally get it out to the theaters. Well done. Very well done. I couldn't be more pleased and more impressed with this special DVD release. It's definitely a must-have.

B00003CXI0|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and was so psyched when the movies started being made. Except for a few minor changes, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone could not have been made any better. The sound and diction is excellent as well as the acting, the sets are phenomenal and whoever casted the characters obviously read the book many times because everyone was exactly how I imagined them when I was reading the books. Now I can put in one of the movies and relive the magic of Harry Potter without having to read the book. I can not even describe how much joy the Harry Potter series has given me, and am glad that the movies were made exactly like the books; beyond outstanding.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I dont think 5 stars does this justice.  This album has the power to even change peoples lives.  The lyrics, the music everything plays in on this album.  In my mind, its definately the best album of radiohead.  The way they incorporate all these instruments and make it sound wonderful is a feat inside of itself.  Im not here to bash all the other bands people listen to or whatever music they're into but seriously, if you listen to all this bands who just play 2 power chords during their whole song and decide to sing about how they're not rich and famous then you dont deserve this album.  Its much too good for the likes of someone like that.  It may sound selfish but anyone who has heard this album and truly understands and likes it would agree with me.  I never get bored of any of the songs.  Definately pick it up if you like radiohead or any band really along the lines of their music.

B00005JKZV|3.0|LOTR The Two Towers is a great movie, I shall say is even better than the first installment The Fellowship of the Ring, this is more action packed, more character development and more drama. I know that if you enjoyed on the movie screen you will enjoy it as well on your DVD player, but I strongly reccomend you wait for the extended DVD version and save your money for that ocassion. I made the mistake of getting the first DVD version of \\"Fellowship\\" and then I regreted, because it came a few months later the extended DVD version with more scenes (and I'm talking big scenes of 30 minutes not just little deleted scenes), sure it's a little expensive, but if you are a fan of the LOTR saga surely you will appreciate that.<br />If you want the movie and not the extras go ahead and get this DVD but if you like me and many out there are the ones who wants to get the more out of a great movie, do yourself a favor and wait for the extended DVD edition. Your pocket and yourself will appreciate that a lot.

0446691437|5.0|This is an outstanding book for all those frustrated in their search for creative fulfillment.  <br />In it, the author puts forward some very interesting hypotheses.  For example, he argues that it is creative frustration that is basically the root of all that ails society.  To someone who suffers from it primarily, I guess it can look that way, and may even in fact be that way.  <br />I'm not certain everything in the book is correct or the best approach to looking at the problem.  But I think people struggling with these issues should read it thoroughly and decide for themselves.  <br />In some ways a more masculine approach that Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones or Cameron's The Artist's Way, Pressfield anthrpomorphises artist's block as &quot;Resistance&quot;, an enemy to be fought and defeated daily.  Seems exhausting, and it probably is.<br />I'm currently looking around for really effective solutions to this issue.  Most advice comes down to &quot;just do it&quot; but this book provides an interesting framework to think about the problem.<br />I would very much enjoy living in a world where the problem of creative block was solved comprehensively.

Alot of cheesy background vocals as well. If you want to hear good megadeth get &quot;peace sells&quot; or &quot;Rust in peace&quot;, or any other megadeth cd except maybe &quot;risk&quot;.
B00000ADG2|5.0|The world seemed to be Lauryn Hill's oyster in 1998 after this CD was released. To put it mildly, this CD is fantastic. Fresh off her work with the Fugees, Hill manages to make an album that is full of feeling and emotion, power and raw energy. The production is superb, the hooks for all the tracks are well done. There are definate gems on this album besides the tracks that became singles (That Thing (Doo-Wop), Everything is Everything, and Ex-Factor). The song To Zion (with Carlos Santana) is one of the most powerful songs ever. This is definately a hip-hop album worth having.

B000001FS3|5.0|It would be easy to include this album on a list of the top 10 albums ever. U2's exploration into the roots of American music still stands as their most popular and well known album ever. This is U2 at their best. The music is top notch, the production is tight yet raw, and Bono sounds as good as ever. It's been 16 years since this album first came out, but it should still be on everyone's list of &quot;must have&quot; albums.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I never heard this singer before but thought I would give her a try and quite honestly did not care for her at all.  She is so pretty though.  She sounds alot to me like Janis Joplin but then I did not care for her years ago either.  Sorry.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby's venture into American roots music and the work of Alan Lomax has produced a definitive album. The concept was unique when Moby first pushed it forth, and it was a good concept to push. The roots music hooks that Moby works into many of the songs on the album, combined with Moby's unique take on techo and trance make this album the best place to start for all new Moby fans.
B00005JL78|2.0|Incredible visuals.  Stunning special effects.  Edge-of-your-seat thrills and spills.<br />Yep:  Steven Spielberg, all right.<br />Yet MINORITY REPORT is more glitter than it is gold.  It is an uneven, inconsistent, often incoherent film, set in a future so imposing and Orwellian I'm darn glad I'll never live to see it.  And what on earth was with mainframe computers being controlled by dramatic hand gestures?  The future looks solid for all you budding musical conductors out there.<br />The premise of the film on its face is illegal and unethical:  arrest someone before he or she commits a crime--a crime as foretold by three troubled clairvoyants floating in water.  At least I appreciated the discourse--however brief--between the advocates of Washington, D.C.'s \\"Precrime Division\\" and a concerned FBI investigator (Colin Farrell) regarding the feasibility of metaphysical crime prevention.  It was interesting stuff, then promptly discarded for the next chase scene.<br />Tom Cruise, as usual, is solid as Precrime Detective John Anderton, an enthusiastic proponent of hauling people away before they commit murder until he himself is the target of a relentless manhunt by his former colleagues.  Max von Sydow as Precrime Director Lamar Burgess looks exactly like the aging priest he played in \\"The Exorcist\\" thirty years ago (that was all I could think about as I watched him).  Sure, there's plenty of heart-pounding action, and Spielberg also throws in a few gross video wedgies to make us recoil uncomfortably, yet MINORITY REPORT falls short of effective storytelling, and even dissolves into a contrived, constipated ending.<br />--D. Mikels
B00005U1YO|4.0|Come With Us is not the album that really takes the Chemicals in major new directions, but they do polish the big beat sound and provide a wonderfully smooth album that can still move you. It Began In Afrca is a wonderful example of what a little thinking out of the box will get you to. The title track is also quite good, incorporating a violin sample that works well. Overall, for fans who love the Chemical Brothers sound, this is the album to get for those post Dig Your Own Hole cravings.
B00000K19E|5.0|My alltime favorite movie. I was absolutely blown away by this movie the first time I saw it. Now I'm blown away everytime I watch it. As soon as it finished I was dying for a sequel. I never thought it would turn into a trilogy. This movie was an absolute flawless picture. Everyday I go on the net and find out new things about the movie that I nevber thought were true. Hooked! I am absolutely hooked!!!
B00000J8EK|3.0|This album is good in that it tries to expand the big beat magic that made Dig Your Own Hole such a popular mainstream dance/electronica album, but it doesn't do it so well. The overall machine-like 1980s computer sounds on tracks like &quot;Music: Response&quot; and &quot;Hey Boys, Hey Girls&quot; decreases the worth of many of the tracks. There are some decent gems to be found here (&quot;Out of Control&quot; happens to be a personal favorite), but Come With Us is a better example of the Chems expanding that magic that is big beats.
B000002J1F|3.0|What happened here?  Yes fires Tony Kaye for Rick Wakeman?  Okay here are the differences w/ Kaye & Wakeman.  Wakeman, who played the famous Mellotron track to David Bowie's 1969 hit \\"Space Oddity,\\" has a backlog of keyboards in his possession.  Wakeman at that time displayed an army of Minimoogs, a Mellotron Mark II, a Steinway Grand Piano, an RMI electric piano, and lastly, a massive Hammond Organ C3.  All Tony Kaye had was just your Steinway Piano, a Minimoog, a Mellotron, & his Hammond Organ M102 (a spinet for which he did some major damage on, soundwise).  <br />Wakeman & Kaye were both classically trained.  Wakeman used all the instruments mentioned above on stage, Kaye only used his M102 organ w/ the Minimoog later.  Wakeman had stage presence for which he moved from instrument to instrument.  The only presence from Kaye was his no compromising roaring Hammond sound.  Unlike \\"Yes,\\" \\"Time & A Word.\\" & \\"The Yes Album,\\" \\"Fragile\\" barely has any keyboard work on the songs, if not no presence barely.  There is no question Wakeman was more an experienced musician who had a backlog of insturments, but he lacks the presence, rawness & dexteritory of what Kaye had....  major balls behind his Hammond sound.  <br />The major element that's forever lost in Yes is that distorted, angry Hammond sound that Kaye possessed.  Wakeman doesn't even distort his Hammond C3 'cept for the song that made me buy this album & should've been at least 3 minutes long, \\"Five Percent For Nothing.\\"  This album is more the work of Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Steve Howe, & of course Chris Squire.  You can here them all over the place just about, except for Wakeman who barely contributes.  Even though every member has a song of their own, Wakeman doing \\"Cans & Brahams\\" in general, you barely hear Rick in \\"Roundabout,\\" though he does contributes very well in \\"The South Side of the Sky\\" & \\"Long Distance Runaround.\\"  If Kaye was in for this album, I think you hear more keyboards, mainly more loud,roaring Hammond Organ for this is what the album lacks.  I get the impression that Wakeman's use was on stand-by.<br />What was the reason?  Why was Tony Kaye, who did some severe damage behind a little Hammond M102 spinet & was all over the place, fired in order to bring in Rick Wakeman, who never distorted his massive Hammond C3 & is barely heard at all?
1559409002|5.0|YOUR REVIEWERS NEED TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK.  I originally saw this film in SLC about 3 years after it was made.  The river may have been in Lawrence, Kansas, but the other scenes are in SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH and at the SALTAIR RESORT on the Great Salt Lake.  The scenes at the 'carnival pavillion' are of the SALTAIR ballroom and amusement park.  My parents met at a dance there in 1934 when the lake was still high but a small train ride was needed to reach the shore for bathing. Originally you just walked down the stairs to the water.   Later the pavillion, still on the original pilings (shown in the next to last scene) was just used as an amusement park.   I rode their huge roller coaster in 1956. The lake continued to receed, the roller coaster was blown down  twice by high winds and eventually the place was closed.  At the time this film was made, my high school friends and I used to sneak in and explore the condemned site. The 'prarie' referred to by one reviewer is in fact the Salt Flats and old beach area.   I saw this film when one of several efforts to raise money for restoring SALTAIR was in progress.  Arsonists burned the place down eventually. It was a stunninly beautiful place with one of the most beautiful ballrooms of the Victorian Era. We felt it as a huge loss of a city landmark.<br />Other scenes are in downtown SLC: the church where the heroine plays is an Episcopal church where my best friend got married, the water fountain scene is on the grounds of the City and County Building, NOTE the VERY WIDE STREETS! Salt Lake is known for them.  Many of the buildings shown still stand like ZCMI dept. store where the dress scene is taken (you can make out the letters set into the pavement as she exits the store) and Ron Wilson (the tire place with the mechanic) had a Chevrolet Dealership too,  the Union Station (train scene) stands but I'm not certain about the Grayhound Depot (the spot where I departed from SLC 30 years ago (though I return for several visits ayear.) <BR>I loved &quot;Carnival&quot; when I first saw it and I love it now for both the sites and the story. Which, by the way, recalls Ambrose Bierce's &quot;Incident at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;, the French film of which was first aired in the US on The Twilight Zone around the time this film was made.
0345354435|5.0|Right, right, right, Amazon droogs, let me bend your ookos about something for a minoota.  This malchick here's got a couple of bolshie slovos to shazat to you all.  One of the many books in my biblio is A Clockwork Orange written by that Anthony Burgess veck.  It's the story of Little Alex and his droogs who go about shopcrasting, tolchocking other gang members with britvas and nozhes, as well as going on the surprise visit and having a bit of the old in-out, in-out with some hapless devotchka or what not.  His tyrannical ways becomes his undoing and his droogs turn on him.  He is sent to the Staja (state jail) on a murder charge, but that sentenced is commuted in exchange for taking part in \\"this new treatment that gets you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure that you never get back in again.\\"  But is that better than the traditional eye for an eye, as the prison Governor says?<br />The debate between good and evil is the bolshy theme here as explained in this passage comparing goodness and badness as different shops:  \\"If lewdies are good that's because they like it, and I wouldn't interfere with their pleasures, and so on to the other shop.  And I was patronizing the other shop.  More, badness is of the self, the one, the you or me on our oddy knockies, and that other self is made by old Bog or God and is his great pride and radosty.  But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self.  And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?\\"  The self against the machines.  Yes, we saw in the 1960's, my brothers.  But the quote also explains that we are all so full of what Christians call original sin, we want to go into that shop of badness, we enjoy seeing scenes of ultraviolence, people being tolchocked.  After all, it's easier to destroy rather than create, so it's no surprise despite having a decent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.<br />Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good.  The charles says, \\"What does God want?  Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?  Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Or still, \\"in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, [is to have] in a sense really chosen the good?\\"<br />The number of chapters also plays a significant role, like it did in Dante's Divine Comedy.  This book is divided into three sections, each of 7 chapters each.  Seven times three is twenty-one, which is the age at which someone reaches adulthood, and that last chapter was originally taken out of the American release of this book.  That's how the film directed by that Stanley Kubrick chelloveck ended.<br />And that's where I too end, oh my brothers, for a bit of spatchka.  I finish with a tall glass of the old warm moloko, \\"before getting my passport stamped...at sleep's frontier.\\", to spat perchance to sneety, but that's another work altogetherdecent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.<br />Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good.

B000002P7R|5.0|I've never dropped acid, but I imagine this is what it may be like.  Then again, why do I ever need to when there are wonderful mind-bending joyous journies like this album out there.  Hey, not even any danger of a bad trip, right!  I really love the different moods and studio experimentation on this CD, and I think you will too.  Why not try a little Hendrix today?  Its good for what ails ya!
B00005JKN9|5.0|...I saw \\"Gangs\\" in the theatre in late December when it first premiered, and will confess to some initial disappointment, mainly due to the casting, in particular Leo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz.  Both roles, I felt, could have been better cast, and you can pick and choose whom you'd have to play Amsterdam and Jenny, of course.  But some of the casting was surprising--I didn't even recognise Daniel Day-Lewis at first (he'd been out of the movies for a while, apparently, before taking on the role of Bill Cutting) nor Henry Thomas, who plays Amsterdam's closest friend, but both did an excellent job with the roles given them.  Day-Lewis should, in fact, have won the Oscar for his role, as he stole every scene he was in.  Martin Scorsese's directing was, as it nearly always is, just amazing--one of my favourite sequences would have to be the ending, wherein we see the evolving New York City (following Amsterdam's line \\"No one will ever know we were here\\"), from the smoking rubble of the draft riots, through the turn of the century, all the way up to the final, heart-wrenching shot with the Twin Towers standing above it all as if 9/11 had never happened.  As another reviewer said, Scorsese doesn't gloss over NYC's darker history here; the gangs, the riots, the treatment of the Irish immigrants (racism, conscription into the Union Army for the Civil War)...it's all here, in squalid detail.  Definitely recommended.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence's album Fallen is packed full of great music.  There is more to this CD than `Bring Me to Life.'  There are some powerfully dark songs like `Haunted' and `Hello.'  The vocals, the beats and the evocative piano riffs are original and fresh.  When I am in a brooding mood this is the CD I turn to.  It's one of my favorites even though it just came out.
B00005JLYU|1.0|I loved the first one. This one looks like a [bad] ten minute sketch from Saturday Night Live spoofing Hollywood expanded to movie length. I really need a thesaurus to give this movie its true description. I just don't have all the words I need. But, I can start with inane, insipid, incomprehensible, idiotic. What a waste of cuties in this extended music video. It wanders and never ends up anywhere. It reminds me of a couple of stoners let loose in a movie studio. \\"OOooh, we can get John Cleese and Demi Moore. Ooooh, let's put in that Who song.\\"
B000002UR7|5.0|In few words, it doesn't matter if your a Radiohead fan or not, this album is the second best thing in music ever (after the sublime blood sugar sex magic). Forget creep, every single song (giving them a chance) are perfect. The first track \\"you\\" probably my favorite, followed by the beautiful \\"thinking about you\\" give them all a chance, some of them take a while.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The new sure fire hit musical \\"Chicago,\\" will prove that the 2003 movie season will be the best one in a long time.<BR>Sure enough, films like \\"Chicago\\" will start Hollywood's great quest back to stylish and brilliant movies...
0393057658|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I agree with some of the previous reviewers who noted that various aspects of the narrative style are distracting and not particularly well executed.  But the content of the story is compelling and carries the reader through the 300 pages in a breeze.  Additionally, I enjoyed thinking about 'market inefficiencies' as they may pertain to other business and consumer aspects of life in America.  Aren't there many domains in which the 'experts' have been doing things their way for eons and no one questions them?  I can think of several possibilities.  And Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta demonstrate for us how dogged questioning (in the face of stern opposition) and scientific inquiry can bring fresh and new perspectives to light.  I recommend this book and expect that it will be enjoyed by baseball fans (not just A's fans) as well as those curious about how capitalism works in a relatively closed, old-boy network business environment.
B00005OAIE|1.0|In response to the review that suggests that the only reason to hate this album is that John Mayer is a shameless impersonator of his idol, Dave Matthews, I say, you just haven't listened carefully enough.  There are plenty of OTHER reasons to hate this album.  Mayer is whiny pop-soft-rock at its worst.  While I'm no fan of Dave Matthews, I recognize that Mayer, while sharing all of Matthews' faults, shares none of his originality.  Buy something - nay ANYTHING - else.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is definitely far more than the common media may give it attention for.  The lyrics are simple, meaningful (ranging from critics on modern-day political and social practices to simple declarations of love) and blended excellently with the guitar, piano and drum accents commonly assosciated with this type of rock.  Songs such as &quot;Politik&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; question the meaning and relevance of nations, corporations and interdependance as we see it in the world today.  Quaint, sometimes quiet, and always performed to perfection, the album crosses the borders between political, pop, rock and easy-listening.  Never lending itself to one category for too long, Coldplay managed to blend a mixture of each concept evenly throughout the CD, to the point where individual songs seem miniscule in the face of the whole disc.  Certain singles released, such as &quot;The Scientist&quot; &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot; may please the masses, but in all truthfulness only one with a deft knowledge of the world at large will truly be able to realize Coldplay's vision on this album: The complexities of international relations contrasted against the comparative simplicity of love and individual relationships.  A small man in a very large picture, if you will.  For executing this idea so flawlessly, they have attained me as a fan forever.
B000001E8S|5.0|I grew up listening to U2, like bands like The Cure & Depeche Mode, they were the gateway to many bands- though by the time of rootsfest Rattle&Hum, I'd already tuned out...Then suddenly the 1990s occurred and U2 became interesting- the ZOO-TV era that produced Achtung Baby! & Zooropa showed the world's biggest band develop an experimental style, which can be seen analogous to Bowie's 70s Trilogy of StationtoStation,Low&\\"Heroes\\" (forget Lodger) & a precursor of the territory Radiohead would explore from songs like Lucky onwards to albums like KidA. <br />Passengers Original Soundtracks VolI is their most Eno of releases, released under this moniker no doubt to protect the brand-name, it seems undervalued (just one review in the UK) & overlooked: I mean, Kid A is much more conventional. Perhaps it's me, having a taste for perverse artrock- but following this, U2 would deliver the compromised Pop (which flitted between great forward thinking tracks like Mofo&Miami and dull anthems like If God Will Send His Angels & Please) & return to the 80s with the boring All That You Can't Leave Behind (a huge compromise, like REM's Reveal). Only the soundtrack to The Ground Beneath Her Feet would be as interesting as this...<br />Elvis Ate America tells you everything you need to know about the King of Rock&Roll, assisted by HowieB(Tricky's co-writer on Ponderosa), it advances on 93's Numb and predicts 97's Miami. Love the way it almost cuts up elements of Presley's life and then contrasts him with those who had participated in their own destruction (Christ, Hitler, Mishima,Nixon ). Many of the tracks find Eno & co heavily using synths- tracks like One Minute Warning, United Colours & Plot180 deserving a place alongside early Aphex Twin and the critically feted My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Theme from Let's Go Native shows that U2 progressed from b-side Alex/Korova (from The Fly) and songs like Lemon to a very interesting place indeed (this appears to have been heavily influenced by My Bloody Valentine- if Primal Scream did this now, music critics would get very excited...)<br />The Edge takes lead vocals for the minimal Corpse(These Chains Are Way Too Long)- some ghostly industrial beats, a whirring synth, a lone guitar...that's it! Slug does feel very cut up, not quite a song- while Beach Sequence (from the dire Beyond the Clouds: senile soft porn from a once great director) just doesn't last long enough (a blissed out joy). Always Forever Now is a great electronic track, which was perfectly complemented by several Moby tracks when used for the sountrack of brilliant cop thriller Heat (Michael Mann). Theme from The Swan, alternately, finds the Passengers voyage towards the territory of avant-garde composer Michael Nyman- this album cannot be accused of being unimaginative!<br />Eno takes lead vocals for A Different Kind of Blue, while Luciano Pavarotti guests on single (and most perfect song) Miss Sarajevo, which touchingly wonders \\"Is there a time for East17?\\". Love the idea of contrasting a decadent Western lifestyle and celeb bands with the horrors in Eastern Europe- half an hour watching Fox-TV will tell you all you need to know here...Ito Okashi is up there with Tricky's Pumpkin, while another fave Your Blue Room has fantastic bass and harmonics- a real lost U2 classic. <br />Passengers Original Soundtracks Vol1 is a diverse diversion, an album that those with open minds and eclectic tastes should adore- not necessarily U2 fans. It must get boring having to sing Where the Streets Have No Name and being one thing though- a key release of the 1990s, which makes more sense with the passage of time-
B0000033TE|5.0|\\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" is a very difficult album to review in such a small space.  In addition to having top notch instrumentals, there are many levels of thought put into this disc.  The music and the lyrics do really match each other; this is something that most new music is missing.  The music elicits the same emotional response from the listener as does the lyrics.  The opening number sets the listener in one mind frame, and as the album progresses, the listener is transported from a collective history (as seen in \\"Jerusalem\\") to an uncertain and dark future (Karn Evil).  ELP slowly integrates more and more electronic-based instruments in this album, but the human quality is ever present.  The last forty seconds of Karn Evil: 3rd Impression gave me chills.  ELP compressed all that they had been saying throughout the album in 40 seconds.  When I was done listening to this album for the first time, I was amazed, disturbed, and elated.<br />One this has to be said: I hate \\"Benny the Bouncer.\\" It's perhaps one of the worst songs I've ever heard and not in keeping with BSS at all.  I skip over it every time.  With that said, I can't, in good consciousness, reduce the value of this album from a 5 to a 4.  It's a solid 5.  In the end, I asked myself in amazement: \\"Three men produced this much music?\\"
B0000029LG|5.0|i absolutley love this CD. its the most used one in my cd collection. Everybody should learn to appreciate michale jackson and his stlye of music because he isnt going to be around forever and people dont knwo what they are missing out on. he is the best entertainer that has ever lived and this albumn reflects that. all of his songs have a meaning, some more important than others. But each and every one of his songs is unique and brilliant. All those of oyu who are comtemplating wether to buy it or not, i say yes!!! and like elizabeth taylor said \\" michael jackson is the true king of opo and soul.\\" so go out there and buy this CD, you wont regret it
0486211045|5.0|this book is by far the best on figure drawing that i've seen. bridgman is an absolute master of the human form, and he breaks everything down into simple shapes to help even the novice. his realistic and beautiful drawings are anatomically accurate, and quite nice to look at! buy any of bridgman's books, including the brilliant &quot;book of 100 hands&quot;, and you'll be treating yourself to an extremely inexpensive lesson from a true master.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|First of all, no, they are not really lesbian, and yes, it is all a marketing ploy, and oh by the way, Ivan, their producer-manager is well-connected with the Russian mafia and is definitely not a psychologist.  How do I know this?  I am Russian, and I have researched Tatu quite a bit, because I listened to their music and actually liked it.  Their lyrics may be repetitive in English, but they are actually quite complex in Russian.  I think their music is a bit heavy on the Europop, but then, they don't orient themselves as much on Justin Timberlake, as they do on artists from Sweden, Germany and France, so, voila, different standards.  Of course, they don't write their own music (does anyone these days, especially in pop music,) but they are a whole lot less obnoxious than J.Lo or Brittany Spears or the like.  I say, not bad.
B00005JMC6|5.0|I can't imagine a more engaging and generally uplifting movie.  This film is a wonderful mixture of story, character, location and music that slowly lifts you to a sense of wonder and appreciation of the human spirit.  One doesn't usually hear applause at the end of a non-animated movie, but our audience of thirty to sixty-something adults was thoroughly pleased, and spontaneously showed their gratitude for a terrific summer gift.
0316666343|3.0|For this book to even have appeared on the NY Times bestsellers list was impressive, for it to STAY on the list for so long was very impressive.  That was one of the main reasons I wanted to read it...that, and the reviews written here....most of which were glowing.  I was bitterly disappointed in this book, and cannot, for the life of me, understand how it ever made the Best sellers list in the first place.  To me, it had zero depth.  But then, an awful lot of people loved it....they MUST have seen something in this book that I failed to see.  I would advise anyone considering reading this book to do so....everyone's taste is different and you may love it.  Me?  I found it an overlong waste of time.  The closest thing I can compare it to, in depth and interest is a magazine story....OK to read while trapped in a doctor's waiting room....but not worth taking you time otherwise.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones has a beautiful voice, and the instrumentals are perfectly paired with her voice. You may have heard only one or two of these songs on the radio, but the entire disc is good. Sweet, innocuous, and and melodic.
B00008NRLX|4.0|From the chiming first chords introducing Mark Louris' soaring falsetto on \\"Stumbling Through the Dark (Lost Highway),\\" it's clear the sixth effort from the slimmed-down Jayhawks will chart a return to their roots as folk rockers in the tradition of The Byrds. \\"Smile,\\" their 2000 release, found them moving into polished pop/rock with the should-have-been radio hit, \\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me.\\" But it also created an identity crisis for longtime fans weaned on \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" and \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass.<br /> \\"Rainy Day Music\\" brings them back home. Soaring harmonies are everywhere. So are nice touches of banjo, pedal steel, mandolin and keyboards. Just what you'd expect from a Jayhawks disc. The first half of the record compares favorably to the best of the group's work with \\"Tailspin,\\" \\"Save It For a Rainy Day\\" and \\"Angelyne\\" taking their place alongside tasty oldies like \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" and \\"I'd Run Away.\\" \\"All the Right Reasons\\" might be the best ballad the band has produced in half a decade. <br /> Reverberations of the sheen of  \\"Smile\\" show up in two Beatles'-flavored cuts, \\"The Eyes of Sarah Jane\\" and \\"Don't Let the World Get in Your Way,\\" while \\"Madman\\" recalls '80s CSN (which may be good or bad, depending upon your perspective). There are a couple of duds on the disc's latter half.<br /> In the main, though, \\"Rainy Day Music\\" is a promising return to form. I slipped it into the player leaving D.C. on a road trip recently and when the album finished, I hit play again -- and then again for a third time.  It's that kind of disc.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Great movie, great soundtrack. Mysterious, joyous, deep, quiet, soaring, poignant. It's beautiful, truly a triumph for Howard Shore.
B00007GZR5|5.0|If you have seen the movie on VHS but never DVD - you MUST get the DVD version.  There is an alternate ending on the DVD.  It was never used so it wasn't &quot;polished&quot; but it is a wonderful spin.  I like it better than the original ending.  I won't spoil it for you but it is quite a bit longer than the ending actually used and fits better with the rest of the film.<br />The film itself is wonderful.  The bulk of the movie deals with the reality of perception (note, I did not say the perception of reality).  The only subject matter I have seen close to this was in Seth Speaks.  They skirt around God and the actual heaven so there should be no offense. The only reference to God is by Cuba Gooding who, when asked where God figures in on all this, answers to the effect that he's out there watching us.  Chris (Robin Williams) is in his own 'part' of heaven and Annie is in her own 'part' of hell.  The City of Gold can be seen in the distance but is never entered into.  No matter what your religion, you should not take offense (if you do, you are trying).<br />Lovely movie, this is good for all ages.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love this CD, mainly because it has excellent vocal talent, great beats, and terrific messages.

B00005JLYU|5.0|This movie was a feel good time.  Pink put it so perfectly.  The movie had a fun matrix feel to it and it was easy to follow.  Obviously the movie is very predictable; however it was much better than the first one.  It was loud, exciting, mindless fun.  Each angel is great. Camron D. is hysterical and seems to be the head angel b/c she does most of the stuff.  Drew and Lucy Lui are great and fun.  The fashion in the movie is amazing.  Each girl looks amazing in each scene.  Their outfits are amazing.  They wear great boots also.  The clothes would be the one reason I would go to see this movie.  Okay Demi Moore looks good from far away.  In her close ups her skin kinda hangs; it is a little gross.  The movie was fun. Now go see it!!!
B000001Y79|4.0|This CD has a wonderful beat I have not heard before.  All the songs have their own uniqueness yet it is great at the same time.  It is like hearing a mix of rock, pop and something completely new at the same time.  Plus the band writes all their own songs and music.  Buy it!  It is so worth the money and it is one of No Doubts best CD's!
6300213714|5.0|the warriors is one of the best gang movies of all time.It's got friendship,it shows how NEWYORK was back then and how violent gangs were back then.I'm only 15 and I love this movie.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay have managed to continue a string of songs of which there are no lemons.  They have not written a bad song yet, through two wonderful albums.<br />This album is a wonderful blend of the melancholy of &quot;Parachutes&quot; (their debut) and some more upbeat, rock moments.  Though some of the lyrics still contain the sadness and emotion that drew me so thoroughly into &quot;Parachutes&quot;, the music has progressed immensely.  This album rocks the whole way through, it has energy which the first album lacked in parts.<br />It has the feel of a complete experience which almost no bands that are out today have.  The first song, Politik shows the progression of their music right off the bat.  The rock, almost happy go lucky vibe continues and you feel everything singer Chris Martin feels as the music draws you in.<br />The final song &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, is the quietist song on the album,  the whole feeling of the cd is summed up.  Buy this cd.  There isn't much music that is coming out now that is worth your time, but this album definitely is.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This review is for the SACD version of THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. I am not going to attempt to review the music of DARK SIDE, this review is strictly regarding the SACD pressing and mixing. To begin with, I have extensive experience with THE DARK SIDE.  I am of the age where I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out, I have owned it on MOBILE FIDELITY SOUND LABS ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING both on vinyl and on CD, and through my cousin, Mike Licari, I have experienced this musical masterpiece in its original 4 channel (quadrophonic) mix via both quad vinyl as well as reel to reel. So then how does this version stack up to all of the previous versions?It must be remembered that this new SACD version of DARK SIDE is different than all other previous version, hence the name change. Logically, it has a different title and a different cover, so this is a different version. It is not meant to replace the older versions, it is meant to suppliment them. This new version is REMIXED, that is a very important distinction. This version of DARK SIDE was remixed from the original 16-track master tapes that have been in storage at Abbey Road Studios since the creation of DARK SIDE.  This is only the third time that these original 16-track masters have been used, the first was to create the original 2-track master tapes that have been used over and over again to press all of the vinyl versions (including the MFSL version) as well as every CD ever made of this title (including the infamous Japanese Harvest), the second was to mix down the original quadrophonic version so famous in the seventies, and now to create this SACD hybrid version. Therefore tese original 16-track master tapes are comparitably virgin tapes that have been properly stored in vaults at the world famous Abbey Road Studios. Thus, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON on SACD hybrid CD has a brand new mix, which warrants a new title and album cover, as well as a brand new vibrancy that makes this disc just scream withmusic.But this disc offers more than one new version, it offers three new versions. There is the plain old fashioned CD layer that offers a great stereo mix that sounds great due to the care taken in restoring the original music from the original tapes (restoring, not recreating), there is the now famous 5.1 channel mix in beautiful SACD direct stream digital, and there is a fine stereo mix in SACD for all of the audiophiles that can't make the pyschological jump to surround sound. With three versions of this great musical masterpiece, how can anyone fault this disc for its failure to meet your wants. It has everything for everyone. Yes it is brand new, it is not DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, it is THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, and that is the point.For any other questions regarding this disc, please read the great series of articals that are contained in the June 2003 issue of Sound and Vision, which includes interviews with the original engineer.
B000084T18|3.0|50 cent is a good rapper no doubt but he has been overhyped way too much and his songs are played way to much on music channels and stations. But even though that he still has good song with good beats like ''Poor Rich .....'', '' In da Club'', and '' What Up Gangsta'', this album is good but its those type of Lp's that you can only listen to for a month and then sit it down because the songs are played out. As the album goes on it kinda slacks, I think 50 came out to early with this cd and he should have only had 2 single off the LP. 50 also has a bonus track too which is '' Wanksta'' and everyone has heard this song and it has been play on the radio and MTV, BET since October and the LP came out in Feburary.This album is over rated. I would grap this for a cheap price or borrow it from a friend. Surely next time 50's album will be off the chain.
B000000WFF|5.0|Nowadays, in the words 'pop music' comes a very bad connotations. Brought to mind are artists such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. <br />I used to like pop music. It was the big thing, what 7, 6 years ago. <br />The best group, the best female pop group, that emerged from this, never to be topped by the rest of those female groups such as Dream, Play, etc. is the Spice Girls. You could almost say they were the originators of female pop group sensation, and can never be topped. <br />You cant' go wrong with the fun sounds on this cd. Talent, harmony, love of music, and fun. That is what this cd is all about. ALl the rest are lacking in one of these aspects. Rarely comes a 'bubble gum' pop sensation that you can find in your cd case and listen to without cringing. The Spice Girls, however are in that group of elite few.<br />Their cds just bring back so many memories, I suppose.. painful.. cringeworthy memories.. of.... me dnacing.. with my friends *shudder*.. ahh well.. I also remember the fun we had! <br />Let me tell you right now, this cd is worth it. And quite frankly, I wouldn't mind if they came out with another one!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|IF YOU HAVE LISTENED THE FIRST SINGLE AMERICAN LIFE AND AS I DIDNT LIKE IT .<BR>DONT THINK THE WHOLE ALBUM IS ABOUT THAT SONG.<BR>THE OTHER SONGS ARE JUST INCREDIBLE!<BR>I THINK YOU ALL WILL ENJOY INTERVENTION , A SONG THAT EXPRESSES A LOT OF FEELINGS IN EVERY TUNE , ALSO NOTHING FAILS THAT WILL REMIND YOU ALL  THE CLASSIC SONG LIKE A PRAYER .<BR>OTHER HIGHLITES INCLUDE LOVE PROFUSION , I GUESS YOULL HEAR IT ON TV COZ THIS SONG IS GONNA BE FEATURED IN ESTEE LAUDER TV ADS<BR>ALSO HOLLYWOOD WICH IS VERY CATCHY AND WILL BE FEATURED IN TV CAMPAIGNS BEGINNING ON AUGUST 1ST.<BR>ALSO ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL TRACKS IS EASY RIDE , WITH A VIOLIN INTRO AND ARRANGED WITH BEAUTIFUL STRINGS.<BR>I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS CD!
B000002KAT|5.0|I was relucant to buy this album; due to the fact there are \\"no hits\\". I am blessed that I didn't let that stop me!!! <br />Every song is a gem: plain and simple. It blows my mind that this was written and recorded in 1968. <br />This album will speak to your soul. Buy it.
0345457684|2.0|Detective fiction is based upon the accumulation of clues that contribute to a satisfying conclusion--and it works largely because it's set in a world full of conventions, motivations, and details we are all familiar with. The problem with SF detective fiction is that those conventions and topoi do not pre-exist. They have to be established over the course of the story WHILE the author is simultaneously dropping clues pointing toward the final reveal of the story. <br />This is a complex affair, and unfortunately, Morgan spends so much time setting the stage he forgets to hone the script. The world he's fashioned is marvelous, but the little details he provides throughout the story are so insignificant I found myself having to flip back through the book and refresh my memory as to what drug does what and who so-and-so was about every page or so just to make sense of the conclusion.<br />Despite an intriguing protagonist and premise Altered Carbon was ultimately dissatisfying. Most of the supporting cast was one-dimensional with actions that were totally incomprehensible or unqualified, and Morgan also fell into the gland-fulfillment amateur erotica trap that taints so much of science fiction.<br />I'd wait for Morgan's next offering to see if he can tighten things up.
B000002ADT|5.0|I am not a huge fan of jazz, but when I listened to &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;; it took me to a place that few rock albums could take me to.<br />I would give it 10 stars if I could. After listening to this, you will never look at music the same way again.
B000022TSW|5.0|I think this movie is great.  Its definetly better then the TV show, which is saying a lot because the TV show is genius.  I would really recommend at least seeing this movie, if not buying it.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Why haven't you bought this yet?! This is it my friends! The Clash successfully blends punk, reggae, rockability, and a dash of soul; then blows it all up into an album that I would be so bold to say that it is art. <br />The anger and the energy on &quot;London Calling&quot; still cannot be copied today (Although many bands try, they don't come close)<br />See why that this album is on so many &quot;top ten lists&quot;. There are about 19 excellent reasons.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This movie proves it. Freedom always has a price tag. The people who've said that they don't like this movie are too ignorant and short-sighted to see why this film was made. Scorsese set out to reveal a part of our history that many Americans do not know about. It shows how immigrants had to fight to earn their place in America. Men like Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting(to say that Daniel Day-Lewis gave an excellent performance would be a gross understatement) despised all immigrants, especially Irish, and wanted to see them suffer, or leave on the boat they came in on. The immigrants had nowhere else to go, so they had no choice but to fight the 'natives' to earn their freedom in the land of the free. It's a stuggle we still face today. Racial and ethnic tensions are still prominent in 21st century America. This movie is important, because it shows how America became the melting pot of cultures it is today. The movie isn't violent for the sake of being violent. It shows how freedom's price tag is measured in how much blood is spilled. I am a descendant of Irish and Albanian immigrants, so this movie is really special to me. This movie is based on actual history, so for those who don't know much about 19th century America, I recommend digging into the supplements on the DVD. It'll help you understand the history depicted in the film, and it'll help you enjoy it even more. Scorsese's previous films, such as Goodfellas and Raging Bull, are excellent films, but Gangs of New York may be his best film to date. Scorsese was robbed of another Oscar, as was Day-Lewis. DiCaprio and Diaz were great, but Day-Lewis steals the picture. There are a lot of elements in the film, such as the corruption of Tammany Hall and 'Boss' Tweed, the Civil War draft riots, the deplorable conditions of the Five Points, as well as the struggle between the immigrants and the natives, but it's not that difficult to digest all of that information within 3 hours(the film doesn't feel too long, since there's not a single piece of film that lags). There should be more movies like this, which aren't the norm of brainless popcorn 'fun.' There should be more movies like this which are eye-opening and uplifting.<br />Bottom line: Watch it! You won't regret it.e's not a single piece of film that lags). There should be more movies like this, which aren't the norm of brainless popcorn 'fun.'

0688163173|2.0|Maybe it's me because I was expecting something better and read the book with the constant feeling of disappointment and waiting for it to GET better or get SOMETHING.  Dennis Lehane is a popular writer, a friend of a friend, and I was really looking forward to reading his book.  I'm not really good at reading books that delve into other people's minds.  I don't pick up well on subtleties.  I felt as though a lot had happened to these characters before Lehane even started to tell us about them and we were somehow supposed to have ESP.  There isn't much action except walking around a lot and talking even more.  I found the book dull and boring and even flipping to the end to find out what happened made no sense.  I wondered why the book wasn't on the bestseller list, and when I sent it to our library for their booksale, I knew why.
0440224764|5.0|I have never read a novel from cover to cover before, I usually start a book and get bored real early in the story and never have a chance to finish.  The Partner, however, was different. I was hooked all the way through the end.  As the story progressed, I started having more and more questions.  There were so many twists to the story, and the ending was unpredictable.  I hope they make a movie out of this book.
B000001Y2U|5.0|well maybe this album deserves 4 stars...but i gave it 5...cause of the lyrics.....<BR>a lot of fans would say that this is Manson´s best album....i dont agree ....i think that Holywood and Mechanical Animals kick this album´s a**.....The Golden Age just doesnt seems to touch me.....<BR>1.Irresponsible Hate Anthem 8/10-a good start to the album....<BR>2.The Beautiful People 9/10...one of Manson´s best songs...but something is missing there..maybe some guitars:)<BR>3.Dried up,Tied and Dead to The world7/10...kinda weird song....a gothic sound...but not less industrial..<BR>4.Tourniquet 10/10.....My fav song on the album....very good song...<BR>5.Little Horn 8/10.....noizy song..but i like it...dunno why all the poeple says dont like this song..<BR>6.Cryptorchild 7/10....this song wanna be a ballad?:).....<BR>7.Deformography....6/10...weird song..has a groovy sound...more technical....but it´s not for me<BR>8.Wormboy 8/10....another solid work.....i like the irony in this song..Manson doenst makes an effort to sing on this album...<BR>9.Mister Superstar10/10....very good song....now Manson sings about  his wishes...<BR>10.Angel with The Scabbed Wings 10/10....another brilliant song...one of my favourites...i love the lyrics...the gothic rage...and the industrial sound..excellent<BR>11.Kinderfeld 6/10....dont like this song very much....lyrics are good though<BR>12.Antichrist Superstar 10/10.....very very good song...nothing else to say<BR>13.1996 8/10....industrial song...Irresponsible Hate Anthem part 2<BR>14.Minute of Decay 8/10...i like this song a lot...maybe the chorus makes it so cool.....<BR>15.The Reflecting God 10/10.....very cool ...the chorus leaves me without a word against it....it´s a classical Manson song..<BR>16.Man That you Fear 9/10....and finally ..the ballad that ends the hate of the album.....dunno but every Manson ballads puts me very depressive...they are all so...dirty....and calm at the same time...anyway<br />This album could do much more than this...if those guitars wouldnt sound like a broken vacuum cleaner...
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is simply one of the best rock CDs ever recorded. Led Zeppelin are at the top of their game; it has the energy of their early recordings with the sonic maturity of their later years.  You get to sample Zep's whole range of music on one incredible double-disc.<br />Kashmir you already know, and if you're reading into the second paragraph of this review you probably love that track. Bron-Yr-Aur is a beautiful little acoustic guitar piece. The rollicking power of Trampled Under Foot has inspired more hard rock / heavy metal bands than you can imagine.<br />My personal favorite is In My Time Of Dying.  It's a masterful combination of all four bandmembers at their best, and is a powerful 11-minute epic. It also has some of the best slide guitar work of Jimmy Page's career. A close second is The Rover; that riff has gotten stuck in my head more times than I can count.<br />Honestly, you can't go wrong with this album.  So many years later it's still a fresh, intense recording, and holds together incredibly well given the widely varying styles of music from song to song. A must-have!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Words cannot truly do justice to this collection, which is, simply put, awesome. Before this, I was still a Led Zeppelin fan, however I only truly appreciated them for their riff-laden, harder-rocking stuff. After seeing this DVD, I am now one of the biggest Zep fans out there and now truly realize the musical brilliance of these four amazingly gifted musicians. This DVD is both eye-opening and awe-inspiring, that's what it all comes down to for someone such as myself who was born well after Zeppelin had met its end with the tragic death of John Bonham. There are a million reasons to buy this collection, here are the five big ones, in no particular order: 1.Moby Dick - John Bonham's epic drum solo extraordinaire firmly puts aside any doubts that he truly IS the greatest rock drummer there ever was, and likely ever will be. It's no wonder Led Zeppelin had to disband after his death, there's no replacing \\"Bonzo\\". This drum solo is easily the most memorable single section of the collection, it's over 13 minutes of utter freneticism and majesty, as he starts off with the drum sticks, and God, could that man play, but then when he puts the drumsticks down and starts playing a manic solo with his bare hands, you know this is no ordinary drummer...  2. White Summer - whereas Bonzo affirmed his status as the greatest at his instrument with Moby Dick, Jimmy Page proves that he is, if not the best, among the top three guiatarists there ever was, and White Summer is the most memorable showing from him on here, just an incredible guitar solo by Page...not to be missed.  3. Stairway to Heaven - Jimmy Page does an absolutely phenomenal job on the guitar solo here, it far surpasses the legendary guitar solo on the studio version, and that's saying quite a bit, and Robert Plant does an EXCELLENT job singing this one, except for perhaps the last verse or so, but it's still very commendable.  4. In My Time of Dying - improves upon the studio version, if that's even possible. This atmosphere created by the lighting, etc...on stage, creates a epic mood of far more grandeur than if you are not watching it. Also, the memorable riff in the middle of the song is slightly clearer here than in studio.  5. Achilles Last Stand - this is the true gem of the whole package, and worth the price alone. It captures the essence of Led Zeppelin perfectly...inspired drumming from John Bonham, rock solid bass-playing from the much under-appreciated John Paul Jones, charismatic singing from the versatile Robert Plant, and captivating guitar-playing from the incomparable Jimmy Page. Possibly the most epic, the grandest, fieriest song in Zeppelin's catalogue, this is a picture-perfect version of Achilles Last Stand. Of course there are other fine moments on the CD as well, the folk-song trio, with Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp being the highlight of those, and the Dazed and Confused guitar solo, with violin bow, are other great moments, but really, overall, this set is five and a half hours of non-stop magic. Led Zeppelin had a stage presence like no other...Jimmy Page, dancing around with his long black hair, Robert Plant's unimitable strutting around the stage, the tight precision of the music and the grand solos, this was a band that set the bar so high that it is very unlikely any band after them has and ever will come close to holding claim to being as worthy as Led Zeppelin. This DVD collection helps to capture it for a whole new generation such as myself. My only complaint: that this live set of songs isn't also available on audio CD. Yes, How the West Was Won has a portion of them, and I'm sure they are equally admirable versions, however it only captures Led Zep's early half of work, there is no epic In My Time of Dying, or Achilles Last Stand, or Kashmir, or Trampled Underfoot, etc...and it's a shame, so if they would ever come out with a CD version of these live renditions, that would also be a treat for listening on long car trips, etc... Granted, it'd be more like a4 or 5 CD set, but it'd be worth it for sure. Altogether, there is no knock on the DVD set itself, it is a fantastic chronology of possibly the greatest band to ever rock the Earth. Many a heartfelt thanks to the one and only Jimmy Page and company for unearthing this material so that its magic could be shared with all.
B000002J1U|5.0|Although given a mild reception at the time of its release (fans of the first two albums naturally complained about all those folky songs on the second side), in retrospect this became known as one of their strongest and most underrated efforts.  <BR>Certainly no fan of Zeppelin I or II had the right to complain about side one, which upped the ante on the group's hard rock style with all-time classics like &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, &quot;Celebration Day&quot; and &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot;.  &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; is still one of the most perfect hard rock songs ever created, as it evokes a lofty, towering atmosphere of complete untouchability; right from the first seconds of Plant's otherworldly vocal call you know you're in some seriously intense territory.  &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot; has a superb riff that I can never get out of my head, and of course Bonham's thundering contribution is not to be missed.  <br />And, for all the gripe about softening their sound, the acoustic songs are hardly on the order of Crosby, Stills And Nash.  &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; both rock as hard as any acoustic track can, while &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; became a live staple.  Only &quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;That's The Way&quot; have a ballad feel, and these are both a gorgeous, refined change of pace for the band that paved the way for later acoustic material (check out the live &quot;That's The Way&quot; from the Earl's Court show on the new DVD set to see just how powerful this number could be). Then of course there's &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;, perhaps their best slow blues, with Plant at an all-time vocal peak and the whole band dramatically swelling behind him.  The closing &quot;Hats Off To Roy Harper&quot; definitely buts a bizarre spin on what came before, although it is no less effective for that and makes the album one of their most artistic, most heartfelt creations.  The overall atmosphere of this album will remind oneof cold winter peaks and warm picnic days, Viking hordes and old blues singers,<BR>and yet there is a common vibe running throughout all of it that ties it all together.  I would recommend this over all their other albums except &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot;.
B00005JM09|4.0|Terminator 3, all things considered, is a \\"surprisingly good movie.\\" <BR>I would probably rate this movie more accurately at 3.7.<br />There were some elements of the story that required a little thought to understand flow from the previous two movies. Nevertheless, there are still a few loose ends that were not completely evident on viewing the movie. Maybe these will get cleared up when I view the movie again - on DVD.<br />The action is high paced from start to finish. The end of T2 does leave the viewer with an expectation that needs to be addressed in T3. Once past expectations are laid to rest and the strands of this T3 storyline start to intertwine, the movie plays out well. The overall storyline is `darker' than the previous movie, especially the ending.<br />As long as you go into this movie with no preconceived notions or expectations, you will probably enjoy it. Time was taken to try and establish the character of John Connor on this movie. Clearly the sociopath in T2, his character is portrayed as much more of the disillusioned social recluse with perceived expectations of what might happen - if you like - somewhat paranoid.<br />The bottom line for this movie is that it is set as an adrenalin pumping roller coaster and not a cerebral masterpiece and if it as accepted as that and approached with a small level of thought around the storyline, it entertains and is definitely worth the price of entry.<br />The way has been left open for a potential T4 - \\"The War against the Machines\\"??  I do feel that the any future movie will be based on the financial success of T3 and the revenue potential that Hollywood might recognize from another Terminator movie. Nevertheless, you cannot help but feel, as you did after T2 that T3 was in essence a good movie and they should leave the storyline alone and not spoil it.  Time will tell!
B000002J0B|5.0|Ever since the DVD set came out I have been reassessing Zeppelin's back catalogue, and as surprised as I am to admit it, &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; remains their finest effort.  &quot;IV/Zoso&quot;<BR>is, of course, their cornerstone but is simply too overplayed<BR>to bring any kind of fair analysis into the picture.  &quot;Houses&quot;, on the other hand, while still extremely popular has managed to avoid sounding worn-out.  Every song is a classic, although I personally would have replaced &quot;The Crunge&quot; with the superior title track that (oddly enough) found its way onto &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; two years later.  Other than that slight misstep (&quot;The Crunge&quot; is still fun, though), everything else sums up everything that Zep stood for, making this their most rounded<BR>effort.  There's thumping rock (&quot;Dancing Days&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;), guitar epics (&quot;Song Remains The Same&quot;), ballads (&quot;Rain Song&quot;), an occult proggish epic (&quot;No Quarter&quot;), a folk/hard rock fusion (&quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot;) and even a rare bit of reggae-styled humor (the popular &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot;).  Every one of these songs is an FM classic and the overall positive tone of the album made this an overwhelming hit.  Perhaps it is its extreme variety which keeps it so fresh-sounding after all these years, or perhaps it is that not a note is wasted: this remains their one of their least indulgent efforts.  Or perhaps it is because it is also one of their most original achievements, with not a single pilfered blues lick to be found.  Whatever the case, this is one of the top 20 or so best rock albums ever made and deserves a place in anyone's collection, no matter who you are.
B0000636UN|5.0|I love this album! I always liked sheryl crow, although I was never a huge fan of hers. I bought 2 of her other cd's at a garage sale and I thought they were ok. I think the songs they picked to be on the radio on these two cd's were a good choice because I didn't think any of the other songs were any good. I'm talking about the albums, \\"Tuesday night music club\\" and her self-titled \\"sheryl crow.\\" Then I heard the song, \\"Picture\\" and it was more of a soft song and her voice was really pretty. So I thought maybe her newest cd \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" would be more like the song \\"picture\\" and I would like it. So I went out and bought it. And I have no regrets! I love it! All of the songs are good, I can listen to the whole cd with out skipping. I ecspecially LOVE the song, \\"Diamond Road\\"! If I had to pick a song that I wasn't crazy about it would have to be, \\"Weather Channel\\" It's not as nice sounding as the others. It kinda reminds me of her songs on her other albums that didn't get picked for radio. But other than that this album is amazing!! Go out and Buy it!!! Hopefully Sheryl's upcoming albums will be this good. Then I can consider myself a HUGE fan of Sheryl Crow!
B00005JM09|4.0|I already despised this film before I even went to go see it.  How on earth can you have a Terminator film without Cameron or at least 2 of the 3 key actors?  Well, they did just that and it was actually enjoyable.  This film is loaded with humor, not the self-contained kind from T2 but rather a sort of homage to the previous two films.  Sure this is the easy way to do it in a trilogy, but it also has a familiar warmth about it.  And the homages don't just stop at the humor but encompass many aspects of the film.  This does give you the sense that they're running out of ideas, but I highly doubt that.  Most of this was on purpose, though it certainly does cost the film somewhat in the depth department to take this route.<br />There are two aspects of this film that truly make it shine.  First, Claire Danes is an absolutely wonderful actress.  If she hadn't been cast in this role the project would have been doomed.  She brings depth and humanity to a movie that already has us trying to empathize with a robot and another actor filling in someone else's role.  Second, we get a nice take on the other films' mantra of \\"There's no future but what we make for ourselves.\\"  Now, imagine John Conner is a bit of an optimist who simply will not accept the laws of temporal mechanics.  That it'd take his pragmatic wife to make the tough decision to ensure their survival at all costs is a heck of a great idea.  The lengths we learn she is (will be) willing to go through, including allowing the T-101 to lie to her, is a wonderful development on the part of the writers.  The only people who could conceivably have a problem with this is the hardcore Terminator 2 fan, who believes that mantra defines the first two films and throwing it out would simply make a mockery of the series.  But since that's not me, it becomes a plus in my book.<br />I do have some problems with this film, though.  I know the actor who played John Conner before isn't exactly considered very reliable anymore, but getting someone else is at least as bad as being stuck with the other guy.  This other actor is definitely talented, but it's an unavoidable emotional leap and, resultantly, a drawback for the audience.  It feels at times like a soap opera, a franchise that can't be shut down...kind of like ER nowadays.  The actors become interchangable, and that's a shame.<br />Next, there's a scene in an Air Force hanger that is atrocious in almost every way.  Without any sort of earlier set up, we suddenly learn that Danes' character was taught how to fly in the very trainer they're running towards.  All the writers had to do was have her reminisce about her dad teaching her how to fly at some earlier point in the film, and there were plenty of opportunities for this when John and she are just talking.<br />Then we have the T-101's hokey melt down in that same hanger.  The concept of this occurring is perfectly fine, but it's executed in a less than satisfying manner.  Even worse, as John's heading back to the plane he explains (!!!) exactly what we just saw for us with that special oh-so-succinct insight that poorly written \\"informative\\" dialog tends to have.  Simply put, the hanger scene needed major revision and reshooting.<br />Finally, the climax of the film at the blast door doesn't feel very climatic.  When we got there and the intensity suddenly revs back up, I had to think to myself \\"Oh, this must be the climax.\\"  That's never a good sign.  The film actually felt like we had a ways more to go, as the intensity had not properly been built up during the preceding scenes to justify the emotional catharsis of the climax.  This might sound a little intellectual, but it's precisely because it was not quite instinctively and emotionally satisfying during this scene that I'm forced to use the left side of my brain to discuss it.<br />Even with this said, the resolution of the film is satisfying, so all is not lost.  As you can tell I liked the film and am not holding it up toa higher standard than would be justified.  The film is entertaining.  Danes is great.  The humor and homages made me chuckle.  The chase scenes are good.  Sure a lot of the CGI has that soft Star Trek Nemesis look, but the attention to little details like the sand turning into glass from the heat of the time portal made me sit up in my seat.  And last but not least, we get to find out how Skynet was going to be developed whether the original terminator had been sent back or not.  It's not a great film, but considering how low my expectations were I'd say it was definitely worth seeing.  Maybe now they can immediately make a sequel where we see the initial coping with the holocaust and the rise of the resistance up to the climatic sending of the first terminator.  Michael Biehn could certainly be recast for his role, entering the film in the second half.  I'd pay money to see that T4.to a higher standard than would be justified.  The film is entertaining.

B00003CWL6|5.0|This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen and it changed my life forever.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the kind of movie that you just have to smile the whole way through. It's also a film that while not being like the average French film manages to seem quintessentially French/Parisian. The Paris in the film is not the true Paris overidden with the strife of a country and city coming to grips with a poor economy and becoming multi-cultural, but the golden, sun-drenched Paris of old movies, post cards, and honeymoon dreams. The heroine is the 23 year-old lonely cafe waitress who is more at home with her vivid imagination, cultivated over the years to make up for her lack of friends,and stratagems than with people around her. Her good works whether they work(such as the little box of trinkets that starts it all) or whether they flop(like her little matchmaking scheme), they always manage to enchant. Her most amazing stratagem in the whole movie is however the one that could keep her from obtaining the happiness that she has given to others, no matter how briefly. The acting is superb. Audrey Tautou reminded me of another Audrey with her pixie haircut, dark eyes, and heavy eyebrows. She kept Amelie from being an overly cute caricature. All in all a great movie which you'd have to be a curmudgeon to not enjoy.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|With their third release, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST, Van Halen stepped into an era of heavier guitar work. Eddie rips chords like crazy on this record. Released in March of 1980, WACF has some filler, but overall ranks as a very strong release. The opening track, \\"And The Cradle Will Rock, \\" gets your blood pumping. The odd sound at the beggining is actually a keyboard, which the band had been experimenting with at the time, and would play a big part in 1984. \\"Everbody Wants Some!\\" is a wild rocker with Roth ad-libbing between the verses, \\"I like the way that line runs up the back of your stocking.\\" It's hilarious and I listen to this track over and over. \\"Fools\\" takes forver to start up, and has a clunky chorus that gets boring. \\"Romeo Delight\\" speeds things up alot after that and Eddie really shows his pro style on this one.     \\"Tora Tora\\" and \\"Loss of Control\\" are mere fillers to take up space, and do little to show the band's creativity. \\"Take Your Whisky Home\\" changes all that. It's good rocker that starts acoustic before getting heavy. This and \\"Could This Be Magic?\\" are great drinking songs. The latter is a fun acoustic ballad that is fun to play around the campfire. The closer, \\"In A Simpler Rhyme,\\" has heavy riffs along with a pleasant chorus to start and end the track. The filler in the middle of this album along with \\"Fools\\" are the reasons why I ranked it only 3 stars. Other then that, it rocks hard from start to finish. I have a giant poster of the back of this album, and it's an awesome collectors item that I will treasure forever. Pick up this album today and have fun banging your head.
0393312836|5.0|Burgess writes in 1962 a very disturbing book, taking Alex through the experience living as a youth, committing as a member of a gang, burglaries, rapes, and finally being caught by the police. Alex Suffers more than he believes he should have, his friends as traitors, the government experiments, and the crimes he committed in his previous years. Everytime he sees a break, everytime it backfires on him and takes him to more sickness and suffering.<br /><br />Burgess gives his idea of how the future could be, he draws an ugly, may be a reastic picture, of how things work in the modern world. The book could be disturbing from time to time, but it keeps you glued to see how the future would unfold itself.<br />You should have the heart to read such a book, it could be that real.
B000002IZ4|5.0|STP achieved great success with Core, and still continued strong with their second album Purple. The band looked towards other influences for their second album, and the songs were more elaborate and not as one-dimensional like they were on Core, although Core ruled. Their hard rock roots still are evident on Meatplow, Vasoline, and Interstate Love Song, but they dabbled in many other sounds. They wrote some acoustic songs like Pretty Penny and Kitchenware &amp; Candybars (perhaps their most riveting song), and experimented with instruments like the mellotron (the intro to Army Ants), and various percussion instruments. It's hard to say whcih album is better Core or Purple, but both are worth picking up.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I dont think alot of the reviewers get this.  I've written reviews complaining about bad and ignorant reviewers for Radiohead's OK Computer (one of the best ever) and Tool's AEnima.  This one has been at 4 stars for a long time, but please guys. this is an album that you have to grow on, and it takes time.  before you get into this kind of music, do yourself a favor and be prepared for it.  Wilco creates such sonic landscapes and textures, even similar to the soundscapes made on Radiohead's Kid A. The melodies are wonderful, the disc is light and refreshing at times, and saddening in others.  One of the best discs to come out in 2002, and this one is at 4 stars unfortuantely. Such a shame...

B0000024K1|5.0|A storm is brewing...<BR>Just consider the start of this album. You have a recording of the band's gig at London Hammersmith Odeon on the Def Jam Tour. You have claxens and sirens and an ecstatic audience. You have this : \\"London, England...consider yourselves warned!\\". And then you have the fury of 'Bring The Noise'. When politics go beyond sloganeering and instead become the most powerful poetry. Set to the hardest possible beat. \\"Bass!/ How low can you go?/ Death Row/ What a brother know...\\"<BR>'Don't Believe The Hype' is next, a reasoned rant against this band's then-detractors (\\"Clear all the madness/ I'm not a racist...\\")coupled with the absolute refusal to compromise (\\"Again I said I was a timebomb...\\"). And the music. A fantastic groove, a side-to-side style like Sugar Ray Leonard at his finest...<BR>Then we have 'Cold Lampin' With Flavor' where the Court Jester of Flavor Flav cuts loose and provides one of the album's key moments. We are three songs in and we have had three key moments. Unbelievable? Believe it.<BR>Everything about this album sounds prophetic and definitive. Every beat of every lyric on this album is fuelled by Chuck D's  righteously-fuelled anger and those rhymes are then coupled with the all-time DJ of Terminator X whose widescreen wailings/cut-ups lend this album its gravitas. This does, and should, sound like 'Apocalypse Now'. Edge-of-the-seat stuff throughout. And that poetry, that politics. It doesn't dip for a second...This is certainly one of the best 20 albums ever recorded, possibly one of the best 10.<BR>'Louder Than A Bomb' has the FBI tapping Chuck D's telephone - I think it's accepted that this happened - and the resultant furious poetic anger :  \\"Your CIA/ You see I ain't kidding...\\".<BR>The pace doesn't let up, the power of this music doesn't let up, the power to excite and affect doesn't let up. And bearing in mind how quickly hip hop moves on, this hasn't dated at all...<BR>Okay. All great music is personal and this is mypersonal defining moment concerning this album : it is 1987, I am listening to the John Peel Show and he plays 'Rebel Without A Pause', the first time I hear it, and I am literally dumbfounded. And as excited by music as is possible. What is this? Well, the feeling, the vibe, the knowledge that I had just heard something so exciting, so new, so fully-formed...It is a track that is still comfortably in my Top Ten tracks of all-time. And that moment, the rock 'n' roll moment when those sampled drums crash in amidst that cacophony and Chuck D says \\"We're on a mission, y'all...\\"<BR>They were. They are. That's all you need to know...

0440237688|5.0|A fable in which the \\"perfect society\\" has eliminated all conflict by eliminating things like color, music, and most things about which one could be passionate. The young boy coming of age discovers these things and tries to break away. It's a good story to get kids talking about what matters in life. What is worth fighting for. That all conflict is not bad. That passions make life worth living.  Provocative.
0385504209|5.0|The DA VINCI CODE is as layered as an onion. The imagination that author Dan Brown has revealed through his decision to write this story is beyond ordinary comprehension. The plot he has constructed, revolving around millenia old secrets, combined with the quantity of detail he provides and the depth of his research, is &quot;awesome&quot; in the most literal sense of the word--and &quot;awesome&quot; is exactly the appropriate word to describe this novel. The plot is as layered as an onion, the clues he offers are elusive and tantalizing and, ultimately, all but impenetrable.<br />This is one of the best books (if not the best book) I've ever read. Appropriately, there are many who would remind me that it's the second best book, after the Bible. Well, THE DA VINCI CODE is, in many ways, a further exploration of the Bible.<br />A warning: Don't start this book unless you have the time readily available to finish it. Once you get into the story, you will not be able to put the book down until you read the last page!
B00005N5S5|5.0|Before there was The Matrix and a dark vision of the future with machines dominating humanity there was The Terminator!  With its dark vision, extraordinarily well laid out plot and \\"Arny\\" starring as the bad guy, this film was destined to succeed.  Not only was there an outstanding script, written and directed by James Cameron, but those starring in the film made it the success that it is and only to be matched by its sequel.<br />The Terminator is James Cameron's first film and arguably the best film of his career.  While \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map, The Terminator put him in the dead center of the map and launched him on a streak of highly successful action movies.  It was extremely interesting to watch a couple of the Special Features and find out that James Cameron and crew were basically putting this outstanding sci-fi classic together on a shoestring budget!<br />The great thing about Arny in this movie is that he didn't even have to say much, he just had to be cool and it worked perfectly for him.  Linda Hamilton performs admirably as we see her character go through the change from the shy and sheltered young woman to the somewhat hardened heroine by the end of the film.  Michael Biehn's performance as the sacrificial hero of the film is perfect!  Along with the outstanding leading cast, look at the secondary characters, to name just a couple, Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield.  Even one of James Cameron's favorites, Bill Paxton has a small role in this extraordinary film.<br />The more interesting aspect of this film when put in the light of the first two films and the third one that's in the theaters now is from a story standpoint where this first film is just the first paradox of the many that come about throughout the films, raising several \\"what ifs\\" about the \\"whole\\" story!<br />The premise:<br />We're brought into the film brilliantly as we see The Terminator make his trip through time, showing up and not taking any \\"no\\"answers to his request for the clothes of a young punk!  We're then taken to Sergeant Kyle Reese's time jump and a consequent search for clothes as well, but he's not so lucky and is immediately set upon by the police.  Jumping forward a bit, the Terminator has made his move and Reese has stepped in to try and save Sara.  While they're running from the Terminator and the police at the same time, some of the most imaginative filming in the history of film is going on as the scenes cut to the dark future of the early twenty first century and the machines are attempting to eradicate humanity.<br />I highly recommend this outstanding science fiction classic to all who haven't seen it yet, for it is truly one of the best films in the history of the genre and well worth repeated viewings.  I've watched this film many more times than I can remember but it was certainly great to see it in the widescreen DVD format, something I haven't seen since this film was in the theaters.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />Other Voices - A documentary that includes a new James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger Interview.<br />The Terminator:  A Retrospective documentary<br />Several deleted scenes with commentary<br />Theatrical trailers<br />And several other interesting special features
B000068CNX|3.0|The episodes are great, and I love the fact that it will play all the episodes straight through, but there are no individual chapters in each episode. If you try to skip to the next chapter, you go to the next episode. Therefore, you have to fast-forward through the entire episode if there is a specific part you want to see. The lack of effort in creating the dvds is obvious.
B00004TRD8|5.0|It is absolutely amazing to think that \\"The Terminator\\" was made on a shoestring budget of \\"only\\" $6 million, where the filmmakers were literally sleeping on couches and living off of coupons from McDonald's to making the transition to \\"Terminator 2 - Judgment Day!  Taking that into consideration and then looking at the over $150 million dollar budget for T2, which was the first of its kind, one can only sit back in awe at the silver screen masterpiece that was created by that budget.  <br />With \\"The Terminator\\" being James Cameron's first feature film and the film that went far beyond \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" in launching Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the demand for this sequel was constant and finally overwhelming, leading them to begin it's filming in 1990.  The final outcome of that filming and budget being one of the highest grossing films to ever have been made, to date of which, the film has earned nearly a billion dollars, which is simply astonishing!<br />From a personal standpoint, when this film made it to the silver screen, I believe I went and saw it at least two times and I even read the book that was released concurrently with the film.  The VHS tape release of it was rather worn out as well due to this being such a compelling and captivating story!<br />The premise:<br />Enhancing upon the basic story and theme of the first film which was the first of many paradox's within this plot, director James Cameron brings us forward approximately ten years.  We're brought to the Terminator's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) introduction as he does essentially the same thing he did in the first film, seek clothing and weaponry.  From the very beginning of this film you see that it still has the same dark undertones of humanities future struggle against the machines but at the same time its going to have a different style as there is some humorous scenes right up front.<br />From there we're taken to the T-1000's (Robert Patrick) introduction in the film.  At this pointin time, the viewer who hasn't seen this masterpiece before doesn't quite know which of the Terminators is going to be the bad guy.  From there we're taken to the introductions of John Connor, played rather well by Edward Furlong and then his mother Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton reprising her role from the first film.<br />It doesn't take one long to figure out that this is a big film and that the action is going to blow you away whether you're seeing it for the first time or the tenth time.  Few films of this genre even come close to comparing to the scale and scope that is T2 Judgment Day!  Everything about this film from the script to the actors and their acting to the makeup and the soundtrack all screams box office smash hit!<br />As you can surmise, I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of the genre and fans of superb scriptwriting played out to perfection on the silver screen.  {ssintrepid}<br />T2 Judgment Day Ultimate Edition Special Features<br />Documentaries:<BR>- \\"The Making of T2\\" Featurette<BR>- \\"T2:  More Than Meets the Eye\\" Featurette<BR>- \\"The Making of T2: 3-D\\" Breaking the Screen Barrier\\"<br />Special Features:<BR>- Supplemental Materials - Several features which cover every aspect of the film.<BR>- Cast and Crew Information<BR>- Trailers and Teasers<BR>- Entire Screenplay<BR>- Over 700 Storyboards<br />DVD-ROM:<BR>- An excellent DVD-ROM feature that allows you to view the film and the script at the same time.<br />Other Features:<BR>- An outstanding metal enclosure for the DVD case.<BR>- A thirty page booklet with even more information about this incredible film.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is an excellent, compelling, intelligent thriller, one that grabs you from the first page, one that you won't be able to put down.  Robert Langdon is called in for questioning regarding a violent murder at the Lourvre one night.  The clues left by the victim, the museum's curator send Langdon and the victim's granddaughter, Sophie, on a quest to solve both the murder and the story behind the clues the curator has left.  The story is smart and well-paced and it will keep you guessing.  An excellent, thrilling read.  Enjoy.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Austin Powers in Goldmember is like nothing youve ever seen before (except in the first two films, of course) Its a safe bet that whether youre a fan or hater of the original films, Goldmember will inspire the same reactions. Its a hit-and-miss affair that loaded with gross-out gags, phallic symbols, and celebrity cameos (some of them actually become small roles). Like its predecessors, this film pushed more than a few buttons with the MPAA .<br /> Should I bother with the plot? Nah. There are plenty of more comprehensive reviews with plot-synopses  for those who... *ahem* really care about that kind of thing in this sort of film. Lets just say that Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and the despicable Fat B*stard. He also takes on the character of a Dutch madman named Goldmember. If you thought Fat B*stard was foul, wait till you see what this guy does. Or rather, look through some sort of fabric to lessen the impact.<br /> A lot of the stuff in here, even though it pushes the boundaries of taste far beyond the weak PG-13 rating, is gut-bursting. But there is also so much of it that falls utterly flat that I cant quite give it a solid recommendation. But Im not surprised that a majority of the student population  find it the summers funniest comedy. Hey, with the way comedies have been going these past few years (Corky Romano and Kung Pow: Enter the Fist) if it makes you laugh like this one does, then to hell with taste.<br />And with that, I have opened Pandoras Box.
B00005JM03|5.0|The Italian Job, which has been compared to Ocean's Eleven and The Bourne Identity, goes way above and beyond these films in pure summer entertainment. Whereas Ocean's Eleven was dragged out in some places, TIJ is beautifully edited with no \\"check your watch\\" scenes. And The Bourne Identity had a great car chase scene with a mini-car. The Italian Job has three!<BR>And let's not forget the plot. It's smart, with real emotion penetrating the layers of style. It twists, which is always nice :). And you feel like you can connect with the characters, which is something that doesn't often happen in an action/heist flick. Don't miss this one.
B00000I07R|5.0|This CD was the first Bon Jovi CD I bought, and may I say.... first impressions definately last! Keep the Faith is a CD which first defined Bon Jovi as world class music material. From the roaring opening of \\"I Believe\\" to the haunting love scene of \\"Bed of Roses\\" and the soul lifting conclusion of \\"Little Bit of Soul\\", these enigmatic journey of songs certainly spell out the message of keeping the faith on what you beleive in. This is not to say that the whole album is only about faith, and low key songs on its behalf. The true Bon Jovi high-octane anthems are present in all their glory. \\"I'll Sleep when I'm Dead\\", \\"Woman in Love\\", and \\"Blame it on the love of Rock & Roll\\", remind fans who are closely linked to their previous albums that Keep the Faith comes as a complete package. It is like a wild party filled with hope, a faraway love giving a pain in your heart, and a reminder that we are not born to die, but are born to live. This CD is definately a must have for people of all music genres.
B00009L1TA|3.0|\\"Basic\\" is anything but basic. My head spinned a million times and I aged ten years. There were so many plot twists and liars (or people who don't know what the word \\"truth\\" means). Tom Hardy (John Travolta) was an Ex-Ranger turned DEA agent who was brought in by an interrogator (Connie Nielsen) to see what really happened during Sgt. Nathan West's (Samuel L. Jackson) training session. There was also way too much rain. You could hardly hear anybody talking. The ending was ridiculous and made me want to slap somebody's face. Ultimate deception! The theme song of the movie should've been Avril Lavigne's \\"Complicated.\\"
B00005JKZV|5.0|Have both read the book and seen the movie and, wow, what an awesome transition from written word to screen.  Yes, there are differences which the purists may not like but the basics are the same, the cast is fantastic, the scenery incredible so I can live with the changes.  I can hardly wait for the DVD, have almost played out The Fellowship Of The Ring and am taking the day off to see The Return Of The King.  I had not previously read the trilogy, saw TFOTR prior to reading the book but knew I had to read them all after that. These movies are the best whether you are a Tolkien fan or not.<br />C'mon August 26th!
B000067J24|4.0|Self-described &quot;straight&quot; men (who make up a startling number of movie critics) love to disparage a movie like this by calling it a &quot;chick flick.&quot; &quot;No car chases, no explosions, no video-game special effects, no grisly deaths, so could it REALLY speak to me?&quot; In fact, &quot;Woman on Top&quot; is a &quot;woman's picture&quot; on many levels: directed by a woman (Fina Torres), written by a woman (Vera Blasi), and starring gorgeous Penelope Cruz, who takes close-ups like a '40s screen goddess. One might wonder, would it not have been more appropriate to cast a Brasilian in the role of Isabella? Any objections about casting Ms. Cruz as a Brasileira are soon overcome as you watch her performance. This is a sensitively-written, beautifully-photographed, perfectly-scored, and exquisitely-acted film about one woman's search for her locus of control and comfort. Isabella Oliveira (Cruz) searches for her centre of control geographically (Bahia, Brasil and San Francisco, USA) as well as emotionally (exerting control over her destiny, achieving success in her career, choosing her best romantic prospect). The soul-searching the character undergoes is completely believable, thanks in no small part to Cruz' natural, understated performance. Director Torres also gets wonderful performances from Murilo Benicio (who plays the impossibly handsome Toninho), Harold Perrineau Jr (as the outrageous Monica), and Mark Feuerstein (as smarmy but completely adorable television producer Cliff). Benicio finds the right combination of physical presence and wounded Latin pride to make us cheer for his character, but we end up also caring for each of the main characters. It's another variation of the classic fish-out-of-water shtick, or perhaps more like siri-out-of-moqueca (in keeping with the Bahian theme). Bahia is portrayed as exotic and sensual, but San Francisco is also exciting and full of opportunities. The notion of the &quot;exotic&quot; is toyed with here, as the Big Hollywood Phonies want to make the Isabella personage less &quot;ethnic,&quot; which is the galvanizing moment for the character's identity on many levels. She changes, as she must, but remains fundamentally &quot;herself,&quot; just more in control of her life. Upon her arrival in America, Isabella is asked by San Francisco's one cabdriver (or so it seems), &quot;What planet are you from?&quot; Isabella's reply: &quot;Brasil.&quot; This film is rich in irreverent humour, gorgeous music, believable dialogue, and cute little touches (the Asian 411 operator, the Caribbean cabbie, the caprices of Iemanjah, etc). The ending feels so right, so natural, it makes the entire experience of viewing this film all the more rewarding. I would highly recommend this film to lovers of warm-hearted romantic comedies, or even just good &quot;chick flicks.&quot; An absorbing and worthwhile film.
6305014140|5.0|When the word &quot;anime&quot; comes to mind, this movie follows right behind. Whether you watch anime or not, this is not only good but worth putting in theatres. If you only see one anime if your life, this should be it. -Casey
B00005N5S5|4.0|In 1984, a young woman's life is about to change in an unbelievable way.  Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a girl trying to make it in the world when all of the sudden, a man and a machine appear in her life, one trying to kill her, and one who will do anything to protect her.  Kyle Reesce (Micheal Bein) is a soldier sent back through time by Connor's unborn son John who's mission is to stop a T-800 series Terminator (Arnold Can't-Spell-His-Last-Name Schwarzzenegar) from killing her, thus killing John.  John is the leader of the human resistance against an army of hostile machines that have nearly destroyed the human race.  The Terminator is a state-of-the-art machine with living human tissue surrounding a metal endoskeleton that feels no pain, no pity, and will never stop until Connor is dead or it is destroyed.  For such a low budget, this movie is very well done.  The story is very well-written, the actors are great, especially Arnold, and for the money they had, the special effects aren't too shabby.  In fact, this movie was so well-received that it granted its sequels the two highest budgets in film history.  This is a classic sci-fi movie that won't disappoint.  Oh, speaking of classic, look for all of the old 80's fashions, just for fun.
B00005JKBC|4.0|It's Nathan Muir's (Redford) last day at the CIA, and his former protege, Tom Bishop (Pitt), has gotten himself caught by the Chinese trying to break someone out of prison.<br />So begins this interesting movie that goes through the history of Muir teaching Bishop the \\"rules\\" of how to live through a career running operations at the CIA.<br />Unlike the typical \\"spy flick,\\" this one doesn't involve Muir fighting off a succession of sexy chicks in order to triumph over some chortling villain.  He never leaves the office until the very end.<br />It is entirely entertaining to watch Muir explain his \\"rules,\\" only to, on his last day, break them, one by one.<br />Even more entertaining, in a rewatch, is to try to figure out just how many times he speaks bald-faced lies, and, better still, how often the people lied to choose to accept the lies, even when they know better.  There are numerous occasions where his rescue attempt could have unravelled if someone found it in their interests to poke holes in his lies.<br />It's a bit of a period piece; Muir is one of the bloody-handed \\"operational guys\\" from the days when the CIA was pretty clear about their need to act on the world stage.  His successors are nowhere near as clearly bloody-minded, as the CIA has since moved  into more of an \\"analytical\\" model.  Of course, a Bishop, dead in a Chinese prison, is as dead whichever group leaves him to die...<br />Also interesting is that Muir presents a pretty strong apologia for doing bloody deeds.  His character believes that, nasty or not, they are doing needful things.  It is by no means clear that the successors have any better ethics than he had.<br />The stories about ex-wives keep popping out of the woodwork, supplying considerable humorous material.  The REAL story emerges only at the very end, leaving no time to reflect on Muir's REAL character.  He behaves throughout as one who well deserves to have wives leaving him, in droves.  Reality is that all anyone sees, most ofthe time, is the facade that Muir wanted them to see, and it's worth reflecting on how different his internal reality is from the impressions you start with.<br />At the end, the story is a pack of lies, with a few flashes, here and there, of Muir's REAL character.  In a sense, he is a failure, since he only rarely gets to express his real beliefs.  This is a little like the \\"About Schmidt\\" character, who, after years of hiding his true desires, completely fails to express the things he believes truly important.  <br />But unlike Schmidt, Muir does have enough courage to act on his convictions to actually make some difference.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Besides being one of the best, this is also one of the most important rock records of all time.  Without the Ramones, there'd be no Green Day, Blink 182, Used, Thursday, or Pennywise (just to name a few).  The Ramones invented punk rock.  Period.  The Stooges, the MC5, and the Velvet Underground were just paving the way for punk's birth.  This was the first punk record, released in 1976.<br />All of the songs on this record take catchiness, speed, and fun to the EXTREME.  This album truly stands the test of time and is always an entertaining listen.  All of the songs have literally irresistable hooks and will have you singing along before you can say \\"Hey! Ho! Let's go!\\"  There is not one dull track on the entire album.  Besides being insanely catchy, the songs are (unintentionally?) hilarious.  Who else could include lines like \\"I used to make a livin', mon, pickin' the banana/Hooray, for Havana!\\" into songs besides the Ramones?  On the other side of the spectrum, songs like \\"Listen to my heart\\" and \\"I wanna be your boyfriend\\" have genuine emotion behind them, something lacking from practically all bands of today.  All these factors are part of their genious.  Many people dismiss them as dumb, untalented, or bubblegum pop, but the Ramones knew this and made it into a winning formula.<br />If you're a punk fan, this had BETTER already be in your collection (if not, go buy it now and spare yourself the humiliation), or if you're simply a rock fan who's never heard of \\"da bruddahs\\", give them a shot.  I guarantee you won't regret it.<br />If you're looking for a good time, I give this album my highest recommendation.
076780421X|5.0|While Matthew Perry and all of his supporting cast certainly make this comedy fun and entertaining, it is also surprising how well written it is.<br />Generally, there seem to be 2 basic formulas for romance stories in movies. The first formula is for a couple to start off disliking each other and end up loving each other. The second is for the couple to meet, be tested by an adversity, overcome it and live happily ever after. And one thing these two formulas share in common too often is the rush to have sex. That's where this movie comes in. It turns these formulas on their ear.<br />In a way, this movie makes fun of the cliche' formulas of romantic movies.<br />While trying not to give anything away, \\"Fools Rush In\\" reverse engineers the process of building a lasting relationship.  In so doing, I couldn't help be think about my own relationships and wonder if I've taken all the steps and covered all the bases myself.<br />The movie addresses in a delightfully funny and entertaining way some of the many of the major decisions couples need to work out, such as: how they will mitigate cultural differences, how they will work out career conflicts, where they should live, when to have children, what to do with well-meaning but medling friends and family...<br />This really is a surprisingly insightful romantic comedy; I have no regrets for purchasing it and I doubt you will either.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Sometimes I spend too much time watching movies of heavy mental baggage. Films like Amores Perros or Goodfellas are indeed excellent pieces of cinema, but I cannot watch them forever. Watching movies that are dark and depressing often make me dark and depressing, and I temporarily develop a \\"glass-half-empty\\" attitude, failing to see the good in anything; a petulent pessimist. When I see this storm cloud appearing on the horizon, I tend to indulge in a \\"lite\\" movie; usually a comedy or action film to \\"cool\\" my proverbial \\"jets.\\" Often I don't expect these coolents to be terribly entertaining or satisfying, but every so often a very good movie will come along and punch me in my big prejudice face. Die Hard is one such movie.<BR>It's a shame that action/adventure films of this calibur have been replaced with uncharasmatic meathead Vin Diesal throwing his fat face about some exotic location with computer altered/enhanced special effects dancing around him. Action movies today have weak story lines, miserable main characters, and rely so heavily on computer enhancements that whatever gems the generally mediocre genre could produce have been buried in the sands of time. Maybe when the public wakes up from the Hollywood Sandman's magical sleep powder and realizes that Vin Diesal is, in fact, a horrendous actor with no onscreen presence, we can see some entertaining action films once again.<BR>But, I am supposed to be writing about Die Hard, and Die Hard is what I shall write about. The movie has every element required to bake the pie that is a very good action movie. Die Hard possesses an actor with natural charisma, Bruce Willis, who is close enough to a human being (as opposed to the \\"Mutant from Planet Muscle\\" look possessed by 'Aanald') that the audience can feel some relation with him. There is a good script, and while it won't win any pretentious arthouse adulation, it is good enough to keep theatergoers entertained for the duration of the two hour movie. Die Hard is given a strong supporting cast, which is in other words Alan Rickman, who gives a solid performance as the diabolical arch-villian (although Carl from Family Matters holds up decently as well). Finally, we are blessed with very fine direction John McTiernan, who keeps us on the edge of our seats for all 130 minutes.<BR>Die Hard is filled with plot twists and surprises, that even surprised me, loyal reader. The firefights and full-contact brawls are intense and suspenseful. One doesn't really think about the fact that Willis will survive every struggle he encounters, for the film is engaging enough to really get you caught up in the fight; gasping and jumping and rooting for Willis to knock the man's teeth in.<BR>The dialogue, while somewhat corny, is still passable. Willis will say some relatively bad lines throughout the course of Die Hard, but what is an action movie without the macho, campy dialogue?<BR>The ending, while a little on the corny side, somewhat damages the film, but not so much as to ruin it. It's difficult trying to critique an action movie, because basically, it's there to keep me entertained, and that's what it does. Go out, rent the damn thing, and escape for awhile. It's a very fun, engaging, suspenseful flick, and you will not be dissapointed.
B000099T2L|4.0|i gave this cd a 4 out of 5 because there were some pretty dayum good beats to listen to on here. my fav songs are, crazy in love, naughty girl, be with you, me myself & you, yes, speechless, dangerously in love 2, gift from virgo, daddy. a lot of the songs are really good..so this is worth every penny!!!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is a smashing new hit for the Godsmack dynasty. The new drummer gives a big hit to the band with his talent. He is much better than the old one. This CD inspires me so much in my whole life with everything the lyrics say. If you haven't gotten this CD yet what are you waiting for!! Go and buy it here or at another store, but just buy this CD NOW!!
0688163173|2.0|I know I was supposed to be be flipping pages wildly, with my hair standing on end, but I really couldn't get that immersed in the story.  But, Shutter Island was foisted on me, and I stuck through to the end because the foister just might give me a pop quiz.  Shutter Island isn't a bad book, it's just isn't my kind of book. I call books like these \\"hat tricks,\\" or maybe talking horses.  Real live book reviewers call them great \\"gotcha\\" books.<br />Lobotomies and withdrawing from Tofrinal aren't really very terrifying or interesting.  And Teddy or Andrew?  Well, I couldn't seem to care.  For real terror, I vote for The Horned Man.  Shutter Island?  It'll make a great movie after it's made a gob of money in book form for the smiling man of the back flap.
B00000G3PA|3.0|I know most disaster movies don't focus to much on science, but this movie had some flaws that were quite noticable. <br />1. The killer asteroid is said to be the size of Texas, but there are no asteroids that big that we know of<BR>2. The asteroid that hit Paris would have been more than enough to wipe out man kind<BR>3. The small meteors that hit New York would have burned up in the atmosphere before they even reached earth, and if some survived they would be to small to cause any damage<BR>4. The asteroid doesn't even look like one. A large asteroid would just be a large rock. It wouldn't have all those spikey rocks and other chunks of rock<BR>5. At the beginning of the movie, it says that the asteroid that killed the dinsoaurs struck with the force of 10,000 hiroshima bombs. That isn't even close. The asteroid that killed the dinsoaurs was close to about 1 billion hiroshima bombs<BR>6. WAn asteroid of that size wouldn't just leave a crater,it would split the earth in two<BR>7. If the scientists discovered an asteroid 700 miles across 18 days before it would hit earth, they must not have very good technology <BR>8. The small meteors were even smaller in space than they were when they hit New York. Did they have a growth spirt in the atmosphere? <br />This movie wasn't that bad but more science could have been put in to it.
B000035P80|4.0|I watched this film after just starting to get turned on to the music of Bob Dylan and was shocked at how good this was.  Most of what you see behind the curtain's of concerts and of the daily lives of singers now are closely scripted.  You will never see anything like this film on MTV, it is real unscripted ?fly-on-the-wall glimpse of one of music?s most influential figures,? says the box of this film.  Britney Spears or any of the so-called artist MTV shoves down America's mouth will never be shown yelling and swearing over glass in the street.<br />This film shows Bob's manager cursing and threatening a hotel worker, Bob Dylan yelling and going crazy over someone throwing glass(very funny), Great concert footage and footage of Bob singing in hotel rooms, Bob making the press look stupid, Bob's sly manager milking BBC people for every dollar in order to get Dylan to perform for them, Dylan completely ignoring Joan Baez as she sings, Dylan making jokes about Donovan, Dylan smoking every second, Dylan's card video for Subterranean Homesick Blues, Dylan being swarmed by fans and screaming for people to get a girl who jumped on his car off, Bob meeting a crazy old lady who acts like she is someone big in England and shows off her power by telling Bob and his friends to stay at her mansion (very strange), Bob obsessing over what number his songs are on the charts and what his picture looks like in the paper, so on and so on. <br />Just buy this movie if you like Dylan, if your just starting to like him, if you never heard of him.  It is a welcome relief from today's bad music with overly scripted artist who can't play instruments and who don't write the words to the songs they sing.  After watching this you?ll want to download all of Dylan?s songs.
B00003CXTG|2.0|When I first saw Armageddon, i thought it was going to be a good disaster movie with plenty of action, but all it really was was Ben Affleck smooching someone. That is the same with Pearl Harbour. There is hardly no action, all there is, is romance and Ben Affleck asking a girl to go out with him. I wish some studios would trash the romance and put some mroe work into the disaster seens.
6303454488|2.0|I just came across the great music of Bob Dylan a few weeks ago I have since downloaded many of his albums and bought the famous D.A. Pennebaker film Don't Look Back, a great film with the amazing music of Bob Dylan at his best still playing without a band.<br />Bob Dylan Unplugged is Bob Dylan at his worst that will actually make you feel sorry for him.  Unlike Johnny Cash who is able to use his aged voice to bring power to his songs Dylan just sounds like he needs to get out of music.<br />It is amazing how silly he sounds singing the words of Desolation Row and The Times They Are A-Changin'.  These great sounding songs with great lyrics are not only sung horribly but thrown into an electronic mess of sound with Dylan sounding comical with a voice worse than anything you will ever hear.  Like a Rolling Stone is almost funny on this film, you don't think about the words you think about Dylan's horrible voice and him changing it every few lines.<br />Usually for a bad concert tape you would say ?buy this only if I was a diehard Dylan fan.?  I am a diehard fan.  I say only buy this horrible film if you hate Bob Dylan and want to laugh at him.
0440217563|2.0|Basically speaking, this book is not as good as the first two by far. A lot of the excitement and freshness of Jamie and Claire's relationship is not there, and I found myself getting annoyed with many aspects of the book. Overall I would recommend this book for anyone who simply loved the first two, but do not expect the same power from this novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone who thought Dragonfly in Amber was just okay. Reading this book will not add anything special for you.
B000001IQH|4.0|This is an awesome cd! I could end the review with those simple words, but I'll go into a little more detail! Anyways, this is definitly not my favorite rancid album. Rancid 2000 and Life Won't Wait have to be the best! I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5 because it is not heavy enough! As a street punk fan, I don't care much about the lyrics or melody. The heavier and faster, the better! However, I found myself liking slower songs such as the ska single Time Bomb and the amazing Roots Radicals. I like the later half of the cd alot! Form song 13 to the end are all great! They are sometimes heavy and sometimes packed with lay-back ska! Overall, this is an awesomne cd that any punk or Rancid fan should own! If you are a fan of TIm Armstrong, I suggest listening to The Transplants. Well, for now, enjoy this amazing album!
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is the type of movie that you have to see over and over again to really appreciate. It gets so much funnier every time. Jeff Bridges is a complete loser living in Los Angeles who manages to get himself caught up in wheeling-and-dealings with the upper tier, and at the same time, never just takes everything that comes at him with hardly a flinch. The Coen Brothers manage to take the wierdest characters and situations and twist them around to make them very very funny.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I can't express how much I love this album! In the past 3 days, I must've listened to it 7 or 8 times! Some songs experiment a little and change from Nofx's signature sytle, but that's why I love this cd! Some people are afraid of change, so they don't like this cd. Well, they're all wrong! Just trust me on this, and go buy this cd! The best songs would have to be &quot;She's Nubs&quot; (which is a funny song about a girl with no legs or arms) and &quot;Seperation of Church and skate&quot; (which is about how punk music is getting too safe now a days). Well, that sums it up! Nofx has been around for about 20 years and they still play better than ever!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|When Alanis Morissette released her breakthrough album in 1995, \\"Jagged Little Pill,\\" practically the whole world stopped and watched this angst-ridden vixen whine to us. The album, in other words, was a phenomenal success. It sold near to 30 million units worldwide, and topped the UK album charts for 21 weeks over the course of two years while spawning some massive international hit singles. Three years passed between the release of this masterpiece, and expectations were extremely high for the follow up. It arrived in November 1998, and was titled \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.\\"<br /><br />So did it impress the public? Well, no. The album sold a mere 7 million copies - a significant drop from the previous release, but the fact remains that here we have a truly classic record. While Jagged Little Pill often lashed out in an angry state, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is more about reconciliation - with her lovers, friends, parents, and with herself.<br /><br />The album opens with the amazing two songs \\"Front Row\\" and \\"Baba.\\" The former is an excellent opener, and an album highlight. The song has a catchy beat and some very thought-provoking lyrics, with a brilliant chorus which really hightens your spirits. The latter is an even better song, in which Alanis sings about the stupid cult followings that gather to connect with so-called higher spirits and other-worldy beings. \\"I've seen them coming to line up from Switzerland and America,\\" she sings in an angry vocal attack. The beat is crunky and rusty, and this gives off an old and grand rock feel. The final minute of the song consists of Alanis wailing \\"Ave Maria\\" constantly, to stunning effect. \\"Thank U,\\" the album's lead single, is one of Alanis' personal favourites. Alanis thanks things in her life that have being a constant form of intelligence and support. \\"Thank you India, thank you terror, thank you disillusionment\\" sings Alanis while a breath-taking beat swirls in the background. \\"Are You Still Mad\\" is a wonderful acoustic song in which Alanis' vocals shine brightly, as she tells an ex-lover to get over his complaining. In \\"Sympathetic Character,\\" Alanis rips her heart out and smears it all over a canvas, creating an instantly classic indie anthem. The song has some very strange twists and lyrics, coupled with excellent and unique beats.<br /><br />\\"That I Would Be Good\\" is the album's chill-out track. Alanis talks about how she would react if she lost all her fame and wealth. Her vocals are again on top form, and a wind instrument plays the song out in fine form. \\"The Couch\\" is five and a half minutes of pure brilliance. The song is performed in a stream-of-consciousness style, and this can be seen on the lyrics on the inside of the sleeve. Eight paragraphs of lyrical bliss about her father dominate the song, and the beat grows ever more dominant with each of the paragraphs. The lyrics are just perfect, and the tribal beat is truly spooky at times. Amazing - the best song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Can't Not\\" and \\"UR\\" are yet more gems. The former is a mid-tempo composition with yet more excellent lyrics and wonderful sounds - on this song, the beat sounds like two pieces of wood bashing together slowly. Strange, yes. Awful, no. In the latter Alanis chills out, letting us in on her feelings about a particular person. \\"I Was Hoping\\" is another stream-of-consciousness style song in which Alanis sings in a fast vocal tone. Her vocals are good, and she sings them fast as if she is trying to force them out. Very good and original. \\"One\\" is another fantastic song. \\"I am the biggest hypocrite, I've been undeniably jealous\\" cries Alanis in a voice filled with emotion. The beat is sad and sorrowful, and this adds further to the dark and moody feel to the album.<br /><br />\\"Would Not Come\\" is a wonderful song. Alanis' vocals seem very forced in an evil cackling tone. \\"If I make a lot of tinsel then people will want to, if I am hardened no fear of further abandonment,\\"she sings before a wonderful chorus, which is followed up by a stunningly catchy rock solo. \\"Unsent\\" is the most original and unique song on the album. Alanis sings to five ex-lovers separately (Matthew/Jonathan/Terrance/Marcus/Lou) about all the good times they shared, and some of the bad. It's done wonderfully, and you get something new out of it everytime you listen to it. \\"So Pure\\" is the shortest cut on the album, and it's an excellent psychedelic song whipped into a flurry of funky beats and unique lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Joining You\\" is, without a word of a lie, undoubtedly one of the best songs you will ever hear. Alanis sings about a close friend who committed suicide, and Alanis is saying that she would be joining them if they were both our bodies/futures/culture/leaders etc. The verses are low and depressing, but the chorus is an uplifting masterpiece. It sounds strange, but it's not. \\"Heart Of The House\\" is yet another excellent song. Alanis sings of her past with her much-loved mother in an extremely high pitched vocal tone, especially on the chorus where some words are hard to understand because of her emotions. \\"Your Congratulations\\" is the final song on the album, and what a disappointment. Seventeen songs, and sixteen are all stunning, amazing, wonderful works of art - but this last song? No!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Jagged Little Pill still remains my favourite Alanis album (and my favourite record ever), but Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie comes a very close second. When I first listened to this album, I really did hate it, but after I had listened about five times, I knew it was a brilliant album and one of my favourite albums ever. People say that if you loved 'Jagged' you'll hate 'Supposed,' but I really don't. Both albums are classics, and no one can deny that. Alanis is one of the greatest female artists ever, and she has had such an impact on my life. Just think of all these talentless Alanis-wannabes around today like Avril Lavigne and compare them to Alanis, the true queen of rock. The difference shines brighter than any other comparison in the music industry.ich is followed up by a stunningly catchy rock solo. \\"Unsent\\" is the most original and unique song on the album.

B0000640SA|5.0|This is not your typical &quot;mindless entertainment&quot; movie. If you are expecting to kick back and watch passively while the kids are playing in the room, the dog is barking, and you're preparing dinner, then look elsewhere. If you are unable to give your COMPLETE attention to this film, it may well be the worst film you'll ever see. But give it your undivided, and you'll find that it haunts you for days, perhaps weeks, after the credits roll. Little details will return, plot points will reveal themselves, incidents will fit together in a new way, and you'll be sitting at work thinking of ways to get off early so you can rush home and see it again. This is NOT a rental, this is an OWN IT disc. You'll want to revisit it time after time. <br />The acting is superb, the look is perfect, the premise is inspired, and the ending (which may take a few minutes to fully grasp) might just be the most jolting twist since the Statue of Liberty poked out of the sand in Planet of the Apes. <br />Buy this disc. Set aside some quality time and let it grab you. Then try, TRY, to get some sleep that night. Odds are that your mind will still be wrapping itself around this thriller until the wee hours...
B000005Z0E|5.0|Tupac Shakur's first album \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" (1991) marked the public debut of an artist whos name will now forever be associated with Rap. Prior to this release he was a member of a group called \\"Digital Underground\\". Back in 91 he was young man wanting to share his views, and all throughout this album he does: whether addressing police brutality, discrimination, poverty, street life and politics. Tupac always delivers alot of emotion in his music, whether it be deep anger,sadness,calmness or happiness . \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" has thirteen tracks (55 Minutes long) and is Executive Produced by Atron Gregory and came out on Interscope. Guest appearances come from Shock-G, Strech, and Raw Fusion. No tracks of blatant self promotion, lots of conscientious thought provoking music. Warning for those who know the Tupac of later albums on this one: Tupac's flow is far less developed, and the albums beats are oldschool. His lyrics and ability to convey emotion are solid though. \\"Young Black Male\\" starts the album off, a track with 2Pac flowing fast and with several other people talking in background and laughing, you can not help but find this track amateur sounding, all the same I like it. \\"Trapped\\" is about being young and black and having to face discrimination, police brutality among other matters, Pacs lyrics on this one had me listening to every word, and I liked the simple chorus of \\"Naw they cant keep the black man down\\". \\"Soulja's Story\\" is a dark track where Pac talks about you have to be hard to survive. \\"Violent\\" has Pac talking about the police and uses a brief sample from Public Enemy's Chuck D. \\"Words of Wisdom\\" is a highly political track, which has Pac talking about everything from drugs, the government, the United States and dropping lines like \\"No Malcolm X in my history text, Why is that? Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week? He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek\\" lines that you canunderstand coming from the son of black panther. On later albums you will find less and less tracks like this. \\"If My Homies Calls\\" is one of the first real upbeat songs on this album and is a track about being there for ones boys, like the background beat used on this. The track that stands out the most on this album for me is the incredibly deep \\"Brenda's Got a Baby\\" , which has Tupac telling a story about the downward spiral a twelve year girl takes after becoming pregnant. \\"Rebel of the Underground\\" has Pac talking about himself and is followed up by the albums closer \\"Part Time Mutha\\" where Pac puts himself in the place of a part time mother and a track which also features a lady telling a story of abuse, a strong closer to a powerful album. I dont recommend this album to people who are looking for hot beats or the Tupac of later albums, or to people who hold very specific politcal views. I  recommend this album to dedicated fans, and to people who are intrested in hearing a young more political Tupac. \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" introduced the world to a young emerging artist who would become one of hiphops most prolific and loved rappers, glad to have this album in my collection.
B000066AXD|5.0|Russell Crowe is incredible as the West Virginia genius, John Nash. Jennifer Connerly, does a fine job as his wife, Alicia. The big shock of the film works;we find out that whole portions of John's day to day life exist only in his head and have for years. Looking at it later, you can see the very subtle hints that people and things are just fantasies. Nash's best friend only appears when he really needs him. Ed Harris appears, in highly stressful or emotional times, like his wedding day. This is a great film and only has a few tiny flaws. For example we never really understand why a girl like Alicia would fall in love with a man so different from her and her friends. Overall, I loved this film enough to buy it.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This album left me reeling. Simply one of the most AMAZING rock albums I have ever heard. Alice In Chains in my opinion was the band to end all bands, the prodigal son of rock music. Layne's death saddened me greatly. Many people were angry his death did not recieve as much publicity as Kurts death. This mainly because Kurt's death was a conspiricy, this was an obvious O.D. (R.I.P. LAYNE) The primary reason being that the real Genious behind Alice In Chains was Jerry Cantrell who wrote 99.9% of the bands material. I was hoping that Jerry would disappear from the music scene. Jerry did not disapoint with his return. Degredation Trip is an insane trip from start to finish, with great melodies and haunting ballads such as \\"Angel Eyes\\" and murky songs more that to his AIC song writing style such as \\"Hellbound\\". I can't describe this album...just buy it...its amazing, you won't regret it....
B000092ZYX|3.0|A lot of people seem to think that Radiohead are doing something new and innovative.  This is false.  Radiohead are not doing anything that electronic artists from 15 or 20 years ago haven't already done.  This is not a new genre and no new ground has been broken with the release of this record.  Many fans may just be too young or not musically educated enough to know this.  So, for their benefit, there it is, the plain & simple fact.<BR>Anyway, after the so-so collection of songs known as Amnesiac and an abomination of a live album, I did not have high hopes for Hail To The Thief.  I'm glad I didn't because Hail To The Theif was a let down.  There's nothing great, though most of the songs are acceptable.  The problem is that the bad ones REALLY drag the whole thing down.  That said, on to my review:<BR>\\"2+2=5\\" starts out good, though after about a minute, it becomes somewhat monotonous.  The guitars kick in about halfway through, but they're not very good.  On my first listen, I noted that they sound very much like a half-effort, as if Radiohead just put them in there because that's what people are expecting to hear.  All in all, I found the first song fun to listen to, but not especially impressive.  \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" is one of the most boring songs I've ever heard.  It's also quite annoying to listen to the line \\"sit down, stand up\\" over and over again, especially beneath the lead vocals.  When the song finally picks up with about a minute left, it's just more repetition till the end.  \\"Sail To The Moon\\" is a beautiful song musically.  Thom's vocals, however, are once again terribly monotonous (I used to think he was a really good singer...but he let me down on this album).  \\"Backdrifts\\" was the first song to really grab my attention.  It's highly electronic with a good beat.  It turns out to be a would-be great song...if only it went somewhere in its nearly 5 and a half minutes!  \\"Go To Sleep\\" is one of my favorites.  Unlike most of Radiohead's recent work, itsounds like an actual band effort instead of an electronic soundscape with some vocals thrown in.  \\"Where I End And You Begin\\" has a pretty groovy bassline and turns out to be a good song.  \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" & \\"The Gloaming\\" suffer from the same boringness as \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" (in response to another review, the timing of the percussion on \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" is NOT genius...that's how music is supposed to be--Radiohead did NOT invent perfect timing).  \\"There There\\" is very good (I love the drum fills!) and obviously the most commercial-sounding.  NOTE:  If you've heard this song on the radio and are considering buying Hail To The Thief based on this song, be forewarned that the prominence of guitars on this track does not reflect upon the rest of the album!  \\"I Will\\" is another good one, but since it's only two minutes long, you barely notice it.  \\"I Will\\" fades out into \\"A Punchup At A Wedding,\\" which features some upbeat, almost happy-sounding piano at the beginning.  However, once the vocals start, it becomes the same old monotany.  \\"Myxomatosis\\" is one of the more uptempo songs with a nicely distorted rhythm guitar track.  It rocks a little, but I felt somewhat disappointed by it because I felt that they could have done a lot more with it.  \\"Scatterbrain\\" brings back the pretty rhythm guitar motif, but the somewhat over-the-top vocals have become a bit much by this point in the album.  Once again, the song doesn't go much of anywhere, though it's still a decent one that would have been better if placed more towards the beginning of the album.  \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" is the only song on the album where Thom doesn't seem to try to sing beyond his ability.  The vocals are almost spoken yet quick.  It's probably the most conventional song on Hail To The Thief, and rather enjoyable.<BR>To sum things up, Hail To The Thief is a mixed bag.  There are a couple good songs, a few decent ones, and some that are downright terrible.  I found this to be a disappointingeffort from Radiohead, but not a complete loss.  I just hope that the band aren't taking themselves as seriously as some of their fans seem to be.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I never write reviews but i am compelled to because this record is that good.It takes time to grow on you but HTTT is quickly becoming my favorite radiohead album.Really how could you pick a favorite though,it would be like choosing a favorite child.Standout tracks to me are 2+2=5,I will,Sit down Stand up,Punch up at a Wedding,Go to Sleep,Sail to the moon,and my favorite track Myxamytosis.I know i spelled that wrong.My advice is to listen to this record on a good pair of headphones and let the sound envelop you.Enjoy.
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is one of the best I've ever bought. Mostly because I like alot of the songs on it. It's not one of those CDs with 1 hit single and like 1 other good song on it...I didn't know that many of them when i bought them, but once I listened to them all, I couldnt stop. Of course some songs are better than others, but, it was well worth the money i spent on it. =)
B00008S7V7|2.0|Gabriel Allon, one of the world's top art restorers, and former Israeli Intelligence Agent, is persuaded to return to action by his old mentor, the formidable Ari Shamron, Head of Israeli Intelligence. Allon has been living in Cornwall, England, working intensely on bringing a painting by Francesco Vecellio, brother of the great Titian, back to life. He is persuaded to leave the Vecellio and return to his old day job, to kill a man - Tariq. Tariq is the infamous leader of a Palestinian terrorist organization, who was responsible for the car bombing in Vienna, years before, that killed Allon's son and maimed his wife Leah. The radical Palestinian now plots to destroy the Middle East peace negotiations, which are presently in high gear.<br />A French Jewish celebrity model, Sarah Halevy, A.K.A. Jacqueline Delacroix, is recruited to assist Allon. She had worked with him in the past, as his \\"bat leveyha,\\" female assistant agent. They became lovers, and when the assignment was over, Gabriel returned to his wife and confessed all. Sarah/Jacqueline is still in love with him. Allon blames himself for the car bombing that destroyed his family. He believes that if he had not been unfaithful, his wife and son would never have accompanied him to Vienna, etc, etc..<br />Having read other suspense thrillers by Mr. Silva, I picked-up this book, hoping to enjoy another terrific read. Wrong! The shallow narrative and dialogue, are scattered and loose. The chapters are very short and insubstantial, and the author rapidly moves the action from Cornwall to Tiberias to Greece to Tel Aviv, Zurich, London, Amsterdam, etc., but not much happens except movement in trains, planes, boats and cars. Little is accomplished except lots of page turning by the reader. There is also time travel, in the form of various flashbacks, which serve to confuse whatever plot there is. The characters are not developed enough to form any real attachment to them. They all carry enough excess baggage to fill a cargo plane. Gabriel, with his lost family and need for revenge against Tariq; Tariq, who hates Allon for murdering his terrorist brother; Jacqueline with her grandparents killed in the holocaust and her unrequited love for Gabriel; everybody with mixed feelings for Ari Shamron. Oye...they all need intensive therapy!<br />The action and plot do begin to move a bit faster on, or around, page 205. I barely hung-in that long. And even when things do pick-up, the plots and plans are not believable, nor very exciting. I would pass on this one and read another of Daniel Silva's much better novels instead.argo plane.

B000099T2L|2.0|i bought this CD thinking that it would be amazing and mind blowing and when i put in my CD player...i wanted to throw this CD away...i really like Beyonce but going solo isn't exactly her destiny...my favorite song(s) were Crazy In Love, Dangerously In Love 2, and The Way I Like It.....sorry B
B000099T2L|5.0|Released on June 24, 2003, Dangerously In Love\\" is a highly-antipated album by one of the most sexiest, hard-working, busiest entertainer in the world today, Beyoncé. Most of us know Beyoncé from one of the most best-selling girl groups, Destiny's Child, but her solo carreer is taking off like a rocket. She claims the album \\"to celebrate the evolution of a woman\\". She certainly has evolved. As July 6, 2003, the album debuted at #1 on the billboard for Top R&B/Hip hop album and Hot 100 and is classified as the \\"Greatest Gainer\\". The first single \\"Crazy In Love\\" feat. Jay-Z debuts at #1 Billboard Hot 100.<BR><br />1. Crazy In Love (feat. Jay-Z) - This is first single. Very hot and spicy. The music is like a parade band (like live horns, etc.) It basically is talking about being so in love that you are going out of your mind. 5/5<br />2. Naughty Girl - This song is on fire. It's a club song, but shows alot of her soprano ability. Contains elements from \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" by Donna Summer. 5/5<br />3. Baby Boy (feat. Sean Paul) - Second single. This song is excellent. The collaberation was great. It has a strong reggae vibe to it. It talks about seeing a guy at a party and thinking + dreaming about him all the time, even though you only seen him once. 6/5<BR>4. Hip Hop Star (feat. Big Boi and Sleepy Brown) - This song is a little bit risque. It has a Marilyn Monroe vibe mixed with Hip-Hop. 4.5/5<br />5. Be With You - This song is so beautiful. It's a risque song, but has strong background. It talks about being with someone that you rather be with than anyone else. Contains elements from \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\", a 70's song. 5.5/5<br />6. Me, Myself, and I - This song is like another \\"Independent Women\\". Celebrates independence of a woman. Has a soft, mellow beat. Basically, she's saying that she only needs herself to get by. 5/5<br />7. Yes - This songs is one of my favorites on the album. A slow jams that talks about being naive to a guy, but when she disagreeswith him, he forgets about her being naive in the past. 6/5<br />8. Signs (feat. Missy Elliott) - This is my favorite song that just talking about guys with different signs of Astrology, and judging guys by the sign. Missy Elliott did a great job featuring on producing on the songs. People are kind of curious about the line being sung repetitively \\"I was in love with a Saggitarius\\", because Jay-Z birthday is Dec. 4. This songs has an excellent beat. \\"They can come up with whatever conclusion they like\\", she says. 7/5<br />9. Speechless - Another one of my favorites. Has an Isley Brothers rock edge to it. Talking about a guy taking her breath away with his loving. 6/5<br />10. That's How You Like it (feat. Jay-Z)- Another one of my favorites. The title tells what the song is about. Hardcore Hip-Hop with Jay-Z,who is my favorite rapper. 6/5<br />11. The Closer I Get To You (Duet with Luther Vandross) - This is my second best song on the album, because it has that old-school beat to it. A remake of Robert Flack and Donnie Hathaway's song. The title tells the song. Luther Vandross has an incredicle voice. This song is also on Luther Vandross's latest album \\"Dance With My Father\\"; go support my boy. 7/5<br />12. Dangerously In Love 2 - As most of us know, this song is off the Destiny's Child 3rd album \\"Survivor\\". It's similar to the first one, except it has a piano melody to it. The title describes the song. Very beautiful and shows her vocal abilities. Pure R&B song. 5/5<br />13. Beyoncé Interlude - A very beautiful, metaphoric, and letteric poem. 5.5/5<br />14. Gift From Virgo - A '50 musical beat that's that about a loving everything about a guy. Very wonderful background vocals.<BR>4.5/5<br />*Bonus Track* Daddy - This is SUCH a sweet, emotional song dedicated to her father/manager. It's a song about reminising about the times they've had. Another one of my favorites. Has a orchestral beat to it. 6.5/5<br />If you don't have Beyoncé's album, please pick it up. It will take you in a pure R&B. Also, pick up her bandmates' album also (Kelly Rowland's \\"Simply Deep and Michelle Williams's \\"Heart To Yours\\"). Keep buying Destiny's Child albums. Don't worry, they will be back in the studio Sept. 2004 to record a new DC album. Thanks and God bless.
B00006CXXU|4.0|i'm in love with this CD....a billion times better than the first and she has an amazing talent...hell yeah....i liked all of the songs...
B00005JM09|1.0|I was worried that a Post-Matrix Terminator movie just wouldn't work...after all, T2 redefined all the rules for special effects, action scenes, and post (well, really pre) apocalyptic sci-fi movies in 1991 and The Matrix changed all the rules again in 1999.  Turns out I didn't really have to worry about the context of a Post-Matrix world ruining T3...cause it's simply a bad enough movie in its own right.<br />Where to start?  Well, first how about the fact that the whole movie up until the last ten minutes, is a complete re-tread of T2.  Evil, more advanced terminator comes back from the future to kill John Conner...Arnold, our beloved good and less advanced terminator arrives just in time to save him.  They fight a bunch and the good guys eventually decide to attempt destroying Skynet, thereby escaping fate.  Same old ground, not much new.<br />Oh, but there IS a new, more advanced evil terminator...a combination of the two previous terminators with a few added bonuses...like she can network with other machines.  She uses this ability to go online through a telephone and retrieve information and command a squad of driverless police cars to chase our fleeing heroes.  Now, I'll admit, this is an interesting idea but beyond the two instances mentioned above, it's barely utilized.  Instead they focus more on what weapons she can turn her arms into.  Also, she doesn't seem very threatening due to the fact that she's defeated WAY too easily.  In T2 it took the combined efforts of John & Sara Connor, and Arnold's terminator to triumph...here Arnold pretty much does it himself, and in much less dramatic fashion.  John Connor and his future wife Kate are pretty much useless.<br />And there's another problem...the non-terminator heroes in T2 were likable...vulnerable but tough, they at least never gave up despite seemingly impossible odds.  T3, on the other hand, is an endless stream of giving up, and here is where the series really suffers to the loss of Sara Conner as a character.  The grown up John Connor is not the boy we remember...he's become a useless whiner.  Claire Daines' Kate isn't much more likable...she's pretty much just \\"there\\" as the two machines duke it out.  Uninspired performances and a horrid script lend a hand in creating two characters I truly couldn't care less about.  FINALLY, in the last ten minutes of the film, they stand up for themselves.  I'll admit, the ending was the one good thing about the film...interesting and gusty...but without anything of merit leading up to it, it wasn't enough.<br />Among the list of other problems with T3 is the awful musical score, or lack thereof (almost non-existent...it left scenes that could have been emotional seem hollow).  There are GIANT plot holes...for example, if the evil terminator can control vehicles to chase our heroes, why can't she just stop our heroes' vehicle?  And how exactly our heroes gain access to the heart of a top secret military facility is never explained.  The action scenes which may have seemed great in 1993 were nothing new, since The Matrix and other films have constantly been upping the ante.  Like the fight that consists of Arnold and Kristanna Lokin constantly slamming each other's heads into toilet bowls...how thrilling.  All in all a horrid film, bland in so many ways, albeit with a somewhat interesting ending.  My prediction that a post-Matrix Terminator movie wouldn't work at all has come true...

0060012358|4.0|This was a fun read. It is short--under 300 pages--so it goes by quickly. The story is set in the Discworld universe, though it is not officially one of the Discworld novels.<br />The story hinges around a boy, a talking cat, a \\"clan\\" of rats who are also able to talk--the result of eating magic-contaminated trash. They run a scam, moving from town to town faking \\"rat plagues\\" and then doing the pied piper thing (the boy plays a pipe) and getting rid of the rats--for a fee.<br />Then they get to a different sort of town, and the adventure begins.<br />Good fun, cute characters, engaging plot... go read it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i got into john about 18 months ago and all i can say is what the hell is that editorial review on about. I think that john carries an inspiring message to all those out there who have questionned themselves throughout their life. \\"Your body is a wonderland\\" just sucks the aspiring female in, and makes you think that the partner you have now may be nothing compared to joins soft american voice. <BR>i think that overall with catchy bouncy tunes like \\"no such thing\\", \\"neon\\" and \\"love song for no one\\" and romantic ballads like \\"YBIAW\\" \\"3X5\\" and a favourite of mine \\"83\\" this album is ideal for any of you DMB lovers or someone whose just looking for some damn good music!!<BR>a perfect accomplyment to Johns latest live album \\"any given thursday\\"<BR>go on buy it, you'll regret it if you dont!<BR>Char.
0553579908|5.0|The continuing tales of the Starks, the Lannisters and the rest is told in the same rich style as the first book. The war has taken the land, there are ominous happenings in the North, and dragons have returned to the world.<br /><br />The knot in my stomach only got bigger by the end of the book. Whenever things looked hopeful, something went wrong. Great plans came crashing down. The heroes are not all heroic, the villains not all villainous. Once more, there isn't a clean division between the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys.\\"<br /><br />This series is written in such a way that each new chapter takes you to the story of another of the main characters, and so you follow everyone's story alongside one another. Often in this style of writing, I get frustrated when leaving one of the \\"good\\" storylines for one of the \\"so-so\\" storylines. I feel like I'm waiting it out until I get back to the interesting characters again. Not so here. By the second page of each chapter, I've forgotten about everyone but the current character.<br /><br />The story is dark and at the end there is no resolution. Not even a small one. This series was meant to be read as a series and the books don't stand on their own. This is fine with me.
0792164903|1.0|I took great exception to the fact that this movie borrowed the name and a few (FEW) plot elements from its namesake short story.  Why bother if you're simply going to make such a radical departure from the letter and the spirit of the original?<br />I generally like both Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci (not to mention Tim Burton), but even they were not enough to raise this messy adaptation from the bowels of derivative shamelessness.
B0000683WG|5.0|this is the epitomy of T REX.<BR>I am a huge fan originally hooked from the U.S. release of Electric Warrior and on.<BR>Slider outshines warrior and is the ultimate album.<BR>I recommend Slider then warrior for beginners. Then if you appreciate them, you can buy everything you can get your hands on. <br />This release of slider includes a 2nd disc of the album pre-slick production. I love them both.<BR>While the production version of the title song is great with the strings,I also like the stripped down version. I would have to say I like them equally. It depends on my mood as to which one I will listen to. It is a shame what drug addiction did to his talent and life. Then the tragic auto accident when he cleaned up and was making a go of it once more. Rock on, Rock on, yeah,yeah,yeah
B000002H33|5.0|This cd is another awsome sequel to the metallica trilogy. This was one of the last few hit metallica cd's. After this, they pretty much go downhill. Some of the good songs would be Battery, Master of Puppets, Sanitarium, and pretty much the rest of the cd. This would be an awsome cd to get but dont get St. Anger. That would not be a wise choice. If you didnt like Load, Reload, or Garage Inc., you will not like that cd. It isnt even as good as Garage Inc. which wasnt good in the first place. So get Kill em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, ...And Justice for All, and Metallica a.k.a. The Black Album as your first priorities.
0789723107|5.0|If you are fed up with reading yet another version of the same &quot;how to attract gazillion visitors to your website&quot; story, this is THE book for you. Steve Krug makes an excellent job explaining how users perceive information on the net. Even more surprising is the fact the he does not offer a universal solution to solving usability problems. He just explains how to observe visitor's behaviour and what to make of this observation. How you will solve a specific problem is left to your judgment -- your common sense.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is the saddest and the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  Bravo, Mr. Cash. Bravo.
055357342X|5.0|This book is as good as the first two. The characters continue to develop, the war continues, everyone is in peril...<br />By now I have an emotional stake in the characters and, as with the previous ones, I was turning the pages as fast as I could to learn the outcome of each new situation. The plot twists had me holding my breath, and I nearly cried in several places.<br />As with book two, the book ends in a maddeningly frustrating cliff hanger, and book four isn't due out until the fall. ARRGG!!!!<br />This series is truly epic, and it's extremely well written. I can't stand it that the next book isn't out yet.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Sorry, but I can't agree with the majority of the glaring reviews for this cd.  This cd has three good songs on it; and those are the three that played on the radio.  The rest of the cd is absolute garbage, and wouldn't have sold had it been put on the radio.  The first song sounds good, until she is stopped and asked if she's doing an X-lax commerical.  This makes sense, because we'd all  much rather hear them talk about X-lax than listen to the song!!! (sarcasm)  Songs like Dear Diary are terrible.  I've listened to this cd about three times, and then I filed it away somewhere so I wouldn't have to see it anymore.  Seriously, save your money.  If you really like \\"Just Like a Pill\\", \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Get This Party Started\\", buy them as singles, don't waste your time with the entire cd.
B00005JM09|5.0|come on you people this movie is well done i know there are some elements that felt strange like the score (no brad fiedel this time) or the excesive comic relief but this one still delivers. the trick for this one is to stop trying to compare this one with the others  for example t2 is still the best but that doesnt make the first part a piece of junk, cause every part have something different (t1 arnold is the villian) (t2 arnold is the heroe)and t3 arnold is the heroe and for an instance a villian. for me this one was very good, and guys i think with all due respect that the tx was a more very well crafted cyborg than t-1000  for example this one had an endo skelleton covered by liquid metal for me thats more relevant than a walking bloob.have you ever ask yourself were can we locate t-1000 microship, nowere maybe he was remote controlled but dont get me wrong the t-1000 was a more scary cyborg than tx but that is beacause robert patrick was perfect for this character and kristanna loken well i thought she was to pretty to play a terminator. in my opinion terminator 3 still has the power and it was better than the to long to boring matrix or that disaster they call 2 fast 2 furious
0553277472|5.0|First of all, this book is amazing.  I read it while at work (security job) in about 3 sittings of 4 hours a piece and I think that made a huge difference in the way I feel about the book.  It is slow reading and some of the topics were difficult, but I am pretty well versed in psychology and philosophy and everything was explained so well that I feel like I came away with a great deal of new knowledge in both of those areas.  If you want a summary of the books contents that has been given in the editorial review and the review just below mine.  I have chosen to write about what the book meant to me.  The thing about the book that amazed me so much is the way that it was able to take hold of my mind for hours at a time and lead me in diferent philosophical directions.  It was like having a long philosophical discussion with myself and not even realizing it and it really reminded me of some guided meditations I've been on (only with a great deal more substance).  To me, this book is required reading for anyone who considders themselves an intellectual or any lover of philosophy (especially metaphysics).  It is a beautiful journey full of ups and downs and it really is one of the most important cultural pieces of the century.  Please do yourself a favor and read this book.  It is a long, difficult task, but well worth it.
0812580346|4.0|The one thing that made this novel a somewhat mixed pleasure is the authors need to explain all. Not only the question why and how a flash forward is possible, if we live in a predetermined universe or if we can change our fate, but to top it with his vision about the fate of humanity. <br />That last piece was a) totally unnecessary for the rest of the story, but b) left a very stale taste in the mind. In other words: it diminished an excellent book to (just) very good.<br />I observed the same thing in &quot;Calculating God&quot;. If Sawyer just knew when to stop, it would IMHO make his novels so much better. A similar story is told by James Hogan in &quot;Thrice upon a Time&quot; and since it is much more focused, it is a better novel.<br />In this one the potential is there for so much more, but the author overreaches. In a way he was on flash forward too...
0385504209|2.0|Never buy a book with the word Code in the title. That is one message that can be derived from a perusal of this book. But perusal is perhaps too strong. The book does not require careful reading to reveal that it is built on rather flimsy intellectual foundations, and that the writing is very awkward. There are some interesting asides pertaining to historic survivals, and to the origin of words, but for the reader who loves the crafting of words, richness of style, this book is a vast disappointment.
0553573403|5.0|I have rarely read a series with such three-dimensional characters. Very few characters are all good or all bad. Most are sympathetic in some way.<br />They are also among the most tragic books I've read. So many main characters die, and so many things go wrong...<br />I recommend this series to anyone who is looking for something to sink their teeth into. Good characters, good plots, good writing. It's epic fantasy, but more of the \\"King Arthur\\" type than the unicorns and elves variety.
0596004966|4.0|The C++ Pocket Reference is designed for C or Java developers who occasionally program in C++ and need a syntax reminder.  Not designed as a tutorial or provide lengthy instruction on the subject, this book is great for a one paragraph explanation on a particular topic.  <br />I found this to be a very useful and easy to follow book.   It starts out with the basics of writing a C++ program (processor directives, data types) and slowly moves into more complicated aspects of this language (like templates and memory management).<br />I would highly recommend this as a reference book if you find yourself occasionally doing some programming in C++.
B000089RVX|4.0|Let me be straight, I don't really like &quot;nu metal&quot;. When the Deftones first came out I thought that maybe they were the start of something cool....that didn't happen in my opinion, but what do I know? But I do have a bizzare music taste ranging from The Beatles to Nirvana, Devo to GN'R and Prince. So, once in awhile something new gets my attention. This CD is by far a standout amungst it's peers. If you're going to do something....do something different from the rest of the new school. Enter: Amy Lee, the lead vocalist of Evenescence. Hard rock/metal music with an amazing soaring female vocalist. There's a lot of room to screw something like that up....but they pull it off amazingly well. I was introduced to this band by the Daredevil movie and I thought that &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; summed up Matt Murdock and Elektra beutifully. The next week in every comic shop I frequent...this CD was playing to rave reviews, from a variety of music fans. My favorite thing about this CD is that unlike all the other &quot;nu metal&quot; out there they don't resort to screaming their heads off, they actually sing amazing melodies to this pounding heavy music. The downside of this CD (if you care) is that it sounds like all of the music is in the same key. They actually have to look to Amy Lee to change up the sound. Which she does, but most guitar players could tell you they need to explore other keys. That's the only reason I couldn't give it &quot;5 stars&quot;
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie definitely lives up to the Harry Potter book. The movie stays true to the books and helps you visually to. The actors fit the descriptions of the book very well.
0451528018|1.0|&quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it.  Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it.  It was full of babble and slow adventures.  Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book.  I do not recommend.
B00008AY3L|3.0|I listened to some of the music samples of Ben Harper's music from \\"Diamonds On The Inside,\\" and thought to myself: Ben's like listening to a mellower Lenny Kravitz. I saw an awesome performance of Ben teaming-up with his good-friend Jack Johnson on [NBC's] \\"Last Call\\" w/Carson Daly. They played some original pieces together, while also playing a cover of some Bob Marley  tunes. When you combine the two, they deliver an unmistakable performance - bringing people together - who listen to their music as a \\"unified-whole.\\" This duo of \\"highly-talented\\" guitarists, \\"kicks butt.\\" There's not a whole lot I can say about this particular album other than to say, there's not very many good songs on it. Ben's enigmatic-style voice goes from being soulful - to sounding nasally and high-pitched (which really gets to be annoying somtimes), and a little breathy. Ben's good at guitar - don't get me wrong - but with his voice and some of the inconsitancy (the title of the CD \\"Diamonds On The Inside,\\" explains it all) of some of the songs is the reason why I give this album ***3-stars***.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Disappointed with \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\"?  Felt let down? ACHIEVE \\"Equlibrium\\" by watching this GREAT movie.<BR>     WOW!!!...Taking a breather after finishing this incredible film had to sit down and throw in my two cents.<BR>     First of all, this is another much needed and sorely missed breath of fresh air that we've seen so rarely come down the pike from the cookie-cutter that is Hollywood.  This movie made me feel the same way after viewing such films as \\"Dark City\\", \\"The Matrix\\", \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", \\"Memento\\",  \\"Donnie Darko\\", \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\", as well as The films of Wes and Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze, Guy Ritchie, and Doug Liman--which is completly surprised, and pleased with the blend of intelligence with action and an ever increasing difficulty level of taking elements of genres and giving them a unique new twist (true originality is all but dead).<BR>     Granted this movie uses elements of stories we've seen before whether it be the oppressive dystopias of movies like 1984, Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, THX 1138, Metropolis, Brazil, Gattaca, Logan's Run, Rollerball (the original), or \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\".  <BR>     It's interesting to note that Libria's citizens are encouraged to \\"rat\\" each other out. It brings to mind Mao or McCarthy although not to such hysterical fever pitches...that would be a \\"sense offense\\". Instead of books, or political idealogies, emotions themselves are outlawed. Instead of \\"A Brave New World's\\" ~soma~ the good citizen's of Libria have the opiate for the masses \\"Prozium\\".  This is Libria's cure to end war (unlike Rollerball's \\"game\\").  <br />    Not that ALL emotions are eradicated , as director Kurt Wimmer shares, rather prozium eliminates mankind's tempestous highs and lows.  And those emotions, ambition, jealousy, that might further Libria's cause of promoting \\"Non-feeling\\" are allowed such as Taye Diggs character's motivation to bring John Preston (Christian Bale) down.  It's also interesting tonote that the director meant this as a parable, a cautionary tale of socio-politcal ideology gone wrong, rather than a literal story.<BR>     The Grammaton Clerics similarity to the sandmen in \\"Logan's Run\\" (\\"Minority Report\\" has similarities to \\"LR\\" as well) was interesting--two partner cops hunting down \\"offenders\\" whether they be \\"runners\\", \\"Pre-criminals\\", or in this case \\"sense offenders\\".  One has to pursue and kill a partner then have his conscience / soul pricked to have an epiphany and find they are questioned or pursued themselves.<BR>     I can't say enough about the performances other than agreeing with the director he batted a thousand with his casting.  Everybody was superb, Christian Bale is a delight to watch grow with each new performance (Damn why can't Hollywood wise up to this proven action star with acting chops to boot-- like the late Brandon Lee, Christian Bale packs a deadly combo of ripped physicallity with a deep emotional wellspring to draw on).  Sean Bean continues to blow me away with performances of his \\"flawed= REAL\\" characters, whether in \\"Goldeneye\\", \\"Patriot Games\\", \\"Ronin\\", or \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" Bean wrenches a very soulful, human performance out of what little screen time he's given.<BR>     The action of this movie is a much needed shot in the arm for HARD CORE ACTION JUNKIES.  The impressive \\"Gun Kata\\" invented by the director is a fresh, inventive next-step in the evolution of the cinematic gun battle. Hong Kong innovators such as John Woo / Chow Yun Fat ushered in the Balletic \\"Gun Fu\\" (as coined by writer Ric Meyers).  This film unlike \\"The Matrix\\" and it's sequels does not rely on \\"wire-fu\\" stunts-- (the flip by Cleric Preston was accomplished by a diving champion stunt double) --refreshing after being bombarded by the likes of the 2 \\"Charlie's Angels\\" entries, augmentation of recent Jackie Chan (The Tuxedo), Jet Li (Pick one), and Chow Yun Fat (Bullet-proof Monk) movies.  Don't get me wrongwire work is a great tool in use of projects involving super-human ability (such as Jet Li's multiverse titan in \\"The One\\") any number of recent Superhero movies (Blade 2, Daredevil, Spiderman, X-men), or the Swordplay classic \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\".<BR>     The action sequences resonate with the speed and beauty of the best of Jet Li's Hong Kong work, married with the swordplay scenes with Preston's use of the \\"Zatoichi\\" underhand swordhold style.  The opening introduction to the prowess of the Grammaton Cleric's \\"Gun-Kata\\", the numerous confrontations between Preston and the many \\"sweepers\\", the Kendo bokken match between Preston and Brandt, and the climactic Hallway \\"weeble wobble-clip\\" gun battle, Preston and Brandt's \\"Face-off\\", and the final confrontation between Dupont (Angus MacFadyen / Braveheart) which innovatively uses the hand locking styles reminiscent of Wing Chun's 'chi sau'/'lok sau', or Tai Chi Chuan's 'toi sau' only with guns!<BR>     In the Director's commentary Kurt Wimmer hints at a fighting technique not used in this movie that he's saving for a future project...I can't wait!<BR>     I find as with the umpteen reviewers before me the \\"Matrix\\" comparison on the box a bit of a misnomer and rather tedious.  As for the swipes at Preston's clothes copying Neo, other than they are sleek tight fitting and black I don't see the comparison (I mean Neo was wearing a trenchcoat!) I also remind all that \\"Equilibrium\\" predates \\"Matrix re-loaded\\" in which the tables are turned Neo's \\"uber-mensch/superman\\" persona has on the \\"GOD Smock\\".  I find that I, as a political cartoonist in a daily competition with other artists to put a humorous spin on current events notice on occasion that 2 or more creative people will come up with the same idea independently from one another.  So I agree with director Kurt Wimmer that the bros. Wachowski were giving Neo religious garb to outwardly represent his 'deity' which coincidently took on the 19th century deaconsmock motif.<BR>     In the interest of observation, viewers may find Jim Jarmusch's \\"Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai\\" (2000) interesting in that the Hit-man character played by Forest Whitacker adheres to Modern Bushido as he swings his pistols around like swords...something to check out-you just might LIKE it!
B00000K2SC|5.0|The year is 1999........ no wait, the year is 2199..... we think. Unfortunately, machines have ruled the Earth for too long and we don't know everything that has happened. All we know is that most of humanity is in a computer program called the Matrix. Oh yeah........ the machines are using us like batteries.<br />One of the most special effects laden movies of all time, &quot;Matrix&quot; still holds it ground as one of the best many years later. Add to that a solid story line and terrific casting, and you have the makings of a very good movie.<br />Keanu Reeves is Neo, a computer hacker who knows that there is something more to the world than he can see but can't quite figure it out. Morphius believes that Neo is the one that can save humanity from the Matrix and, ultimately, from the machines. The Agents, machines in the Matrix, are also looking for Neo. But they do not realize just who this man really is.<br />Part-one of a three-part trilogy, &quot;Matrix&quot; is a fast-paced action movie that will keep you riveted to your seat from start to finish. This VHS version also comes with 4 behind-the-scenes features at the end of the movie that shows you how parts of the movie were made, including the awesome &quot;bullet&quot; scene on top of the building.<br />Eventually, all three parts of this trilogy will be offered together in some compilation DVD set, with a lot of cool extras. While you wait for that to come out, go ahead and pick up the original and enjoy it now.
B000065U1N|5.0|From the early 19th century until the 1960s or so, the \\"enlightened\\" nations of Europe carved up Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent willy-nilly, hungry to exploit their material and manpower resources and totally oblivious to the natural and tribal boundaries of those lands. As usual, the job of sorting out these messes has fallen to the United States and the brave men depicted in films such as this. Italy carved up the Horn of Africa in the late 19th and early 20th century; but where were the Italians when Somalia was tearing itself apart in the 1990s, after the fall of the Communist dictator Barre? <br />The whole 1992-3 incursion into Somalia may have ill-conceived, but there is no doubt that it was Europe who created this godawful mess and then retreated, leaving the various warlords of that nation to brutalize and strarve its people. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is the story of how the US tried to bring some order and stability to this poor nation. <br />We still have this problem 10 years later. Where were the French and Belgians during the Rwanda genocide, barely a year after the events depicted in \\"Black Hawk Down\\"? No doubt they were sitting in Paris cafes sipping lattes and blaming the US for not doing something about the situation. <br />BHD is the most brutal and realistic war movie of the last few years. The movie wisely does not attempt to politicize the situation or blame anyone for it; it simply shows what happened as well as the stupendous courage of the Rangers and Delta Forces who were caught up in a nasty firefight. <br />Some have called this film racist, since almost all of the US soldiers in the conflict where white whereas the enemy combatants were Africans. But I fail to see how this is racist - it's simply the way it was. Before viewing this film (or after) I recommend reading a history of European colonialism in the Horn of Africa or Central Africa, such as \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\".
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix was the most popular R-rated film when it came out in the theaters, and it has reason to be so. Obviously the most stand-out feature of this film is the special effects, which are flaunted from stem to stern. Awesome jumps over highways, lengthy shoot-outs in pillared rooms, and martial arts combat with a sentient program, this film has it all.<br />Keanu Reeves as Thomas A. Anderson AKA Neo is in his element in this film, and he comes off very well with his sunglasses and ankle-length leather jacket concealing a veritable arsenal of rapid-fire weaponry. Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity gives a good screen presence, and pulls off a tough-tender mix in her character--there is a vast difference between her ferocious karate chops at the beginning of the film and her loving words to Neo close to the end. Laurence Fishburne is very good as Morpheus, even though he is in manacles for a good part of the film.<br />  Then there is Hugo Weaving. This masterful actor can convulse the audience with his drawn-out speech and delliberate movements, or he can have them pitying and encouraging Neo as he hurls the good guy into walls and pummels him with super fast fists.<br />  The Wachowski brothers, the directors and writers of the film, handle it well with good camera angles and a fine screenplay.<br />  For those searching for thrills and a heavy slant toward visual effects, this is a good movie to look into.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The lyrics of their songs are so meaningful and profound. It shows that they enjoy what they are doing and that they want to make an impact on people. I loved them after hearing just one song, then i sampled more and loved them and now i own the CD. They are, to me, the best band, great lyrics, awesome vocals, and realy good guitar playing, if you like rock music, or lyrics that actually make you think, and mean something (not like most teenie boper bands like that Britney &quot;oops i did it again&quot;) then they are the band for you! I hope they will come out with another CD soon! I hope people like this CD as much as i do!!
B00005JKHN|5.0|Disney took a while, but they have finally embraced the DVD format.  As with everything else, when they do it, they do it right and big!  <br />When Disney first stuck their foot in the DVD waters they did it slowly, offering movies without major extras and at a price well above their competition.  With a stable of classics in their coffers I wrote some scathing reviews and comments on various web sites.  Disney finally got it through their heads that DVD has broken through to become the standard format for the new millenium.<br />Several other Disney Disks have gotten this deluxe treatment.  Their collaborations with Pixar; Toy Story One and Two, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc were among the first. Tarzan, Atlantis, Beauty and the Beast as well as Dumbo and a variety of lesser films have editions chock full of extras as well.  It was fitting that Snow White was released as a Double Disk set last year and they have followed that up with one of my faves, Sleeping Beauty.<br />The film has been remastered all around.  Crisp new sound and picture wrapped up with a bevy of extras that will make any cinemafile drool.  Along with the standard documentaries and commentaries this edition has something I wish had been packaged with every disk released to date; A widescreen to pan and scan comparison.  Finally I can show my friends and family why widescreen is preferable to 'full screen'.  (You reading this Blockbuster video??)<br />Getting off the soapbox now...<br />I pre-ordered mine.  Make sure you don't let this one slip away for another generation.
0790731452|5.0|Hollywood has made movies from books, TV shows, even other movies. However, \\"Mars Attacks\\" may be the first time a movie was made from a trading card.<br />Back in the late 1960s, Topps Cards created a line of Mars Attacks trading cards. However, these cards were pulled off the shelves after only a few months because the aliens depicted on them were considered to be too gruesome. My, how times have changed.<br />Director Tim Burton has taken those old trading cards and recreated them into this Sci-Fi B-movie throwback. In the process, he has created a movie that is pure, guiltless fun.<br />\\"Mars Attacks\\" also benefits from an all-star cast, including Jack Nicholson (in a dual-role), Michael J. Fox, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Short, Danny Devito, Glenn Close, Natalie Portman, Tom Jones, Annette Bening, Lukas Haas, Jim Brown, and many others. The fact that you get to watch the aliens disentegrate (and otherwise kill) many of these stars only adds to the fun. Unfortunately, Tom Jones wasn't one of those unlucky stars. Maybe someday a sequel will be made that will rectify that. :)<br />Oh yeah........ did I happen to mention that Congress gets vaporized? This proves that the Martians aren't all bad!<br />The DVD comes with many extras, including quite a few production notes that helps you to understand how the movie came to be. This is one movie that you will want to see over and over again (especially anytime that Congress is getting on your nerves).
B00009MGR6|5.0|I can't get enough of this album! This has to be some of their best work (even if some people don't think so...). This has all new material, with fast-driving beats and rock anthems. \\"Heatseeker\\" is definitely the hit single off of this album and probably my 2nd favorite AC/DC song. \\"That's The Way I Wanna Rock And Roll\\" is an instant rock anthem, and a kick-... live performance. \\"Meanstreak\\" is one of my favorites, with a smashing beat to it. Other songs such as Nick Of Time and Ruff Stuff are good numbers too. I would purchase this album even if you have the original copy.....This album is a tad better than Fly On The Wall and Flick Of The Switch (Due to \\"Heatseeker\\")
B00005JKCH|3.0|For the most part, there is nothing terrible to pick on in Spider Man. However, this film fails to hold high interest all throughout. Most likely this is because the movie is trying to make a top-notch film from a children's comic book, which is not necessarily easy to do.<br />Most of the acting is good. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker-Spider Man is not bad. He does well at portraying Peter's shy, picked on life at school, and then his transformation to a more confidant superhero.<br />Kirsten Dunst is alright as M.J., but her acting does not stand out as amazing--there is nothing to complain about, however.<br />Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/the somewhat overdone villain the Green Goblin, deffinitely stands out. He plays Norman well as he deteriorates from a nice businessman to a trapped man enslaved to the Goblin's intimidating mask.<br />So far, so good. This film, coming as it did after a history of many films crammed with convincing special effects, it would be expected that Spider Man would be the same. Unfortunately, the effects here are somewhat disappointing. Especially in one scene where Peter Parker is jumping up the wall of a building, it looks like he is in a computer game--a well done, convincing computer game, but still a computer game.<br />The character of the Green Goblin is something I have somewhat of a beef with. I would have no problem if Sam Raimi, the director of the film, had kept his mean tempermant at the same level, but his own admittance of his standing as an anti-hero and a lunatic seems to go a little over the top.<br />With some decent action scenes and good acting, this movie is fairly good, but not the dream film.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I had seen this movie in the theaters and the songs just had me captivated.  As soon as I'd seen the movie, I knew I wanted the soundtrack.  This CD plays constantly in my car and on my computer.  From the song on having no class to the husband featuring in some songs (&quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;,&quot;Funny Honey&quot;)... where the actors and actresses performed on their own - quite an impressive CD!  Catchy tunes and strong stories give these songs enough life to make me want to jump up and sing along.
B00005JKN9|5.0|The 1800s - when New York was really wicked. I read this book in 1997 and thought \\"this would make a great movie.\\" As a native New Yorker, I've read many books on the history of NYC. I also took a senior level course on the History of NYC in college taught by Thomas Kessner (who just released an excellent book called Capital City), so I would consider myself qualified to comment on this movie. The movie packs about 30 years of history into 2 hours (or into the 16 year span of Amsterdam's life featured in the film). In terms of historical accuracy, the movie is off on many aspects; however, I think it does an excellent job of capturing the essence of what life in the infamous Five Points was like during this period in American history. Definitely a movie worth having in your collection!
B00005JLK1|5.0|1st of all for all those pple who thought it was a terrible movie they hav no sense of a interesting movie....the characters were well develpoved enough any more details and we would be bored. I loved how everything was so peaceful and went into death and horror and left us in suspence and by the end it would reveal the secrets about the ghost ship. And there even was a moral how greed blinds you. If you dont like all tha gore thats ur opinion ,you dont have to go sayin its terrible because off all the gore, all movies have gore and if you dont like it THEN DONT WATCH SCARY MOVIES DUHHHH!
B00003CXAT|4.0|Jurassic Park is a landmark film, in that nobody had ever seen special effects like the seemingly living, breathing dinosaurs it assaulted the world with. Steven Spielberg does well on this film, with several classic scenes of killer dinosaurs dismantling vehicles and slowly pacing kitchens.<br />To leave the best for last, I will discuss what I dislike with this film first.<br />Jurassic Park's story line is not very believable--mosquitos that had fed on the blood of dinosaurs being found embedded in tree sap later, and the DNA in the blood being used to create infant dinosaurs.<br />I strongly dislike and disagree with the evolutionary views in this movie. The old term '65 million years' is bandied about quite a lot, when in fact the world has been around for perhaps ten thousand years, and dinosaurs and people had lived together for a time after creation.<br />There is too much swearing in this film--so what if a woman would belt out four swear words in a row when chased by a T. Rex? We don't need to hear it on screen. Spielberg should have removed all objectionable words from this movie.<br />Another thing would be the musical score. It seems as though John Williams recycles his old scores in each and every film, and he does not improve much on his former work in Jurassic Park.<br />There are, however, many fine points to this film. Spielberg's directing is good, with foreshadowing of Velociraptor attacks and great action scenes.<br />The acting is fair, and none of the actors or actresses stand out as bad. Jeff Goldblum especially does a good characterization as the chaotician Ian Malcom.<br />The special effects are super, especially when the time at which Jurassic Park was made comes into consideration. The dinosaurs are very believable and alive seeming.<br />This brings us to the dinosaurs themselves.<br />The gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex ensures that all eyes are riveted on her, with eerie roars and ground-shaking footsteps. The SUV attack in front of the T. Rex paddock is very well done (and fortunately sans any accompanying music from John Williams.)<br />The Velociraptors are more low-profile killers, but their capacity for striking fear is probably more than that of the Rex--their intelligence is a step away from human rationality. They open doors, invade kitchens, jump on countertops, stage clever ambushes, and run at \\"Cheetah speed, sixty or seventy miles per hour,\\" as one of the movie characters puts it.<br />This film is definitely good for what is usually a cheezy genre, and makes for a good screen spectacle.is very well done (and fortunately sans any accompanying music from John Williams.) <BR>The Velociraptors are more low-profile killers, but their capacity for striking fear is probably more than that of the Rex--their intelligence is a step away from human rationality.

B00006LLNU|4.0|I write this review in honor of my recently deceased brother.  This was his favorite album and it wasn't rare for him to listen to this in his car and with teary eyes say &quot;It's just so beautiful...&quot; and it is.  I thank Sigur Ros for this album because the emotion that they captured is phenomenal.  I shared some of the closest times with my brother while listening to this album and it's simply great.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This movie has got to be one of the best Disney Classics! Aside from Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney movie I have ever seen! It's a great movie for children to watch, and an even better one for the adults who remember when it came out in theatres!
0441172717|5.0|Once you get into this book (and I know it's hard), you will be rewarded.  The first 20 pages have a lot of made up words which makes the reading very thick until you get a basic understanding of the meaning of these words (Bene Gesserit, Kwisatz Haderach, gom jabbar, Landsraad, CHOAM... the list goes on...).   But once you get a basic understanding of these words, you realize how fascinating and intricate Herbert's world is.  Truly a masterpiece.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is by far the best rock cd of all time. I love all the songs on this cd, and it has two of my favorite songs of all time, Rocket Queen and Sweet Child o' mine. If you like Paradise City than you'll love all the songs on here because Paradise is like one of the worst songs on here.<br />Welcome to the Jungle- Everyone's heard this one, its incredible. 10<BR>Its so Easy- The contrast on Axl's voice from Welcome to the Jungle and this song is amazing, it gets really deep, this is also an awesome song. 10<BR>Night Train- Straight Hard Rock, very good. 10<BR>Out ta Get Me- Not as good as the others on this cd but still great. 9<BR>Mr. Brownstone- very very cool song, its got an awesome opening and chorus. 10<BR>Paradise City- Awesome Guns N' Roses Anthem Again everyones heard it. 9<BR>My Michelle- very cool begginning, nice lyrics and guitar. 10<BR>Sweet Child o' Mine- incredible song, one of my favorites of all time. 10<BR>I Think About You- this ones a little too light for me but still a good song. 7<BR>You're Crazy- Very cool song, though it has a little too much cussing for me. 8<BR>Anything Goes- The only song I don't like on here. 5<BR>Rocket Queen- Best song on the cd. 10
B00007G207|3.0|If you are a fan of the original theatrical cut of Cinema Paradiso, allow yourself to watch this radical revision out of curiosity. If you have never seen Cinema Paradiso, your experience of the film will be RUINED if you let yourself watch the recent version first. I suggest you get acquainted with the far superior earlier cut, and later try the new version.<br />The new version is a totally different film. The focus is shifted from the central character's relationship with Alfredo, a cinema projectionist, to his lifelong obsession with a lover from his adolescence. The latter lacks believability, and radically alters the mood of the film. Aside from this insertion of a mammoth chunk of storyline that was absent from the first film, there are a few edits and extra scenes dotted here and there throughout the film that utterly ruin some of the most memorable and effective moments from the original.<br />Perhaps I am just too in love with the original (the irony here, in view of the film's major themes, is stark) to be able to accept this new version. Admittedly, the extra storyline fills in some glaring holes in the original, though not without creating a few new loose ends. If you are a fan, watch this just to satiate your curiosity, but bear in mind that you are watching a very different--and far inferior--film.
B00005JLET|5.0|Spirited away is one of the best Anime movies I have seen! It is a well thought through movies with wonderful characters and a great plot. And I'm and eleven year old who's not easy to please. I cried for half of the movie, I don't know why. I loved like no other movie I have ever seen in my life! Through the whole story, there are problems the keep piling up on th e character. Like getting her parents back or remembering her own name! I love it and I think it is a movie that everyone -everyone of all ages- should see and enjoy this spectacular anime film!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Despite some horrible reviews, this is clearly a great film that anyone would do well to have in their collection. Without doubt, Daniel Day Lewis steals the show as the almost insanely evil Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting, but DiCaprio plays well in a role that shows the true meaning of requiring patience to exact revenge. The one negative would be the role that Cameron Diaz plays in the film because it really is a non-descript part. However, it does not detract from the overall greatness of the film which clearly did not receive the credit it deserved. Great dialogue, great sets and certainly worth the wait. An excellent 2 disc set that has some fantastic extras and will certainly not disappoint.
B000002LRX|5.0|This record is arguably FNM's best. The Real Thing is definately the most catchy and fun, but Angel Dust takes the band into territory most rock music won't explore. <BR>There isn't a whole lot to say about the sound of the record that hasn't been said. Puffy's drumming has never been better, Roddy's keyboards play a much more interesting and crucial role then they did on the Real Thing, Bill's bass playing is funky, heavy and groovy, Jim can really shred when he feels like it and when he doesn't, he's still awesome. Mike's voice is absolutely INCREDIBLE on this record. He can howl, croon...into the microphone like no one I've ever heard.<BR>One thing that FNM never gets enough credit for is the lyrics. Mike is an awesome lyricist because he is original. In rock n' roll you hear a lot of anger, sex and decadence but you never get to hear what happens when the lights burn out and no ones a rock star anymore. Mike gives a voice to emotions and ideas that are rarely touched on like melancholy, guilt, resentment. His words are evocative and they give you a weird sense of deja vu. The best example of excellent lyricism on the record is RV. Rv is a monologue from a resentful old guy living in a trailer park. Its amazing that a young good looking rock star like Mike would be able to get inside the minds of strange, totally unglamorous characters and really make them breathe.

B000099T2L|5.0|I admit, i am a fan of DC and when i heard that the girls were going solo, i was quite exstatic. First came Michelle's CD which was gospel,i'm not a big fan of gospel but I copped one up anyway, not bad for gospel. Then came Kelly's CD, not bad half the songs were good, the rest just sounded like fillers. Now the lead of the band, Beyonce Knowles is coming out with her debut album Dangerously In Love. I can honestly say that each and every song on the CD is wonderfull, from beginning to end i can honestly say i don't skip a single song, each and every one of the songs on teh CD are fantastic. The collaborations on the CD are great as well, from Jay-Z to Luther Vandross, Beyonce teams up with some great performers. Honestly, anyone can enjoy the album, it has hip-hop, rap, reggae, pop, and just about any other music style you can name .I highly recomend this perfect quality produced album.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), the greatest male model in the world, teams up with his archrival Hansel (Owen Wilson) to foil an assassination plot against the Malaysian foreign minister for planning to abolish child labor.  This film takes some effective digs at the fatuity and insipidness of the fashion industry and its dependance on underpaid labor, and Stiller and Wilson are terrific, but this is essentially a one-joke film and the joke wears thin pretty quick.  Wil Ferrell does a great job as the evil fashion magnate Mugatu.  I'm waiting for the breakout role that will make him a star.
B00000099Y|1.0|Why do soo many people like this album? Okay, its better than Eminem (thats not saying much at all) but its just not that great. I've tried and I've tried to like it, but I just can't. I geuss the best thing to do is to listen to REAL metal instead (indeed this is NOT real metal).
B000002C25|5.0|I really don't understand all of the negative comments about Be Here Now (especially on the reviews of other Oasis albums).  This is a fantastic work.  I've had it for about six months and I still listen to it almost every day.  Every song is awesome.  I never even think about skipping a song on this album.  I know that many Americans have a bad opinion of Oasis, based purely on the stories they hear about certain band members.  My advise is to simply listen to the music.  This is the best band in the world today.  This album is every bit as good as What's the Story Morning Glory, The Masterplan, and Definitely Maybe.  And truth be told, I think that Standing on the Shoulder of Giants is right there also. This band is so good ....every album is outstanding.  BUY THIS ALBUM AND EVERY OTHER OASIS ALBUM.  THEY ARE GREAT!
B00005R87Q|4.0|Ok, when this movie came out it was pretty much a teenage staple. The guys liked the cars (although my gearhead friends and I would've preferred more American muscle) the girls (excuse the stereotype please) liked Vin Diesel. I remember the first time I saw the movie I didn't really understand what was going on, and the second time I realized why, this movie is missing a concrete plot, which didn't stop them from making a ton of money, and a sequel.
B00005JM09|5.0|I went to see Terminator 3 last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the special effects were better in T-2. This movie is non stop action--almost like a Indiana Jones movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The fight scenes are incredible. Plot twists. And the ending is an obvious setup to T-4 which can't come soon enough to satisfy me.To the negative reviewers---this is scifi and is intended to test your imagination. Good movie. Only wish I could give it 10 stars.
0156027321|5.0|I'm coming to the realization that there are good stories and good books.  Sometimes you get both within one publication. LIFE OF PI is a perfect example. I'll admit I was aware of this book for some time and kept passing on it.  Then, for some reason last week, I had the impulse to buy it.  I could not put it down.  It is so much more than it appears.  The descriptions of his ordeal at sea and growing companionship with the tiger are mesmerizing.  The humor breaks the tension. (Who can't relate to a young boy nicknamed &quot;Pissing&quot; by his school chums?)  It left me wondering just what it was I had read.   Read it and see what you think!
6304806442|4.0|In 1996, \\"Trainspotting\\" took the world by surprise; it was a film that was compared to the classic Stanley Kubrick's film \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", due to it's kinetic energy, and fatalistic insight. This film is not a popcorn movie; it's a movie that requires patience and whether you like it or not, it will provoke you different emotions and thoughts. <br />\\"Trainspotting\\" tells the story of Renton and his buddies Spud, Sick Boy and Tommy; all these guys are junkies and they are stuck in a constant debate between choose a \\"normal life\\" (what is normal, anyway?) and the life style of a drug addict. So as the story unfolds, we see how they promise to quit drugs and almost immediately fall again in the addiction. Also, they hang around with the local psychotic drunk Begbie; he is not a junkie, but he loves to drink and to provoke fights with the slightest opportunity.<br />The movie shows some of the main consequences that the drug abuse brings: how you lose the perspective of the things that happen around you, how you affect your family and your closest friends, how you become a drug slave, how your body deteriorates, how you can become a threat to all the people, and how pathetic you can be once you become a junkie.<br />And yet, in \\"Trainspotting\\" we see that everybody has always choices: \\"Choose life or choose not to choose life\\". However this movie is not a preach...the only purpose of \\"Trainspotting\\" is to show you what can happen to you...after all, the choice is yours.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first song I heard was Bring Me to Live. I saw the video first, and after I downloaded it and listened to the lyrics a little bit more I went out and bought the album without wanting to listen to any of the other songs first. I was SO happy the rest of the album was what I expected it to be. Sometimes when you listen to one song of a group the rest aren't as good, but this one ROCKED!<br />I think everyone should get it. It's GOOD!
B000099T2L|5.0|I have to say that, honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this album.  I have always been a huge Destiny's Child fan, then all of their drama started, and I fell into the Beyonce haters crowd.  Then, \\"Crazy In Love\\" came out and I admitted to myself that I liked it; it's catchy.  Then I went to the store to get Monica's new album, and the cashier made a face and told me, \\"You should get Beyonce instead.  Hers is much better.\\"  I didn't believe him, but after much debating, I bought it a few days later...and I loved it.  I can listen to the whole CD without skipping through any of the songs.  Overall, it's a good listen and I was wrong to have assumed that it would be disastrous because I was a \\"hater\\".<BR>\\"Speechless\\" is by far my favorite song on the album.  I also love \\"Be With You\\", \\"Yes\\", and \\"Baby Boy\\".  This is a definite must-have CD.
0780020685|5.0|A film like Seven Samurai is what makes you buy a dvd player, or begin to appreciate foreign film.  Kurosawa is an auteur, a director whose vision so saturates the film that it becomes indistinguishable from that vision; no one else could have made the film.<br /><br />But if you imagine a Kurosawa film made by Hitchcock or Bergman, it will also enable you to see what makes Kurosawa so special. In this timeless tale of struggles between the weak and the powerful, Kurosawa gives us a situation utterly dynamic. Everything is in motion. The wind is blowing. The rain is not just falling but drenching everything. And Toshiro Mifune is hypermanic.<br /><br />Intense realism in a true jidai-geki, or historical film, was the goal of Kurosawa when he set out to make Seven Samurai, a film in which desperate villagers enlist the services of ronin, or masterless samurai, to protect them from a group of returning bandits. Throughout the film, from beginning to end, you feel this story could really have happened, and yet at the remove of history, you can see that these people and these struggles are similar to our own.<br /><br />Kurosawa is a consummate artist -- his eye for beautifully framed and dynamic shots is breathtaking, and it's awesome to be able to rewatch scenes using a dvd player, or easily skip ahead to a particular scene, or view the spectacular action sequences in slow motion or at a drop-gorgeous standstill. Kurosawa seems to effortlessly incorporate compelling narrative with universal themes -- while making a stunning visual masterpiece. And there is humor too. Kurosawa also wanted to make entertaining films, and he succeeded.<br /><br />Hitchcock said that fiilming in black-and-white had achieved such a level of artistry that it was a shame color became a possibility (and indeed he chose to film Psycho in b&w even though color had become commonplace at the time); you won't find a better composed or lit black-and-white film than Seven Samurai.<br /><br />All of the actors are terrific, but Toshiro Mifune is transcendant as the buffoon with a story that is revealed layer by layer throughout the film. He is the embodiment of comedy and tragedy, and Mifune's talents are on display and such a joy to watch.<br /><br />The film is nearly three-and-a-half hours long, but at the end of it you will be sorry it's over. Watch it again while listening to the excellent 1988 commentary track by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck, who does a masterful voiceover, discussing the film's production, Kurosawa's technique and biography, film history and theory, Mifune's style, actors careers and lives, musical themes, and a host of other interesting details. You'll learn that Kambei, the inspirational samurai leader, is played by Takashi Shimura, who also played the head scientist in Godzilla; that when the studio shut down production -- twice -- because it was running over budget, Kurosawa went fishing, confident that the studio was in too deep to cancel the project; that Kurosawa was the first director to show a film in which a team is assembled for a mission, or that shows an attacking horde as it rises on the horizon. It will make you want to watch the film a third time. But what a tragedy not to have a director's commentary track!<br /><br />Seven Samurai will change the way you think about film, and this Criterion Collection print is crisp and clean and sounds beautiful. There is also a trailer and a handy index to the commentary. The enclosed pamphlet includes a short but interesting undated essay by film critic Davd Ehrenstein. If you are at all interested in expanding your appreciation of film, you must see this brilliant tale of life and virtue as told by a genius at visual storytelling.  If you want to  learn more about non-Western film, this should be one of the first seven that you see. And if you already have seen the film but love it dearly, you should get this print; it's very clean and the commentary track will add to your enjoyment.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is oneof the few gems of this summer.  This is one of those rare ablums nowadays that you can listen to from beginning to end and not skip a song!!!  Beyonce' obviously saved her good writing for her own album.  The best songs on the album are Crazy in Love, Me. Myself and I, That's how you like it, and Gift from Virgoo, with Gift from Virgo being my favorite!!!!  The worst song is Hip Hop Star, it just doesnt feel right.
B00005JKBC|3.0|Spy Game is a good-looking movie, in the sense that the settings are interesting and that it's fun to watch Robert Redford and Brad Pitt; naturally, the film works best when Muir (Redford) and Bishop (Pitt) are in the same scenes, as when Muir indoctrinates Bishop into the world of a CIA operative or later during their falling out when Muir thinks Bishop has compromised his position by falling in love with an unsuitable woman. Unfortunately, the film didn't make the case for love and the character of the woman is extremely underwritten. Also, Redford tells a lot of the story in flashbacks as he's sitting in a conference room with his sinister CIA bosses, but I thought this muddied the drama and confused the action without adding much.<br /><br />Two commentary tracks are available with the dvd -- one by the director and one by the producers.  Reading between the lines of various comments, it seems obvious they had two high maintenance actors on their hands!  ('Brad wanted to reshoot this scene,'  'Robert wanted to do this.' etc etc)  Must have been a lot of fun!  Still, these are two charismatic actors and it's fun to watch them work.  (Do you suppose Pitt had something to say about the slo-mo shots of him framing the pivotal scene of carnage and destruction?  -- 'Yes, people are hurt and there are explosions, but let's slow it down here so we can see that Brad is really emotionally distraught -- and his hair is blowing so nicely in the wind!')<br /><br />Extra features also include icons that appear and allow you to access trivia or comments while the film plays; a trailer; a list of CIA requirements; a three minute script-to-storyboard featurette; 5 deleted scenes; and 4 alternate scenes, including an alternate ending.  These are fun to watch, but also should act as a warning that there was not a coherent vision of how this film should play out.  In addition, all three commentators spend a fair bit of time explaining the plot -- not a good sign either!  Though I have to say that I enjoyed the film more after listening to the commentary tracks, ultimately it was not worth the effort. Audio tracks are in English or French, and subtitles are English closed-captioning or Spanish.joyed the film more after listening to the commentary tracks, ultimately it was not worth the effort.

0060955775|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing books that I've read.  I read it in one sitting (something I did not expect to do).  The book is not about suicide, as it seems... it's about living, and *learning* to live.  It is a beautiful, tragic miracle, and I would recommend it to anyone who cares to read it.
B00005JLYU|2.0|These 3 ladies had alot of fun making this sequel, as they did with the first one (Charlie's Angels 2000), however you might not have as much fun watching it. The over load of action does not make up for the lack of story. And get this.. the villian is played by Gumby wearing a Demi Moore mask. I even noticed some wires that failed to be edited out. Here is the plot in one sentence. Two rings must come together. Sorry but I forgot why. It just wasn't worth remembering. I thought that director McG did a pretty good job with the first, but he simply over did everything with this one. You've heard of an artist spashing on a little color and he ends up with a masterpeice. But if he doesn't know when to stop he ruins it. This is where the ignorant saying \\"Less is more\\" comes in to play. Better luck with CA3.
0345457684|5.0|This novel is in the classic genre of the private eye story -- a tough guy who's operated inside the law, outside the law and at the edges, and he seems most comfortable at the edges.  He's quick with his fists or his weapons and he has a sixth sense of danger.  But of course despite the hard core he has a soft spot or two.<br />Even though it fits the hard-boiled detective mold so well, this is a solid, engaging action story, helped by the more-or-less believable setting five hundred or so years from now.  The future setting in a latter-day San Francisco doesn't require us to throw away our sense of the credible --we just have to give the author a limited license to invent.<br />And our hero Kovacs exhibits a great sense of ironic humor, all the while letting us in on his thoughts as he puzzles his way through the twisted plot.  There are no last-minute revelations, nothing we couldn't have known.  We're there with him on a rollercoaster, rooting for the protagonists, mistrustful of the villains and certain only that it's a great trip.
0316666343|5.0|<br />In Alice Sebold's debut novel, The Lovely Bones, emotion emits from each page. From the beginning we are torn by the brutal murder of young Susie Salmon and her perspective of her family's life as she watches from her own personal heaven. We get to know the Salmon family as they cope with their loss and attempt to move on with their lives. We are also filled with a sense of renewal and joy as slowly the Salmon family is urged to move on with their lives and Susie learns to do the same with her after-life.<br /><br />Sebold has produced a very thought-provoking novel that stays with the reader long after they finish. I have recommended this book to many of my friends and teachers. It's truly one of those books that come along every once in a while that is a \\"Must-Read!\\" My only regret about the book is that the beginning is somewhat slow but after the first 50 pages or so it becomes impossible to put down.<br /><br /> My other regret is that I can only give this book five stars when it deserves a hundred! Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of The Lovely Bones today. Five Stars!!!

B00005AQF7|5.0|This is easily the greates rap cd in music history. A classic and no cd collection would be complete without it. It features absolutely no dour songs and even the skits are hilarious. Snoop created this masterpiece in 93 and even today it maintains is greatness.
B00005N5S5|5.0|\\"THE TERMINATOR\\" is probably the best science fiction film about machines ever created and it helped to make Arnold as big as he is.  It's amazingly action-packed and has a very original plot.  The acting is great and so are the special effects, considering this film is from '84.  It's filled with thrills, chills and kick-[butt] action scenes!  Definately buy it, it's worth the money!  You'll have a blast!!!!!
B000066AXC|5.0|This movie told the story so completely that the viewer himself could easily feel, momentarily, just as confused, frustrated, and overall dillusional as Mr. Nash. Russel Crowe did a beautiful job, as did the prducers in making you think that his hallucinations were real and to think that all of the people who knew otherwise were spies. It was so perfectly done that you can actually feel immersed in the insanity. The only thing you can say after having watched it is WOW!
B00008PC2O|5.0|This movie is twice as good as the first film!  The action is constant and the movie never gets the least bit boring.  For a '91 film, the special effects are out of this world!  The T-1000, who can turn to liquid metal, looks so realistic you won't believe it!  As far as the DVD goes...oh my God...It's so good that it must have taken them a month just to create the main menu!  The sound is 10x better than normal DVD and the picture is dead-on with sharp color tones and no grain. Every movie should come out on EXTREME DVD!  It also comes in a nice metal case with the normal DVD case inside.  It's the ultimate DVD of all time and it also has a second disc of special features.  Buy it, you won't be sorry!  Hasta la vista, baby!
B000062YAZ|5.0|I just recently bought this album and since then I've been listening to it over and over and over. From beginning to end each song grabs you by the jugular and refuses to let go and by the time it's over you're left with a feeling like &quot;what the hell was that?&quot; &quot;Man that was awesome&quot; Released in 1986 this album along with Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; are THE essential thrash metal albums. In my opinion &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; edges out Puppets because it's so much more fast and aggresive and that's saying a lot because &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is pretty hardcore itself.<br />The album may not be for everyone but it's and essential buy and an all time classic. Metal fan or otherwise you owe it to yourself to hear this.
6305127638|4.0|In 13 words: Star Trek First Contact is the best film of the \\"Next Generation\\" movies. It has superb plotting, pacing, acting, humor, and the BEST special effects of ANY of the films, even surpassing the newest Star Trek Nemesis. (This is the last Trek movie where the special effects were done by ILM). The only problem with this film is that it could've been the best Trek movie out of them ALL if not for a major pitfall...<br />Basically, the action scenes are way too underdeveloped. Each action scene consists of about 5 (or less) phaser shots and that's it. The ship battle at the beginning is something to behold, but all of the other action scenes just bum out. The zero-gravity battle on the hull of the Enterprise E is VERY SUBDUED compared to the scene read in the script. (In the script, there is a MASSIVE, 10 page battle where Riker and Worf must realign a Quantaum Torpedo and fight off dozens of Borg who are firing at them.) In the move, all we get is a very slow-paced scene where the only highlight is Worf saying \\"A S S I M I L A T E           T H I S ! !<br />Another problem is the ending. It's too dang boring. Picard displays incredible acting ability in a 5 minute scene were he throws stuff around in his ready room and gets ready to make a final stand against the Borg. We get the idea that there's going to be a massive climax, but instead all we get is Data punching a tube and Picard climbing on metal \\"rope things.\\" Not very exciting.<br />If the film had been about 10 minutes longer, (allowing for more action) this would've been a PERFECT STAR TREK FILM. So all in all, if you want a good solid Trek film with good acting, plotting, special effects humor, etc., see this one. I you want to see a Trek film with tons of action and a massive climax, I suggest you see Nemesis instead. <br />Don't get me wrong: I'm a trekkie and I own all of the Trek movies. First Contact is one of my all-time favorite Star Trek movies, but it just left me with a little bit more tobe desired. <br />1996; 111 minutes; RATED PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, brief strong language, some sexual content, and disturbing/scary images

0380778556|5.0|All I have to say is wow. I watched the Alfred Hitchcock version of this movie in my English class before I knew about the book. The book and the movie are different in some ways, but hands down, the book is better. Exactly how every other review summarizes the book is how I would put it too. I think one of the reasons people like this book so much is because besides the fact that it's so intriguing and written beautifully, we can all relate to the unnamed narrator in how she feels at times and how she overcomes it. This book gives answers at the end, but at the same time, leaves you guessing, which is perfectly left wide open for a sequel. (which, I can't wait to read.) The movies made from this book that I know about are the Alfred Hitchcock version, and a BBC version and a mini series that aired in the 80's or 70's. I intend to watch every one of them.
0375823360|2.0|Words of warning - 'The Golden Compass' (1st in the series) and 'The Amber Spyglass' (3rd) are nowhere near as good as 'The Subtle Knife' (2nd). In 'The Golden Compass' we are stuck with Lyra, a dim-witted, uncharismatic girl with no personality. Though Lyra is supposed to be the hero, she posseses none of the qualities that would suggest so. She is not brave, noble or cunning. The more exciting parts of this book do not even involve Lyra. She, in fact, runs away as a reaction to tough situations. Her one redeeming quality is that she quickly learns how to read the alethiometer, an ancient device shaped like a pocket watch that helps her answer difficult questions and sometimes predict the future. Lyra's travel companion, Iorek Byrson, the talking armored polar bear, is a much more interesting character. It is he who is involved in the most exciting part of the book - a high stakes fight with another armored bear.     But even with Lyra's shortcomings as a hero, she still garners sympathy merely because she is a kid who has would-be assassins tailing her everywhere she goes. Also, she finds out who her parents are and with sketchy evidence she can't figure out which one is sending out minions to kill her. In the 2nd book 'The Subtle Knife,' it was with great relief to me that Lyra became more or less of a sidekick to the ever-compelling and mysterious Will Parry. With Will cutting openings from one world to another with the instrument called the Subtle Knife, there is no shortage of heart-pounding twists and turns.     I have often heard His Dark Materials being compared to Harry Potter, but Philip Pullman is not as consistent as J.K. Rowling is with Harry Potter. While Rowling has continually exceeded expectations with each Harry Potter book (each book being better than the one before it), Philip Pullman is horribly disappointing with the 3rd book, 'The Amber Spyglass.' At 500+ pages, 'The Amber Spyglass' could've used a lot of editing. The action doesn't really get going until at least 300 pages into it. It doesn't help that many of the longest chapters are centered around Dr. Mary Malone and her useless trek into a land where she befriends some mysterious beasts. I thought Lyra was uncharismatic, but Mary Malone is a thousand times worse. Even the enigmatic Will Parry could not save the slow plot. In one last ditch effort to soften readers up to Lyra, Pullman brings back a few of her travel companions from the first book, who by this time have been separated from her and now wish to find and protect her. Though Lee Scoresby and Iorek Byrnson both express to others that they love Lyra as a daughter, the two showed no affection of this sort while they were with her in the first book. This just seems odd and ill-placed. At the end of 'The Amber Spyglass' I felt like I'd been tricked into reading three anti-Christianity books disguised as an adventure series for children.  Of course the first two books in the series end without a final resolution, but when it happened at the end of the third book, I was disappointed to say the least.
B00008K7AM|5.0|This is by far, one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! You will be laughing out loud! The jokes never get old, as I watched it 3 times in a row and it was still hilarious! A definite must see/buy!!
B000002HAF|5.0|The editorial review provided to you by Amazon offers a fair description of the sounds and quirks and quips of the Pixies first full length masterpiece, \\"Surfer Rosa\\", but it hardly does the record justice. \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is arguably the finest rock album recorded in the last twenty years. It's pure, unflinching ferocity is unparrelled, and The Pixies uncanny knack for melodic chaos set the standard for nearly every watered down version of themselves, (coined by most as \\"alternative music\\") for the next fifteen years.<BR>    The record serves up it's cranking, frantic story in Black Francis' quivering, barking, screaming voice, backed gloriously by Mrs. John Murphy, with her not-quite-cute-but-not-quite-smoldering background antics that were scarce and sorely missed in subsequent Pixies albums. Joey Santiago's guitar is all over the place, soaring crazily alongside Francis' vocals in and out of the stratosphere at a dizzying and lip-curling pace. These tactics are so relentlessly raw that they hurt your fillings and make you wince. These are the songs you sing along with in your car by yourself with spit flying out of your mouth and the look of a psycho killer on your face. Even in the record's lighter shades; tracks such as \\"Where Is My Mind\\", and \\"Gigantic\\",  there is an air of violence and distorted mayhem that is undeniably wretched, sad, playful,sleek, and rotten all at once. As Francis and Santiago go galavanting about the sonic galaxy, they are lovingly if reluctantly anchored by the flawless rhythm of Deal's bass and Lovering's drums. No song displays this complimentary duel better than \\"Vamos\\", reportedly one of the band's favorite songs, and often their encore at live performances.<BR>   But it really isn't all barking and snot. What is ever-present, and one of the things that made The Pixies so special is the method behind the madness. The melody and beauty just under the surface is probably the music's most alluring ingredient, and what keeps us at the record store hoping to see the latest Pixies \\"b-sidereissuelivecuts\\" record. While this pop-hook harmony and texture is not as prominent in \\"Surfer Rosa\\" as in \\"Doolittle\\", or even \\"Bossa Nova\\", it is presented to us here in raw form, being most recognized in wonderful songs such as \\"River Euphrates\\" and \\"Brick Is Red\\".<BR>    Thematically and lyrically,\\"Surfer Rosa\\" is as simultaneously brutal and irresistable as its sound. In this we get indecipherable layers of social innuendo, violence, childhood, insanity, and whimsical commentary. \\"I was talkin' to Peachy Peach about Kissy Kiss/ He bought me a soda and tried to molest me in the parking lot..\\" Is matter-of-factly presented to us in the album's open track \\"Bone Machine\\", along with all the odd-ball, cryptic narrative you can cram into one song. Intriguing, however unintelligable, this trend doesn't curb at all as you stomp over to \\"Break My Body\\". \\"...I'm a building jumper/roof to roof/see my body in the air/break my body/hold my bones...\\" These lyrics are compelling to no end, but lead you absolutely nowhere, and you stop trying by the time \\"Got Something Against You\\" (those being the only lyrics) has had something against you. When the final note  in \\"Broken Face\\" is humming away, you are more than ready for what many consider the records highlight, \\"Gigantic\\". Kim Deal, then headlined as Mrs. John Murphy, sweetly takes you into her playful darkness and in a way makes you wish that Kim sang ALL the songs. Until, of course, \\"River Euphrates\\" wails through your speakers and you are rudely reminded how necessary and vital Francis' vocals really are. As the record continues on its bizarre adventure, it displays a perfect range of emotional turmoil and eclectic nuances, while never getting too big for it's own good.<BR>   On the tip, \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is a road sign signaling the way toward the monster pop-punk alternative rock of 1991 and beyond. But in the big picture, this \\"small blip on the radar\\" of a record is a true icon, a gem in a sea of dull rocks...absolutely essential to the fan of raw, original rock music. \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is to a purist a perfect record, boasting its flaws and fueling itself with energy and raw power that is so rare in rock music. What most artists seem to do so wrong on almost any album you have the misfortune to hear, The Pixies did right with \\"Surfer Rosa\\".
0962477060|3.0|I bought this book along with another basic music theory book. I find parts of it to be helpful - especially the second half. But, I am not sold on it. I really think that learning the theory first is important. Applying theory to guitar is the next step. I think that you will become a better musician if you work through applications on your own or with a good teacher. That way, alternate tunings will make sense and other instruments will make sense. Once you understand the theory, patterns will emerge and it will start making sense. This book makes a decent reference during that process, but it can also slow you down. At the price, however, it's probably not a waste - you should be able to find some insight that you can use.
0393057658|1.0|Very interesting indeed but quite misleading to anybody outside of baseball.  It should be pointed out that the biggest reason for the A's success is strong scouting and player development that has produced the core group of players like Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, Tejada, Chavez, etc.  These guys weren't picked based on some computer printout or webpage, they were selected by their scouting dept. and are now the core of the team.  Rick Peterson is also one of the best young pitching coaches in the game and deserves credit.  He barely got mentioned in the book.  Somehow I don't think that this book came out how Billy Beane would have wanted it to and I would venture to say he is somewhat embarassed.  Sure, Hatteberg and Bradford are great signings but only two examples and the team isn't built around them.  The draft strategies being emloyed now by Oakland are due to baseball economics and highly risky.  We won't know until years down the road wether some of these drafts are a success or a failure.  The statistical info. is a neat little discovery by the computer people and Bill James, etc. but it is given far too much credit in the book for the success of Oakland.
B0000075ZB|5.0|I've been listening to this album for 20 years, ever since Gary Mckee in Atlanta played the title track over and over.  I had never heard anything like the swirling melody on the lyric, 'suddenly everything I ever wanted' and the hiccup syncopation of the opening vocal still makes me smile.  <br />Through the years, I came to like the other tracks as well.  'Yours' is as strong a ballad as I've ever heard and Dionne's playful improvisation at the end of 'Take the Short Way Home' drive me to dance.  <br />These songs are everything a pop song should be:  simple, predictable, yet clever and memorable.  But they are also challenging especially in rhythm.  Pay attention to the bass line in 'You are my Love'.  The syncopation is so off the beat in so many different ways that it's hard to imagine how the player pulled it off, yet it still manages to drive the tune and makes you move.<br />Don't have this cd?  Get it.  I promise it'll delight and entertain you for years to come.
B000065U1N|2.0|So this film is better than Scott's _Gladiator_, which isn't saying much, _Gladiator_ being up there with _Rocky_ and _The Greatest Show on Earth_ as films least deserving of Best Picture, and it has a good cast including Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Orlando Bloom, Sam Shepard, and Tom Sizemore, but if I had been one of those rangers, I'd feel insulted by this movie, despite the tribute to the fallen officers at the end, which seem more to give the picture clout.  Note only the Americans who died are listed, and none of the over 1000 Somalis.  Just who was this war about, anyway?<br />This is one of the worst war movies ever made. It's 2 hours of video game action and 5 minutes of character development, and 10 minutes of credits. All the best war movies let you get to know the characters, and this does it less than the most stereotypical films, do, and only then in the worst way possible, in the form of what Stanley Kubrick called the \\"mandatory\\" scenes he and his source novel avoided in _Full Metal Jacket_. That created a film with much richer characters and much more believable fights in just under 2 hours. _Black Hawk Down_ has none of what made _Full Metal Jacket_, or _Platoon_, or _Catch-22_, or _MASH_, or _Three Kings_, or _No Man's Land_, or even Armando Crispino's _Commandos_ so good. In _Full Metal Jacket_, the Viet Cong were an unseen enemy. Here, the Somalis are the evil hordes of _Dawn of the Dead_, a mass of savages, or \\"skinnies\\" as they're called, who are there to be slaughtered in a war that was supposed to help the people. The few Somali we see as more than cannon fodder are melodramatic villains ill-befitting a realistic film about war.<br />None of the necessary irony that a failed mission needs to have comes through, nor any of the tragedy. Since we don't get to know these people at all, Scott goes the Paul Verhoeven route by having them die the most gruesome ways possible--getting halved, a severed finger, an exploding body that looks straight out of _Dawn of the Dead_ (why is Scott getting good work when Romero is getting DTV?).<br />When someone is severely abused by the system, such as Alex Murphy in Verhoeven's _RoboCop_, a gruesome death can work effectively as a means for gaining sympathy, but routine horrific war violence has minimal impact without giving good definition to the characters who are being harmed. _Saving Private Ryan_ gave us graphic war violence, even if some of it was a little over the top (the guy picking up his own arm in a lame reference to Kurosawa's _Ran_, which probably should have been snipped), but it gave us characters to focus on who were viewing on this, and we learned more about them as the film progressed, and even while it relied on the tired one-of-each style, they were fleshed-out characters. These are ciphers.<br />On the technical point, the CGI is far less noticeable than it is in _Gladiator_. The artificiality of all the scenes made that film feel like a video game because of the look, even though the bad writing was pure Hollywood. This film is a live-action video game with \\"cinema scenes\\" to advance the story. All of this exemplifies why Jerry Bruckheimer productions [stink] and why he ought to be involved in video game development. His style is inherently distancing since it fits in so well with interactive media, and watching video games without playing them is rarely exciting for me anymore, and this film was unrelenting tedium. Maybe I grew up and Bruckheimer didn't. Scott should have known better, but he was never that great a director, and it's all been downhill for him since _Blade Runner_, despite the honors he has undeservedly received. Maybe Bruckheimer picked him because he shares his first name with a space pirate in the _Metroid_ video games, since video games are all he seems to understand.<br />Almost everyone I know had a similar reaction to this film, but it kept coming up in my Amazon ratings, and got largely good reviews, so I gave the film alook. Critics have to watch hundreds of films a year, and so perhaps they'd be best equipped to compare due to having that broader knowledge base. Why this picture struck so many so strongly when so many war films in recent memory are so much better I don't understand. Perhaps the convergence of cinema and video games has become so strong that what I regard as tastelessness and simple-mindedness is now regarded as classy. The extra star is for the cast that had to be in this dreck with barely functional lines and for the use of color, particularly greens, Scott imbues on it.
B000099T2L|3.0|I dont really think that she shuld have would a whole album on her Jay-Z episodes. And &quot;Signs&quot; should have been called sagittarius and the other signs.
B00005JM09|5.0|Those who tried to seal the fate on T3 before even seeing it are eating crow right about now.  Terminator 3 was awesome.  The special effects were used to perfection.  Compared to The Matrix Reloaded, which is heavily laden with CGI, T3 is a nice change of pace.  Of course this couldn't have come together with such brilliance without the master Stan Winston.  The movie plot is similar to the previous Terminator films, but the newest terminator (the terminatrix or TX) has a few new tricks up its sleeve.  All in all, the movie is fantastic, from beginning to end.  I recommend it, and I can't wait for the DVD to be released.
B00005YXZH|3.0|I'm astounded by all the reviews that suggest it takes a while to \\"get\\" this album (maybe so, if you're so used to listening to Britney Spears that your gentle ears can't handle anything other than an A-B-A-B-C song structure). <BR>Because of their boring conventionality, Wilco slinked by unnoticed and unworthy until Jim O'Rourke took pity on them and taught Jeff how to arrange a song in those crazy, newfangled ways of his. New convert Jeff is now coming up with equally crazy stuff like Loose Fur...I guess Wilco fans are going to have to get used to listening more than once to decide if they like an album or not (actual thinking may be required)!<BR>Quit listening to your Zebra (!!!!!) albums over and over again and challenge yourselves!! <br />PS...Anyone who thinks David Lee Roth is still relevant and Zebra was ever any good shouldn't be allowed to write reviews
B000000W5B|4.0|This release begins and ends poorly (Dancing with Mr. D and Star Star), but everything in-between is good with some of it bording on great. It's on my top 5 Stones original release list, with Aftermath perhaps heading the list. Goat's Head is part of the Mick Taylor era, and so that means a more melodic guitar sound.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This movie is the most \\"weldon movie\\" in the last 20 yrs.  A masterpiece sculpted by Martin Scorsese.  You get drawn in to the characters; you feel there hate, love, racism, and music.  The dvd does it all.  It's in superbit and takes up two disc for the whole movie.  Colors glow especially when there throwing vegetables at the theater, that's HDTV 480 progressive.  The fireworks, and the vivid clothing.  It's the best video and bonus material on a DVD.  The audio is up there with Attack of the Clones and Moulin Rouge.  I bought it for 15 at Ciruit City.  A must for your DVD collection.

B0000640VO|5.0|I'm learning french so I figured &quot;Amelie&quot; would be a great movie to watch to improve my fluency.  It did more than that, it also broadened my horizons as a writer.  I didn't know anything so unique was possible.  This is a masterpiece!  Audrey Toutou's heartfelt performance as a lonely young woman proved that we'll be watching more of her in the next many years.  Why did &quot;Amelie&quot; lose the Oscar for Best Foreign Film over the boring &quot;No Man's Land&quot;?  Nobody knows.
0446310786|5.0|This book was very well written!  It is yet the best book I have ever read.  Harper Lee is a wonderful author!  This book made me want to keep turning the page, and never put the book down.  Atticus never once gave up on that case.  Even though it ruined his reputation he kept at it.  It showed me that sometimes you may be rediculed for something, but keep at it.  Fighting for what you believe in is the theme of this book in my opinion.  When Scout and Jim found the items in the tree it showed them that someone cared.  I recommend this book for anyone who is up for a great classic book.  It isn't too long of a book, and it leaves you amazed.  It puts a thought into your head that I cannot describe.  It shows that we all face humility at some points in our lives, but to face those points with courage and bravery.  Look life in the face.
B00006L90T|4.0|First saw this movie on tv late one night about 25 years ago. Made an indelible and lasting impression on me. The acting and direction etc. were pretty average but somehow it didn't seem to matter. It was the way the story unfolded that left the mark. Probably best seen without knowing the plot but I will still be getting this one because, in its own way, it is memorable. Along with Julie Harris in the &quot;The Haunting&quot; and Deborah Kerr in &quot;The Innocents&quot; this film has always held a special place in movies that have really physically unsettled me while I was watching them. Definitely dark room, very late, by yourself, viewing. :)
0151008116|5.0|I'm amused by the (very few) dismissive reviews posted here of this remarkable book. It is clear from their complaints the readers did not make it to the end of the book, or did not &quot;get it&quot; if they did. While several reviews make comparisons to The Old Man and the Sea, for me, this book summons visions of another classic survival novel: Cold Mountain. Let me give a hint to those who may read the first few pages and wonder what all the fuss is about; why this book gets such rave reviews: Enjoy the slow pace. Enjoy the people Pi meets and the lessons he learns from his family and religious mentors. Read with interest his descriptions of zoos and animal behavior. Of fast animals and slow. Of theology and understanding. It will all make sense later. And don't worry. This story has a happy ending.
B0000640SA|4.0|This is an awesome movie, a must-see for anyone who enjoys a story that requires some mental investment on the viewer's part.  And this 2 DVD set has some great features on it (including the ability to watch the scenes in reverse...err...chronological order).  However, the DVD menus are so unintuitive that they're really frustrating.  It's amusing that they decided to model the menus after an aspect of the movie, but doing so makes it too easy to miss many of the features on the discs, or two difficult to find features you're looking for.  Nearly all of the features are essentially Easter Eggs.  Still, I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD set.  There are many websites that expose DVD Easter Eggs, and most of them will tell you exactly how to get to the features on these two discs.
0156027321|2.0|At its base this is an extraordinary story of how a boy and a Bengal tiger survived at sea, alone for seven months.  But however courageous and persevering the protagonists, the tale is gruesome.  The tiger and boy survive, but the carnage is rampant.  Far from &quot;making one believe in God&quot; (per dust jacket), it is more likely you will experience the fear of God.  This is a tale of survival--grim, brutal, and violent.  The violence is overwhelming; so much so that I came to the point where I dreaded to turn the page, not knowing what violent wrenching carnage would occur next.<BR>I respect the fact that survival in these circumstances is brutal.  But the story is told with little compassion and is almost bestial in nature.  It is man at his lowest ebb, man as beast, man devoid of God.  The idea and plot line are exceptional, but the execution is cold, violent, and base.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's long anticipated new CD both shocked and pleasantley surprised me. Although her new, more controversial image has driven some of her fans away, I actually like her better. The music on her CD is absolutely phenomenal. From wild, party-type tracks such as Dirrty and Get Mine, Get Yours to chilling ballads like Walk Away and I'm Ok...all the songs on this CD are great! Christina has matured vocally and in her musical expression as well. This CD is so much better than her first release. It's deeper, more personal and obviously reveals the real Christina. I look forward to more music from her in the future.<br />Favorite Songs:<BR>Can't Hold Us  Down<BR>Walk Away<BR>Beautiful<BR>Dirrty<BR>The Voice Within<BR>I'm Ok
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's most recent production is all you have heard about it and more. How else could a new album have gathered over 300 reviews in less than two weeks after its release? The only possible answer is: we are in front of another classic. Just like some of the band's previous works, it takes time to build on you, but once it grabs you, it doesn't let go: it's addicting. The album has a lot to offer, ranging from very mellow, downbeat melodies all the way to tracks that come with a dose of rage for you to let go of it all. The opening track literally takes the listener on a roller coaster ride, with an unsuspecting intro that leads into vertigo-packed ups and downs, and what feels like a leap into the void, to close out the song... \\"Sit down\\", a very aptly named second song follows suit, with a similar structure, gradually progressing from an eerie and almost silent background to a complete chaos that leads in very nicely into a song filled with peace: \\"Sail to the Moon\\". If there is a place where the band resembles Pink Floyd (like some people say) in this album, this is it... I can totally picture myself rowing inside a boat on my way to the moon when I listen to this song (no, I am not on drugs as I write this -don't ask me why I wrote that). I highly recommend to play it while on the road, at night, with your car windows down, on a starry night -Lovely!<br />After a much deserved rest provided by track three, the band takes you on a new trip that resembles more the type of music you heard them produce around their two most recent works, 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' -more electronic beats serving as a background for Yorke's incredible voice and lyrics. And so \\"Backdrifts\\" goes... and comes back to a tune initially acoustic-guitar driven that evolves into the classic Radiohead sound (\\"Go to Sleep\\"): Get the picture by now? These guys are on a royal demonstration on this album: it sure is standing some place between what they did on 'OK Computer' and 'Kid A'  but it is way more. \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" again takes the user into an 'Amnesiac'-type atmosphere, leading further into the dark corners of the album with \\"We suck Young Blood\\" and the electronic-driven \\"The Gloaming\\" sitting there as guardians of that dark forest of sounds.<br />Out of the woods, the band comes playing a 'merrier' \\"There there\\", followed by a rather brief yet powerful guitar-driven tune filled with sadness (\\"I will\\"). \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\", a generally downbeat song, is very accessible and could become the commercial hit of the album without too much trouble. As far as \\"Myxomatosis\\" goes (a song named after a highly lethal  disease affecting rabbits), to this day still I have a hard time dealing with it: it is the one song in the album I could live without. Ironic that it would be followed by \\"Scatterbrain\\", my favorite: a tune capable of stirring up emotions left and right and making you cry without you noticing it. Closing the album is \\"A Wolf at the Door\\", a very special song that sounds like the background music to a Tarantino violent scene... yet doesn't have any of its violence, but a rather amusing quality.<br />As a final note (a little gift for those of you who read all through the entire review), take a peek at the updated Radiohead web site......

B00006FDCD|4.0|First of all, let me say that this IS NOT a bad film. However, it IS just like every other Stephen King movie in existence. To explain it, the Stephen King movie system is a three-step process:<br />1. All of his movies start like a house afire. It keeps you on your toes, just wondering what he'll give you next. You're entertained, you're scared, you're thinking this is going to be a great film. But keep in mind, this is ONLY the beginning.<br />2. The middle of all Stephen King flicks seem to sag, throwing you in a new direction, giving you things you don't understand and wished they had explained it earlier. This part of the film is usually boring.<br />3. The last forty-five minutes. These forty-five minutes are famous for their speed. All of a sudden, out of the blue, in the middle of nowhere, the film scurries around tying up loose ends and rushing through to reach the end which is usually mediocre.<br />\\"It\\" follows the same sequence of events I have just explained. In the beginning, the murder of a child, the finding of the picture, the appearance of the clown, and the history of the children are all thrilling and scary. The middle, when everyone meets, is a bit slow and keeps you wondering when it will start up again. The last forty-five minutes desperatley tries to make everything sensible (which isn't possible with a killer clown).<br />Overall, \\"It\\" is worth watching and then watching again to understand it all. Rent it, buy it, whatever.
0790743523|5.0|Bogart at his best.  John Huston at his best.  The cast of characters were perfect for the story.  This is one of the few westerns I own.  The story is greed and its result.  The story is old as time.  The story &amp; film are worth it.  Buy it!

0790743132|5.0|This is one of the best all time movies!  If you don't own it, you should.  The characters are GREAT!  I have yet not to tear up at the end.  I watch it about twice/year.  This is better than what is put out today as a love story.  You will not be disappointed.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead is a better than average band but they sound quite a bit like Porcupine Tree and it always blows my mind that Radiohead gets all the press while the superior Porcupine Tree gets very little. Proof that it's all about politics. Anyone who likes Radiohead would do well to listen to the real McCoy...start with In Absentia and work backwards. Lightbulb Sun, Stupid Dream, and Signify are all deliciously tasty.
B0000011P7|3.0|&gt;Ian Anderson's 1st solo album,well what's so different about that, virtually every Tull album since Mick Abrahams [sic] <BR>departure is an Ian solo album.<br />Technically a solo album is an album with a single performer like Bob Dylan's first several albums, like Glenn Gould's [note apostrophe] Bach Goldberg Variations. This then is a duo, and that WAS a significant departure (speaking of departures) for Ian Anderson at the time. It's true that starting with &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, there was much less band interaction in Jethro Tull, but &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Benefit&quot;, and &quot;Aqualung&quot; have more band interaction than Mick Abraham's &quot;This Was&quot;. (That Mick Abraham sang on and wrote songs for &quot;This Was&quot; is immaterial and irrelevant.)<br />&gt;Of course this had to happen in the early 80's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one's no exception. Like The Human League with a flute player. <br />Actually, the synthesizers are the best thing about this album. The SONGS are the problem. Ian Anderson's lyrical and musical ideas were few and meager. (And please don't mention The Human League in the same breath. The Human League was an abomination.)
B000001DTM|4.0|One of the more unique things about U2 as a band was their decision to completely redefine their sound going into the 1990s. Gone from this album was the raw guitar driven rock that had driven the band's sound in the 1980s. From the first track &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, the band announces its complete change in style by announcing it was ready for the future, both of the band's sound and the changing scope of world affairs in 1991 (one thing to not totally disappear from the band's music was the political undertones). Bono's lyric-writing is at the top of its game, and Brian Eno's production, combined with Flood's engineering, are superb. The album's two main singles &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; are still rightfully two very popular U2 songs. Overall this is an excellent album, and definately an essential U2 album to have.
B00005AQE8|5.0|i give this cd 5 stars cause it got nice songs on it and ofcorse im gonna give it 5 stars king of rap made it so its the best.
B000001EAQ|3.0|Many U2 fans would like to just forget that this album ever happened. Pop. The electronica experiment. It was, in many regards, an album with a half-finished sound, songs that could be so much more than they were, but were not. The music is very light and at times sparse, and full of electronic sounds. In many ways, this was the band's attempt at a proper pop type album, but it does not work so very well. However, there are gems to be found. Dischteque is a great dance/pop song, If God Will Send His Angels is enjoyable in an etheral way, and Staring at the Sun is also a nice down-tempo kind of tune. While a true U2 fan will find enjoyment in this album's better gems, many casual listeners will probably find more enjoyment in the band's other work.
B00000AOUD|3.0|Am i the only one who wishes that this album was split into different songs? Oh well, on with the review. <br />I never REALLY got into Jethro Tull. I had Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, and Stand Up. What I liked about the other 2, is that the songs were short and sweet. This album seems to go on forever, even for a 43-minute epic. (And yes, I do listen to long songs and love them, like Yes's Close To The Edge and ELP's Tarkus) It seems that Jethro Tull wanted to put in all the quirkiness and all the weird poetry they knew, and focused less on writing. I don't know why, but this just doesn't work for me. The first half is fine, but it starts to die down with revised ideas and stupid LONG parts near the end. I like the orchestrated parts and the ending in the 2nd part, but it's kind of dull. People should start with Stand UP, Benefit, or Aqualung before this album. End review.
B000002J1O|4.0|This isn't my favorite Genesis album, but it's probably the best one to try if you're new to the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis.  It's more immediately accessible than the others, which take several listens to get used to.  The album contains two songs that make the short list of Genesis' all-time best, \\"Firth of Fifth\\" and \\"I Know What I Like (in Your Wardrobe)\\", the production is pretty good, guitarist Steve Hackett plays some of his best solos, especially  on \\"Firth of Fifth\\", and Tony Banks had just bought his first synthesizer, which provides ear candy throughout.  Banks has made a career out of finding endless ways to make keyboard solos out of arpeggios -- \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is his best ever.  \\"I Know What I Like\\" was Genesis' first notable single; the lyrics were inspired by a painting Gabriel saw at an exhibition, which became the album?s cover.  \\"More Fool Me\\" is a ballad notable only because it featured a rare lead vocal by the drummer, a fellow named Phil Collins.  The second half of the album consists of two 12-minute songs sandwiched around a pleasant instrumental, \\"After the Ordeal\\".  \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" relates the most twee gangland war on record; both Banks and Michael Rutherford admit in Armando Gallo's \\"I Know What I Like\\" book that while the music and lyrics to the song are both strong, the two just don't fit well together.  \\"The Cinema Show\\" consists of two segments; the second half is a fantastic instrumental in 7/8 time spotlighting Banks' synth, the first half is an acquired taste.  The best way to tell a TRUE Genesis fan is to see if they can sit through the first half of \\"Cinema Show\\"; I've met some fair-weather fans who hit the wall during the acoustic instrumental between the two choruses.  The song uses the dual 12-string acoustic guitar sound that was a staple of early Genesis, coupled with a lyric on gender issues that name-drops the Greek mythological figure Tiresias, history's first sex change.  \\"Cinema Show\\" ends with \\"Aisleof Plenty\\", a brief reprise of the melody from \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\", the first of many times when Genesis would reprise the first song of an album at its end.  As on most progressive rock albums of the 70s, the lyrics on \\"Selling England\\" can get a little silly; if you can get through the first 20 seconds of the album, you've weathered the worst of it.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B000002TQV|4.0|After the bad 1st impression we got on Pablo Honey, Radiohead started anew with one of the best albums of 1995. This is the beginning of the sound that Radiohead is known for. There are mostly guitars on this, but here they just started experimenting with electronics. Planet Telex is a good example. It could be mistaken for Bjork. That is, until you hear Thom's whiny yet also beatiful voice. The best songs are High and Dry, a very catchy alternative song, Fake Plastic Trees, their most known single, Nice Dream, a very moody song with a killer guitar break, Just, a very good rock song, and Street Spirit, the sad ender.<br />So, why 4 stars? 3 songs bother me. Bulletproof is out of place. We don't need another acoustic song. There's about 5 on the album. Black Star is too early 90's R.E.M to me (I never liked them), and I never got into Sulk. But it's still a fine album, and a great starting point.
B00000DOZJ|4.0|This isn't my favorite Genesis album, but it's probably the best one to try if you're new to the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis.  It's more immediately accessible than the others, which take several listens to get used to.  The album contains two songs that make the short list of Genesis' all-time best, \\"Firth of Fifth\\" and \\"I Know What I Like (in Your Wardrobe)\\", the production is pretty good, guitarist Steve Hackett plays some of his best solos, especially  on \\"Firth of Fifth\\", and Tony Banks had just bought his first synthesizer, which provides ear candy throughout.  Banks has made a career out of finding endless ways to make keyboard solos out of arpeggios -- \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is his best ever.  \\"I Know What I Like\\" was Genesis' first notable single; the lyrics were inspired by a painting Gabriel saw at an exhibition, which became the album's cover.  \\"More Fool Me\\" is a ballad notable only because it featured a rare lead vocal by the drummer, a fellow named Phil Collins.  The second half of the album consists of two 12-minute songs sandwiched around a pleasant instrumental, \\"After the Ordeal\\".  \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" relates the most twee gangland war on record; both Banks and Michael Rutherford admit in Armando Gallo's \\"I Know What I Like\\" book that while the music and lyrics to the song are both strong, the two just don't fit well together.  \\"The Cinema Show\\" consists of two segments; the second half is a fantastic instrumental in 7/8 time spotlighting Banks' synth, the first half is...an acquired taste.  The best way to tell a TRUE Genesis fan is to see if they can sit through the first half of \\"Cinema Show\\"; I've met some fair-weather fans who hit the wall during the acoustic instrumental between the two choruses.  The song uses the dual 12-string acoustic guitar sound that was a staple of early Genesis, coupled with a lyric on gender issues that name-drops the Greek mythological figure Tiresias, history's first sex change.  \\"Cinema Show\\" ends with \\"Aisle of Plenty\\", a brief reprise of the melody from \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\", the first of many times when Genesis would reprise the first song of an album at its end.  As on most progressive rock albums of the 70s, the lyrics on \\"Selling England\\" can get a little silly; if you can get through the first 20 seconds of the album, you've weathered the worst of it.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
0385503954|3.0|I wish I had read the Amazon.com reviews before I started this novel because I then could have better calibrated my expectations.  I found \\"Atonement\\" to be long on theme (excellent) but short on flow.   Ian McEwan is an accomplished writer but like so many others I found his book painfully slow.  In truth, it may not have been but very often I had to mentally fight to stay with it.  That may have been because I thought many sections were so uninteresting that I momentarily stopped caring about where the story was headed.  I also found the book's characters lacking any appeal.  Briony was an intriguing but very unsympathetic central character i.e. she just wasn't someone I could care about.       Intellectually I liked the book's powerful theme of an individual's guilt and struggle for redemption.  However, I had to work to get there.  If you don't mind expending a little effort \\"Atonement\\" may strike the right chord in you.  For me it was an interesting but not a very enjoyable read.
6304675348|2.0|Okay, I am a TOTAL &quot;scardey-cat&quot; when it comes to scary movies. Even scary stories! But recently, Ive been trying to see what the big fuss is about this genre and rented a few...&quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, &quot;Prom Night&quot;, and watched a few on t.v. such as &quot;House on Soroity Row&quot; and a couple other &quot;Halloween&quot; films....To be quite honest, I thought ALL of these films were scarier than this...When I rented this, I was excited, and expected to jump out of my seat because it was going to be SO scary! Well...I didnt find this SCARY-OR-FUNNY...I was a little dissapointed about how there were only a couple chase scenes...I could have easily watched this at night (instead of 10:00 a.m., as I chose to do...), and gone to sleep deeply and peacefully...So...WAS this soppoused to be a comedy?!?!?! I didn't find it funny AT ALL! My sister, who I was reccomended this by, saw as more of a comedy...of course, I thought maybe for scary-movie buffs, because they're soppoused to be a lot of refrences to past ones...but shes certainly not one of those! I really just didn't understand what was so funny about it! Looks like I won't be seeing the sequel!
B000001G16|5.0|What a great album! Everyone who loves aor and melodic rock blues has to own this masterpiece. One light burning is one of the best rock ballad I have ever heard. I give it 9 out of 10.
B000002E5J|5.0|I love this album. This album it's so cool! This is my second best Shakira album. I would wish her new album be good as this one.
B000069CWE|5.0|All those hits remixed. How cool is that? This must go in the collection.
B00009L1TA|4.0|A very good thriller! I loved watching this movie. You'll have to watch it twice to understand every bit of it. You'll never guess the ending.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This soundtrack was amazing. It really captures some of the emotions in some of the scenes. The singers have amazing voices. Gollum's song is the most emotional on the soundtrack. It really captures the tragic life Gollum went through (even though my mom doesn't think so). <BR>     Don't listen to reviews similar to the one written by Susan Godley. First off Susan, I agree that the movie and the soundtrack coordinate very well. But, I disagree that the soundtrack doesn't sound good by itself. <BR>     So overall, this soundtrack is just as good as the first.
B00005JM03|5.0|I loved this movie. The mini's are fantastic. I just saw The Italian Job for my third time today. This is a must see. With an all-star cast including Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Seth Green, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Ed Norton, and Donald Sutherland everything is great in this wonderful movie.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I loved Green Day before Warning, but not as much as I do now after listenign to Warning!<br />1. Warning- Awesome song! Green Day's new sound is summed up in this song. 10/10<br />2. Blood, Sex, and Booze- Kinda out of place but it's still awesome. 9/10<br />3. Church on Sunday- Great song. 10/10<br />4. Fashion Victim- Took me a while to get used to, but still a great song. 9/10<br />5. Castaway- THE 2ND BEST SONG ON THIS CD! I listened to this song 5 times the first time I heard it! 20/10<br />6. Misery- Weird, but great. In this you'll here the mandolin, accordian, and other weird instruments. I loved it the first time I heard it! 10/10<br />7. Deadbeat Holiday- THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD!!! This song has many meanings and as you listen to it more and more you'll think of what else this song could be about. This song never gets old. 100/10<br />8. Hold On- Good song but I don't listen to it much, I usually skip over ti, but it has a great beat. 8/10<br />9. Jackass- Great song. 9/10<br />10. Waiting- GREAT SONG!!! I loved it and listened it over and over and over! 20/10<br />11. Minority- Good song, a little more punk, which is good. 10/10<br />12. Macy's Day Parade- Good ballad. If you liked Good Riddance (Time of your Life) You'll love this. 10/10<br />So all in all, one hell of an awesome CD!
B00008LDPU|3.0|Most of the animation from these shorts is very good. However, their shortness does not allow for a very satisfying pay-off.  If you know the animators and like their work it is worth watching. This is just a taste and it left me wanting more.
B000002KHB|5.0|Richie Blackmore is one of the best guitar players ever and this album shows it! Ian Gillan's voice is amazing! Jon Lord is easly the best keyboard/Organ player in the history of rock! Roger Glover has a great bass touch!  And Ian Psice's drumming is over the top! This album is more then just 'Smoke On The Water' its got some of Deep Purples best work to date! the songs 'Highway Star' and 'Lazy' contain two of Blackmores best guitar solo's ever! 'Space Truckin' is such a stoner song but man does it kick ... it has such an awsome riff, well its not relly a riff but its got freat guitar and the drumming is really out of this world if you catch my drift! 'Maybe I'm A Leo?' this song is great not a bad point about it! 'Pictures of Home' and 'Never Before are great rock classics! Back to 'Smoke On The Water' while I do think this is Purples best songs its not my favorite but it has everything you would want in a rock song the best riff of all time, killer vocals, awsome bass line, great organ, and wicked drumming this album is worth owning just for this song but all the others are great as well. This is Deep Purples Best album! and in my opinion one of the best albums of all time, so pick this up if your a classic metal fan! This album is just as good as anything by Zeppelin, Sabbath, Aerosmith, or even Ac/Dc so get Machine Head!
B000005S6B|5.0|Does Irish soul mixed with a sourmash of punk fill your soul?<BR>Does your heart and feet race to a frenzy when you hear authentic Irish music? If so, get this CD and order a Guinness Stout, sit back and grab a bit of the most soul stirring sounds ever recorded.  See you in Belfast, the drinks are on me.
B000089RVX|5.0|It takes skill to get every song on one album to have it's own charecteristic personality. When I bought this album and listened to it through the first time, and I was hooked. This group has talent that most bands don't. The songs were deep, some even sad; a few actualy made me cry. Others touched my heart. This Is one album You won't regret buying, and a band you will definatly fall for. Like I said they got skill!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Hopefully the influence of the great and tragically under-appreciated At the Drive-In will continue to spread for decades to come. In that band's other offshoot Sparta, ATDI's solid roleplayers have delivered dependable though rather unexciting emo-grunge, projecting ATDI's more down-to-earth side. With the Mars Volta, Cedric Bixler Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, the two progressive and high-flying idea guys, have taken ATDI's experimental side off into the stratosphere. This album is a firestorm of avant-garde experimentation focused on the more outlandish tendencies that were always simmering beneath the surface, but only occasionally erupting, back with ATDI. That includes the bizarre song titles and impossibly dense lyrics jampacked with obscure literary references and esoteric philosophies. Cedric has truly set his remarkable voice free here, with soaring melodies and vocal acrobatics that prove he's one of the greatest (and least heralded) rock singers we've heard in ages. Meanwhile Omar, as main songwriter here, proves himself to be a polymath of musical styles and a master craftsman of emotional sonic architecture and violent mood swings. ATDI-like aggro is still the foundation here, but the other ingredients mixed in are truly astonishing. &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot; adds dense Latin percussion reminiscent of classic Santana, &quot;This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed&quot; is driven by pummeling jazz-fusion polyrhythms, &quot;Televators&quot; is a highly spooky acoustic ballad with plenty of emotional noise, and &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot; approaches scholarly funk. The Mars Volta project is obviously way too far from the mainstream to become a hit (which is a possibility for Sparta), but those of us in the know have been rewarded with a mindboggling musical achievement.
B00006RINF|3.0|In the current world of generock, this CD actually shows some independent thought and style.  But despite the other reviewers breathless praise, it isn't the best CD ever, not even close.  The female vocalist (sorry, their names aren't on the CD) has an excellent voice and a couple of different styles, from operatic to kind of sex kittenish.  Unfortunately the male vocalist is awful, with no range and not very exciting.  It would be much better if they'd just ditch the dual vocalist idea and stick with her.<br />Musically they fall into the progressive rock/pop-metal category, kind of like Jacobs Dream or Queensryche.  The sound is very polished with good production, but the songs get a little monotonous because there isn't enough variety in styles between songs.  \\"Swamped\\" is the song you've probably heard before and it stands out because of its unique structure.  Other songs are good, but often repetitive with predictable switching between vocalists and simple guitar riffs.<br />But I still recommend Comalies because it does offer something different than the sludge on the radio, and while not perfect, is very good and worth owning.  If Lacuna Coil can get a strong producer to improve their song structure, they could be huge.<br />My rating:<BR>***<br />My Scale:<BR>*     Weak, maybe 1 or two good songs, lots of filler<BR>**    OK, throw it in the car or MP3 player for long trips<BR>***   Good, several excellent songs, still needs some work<BR>****  Excellent, a classic that I will listen to for years to come.<BR>***** Awesome.  The entire world will be talking about this album for the next 10 years.
B0000959N0|4.0|This movie worked for me.  I've been reading comics since I could read; and the recent flood of comic book movies has been a great thrill for me and my brothers.  Daredevil was never counted as one of Marvel's top comicbooks although it has been around for some 400 issues.  When the movie came out I wondered how Affleck would do as Daredevil, and to be honest he didn't let me down.  He was just dark enough to bring the feeling of angst and guilt to the audience but not so dark that he would come across as evil or crazy; he left that to the bad guys of the film.  Speaking of which, Duncan (Kingpin) and Ferrel (Bullseye) did a fantastic job!  The Kingpin had all the aura one would expect the leader of the mob to have and Bullseye was, well the psychopath that he was made to be in the comics.  And to add to all the fun, Garner (Electra) does hot, sexy, stunning and awesome all in one fell swoop.  I don't think anyone could have played Electra better.  Combine all of these terrific efforts with a decent story and some outstanding effects and it comes out as a comic book fans dream...a comicbook come to life for two hours.

B00007KWHN|4.0|For any fan of progressive rock, The Yes Album should not be overlooked.  Jon Anderson's voice is sweet and melodic, a perfect complement to Steve Howe's guitar work.  For those who have never heard Howe's guitar playing, let me simply say that every note he plays you hear.  The songs are beautiful, but at times I do think that they drag on a little.  (I can compare this with Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; which never drags.)  I also don't see the point in the other versions of &quot;Your Move,&quot; &quot;Starship Trooper: Life Seeker,&quot; and &quot;Clap.&quot;  With that said, these complaints are minor compared with the quality of musicianship that Yes displays here.  &quot;Clap&quot; is an addictive little song, a different sort of gem among &quot;epic&quot; songs.  &quot;Yours is No Disgrace,&quot; is a perfect opener for the album, while &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; anchors the center of the album.  As I've said earlier, all are good songs that illuminate Yes's musicianship and transcendental philosophy quite clearly.  Listen to it once and I'm sure that you'll return to it again.
0140186409|4.0|I read Grapes of Wrath just out of interest when I saw it sitting on a bookstore shelf, it wasn't part of my school ciriculum or anything of the sort. I found it was not really entertaining and at times it's not really a page turner, but you will want to read till the end to see what happens.<br />The problem I have with GoW is that it repeats the same monotonous message over and over again. The same lesson, the same insight, the same issue. While this may be effective in driving home to the reader the fact that the migrant situation during the depression had a far reaching and catastrophic impact on certain americans and the segregation there was in the community, I just wish I didn't need to know the same details constantly.<br />Steinbeck did do a great job of creating a wonderfully written (sometimes poetic, especially inbetween chapters) story with wonderful characters but I do see areas where there could have been improvement. There is little description in a characters actions or movements. While you may feel what the character is going through, it can be a little more difficult to 'see' whats going on as Steinbeck was sparse with descriptions. If that's his writing style then so be it, I didn't really like that about the novel.<br />GoW throws the reader through problem after problem, with only the strength of will of Tom and his mother keeping the family glued together, you do feel the injustice and hardships that they experienced, and the vain hope that they can obtain a piece of land.<br />The ending is a bit of a mystery to me, I can't quite catch the metaphor in the last scene but I do see how it works overall. Anyway, if you are interested in tasting a bit of classic work, read GoW. You'll come away satisfied.
B000002HRE|4.0|Some people like Load and Re-Load, and some don't. Some who like them are fans of earlier Metallica and some aren't. Some like Load and don't like Re-Load, and vice-versa. If you're not familiar with these albums, there are a few important things you should know about them.<br />First off, you should know that Load and Re-Load are not metal albums.<br />Secondly, though some will try to convince you otherwise, they are not &quot;alternative&quot;. They're just plain rock.<br />Thirdly, between the two albums you can find a plethora of damned good music. You can also find a more than healthy dose of bad music.<br />On Re-Load, specifically, &quot;Bad Seed&quot; is a truly awful song.<br />&quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, however, are great fast hard rock songs that no rock enthusiast should be without. &quot;Fixxxer&quot; is a wonderfully weird song, and although it doesn't have the same sound as pre-black Metallica, it's definitely not what I'd call &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;mainstream&quot;.<br />Also interesting about the Load couplet is the overwhelming country influence on some of the songs. Not the radio-country of today, I'm talking about real country... anyway if you don't know what that means, just have a listen. <br />This is a review for Re-Load but you can't really talk about it without talking about Load at the same time, since Re-Load the second half of what Metallica originally anticipated to be the 2-disc Load. So here's my final impression on both for you: have a listen. That's the only way to know if you'll like them, regardless of whether you're a Metallica fan. However, if your experience with Load and Re-Load is your first with Metallica, and you like them, you should definitely try their older albums as well, because if not you're going to miss out on some truly excellent metal.<br />And another hint: don't waste your money on St. Anger. I like KoRn and Slipknot okay, but Metallica trying to sound like them is pretty ridiculous... and they do a poor job at it.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein is an amazing band and Mutter is a perfect cd. The songs flow into each other and they are placed perfectly in the cd. There are several stand out songs but none are bad. &quot;Mein Hez Brent,&quot; &quot;Links 2,3,4,&quot; &quot;Zwitter,&quot; and &quot;Mutter&quot; are worthy of recognition. If you like Rammstein and this cd, check out Megaherz, another German band very similar to Rammstein.
0679731725|5.0|This is one of those books that  you finish, and  sit there for a few minutes in silence filled with the awareness  that you have just read a truly great novel. Author Ishiguro provides us with the  reminiscences of a stereotypically reserved British butler.  It is 1956, and Stevens is nearing the end of a long, loyal career serving the inhabitants of Darlington Hall. Lord Darlington has died, and an American has purchased the estate.  The once sizable staff of 27 servants has now been reduced to three. Stevens is on a brief motor trip from Oxfordshire to Cornwall to visit the former Housekeeper of Darlington Hall, Mrs. Kenton, and is hopeful of enticing her to return with him to join his small staff.<br />From his musings while traveling we learn that Stevens repressed every aspect of his personal feelings and values in order to do his duty as head of the household staff of the estate. Duty, loyalty and dignity are the sole values that he admits to, and they have governed his life since arriving at Darlington Hall around 1927. While his father dies in an upstairs room he cannot attend to him as he must see to it that nothing goes amiss at a large conference that is underway. His dealings with Mrs. Kenton are cold and formal, though you become increasingly aware that there are feelings developing between them that go beyond those of a usual co-worker relationship. Stevens also feels that his loyal service to Lord Darlington enabled him to play a small, but meaningful role in Lord Darlington's efforts to bring about world peace.<br />As Stevens analyzes the past both he and the reader begin to realize that his defense of  his life is falling apart. He is forced to realize that his blind support of an aristocrat may have been misguided. His denial of feelings have  cost him a relationship with a woman who had fallen in love with him.  Stevens has come ultimately to face the \\"remains of the day\\", that being the remaining years of  his life.<br />The style of this novel is simple and stately. It is filled with an understated eloquence that is spellbinding. This is a reality novel of the mind. For the length of the book we are privy to Stevens's thoughts as he wrestles with them, as he tries to grapple with the disturbing feelings about his life that are bubbling to the surface.<br />Ishiguro is an incredibly talented author.

B000002BFZ|5.0|Pearl Jam struck pure gold with Vs. in the early nineties and they do it again with No Code.  On No Code, the band's fourth full length album there is no resemblance to the arena rock of Pearl Jam's infancy.  Eddie Vedder really reinvented himself on this record, offering the most versatile vocal performances of his career so far, and the other band members are no slouches either.  About half of the songs on No Code are sailing uncharted waters for the band, and each experiment succeeds.  There are tones of folk, the Middle-East, punk, and there's even a spoken word experiment that works.  Each song offers something new and produces one of the rarest virtues of an album: it's eclectic but flows effortlessly from song to song.   <br />After opening with the atmospheric &quot;Sometimes&quot;, the album roars to life with &quot;Hail Hail&quot;, one of Pearl Jam's best rockers.  &quot;In My Tree&quot; is the next highlight, an indescribable tune that simply must be heard to believe.  &quot;Smile&quot; is Neil Young territory, complete with a similar guitar tone and raging harmonica solos.  My personal favorite here is &quot;Off He Goes&quot;, an acoustic song with storytelling lyrics and beautiful music and vocals.  &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; is another classic, and &quot;Present Tense&quot; is the runner up for my favorite song; its quiet, atmospheric beginnings erupt later in the song, creating an emotional experience to say the least.  <br />The essence of No Code can't really be put into words - it truly is an experience.  Often overlooked because none of the songs hit it big with radio, No Code is the band's quiet masterpiece.  While overwhelming upon first listen, each subsequent spin reveals more and more greatness ultimately resulting in Pearl Jam's most rewarding album.  This is definitely not the album for newbies to PJ to get, try Ten or Vs. instead.  But for those who are into the band already, this is a no-brainer.  Bottom line - No Code is another underratedclassic of the nineties.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This touching story of struggle of 3 children against racism to return home along the &quot;rabbit proof fence&quot; is made all that more powerful and touching with the very last scene of this movie.

B00000331V|5.0|Blow Your Face Out should definitly be near the top of the TOP 5 Albums of ALL Time!!!!  Every song is absolutely GREAT. The intro to Musta Got Lost is totally amazing.

I've liked this album since it came out (I wore out 4 copies of the album, thank God for CDs).
B00008DDXC|1.0|Sorry, folks, but I found the movie to be slow moving and very uninteresting.  I guess it's just me, but I don't believe Harry Potter to be that great.  I fell asleep with the movie still in its first hour.  The pace, action, and acting are interesting only to those with less than sophisticated tastes.  This movie could have been (and probably should have been) done in less than 90 minutes.
B00005JM09|4.0|I will admit that I was quite apprehensive about going to see T3.  I had made it a point the week prior to be sure and watch the other two installments of the series (it had been a long time since I had last seen them) so that I would be sure to have my facts straight when they went in and screwed up the James Cameron legacy from T2.  The more I watched, the more nervous I was that things would go badly.  However, when I did finally get to the theater, I was most pleasantly surprised.  The action was incredible, the special effects were stellar, and the story-line was as totally instep with the others.  Here are the specifics:<br />Judgment Day was not prevented at the end of T2, rather it was only postponed.  John Conner, now 19, feels that the ultimate destruction of the earth is inevitable.  Turns out he was right.  A new breed of Terminator (another liquid metal one) shows up in LA and starts assassinating people who will form the leadership of the human resistance since John Conner cannot be found.  A T-800 is also sent back to protect John Conner and the woman who will eventually be his wife in the new world.  From there, the plot is rather similar to that of T2 (Must kill John Conner), but there are a few twists along the way.  The T-800 can't be controlled by Conner, and the new T-X, unlike the T-1000, can form weapons in addition to living tissue.  After the initial chaos and destruction that seems to follow whenever any terminator sees a member of the Conner clan, the decision is made to once again attempt to avert Judgment Day by preventing the SkyNet system from being activated so that it may later be destroyed.<br />While T3 is in many ways similar to its predecessor (and much of it, I believe, is intentional by design, not necessity), there are quite a few differences.  For starters, we learn more about Conner and how he feels about his destiny, and we also find out more about him than he just leads the resistance.  The viewer will also learn a lot more about SkyNet and how Judgment Day came to be.  We will see a limited perspective from the female terminator, not just the T-800.  Additionally, Nick Stahl is made up to at least resemble Michael Biehn from The Terminator, a very important point seeing as how Biehn is his father.  Ultimately, unlike the other two movies, this one defiantly sets the stage for there to be a T4, and based on what we've seen here, I can almost guarantee you that it will not be another Search and Destroy mission against John Conner and his associates.<br />Those who recall T2 with fondness and thought of it as an excellent movie should defiantly consider T3.  They will not be disappointed.  Newcomers to the series will also enjoy the movie as the ultimate plot is easy to pick up thanks to Conner's prologue and epilogues.  Otherwise, the enjoyment factor is hit or miss.  I know Cameron never really intended for there to be a T3, but now that there is one, at least it's good enough to appeal to the general audience, even if some have a pre-conceived distaste for the whole project.about SkyNet and how Judgment Day came to be.

B00006AFUR|1.0|if you've seen this band live you know how bad they truly are.  my friend fell asleep during their set, at a concert! this is a horrible cd
B00005JM09|5.0|Hello Terminator fans, I would like you to know that Rise of the Machines is everything I think you are hoping for.<br /> To be honest I didn't think it would be nearly as good as t2, but in fact I think that it stood up to T2 LIKE NOBODY's BUSINESS.  All the naysayers talking badly about Nick Stahl (NEW JOHN CONNOR) need to wake up and think about this for a second, Ed Furlong(OLD JOHN CONNOR) played Connor as a ten year old, though sorely out of the age range, Connor has changed so much you need a new actor, I think he was awesome.  Also Arnold is better than ever.  Did I mention some of the best R rated humor ever.  <br />I nominate this film in my book, and I have watched many many movies this year, as one of the best films of the year.<br />A WINNER FOR TERMINATOR FANS AND ACTION FILM LOVERS.
B000001FS6|5.0|Buy it and don't think twice.  There are two songs on the record that aren't good: &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot; and &quot;Love Rescue Me&quot;.  Everything else is brilliant in one way or another, and I'm not that easy to impress.  On your first listen, skip to &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and turn it UP.  Amazing.
B000099T2L|4.0|for me personal this cd is better than survivor..she has showed some skills and her voice is beatiful. the best song are signs *the best on the album* that's how you like is cute, baby boy is o.k. be wit you sounds to 70's to me and closer i get to you is good but overall it is a good cd to pop in your car or just to chill and listen to
0783225792|4.0|Although the ending of \\"Casino\\" is not as satisfying as those earlier Scorcese films, the entire film is a wonderful exercise in film editing and directing.<br />Of course, great attention has been paid to the soundtrack, which is occasionally jarring, but mostly fits in well with the action/dialogue.  This particular re-teaming of De Niro and Pesci is less effective than \\"Goodfellas\\", but that stems in part because we've already been there before, and that ride was a lot more fun.  De Niro seems to be walking through his part, and Pesci's aping the same part he played 6 years previously in \\"Goodfellas\\".<br />Much had been made of Sharon Stone's performance, which is the most effective of the three leads, but this is due in part to it being the most unpredictable.<br />\\"Casino\\" runs a bit longer than it should, but it still rewards through repeat viewings.  James Woods in particular steals the movie every time he appears on screen.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I have seen many bands live but the stage presence of &quot;Queen&quot; is something to be learnt from. The camera work and sound production is superb. I have the VHS tape too and the DVD has 8 more songs than the VHS..yoo hoo...<br />This video could be used as an instruction video for doing live concerts....I use it like one for our band's concerts
B000002L9B|5.0|Looking back at the 80s, it almost seems that while one-hit wonders were left back in the dust wondering what happened to their careers, Prince was disdaining his on purpose, all the while creating some of the most memorable music of that decade.<br />Consider this: he went from the grandiose pop/rock fusion masterpiece \\"Purple Rain\\", to the psychedelia tinged \\"Around The World In A Day\\" (which stiffed), and in almost no time at all, made like success wasn't what he was after.  Most people bailed right after the \\"Purple Rain\\" had stopped.<br />That's unfortunate for them, because \\"Parade\\" (unlike the movie it represents), is just as good as anything he'd ever released, and showed all parts of Prince in equal measure; producer, lyrical and musical genius, performer, and ultimately, as an artist.<br />Although \\"Kiss\\" became the sole hit off the album, it's the other cuts that became the basis for a lot of his classic (many of which are bootlegged) live jams.  \\"Sometimes It Snows In April\\" and \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\" would get mixed up with \\"The Question Of U\\", and the '86 tour became notorious for sending up a kicking version of \\"New Position\\".<br />Not as epic as \\"Sign 'O' The Times\\", but just as good.
B000099T2L|3.0|I gave this Beyonce's Dangerously in Love three stars because though the musical and vocal quality are very good (sometimes her exaggerated Texan accent gets on my nerves), most of the songs are not about love but lust.  For instance \\"Naughty Girl\\" is ambiguous on whether or not she is talking about sex or dirty dancing. \\"Baby Boy\\" is another rocker about lusting for some guy on the dance floor.  \\"Be With You\\" is all about the bedroom, and \\"Speechless,\\" though beautifully sung, is another bedroom number.  But I guess I should have figured her CD would be hormone-driven from the front cover.  There were very few songs about real love and commitment. Perhaps \\"Me, Myself And I\\" and \\"Yes\\" best echo the bad boyfriend themes of The Writing's on the Wall, and \\"Baby Boy\\" is reminiscent of \\"Sexy Daddy\\" from Survivor. For me the highlights of the album \\"Me, Myself And I,\\" \\"Yes,\\" \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" with Luther Vandross (a shorter version than what appeared on his CD), and \\"Gift From Virgo.\\"  Overall, this CD is a good, but needs to be honest about its true focus.
B000000ORE|4.0|I was about 14 years old when I heard this album for the first time--and then as now, what blew me away about it was the conviction, and the songwriting.<br />Melody beats bombast every time--refer to Van Halen's early albums for this lesson--and song for song, \\"The Great Radio Controversy\\" is arguably Tesla's best album (others give that title to \\"Psychotic Supper\\").  \\"Hang Tough\\" (not to be confused with NKOTB), \\"Lady Luck\\", \\"Lazy Days, Crazy Nights\\", and \\"Makin Magic\\" all sway from verse/chorus/verse in various tempos but never vary in quality.<br />Besides, the harmony vocals are what set Tesla aside from their contemporaries--see them as a smart Poison with better chops and even better taste in influences.  Check out \\"Love Song\\" (one of the best power ballads of all time), and \\"Paradise\\" (note the G'n'R homage in the 2nd half of the song) for proof.<br />It's aged a little--I have to be honest--but it still holds up.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Ok..So Wilco and Tori Amos and even Filter have put out POST 9-11/ american affairs albums. Now, Madonna too has something to say...Or does she? <BR>I can't help but think of madonna as a 40 year old (or however old she is) Brat. Just another one of the extremely rich celebrities who think they have an exclusive take on politics. <BR>&quot;Nobody knows me&quot; may be one of the best songs on the album...but to me, it is almost as self absorbed and silly as &quot;Lucky&quot; from britney spears. Yeah, yeah...I know what they are trying to say. &quot;I'm rich and fabulous...but i get sad too...boohoo&quot;. I just find a lot of apathy in songs that try to seem intimate or revealing. <BR>&quot;Hollywood&quot; is another song that I can almost stand...but once again, I feel that she is trying to whine about a position of her own choosing. How can any other person in Hollywood be a bigger reptile than madonna? I guess SHE would know...<BR>I find her take on American amusing...I think madonna is as genuine as her british accent.
B000002LBH|5.0|Gotta love that Atlantic difference... some albums come over to North America with a brilliant looking cover and a slight variation in track listings, then they become collector's items, or else (in this case) essential compilations that make the buying of later editions completely unnecessary.<br />Unlike the mind-numbing, track-time warping of the &quot;Best of Smiths volumes 1 and 2&quot;, this is the Smiths at their very best, and in the proper context, also.  If you have this, then &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot;, you don't need much else.  &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; repackages tracks from their early albums, and replaces &quot;The World Won't Listen&quot; as the US release.<br />One of the best British compilations of all time.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Now how do I begin writing a review on an album that means so much to me. Marvin was dead three years before I was born and I had nothing to do with his music until I was 12. My parents bought me a CD player and gave me some money to buy CD's on my 12th birthday. I went to the nearest music shop and all around me there were thousands of CD's but one stood out like a beacon. It was &quot;What's Going On&quot;, still by far the best album I have ever heard, I still have my Mum's original 45 of &quot;Mercy, Mercy Me&quot; and even &quot;Sad Tomorrows&quot; which is the B-side sounds amazing. This was the pinnacle of not only Gaye's career but of music in general. This album liberated the black people and gave them a hope and a voice. Many people refer to Stevie Wonder as the man to revolutionise black music, they are all wrong, had Marvin Gaye not produced this album who knows what black music would sound like today. It is so deep ,it can be listened to in any state of mind and the listener will always feel better after just a few short seconds. To all people who have this album go out and buy &quot;Here, my Dear&quot; which is also superb. Lie back, relax and let this world pass you by while listening to the soulful tones of Marvin. Right on brother!
0393057658|5.0|I'm not much of a baseball fan, but this book is about much more than baseball.  While I hate cliche's, frankly this book is about &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;.  It explores how the Oakland A's have been consistent winners while mainting a low salary.  They have managed to do this by figuring out the characteristics of ideal players who can really help the team win.  It is fascinating to read about how simple some of these stats are, and yet how elusive they were for the rest of the teams.  <br />For the businessman the challenge is clear:  figure out ways to win that the competition has overlooked, and success awaits you.<br />An altogether brilliantly written book, I've already given copies to several people in my company to read.
078322687X|5.0|So ... 'summing you readers know what the heck Ecclessiastes is about ... where in hades am I coming from ?<br />Not wishing to get Biblical on anyone, however, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, like Ecclessiastes, is Pravda that, Generation-to-Generation, the Norm, not the Exception, are viscious, mean-spirited, hurtful, obnoxious &quot;persons&quot; such as that portrayed by Mr. Nelson.<br />In short, THE BREAKFAST CLUB serves as a Superb Reminder that the World really hasn't changed a bit since Creation.  Or my own torments at my own Judd Nelsons' hands.<br />I should particularly reveal to the Reader two aspects in particular to THE BREAKFAST CLUB that take me back in time to a most dreary and depressing &quot;life&quot; among my &quot;peers&quot; - not only did I feel Nothing in Common with Any of its Leads, it must be observed that these most Disparate Personalities are not only Protagonists, but Antagonists to each other.<br />One might also note that there are Two Female Students, Two Male Students, and Two Radically Disparate School &quot;Officials&quot;, one, a powerful hard hind end who desperately wishes to ram his autocratic rule down the throat of yet several MORE &quot;rebellious&quot; &quot;punks&quot;, effectively transforming them into spiteful replicas of God Himself, and a lowly Janitor (you just got to read this Ecclessiastes thing for a complete understanding !) who is a hell of a LOT more understanding AND compassionate re: our teen &quot;offenders&quot; then Almighty Mr. Muckety Muck.<br />In the words of a Woman I very much respect,<br />So it goes.<br />In my own words,<br />So it must go on.
0694003611|5.0|My daughter received 3 copies of Goodnight Moon when she was born.  This was my first clue that Goodnight Moon is a special book.  We now have 3 children (and about 5 copies), they have all loved this book.  I have such fond memories of all of my babies sitting on my lap as I read this book to them, so I just can't recommend Goodnight Moon highly enough.
B00003CWTI|2.0|i understand the movie.  i like the overall message.  but this would have been a much better movie in two hours than it is in three.<br />in short, the direction is of the &quot;why make this scene last two minutes, when it can last five?&quot; variety.  lingering camera shots that serve no apparent purpose.  unlikeable characters, almost across the board, and too many of them.  a laugh-out-loud musical number (yes, really) that's supposed to be deathly serious, about two hours and twenty minutes in.  a rather insulting ending that greatly disappoints non critic-types in the audience, given how great the first ten minutes are.<br />one star for the chapter stops and fast forward options on the DVD version.  one star for how good this movie can be when you fast forward liberally.  total: 2 stars.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce Knowles truly allows the world to see a portion of what she can lay out musically to the world.  There is no doubt that her solo album is the best out of the individual solo albums that each DC member has done so far (unless you are a unnecessary hater).  She can sing, produce, write, arrange, and compose like it's truly second nature.  Every song gives you a taste of what she can do and where she can go musically. It's a collage of her musical essence.<br />\\"Baby Boy\\" is HOTTTTTT!!!!!!! The reggae/R&B bounce and rhythm hits you hard and you can't front and act like you don't want to at least bounce when you listen to it. \\"Yes\\" maybe misleading to many people by thinking that it can be compared to Aaliyah's \\"One In A Million\\", but it's not. It's in the range of Aaliyah's song, but it's like Jupiter to Aaliyah's \\"One In A Million\\".  Anyway, it's a nice song to listen to.  \\"Speechless\\" is a song that I truly lets Beyonce be emotionally free vocally and allows here to feel to moment of making love.  <br />The album is a great R&B set.  It combines a great set of musicians behind and along with Beyonce's musicianship (including Jay-Z co-writing on 5 songs including \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"That's How I Like It\\") and Beyonce's versatile soprano-range vocals.  <br />Should you buy the album? YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
0385504209|5.0|The first quesiton I asked myself on finishing this book was: how did I miss Angels &amp; Demons, Dan Brown's first book featuring Robert Langdon, the protagonist of The Da Vinci Code?  I enjoyed this novel so much--more than I expected to--that I was disappointed that I didn't have all the background.<br />Seriously, what's not to like about this book?--a smart and engaging main character surrounded by a cast of equally engaging friends and enemies; secret societies and the secret lives of historical figures like Newton and Victor Hugo; a plot pushed forward by decipherable clues as simple as anagrams and as complex as the hidden meaning of Da Vinci art; the meaning of religious &quot;artifacts&quot; like the Holy Grail; the meaning of religion itself.  It all makes for an irresistible combination.  And Brown, though not perhaps the most adept prose stylist, does a good job of getting us through the twists and turns in an enjoyable fashion.<br />Of course, comfortable in my catholicism, I enjoy speculative novels like this.  I can wonder about the truth of religion without feeling my religion or myself is being attacked.  Plus, my reading has made me familiar already with many of the arguments Brown makes.  But if you are the type of person who is uncomfortable with writing that brings into question some of the basic tenets of Christianity, stay away from this novel.  You will not enjoy it.  But if you want a thrilling ride that also will make you stop and think about some things you thought you knew, this is a book to be read.
B000024D4R|5.0|This album stands on its own as the best guitar rocking release that Floyd ever did.  Yes the lyrics are awesome, the rythyms are soulful and the floydisms are there, but the importance I get out of it is that Gilmour steps out and lets loose on this mother. All Floyd is worthy of owning (even Final Cut). Each has its own theme.  This one is about in your face guitar. A must have for every guitar enthusiast.
1573225517|5.0|This is the first Nick Hornby book I read and since then I read all of his work. He manages to write each book with a unique writing style and this is no different. The story is about a small record store owner and his coming to grips with love. The book is full of his top 5 lists from top five songs to the top 5 breakups. All which help play an important role and help develop the character. This is a truly wonderful book and comes highly recomended from along with his other works.
B00000258J|5.0|Here is another classic blues CD that everyone must have.  A top 5 in all blues recordings.  Great versions of tunes, awesome band and Muddy in his prime.  You can hear the fun they are having at the end of Mannish Boy.  When ever a musician can be relaxed and just let it go, thats when the magic happens.  And this gem is full of magic! Essential Recording, now go get it!
B000002IZ4|5.0|With this CD, the band matures.  Styles among cuts vary more than on Core.  There is some inconsistency -- not all cuts are memorable -- but the several that are stick clearly in the mind and redefined popular music.  Variance in tempo and volume showcase the band's talent which is considerable.  Lyrics in a couple of cases are profound and still ring in my ears, years after first owning this CD.  The band's serious downhill run began after this CD, but get this one to round out your collection of the best from the Grunge era.
B000002U82|5.0|Bottom line, Perhaps the best thing ever to hit vinyl, ever! If you don't have it, what are you waiting for. In the Top 5 on ever &quot;best of&quot; list I have ever seen.  Enjoy!
B00005RYLE|5.0|Ok.  This dvd is WELL WORTH THE MONEY!  ... also, the DVD box is made of latex so if ur allergic DONT BUY.  THis also cause a REAL HUMAN FLESH feel.  and an undead stench.  LOL.
B000002NJS|5.0|I have listened to most of Madonna's music from the 80's to the 00's, and her 1998 album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is my absolute favourite. She has matured so much since the &quot;material girl&quot; days of the late 80's. Some might say this album was her inauguration into the world of electronica. Although it is true, some of the songs do have fast beats with futuristic sounds, many are just plain Madonna pop (&quot;swim&quot;, &quot;nothing really matters&quot;, etc.). It is an eclectic mix of traditional pop, modern electronica, and hindu mysticism. But dont let that scare you, it makes for a perfect combination that is distinctly madonna. A must buy!!<br />my favs:<BR>every single one. even shanti/ashtangi!
0688163173|3.0|I was at first captivated by the characterization of the main character, Teddy, his losses and his longings.  The setting, an island in Boston Harbor also caught my attention as I have worked on the islands when in college.  The plot moved fast with all of the makings of a thriller, mad doctor, killer, island, storm, survival, bad guys, etc.  The last quarter of the book was a let down...its not just that the ending was disappointing, the pace and the writing seemed to run out of steam.  It almost seemed as though LeHane became bored with the ending and lost his magic, his flair.  Without giving away the plot and/or ending, there were many ways to add intrigue to the finish of this book without changing the conclusion.  The last few chapters were painful to read through ad the ending became inevitable instead of a mystery and the action dropped way down.  Not his best, but I am still a fan.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|What did you expect? This movie is a classic.
B000022TSW|5.0|This movie is very funny. who cares what they say about god and jesus. its just a movie. sure they say the &quot;f&quot; word alot but lighten up. let these genius do what they want. i hate how all those religous people judge others. well isn't that a sin. so since you judge....i'll save you a seat on my way down to hell and all of you can sit by me cuz this movie is the best of 99'. i take my hat off to matt sone and trey parker. great movie
0805062971|5.0|I had already seen the movie and year or so ago, and I finally got around to reading it. People say how good the movie is- well, this is better. It is a quick reader, and is loaded with great lines!
B00008X5J1|3.0|GANGS OF NEW YORK has been hailed as a magnificent recreation of a pre-Civil War New York torn by racial and ethnic prejudice.  Others label it in the same words but without the qualifier 'magnificent.'  The truth is probably somewhere in between.  Director Martin Scorsese clearly wanted GANGS OF NEW YORK to fit in with his frequent mythological interpretations of purely American character and history.  Scorsese succeeds in capturing the overblown essence that was surely the chaotic mess of the Boss Tweed era.  However dangerous New York might seem today, the proliferation of gangs and crooked cops make the waterfront section of the Five Points seem as hostile as Beirut ever was.  In nearly every scene, Scorcese places muggers, burning buildings, hookers, pickpockets, and urban warfare.  <br />The unifying theme that Scorcese sought was that of revenge, most often for the murder of a family member.  There are no less than three separate examples of revenge sought as a reason to wreak further havoc.  The primary seeker is, of course, Amsterdam Vallon, hugely miscast by Leonardo DiCaprio.  In nearly every scene that DiCaprio is in, he shows no more emotion than the ubiquitous picture of his late father shows.  The only exception is the fistfight between him and one of Bill the Butcher's lackeys.  For a child who saw his father killed in street warfare, DiCaprio as an adult is remarkably unconcerned.  He is meant to be the dramatic center, but he is so lacking in the gravitas required of an action hero, that the audience by default looks elsewhere.  This dramatic vacuum is soon filled by Daniel-Day Lewis, who plays Bill 'the Butcher' Cutter, in one of the most memorable screen villain performances ever.  Lewis steals the show in much the same way that James Earl Jones did as Darth Vader in STAR WARS.  Lewis struts, rhapsodizes, bullies, and tosses knives as he embodies the very essence of a thug who knows how to build and to maintain a criminal empire.  He even engagesthe audience's sympathy as he shows himself to be a 'butcher' more in the job sense than in the psychological one.  He kills people, true enough, but he does so with his own hands.  His cohort-in-crime, Boss Tweed kills far more in allowing New York to be a cesspool that gobbles up thousands of disembarking Irish on a daily basis. Further, Bill as the Butcher, kills Amsterdam Vallon's father in fair and open combat and even praises his fallen foe as a worthy opponent whose corpse ought not be defiled.  Cameron Diaz as Jenny the pickpocket has little to do but first attract Amsterdam's attentions then heal his physical wounds.  <br />The lasting impression of GANGS OF NEW YORK is how Scorcese depicts the anarchy that was New York during the anti-draft riots of the Civil War.  The swirling gangs with colorful names like the Plug-Uglies, the Dead Rabbits, and the Bowery Boys are seen ultimately as the collective consciousness of a city that was being inundated by immigrants who themselves were immigrants only one generation past but now call themselves 'nativists.' Given the length of the film (167 minutes) it would have been difficult for any director to keep the audience focused on the titular hero.  But in this case, Scorsese unwittingly proved once again that a charismatic villain can easily overshadow a bland hero to such an extent that the audience identifies more with this villain than either with the hero or the plot.  Still, the resounding spectacle makes GANGS OF NEW YORK required viewing.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love this movie. Boo is so cute and each character's personality is just fun. The whole time is one big adventure!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Michael Mann's direction of the movie is all over the place.  The story doesn't give the whole story.  What about his beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky?  What was his motivation for joining the Nation of Islam?  Who are these women in Ali's life?  Don't get me wrong.  The performances were the best thing in this movie.  Preferrably from Will Smith, Jon Voight and Jamie Foxx.  You should be more inclinded to see the movie \\"The Greatest\\" which shows Muhammad Ali as himself.  And even though the champis stiff as an actor, the story is better represented.
B0000028M7|5.0|What in...why is this ONLY 4.7 stars out of 5? Is it b/c some stupid person was disappointed? This is one of THE Cds where Layne's voice is not effected by the drugs. A lot of songs here are just...WOW I give this track a definite 13/10
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is  an insightful and hilarious book. I first read it in high high school and loved it and thought I'd take a second look. It still holds up and is still incredibly funny. It speaks of the insanity of war but really comments on the absurdness of life. <br />Heller has created a number of unforgetable characters that continue live on well after putting the book down. The humor in the book and the overall tone of not only questioning authority but ridiculing it make it a joy to read and reread.
B000059T1G|5.0|Kind of a forgotten Traffic record, but it won't be forgotten long once you've heard &quot;Feeling Good&quot;. An incredible, magical piece of music. (Withering Tree is also great).<BR>Buy this CD.
B000002NG7|4.0|This is probably the weakest of the Faith No More albums which feature patton on vocals. This does not,however, make it a bad record. Topping their 1992 'Angel Dust' opus was never going to be easy, and they seemed to regress slightly with 1994's 'King for a Day..', which had many great tracks but lacked the consistency and effortless experimentation that 'Angel Dust' was absolutely crammed full with. 'Album of the Year' is a fine album, but flawed, with the inter band tension very evident in places, seemingly a fixture of bands on the verge of breakup. The strongest thing about this record is the presence of some wonderful singles: 'Ashes to Ashes'is the most commercially viable and melodic ('Easy' notwithstanding) tune since the days of 'The Real Thing'. Both 'Last cup of sorrow' and 'Stripsearch' are examples of that smooth and harmonious keyboard edged rock that only FNM can pull off so well. 'Stripsearch' I might add, is like nothing the band have ever attempted before: haunting and eerie, light and dark, gentle and fiery. The album is also pleasingly diverse and in places plain odd: 'Collision' and 'Naked in front of the computer' are two of the heaviest and fastest numbers the band produced, while 'Mouth to Mouth' and 'Got that feeling' display Patton's at times bizzare influence on the bands sound. 'Pristina' is my standout track: it seems to manage to be overpoweringly dark and uplifting at the same time.<br />Theres enough great music on here to merit 4 stars easily, but I still feel Faith No More were capable of so much more, even in the twilight stages of their career. Fans will of course want to pick this up instantly, but newcomers are recommended to go via 'The Real Thing' and then 'Angel Dust' instead.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I am a HUGE X-Men fan, so when i went to watch this, I had great expectations...and all of them were met...except that not all my favorite characters were involved (but what else are sequels for).  The way it ended was great.  It told me that there is going to be an X3: (Pheonix Rises).  When I left the theatre i was soooo excited for the third x-men movie that i almost got into a car accident.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!
B000002J09|5.0|As the title states, there might not be any bigger, monstrous album than Led Zeppelin IV.  Every song is now a bona fide classic played on radio stations everywhere.  Led Zeppelin constructed an album highlighting their perfection of early heavy metal (Black Dog), folk (Going To California), Electrified Blues (When The Levee Breaks), Hard Rock (Rock and Roll), and one of the greatest rock songs ever (Stairway to Heaven).  Many people discount this album because of Stairway as it is overplayed.  If you look at the album as a whole, it flows rather well and is not a greatest hits collection as it very well could be.  Zeppelin realized all their talents here and it is evident on such blistering tracks as Black Dog and When The Levee Breaks (the two standout tracks here).  The excellent call and response between Page and Plant is unmatched and the absolute power of When The Levee Breaks shows the band firing on all cylinders.  Why this album is so huge is Stairway to Heaven.  No other Led Zeppelin song quite encompasses their mystery, technical excellence, and amazing chops.  It starts off as a folk song but it quietly broods into a heavy metal guitar feast at the end of the 8 minute epic.  Deserving of all the praise it gets, it is the defining moment of Led Zeppelin.  As a result, I think the album is overlooked as an incredible achievment in favor of other Zep albums.  It seems as though the band worked out all of its kinks in the first three albums and finally composed an album of ALL stellar tracks and no filler.  The production is exquisite and highlights Bonham's ferocious drumming and Page's stunning guitar work be it acoustic or the powerful electric.  This album changed hard rock music forever giving all bands a template to work off of.  This album almost created the Heavy Metal genre.  It also contains beautiful acoustic work and some psychedelia with Misty Mountain Hop.  A must for any music collection as it is truly the one Led Zeppelin album that shows thebest rock band at their zenith in creativity, production, and song craft.
B00004XMS0|5.0|BATMAN (1989)***** The best of the four.Batman must save Gotham from the evil Joker.This movie delivers action,comedy, and romance. What else could you ask for?! This movie was the movie of the 80's and won an Academy Award. You will love it I guarantee.<br /> BATMAN RETURNS (1992)***** Tim Burton and Michael Keaton has done it again. This time Batman must save Gotham City from the evil Penguin and the mysterious Catwoman. This movie was awesome! You will love I guarantee.<br /> BATMAN FOREVER (1995)***** This one is my favorite of the four. This time it is directed by Joel Shcumacher,Batman is played by Val Kilmer, and Robin makes his first appearance. This time Batman nad Robin must save Gotham City from Two-Face and The Riddler. This movie was awesome! You will love it I guarantee.<br /> BATMAN AND ROBIN (1997)****. This movie was not good like the other three, but it is still entertaining. Joel Shcumacher did it again. This time Batman is played by George Clooney, and Batgirl makes her first appearance. Now the villans are Mr. Freeze, and Poisen Ivy. The reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5, is because it did not have good villains. But the good thing about this film is that it has the best special effects, and action sequences of the four. You might like it.<br />   I recommend the first three and the fourth only if you absolutly love the first three.
6305265488|4.0|Ever After is truly an escape. It leaves you with the same warm, happy feeling as a fairy tale, but you feel less ashamed of yourself for enjoying it.<br />Drew Barrymore's character, Danielle, however seems to be drawing upon that same smart, bookish girl that is automatically a heroine. She is kind to the servants, misses her parents and loves to read. These traits are quite deliberately placed into scenes, instead of being woven in subtly. Drew Barrymore, though, does an excellent job with creating a bit of depth to her otherwise cliche character. At times, especially when she must say something particularly noble, Barrymore's delivery feels a bit forced, but overall it is almost unnoticable.<br />Melanie Lynskey gives more depth to her character in the few minutes she is on the screen, than some do in the entire movie. As the &quot;good stepsister&quot;, she is not completely good. She does not posess the malevolence that her sister and mother posess, but she is not brave enough to confront them. She takes their abuse silently. She mentally cheers for Danielle, but when Danielle's chores are given to her, one can see the immediate unhappiness on her face.<br />The movie has a wonderful supporting cast, and the scenes are well-crafted and unique. The sets include some beautiful gardens and castles, and the movie is, for the most part, quite pleasing to the eye.
0380789019|4.0|Neverwhere is the kind of novel you read purely for fun.  It's all story, every last bit of it intriguing and likeable.  It walks an amazingly fine line between being completely ludicrous and surprisingly poignant and scary.  Its characters are all colorful and Gaiman's deft hand with mythology and literature again impresses.  Every step of Richard Mayhew's journey into the underground labrynth of London is more fantastical than the step before it, and some of the ways in which Gaiman skirts traditional storytelling conventions are ingenious.  Highly recommended.  Four and a half stars, really.
0345448898|3.0|This man is one of the best writers  I have read in years.  His writing is almost as good as C.S. Lewis, and better than Tolkiens'.  The first two books are pretty good--- dialogue, plot, good, evil, magic---- tailored to the literate reader. The third book kind of lost me, though.  I don't particularly mind his anti-Catholicism; I suspect he was once a Catholic himself, or is related to a Catholic. Ex-Catholics are often like ex-smokers. I can forgive that.  But he needn't have devoted the  entire third book to the refutation of  Christianity.  What seems to be a personal mission on his part  gets in the way of the story.<br />And what kind of an attack on Christianity neglects to mention even once in three volumes the name or message or actions of its founder?
0380789035|5.0|American Gods is a seminal novel.  It's importance to me as a reader and a writer is indescribable; reading it, I realized that everything in fiction hasn't been done, that even while exploring explored themes new things can be uncovered.  It's a (literally) magical trip through America, an unforgettable, funny, touching novel that weighs much more than its volume would indicate.<br />I never read novels twice; I feel that it's a waste of time I could be using to read a new novel, to create the feeling of reading a new great work rather than rehash a feeling I've already had.  I will read American Gods several times more, I think.  It's that good.  Gaiman's other work is good as well, but this is THAT good, the kind of good you only find in brief snippets.  Except this one's a few hundred pages worth.
0142004235|5.0|It was three years ago when I picked up this book for a way to pass the cold winter days in Virginia. Having come from a dysfunctional family, and fearing that I would be doomed to repeat the past of my family and after fearing that my mother would someday awaken within me, this book changed my life and my perspective on life and how I see it. It is the summation of many philoshical viewpoints on God and self-determination all rolled into one story. The story does take a while to pick up, but I am glad that I stuck with it. Anyone who sticks through it and allows Steinbeck to flesh out the meaning of his novel will be pleased with the end-result. It is a great lesson/message for anyone who has had difficult people in their families (who hasn't?).
B00009V7RF|3.0|The problem with this album is that it's nothing special.  It quite frankly, does not sound remotely like the Peas of old, rather more recent Naughty By Nature.  New member Fergie's voice is an acquired taste, and only really works when she either takes the spotlight (&quot;Fly Away&quot;) or the back seat (the snippets on &quot;Shut Up&quot;) - middle ground just seems awkward (tracks like &quot;The Boogie That B&quot; make you wonder how Will and the boys gave her full-member status).  If you love BEP's older stuff, this might be a little hard to get into; on the other hand, if this is your first introduction to the group, having heard the Justin collaboration, you shouldn't have any trouble feeling this album.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Who cares if the film follows the book to the letter!!<BR>Both Lord of the Rings' Movies have taken the film industry into another era. I love both the movies and could watch them over and over.  Could it be that these are arguably the best movies ever made??  I know that I have to wait for the third installment, I dont want to!!  But it will be worth the wait.  Fantastic special effects, great acting and incredible scenery.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is the type of movie that defies description, not only because of the melange of several different genres, but because of the feeling it leaves you once the end credits roll.  I saw this movie for the first time this past year at University and at the end of the movie I just sat there shaking my head, my jaw dropped to the floor.  I proceeded to rave about the film to my dorm-mates, and they would always ask me &quot;What's it about?&quot;  My reply would always be &quot;I can't tell you.  Not because I don't want to give anything away, but because it is impossible to describe.&quot;  Then after they watched it I would ask them what they thought, and the number one response was a look of amazement followed by &quot;You're right, I can't describe what I just saw.&quot;  I should follow that up by saying every single person who I told to watch the movie loved it and raved about it to their friends, who in turn fell in love with the adventures of Donnie.<BR>The cast is superb, the script is perfect, the score is beautifully haunting, and Richard Kelly displays an enormous talent in directing his first major film.  There are numerous moments where you just can't believe how good, or how touching, or how poignant, or how mysterious, or how perfect a scene is.  I can't physically tell you what happens plotwise, but I can tell you that you will be blown away as I was.<BR>The DVD is very high quality for the price with very good picture quality, excellent sound, and great menus.  It is packed with special features, some are wonderful (the Mad World music video and the deleted scenes with director commentary,) some are unnecessary (a picture of the soundtrack.)  The commentaries for the feature are an excellent complement to the film.  One has director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhall providing wonderful insights, and the other has at least 7 cast and crew members (Kelly again, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Jena Malone, and several others) reminiscing in glowing terms on their experience.  The camaraderie that you feel between them is wonderful, and the movie is seen as a labor of love for each person.<BR>This movie makes a wonderful addition to anyone's collection.  I have yet to convince someone to watch it and have them tell me they thought it was anything less than amazing.  You will feel the same way, no matter what your tastes.
0345413377|3.0|ive read quite a few other reviews of this book and i was fairly suprised at the differences in reviews. Some people seem to praise Philip Pullman as a God and i can just about see why they would. However i read a few reviews which disturbed me slightly. I think it is right to say that the Christian faith gets attacked in the books and i feel for people with a strong christian faith but some people can take it a bit too seriously. I read one review where someone said Philip Pullman was aiding satan in his battle against God and wants to go to Hell. People have also said that The His Dark Materials trilogy is evil (some of these will be the same people who burnt Harry Potter books for ,as far as i can see, unknown reasons.) Now i can see why people would see these books as anti-christian propoganda but i also think the christian faith has thrown around some pretty awful propoganda around the last few years. I feel that the Christian faith does force its views down your throat a bit too excessively (a picture comes to my mind of a red faced priest yelling at 7 year olds about how they will burn for all eternity if they do not confess their sins.)<BR>Anyway as far as the book goes i thought it had some very powerful descriptive and emotional writing (i almost cried at one point much to my anger as id never cry at anything so corny) <BR>but also had some blaitant attacks on the christian faith and also had a very dissapointingly weak battle. I was expecting a huge fight but all i got was a few beings made of light being set on fire an angel so powerful and feared which annoyingly could be destroyed by two human beings and some ghosts fighting other ghost type beings and less heavy weapony than i could find in my own kitchen.<br />However the thing that annoyed me most were the extremely unrealistic coincidences. How the hell do 4 different people on 3 different journies end up in the same world out of 1,000,000s of different worlds?<BR>Oh and i never really understood where that bit about Lyra being tempted came in and wasnt Mary supposed to tempt her (she was told to play the serpent, which if im not mistaken was the creature which was supposed to tempt Adam and Eve/ Will and Lyra, but that part of the story never came about.<br />After the book i felt moved by the nice but corny ending but after a while i became annoyed.<br />In short i dont know what the books were about at all and i am left deeply disturbed as most books give you some sort of closure. it was as if the books didnt follow on at all!<br />Anyway read the trilogy as its some of the most powerful writing youll have the chance to read but dont be suprised if your left shouting \\"WHAT ... WAS THAT!!\\" at the end of the trilogy.
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut puts the &quot;f&quot; in &quot;funny&quot;. Some parents may not agree, for the scene where Kenny tries to get into heaven is far from appropriate. Terrance and Philip's hit single isn't either, but for people that are mature enough to understand the simplicity, it's two hours of rolling on the floor laughing til you die! The musical numbers pull it all together with rude words and sometimes surprising references (look closely at the faces in hell) but that's what makes this movie great! So if you're even allowed to see it, get ready to laugh, because that's all you'll be doing while you watch this movie! Vive la resistance!
B00005JM09|4.0|Given that James Cameron wasn't involved in the making of this film and that \\"The Terminator\\" is his baby, his creation, one would've expected his involvement.  Take that and the fact that \\"T2 Judgment Day\\" seemed to put an end to Skynet and the horrible future created for this outstanding series and one might've expected the plot to be thin but that simply isn't the case.  This film does an outstanding job of extending the \\"Terminator\\" mythos and series as a whole!<br />The premise:<br />As we all learned in \\"T2 Judgment Day,\\" seemingly all possibilities for Skynet to come into existence and launch its war against humanity are supposedly eliminated by that films Terminator, and Sarah and John Connor.  That isn't the case though as it seems that Skynet is an inescapable factor, leading to its taking control of every computer on the planet and waging its war against humanity.  Hence, we have the \\"purpose\\" for this film and the purpose for the Terminatrix to be sent back in order to once again chase down John Connor who is now in his early twenties.  Now we also have the purpose for Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator to make his trip through time to protect John Connor and others...  What follows is a well done film that is extreme in the action sequences and a fairly well laid out plot.  The Terminatrix is definitely a thrilling villain against Arnold's Terminator.<br />I'd say that my first impression of the film after this first viewing is that yes, it's a good film to go to the theater to watch and yes, even though one might think they couldn't extend the story after T2, it does.  In the final analysis though, when one compares the depth of the stories told in the first two films, one can definitely see that the series creator, James Cameron, either wasn't involved at all or at the least he wasn't involved much!  Which is pretty much why I can only give this film four stars!<br />Would I recommend that you go see this film, yes it is worth it!  Would I buy the DVDwhen it's released, yes!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />Hey kido's this is a theatrical release, the only special features that you get to enjoy on this film at this point is the kid fidgeting and yammering away in the seat next to you, the infant wailing away several seats down from but so loud they seem to be right next to you and oh yeah, the couple three seats down from you that seem to think that the cell phone their yakking on is more important than the movie they paid to see.  Enjoy!
B00005JM09|5.0|This movie is incredible. No other movie this year could even be compared to this film. The special effects and the story are unbelievable. The acting by Arnold and Nick Stahl(who does a great job as John Connor) is wonderful. I recommend this for Terminator fans everywhere, and even if you aren't a fan of the series, you will totally dig this movie.
B00005JM09|5.0|This movie depicts the sequence of events leading to the inevitable judgment day where Skynet becomes self aware and directs attacks against humankind. John Conner, a homeless drifter, does all he can to remain anonymous. Even though he and his late mother did all they could to prevent judgment day, John still is not absolutely sure that he won't be a target for the futuristic robots.  Injured after a motorcycle accident, he breaks into an animal clinic to steal drugs to try to treat himself. At the same time his former high school friend, a vet (and future wife) gets an emergency call to report to the same clinic. She is the daughter of the Air Force Officer in charge of structuring and implementing Skynet. The latest and baddest, female type, terminator comes back from the future to destroy John Connor. She has a hit list of John's friends including the vet. She shows up at the clinic at the same time. She almost succeeds in killing the future Mrs. Connor but thankfully Arnold turns up just in the nick of time. <br />I love this movie. The plot is similar to T2. It is packed with action, shooting, and destruction.  This time around, the terminator takes orders only from the future second in command: Mrs. Conner.  She, at first is an unwilling participant who gives 100+% effort once she comes to realize what's really going on. Some time in the future, John Conner gets killed by the terminator. A seed has been planted for another sequel just so we can find out how that came to be.<br />I must add that Arnold Schwarzenegger is remarkably fit. He is unbelievably buff and toned. The effect of the three-hour-a-day workouts he did shows and displays well on screen. I, as a woman, am grateful to have some eye candy to look at (even if he's an older man). Thanks Arnold!!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's The Davinci Code is one of the finest books I've read in a while. Completely enthralling, I found it impossible to put the book down. Twists and turns a plenty are found in this historical treasure hunt. Completely turned my opinion of the Bible and the Catholic Church upside down. A fascinating read that anyone would enjoy. A virtual must read.
B00007AJF8|4.0|This is an amusing movie. It spends a lot of time just showing us how bizarre the world of these characters are and by its end, it hasn't given us many new ideas or followed through on everything nicely. How Craig could manipulate J.Malkovich because of his career is kind of a MacGuffin, really. We never get too attached to the characters because they are all too often, there for a joke or cartoon-ish and not fleshed out too well. For this movie to be ideal, it would have to have more genuine characters and emotions depicted. It's dreamlike in the perfect way however, you just have to like it for what it is.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Although Norah Jones is a step ahead of the pack, the cardinal rule of music is simple and finite: timing is everything. Similar to the release of Jewel's &quot;Pieces of You&quot; hot on the heels of the grunge movement, the release of Jones's album coincided with a period of musical confusion: the removal of teen pop. In a period when artists are suddenly trying to shake off their tween images, Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air: she has no such baggage.<br />Blending old and newer, more contemporary elements of jazz, Norah Jones has managed to create a solid, enjoyable album. Her cover of Hank William's &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; burns with her hickory smoked, rich voice; and her own material, especially the entrancing, romantic &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; is some of the best stuff in ages. The production is light and calm in an age of overproduction, but the mood of the album does goes slightly south. Opting for a slow-burning mood to compliment her voice, Jones actually does, at times, more harm then good, as some of the tracks (especially the anemic &quot;Painter Song&quot;) begin to blend together in sort of a gray, montonous line. It would have done Jones some good to open the door and let some light in as the CD comes to a close. Although some slight relief does come along as the mood goes stale (&quot;One Flight Down&quot; and &quot;Lonestar&quot; are both strong songs caught in the dim swirl of the final quarter), the majority of the second half could do with some extra flair.<br />Norah Jones coasts through the CD, though, an accomplished vocalist. Her beautiful voice is sure to bring jazz to a new generation. If Jones were to implement different production ideas in her next work, it is very possible that she could be the next Billie Holiday. Sleepiness aside, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is a nice, different listen, sure to be a classic for years to come.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Some person wrote a review stipulating the greatness of Sparta over the Mars Volta.  Please disregard this person who must Also think Sugar Ray is a Genius.  This album definately requires repeat listenings, and grows with color and depth with each song.  The Mars Volta came out with the two most talented mebers of ATDI.  They will also gain more respect from everyone than Sparta for venturing outside of the bluprint ATDI sound that Sparta Sparta seems so bent on sticking on.  This is something new, energetic, and exciting. An amalgamation of different genres with and avant-garde prog rock basis that will blow your mind away.  Also attempt to get acess to the lyrics.  altough sometimes vague,  you will be able to see a story developing using quite poetic prose.  Please give them a listen to.  I would give them a 10 if this thing went up that far.  P.S. the Mars Volta Live show is by far the best i have ever seen.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Amadeus is by far the best movie ever made. Even if you are not very fond of classical music, this is a spectacular movie with wonderful screenplay. <br />  This my favorite move and I think that all should watch it even though it's not very accurate, historically that is. It's not even all about music; it's really about Antonio Salieri and his jealousy of Mozart being so gifted with music.
0380789019|4.0|Neverwhere was the first book i'd read by neil gaiman, long before i'd read any of the Sandman work he's done.  And i loved the book more then i had anything i'd veiwed before.  And still do.  The ability to transform the world and places in that world into something obviously appropriate for those who wished to see it as that.<br />Neverwhere takes you deep underground and into worlds that you would possibbly never even consider exsisting with charecters that capture your intrest.
B000000W6F|5.0|Technically the 3rd Pumpkins album I aquired, I often find myself listening to it more often than all the others.  Honestly Im just another long time corganite, however this music is very appealing in a more general way to a more general audience.  Unlike essentially all the other Pumpkins albums this one tends more to focus on a more raw(though artful and clever)rock sound.  The only real exception to the rock out stuff are the last track and the hidden track, which are more progressive and interesting from a mellow standpoint.  Highly recommendable to Pumpkins fans and rock fans of all ages.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I think that this movie was very good.  As another reviewer said it's not the book, but what everyone needs to remember is that if it was the book word for word, scene for scene it would be much longer (though I don't think I would mind a longer movie),  most people think that they are too long even now.  I would have loved it if the producers had felt that they could be 100% true to the book,  but every movie has a budget, and they couldn't afford to take a risk on these three since they had no clue as to how popular the movies would be.
B00004SA86|4.0|Rafael Kubelik's interpretations of the Mahler symphonies with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks from the later sixties and early seventies are here collected in a fine box which is a real bargain. Some of the interpretations are among the finest available, e.g. symphonies nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. The orchestra was probably in its top form under Kubelik's baton, giving its very best, and the soloists are usually first rate.<br /><br />In general, Kubelik's Mahler is clearly less sentimental and or broad than, for instance, Bernstein's or Abbado's. He presents Mahler's complex works without mannerism but with enthusiasm. This makes the music in each sound very crisp and straightforward, as if it were played for the first time. (This might annoy people that want to have their Mahler served with syrup.) But Kubelik has also a consistent grasp of Mahler's oeuvre as a whole, providing a very clear picture of the nine symphonies including the first movement of the unfinished tenth.<br /><br />Even though the sound picture given these DG recordings is quite close and less spacious, the general HiFi quality is more than satisfactory.<br /><br />In short, I think Kubelik's Mahler must be regarded as the first choice if you want a classic boxed set with these symphonies presented by a single conductor.

B00005JLXE|3.0|An awful lot of people spit blood. Even the hero wrenches a bloody loose tooth from his mouth after one bout of fisticuffs. Daredevil is an orthodontist's dream.<br /><br />But for fans of the comic book, Daredevil is more of a nightmare. Conceived initially as an adult flick, the R rating was trimmed to PG-13 before hitting theaters -- but still, the movie that remains is darker and more brutal than I expected from the optimistic Marvel hero.<br /><br />As is expected whenever Hollywood borrows a page from the comics, Daredevil is very different than his four-color counterpart. Filmmakers got the hypersenses right, but they also gave the hero the inexplicable agility, strength and acrobatic tendencies of last year's superhero blockbuster, Spider-Man. And, unlike the comic-book Daredevil, this one has fewer compunctions when it comes to killing bad guys. His moral code is shaky, his outlook cheerless. Director Mark Steven Johnson's take on Daredevil is meaner and moodier than Tim Burton's Batman.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, Rambles.NET editor
B0000028M7|5.0|How can such a beautiful album like this only get 4.7 stars? I mean, Layne's vocals literally numb my mind at some times. For example, when he's going into the chorus, &quot;Did she call my name?&quot;, its very intense, in fact, listen to it yourself. Outstanding tracks on the album (their all good, but these ones are better than the others), Down in a Hole, Rain when I Die, Dam That River, Them Bones, Rooster, Sickman, Would, waitup, actually i'll end up naming all the songs as the &quot;better tracks&quot; thats how good it is, buy it, i highly doubt you will regret it.
0316666343|2.0|The author did a fine job with similes and strong verbs.  I enjoyed her writing style.  However, after 53 pages I got bored with the story and gave up.  The setup was fairly interesting, but neither the characters nor the story hooked my emotions.  The fantasy about Susie's heaven was dull fluff. I can't believe this was the top fiction seller of 2002.  Was this an Oprah recommendation?
B000002UUX|5.0|someone before posted this as a title, &quot;MetallicA wishes they could be this good!&quot;. Highly agreed. This album deserves the respect that &quot;ride the lightning&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; got, Marty Friedman far outdoes Kirk Hammet, Just listen to &quot;Hanger 18&quot;. And personally, i don't know why people in past reviews complained about Mustaine's vocals, his vocals are awesome!
B000002KCI|5.0|After dealing with the loss of Danny Whitten and Bruce Berry, touring with the crazed &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; tour, and a failed marriage Young regrouped (literally) with a reformed Crazy Horse and created &quot;Zuma.&quot;  This record contains some of Young's greatest rock and roll.  &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; &quot;Barstool Blues,&quot; &quot;Cortez the Killer,&quot; &quot;Don't Cry No Tears&quot; and &quot;Looking for a Lover&quot; are classic Young.  The whole record is!  <br />In true Crazy Horse style Frank &quot;Poncho&quot; Sampedro could barely play his guitar, but Young was able to mold Sampedro, Molina and Talbet into its former greatness when Whitten was still alive and able to play.<br />The question is not &quot;Should I own this cd?&quot; The question is &quot;How many should I own?&quot; The answer is, 1)car, 2)house/apartment, 3)work, 4)girl/boyfriend's apartment and 5)a spare just to be safe.  Five.  Yes five should do.
B00004TRD8|5.0|T2 is an excellent film...enough said. It still holds up 12 years later. The special effects still look realistic as ever and the movie looks as if it just came out.In '91 T2 looked absolutley amazing and in '03 it still does. T3 even pales in comparison. T2 is of course better than the first Terminator and definatley better than the dissappointing T3. Theres six hours of extras on the DVD and its all you'll ever need.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce' has proven that she can make you dance, cry, scream and just about do anything. I have been a fan of b's since the original &quot;No, No, No&quot; came out and I have followed her career and grown with her. This new album shows true soulful singing that is going out of style. B's vocal range is incredible and she proves so much more &quot;woman-like&quot; in this new cd. The sky is the limit for her and if you want a cd that you can party too, work out too, dance too, clean the house too or have an initimate night with your boy or girl, this is the album for you. Go Ms. B.!
B000075BFK|4.0|2pac's newest double album is great. I know there are plenty of remixed tracks and new beats that just don't match Pac's style but as long as they were catchy I didn't care.The best tracks include Still Ballin', Late Night, Whatcha Gonna Do, When We Ride On Our Enemies, Thugz Mansion,and They Don't Give A ****. Disc 1 is the best and Disc two is decent.There are some tracks on here I disliked but other than that Better Dayz holds up pretty good.My next question is this: \\"Will Pac STILL have dozens more of unrelesed tracks so another double album will be released?...\\"

B00005JM09|5.0|I have to admit that I was somewhat leery going into this movie seeing as how James Cameron was not involved with the project. Maybe that wasn't such a bad thing after all. I've always been impressed with how T2 was such a huge success. One of the few movie sequels out there that in many people's opinion surpassed its predecessor. I have to say though that this one may even surpass Terminator 2 in its entertainment value. In my opinion, this movie is better than the first two. It has a better plot, better acting (you can't honestly say that T2's John Connor was decent acting), better action, better FX; you name it, it's bigger and better. The action sequences were phenomenal, namely the scene with the crane and the bathroom brawl between Schwarzenegger and T-X. The plot was very well established and left nothing to be desired. The idea of armageddon is a frightening yet fascinating concept and while the idea of the movie may be far-fetched, the Terminator series was obviously never meant to be believable. The movie was excellent at blending various emotions to a perfect degree of balance: humor, despair, love; nothing was overdone. There was no excessive emphasis on the love story, as has ruined so many movies that were intended to be action films, and the comedy relief was placed at opportune points to relay the awkwardness of human interaction with a machine, perfectly in balance with the rest of the movie so as not to get in the way of the more important parts. And the ending was a perfect twist to an excellent story (I would've have felt somewhat disappointed if they had succeeded at stopping Judgment Day). It leaves one wondering about when another Terminator will be made (the hints were fairly obvious). I would assume they would be inclined to begin work on it soon as Arnold isn't exactly in his golden years. And how anyone could possibly be fans of the original two movies and dislike this one is beyond my scope of comprehension. Needless to say I was impressed with this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the first two or just a movie fan in general.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Typically amazing rage against the machine for the first 6 songs on this cd, after which only average, less inspired songs play.  5 stars for the first half, 3 for the second, the average of which is 4.  Hence my rating.
0440237688|5.0|If you want a book that will make you think, then _The Giver_ is a book for you.  It is a thought provoking book in many ways.  It reminds us as citizens whose lives have also been changed by technology and the people who run the country, that just because we have the capability to do something, doesn't mean that we should.  Although many do not care for the open ending, I loved it because it made me feel hopeful for the future of Jonas and Gabriel.  A whole new land of color awaited them and it was full of music!
B000003TAR|5.0|This is Nirvana, and while its not the masterpiece Nevermind, it is still top notch and cannot be beaten.
B00005214X|5.0|I think, `All things must pass' is really good record. Its double album, released on 1970 (released as long play - it was triple album). Author is of course George Harrison. Both plates are more than 60 minutes of genial music. Overweight the rock songs - mostly role play electric guitar. Songs are mostly about Krishna and love, for example - `My sweet lord' - `I really wanna see you lord, but it takes so long'. Alike lyric in this song is playing all time, another twice few singing Hare Krishna mantra. George said once: `I wanna show realized of Hare Krishna mantra'.<BR> `Awaiting on you all' is about chanting the name of Krishna - `By chanting the name of the lord and you'll be free.' Thank songs like this all Hindus have respect for Harrison.<BR> From songs of love once interesting is `I live for you`. Most interesting lyrics are: `Only you keep my eyes open wide' or `in this darkness I wait for the day'. Another example is `What is life' - `tell me what my life without your love'. Those words accept this sing to songs of love.<BR> Record has additional tracks. Once of them is `its Johnny's birthday'. It's standard.<BR>Another additional track is `Thanks for the pepperoni'. It begins like `roll over Beethoven', but like half of minute it changes to improvisation, rests of those tracks are: `Plug me in' and `out of the blue'.<BR> And of course I don't forget about title song - `All things must pass'. It has very beautiful tone. It's not fast; it's playing slow, in grace. It's very beautiful.<BR> I must say some words about second version of `My sweet lord'. Its call `2000', `cause it was recorded in 2000. Acoustic guitar playing Dhani Harrison (George's son), and George gives vocal. <BR>`Hear me lord' is written like hymn to Krishna - `Forgive me lord, please those years when I ignored you'.<br /> I think, in this record more is positives than negatives. Playing in this record: <BR>Drums &amp; Percussion: Ringo Starr, Jim Gordon, Alan White<BR>Bass guitar: Klaus Voorman, Carl Radle<BR>Keyboards: Gary Wright, Bobby Whitlock, Bill Preston, Gary Brooker<BR>Pedal Steel Guitar: Pete Drake<BR>Guitar: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason<BR>Tenor saxophone: Bobby keys<BR>Trumpet: Jim Price<BR>Rhythm guitar &amp; Percussion: Badfinger<BR>Fender Rhodes &amp; Backing vocals on `I live for you', and acoustic guitar on `My sweet lord': Dhani Harrison<BR>Tambourine on `My sweet lord (2000)': Ray Cooper<BR>Additional Lead and Backing vocals on `My sweet lord (2000)': Sam Brown
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's finest as far as I am concerned, this album rocks to the very last.  From the blazing Fight Fire with Fire, to the lo to hi suicide tinged Fade to Black, this album is the best metal album ever made.
B000021Y77|5.0|This movie is unlike anything you've ever seen or will ever see again. Lola has 20 minutes to find 100,000 marks to save her boyfriend from the mob. The movie shows three different scenarios and how the smallest thing, such as tripping on the way down the stairs, can effect your entire life. Very cool. Its the only movie I've seen that I can say I notice something new each and every time I watch it. You will not be bored by this movie. Its one of the few movies I've ever seen that can combine action and suspense with an intelligent plot. A must see!!
B000002H33|5.0|A hair worse than Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets still carries all of the power and force of the previous album and is truly great to behold.  And the peasants rejoice.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has outdone themselves yet again. I cannot give this CD enough praise. I have and love their first album, but this cd just blows me away. The melodic songs are full of gorgeous chords.  I've told all my friends about this album. I've still to find someone who doesn't like it!On this album is the hit \\"Clocks\\", which actually turned me on to this cd. Its overplayed on the radio, but i'm still in love with it. Also, \\"Politik\\", which interspaces loud with quiet, and \\"In My Place\\" a beautiful song of encouragement. There are so many worthwhile songs on this album. Its not just enough to go to Borders and listen to it, or find clips of it online.  <br />Please find out for yourself how wonderful this cd is. Wholeheartedly reccomended.
B000001ELP|2.0|Like many, I was discouraged upon hearing this album when it first came out.  However, with time, some of these songs have grown on me (&quot;I&quot; being one example).  &quot;The Elder&quot; was a definite dud in terms of the complex concept album it tried to be, but I actually don't fault Kiss for trying to evolve somewhat, back when concept albums and Bob Ezrin were trendy entities in the music biz.  Who knows, maybe the boyz will be back someday with &quot;The Elder, Part II.&quot;  With all of their grown experience, I think they could do it...  <br />Hey, this isn't &quot;The Wall,&quot; but few albums are!!
0780628551|1.0|Everything has a reason, and this film exists sheerly to prove the truism &quot;all rules are made to be broken&quot;. There was once a time, you see, that one could take it on faith that &quot;any film that stars Johnny Depp can't be THAT bad&quot;.<br />Now, courtesy of The Astronaut's Wife, we know this not to be the case.<br />Not well scripted, not well acted, not well directed, not well written, not original, not artful, not entertaining, not even interesting.<br />Not good at all.
B00005JKZV|4.0|The Lord of the Rings films exist solely to entertain; no deep thoughts, complex storylines, or historical junk to get in the way!  Excellent visual effects, decent direction, and a much better version of the book (no long winded descriptions of things people don't care about here!) make it enjoyable.<br />Now, is it worthy of Best Picture?  No.  Is it worthy of the nomination?  No.  The films were nominated for the same reason Star Wars was: it brings forth brilliant new visuals.  It is nothing more than something too watch on a lazy, dog-dangling afternoon.  Doesn't mean it's bad, just that it ain't Best Picture material (though the third film will probably win).  Shut off your brain (for the most part) and enjoy.
0802130208|5.0|Ignatius T. Riely is rude. Ignatius T. Riely is fat. Ignatius T. Riely is  a loud, obnoxious, over-educated, under-achieving boob of a man. Yet somehow, when it comes to life, he just gets it.<br />Not only is this book funny as hell, it is deliciously thought-provoking wonderfully written. Worthy of as many stars as possible.
B00009MECF|5.0|This is a great movie it has hot stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and James Madio. They are great together and this is a great movie. They show their hot bodies a lot in this movie...see for yourself. A must see for Leo, and Marky Mark fans!! It had good acting and lessons too, the hot actors was a added bonus. In one scene you can see all of their rear ends, and in another a great view of James'.  Being a teenage guy I can relate to what the guys went through.
0385504209|2.0|I enjoy well written novels.  This one was well written for the first 100+ pages.  But faltered with the action and chase scenarios.  When the plot was developed I found myself not caring about it and lost the interest I had developed in the early stages of the novel.<br />A word of warning: the book should be previewed before purchase.  I would recommend reading pages 119-121, 124-126, and pages 231-233 to see if you are comfortable with the author's theme.  For those who are not, it would be a waste to purchase this book.
B00005JM09|1.0|The very fact that James Cameron didn't work behind the scenes should have been enough hint for me not bother wasting money on this movie. It wasn't, because like so many other Terminator fans I gave the film a chance.<br />And wasted 2 hours of my life.<br />Nothing original appears in film; every action scene and most dialog between the actors are recycled information from the first two movies. Nothing happens that's remotely exciting or even intense--the action is the same action from T2. Basically, nothing happens that even the youngest of moviegoers can't predict. Even the ending was cliche -- yes, of COURSE the attack happens else AI wouldn't exist to bother the Connors in the first place. And, of course, there's no central computer! Should that have been surprising? Where does everyone think the 'Net exists? In their microwave? Give me a freakin break.<br />I have no problem with the female terminator - it's not truly female anyway so why call it \\"Terminatrix?\\" - but she did the exact same things the T-1000 did and, of course, failed.  The \\"good\\" terminator was way out of character, which wasn't cool at all. Down right frustrating at times. One would think, after the last two attempts on Jon's life, that Jon's future self  (or whoever) would place some modifications on the newly re-programmed good terminator, but I guess us measly humans arent as practical as AI.<br />This wasnt a terminator movie; it was a bad attempt to make one.
B0000027RL|5.0|One of the best album of Pearl Jam. This is the album that makes me listen to other albums of Pearl Jam. I have been listening to this album from the time its being released but still now, I found it melodious.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I rated this at five stars, although four and one-half would be closer to the truth.  All of the arrangements on this CD are excellent, in my opinion. While rated as a Jazz CD (and released by the legendary Blue Note jazz label), more than a few of the songs here would be very at-home in a country setting. In a sense, just like the Dixie Chicks, she is a crossover artist - just in the wrong combination of genres!  The only weak spot on this recording is her voice - while still very full of potential, I sense that she still has to &quot;grow into her voice.&quot;  It's a bit early  to proclaim her the next Holiday, Krall or Washington yet, but given a few more years - and material of this caliber - I'm certain she'll get there.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I liked the music and lyrics of this album as U2's old albums.
B000069CWE|5.0|First of all I'd just like to say I loved the cd; but i'm not writing this review as a review. I've read a lot of the previous reviews written about this and there was something that annoyed me. &quot;H! VLTG3&quot; is the remix of &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;MY&lt;DSMBR&quot;  is the remix of &quot;My December&quot;--obviously. But, &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;My December&quot; aren't new, aren't unreleased, or lost tracks, or just made to be made into remixes, or anything like that. They are actual songs off of their very first album: Hybrid Theory EP which tracks include: &quot;Carousel,&quot; &quot;Technique,&quot; &quot;Step Up,&quot; &quot;And One,&quot; &quot;High Voltage,&quot; &quot;Part Of Me,&quot; and &quot;My December.&quot; Glad I cleared that up. The band is great. Try to find as much work by them as you can. The fusion of rock, rap, techno, classical, and unforgetably intelegent but dark poetry is amazing, so, uh. . .hmmm. . . .
6304696566|5.0|I can't agree with calling \\"The Searchers\\" an iliadic western.  If anything, it is the Odyssey of the West, as it tells the story of Ethan Edwards's five-year search for his kidnapped niece.  John Wayne gives a great performance (many people argue its his best) as Ethan Edwards, a tough, proud Civil War veteran who refused to give up and who is forced to spend years of his life searching for his niece, Debbie.  The journey, mostly set in the beautiful Monument Valley of Southern Utah, is truly a quest of epic proportions.  <br />The story is intriguing, the plot fast-moving and unpredictable, and the action exciting.  Wayne's performance as Edwards shows him in a darker, more unpredictable role than many of his other films, and that sun-baked, battle-hardened face covered with stubble is a visage that, in many ways, epitomizes the rough character of the American West. <br />The movie contains a number of stereotypes, from European settlers to Comanche Indians, that would not be considered politically correct today.  Despite this, however, this is a fine film by director John Ford, one that captivates from beginning to end.  Every list of the greatest Westerns of all time should include \\"The Searchers.\\"
0385720920|2.0|Now i am a huge fan of chucks works and have read all his books except for lulaby which i am in the process of now and this book at times was just down right boring. The plot is that there really isnt a huge on just mini sub plots about his mom him being jesus or somwthing and a whole load of other [stuff]. The begining was ok but twards the middle and end it just began to repet itself. Now if you would like to read a good book read survivor by chuck now that is a work of art and has a great story line (probley one of my fav books)
0385507755|2.0|The book's opening snagged me.  From there it all went disappointingly down-hill.  For me, there's very little new here.  Frey's stream-of-conscious, run-on sentences made the physical act of reading the book very difficult.  I found myself tripping up and having to re-read passages.  I also had to read this book in small intervals.  Frey as the main character is extremely angry, bitter, stubborn and hateful, it's hard to want to spend much time with him or any of the other people in this book.  The overwhelming negativity throughout actually forced me to take twice as long to read.  I would have stopped reading if I wasn't such a completist.  However, kudos to one of the coolest book covers in a long time.  It's quite fetching!
B00005JLEU|4.0|Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase of LILO AND STITCH) is a young girl holidaying with her parents when they come across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. But upon arriving and discovering a smorgasboard lined up. The only problem is this banquet is for the spirits, and them only. Naturally, Mum and Dad indulge in the deadly sin of gluttony and for their greed are literally turned into pigs. (But who wouldn't when there's free food on offer?).<BR>So on the advice of her new friend Haku, Chirhiro must travel into the spirit world in order to have her parents restored to human form. On her quest she encounters many interesting and imaginative characters such as The Radish Spirit and a giant baby. Chrihiro also runs afoul of the evil witch Yubabba and her kind twin  sister Zeniba (both voiced by Suzanne Pleshette).<BR>While at two hours it seems a bit too long, Writer/Director Hayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY is an original and imaginative animated feature that puts Hollywood made fodder to shame. Both kids and adults will enjoy it, though parental guidance is recommended for younger children who may find it scary. And as with LILO AND STITCH, the P.C police will find ammo (Or more aptly, blanks) to give them an excuse to get up on their pedestals and rant to like-minded people about how &quot;evil&quot; movies like this are. Which is of course utter poppycock. But parents should have a look at it first before deciding to let young kids view it. Personally I found the Oompa Loompas in WILLY WONKA to be more frightening than SPIRITED AWAY.  This is good rainy day viewing for kids of all ages- including 23 year old kids like me.
B00009TB5G|3.0|...but a good cigar is a smoke. Seriously, I have to get into the \\"purist\\"-\\"anti-purist\\" argument about The Two Towers. As someone points out, you can't film faithfully any of the books in The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the space of a normal movie--you'd need 15-20 hours, who knows? That means leaving parts out, and the Director making choices about what to portray, etc. BUT, to my mind, that does not mean gratuitously changing and altering important parts of the book that had a real and serious meaning in the overall vision and mythology of Tolkien. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out why it was important the Elves were not at Helm's Deep. There are a number of instances like this. Why, why, why? is what I'd ask Peter Jackson. I can understand why you have to cut things out; but why are you putting things in?--that you've made up? Changing meanings? You can't improve on Tolkien, my friend, the richness and depth of his imagination and, most important, the subtly and understatement of his characterizations and emotions. Neither your version of the Aragorn-Arwen romance, nor the Battle of Helm's Deep, is as compelling as what is portrayed in the literature. And it's not that movies are a different medium; using Tolkien's original conception of them would have made the films better, not worse.  Aragorn falling over a cliff?--puh-leeze
B00005JM09|5.0|Terminator 3 is great!  The effects, the action, the humor, the thrill, and the most fascinating twists in the entire store line were amazing.  They appear to be keeping consistent with Time Theory.  However, the ending was a bit sad and apocalyptic, the movie was great overall.<br />Truthfully, I probably would have waited until the movie was on DVD before watching if Kristanna Loken wasn't in it... hehe  I still remember her from the days of the Mortal Kombat tv series.
B000065V3M|5.0|Why make a movie that pays homage to the man universally regarded as the worst filmmaker of all time?<br />Well, simply because the word \\"worst\\" doesn't even adequately describe Ed Wood. He was the ABSOLUTE worst, unrivalled in his consistently mindless disregard for decent production values, intelligent scriptwriting, coherent storytelling, and competent acting. If he were just \\"the worst,\\" he would be no more than a mere footnote in filmmaking history. But by single-handedly redefining the standards of ineptitude, Wood achieved that rare status of lovable loser. I mean really, you have to admire someone who pursues his craft with so much grit and determination and so little talent.<br />It may seem ironic at first, but it makes pertect sense that this story of z-grade moviemaking requires an a-grade cast. And we have one, in Johnny Depp as Ed Wood, Martin Landau (in an Oscar-nominated performance) as Bela Lugosi, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, Jeffery Jones as Criswell, George Steele as Tor Johnson, and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge. Think about it: these people had to recreate the filming of Wood's movies, deliver their lines like rank amateurs, look serious but come out funny, and do all that with a straight face. Try that, folks.<br />Appreciate too, the film's most unforgettable line. At the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space, Wood declares with unqualified conviction, \\"Yes, this is the one I'll be remembered for.\\" <br />Whether you're a fan of bad movies or not, you just have to see Ed Wood. It's not often that a film comes along that makes you root for a man who so admirably succeeded at being a failure.
B00005JM09|4.0|This newest Terminator movie contained no real surprises except for the ending, which departed significantly from the spirit of the first two films.  And it is worth seeing for that ending, which is a satisfying conclusion to the series.<br />Terminator 3's ending, however, would not have been applicable (taking into account the logic of movie-imagination story-telling) if a certain concluding scene had not been cut from Terminator II, which completely precluded the third film's ending.  But it might not have mattered, even if that scene had been included, and we might have had a third Terminator film anyway.  Look what they did to the TV series Felicity at the end, where time-warps and dreams and everything else managed to bring the show to an close -- and see how James Bond has been about the same age onscreen for about 40 years now.  In the movies, anything can happen.<br />At any rate, the girl Terminator was a lot better looking than Ah-nuld.
B000001GQJ|5.0|If I were forced to eliminate my entire collection of classical recordings with the exception of one CD, this would be that CD. In short, it encompasses all of what Martha Argerich stands for as an artist; there is the unbridled passion, sensitivity, and inhuman virtuosity that all of her fans are all too familiar with. Every single work on this CD is a gem. The Chopin Scherzo is a piece Argerich has recorded several times, and here, it is as exciting as she has ever played it. The Brahms Rhapsodies are full of passion and possess a certain degree of maturity one may not at first suspect from such a firebrand virtuoso, and the Ravel is complete with shimmering textures and brilliantly original rubatos. The highlights of the disc, however, are the Liszt and Prokofiev performances. Argerich plays the opening of the Hungarian Rhapsody in a suitably pompous, almost arrogant manner, and the speed and audacity of the octave section is simply mind-boggling. The Prokofiev Toccata receives the best performance on record (Horowitz is the only competition, but his cuts are unnecessary and his additions superfluous). The Liszt Sonata is simply scintillating; Argerich manages to bring together the structural finesse of Pollini and the emotional intensity and impetuousness of Zimerman. This CD will amaze, enlighten, inspire, and hypnotize any lover of the repertoire. I give it the highest recommendation possible...wait, no, higher!
B00005AR3G|4.0|\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is a unique film in the vaults at Disney.  It plays with the audience instead of in front of the audience, and the burning sarcasm of the emperor's character isn't found in any other Disney flick.  Unfortunately, this movie seems to be cursed by the idea that any Disney movie has to be done on a grand scale and end with some great moral truth.  Why can't a Disney movie just be fun?<br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" doesn't seem to draw as much attention as other Disney fare.  It just kind of quietly appeared and then went away.  That's a shame.  It got the same treatment from Disney that a lot of their direct-to-video/DVD movies received.  At least \\"Hercules\\" got headlines for its bad, although undeserved, reviews.  \\"Hercules\\" has always been erroneously treated like a red-headed stepchild compared to other Disney movies, \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is treated like an abortion.  You rarely here anything about this film.  Like \\"Hercules,\\" it doesn't fit the bill as a standard Disney movie.  It doesn't try to force it's morals upon you, and you won't be enlightened by any of the dialogue, but you will laugh.  Kids will love it for the emperor-turned-llama silliness and adults will love it for the relationship between Spade and John Goodman.  Eartha Kitt is glorious as Yzma, the villain in this tale.  Patrick Warburton is perfect as Kronk, her sidekick.<br />Spade talks directly to the viewer as he narrates his tale, and makes sure throughout that you know the story is about him, and no one else.  There is also a lot of adult humor in the film as well, much like in \\"Hercules.\\"<br />So, this movie is a fun-time film.  You won't be sorry to watch it, and your kids will love it as well.  They may not be drawn to the characters as much as they would to a Belle, Snow White, or Simba, but they will enjoy this story.  So will you.
B000002G60|5.0|This album is perhaps Vega's best work (though I do have difficulty choosing which is my favorite of her albums!). <br />The concept for the album is creative: nine songs naming nine things that are so often desired by both her and the masses.  Some of these desires include family (for Vega, her daughter and then-husband), sex, money, death, and oh yeah, a plum.  The songs are varied in theme, lyrics, and sound, but they flow nicely.  <br />Lyrically, Vega is frank and open about her topics, in a gritty, decidedly honest way.  \\"World Before Columbus\\" is one song that definitley speaks Vega's mind, describing how she treasures her daughter about any material item that she could possibly obtain.  It is songs such as this that the listener can relate to.  Each song's mood seems familiar, something that has been experienced in everday life.  <br />Varying from upbeat to mellow and slow, this album has a smooth, hip sound.  It incorporates jazz as well as the folk sound that has been so prominent on most of Vega's work.  It shows an interesting development in Vega's style that is both unexpected and enjoyable.<br />This is a great CD, and I would recommend it to anyone.
0156027321|5.0|A stunning book about a boy, an orangatan, a hyena, a wounded zebra, a 450 pound pussy cat, Richard Parker, and God.<br />I love this sentence...\\"This book was born as I was hungry\\"<BR>because we all are hungry for something- love, success, fame, fortune, God. <BR> Yes, mostly God.<br />Pi is on a life-boat with all these animals, but eventually ends up with only the tiger.  <BR>\\"It was not a question of him Or me, but of him And me.\\"  Pi says.<br />Yann Martel shows us the colors, smells, tastes, textures, dangers, and pleasures of the sea. <br />He introduces us to Pi...who has come to the conclusion that the presence of God is the only lasting elevation which endures...<br />And this,<br />is what allows him to survive and live, and love, inspite of everything.<br />I loved this book. Martel's writing is beautiful. His imagination is beyond anything I have ever read and I am still thinking of Pi and Richard Parker whom I have grown to love.<br />Note-  the reader will not be disappointed ... but become a better person for having read this book!
B00005JL78|3.0|I hate to say this because I really enjoy Tom Cruise movies (and he looks eerily like my little brother) but this movie was not all it was cracked up to be.<br />The plot would have been so much better than this.  So much better.  With just the right imagination, more chase scenes and intricate plot could have been added to fill in the gaps of the storyline.  <br />Rent it but only when it's on sale or you have a free movie credit.
B00005JM09|5.0|I feared the worst for Terminator 3. Its premise is almost identical to T2's (Schwarzenegger Terminator heads back in time to save John Connor), the ads looked terrible, and on paper, this looked like the pitch perfect example of a popular series ruined by money-hungry studio executives. While I have no doubt the producers of this film acted out of greed, I can safely say my fears were unfounded. Terminator 3 is easily the summer's best pure blockbuster.<br />It's been several years since John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) helped bring down Skynet. But he's still frightened by the possibilities of the future, so he spends his days as a wandering nomad, his identity deleted, hopefully making him impossible to detect. His fears prove justified. A new design, the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), is sent back in time to assassinate Connor and his future lieutenants. As before, a Terminator who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent as Connor's lone protector. Added into the crisis is Kate Brewster (Clair Danes), whose presence will play a vital role into the fate of the planet's future.<br />The possible signs of sequilitis are present here, but despite essential similarities to T2 director Jonathan Mostow crafts the movie with a look and feel that separates it from its predecessors, but does so without betraying its roots. That's a pretty fantastic accomplishment. But before I make T3 sound like nothing more than a high-gloss rip-off,the movie does deliver an engaging story filled with genuine surprises and complications. It works as a continuation of its predecessor's legacy, and surprisingly, never feels the slightest bit gratuitous. <br />The action sequences are the movie's highlight, especially an astounding car chase that puts the one in The Matrix Reloaded to shame. Expect shootouts and plenty of explosions, but delivered with flair and energy. The last half-hour is virtually non-stop action, and Mostow maintains a high pitch of intensity. Most impressive of allis the one-on-one showdown between the Terminators, probably the most exhilarating action setpiece I've seen all year.<br />What surprised me the most was the attention paid to the characters. Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor is entirely likeable and convincing, blowing all memories of Edward Furlong's annoying performance to dust. Clair Danes, who I've never been a big fan of, is also quite good as the requisite-but-not-quite love interest (I loved the twist involving her character and the Terminator). <br />Schwarzenegger puts forth his most memorable portrayal of a Terminator, playing his role with a great sense of circumstantial humor. T3 is packed with big laughs (the best being the sunglassses bit), thanks mostly to Schwarzenegger's sense of comic timing. This is his comeback piece, and it's good to see the big lug back and better than ever. As his villainous counterpart, Kristanna Loken is imposing as the Terminatrix, and bound to drive male teens crazy with her great figure (her nude scene frustratingly shows very little).<br />Terminator 3's countdown to worldwide armageddon adds a sense of desperation its predecessors were missing. The suspenseful build-up concludes satisfyingly in an ending that actually surprised and delighted me. Sure, the set up leaves another sequel a possibility, but I actually can't wait for a Terminator 4.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Resident Evil is a movie version of what is called \\"Survival Horror\\" in the gaming industry.  The ideas and a number of scenes are directly inspired by the Resident Evil Games.<br />Milla wakes up, naked in a shower and has no memory of the past.  She is in a large mansion.  Soon she is beset by commandos who claim she is one of them and that they work for the Umbrella Corporation.  In the mansion is an underground train station that leads to a large underground research facility that is in trouble.<br />In the facility, known as The Hive, the team is trying to shut down an AI computer that killed everyone in the facility.  Aside from the killer AI, there are plenty of zombies and even a monster.  The team must defeat these and get out before the facility becomes completely sealed.<br />Milla's character is central to the movie and she slowly regains her memories as the plot advances.  We come to know her better and feel sympathetic for her.<br />All of this is bound up and painted with classic elements of horror and action and blended so well you don't really notice the switches.  Camera angles, stunts and atmosphere really push the viewer's buttons and keep the fear and adrenaline running.<br />As the film nears its conclusion, the viewer tries to guess just what is going to happen and how it will be resolved, but the surprises keep coming until the final scene.<br />Very fun with a minimum of blood and gore for this type of movie, but with plenty of action and spookiness.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is Shakira's first English album. While it really blows when compared to her previous two records Donde Estan Los Ladrones and Pies Descalzos, it is still great. Learning English (especially at the age of 20) is not an easy task, and composing in a language you have just learned is even harder, and I think Shakira has done a great job. <BR>As usual, Shakira has either written or co-written all her songs. Whenever, Wherever is one of the most refreshing songs I've heard in a while even from popular English-speaking artists. Shakira has once again managed to do something unique - her song Objection (Tango) and its Spanish translation Te Aviso, Te Anuncio have classical tango openings. Underneath Your Clothes is a nice ballad, although Shakira's accent shows a bit too much there. The One is also a nice ballad and the lyrics in that song are really well-done. There are two brand new Spanish songs on this CD - Te Dejo Madrid and Que Me Quedes Tu. Te Dejo Madrid has a nice rock tune, while the other song is a nice ballad. The rest are pretty good rock songs. There is quite a bit of variety on this CD, although not as much as on Donde Estan Los Ladrones. Sometimes the lyrics don't really make sense, but that can be easily ignored/overlooked because the tunes are so great. <BR>Since this is her first English album, a few weaknesses are expected, but her next album will most likely be a lot better.
0156027321|4.0|I have seen this book on the best sellers list for quite a while and I must admit I hesitated when a copy became available at the library.  The entire plot, a young Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger, just seemed ludicrous.  I could not understand how the author could ever pull such a concept off.  Well thankfully, I picked up the book and started to read over the Fourth of July holiday.  When two days later I had finally re-read the last 10 pages for the third time, I put the book down and thought, Well Yann Martel has managed the impossible!  He did make the story not only credible but has written a beautiful story about love, loss, courage, and struggle.<br />Expertly written and plotted, I especially enjoyed the small chapters which made the story flow so much better and the interjected narrative, revealing Pi's life after he endured his hardship.  But what struck me the most, was the beautiful narrative voice of the author.  He made humans and animals come alive.<br />But the last ten pages of the book!  How much different would the book be perceived without those last ten pages?  Hard to tell, except for me, they made the book much more than just a struggle to endure.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something a little different.  Take a weekend and immerse yourself in a book that is a joy to read and then recommend it to everyone you know.

B00008NG5V|5.0|&quot;ALOHA!&quot; Just thought I'd give my accolades to this pro-surfer from Hawaii. He's a righteous, dude! I recently bought the 2nd installment of Jack's latest album release &quot;On And On.&quot; This is much better than the first one. It's more refined and lively, unlike his ground-breaking album &quot;Brushfire Fairytales,&quot; in which it comes-off sounding a little melancholy. This one's a little more upbeat, with songs like &quot;Times Like These,&quot; &quot;The Horizon Has Been Defeated,&quot; &quot;Traffic In The Sky,&quot; and &quot;Symbol In My Driveway&quot; are ambiguous, metaphorical-terms, about Jack's unique-perspectives he shares with the meaning of life. He makes some powerful statements - to scratching the surface - thereby giving credence to some of the problems we all face in the world today: with political-unrest, wars and rumors of wars, pollution in our skies, etc.... <br />With Jack's gentle-percussion in the compositons, and the rootsy/regae-tinge for which he is noteably-recognized for, makes for a pleasant and relaxing album to listen to. It's a solid-piece of work that doesn't have any holes or &quot;filler-tunes&quot; in it. There are some other artists music that you'll listen to, and you'll be thinking to yourself: &quot;the music is all broken-up, with all the extraneous- cacaphony, with no uniform-whole.&quot; Jack has lived-up to the reputation as an artist who puts his heart-and-soul into his music. The music on this album is warm and soothing. Just when you thought the music industry was going south - it all of a sudden rose from the dust like a (paradox) phoenix, finding it's place in this &quot;crazy-world,&quot; with the [rebirth] of Jack's real music - that's unadulterated - in it's pure-form. I'm one who can attest, he's come to save (pacify) the world from all the insidious-garbage which seems to proliferate the music industry, these days. With his unassuming-demeanor and amicable-personality, he exemplifies what a good artist is all about. He's a force to be reckoned with, nonetheless. I could go &quot;On And On&quot; about Jack's 2nd album, it's awesome!
0688170528|3.0|Ok, let me start by saying this...I love reading books.  Especially books that really touch my soul.  This book, although the story was very well thought out and it does trigger certain emotions in you, it is not one that i have enjoyed reading.  Yes, i cried at the end, cried for the characters and for what they lost (life, love and lifelong friendship, on everyone's account) but did i enjoy to read it.  NO!  Personally, i like positive books, ones where i can smile at the end.  This book made me mad.  Of course i was happy with the end result of the trial, but i was very upset and angry with how the lives of the characters turned out.
B00005JLRT|1.0|This laughable rehashing of the Wrath of Kahn features people we used to know and love and now have grown tired and weary of their own legendary status. The embarrassing 18 million dollar opening weekend stated solidly that this is the worst Trek film since #5, the final Frontier. I was a huge fan of the series and I loved First Contact and I really thought this was going to be a powerful last entry in the Trek mythos and yet I got tired dialogue from tired actors who obviously didn't want to be there. <BR> The writer, John Logan (co-writer on Gladiator) bragged ahead of time that he had a great idea about #11 and he'd bust up that old track record of the even number films being good ones and odd bad. Well, not to worry, he already busted up THAT record. Don't waste your money.
0060537639|5.0|I approached this book with the curiousity of an amateur historian and, admittedly, with a good deal of skepticism.  After all, how could such a monumental journey that led to the discovery of not only North and South America, but also Antarctica and Australia, and the full circumnavigation of the globe along multiple tracks have escaped from the annals of history?  I expected a great deal of circumstantial evidence, and of this there is plenty, but to my astonishment, Menzies presents multiple incidents of physical evidence -- shipwrecks and construction dotted across the globe.  Couple this with well-documented references from the writings of the European explorers, who apparently made no effort to hide their knowledge that they were travelling in the wake of others.<br />Menzies presents multiple lines of evidence -- pre-Columbian maps, displaced plant and animal populations, native folklore, clusters of Asian DNA in the Americas, shipwrecks, monuments, and writings, among others -- that when viewed as a whole provide a strong case of Chinese exploration and colonization prior to the Europeans.  By the author's own admission, quite a bit of this evidence is still rudimentary, but the outpouring of scholarship this book has seemed to trigger promises to flesh out this thesis and refine the debate.<br />Menzies' thesis is not without criticism -- the lack of contact with Europe despite the fleet's charge to bring the entire world into the Chinese tribute system is a most prominent omission and not addressed in the book.  Other claims seem terribly far-fetched (hints of Chinese copper mining as far inland as Michigan's Upper Peninsula), but I'm optimistic that over time the core thesis of the Chinese discovery of the Americas will be validated.<br />Almost overshadowed at the end of the book is an assertion by Menzies that the Portugese, using Chinese knowledge, established thriving colonies in the Caribbean as early as the 1440's.  While the Chinese records may have indeed been destroyed, some record of this Portugese settlement must have been preserved.  This is a curious claim supported by underwhelming evidence that deserves comment as it stands to harm the credibility of the more convincing case of Chinese discovery if it proves false.  Perhaps this is a readily-available lead that needs to be taken up in the near-term in order to clarify the debate?<br />The knee-jerk criticism of this work is Menzies non-academic background.  However, I'm convinced on reading the book that this is actually his greatest strength.  Menzies approaches his thesis with his knowledge as a navigator and seaman and without the peer pressure of convential wisdom, and this seems to allow him to 'connect the dots' in ways a traditional book-bound academic could never realize.  I caution that one reviews the motives of the sharpest-tongued critics before passing judgement on such criticism.<br />This book is clearly the starting point of a debate that promises to rage for decades.  I'm eager to observe the response as the case now goes before peer review.  This promises to begin a significant awakening that American history has a much richer heritage than just its European roots.  If nothing else, the valuable surge in pre-Columbian scholarship will enrich our American culture.  Now, let the debate begin!

0060931671|5.0|The Crying of Lot 49 is an amazingly rich and complex work, especially when you consider its slim, novella-like size. Thomas Pynchon is widely recognized as among the most brilliant of postwar writers, and this is the perfect introduction to his work. It has the themes, the multitude of characters, and the diverse interests of Pynchon's more sprawling tomes, but its size makes it more manageable.<br />Which is not to say that it is a breeze--in fact, I'm sure I missed things in my first reading that will become more clear the second or third time around. The plot itself is quite complicated, and when you consider the book's brevity, the cast of characters can seem almost Tolstoyan (they tend to walk on and disappear later in an endless stream). Also, Pynchon makes good use of some richly gothic prose equal to anything by the deadly serious Faulkner or Cormac McCarthy--but we can rarely be sure if we should take Pynchon's prose at face value.<br />The first thing you'll probably notice here is the sheer humor. Just the names of the characters make me laugh: Oedipa and \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Dr. Hilarius, \\"Bloody\\" Chiclitz, Arnold Snarb. And as usual with Pynchon, you can count on a generous helping of hilarous, sometimes awful, songs. Try the corporate ditties from the Yoyodyne Aerospace company. This book had me practically rolling on the floor again and again.<br />The story centers on Oedipa Maas, the very likeable young woman saddled with the unfortunate task of executing the estate of Pierce Inverarity, her former lover. As she attempts to get his affairs in order, she becomes increasingly entangled in what may or may not be a worldwide conspiracy called the Tristero (also spelled Trystero). This conspiracy evidently began as a sort of terrorist group opposed to the mail-carrying family Thurn und Taxis, who really did have a monopoly of postal services in Europe for many decades. Thurn und Taxis are represented by the symbol of a post-horn, so Tristero chose a muted post-horn as its sign.<br />All this is meticulously researched by Pynchon, who's interests and reading experience seems to be endless. We get accurate information here about entropy and the perpetual-motion concept of Maxwell's Demon, the Thurn und Taxis family, Elizabethan Drama--too much to list here. Speaking of Elizabethan drama, Pynchon also includes the best parody of a revenge play ever written.<br />There is much more than knockabout humor here. The dreamlike night scene in San Francisco, when Oedipa keeps seeing the muted post horn again and again, is richly evocative, the scene in which Oedipa comforts the old man in his apartment is surprisingly touching, and near the end Pynchon gives us some eloquent philosophizing, but without interrupting the novel's flow. These scenes stick in the mind as much as the hilarous comedy parts with Metzger, the rock band The Paranoids, and the ex-Nazi psychiatrist Dr. Hilarius.<br />I wouldn't ever give away the ending, but be forewarned that it is enigmatic. If you want Dickensian wrap-up, don't touch this with a 30-foot pole. But it's not just the ending that's open: critics tend to agree that one of the major characteristics of Lot 49 is interpretive openness throughout--almost any event can be read in more than one way. Most salient is the question (raised by Pynchon himself) of whether the Tristero is real, a practical joke, or just in Oedipa's mind. This uncertainty is what fuels the claustrophobic paranoia in the book--a Pynchon trademark.<br />Other things are left unclear as well. For instance, what does Pierce Inverarity have to do with the plot? The Tristero seems inextricably tied in with him, and his last name, as at least one critic has pointed out, seems to suggest untruth. Pynchon leaves open the possiblity that the Tristero is simply the posthumous masterpiece of the jokester Inverarity. Another possiblity, mentioned by Harold Bloom, (though he doesn't agree with it) is that \\"lot 49\\" is related to 49 days after Passover--in other words, Pentecost is just around the corner. Pentecostalism is mentioned by one of the characters in the parodistic play, so we have yet another interpretation on our hands.<br />I'm pretty certain Pynchon intends for us to be mystified by all this, and that he doesn't know himself whether the Tristero is real or \\"what happens\\" after the end of the book. Extrapolating this mystification to the whole universe is an easy step to take, and clearly embodies Postmodern thought-- a system which has essentially given up the search for truth and assumes that, though many hypotheses can be proposed, the universe is ultimately inscrutable. Though I disagree with Pynchon's conclusions, they are very well-written conclusions. I couldn't accept the philosophical secion near the end, but I enjoyed reading it. I also enjoyed the ending very much after I got over its bizarreness, and it's strangely effective, even infuriatingly delightful.<br />I'm annoyed by the fact that books are never reviewed for content the way movies are, so I'll briefly mention that here. This book is pretty much fine for high schoolers, with hardly any language and just a bit of sex--about one page. It's refreshing to see a living writer give us an effective book without the gratuitous vulgarity which characterizes so much modern literature.<br />In short, if you're looking for a piece of fiction a cut above the fluff which comprises 99% of current publications, read The Crying of Lot 49, and don't let the gothic prose daunt you. It'll have you in stitches, and make you think hard about some philosophical questions too.
B000001FTA|5.0|Contrary to other reviews, Brian Robertson played the far better solos on this album.Opium trail and killer without a cause are both Brians solos.Turn up your amp to full power and just listen to the wailing solo on opium trail.Stunning stuff!
B00005JM09|5.0|The movie has a story that continues from Terminator2. The plot is good, storyline is tight. It doesn't bore you for a second. Lot of action, which is much better that the previous 2 terminator movies. Music is also better. The previous 2 were also good. Characters are developed. In a nutshell, this is a MUST see movie of the year. And if you are a Terminator fan, then see it multiple times.....
0553812173|5.0|Although this book deserves 5 stars, I would probably have given it 4.5 just so that I could give the rest of the books in the series a higher rating. It is a great beginning, but the series improves with each volume as you are drawn further and further into a world as inventive as any world in fantasy fiction. By the time it is finished, it will be one of the best fantasy series ever written.<br />Yes, the books are complex and hard to read at times, but it is worth the effort. One of my favorite activities is to reread a book and not have the same experience. With this series, you continually find new depth and relationships within the book as well as with the other books in the series. You find yourself saying \\"Oh, yeah\\" as something clicks into place and you realize the vastness and inventiveness of the author's vision. <br />There are no stereotypical good and evil characters. At times you even loose track of where your sympathies lie. Good characters do evil things and vice versa. You are given the motivations of each side of a conflict and each might seem equally compelling. In other cases, the true motivation may not be revealed until the next book in the series. There are plots and counterplots and manipulations interwoven through series. But, for most, there are no decisions other than what it takes to survive.<br />Erikson also provides great visual descriptions, both of the geography and the non-human characters. And that is something to note; nothing ruins a great fantasy or SF story more than when the author veers from inventive to ridiculous (for example, Jar Jar Binks). The non-humans in Malazan are convincing, very individualized and can be very scary...

0738206679|1.0|Popular science sells, no doubt about it. Authors like Barabasi<br />know how to exploit the science-thirsty public in the following way: their writing appeals to many people, ranging from pseudo-mathematicians to readers of Foreign Review, by making them believe that they understand some deep new phenomena. Undoubtedly, the average reader will not search the bibliography to discover that many of the papers cited in this book, including Barabasis's papers, are scientifically and mathematically empty. While it is true that some of the models described in this book can LEAD to interesting science and mathematics, the author does not have the skills to do so.<br />The author and his collaborators just OBSERVE certain phenomena<br />and come up with simple models, which they are unable to analyze<br />mathematically. Instead, they perform simulations and experiments. The book impresses the reader by supposedly showing<br />connections between modern physics and networks. Read the chapter<br />on the Bose Einstein condensation and its role to the Microsoft<br />domination in the software market and, if you know something<br />about both subjects, you will laugh your heart out at the author's naivete. Why does the author not try to do serious physics but, rather, attempts to deal with a subject like this?<br />Because it is a quick path to fame. He merely sells science to non-scientists, in a rude, awckward, non-scientific, impolite,<br />self-promoting manner. He basically insults the average reader's<br />intellectual ability. The contents of the book can be summarized<br />in at most 10 pages. The story is repetitive. To be sure [sic],<br />Barabasi uses an eloquent language and hides repetition under the rug. Check some of the papers cited in the book. Check, e.g.,<br />the paper of Faloutsos et al., to see that the authors of this--allegedly important article--did not observe that two of the functions they estimated are inverses of one another and hence there was noneed to perform the experiment anew. (Either Barabasi did not read the paper or he did not understand the<br />math in it... Yet he did cite it.) I mostly like the chapter where the author concludes that in order to attack a network you really need to attack its hubs. Let's get serious now. Do you need Quantum Statistics to predict that? Well, sorry, if a funding agency is willing to fund research that results in such<br />conclusions, then, I regret to say, public funds are going down the drain. It's not the first nor the last time this happens.<br />But, to be sure [sic], Barabasi is grinning while reading my review: he surely knows that no matter what I say he remains firm in his sand-castle kingdom; he knows that my review is irrelevant and that the readers of his book, the students of his classes, the program directors of his funding agencies, and the general public are closing their ears.

This isn't a stand out song like the others.<BR>5.Hit The Floor-10/10 this is a good mix of hard rock and rap. This is a headbanger song.<BR>6.Easier To Run-10/10 this is the same type of slow song as crawling and it has really good lyrics.<BR>7.Faint-12/10 THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM IT IS FAST PACED AND HAS RAP AND SCREAMING IN IT AND IT HAS GREAT DRUMMBING BY ROB THE DRUMMBER ON THIS TRACK!<BR>8.Figure.09-10/10 This is an awsome song it has great lyrics and chester tears the song up with his singing<BR>9.Breaking The Habbit-10/10 This is a great slow song.

B00008J4P5|3.0|It annoys me to see such an amateur album accumulate so much praise. Has the Rock community simply ignored White Stripes' blatant atttempt to rip off previous rock legends? <br />This album is nothing more than a 'cut and paste' project. I don't claim to be a knowledgable historian of Rock music, which is all the more baffling.... because the tunes are instantly familiar. Every single song incorporates a collection of various samples that spans rock history. I'm not one to be dissapointed by influenced music, I realise that influence is the dynamic process of evolution and in fact I rarely complain about copyright infringement, but this album has clearly stepped over the hazy line. <br />The first song is the only stand out song and typically the most advertised. Its the only song that comes close to being original (I think) and the lyrics are powerful enough to induce emotion. \\"And if I catch you coming back my way... I'm gonna serve it to you!\\"<br />I have read countless reviews that claim this album is one of few modern creations that truly capture pure rock. That's not far from the truth, but if this is what you are looking for, then you are kidding yourself, because its simply a collage of distinguished rock moments, that any learning garage band can whip up for a school party. Turn yourself to 'The Strokes' and you will find a pure rock album pleasantly influenced but strong enough to stand on its own two feet. <br />Oh and someone should file for a restraining order to keep that girl as far away from the microphone as possible. She has no vocal talent and summons very little emotion.
0553573403|5.0|Wow, is the first word that I though of when I finished the book, then darn, because the book was over. I generally judge a book by the feelings that the book gives you as you read the book. Let me tell you that this book wrenched from happiness to sadness to even disappointment. NOT disappointment of the book, but of decisions those darn characters make. Some times I had to put down the book because those darn emotions got the better of me I just got so angry, sad, or happy, that I needed to cool down before I continued reading. Now that is what a good piece of the written word can do for you, that is the power of words. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a thousand words can move you more and for longer.<br />Alas, sorry children, this book, and I suppose this series, is not for the faint of heart. This is a hardcore fantasy series, with graphic fighting and graphic sex. The characters are in the gray, and there are not many black or white, good or bad characters.

0380778556|5.0|I used 3 days to read this book and in this period, I can't help to stop reading. This opening is fantastic! Du Maurier used two chapters to explain the feelings in the Narrator after the incident. It's hard to follow, but I reccomand you to read the first two chapters after you have finished the book. At that time you will understand the meaning of it.<br />By the way, I think Hollywood should do a revival edition of Rebecca after Hitchcock. It's worth to try! When I was reading the book, I always pictured that Gwyneth Paltrow as the nameless Mrs. de Winter, Edward Norton (with beard or moustache) as Max de Winter, Maggie Smith as Mrs. Danvers and Kevin Spacey as Frank Crawley. It is the brillant cast in my imagination. I was highly reccomand to do it.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Finally!! An \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" for this generation, but this film has something for all age groups. Deliciously bizarre, but warm-hearted enough even for the fluffiest Disney fanatic!
0316666343|4.0|Well, I must say, I really like \\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold. I kept waiting for the book to turn, but it never did.  I had heard disparaging remarks, such as the gruesome way the death was written and the abandonment by the mother.  I think the topic of grief can be overwhelming for some.<br />The Salmon family is fractured by the death of Susie, 14. But even a badly broken bone eventually heals, and so does this family. <br />Maybe because I knew what to expect in the first chapter, but honestly, I expected it to be so much gorier.  Written from Suzie's perspective, the emotions rang true without being sensational.<br />For the rest of the book, we see Suzie's view of her family and friends coming to grips with her death.  I have found that I was able to sympathize with just about every character. I was deeply touched when the father finally told his four-year-old son that his sister was dead.  I was forgiving of the mother's need to find her own path of grief.<br />I find Sebold's concept of heaven an interesting one as well.  Not much to begin with, it becomes what the dead person imagines it to be.  Suzie's began merely as high school, a place that she never got to experience.  As she matured, so did her heaven. <br />I found it to be a moving, well-written story.
B00005JM09|3.0|Schwarzenegger's return is not a disappointment and his performance comes in at a level consistent with the previous two works in this series. T2 still ranks as the best of the Terminator films and this one is at least a strong second, simply because the story line works very, very well. I won't go into story line details, mostly because it would spoil the film for those who haven't seen it yet.<br />Performance-wise, Arnold's back and suitably credible. His nemisis (played by Kristanna Loken) could have been computer generated -- well, she was in many cases -- for all the acting the role required. In a way, it matched that of Mathilda May in Lifeforce, but was, to say the least, a lot less interesting. Once you see the film (and if you've seen Lifeforce), you'll understand the comparison. Claire Danes, on the other hand, turned in a credible adult performance, though it doesn't come up to the standards for an academy award (she needs more work in the emoting emotions department). Nick Stahl is similarly suitable, but their (his and Danes') interaction is pushed and even rushed, so they lack the on-screen time to develop a plausible relationship. That doesn't ruin the film, but it does knock it down a notch or two, in my opinion.<br />Pacing is consistent, even if more work could have been done with character development. From minute one, the film does not slow or lose sight of its target (unlike The Hulk, which seemed to wander without purpose).<br />Now to the spoiler warning: the ending leaves one a bit on the cold side, but given the film's nature, the ending is very much in keeping with the series and begs for a fourth installment. Given that, Arnold will surely be back, if for no other reason, than a cameo appearance. But as to whether that film will be as intense as Matrix Reloaded is another question... <br />This one doesn't measure up to the intensity of Matrix Reloaded, which means that for the most part, it's safe fare for the kiddies, despite the 'R' rating. The rating, I suspect is mostly for violence - nudity is limited to backsides and some frontal glimpses at the very beginning - something that can easily be explained to the younger generation and would draw no more than PG or PG-13. While body counts run high, blood and gore is quite limited in comparison to slasher films.<br />If you liked the previous two films, I suspect you won't be overly disappointed with this installment, particularly if you think the story is more important than the FX!
B00005JM09|1.0|Taking one of the great science fiction sagas and making it into a high budget let down is the story of T3.  This installment does not take into account the first two movies deciding instead to rewrite and worsen a good story.  I left scratching my head and wondering how such a promising franchise could be such a let down.  I honestly think anyone who was a fan of the first two movies will enjoy the special effects but be left dumbfounded by the story.  In the end T3 attempts to change the message and the intent of the previous films but leaves a dull plot with a weak message.  My advice is skip this one and hope another Terminator film is made to repair the tarnished image of the franchise.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Of all the films and television programs produced by airborne members of the Flying Circus, I consider this to be their greatest achievement. Co-authored and then co-directed Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (two rather silly people indeed), this film makes at least some effort to recreate a distant period in history and from a somewhat 20th century perspective. Apparently available funds were limited because Gilliam and Junes could not afford to rent horses and thus were forced to simulate them with body language and coconut half shells. Also, various members of the Ye Olde Merrie Companie were required to play several different roles...on occasion at the same time. For example, Graham Chapman as King Arthur as well as (or as unwell as) the Three-Headed Knight and the Hiccoughing Guard. Eric Idle ia also actively involved as Sir Robin, Maynard, Roger, a Guard, and the Historian Who Isn't A.J.P. Taylor...plus some other stuff my limited space precludes noting. One of Gilliam and Jones's cleverest strategies is to juxtapose 6th century Breton with 20th century England. Actually, not only juxtapose them but to have the former and latter interact without prior warning. Yes, this creates some confusion but the plot lags on fewer occasions and younger persons in the audience will feel more at home.<br />According to various historical sources, there was not one Arthur but hundreds...perhaps thousands in 6th century England. Indeed, here in Dallas in the year 2003, there are thousands of Arthurs now living in the North Texas region. How many kings? Ooodles of Kings but no kings; however, back then (i.e. 6th century), there were quite a few.<br />According to generally reliable research sources, for example, Geoffrey of Monmouth (about 1100-1155 A.D.) recorded Arthur as a High-King of Britain. He was the son of his predecessor, Uther Pendragon and nephew of King Ambrosius. As a descendant of High-King Eudaf Hen's nephew, Conan Meriadoc, Arthur's grandfather, had crossed the Channel from Brittany and established the dynasty at the beginning of the 5th century. The Breton King Aldrien had been asked to rescue Britain from the turmoil in which it found itself after the Roman administration had departed. He sent his brother, Constantine, to help. Constantine appears to have been the historical self-proclaimed British Emperor who took the last Roman troops from Britain in a vain attempt to assert his claims on the Continent in 407. Chronologically speaking, it is just possible he was King Arthur's grandfather. Arthur's Breton Ancestry was recorded by Gallet.<br />Of course, historical material such as this brought tears of joy to the eyes of both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (also their parents). They were inspired by it to bring the story of King Arthur and the Holy Grail to the sometimes silver screen. This they have done. Truly, the Pendragons are the stuff of legend. Predictably, Gilliam and Jones took certain liberties to achieve enhanced dramatic effect, adding some important new information revealed by their own historical research. For example, details about martial arts for quadriplegics, the Sepulcher of the Holy Grenade and its Killer Rabbit, aerodynamics of various species of migrating swallows, and interior decorating (e.g. curtains) in 6th century royal quarters. Exciting new stuff indeed.<br />Who said in 1974 that \\"They just don't make great movies anymore\\"? Well, whoever said that could not be more wrong.<br />For proof, they are herewith directed to the abundance of materials which are available only with the DVD version of this film. If they are still not convinced, I fart in their general direction.Channel from Brittany and established the dynasty at the beginning of the 5th century.

B00005JM09|4.0|The first TERMINATOR was all about story.  Watching a film like that is a rare treat due to a tight, complex, action packed storyline that relied on plot twists and stylish thrills to entertain.  I heard CAMERON originally wanted the movie to have the T-1000 as the antagonist but the budget would't allow it and the fx had, of course, not been developed yet.  Still the best and most somber of the series, the first film is the coolest independant sci-fi movie I've seen. <BR>     T2 was the groundbreaker.  Never before had I left the theater as blown away by the sheer size of a film.  With a compelling story still intact, the fx were nothing short of jaw-droppingly super-cool.  Set the bar really, really high on what summer movie watching was all about.  Probably the best summertime extavaganza since the original STAR WARS.  The action in this flick is top-notch and better that most released today, over ten years later.  A motion picture that truly defines and redefines the term blockbuster.<BR>     TERMINATOR 3-RISE OF THE MACHINES is the popcorn movie.  With some of the melancholy of the first film and some excellent set pieces of unadulterated mayhem, this entry in the series is just plain fun.  Upon first hearing about this release I had to groan because I belived everything had been covered in the other installments.  The script is just right with quick, snappy expainations and narrative.  The true treat of the film is watching ARNOLD ham it up (which I thought would've gotten old by now but still works somehow) and the exhillarating chases and action.  Avoiding the occasional cheesy line is impossible, but all and all a fine entry in a great franchise.  A matinee sci-fi/action flick with all the thrills and chills needed for a good time.<BR>     Due to the erie conclusion of the third picture maybe the creators will actually make, what I've thought all along would be cool, an HBO mini-series about the future war events leading up to the victory of the humans andthe destuction of the time-travelling device.  Could just be wishful thinking but I'd hate to see the end of an exciting series like THE TERMINATOR.
B000022TSW|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie on its premier on Comedy Central from 1am to 3am (though the commercial breaks I could have done without, but whatever, no big deal). A lot of people might complain about the insane level of swearing, but I don't see what the big deal is, since they are just words and nothing more. Not really offensive as far as I am concerned. And it can be funny at times, and at least they didn't bleep it out--that's really stupid.<br />The only thing that really bugged me about this movie was that they had to make it a musical. I don't like musicals and think they are lame. While some of the songs are funny, the fact that they broke out in a song every ten minutes or less in the movie was absolutely corny, and the movie could have been a lot better without the musical elements.<br />I did like all of the satire through the movie, which is definitely topnotch. For one thing, it was hillarious to see Satan's sensitive side. As for Sadamm Hussein, well, he's still a real jerk...not that I supported the war in Iraq, but he's still an evil man, no doubt.<br />The plot was thin, but still done adequately. The boys--Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into the R-rated Terrence and Philip movie, and then start swearing up a storm afterward, and because of that, their parents, rather than being responsible parents and trying to raise the kids, instead blame Terrence and Philip, and Canada as well, thus resulting in the onset of World War III with Canada. This is obviously an exaggeration to the problem of many parents not taking responsibility themselves for what their kids do, but don't forget that this is satire, and regardless of how exaggerated, it still makes many excellent political statements.<br />Yes, the entire movie is way over-the-top, but so is every single episode of the South Park series, and like the show, the movie is over-the-top in an intelligent fashion, and that's what makes it so hillarious. South Park might seem perverted, obscene, andjuvenile; however, among the vulgar obsenities and perversions and juvenile antics there are hidden meanings and social commentary through it all, which if one were to read between the lines and look carefully, they would notice it and catch the drift of the message the creators are trying to get across. And once you are able to do this, you will find that through all the insanity, there is indeed substance as well.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of the best interpretations of Pride and Prejucice.  Everything about it is wonderful - the acting, the sets and costumes, the attention to historical accuracy.  And then there's Colin Firth.  He's reason alone to buy the set.  I recommend it highly.
B00005JM09|5.0|To be honest my expectations were not high when I went to see T3. What initially bothered me was the absence of James Cameron, and Arnold's age (it's been more than 10 years since T2).<br />When the movie began, it was obvious right from the start that this was not going to be a flop. For one thing, the animation/graphics are incredible. The machines look incredibly realistic, and unlike most new movies where things are obviously computer generated, I was unable to differentiate from live film and computer generated elements. The special effects were superb.<br />As for the plot, there are some subtle hints to the first two films, and some really incredible plot twists that screw with your head. The actors are great; Schwarzenegger and Loken are perfect and stick their roles. I think Nick Stahl was a great choice for John Connor; a lot of people have complained but it makes the movie far more realistic having him portrayed as an ordinary man who leads a tormented lifestyle rather than a macho super-human without any worries. <br />Basically this movie had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. Put your doubts aside, see the movie and give it a chance. It's the kind of movie that has you talking when you leave, begging for more and trying to fit everything together. I think you will be thoroughly pleased.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have never seen an Japanese cartoon movie before until this.  I think this movie was excellant and whoever wrote it has a wild imagination.  I thought the movie kept your attention and makes you want to watch it over and over!
B000069HK2|2.0|The Used got together in Utah, recorded some music, and sent their demo to the band Goldfinger - now they are on MTV while band members are enjoying press time for getting arrested in Florida, and (until recently) corrupting Kelly Osbourne.  They are a pop-culture novelty, from the same vein as Good Charlotte.  This is the record industry taking trying to capitalize on a mostly underground musical movement of hardcore/emo and spoon-feeding it to you through these tools.  The music is cheesy, at best, and, while I'd rather listen to this than Good Charlotte or New Found Glory, that doesn't mean that The Used have any more integrity as a band.  If you want to hear music of this genre made by real bands who don't care about getting face time in magazines or on TV, go elsewhere.  Check out Full Collapse by Thursday, or Too Bad You're Beautiful by From Autumn to Ashes.
B00006LI4S|4.0|I was a little hesitant on buying this dvd until I popped the dvd in and listened to it the first time.  When I heard &quot;Shine on you Crazy diamond&quot; I was almost sadened by what I was hearing.  I thought you gotta be crazy David, doing this to a Pink Floyd song but after you get past the first couple songs the album truely opens up.  I personally start the dvd on the 4th track and the next 5 songs are pure bliss.  Also, David uses the acoustic guitar on all the songs but does use an electric guitar as well for many of his solos (in which he just jams out as you would expect him to).  At first I thought this was going to be a major disappointment but there are about 5 or 6 excellent songs on here which make it well worth the money.  I bought this DVD 4 days ago and have already listened to it about 8 or 9 times.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an awesome album.   I'm not what you would call a connosieur (sp?) of gothic rock, but it seems to me that this album fits under that label.   I'm completely in love with the brilliant Amy Lee, who is not only gothically gorgeous but also has one of the most brilliant voices I've ever heard.   My favorite songs are GOING UNDER, BRING ME TO LIFE, and MY IMMORTAL, but they are all brilliant.   Go out and buy it immediately!   That is an order!
B000001Y5X|5.0|i first heard this album when i was 13(6 years ago),and it blew me away, i was in love with it,it is still been one of my top favorite cds that i own, i also love the videos and shirts from this album,but ever since holy wood i havn't really been into his newer stuff,this cd is a classic,it's kinda strange to think that it's been out for almost ten years,even though i really do love this album, i still think manson will never compare to the ultimate shock rocker GG Allin
B000002UAF|5.0|After two number 1 albums one might think the boys would rest on there laurels a bit, indeed in 1964 it might have been expected from pop artists.  The Beatles third album (not really a soundtrack as only seven cuts are in the movie), not only finds the Beatles unwilling to stand still but instead make great leaps in the process.  The credit should probably go to John Lennon who wrote and sung the bulk of the songs, thus giving the project a tougher feel than their previous works.  The title track \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" opens the album in fine fashion.  Who doesn't know the song when that initial chord is played?  The song just thunders along relentlessly matching the theme of the lyrics perfectly.  \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" comes next and although it has a nice melody it is not one of the stand out songs on this disc.  \\"If I Fell\\" is a brilliant song.  Great harmonies, great feeling in the song.  \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\\" is an underrated Harrison sung gem.  Its tough chord-driven backing belies the semi-soppy lyrics.  \\"And I Love Her\\" is the first time we hear McCartney.  It's a very good song but its really Harrison who shines with his Spanish guitar type solo.  \\"Tell Me Why\\" Is really one of the weaker songs on the disc with the boys singing some really, really high harmonies on it.  \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is Paul's rocker on the disc.  Like John's \\"Hard Day's Night\\" the sheer energy propels the song forward.  George's solo in this song also shows him advancing as a guitarist, taking it up a notch from what he's done before.  \\"Any Time At All\\" is John making it happen.  His singing (unmatched in rock), can take a ordinary song like this and make it a cut above.  \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" is kind of countryish but with such a good tune and good singing the Beatles pull it off.  \\"Things We Said Today\\" has Paul starting off with an acoustic song but he starts rocking in the middle.  \\"When I Get Home\\" is probably a little harder than the Beatles fans were used to but its great.  It just doesn't let up especially where the rhythm guitars mimick the snare drum fill late in the song.  Lennon outdoes himself.  \\"You Can't Do That\\" is up next, with Lennon himself taking the bulk of the guitar work in this song.  Despite the usual girl-letting-me down lyrics, the backing is phenomenal.  \\"I'll Be Back\\" closes this fine disc.  Although there are better songs to close the set, this'll do.  Besides the harmonies, its pretty unmemorable.  The Beatles sound continued to improve with this record.  The clarity of the guitars were sharper on this record than their previous two making the sound that much fuller as they are mixed so up front.  This would be the only album in the Beatles storied history that would just have Lennon and McCartney compositions on it.t its great.

B00005QDW1|5.0|I love this album. It has been criticized for its simplistic and popish lyrics, but this is amazing pop/rock music, some of the best released in years. It garnered 3 number 1 Hits and a Grammy. It is a drastic change from Return of Saturn and Tragic Kingdom forsure. The band in all its pre release media made it clear that this Album was going to be fun and  simple. And they suceeded with flying colors. Its great pop music. The album also has alot more to offer then just those fun/simple tunes,It also has a few great rock tunes( produced by the amazing Ric Ocasek) , an amazing dark new wave song called Detective that could fit on Return of Saturn LP, Hella Good is an awesome hardhiting dance song that has alot of rock elements to it(produced by Neptunes) and finally a great duet with Prince himself (Waiting room). Giving it 2 stars just because its different then there rock/ska backgrounds is foolish. The band sought to try something radical and new, while returning to creating fun music compared to the depressing but classic Return of Saturn CD. It is an amazing pop record with rock, regge and new wave undertones. This is what Pop music should be, not the trashy, bubble gum pop in recent years.
0671024256|5.0|I should first start by saying, \\"I'm not a fan of Stephen King.\\" He is a great author but I'm not into horror tales. I bought this book to learn about writing. At first I was very unimpressed; I thought he was going to ramble about his life through the whole book. Boy was I wrong.<br />This is one of the great books on writing. Mr. King not only gives great advice to the reader but he enriches and motivates the writing soul. If you want to write, you really should buy this book. If you don't want to write but you just want to understand the life of a fiction writer, this is a great book for you.<br />In one section Mr. King notes this was his first non-fiction book. He relates many problems he had completing this book. I just want to say, \\"Mr. King by sticking it out, you have completed one of the best books on writing.\\" Thank You!
B000002LMM|3.0|I LOVE Twin Peaks, but there are so many songs missing from this soundtrack, that it upsets me.  Why do I need to hear 3 different orchestrations of Audrey's theme?  And why are both Rock Back Inside My Heart and As The World Spins are left out?  These songs are, in my opinion, two of the best songs from the series.  I still listen to this cd a lot, but when it gets time for the last 3 songs (All previously represented on the cd), it's a rare time when I do not end my listening session right there.
B00005JM09|4.0|Despite the lack of Linda Hamilton and James Cameron, this Terminator does more than a respectable job at continuing the franchise with wit, action and imagination.  For all of us Terminator fans, this could have been a disaster.  The action sequences are absolutely astounding, and the new Terminatrix is vicious and terrifying. Nick Stahl is a vast improvement over Edward Furlong in the last film, and Arnold's presence is actually fun.  It's a big popcorn epic, not too long, and actually thought-provoking -- which is a requirement of all Terminator movies!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwood Mac truly shines in this album. Despite Christie McVie's presence the band still sounds great. Among the songs that I think really do shine in this album are Say You Will and Peacekeeper. Lindsey Buckingham plays an amazing guitar part in the ending of 'Come'. Although the band takes on a new sound in many of these songs Say You Will is an excellent album and definitely worth buying.
B00005JM09|5.0|...So while I had to see the film I really expected it to be an exercise in \\"cashin' in\\" by the production company, Arnold, et al.  WRONG!!  They did a great job at weaving together an interesting story with a plausible explanation as to why there was a story here to be told.<br />This movie is not \\"GREAT\\" in the context of being filled with original ideas.  However, it tells a new story in a fresh and original way.  Plus, it opens the door for some interesting story ideas for the future and a new direction for possible story continuations to go into.  I did not see this film so much as a sequel, rather, I saw it as a pivotal film upon which the saga can turn and go into a different direction of storytelling; assuming the financing and interest is there.  I gave this film 5 stars because it surprised me and it was not predictable.  The action scenes were fun and the story compelling and when the end arrived I had to admit that I simply did not see it coming.
B00005JM09|5.0|This was a great movie....<br />No it it wasn't T2 and it wasn't the Terminator..<br />okay, No cameron<br />No Hamilton<br />No Furlong...<br />But you really don't need them..<br />The story is very strong a bit quick but very strong...<br />The action is amazing and the special effects are great.<br />The girl who played the TX was really good you get used to her trust me.<br />John Connor also..<br />Arnold is in top form.. Don't dismiss this movie and don't listen to people when they say it's bad see it for yourself...
B00003CXRM|4.0|If you're thinking about buying this DVD, you should know:<br />1. It is in an &quot;anamorphic widescreen&quot; (2.35-1) format. This is that skinny format that cuts off about 25% of the screen at the top and 25% at the bottom. Unlike other DVDs, there is no other option. VHS appears to be the only alternative.<br />2. Buena Vista (Disney) decided to include previews of three of their turkeys that load automatically at the beginning. You can avoid them by pressing the Menu button on your remote during a 3-second pause.<br />Otherwise it's a great film.
B00005JKN9|2.0|The story and setting had enormous potential but the casting left a lot to be desired. DeCaprio looks too much like a boy to play the role of a tough guy raised in a 19th century reformatory; poor dental hygiene aside, Oliver Twist maybe, Amsterdam Vallon never. Not enough Liam Neeson in the movie and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Bill Cutting was a little over the top. His character seemed better suited to the role of villain in a Batman movie.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I just watched the Frida movie and it was great. But what was even greater was the music. <br />I painted all day today listening to it on constant rotation. The songs seem to flow together almost like an opera.  It is at times soulful, energetic, sad and passionate. <br />I even got up and danced a little. For this slow slug - that is high praise.
B000002TPS|5.0|Megadeth have always been a great band, but they had sufferred at times from inconsistency in an album.  &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; is the only other album of theirs which is as consistent as &quot;Youthanasia&quot;.  Mustaine's singing on this is the most coherant he's ever been and the lyrics address interesting issues.  More progressive than usual and the solos are incredible - even for Megadeth, they're incredible!  Tracks 5,6 and 7 are the slowest period of the album, but they're still not bad.  At other times, you will be blown away by this melodical metal.  In tradition speed metal fashion, the first and last tracks are the most frantic.  &quot;Toute la monde&quot; is my favourite
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am old enough to have experienced musicals from \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"West Side Story\\" and others the first time around. I too watched the new musical, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" with great expectation and had only disappointment. <br />Chicago was WONDERFUL!!!! It was creative, sassy, fun and tounge-in-cheek. I loved the play on words and the exciting dance routines. I can't stop playing the soundtrack in my home, in my car or at work. I also can't wait for the release of the DVD so I can enjoy it over and over again.
B00008DDRX|5.0|For anyone who went to the Sarthe circuit for the Le Mans 24 hour in the 1970s this is the film that captures it all, far better than any home video ever could. The cars are the stars, the PA system with its irregular English update provides the commentary, and the drivers are the hired bit players.<br />Anyone who bags this film does not understand the tension and drama of most dangerous motor race in the world, and shouldn't be reviewing the film. Most dangerous motor race in the world? Nudging 400 kph at night in a rainstorm is dangerous!<br />The dialogue is sparse, and so it should be: the racing engine whose deep bellow rises to a crescendo, the tortured tyres that screech at every misguided change in direction and the chilling sound of shattering fibreglass, perspex and composite alloys tell the viewer what is really happening.<br />How real is this film?  The camera car, which is seen in at least one scene entering the pit straight, came ninth outright. One of the drivers lost his leg during a practice shunt that is caught on film. There are fudges in the filming; note when MacQueen destoys his car the back wheels are still spinning long after the Porsche has bounced off a few armco fences. The accelerator was wedged open to prolong the crash.<br />Steve MacQueen's legacy to the motor racing enthusiast is one of the purest films made.
B00006879E|3.0|Like so many others, I bought the album after hearing Harder to Breathe a few times.  In brief, if you've heard HTB, the you've heard about a third of the songs.  If you've heard anything by Evan and Jaron, Nine Days, or any other bubblegum rock band of the early 2000's you've heard another third of their songs.<br />The last third (mostly in the later parts of the disc) is where the good stuff is. Sunday Morning woke me up from daydreaming with its cool bleusy piano and slow groove.  Secret starts as a tonal experiment, and continues to intrigue... strongest song lyrically.  Not Coming Home and Sweetest Goodbye both start out with average verses, but have tight refrains which really got into my head.<br />My chief complaints about this album are: very little expressiveness, repetetive guitar rhythms, cliche lyrics, lead singer's grating voice, and an overall lack of emotion (something which I usually don't notice in groups until its all too obvious)
B000002H97|5.0|The Black Album is one of two things to people: Metallica's greatest achievment, or a sellout.  For me, it is much closer to the former.  Master and Justice were both good albums, but Metallica needed to change their approach and on this album it worked.  This album consists of 12 very strong tracks.  Enter Sandman became a modern day classic.  One of my personal favorites from this album would be The Unforgiven.  The musical arrangements as well as the lyrics touched something inside me every time I listen to it.  My final verdict is this is a masterpiece and it definitely deserves its place on VH1's Ultimate Albums.
B00008RH3L|5.0|There are hundreds of carbon copied gangster movies of the forties, sixties and seventies.  Few gangster films fall into the category of great movies.  Most bore you to death within the first half hour which is not the case with Millers Crossing.  <BR>The Coen brothers are one of the elite duos in film. Millers Crossing left me wanting more. The story was hard to follow at times.  I will need to watch it again to completely understand the story line. Recently I watched Road to Perdition. If you liked that film and haven't seen Millers Crossing please do immediately. Everything about this film is perfectly done. At times the gangsters take on the comic book imager not depicted in other movies.  The DVD was very good. Watch the special features section interview with Barry Sonnenfeld.  He has some great insight on the many films him and the Coen brothers have made.  I recommend this movie and that everybody who loves films take one week and watch all the Coen Brothers films.  My week has been truly enjoyable.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is absolutely the best piece U2 ever made. Every song is 5 stars worth (or 6 stars). If you listen to it more than 5 times you must love it. Even the vocals in ZOO Station. <BR>I call this album best of nonbest of becouse every song is a pearl and I think the album is even better than U2's Best of.
6300216802|1.0|This is BY FAR the worst thing to come out under the Star Trek name - and I'm counting the cheesy original show! This movie went far too long with far too little reason to. The effects may have been cool in the 70's, but they aren't now. Even that would be fine if there was some interesting plot to back it up, but there isn't.  With maybe one funny part in the whole movie (which is bad for a usually pretty funny series), this needs to be put on display in a museum, not rented out for home use. You have far better things to do with your time. If you want some good Star Trek, check out 'Wrath of Khan', 'Voyage Home', &quot;Undiscovered Country', or 'Genesis'. The new ones are good too - especially 'Insurrection'.
B00003Q08R|1.0|First off, let me tell you that I am a huge Paul McCartney/Beatles fan, and have been since I was a kid. And I just have to say that I was so disappointed with this album that it isnt even funny. Dont get me wrong, Paul McCartney is remarkably talented, and an astonishingly brilliant musician. The problem with this album is that Paul got worried that his style of music might not fit in with the 80's as well as it did with the 70's style. So he tried the old \\"completely change your style in an effort to save you[]from losing the crowd\\" trick, and it bombed, bad! Paul's efforts to change his style into the new 80's techno-sound was a really bad idea. And what the hell was with the song \\"Temporary Secretary\\". I mean that was just sad...If I had been playing that song on a record the first time I heard it, I would've guessed it to be skipping. The only kinda good song on this album is \\"Coming Up\\", but even thats just simply \\"ok\\", nothing special..... Take my advise and dont buy this album for any other reason than to simply laugh at it. Its not worth the money, and from such an amazing artist, its a major disappointment, especially if you are a fan, you'll be really bummed. Buy the original \\"McCartney\\" album, \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Tug of War\\" or \\"Flaming Pie\\", in my opinion they are definitely McCartney's best albums yet, they are awesome!!!
6304415346|4.0|I like Star Trek, and I'm not ashamed to admit it!  This was a great movie - I love Patrick Stewart, and this got really in depth about the Borg (Who are downright scary). I also liked Levarr Burton (I was a Reading Rainbow child).  This was overall a very good Science Fiction, with some humor (Provided mostly by Data), and lots of thrills.

B000002JPA|5.0|Absolutely the best song ever is &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot;. It is so succint, beautiful, haunting... I can never get that piano out of my head. The rest of the CD doesn't compare, but is still highly above average.  I really like &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, I love &quot;Surrounded&quot;, and, of course, &quot;Metropolis-Part I&quot;. I'm not even into heavy rock, but it was Pettruci's amazing, striking voice that did it for me.  Dream Theater's sound is truly uniqe and incredible, and I love all thier CD's.  This just happens to be the best.
0385043805|5.0|Does anyone need a review of this classic .... It is the best description of human emotions set under mysterious surroundings ...
0451450523|5.0|Beagle's dreamy prose would be reason enough to read this fantastic fantasy novel, but the interesting plot, memorable characters, and subtle underlying plot about the need for truth and justice in the world is one that every reader will take with them to the end of thier lives. The major characters (the beautiful unicorn who becomes Amalthea, failed magician Shmendrick, and jaded scullery maid Molly Grue) are all very real, relatable characters, and not the ones you'd find in a typical fantasy. Lir is likable and realistic as the &quot;Hero&quot;, minor characters such as the cat and the spider are lovable, and even the villains (the people of Hagsgate, Haggard, and Mommy Fortuna) are not typical villains. Beagle makes his novel so memorable, perhaps because instead of relating to the perfect heroine, the reader relates more to Molly Grue, or Shmendrick, or even Haggard.  The Bull and the Unicorn are symbols - it is the human characters of this book that make it what it is. The ending of this novel is perfect - it left me in tears, and I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad. I could rant and rave about the splendor and beauty of this novel forever, but it wouldn't make any difference.  Peter S. Beagle's novel &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; is perhaps the best book ever written, certainly the best fantasy novel, and I give it the highest reccomendation I can possibly give.  Get it now!
B00008VGL6|5.0|Martin Gore's second solo effort, definitely needs several listens to get through it (as well as the first one, I may add). Not only the songs selection, but the arrangements are dark, very Counterfeit Ep's &quot;Smile In The Crowd&quot; like. But once it gets through you, you will enjoy it a lot - but give it the time it needs to do so. It's weird to hear Martin's voice surrounded by almost trip-hoppy ambience, but it certainly is refreshing. I wouldn't recommend this album for the casual listener, but Depeche Mode fans (as me), would be thrilled listening the mastermind behind, having fun at the studio arranging some of his favourite songs (I suppose they are so) into a more synth-trip-hop (and, obviously, Depeche Modish) driven form. Highly recommendable for those DM fans who weren't satisfied with Exciter. Dave Gahan's Paper Monsters is even better!!
630242335X|4.0|This film was different from the usual Star Treks, mainly due to a plot shift away from the usual action to a more sophisticated, mental plot.  That is not to say that 'Undiscovered Country' had any less action, but the focus of the movie was more on accepting differences, \\"burying the hatchet\\", so to speak. This manifests itself in several subplots, including the murder of Klingon officials.  I'm not quite sure if I prefer this mental plot to a more concrete one, such as 'Voyage Home', but I do know that Star Trek has always been on the cutting edge of creativity and special effects, and this movie is no exception. 'Undiscovered Country' is definitely worth the money.
B00000JGEI|5.0|Terimnator 2 exceeded the expectations after the acclaimed Terminator.  James Cameron is a great filmmaker and should make more movies than he has.  Arnold gives his usual performance but Linda Hamilton really stood out along with a young Edward Furlong.<br />the plot:  John Connor is now a young boy and is in grave danger of a new terminator sent to destroy him before he becomes the leader in the future.  John Connor (in the future) sends another model of the 1st terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect john from the new terminator (Robert Patrick).  This is all happening while Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in a mental institution after the Skynet Software company covered up the 1st battle of the terminator.  She was sent there as insane because she believed what Reese (The Terminator) told her about John and the future and the terminators.<br />While escaping the mental asylum John is being chased (in a remarkable chase scene..almost as good as The Matrix Reloaded) after by Robert Patrick.  Arnold comes to save the day and they make it out safely.  the terminator and john go to group up with Sarah.  After they're together The Terminator explains why he came to protect John and also explains what judgement day is...(Andrew Dison recieved the terminator hand from the cover up of the mess in their hydrogen plant...therefore he is destined to make the terminators that will destroy the human race...with a chip and the hand.) Sarah tells them what to do.  Obviously she planned ahead for Judgement day and stored guns underground where her spanish buddy Enrique lived and were.  Sarah has a dream of Judgement Day and acts quickly.  She decides that she'll change the future of the terminators by killing Dison but she has a change of heart before she kills him.  The Terminator and John show up and lay down the whole thing in front of Dison.  That he would be responsible for 3 billion deaths in the future.  So they decide to destroy everything that would make a terminator.  The chip, the hand, his house, and most importantly the Skynet Company.  From there the action takes off.<br />James Cameron has made a fantastic movie.  Overall I think it's better than the 1st one.  The version i saw was on Tv but i plan on buying the T2 Extreme DVD.  Excellent Sci-Fi movie.  Arnold's best.
6300214400|3.0|I'm not a Kirstie Alley fan, but I thought that 'Search for Spock' was a decent follow up to 'Wrath of Khan' (Which had me in tears the first time I watched it - I was eleven).  A few of the parts were sort of slow (like when the planet is breaking up), but overall I thought that 'Search for Spock' was an acceptable film, if only to find out what exactly happened to Spock after 'Wrath of Khan'.  Worth a rent.
B00005JLEU|1.0|A lot of you have been calling this an anime title.  It is, but it isn't.  I think Disney realized how popular anime was getting here in the States, and decided to try to make some cash off of it by putting their name on the product.<br />DO NOT USE THIS MOVIE AS A JUDGEMENT FOR OTHER ANIME!<br />Traditional anime, produced by companies like ADV Films, Pioneer, Bandai, and Anime Works (Which I'm doubting any of you have heard of if you consider SA to be \\"great anime.\\"), is what you really should be looking for if you want to try anime.<br />There are great anime titles out there, for all ages... if your kids really want to watch anime, there's Pokemon and the like.  But parents turning into pigs and a vomiting... thing... is really more suitable for kids a little older than what this movie was targeted at.<br />But since I doubt any of you care... then by all means, watch it.  It's your loss.
6302453356|4.0|People can't seem to agree on how this movie is rated.  Unfortunately, it might be a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; thing, in which case reviews are meaningless. I will go ahead and say that I LOVED this movie as a child (well, preteen), and all of my friends did too. I actually liked the Lost Boys, especially Rufio, whose whole character I found very interesting. I didn't like the skateboard bits, but if I were a little boy, I might.I absolutely LOVED Hoffman as Hook - he was funny and sinister all at the same time (&quot;I'm going to do it, and don't try to stop me. Smee, don't you dare try to stop me, Smee, try to stop me.  Smee!  Try to stop me, I'm commiting suicide here!&quot;).  Robing Williams is excellent as always, and Pan's children do a fantastic job. I really empathized with the little girl when I was little.  There are a few flaws (I didn't like Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, actually), but overall this movie is definitely worth a rent. Good for the young and the young-at-heart (sorry for the corny line!), I highly recommend it.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is Ageless! This CD has been a Hit since its Release back in Early April! One of My all time favorites is SONG FOR THE LONELY! Listen to it and close your eyes and you will no why! <br />If you know of anyone who needs a Birthday or Gift of any kind this CD makes a Great gift cuz the person who get it will not stop listening to it!
B00007K08H|5.0|I rented this movie with very low expectations (mainly because of the types of people who recommended it to me), and was completely blown away, at times actually falling off the sofa laughing. The garden gnome incident is priceless! I would place this more in the comedy than the romance department, though I almsot cried when little Amelie lost her fish. I thought the actress who played Amelie was a little creepy, but perfect for the role.  The plot was fresh and hysterically funny, and one of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't try too hard. The humor and romance (and sorrow) are all served up so naturally that you barely have time to catch your breath and wipe your eyes before something else is making you crack up. This movie was truly heartwarming, especially the incident with the spinster widow downstairs, whose husband left her. Once or twice the subtitles ran too fast for me to catch up, and I thought the nudity and sex (little though it was) was unecessary.  It still didn't detract at all from this suprising and hilarious little French import.  Well done!
B000083E79|5.0|Cher definetely deserves actually 6 stars! Unfortunately we only have five hare to give her. Her Fare well CD is absolutley fantastic! If you do not own a Cher CD, this is the one to purchase as it has some awesome songs on it. All of my favorites actually. Cher is like the Female Elvis she continues to be on the tops in charts and in ratings! Purchase Cher &amp; lets make her number 1 with this final album!<br />Cher Rocks! John Chicago
B00008S7ZW|3.0|I don't know if I just missed it between the rather disgusting sex scenes, but I didn't catch the theme of this story. I really liked the acting - Jake Gylenhaal is proving himself to be a big new talent, Jennifer Aniston was great as always, and John C. Riley turned up a fantastic supporting role with next to nothing script-wise. However, I didn't really get if this was supposed to be a movie about corruption or redemption. The whole beginning of the movie seems to suggest the former, but the ending doesn't fit with that. In the end, Justine's voice over (which may have been the best part of the movie)declared that she had two choices to make. It was never really clarified why she made the one she did. In any case, the plot of this movie would have led to two or even one star (the many times lackluster dialogue and unclear theme were a little too much for me), the great acting turned in by Gylenhaal (Who was intense and a little creepy), Riley (who turned his dope addicted character into a very sympathetic one), and, yes, Aniston (who did a very good job, but not great) brought this movie up out of the gutter to give it three stars. For all the hype, 'The Good Girl' wasn't really very good. If you want to see Gylenhall, Aniston, and Riley in separate, good movies, try 'Donnie Darko', 'The Object of My Affection', or 'Chicago'. 'The Good Girl' tries to be deep, but it only scrapes the surface. Worth a rent, but don't waste your money on the tape.
0316666343|1.0|A middle that sagged under repetitious near-appearances of the narrative ghost propped up by a first person rape account at one end and a trite redemption at the other. Look elsewhere for a satisfying read.
6300213803|4.0|For being so many people's favorite Star Trek, I don't see what all the fuss is about. 'Wrath of Khan' is INFINITELY better than the original movie, and it's very neat how they took a TV show plot and turned it into a film. Overall, this is an above-average movie, with some excitement, some twists and turns, and a very surprising and sad end. Khan does a great job acting (Though the open vest suit leaves a little to be desired...). 'Wrath of Khan' is definitely a classic Sci-Fi movie.
0151008116|5.0|In my opinion, Life of Pi is a masterpiece. It brought me to tears, filled me with joy and petrified me. Martel's writing pulls you into the story and makes you feel as though you are Pi and you're trying desparately to survive this nightmare. <br />The book is thought provoking and by far the best adventure I've read in a long time.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is a great CD, combining smooth R&amp;B with a few power ballads. The only low points are 'Looking In', which is obviously very emotional, but a little too slow for my liking, and 'Fantasy Interlude', which I skip.  Personal favorites include 'Melt Away' (Who doesn't empathize with that melting feeling?), 'Underneath the Stars'(Sweet up-tempo ballad that is tons of fun to sing), 'One Sweet Day' (Very emotional and lovely), and 'Fantasy' (Great dance track).  Overall, this CD best showcases Mariah's incredible talent.
B00001OH7X|5.0|Like most of the reviewers here, I always avoided this album. However I put it on again a few weeks ago to try it again, and I haven't been able to take it off. This album is outstanding and shows an artist at the height of his powers.  Listen to the innovation here, these tunes are serious. To me this is the album that ended his run of great albums in the 70s. Try it again folks, and again and again !
B000060P79|5.0|Almost every single one of SP's songs are terribly depressing.<BR>It's obvious that lead singer Pierre has some issues with his family. The utterly depressing, tearjerking 'Perfect' is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard.  But the rest of the CD blares out happy-go-lucky guitar riffs, juvenile lyrics, and just plain fun. I've had the pleasure of meeting these talented guys, and that is really what they're all about. This is a great easy listening CD - it may not be earth-shaking or momentous, but it is just good clean fun. Favorites include 'My Alien', which is just a funny song about a rather odd girlfriend, 'God Must Hate Me', which I'm sure is something we all can relate to (luckily He doesn't!), and 'I'd Do Anything'. Pierre's vocals go nicely with the whiney pop-punk music of Seb, David, Jeff, and Chuck. These guys are great - see them in concert, they're even better.
0790733226|5.0|I really wasn't sure that Carl Sagan's novel would translate very well to the big screen; after all, Sagan and his book were grounded in science, some of the most hardware-intensive scenes were left rather vague in the novel, and Sagan's atheism threatened to somehow taint the story's interplay of science and religion.  This movie, though, despite the fact that it necessarily differs from Sagan's novel at times, works amazingly well, even resurrecting a powerful ending under conditions that could be criticized by some in the two words \\"nothing happens.\\"  Indeed, something amazing does happen, and even if it had not, one theme that I read into this story is that the journey is often more important than the destination.<br />This motion picture is (pardon the pun) stellar in so many ways, reflecting a rare level of commitment on the part of everyone involved.  This really starts with the cast.  The role of Dr. Ellie Arroway was a crucial one that, in the hands of the wrong actress, could have doomed the whole project.  Any concerns along these lines, though, were dispensed with immediately upon the signing of Jodie Foster, the greatest female actress of this generation.  Matthew McConaughey gives a better than average performance as Palmer Joss (the religious guy), Tom Skerritt is as unlikable as always in his role as the President's Science Advisor and frequent Arroway nemesis, and the rest of the cast excels as well.  The injection of then-President Clinton and a number of CNN journalists into a number of scenes also brings a most welcome feel of reality to the profound events taking place here.  The special effects are just wonderful.  The opening scene is as beautiful and memorable as any scene you will find anywhere, the animation of the giant machine is extremely realistic, and the visual aspects of space travel are also a sight to behold.  Not only do these great scenes delight the eyes, they remain true to the nuts and bolts of science that Sagan wanted in the movie.  This movie may be long by some standards, coming in at almost two and a half hours, but there's not one wasted scene.<br />The story is, in a sense, not all that complicated.  Ellie Arroway (Foster) finally gets a chance to realize her dream of searching for signals from outer space, only to find herself and her project stripped of funding by an unimaginative (or possibly secretive) government.  She and her colleagues refuse to let the dream die, and on one remarkable day they pick up a signal.  Once the signal is verified and word gets out, the public begins to wig out in a number of ways (quite overblown, in my opinion) and the government, specifically the military, swoops in to get their hands on the project.  Ironically, yet very plausibly, part of the signal ends up showing a clip of Hitler opening the Munich Olympic Games (which was the first television signal broadcast over a sizable area).  Arroway manages to persevere in her work, and eventually a message is discerned among the data, yielding blueprints for some type of great machine.  After plenty of government haggling, the machine is built, and one person is chosen to travel in what the scientists now come to believe is some type of interstellar craft.  The movie does not end here, though, not by a long shot.<br />I find a few aspects about this movie and Sagan's novel interesting on a personal level.  Sagan was a long-time exponent of the search for extraterrestrial life, yet at a certain point in his career, he noticeably changed and became one of the most unobjective bulwarks of the movement to discredit any and all UFO sightings and encounters; some have speculated that he became a participant in the official government policy of disinformation and dismissal.  I believe he would know better than most how the government would frown upon news as profound as the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and this movie certainly does show some of the dangers inherent in the military takeover of extraterrestrial projects.  I am also somewhat surprised at just how effective the juxtaposition of science and religion is presented here, given Sagan's lifelong atheism.  The religious aspect of the film works more in a spiritual than a Biblical sense, yet work it does.  There is obviously a lot of Sagan himself in Dr. Arroway, and this story, in both novel and motion picture form, stands as a true testament to one of the most influential scientists of modern times.tary takeover of extraterrestrial projects.

630018403X|5.0|As a person who just graduated High School, I have to say that this is the most realistic teen movie I have ever seen. These kids talk, look, and act like real teens.  The dialogue is brilliant, funny, and provacative. \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is a wise, witty, and quotable film that rips into the fundamentals of teen life - cliques, parents, and sex.  It does all this with a little innuendo and some foul language (mostly from Bender), but it is ten times cleaner than most teen movies nowadays.  It's respectful while being interesting, and is one of my top ten movies.<BR>One thing that impressed me is the way that this film stood up the test of time. These things were going on in the 80's, just as they're going on today.  This movie is great for middle to high schooler's, but I know my 40-year-old parents still enjoy it today.  It really bridges gaps.  But don't get me wrong - this movie is enjoyable and funny - any soul searching is purely voluntary. Get \\"The Breakfast Club\\", if only for a good laugh.
B00007BH5C|5.0|If you liked the first soundtrack, I would definitly recommend buying this.  It has the same theme, along with a new Rohan theme that is simply awesome.  I love how Howard Shore combines vocals with the orchestra--it sounds amazing!
630021463X|5.0|This is by far the best Star Trek to date.  It's hilariously funny (especially Spock), and really cute and creative too. It takes a serious thing, like whale poaching, and shows how important it could be to our futures. I also loved the ending.  This is a great movie in every sense of the word - it's funny, action-packed, and has a great moral.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you are looking for \\"dancing songs\\" and pop stuff, OK Computer is not going to help you. But if you love songs with lots of layers and rich sounds you will appreciate this cd.  I really wish people would stop blowing this cd off after the first listen, because if you give OK Computer a chance, even if it isn't your style of music, you will be pleasantly surprised.    *patience is a virtue hard to come by*
B0000028VT|4.0|Despite somewhat cheesy lyrics, Mariah pulls off this CD with grace and dignity.  While I don't like it quite as much as her first CD, this is a sweet CD that shows off her incredible voice.  I especially like 'Dreamlover', 'Music Box', 'Never Forget You', and 'I've been Thinking about You'.  Good effort.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The original Terminator movie became an instant classic action movie for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and director James Cameron. With T3 coming out, here's a review of that original movie.<br />First, you have to remember that in 1984 when this first came out, the whole gritty future-view a la Blade Runner (1982) was just taking hold. Along comes Terminator which melds that future-is-bleak theme with modern day action, and throw a muscle-man and tender-turned-tough woman into the mix. <br />I am a HUGE fan of this movie for many, many reasons. You have Linda Hamilton as a normal, every day woman who resists what is going on - and in the end finds her strength to go on. That transformation is just amazing. You have the love story between her and the 'normal man' who is sent back in time to try to defend her. And of course you have the 'machine' - Arnold - who single-mindedly works to track her down and destroy her.<br />There are just so many touches in the movie that show the care that James Cameron put into the film, making it truly the 'baby' of him, Arnold and Linda. This isn't your average action movie where the high bodycount and infinite ammo are key. It is a movie with a lot of thought, with well laid out backgrounds and the time changes between the &quot;current future&quot; of 2029 and the &quot;current present&quot; of 1984 show great connections.<br />Linda Hamilton in this was always a huge role model to me and many of my friends. She wasn't special. She didn't have ninja training or robotic eyeballs. But she saw what had to be done, and she gathered her strength and did it. <br />A great movie in its own right, and a must-see for anyone interested in T3!
B00005JM09|4.0|This is the newest film in the Terminator franchise.  The first two films were directed by James Cameron, but a new director has taken the reins for this one.  The director is Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown).  I was a little nervous going into this movie because of this change in the director.  James Cameron had made two classic, genre defining films that pushed the special effects teams to the limits (especially on Terminator 2).  Mostow had a lot to live up to and I wasn't confident that he could do the job.  I was wrong.  Mostow did not make a Terminator movie the way that James Cameron would have done, but he made a worthy entry into the Terminator franchise.<br />One thing to note about this movie is that it is not nearly as gritty (emotionally or in the content of the movie) as the first two Terminator movies (especially not as much as the first one).  While this uses the elements and story of the Terminator franchise, this is not a hard science fiction film but more of an action film.  It also works very well on this level.  Here is the back story that we know going into this movie: In the near future all of our lives will be run through computers.  Our military will use one great supercomputer to manage the military functions.  This computer will become self-aware and take control of the world through computers (which run everything).  There will be a war between man and machine and the machines will win.  Humans will be almost wiped from the face of the planet until there are only small pockets of resistance left.  One man will rise to lead the humans: John Connor.  In the first Terminator movie, the machines sent a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother.  John sent back a man who would become his father to protect Sarah Connor.  In the second Terminator movie, the machines sends back an advanced model to kill a 13 year old John Connor.  The model that was sent back to kill Sarah in the first movie was sent back in time to protect John in the second movie.  This brings us to the third Terminator movie.  John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's.  His mother has died of Leukemia and John is living on the fringes of society.  He lives in such a way that there is no record of his existence (he works on the theory that if he can't be found, he can't be killed).  He lives a gloomy existence because even though the judgement day in 1997 has come and past without incident, he doesn't really feel that it is over.  A new Terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken) has been sent back to kill both John Connor, but failing that to kill the men and women who will become his lieutenants in the resistance against the machines.<br />The T-X appears to be an updated version of the T-1000 that Robert Patrick played in Terminator 2.  The T-X is also made of the liquid metal that the T-1000 was, but there are added abilities.  One: the T-X has functional weapons built into it.  The T-X can turn its arm into a gun/flamethrower and various other weapons.  The other major upgrade is that the T-X can remotely control other machines.  This provides for a rather impressive chase sequence involving a van, cop cars, fire engines and one bulky vehicle with a crane.  The T-X was also designed to destroy other Terminators.  To protect John Connor, the Arnold model from the first two movies is sent back to protect John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who would become John's second in command.  The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenneger) is an outdated model but was the only one the resistance was able to capture and reprogram.<br />This is the set up for the movie.  Kate is the disbelieving woman that Sarah Connor was in the first movie, but there is great chemistry between John and Kate and this helps the movie a lot.<br />One thing that The Terminator tells John is that the Judgement Day has not been stopped, only delayed and that it is still coming...very soon.  As you can tell from the subtitle of the movie: Rise of the Machines, the machine uprising begins during this movie.  I mentioned that this movie didn't have the grit of the previous movies, and this is true, but it is not a very upbeat film and with the Machines beginning the war we are not given a very happy movie.  We are given a good one, though.  Terminator 3 is not perfect, but it far exceeded my expectations.he machine uprising begins during this movie.

0385504209|5.0|I almost quit reading the book after reading the first chapter - it started off slow - but given the reviews I stuck with it and LOVED it.<br />I read the book in one sitting, all the while researching the works of arts described. Here's a tip: find the web site for the Louvre and you will be richly rewarded with virtual tours of its galleries and detailed close ups of most of the paintings described. If ever a fiction book needed illustrations, this one does!<br />I have no doubt that this book can be made into a great movie along the lines of &quot;The Thomas Crowne Affair&quot;, which I also loved.<br />As to what is fact, and what is fiction, the author toys with us, making us second guess some of our firmest beliefs. Is what we have held as the truth all our lives just fiction? Or does this fictional book hold the key to the truth? In the end, Dan Brown proves to be the master of double-entendres.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I love this album - in fact, it's my favourite recent album. This guy has some talent. The songs are lovely, and moving. I have the import version, but I don't think there is any difference besides the outer cover being cloth on the import. This one is definitely worth buying - it will be a favourite of mine for a long time. Of course, I'm a sucker for a sappy singer-songwriter guy with some strings accompanying him.
B0000640S1|4.0|While I do appreciate getting both Full &amp; Widescreen versions of this film in the twin-disk package, the lack of any meaningful extras brings the the rating for this DVD set down considerably. That, along with the fact that there are no English subtitles available for the largest buying-base for this title, English speaking AMERICANS. Oh well, I suppose I'll have to wait for the &quot;Criterion Collection&quot; for the wanted extras. :&gt;)<br />Rating: Performance(5), Special Edition DVD(3)
B00005JM1F|2.0|I am NOT a big fan of Will Ferrel, but my friends said that it was hilarious and that I should check it out. This movie was an OK effort. I just thought that it could have been alot better. Some characters were not developed enough in my opinion (i.e. Blue). It was fun, but not all it was hyped up to be. It is not the same caliber of comedy as any National Lampoons film (except for 7 Deadly Sins which stunk) and to compare it to Animal House is sacrilige.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Final Flight of the Osiris: Many people liked this short alot. I have to admit the CGI was great but I thought it was lacking. It was very short and didn't really explain anything we don't know. But it is worth watching.<br />The second renaissance parts I and II: These two shorts had to be my favorite on the DVD. They were AWESOME. The animation was beautiful and I loved the narration and whole explanation of how it was humans who were responsible for the beginning of The Matrix. Watch it and many things will be clear to you. Kind of a prequel to The Matrix movie.<br />Kid's Story- If you have seen Reloaded and was at all interested in the kid who claimed Neo saved his life you will definitely want to see this short. It shows what happened and how the kid is tied to Neo. I personally enjoyed this one. The animation was very very nice and I just thought it was an excellent addition to the explanation of Reloaded.<br />Program- I liked it because I didn't find it at all predictable. I didn't know where it was going and until the end you are left kind of confused. A 3 out of 5 rating for this one.<br />World Record- I definitely did NOT like this one AT ALL. It was bland and the character was not appealing. I only watched it once and maybe i didn't get the jist of it but I didn't find it appealing enough to watch again.<br />Beyond- Many people enjoyed this one saying it was &quot;touching&quot; but   i thought it pointless. I guess it was &quot;cute&quot; but other then that, not much point to it.<br />A Detective Story- I LOVED this one! If you like Trinity you are in for a treat, the only short which features a character from the movies (besides a short appearance by Neo in &quot;Kid's story&quot;). It's filmed in black and white and gives it a styliazed feel. Not much explanation about where Trinity is from or her real name though...<br />Matriculated- I didn't enjoy this one much. Characters weren't all that great. Very bizzare. But deep meaning, i suppose.<br />So in conclusion, This DVD was jam packed with excellent shorts and I recommend it for any Matrix fan! It's a must have!
B000001ES9|2.0|Classic rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple all had really strong debut albums. Rush did not.  The lyrics on this CD are all very amateurish, especially the lame rocker In The Mood.  John Rutsey is an okay drummer but he cannot hold a candle to Neil Peart.  Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee show promise as the great musicians that they are but the album comes across as too Zepellinesque.  The only worth while song here is Working Man.  The band did have to start somewhere and they did get better.  This is for die hard fans only.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Audioslave is pretty disappointing to me.  I love Soundgarden, especially the Loud Love disc, which you should buy if you don't own it already.  I love RATM, they wrote songs about things that they felt strongly about, much in the tradition of Dylan.  But when you put Cornell with the musicians in RATM, somehow you get something that sounds like everything else out there.<br />Where is the innovative guitar that we all know that Morello can play?  He slips into mediocrity very well here, and I for one am very disappointed.<br />Cornell took all the rage, power, and originality out of Soundgarden before they disbanded 2 discs too late, and now he seems to have done the same to the RATM musicians.<br />The ones of us who REALLY know RATM, and I see some of the reveiwers do not, know that Morello is the REAL political left-winger in RATM, even though it was De La Rocha who was left to spout out the lyrics.  Where is the political and social relevance of this disc.  It is gone, so now they have no real message.  They are now every other band on the radio.<br />On the upside, at least I know when I can go get another beer at Lollapalooza in Atlanta.  It will be during the Audioslave set.
B000001ESN|4.0|Permanent Waves only contains about thirty five minute worth of music.  The good news is that four out of the six songs here are really impressive.  The Spirit Of Radio and Freewill, both radio classics, are two of the best songs Rush has ever recorded and most likely you have heard them.  Jacob's Ladder is a song about Neil Pearts fascination with weather.  The lyrics and strong as is the musicianship.  The instrumental section in the song is one of the bands best.  Things get kind of tired with Entre Nous, a song about a necessary break in a relationship.  This contains the lyrics &quot;We are strangers to each other / Full of sliding panels / An illusion show /Acting well-rehearsed routines&quot;  It seems that Neil Peart wants to distance himself from his fans.  This song is not as strong as the first three on this album.  Different Strings is possible one of the weakest songs the band has ever recorded.  The music is dull, and the lyrics provided by Geddy Lee are weak.  Another example of why Neil Peart should be the band's only lyric writer.  The final song is Natural Science and is the best on the album.  Nine minutes of sonic bliss.  This is not quite as good as Moving Pictures but is highly recommended.
0142004235|3.0|If you've read any of Steinbeck's other books, don't expect anything different from this one.  You either love him or you hate him.  I've never been a fan of his, but it had been a while and having made such an impression on Oprah, I decided to give East of Eden a shot.<BR>  <BR>It seems trite to say the book was depressing, but heck, it was really depressing.  The message is that we all have free will, but that's not breaking news to me and reading it was too much like tedious homework.  The lesson was conveyed and learned, but it was not an enjoyable process.  I just couldn't connect with the characters which, in my humble opinion, were never developed enough to incite any real empathy from me.  I just watched on in disgust.<br />In looking back, I recognize the genius and the simplicity of the theme and how he incorporated it into the novel.  I'll also admit (reluctantly) that the book was very well written and successfully delivered the message.  I applaud Steinbeck's writing skills, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.   <br />Alas, in the spirit of the book, we all have free will, so I won't choose to read Steinbeck again.  I was disappointed in the read, but I'm sure my book club's discussion will be interesting.  If you are in a book club or want something to talk about at the water cooler, then have at it.  If you are just getting back into reading or looking for a good book to sink into, I would suggest you look elsewhere.  If you don't know where to start, look at the reviews from a favorite book, find someone who had a similar opinion and look at that persons lists and other reviews.  I've found some real gems that way.
B000001ESP|5.0|Back in 1981 most pop acts were releasing new wave songs or heavy metal songs.  Rush, never a band to follow trends released Moving Pictures.  Every song here is a classic.  The album opener, Tom Sawyer, is one of the most overplayed songs in rock.  It's also a really good tune.  Most people reading this have most likely heard Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and Limelight, and perhaps even YYZ.  All wonderful songs.  However those who do not own this album are missing out on the last three (never played on the radio) tracks. The Camera Eye is an eleven minute track feature a great riff by guitarist Alex Lifeson and drumming by Neil Peart.  Geddy Lee's singing on this is top notch.  Witch Hunt is a haunting song about those who wish to run our lives.  It's about the kind of people who want Harry Potter banned from you bookstores and who fear sharing the world with people from different cultures.  It's about fear mongering basically and is a perfect tune.  The album closes with Vital Signs.  A lot of technical terms are used in the lyrics.  A very solid closer to a very solid CD.  Moving Pictures rates along side Led Zeppelin IV, The Dark Side Of The Moon, And Van Halen Fair Warning as one of the best rock albums ever recorded.  A must have.
B00009W0U4|3.0|There were several reasons that attracted me to this movie in the first beginning -<BR>a. the reverse order of storytelling - honestly, after watching MEMENTO, with a much more suspenseful and complex story, I didn't find any more excitement in IRREVERSIBLE.<BR>b. Violence - yes, the first scene in the bar was truly violent, and also the tunnel [assault] scene, not graphically violent, but the 10+ minutes non-stop-without-a-cut scene was very blunt.<BR>c. Monica Bellucci - yes, she was very beautiful, sexy as ever.  <br />Besides these, the story was a little too simple, the acting was not that great as some reviewers said, and the cinematography was sometimes annoying, especially the whirling camera work and the flashing effect which made me totally dizzy.  Yes, you may call this movie, but I would enjoy something else.
B000001ESF|4.0|The title track on Rush's 2112 is their best epic.  Inspired by author Ayn Rand, 2112 tells the futuristic story of a society ruled by the high priest.  Everyone is to exist in a collective mind frame and expression and free thought are frowned upon.  One day the hero of the song finds a guitar.  He has never seen one before, plucks the strings, and is awed.  He brings this guitar to the high priest who are most displeased with seeing this instrument.  Our hero is told the guitar is, &quot;another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man&quot;  The guitar is destoryed and our hero retreats to a cave where he succumbs to depression.  Who wants to live in such a world after all.  The song is powerful, the musicianship is first rate, and the lyrics are wonderful.  The rest of the album contains two songs, A Passage To Bangkok and Something For Nothing which were probably great songs for 1976 Rush standards but are now forgettable.  The other three songs, The Twilight Zone, Lessons, and Tears, are duds.  This release is worth owning for the classic title track.
B00005JLSE|5.0|When I first saw it, I immediately knew this would be the Oscar winner.  And I enjoyed it just as much the second and third time.  True, there are better singers and dancers, but then again, those people usually cannot act.  I thought everyone associated with this movie did an outstanding job.  And Rene Z was robbed--she nailed the part!
0140186409|5.0|I write this review from the perspective of a union-side labor attorney.  Prior to reading this novel, I only knew that the subject of the novel was a group of &quot;Okies&quot; (dust-bowl farmers from Oklahoma) and their struggle to survive the Great Depression.  However, that is just the protagonists' starting point.  From these origins, the Joad family is evicted from their nearly worthless farmland and are forced to travel westward to California.  California to the Joad family--and thousands of families like them--is a promised land of milk and honey.  As they continue to travel and ultimately arrive in California, they discover it is anything but a promised land.<br />And here is where Steinbeck's utter rage shines through.  The Joad family (and thousands of families like theirs) travels to California because they have seen flyers proclaiming the need for grape pickers, peach pickers, cotton pickers, etc.  The flyer states that 500 pickers are needed.  In reality, only 250 pickers are needed.  Additionally, the printers of these flyers (the greedy farm corporations, replacing the individual farmers) distribute these flyers to far more than 500 people.  Thousands and thousands of people receive the flyers, creating the farm corporations' dream come true--a glut of starving workers fighting for any job they can get.<br />Therefore, the starving workers undercut each other.  While one worker says he will work for $.25 per day, the other worker who is hungrier says that if he gets the job, he will only require $.20 per day.  The vicious cycle continues.  The rich get richer, and the workers starve.  And the outbidding is really the best time of the year--in the winter, there is no work and hence no bidding or money.  Whenever anyone talks about organizing the workforce, he is labeled a &quot;red&quot; and either put on a blacklist or killed on the spot.<br />This book is really a rallying cry for the necessity of unions.  There are people who now say that unions have served their purpose and are no longer necessary.  To that, I must respond that those people do not really understand the watchdog effect of unions.<br />It seems that people remember &quot;The Jungle&quot; as more of a tribute to unions than &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;  I have read &quot;The Jungle&quot; also, and while I think it is a great book and a very important one, it lacks the literary finesse of Steinbeck.  Both books are stories of rage, but Steinbeck's prose is beautiful, haunting, both mournful and intensely angry.  As he writes an indictment of the farming corporations, he also writes a love song to America, highlighting the beauty of its land and the bravery and kindness of its people.  The Joad family is overwhelmingly good even in the face of one of the cruelest chapters of American history.  The last paragraph of the novel both breaks your heart and renews your faith in humanity.have served their purpose and are no longer necessary.

0792844890|5.0|Science Fiction movies have been ammunition for comedians since their creation, but no one has hit the target as well as Mel Brooks did when he unleashed Spaceballs upon the world.<br />Arguably one of the funniest comedies ever created (and my personal favorite), Spaceballs parodies a dozen sci-fi flicks, from Star Wars to Alien to Planet of the Apes.<br />The DVD itself was a bit disappointing.  While director's commentaries and &quot;Making of...&quot; reels are interesting, they are also standard fare.  Features such as outtakes and blooper reels would have been perfect, especially for a comedy of this caliber.<br />Overall, this is a superb movie with unmatched comic timing and hilarious parodies.  Recommended for anyone with the slightest sense of humor.
B00003CXE6|4.0|Gladiator is a richly textured, well-written, and most of all truly spectacular film, I realy liked it. There is a lot of action and suspense.<br />But it's a bit too violent.<br />The actors act very well particularly Russell Crowe.<br />The characters are very attaching so you feel often sad.<br />Crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks. His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for.<br />Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and intelligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence.<br />The fact that Commodus has done and tried to do such sick and evil things makes you really hate him.<br />Roger Ebert said that a quirkier actor might have been more fun in the role.<br />But if there was, you probably wouldn't be able to hate Commodus as much.<br />The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more. Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.<br />Gladiator\\" starts off with a bang as the Roman Legions battle Germanic hoards in the forests of Southern Germany. It is spectacularly staged, with the stoic Russel Crowe (Maximus) leading the charge and hacking away at opposing fighters.<br />After the fight, Maximus learns from the ailing Emperor Marcus Aruelius (Harris) that he is be the Emperors' heir, and not the Emperor's son, Commadus (Phoenix).<br />Commadus goes berserk and Maximus is forced to flee and he finds his family back home dead.<br /> In despair, he wanders aimlessly collasping in an open plain and picked up by a group of Gladiator recruiters, led by a former Gladiator named Proximo (Reed). From there, Maximus is a Gladiator fighting in pest-infested arenas, waiting for his chance to return to Rome and Commadus.<br />So I liked it and I recommended it!
B000066NW0|5.0|Usually when I buy an album I am happy with 2 or 3 killer songs with a few good songs thrown in, the rest being of no interest to me.  When I went out to buy this album I did so for the 3 or 4 songs I'd heard on the net.  I assumed they were the few killer songs on the album, maybe there'd be another gem or two on there to suprise me.  However once I listened to this album I was amazed to find that every song on it is, at the very least, extremely good, with the massive majority of the album being absolutely brilliant.<br />The diversity of styles in this album is another plus in my opinion.  Most albums I hear are of all one style and while this is fine it can be a bit boring.  This album ranges in style from pop to country to rock and more.  Also as if the songs themselves weren't great enough Avril's voice is even better.  Part angel, part rock chick, her sound is both beautiful and truley unique.<br />Forget some of the people who want to critisize her and say she's fake.  Because in the end they're always the same.  Bitter people who think it makes them sound clever and different (when in reality there anything but) to attempt there amature critique character assasination on people they're simply jealous of.  As far as I can see Avril is a truley unique and brilliant artist and is clearly anything but fake.<br />In conclusion, in my opinion Let Go has to be the best album of the year and overall one of the best I've ever heard.  Its definitely in my top 5 albums of all time with the likes of The Marshal Mathers LP (Eminem) and Nevermind (Nirvana).
B00003CXTF|5.0|I loved the story, it's never boring and it's very realistic.<BR>I liked the friendship between the characters too.<BR>And it is entertaining.<BR>The actors act very well.<BR>The special effects, I have to say, were amazing, among the best I have ever seen. <BR>The explosions are huge, the lifting up of the deck just before the Arizona exploded was quite impressive, the sight of Japanese planes zooming over Pearl Harbour just above ground level was breathtaking, the sight of bodies being literally thrown into the air as a result of explosions was incredible, <BR>and the listing and capsizing of the Oklahoma was downright amazing.<BR>This movie definitely deserves 5 stars!!
B00005JLT5|4.0|This must be one of the finest, amazing films I have recently seen. While the comparisons with Spielberg's 'Schlinder's List' seem unavoidable, they are also unfair to a degree. While 'Schlinder's list' does an excellent job of moving the audience to tears at the end, it still can't help bear a given \\"Hollywood-esque\\" feeling to it. Not so with The Pianist - The fateful scenes between Jews and Nazi Germans have that something that gives you that uneasy feeling that comes when you are watching something that is stark real and impacting, to the point you forget that you are actually watching a movie - now, that's quite a sign of movie mastery for me.<br />While several parts of the movie could have been quite shortened without affecting the film as a whole (Spilzman' reclusion on the German zone apartment comes to mind), it is not a do-or-die factor either. Hey, SL lasts way longer than 2.5 hours and no one complains... Sure, the film doesn't uncover new ground in regards of the Nazi barbarie against European Jews either, but by the same token, what else can be said about it that hasn't been said before? 'The Pianist' doesn't attempt to be another Holocaust documentary film - but a history of the struggles of a young man to survive in the most hostile of environments. Leave the Holocaust setting aside and still can be a worthwhile argument for a movie.<br />That said, if you're into SL and related films, you should try to see 'The Pianist'. This film will definitely make a worthy companion to those two.
B00005JKTF|4.0|I was thoroughly moved by this film. What's the problem of having the actors speak English in France?  A little unrealistic but...most Americans aren't fluent in both languages.  I'd much rather have it in English than have to read subtitles the entire time.  If you want more historical accuracy, go watch a documentary.  Look at the title.  This movie is about a woman's journey.  I thought there was just enough historical relevancy to suit the film's purposes.  The plot is inspiring and always taking an unexpected turn. The relationships develop quickly but are strong.  Maybe I'm melodramatic, but I'd watch this movie again and again and again...
6304298285|4.0|A: 4/5 Stars<br />  Robin Williams gives an outstanding performance in \\"Jack\\", a movie about a boy with an extreme growing disorder.  <BR>  We first see Mrs. Powell dressed as a witch at a costume party from which she is rushed to a hospital where she gives birth to Jack Powell after being pregnant for only ten weeks.  We learn that Jack has a disorder that causes him to grow four times the normal human rate.<BR>  We then see Jack spending his days lonely and holed up in his home, a ten year-old boy that has the physical body of a forty year-old man.

By this time Jack appears to be an elderly man, but is really 18.  <BR>  Jack is a heart warming and laughter provoking movie about enjoying life while you have it, and I highly recommend it.<br />J: 4/5 Stars <br />  \\"When a shooting star streaks through the blackness turning night into day, make a wish and think of me and make your life spectacular.  I know I did.\\"  -Robin Willliams as Jack <BR>  Jack is a bittersweet tale about a boy who, despite certain setbacks, is determined to live and enjoy his childhood.  <BR>  The movie begins after an odd premature birth, where we learn that Jack ages at four times the average rate.  Because of this he is kept out of society for ten years.  Jack is visited by a tutor (Bill Cosby) every day.  Although the tutor likes teaching Jack, he realizes that he is lonely and convinces Jack's parents to insert him into the public education system.  At first he isn't too popular, but finally he wins over the class by using his condition to his advantage.  The wayshe gets them to accept him are refreshingly true: he can buy porno magazines  and dominate the basketball courts.  However, Jack has several confrontations with the adult world.  His attempts of getting together with his school teacher fails and ends up getting in a brawl at at the local bar.  It doesn't help when he recieves a \\"what I want to be when I grow up\\" assignment that truly affects him.  When his friends are twenty he will probably be dead.  The movie ends with a speech of triumph that is both tear jerking and heart warming.  <BR>  Robin Williams definitely wins the best perfomance award.  Here, he is able to bring a poignancy to the role while capturing the youthfulness of being a kid.  Francois Ford Coppolay who is usually the director of hard, serious dramas, (see the Godfather) has taken a different route by making a human drama enclosed by comedy.  Because of this, he has made one of the most honest movies in recent years.  Jack is a joy to watch and a movie to treasure.
B00005JM0B|1.0|I must say that I was extremely excited when I heard that they were making a third Terminator movie.  I checked Yahoo Movies frequently to get updates on production.  I even went to see MIB 2 just for the first T3 preview.  I am a Terminator fan.  I grew up watching the first.  I was blown away with the script, acting, and special effects of the second.<br />However the third succeeds in one thing, ripping the emotion out of the series.  I couldn't believe that the movie started without the Terminator theme.  In fact, you didn't hear it until the end credits.  I'm sorry, but I think that music strikes the suspense and emotion in every film.  They must have cut costs to pay for Arnold's $30 mil salary.  <br />The only returning actor was Arnold.  Hello, I should have figured out why the original cast wasn't returning - a horrible script!  <br />THE SCRIPT - Ok, we found out in the first 2 that \\"There is no fate, but what we make.\\"  Correct?  <br />THE FOLLOWING ARE T3 MAJOR PLOT HOLES:  <BR>#1  Then why in T3 did the Terminator tell John Connor that Judgment Day was destined to happen, it can't be stopped.  If this were true, whey did the future John send Kyle Reese to deliver the \\"no fate\\" message to Sarah Connor?  He wouldn't, John would have known that there is a fate. <BR>#2  If there were a destiny, then the destiny would remain the same for everyone right?  If that were true, the future would remain the same for everyone and Judgment Day would remain on 8/29/97.  <BR>#3  It was said that the General who started SkyNet was the key.  Oh, the key was just an everyday man who could push a Y on the screen & not the biophysicist who came up with the technology.  Give me a break!  How did the technology magically become the same as Miles Dyson's?  Everything was destroyed!  The movie only said that it was inevitable - there was no explanation to how the technology was duplicated.  That's like saying if Einstein was killed & his inventions & calculations completely destroyed, that someone would have split the atom a few years later in the exact same fashion.  Yeah Right!  There would be major timeline & functioning differences.  I mean just think of the beginning development of PC's, even MAC & IBM used different systems.<BR>#4  James Cameron, who created the series intended for T2 to end it.  Just buy the DVD & check out the deleted scenes.  You will see one of Sarah Connor in 2029 saying that Judgment Day never happened.  Why would it?  Everything was destroyed in T2!  I still believe in \\"NO FATE!\\"

The wayshe gets them to accept him are refreshingly true: he can buy porno magazines  and dominate the basketball courts.  However, Jack has several confrontations with the adult world.  His attempts of getting together with his school teacher fails and ends up getting in a brawl at at the local bar.  It doesn't help when he recieves a \\"what I want to be when I grow up\\" assignment that truly affects him.  When his friends are twenty he will probably be dead.  The movie ends with a speech of triumph that is both tear jerking and heart warming.  <BR>  Robin Williams definitely wins the best perfomance award.  Here, he is able to bring a poignancy to the role while capturing the youthfulness of being a kid.  Francois Ford Coppolay who is usually the director of hard, serious dramas, (see the Godfather) has taken a different route by making a human drama enclosed by comedy.  Because of this, he has made one of the most honest movies in recent years.  Jack is a joy to watch and a movie to treasure.
0385504209|2.0|This was Umberto's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; light.  There are stories of the Templars, ancient secrets protected over thousands of years, but there is no depth or weight.  I would compare this book to reading the back flap of &quot;Lempriere's Dictionary&quot; by Norfolk, which is a much better read and would take about the same time too.
B00008977N|5.0|I was not a fan of PG, though, I`d heard some of his most popular material before. I rent this concert thru Netflix a month ago and was totally blown away! This is by far the best concert audio/mix that I'd heard before (I have over 50 concert/music DVDs). And the performance,   I don't have words  to describe how awesome it is.  Needless to say, I went to Borders that same day and bought it. Yes, the video is a bit grainy, but film medium is naturally that way. Besides, even if the video quality is not good (which this is not the case) it still worth every penny.
B0000A36J5|1.0|This movie is really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad.  I would neither watch it again nor would I reccomend <BR>that anyone else watch it because it is so really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad.  It smells of rotten eggs and<BR>dead fish.  It tastes like spoiled meat and burnt cookies.  It is just so really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad.
0684833395|3.0|here are a few recommendations.  <br />If you want to laugh out loud and tell your friends about the funniest book you've ever read, pick up something by Bill Bryson or Tony Horowitz.  If you want to read &quot;the best book you've ever read&quot; pick up a Dickens, Stienbeck, Orwell, Twain, or Harper Lee and surely you won't be disappointed.<br />This book is definitely different and I will not go so far as to say avoid it, or even that I didn't enjoy it simply because Heller tells his story in such a unique way, but to put such a book on a pedestal above works by the authors I have mentioned, which is by no means a complete list, is ridiculous.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Although nothing Mike Meyers has done recently has come even close to as great as So I Married an Axe Murderer, at least this is better than the first two Austin Powers movies.  The first 10 minutes of this movie are side-splittingly funny and worth watching repeatedly, after that I can't say much.  Beyonce Knowles is definitely the best sidekick so far.  She is beautiful, funny, and knows how to sing and she never does more with Austin then give him a tiny kiss.  This movie is slightly less vulgar than the others, but still a crass movie.  I give it 2.5 stars.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|There is no possible way to capture the genius and beauty in the talent of ATDI's latest and perhaps last work in words. ATDI's music doesn't demand a certain proclivity for hardcore or punk or screamo, or any genre at that. They are pretty much gods. Real emotion has never been so efficiently conveyed in any type of media, least of all music. GOD DAMNIT I WISH I HAD A SPLINTER OF THIER GENIUS PUMPING THROUGH MY VEINS. I can only say that with ATDI as a whole no longer together and creating - if i believed in god - god-sent musical orgasms, the world is less whole than it used to be. another user said it best: &quot;buy. listen. worship.&quot;
B00008NRI8|4.0|I just watched this movie for the first time and now I need to buy my own copy.   This movie is SO funny!   I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan, but nonetheless this was a great show (and if you like her a lot it's probably even better).   The writing is extremely funny and Hugh Grant gives his best performance to date.   Overall I would rank this as one of the best romantic comedies, right up there with Notting Hill and The Wedding Planner and just below the Princess Bride.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film....and made beachgoers ask themselves if that dip in the ocean was really necessary.<br />Screenwriters Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb (who also have roles in the movie) wisely jettison the melodramatic aspects of the source novel and focus on the core of the story.<br />It's summer in Amity, a sleepy Long Island town that depends on \\"summer dollars\\" from thousands of tourists who come to stay in seaside cottages (the summer dinks, they are called). When a young girl goes skinny dipping in the nearby sea and is fatally attacked by a shark, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is coerced by the mayor and town council to keep the incident under wraps. He reluctantly does so, though he will regret it, for a few days later, the shark claims another victim, a young boy named Alex Kintner.<br />Finally convinced that there is a shark out there, Amity's politicians and citizens take action...but not wisely. When shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) bids for a contract to catch and kill the shark, the town elders \\"take it under advisement\\" and the shark hunt becomes a wild free-for-all seagoing circus.<br />When shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), called in by Chief Brody to help in the investigation and shark hunt, arrives and sees the shark (which he identifies as a tiger shark) caught by local fishermen, he examines the remains of the first victim. What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.<br />Jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel. The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark....becoming the hunted in the process. Spielberg, only 27 at the time, overcame the difficulties of shooting a movie on the water and dealing with a balky mechanical shark (nicknamed \\"Bruce\\"). Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now-famous \\"shark motif\\" and would earn him his second Oscar for Best Score.<br />The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is excellent. The movie is presented in letterbox format, and the sound and image are above average. The documentary on the making of the film is also first-rate. All in all, a must-get for Spielberg (and action film) fans.ark....becoming the hunted in the process.

B000083E79|5.0|This is one of the best collection of Cher songs. This ranges from heer early days all the way to her recent hit Song For The Lonely. If you still have doupts about getting this cd I'm telling you go for it. You won't feel sorry! THE VERY BEST OF CHER! ALSO CHECK OUT LIVING PROOF CD!
B00005JLR2|4.0|I am a cartoon collector and a big Disney fan, but I had not seen this movie until last week when I bought a used copy of the DVD.   It was a good purchase.   Great Disney movie.   Not much singing (maybe 2 songs) for those of you who are not into Disney musicals.   Very fun, great animation (both regular and digital), good action, great comedy, and lots of heart.   The most colorful Disney characters since Alice in Wonderland and almost as funny as The Emperor's New Groove.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Finally, Halloween is closed-captioned!    There are many releases of Halloween and this is the first one to be closed-captioned!    I emailed the company about the captioning and they told me that Anchor Bay Entertainment had been sold to new owners who were more receptive to closed-captioning their films.    I'm beyond thrilled that I don't have to hope that the edited TV version will be captioned by the channel since now I have this DVD!    Thank you Anchor Bay Entertainment!
B00005JKZV|4.0|Another great movie based on the Tolkein books!   This one is action, action, action! The plot moves a bit slower than the first, and deviated more from the book, but it was still excellent and well worth seeing.  I realize that writers and directors cannot be fully faithful to the books but I have to bones to pick.  First, why is Faramir of a totally different character in the movie than in the film?  He is supposed to be nothing like Boramir.  Second, I realize they wanted to make good use of Liv Tyler, but some of the stuff with her in it is condradictory to the books.  Anyway, this one is not quite as great as Fellowship, but still very good.   Gollum was so life-like and true to character, he really made the movie for me.  I also greatly enjoyed the Dead Marshes.  I can't wait to see the expanded edition!!!<BR>I actually would give this 4.5 stars.
B00009L1TA|4.0|I went to see this movie since I enjoy any movie featuring John Travolta and was expecting a regular action movie - I was quite overwhelmed. This is a fast pace, (mostly) intelligent movie, which moves along different lines then those you are used to. The film's ending is yet to be discussed and I can only say that my understanding of the film's events was totally changed at the last 5 minutes.  I am not sure this ending was truly necessary - for me it was only a gimmick and the whole logic and understanding of the film was totally shattered. <BR>The movie starts with a great scene of a military helicopter making its way through a stormy rain with the knowledge of a great storm breaking in.  The helicopter holds a team of seven men and one woman, headed by the great Samuel Jackson playing the tough Sgt. West. You cannot but feel pity for this wet group of people wondering what does the near future hold for them.  <BR>The next scene is filmed 17 hours later when something is understood to have gone wrong with the team. The search team arrives in time to catch three men involved in a gun fight. One man dies, one man is wounded and the surviving soldier is not ready to talk. Hence - enter John Travolta, a former army interrogator, asked to find out what has happened. Travolta arrives after the regular interrogator (Connie Nielsen) is unable to get any information from the survivors. Together with Travolta they start a search for the truth of what happened, a search that becomes harder with every new piece of evidence.<BR>This is not a movie that \\"goes home with you\\" or that gives you a new understanding of life, but is very entertaining and there is no dull moment.  <BR>Great act of Travolta (charming as always) Connie Nielsen and Samuel Jackson.
014028009X|3.0|Very funny, especially if you're a woman.   Although she's overexagerating how many drinks and cigarettes she has in a day, sometimes the amounts are so high I don't find it amusing, just worriesome.   Mostly this is a very clever comedy that will actually make you laugh out loud.   It is written by a British author and you'll have to get used to the language and sometimes you'll have to admit you just don't know what that word means (there is different slang in the UK than the US), which actually adds to the humour at times.   Bridgette's cooking fiascos (2 of them) are probably my favorite parts in the book.   The last few chapter's of the book are a not-so-good attempt at being a modern-day Pride and Prejudice, but none-the-less this is a quick read that is very funny.   It really has no redeeming value though or I may have given it 3 1/2 stars.
B000003TAR|5.0|Considered the next biggest Nirvana release since Nevermind in 1991, In Utero is truly Cobain at his best.  Better known for its singles, Heart-Shaped Box, Rape Me, and All Apologies.<br />Be sure to listen for the bonus track, Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through The Strip.  Also take not that some versions of the album have this track hidden, while on some others you can just skip to it with your CD player.  Even though the bonus track sounds like it was made up on the spot for a good 7 minutes and 33 seconds, it doesn't effect the rest of the album in any bad ways.<br />The only down side I can mention about this CD is that the lyrics for the bonus track, and \\"tourette's\\" are not what they seem.  But there's always the internet if you want to look them up.

B00005JLRT|4.0|Not a bad movie. A must own if your a Trek fan.
0743216385|4.0|Stephen Ambrose wasn't the greatest writer in the world - he won't dazzle you with his prose here - but he was adept at giving the reader revealing glimpses of life as a soldier in World War II. That's exactly what he does here in Band of Brothers, which inspired the dazzling 10-hour HBO miniseries of the same name.<br />Crisp and fast-paced, Band of Brothers does not get as bogged down in detail his other best-known works WWII, D-Day and Citizen Soldier. For the researcher that may not be a good thing, but for the reader (especially the casual reader just looking for some WWII insight) it provides a good read that educates AND entertains. That's a valuable mix in bringing history to the masses.<br />Those who have read both Citizen Solider and D-Day might appreciate the brief dip back into Ambrose waters, but they might also be turned off by the anecdotes from those books repeated here. It appears much of the research that went into those books was also used for Band of Brothers. That's not to say there is nothing new here. There is. This is a book smaller in scope because the focus is on one company - Easy Company of the 101st Airborne.<br />Band of Brothers is a good, solid World War II read that should satisfy all save the most scholarly of WWII readers, who are better off avoiding this in lieu of a tome more dense with information. At its core, Band of Brothers is a book that allows a bunch of WWII vets to recount old war stories. And that makes for some enjoyable reading.
B00005JM09|1.0|What a huge disappointment. I had high hopes for this movie, but it was full of plot holes, and lacked the heart of the first two.  Kristanna Loken looked more like a ticked off barbie doll than anything else.  There were too many corny one-liners. One or two is fine, but this movie started sounding more like a spoof of the first two after a while.  If you want to see an action movie with a lot of destruction..this is your movie.  But if you are expecting a Terminator movie with any sort of plot line, forget it.  The only positive in this movie is the amazing shape Arnold is in. He is still going strong..too bad the movie couldn't match up.
B00006CXSS|5.0|First and foremost is this: If you're a fan of World War II films, whether of the epic-in-scope variety or the up-close-and-personal type, purchase this DVD set right now. You'll not regret it, and without question you'll watch all ten hours multiple times.<br />Band of Brothers is a well-crafted, well-produced ten-hour epic following the exploits of one World War II Company from their pre-combat training, through D-Day and on through the end of the war. While it focuses on this one company - Easy Company - the series is without question epic in scope, featuring hundreds of actors, a huge cast, fantastic sets that capture WWII Europe and magnificent combat scenes.<br />On the personal side, Band of Brothers allows you to get to know a rotating cast of core characters very well, with most of camera time focusing on a solid six to eight soldiers in Easy Company. The performances throughout are excellent, giving you a good understanding of and sympathy for the men portrayed on screen. Lovers of war film camaraderie will love large portions of this series (which, to me, is almost more of a ten-hour film than a miniseries) thanks to some good chemistry.<br />On the epic side, Band of Brothers shines, mixing equal parts Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far to give viewers a sense of the grand scale in which this small band is fighting. The vistas are stunning, the action powerful, and fighting brutal. From the huge drop the night before D-Day to sieges of French towns to the shelling at Bastogne and more, this series thrills with its exciting, often gruesome combat footage.<br />No, the price tag on this hefty set isn't small, but it's undoubtedly worth it, as you'll want to watch your favorite installments over and over again. Even if this set featured only the very best episodes (2, 3, 5, 7, and the very moving 9) it would be worth every penny. But this now.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is rather low-key, subtle almost.  It took a few minutes to &quot;get it&quot; but when I did, and grew comfortable with the pattern, it was a good watch.  You are both intrigued and saddened at the plight of the poor guy whose short term memory is REALLY short term.<br />The backwards plot is, of course, the outstanding feature but if the acting, dialogue and plot were not excellent, that fabulous plot would have been for naught.   We've all seen moview, read books, viewed television shows that had intriguing stories only to lose interest when other elements were not up to par. This movie avoided that dilemma with a catchy dialogue, good actors and an even, arching direction that brought the entire story into focus.  Rent the DVD and enjoy

Sadly, on this album you won't find anything really comparable to well-crafted songs like 'Roses from my friends'and 'Jah work' -from 'The will to live' cd- or songs showing tremendous depth and intensity like 'Widow of a living man' and 'I shall not walk alone'-also from 'The will to live'.<BR>Get 'The will to live' cd instead -in my opinion still his best album to date- coupled with the beautiful 'Live from Mars' -Ben playing live almost all of his best songs!- and you'll have a pretty much complete view of this talented musician.

0316666343|2.0|Despite what the reviews on the dust jacket and in many publications, this book is full of angst to the point that many readers may have to go on Prozac to finish.  DO not believe the review that states the book has &quot;funny&quot; moments.  This is a depressing read that even the supposed try at a &quot;happy&quot; ending does nothing to diminish.  Maybe I am shallow, but I raced through this quickly to try and start reading someting that makes me feel something other than sad.  It is a fairly well-written book, although you could probably skim through much of it and get the same effect in less time.  Let the buyer beware in this case.

B000002AVF|1.0|It seems that all today's so-called artists can do is make wholesale ripoffs of yesterday's (much better) artists.  Witness Mariah Carey's \\"Fantasy\\":  This is not just a \\"reinterpretation\\" of Tom Tom Club's \\"Genius Of Love\\" -- it is, for all intents and purposes, EXACTLY the backing track Genius of Love.  Over this, Carey does what she does best:  goes through a bunch of vocal showboating and histrionics that ultimately add up to a MUCH MUCH inferior melody than what was in Tom Tom Club's brilliant and fun original single.  So goes the \\"creative process\\" of today.  Sheesh.<br />Much of the rest of the album is the same vocal histrionics.  Carey sings as if she is constantly trying to prove to us that her voice can go all over the place, several octaves in either direction.  Great, you can go way up high and do trilly little things with your voice, yeah we've heard that before.  So how about giving us a good melody along with it?  Or perhaps show a little restraint when it comes to the vocal showboating?  Instead of running your voice all over the dang musical staff, how about just finding a nice melody and singing it straight for once?  Carey doesn't seem to refrain from adding a bazillion unnecessary notes to every lead line in a song.

B00005QCVY|5.0|With almost 200 reviews, there probably isn't much I can add to this, but I did want to make a few comments. And one comment I hadn't seen elsewhere since it's more a piece of exotic movie trivia.<br />This great movie has been known to bring tears to the eyes of big, strong men, and I have to admit I'm no different. (In fact, just thinking about the film to write this review sort of brought tears to my eyes). Based on the depression-era short story by Phillip van Doren Stern, Capra uses the humble but uplifting story of George Bailey to bring his hopeful vision of humanity to the silver screen. He not only does justice to the story but produced a movie that transcends the genre to become a timeless story of the human spirit.<br />Stewart turns in probably his most famous performance in the character of George Bailey, a marginally successful but respected and well-liked small-town businessman who had hoped and dreamed of greater things but who is resigned to his humble fate. He'd dreamed of college and travel and a different career from the humble Building and Loan he runs but fate has conspired to give his younger brother the opportunities instead, so George believes life has mostly passed him by.<br />Then disaster strikes, and we see George brought to the brink of suicide and back again, discovering in the process that he really had a great life after all, and that the true meaning of life isn't so much in the accomplishment of outward achievements so much as in how we touch the lives and minds and hearts of others.<br />About that piece of trivia I mentioned. Remember the guy in the bridge toll booth when George tries to commit suicide, and is saved by his guardian angel, played by Henry Travers? This was the guy with the long face and thick crop of wavy hair. It was one of the funnier scenes in the movie, as he reacts to Clarence's revelations to Stewart about being an angel.<br />Anyway, I'm not certain, but I think he appears briefly 10 years later in an uncredited role in the 1958 film, The Big Country, starring Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Jean Simmons, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors. He's the one who asks Peck at the party in the Colonel's house if he's seen anything as big as the country out west. Peck, being a former sea captain, says, \\"Why yes, a couple of oceans.\\" And then he makes the same bewildered expressions as he did back in the toll booth in It's a Wonderful Life. Anyway, whoever he was, he had quite a mug and worked perfectly for these little bit parts, usually playing some local hick or hayseed with a rubber face who could make the most comical expressions. The International Movie Database website credits him as Tom Fadden in It's a Wonderful Life, but not in The Big Country, so I can't say for sure.<br />But getting back to the original movie, I had one more comment, actually a suggestion, for anybody who might be interested in reading an author whose stories have the sort of hopeful, sweetly surrealistic quality of Capra's films, combined with an ironic wit that ranges from gentle to outright vicious. This is author John Welter, and I'd recommend his two books, I Want to Buy a Vowel, and Begin to Exit Here. He has one other novel with the title Night of the Avenging Blowfish, but despite the title, I think the other two are better and would read them first. If you're a Chris Moore, Carl Hiaasen, Tim Dorsey, or Bill Fitzhugh fan also, and are looking for something else, check out these two books by Welter also. He's not as famous as any of the above but deserves to be much better known.edited role in the 1958 film, The Big Country, starring Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, Charles Bickford, Jean Simmons, Burl Ives, and Chuck Connors.

B00005JM1F|3.0|No, there's nothing too original here but I'd say it's worth a rental just to see the wedding band's rendition of 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'.  I must have watched that sequence 20 times before I could stop crying I was laughing so hard.  Will Ferrell does a good job, Vince Vaughn is characteristically annoying, but Luke Wilson seemed to be relegated to playing the straight man for most of the film.

B000099T2L|5.0|ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS BEYONCE IS DESTINY'S CHILD! This girl got down on this album! she is everything that all these other silly female artists want to be. Ashanti lacks her talent, Mya lacks her beauty, and Monica lacks the voice( which she lost ever since her first album). Beyonce and Jay z were perfect for crazy in love. you haters better just suck it up because this girl is gonna be around for a long time. Those other members. what their names? Kelly and Michelle better pray beyonce wants to get back with them cause this girl is on the road to success. She broke it down on VH1's Divas and on saturday night live. The best songs are every song except for the one with Missy elliot and big boi. Missy needs to get her own album in check instead of riding off other artists. The song Speechless is the BEST SONG on the album and her reason for being a star! Dangerously in love part 2 is really good too. The destiny child version is no different than part 2. because on the first one beyonce was singing lead anyway. so no BIG difference. OVERALL THIS ALBUM GETS 5 STARS BECAUSE SHE'S A WHOLE LOTTA WOMAN WITH A LOTTA TALENT! GO BEYONCE!
B00005JLSE|5.0|Usually, I never watch musicals, but \\"Chicago\\" is amazing!  The music, especially, is great.  It's been a long time since a musical this wonderful has been released.  Nobody knew that any of the actors could sing so well, though they had to attend intensive voice lessons before filming.  I loved how they switch periodically from their life(speaking mostly) to their fantasy(singing on stage).  The costumes and stage setting was amazing to look at.  \\"Chicago\\" was well deserving for its six Oscar wins, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress(Catherine Zeta-Jones).  I expected more wins, but that's okay.  This will be a classic years from now!
B00005JM1F|4.0|Mitch (Luke Wilson; Bongwater), Frank (Will Ferrell; Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn; The Cell) are disillusioned with their personal lives begining when Mitch's nymphomanic girlfriend, Heidi (Juliette Lewis; Natural Born Killers), cheats on him, then former party animal Frank gets married, but unwilling to get go of his wild life, and Beanie is a family man seeking to reclaim his wild and crazy youth. Beanie suggests that they form their own fraternity in Mitch's new house on a college campus to re-live their glory days by bringing together a variety of misfit college students, losers, middle-aged and elderly retirees as their new friends and later try to avoid being evicted by the new Dean of Students, Pritchard, whom still holds a personal grudge against all three of them.<br />I heard about this film from a friend, so I tried it, and laughed myself senseless. Will Ferrell is hilarious as a newly-wed numb-skull. Luke Wilson is quite funny himself. But the funniest was Vince Vaughn. I thought his role in this was about as funny as Swingers (in which he was hilarious). As good as the film was, I still couldn't give it the full five stars. It's a hilarious film nonetheless.<br />If you enjoyed Old School, don't forget to check out the following comedies:<br />National Lampoon's Van Wilder<BR>National Lampoon's Senior Trip<BR>How High
0743455967|4.0|As I read this book, i could almost see Stephen King sitting there, mumbling too himself. This book is the voice of a man, talking about his experiences as a developing writer. He offers many tips and valuable advice, and all in a lightfashioned manner that is simply delighting to read. This is not a boring learn-how-write book. This is a journey in the life of an author, and a story in itself.
B00005JKN9|4.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is director Martin Scorsese's monumental epic about that great city and its immigrant population at the time of the Civil War. While it may not quite succeed as Scorsese's masterpiece [ a goal I think was intended], it is nonetheless a well-crafted and compelling movie. Perhaps the failing lies as much with modern American audiences, who, as a whole, are shockingly indifferent to and uniformed about the history of this nation. Dramatic license aside, the film seemed rather accurate to me. <br />The story revolves around a section of the city called Five Points. Two gangs - one composed of recent immigrants and another made of men who were born in America - fought for control of the area. In an opening scene, the `natives' roust the immigrants in a decisive battle. Amsterdam Vallon [Leonardo DiCaprio], a young boy, vows revenge against the natives after his father, leader of the immigrants, is killed in the fight. Fifteen years later, Amsterdam returns to Five Points to find that the leader of the natives, William Cutting [Daniel Day Lewis], now rules Five Points. Amsterdam wisely ingratiates himself with Cutting, who has no idea of the young man's real identity. Cutting takes a genuine liking the Amsterdam, unaware that Amsterdam's real intention is to kill him. All of this is played out against the riots that plagued New York when the Federal government first instituted the draft to provide soldiers for the Civil War. <br />The cast is excellent, the photography is first rate, and the music mesmerizing. The movie seems too long at almost three hours, but I don't know what could have been cut out without making the story weak and confusing. And something makes me suspect that future audiences, perhaps more aware of the French and Japanese cinema influences which are rampart in the movies, will be kinder to it than today's moviegoers. For, despite its seeming flaws, \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a remarkable achievement.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Take these films...Logan's Run (for the hero's ennui), 1984 and Farenheit - 451 (so very very heavy on the F-451), Matrix (for the special effects), and Dark City (for the cinetography), and you have `Equilibrium'.<br />Christian Bale, is a Cleric. A Cleric arrests and kills people who have emotional responses (a la Logan's Run's Sandmen, they even have the same uniforms...). Bale is an excellent mix of Neo (Matrix) and Tom Cruise (he even has the Cruise look) from Minority Report.<br />While the premise is rather weak i.e. emotions and creativity being illegal, punishable by death, citizens are forced to take Prozium, an emmotion suppressant. Any who feel, are exterminated by SWAT-style teams. .<br />The movie is filmed in `blackened color', almost black and white, a la Dark City and Minority Report. Anything in `color' is destroyed (tres symbolic). The first 10 minutes are straight out of Logan's Run but updated (hero kills best friend in line of duty). The populous is surrounded by audio propaganda a la 1984.<br />There is a sad depth when the hero's wife is arrested for `sense offense' because she actually LOVES him, and the portrayal of his emotionless children as products of the state, is absolutely chilling. Death is not remorse, or caring. It is a fast creamation, and a forgotten victim.<br />The best scene, is when Bale realizes his windows are covered with a chromatic, light reducing film. and thears it off to reviel a full color city below him. Very blatantly symbolic, but effective. From there, it is Cruise in Minority report. But much better done. The action sequences are a notch above Matrix. The lighting effects are superb.<br />If you are a fan of any of the films I mentioned, you have to see this movie. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars?- no DTS. And the sound effects would have been much better on my 7.1 system as DTS, than 5.1 Dolby. I didn't buy my Cambridge speakers to be limited to 5.1...
B00005JM09|3.0|Why didn't the T1000 in Terminator 2 simply go back in time to the day before Sarah Conner met Reese and Arnold from the first movie? Why wait \\"ten\\" years? Surely his advanced design would have been no match for Reese and the then unprepared Sarah Conner. It's always bothered me. Same here with T3. We're told John Conner is \\"living off the grid,\\" so SkyNet can't find him. But guess what? SkyNet has a time machine, so who cares if he can be found in 2003? It can send a Terminator after him at any point in time (come on SkyNet...think three-dimensionally!) If SkyNet is so damn adamant about killing John Conner, all it needs to do is send one Terminator after another to the same day in time until the job is done. Better yet, go back in time and kill Sarah Conner when she's a kid, or kill her great-grandfather. All time travel movies have ridiculous plot holes of similar lines, but for some reason I'm less able to suspend belief with the Terminator series. I love the action, Arnold is as cool as always, and you can't go wrong with Clare Danes. But SkyNet is a pretty stupid super-computer.
078322687X|4.0|The story is simple: 5 kids are serving detention on a Saturday Morning. A geek, a goth, a prep, a biker-type dude, and a jock. Through the movie, you meet these characters and slowly, they sort of band together and become friends (hence the name). This movie is all about dealing with your peers, and it tells you that all of your friends don't have to come from the same backround or be just like you. Overall, it's good clean fun!!!
B000024KC2|4.0|This is the version of Slide It In that was released in Europe &amp; Canada only, prior to the US release. This release features Mel Galley &amp; Mickey Moody on guitar with the US version including John Sykes &amp; combinations of Moody &amp; Galley. This version has a more blusey sound with John Lord's organ more prominent than on the US version. Listen to some of the solos as they differ from the one's recorded on the US release. A great hard rock album without all the overproduction. This is what a hard rock album should sound like not the pretty boy bands that call themselves rockers today!

It is so funny, smart, cool, amazing, I love it!!<br />And for about the 6 people in the world who haven't seen it, here's the scoop: It's all about Elle Woods, the cool, beautiful, president of her sorority, Delta Nu, and has the coolest and cutest boyfriend this side of, the USA. But when he dumps her to go to Harvard Law, it's up to Elle to get him back by....what else? Be a law student!!! This movie the greatest film that ever existed!!!!!
B00007GZVR|4.0|The Big Lebowski (Joel Coen, 1998)<br />The Big Lebowski is considered, at least by the users of IMDB, to be one of the best movies of all time (as I write this, it sits at #228 on the top 250). I seem to be not as big a fan of all things Coen as most people; while I found Miller's Crossing, Fargo, and The Man Who Wasn't There brilliant pieces of moviemaking, I was one of those unfortunate souls who found Raising Arizona unwatchable. The Big Lebowski wasn't that bad, to be sure, but it wasn't the laff riot advertised by its many fans, in my opinion.<br />Jeff Bridges (Starman/Jagged Edge) stars as Jeffrey \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski, who suffers a fate common to many of us; someone mistakes him for another guy with the same name. Except it's not a credit card company or a telemarketer doing it, it's a pair of thugs trying to collect on a debt run up by Lebowski's (the other Lebowski, that is) wife (Tara Reid of Return to Salem's Lot, all grown up). In the course of roughing Lebowski (the poorer) up, one of the thugs decides that urinating on the carpet is an effective way of getting someone to pay a debt. So Lebowski (the poorer), urged on by his best friend Walter (John Goodman, in the performance of his career), decides to contact Lebowski (the richer, played by David Huddleston [The Wonder Years/Frantic]) to see if he can get a replacement rug. After all, the thugs meant to urinate on HIS rug. And it all goes downhill from there.<br />Almost every review of this movie points out the many fine performances in here and attributes the movie's greatness to them. Certainly, the performances are fine, but one wonders if those who have said this to be Jeff Bridges' finest work have seen Starman or Jagged Edge; those who have called this Flea's best work have ever seen Dudes or Suburbia; Steve Buscemi's, Reservoir Dogs; Julianne Moore's, Hellcab or Far from Heaven; you get the idea. These are good performances, and some (especially those of Goodman and cameo appearer John Turturro) are great, but almost everyone here has shown themselves capable of this level of work in the past as well. And as we have been given a number of examples of in the past couple of years (In the Bedroom, White Oleander, Traffic, etc.), a number of great performances are all well and good, but if they don't add up to anything do not necessarily make for a great film. Such is the case here. The visual artistry that made The Man Who Wasn't There or O Brother, Where Art Thou? such treats is notably absent here; Coen seems to have opted to make a film that was \\"straight\\" on its surface and all too queer underneath (a technique, it should be noted, that worked exceptionally in Fargo). When it works, it works, when it doesn't, it doesn't.<br />Worth a rental, anyway, but not a keeper like so many other Coen Brothers films. ** 1/2ro) are great, but almost everyone here has shown themselves capable of this level of work in the past as well.

B00005JKOI|3.0|I think you know what I'm talking about. When I say Brat Pack, I'm reffering to the group of kids in THE BREAKFAST CLUB who, after the film debuted, were dubbed this title. Well, some of the brat pack are back in one of my fave Molly Ringwald movies. The plot is kinda dull (once again [as done in many films] the plot is just about a normal high school, the story separating the geeks from the popular kids, you get the picture), but with some of my favorite 80s stars in it, who CAN resist it?????
B0000633T6|3.0|Spy Game (Tony Scott, 2001)<br />Tony Scott has had one of the simply weirdest careers in Hollywood. How a person could switch back and forth between making atmospheric, sexy thrillers (The Hunger, Beat the Devil, and I have the highest hopes for the upcoming Emma's War) to making intelligent action-suspense drama (Revenge, Enemy of the State, I have even higher hopes for his upcoming remake of Man on Fire) to putting out some of Hollywood's shallowest piles of reeking, unbearable crap (Top Gun, Days of Thunder, 48 Hours II) is beyond me. But he hits the mark enough to keep me coming back to see what he's going to do with any given movie.<br />Spy Game, thankfully, falls into the \\"intelligent\\" section rather than the \\"reeking\\" section. (One wonders if this has to do with Scott finally throwing over Tom Cruise and wooing Brad Pitt as his eye candy.)  It was also entirely different than I expected it to be from the previews, usually a good thing.<br />Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is on his last day with the CIA. He gets a tip from a friend in Hong Kong before going to work that one of his ex-operatives, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), has been arrested in China. For what, no one seems to know. Or so they say. As soon as he gets to work, he's pulled into a meeting about Bishop, China, and a whole lot of other things that make him wonder what's going on.<br />All this, however, is a framework for Redford to sit in the meeting and spin tales, both to everyone else there and in his mind, going back over his ten-year relationship with Bishop, from the time they met in Vietnam to their last work together in Beirut, where the two of them split over Bishop meeting and falling in love with a woman (Catherine McCormack [Dancing at Lughnasa/Shadow of the Vampire]). It also offers us a look into Muir's conscience, as he, who has always counseled Bishop that once someone's caught, they should be left to hang, decides whether or not he's going to try and find a way to help Bishop out of the mess.<br />Well-crafted, well-executed, but a bit jarring in places. One assumes a directors' cut would probably help with the continuity, as it does with so many films. What finally got released, though, is certainly worth a rental. A good way to pass two hours. ***e mess.<br />Well-crafted, well-executed, but a bit jarring in places.

0385504209|5.0|I love a good mystery---and this was one of the best---with all the added suspense of hidden clues, secret societies, and people who are not what they appear to be.  The writing was fast-paced, intriguing, and had me breathlessly turning the pages hoping to discover what our hero and heroine were trying to discover---the Holy Grail.  Beginning with a grisly murder at the Louvre Museum, the reader is tantalized by clues hidden in poems, numbers, and various designs.  Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu are never fully developed as characters, but it's all right because in this book, the chase is everything.  The chase to find the Holy Grail and discover its secret is paramount.<br />My only complaint with the book is that it fictionalizes real people and real events and rewrites history in such a way to attempt to undermine Christianity.  While most readers are smart enough to distinguish between fact and fiction, this does plant a lot of innuendo, legend, and rumor masquerading as fact.  My advice is to take it for what it's worth...an exceptionally good thriller...and not to take too seriously its rewriting of historical and Biblical fact. On the upside, this book had me searching websites for factual information moreso than any book I've ever read.  I have also learned more about the works of Leonardo Da Vinci than I ever knew before and finally think I know why the Mona Lisa is smiling.
B00006F7S4|5.0|well i hadnt really listen to beck much before this almub...the only song i really like of becks was \\"loser\\" but i later heard a song on the radio that i really like and it turned out to be \\"lost cause\\"...so i decided to head out and buy the CD because the style of music in this CD seemed to fit my prefrence (radiohead, coldplay) and after listen to all the songs i am glad i bought it...it really is a great CD by beck
B000031WI8|4.0|This is the definitive greatest hits collection for fans of WHAM!  You needn't buy their albums if you get this for all the hits are here.  As a bonus you also get &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; and &quot;A different Corner.&quot;   Two solo efforts on the part of George Michael.  These songs will bring back memories of going to discos, first loves and first times.    I personally fell in love with George , he was my first crush until I discovered Culture Club.  At any rate highly recommended.  Its great to listen to, to dance to and to work out with.  I held back one star by the way for it would have been nice to add a never before released track or some updated version of an old one.  Still, its great!  Now say WHAM! Say BAM!
B000099T2L|2.0|Is it me or does Beyonce seem to \\"scream\\" her way through her songs.  The listener is left wondering if she really can sing because she is SO not exploiting her vocal range (if indeed, she has one).  Nonetheless, she will no doubt do well with this album because with Sean Paul, Jay Z and Luther who wouldn't.  On a lighter note, the first track is very catchy and will be an instant success for her.  For what it's worth Beyonce - well done !!!
B00005Q66T|3.0|This CD is like those Greatest Hits volumes from minor bands, where you get 2 or 3 good tracks and a bunch of stuff you've never heard before and can't stand anyway - the \\"crowd favorites\\" and all that.  For Madonna, it just seems sad sitting on my shelf next to the Immaculate Collection. While that earlier album was complete void of anything less than a mega-hit, yet this record is split into \\"thirds\\" - 1/3 genuine hits, 1/3 mediocere songs, and 1/3 filler from failed singles and \\"experimentational\\" periods.<br />The obviously good songs include \\"Ray of Light\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", and \\"Don't Tell Me\\", a nod to the Britney generation.  \\"Music\\" is a kicking club tune that is even more powerful a few years after I first heard it.  \\"Take a Bow\\" is a wonderful collaboration with Babyface that hints at Madonna's breakup with Warren Beatty. These mature pieces are richer in sound than her eariler work, and they seem to grow better as they age.<br />Then you have the mediocre songs, true minor hits that you rarely hear on the radio anymore, like \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Secret\\", and the \\"Power of Goodbye\\".  I'd throw \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" into this category, because it is definitly a good song that Madonna should be proud of, but it doesn't really fit into the dance-friendly canon of her work.  Even at its release, the famous \\"Erotica\\" felt like a rip-off from her \\"sex\\" period set off by \\"Justify My Love\\", and it certainly doesn't hold up through the years.  <br />Then you have those singles that nobody heard even when they were first released and publized:  \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Drowned Love\\", etc.  A full third of this album is skip-able- they feel more like the artists attempts to pander to her hard-core fans more than music.  \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\" is shockingly bad, considering that Madonna actually gave this song to her *husband* to use in a movie.  <br />Since most of the great pieces here come from Madonna's latest work, there is hope still fora comeback to her former glory years, although if \\"American Life\\" is any indication of Madonna's modern style, I kinda doubt it will happen.

0793518326|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this book has a large number of deficiencies and errors, many of which have been noted in the Amazon.com reviews. Despite this, I have given it five stars because I do not expect anything better to be produced in my lifetime.  There is a huge quantity of accurate information here in a very accessible form at a very small price.  You can get a very good idea of what the book is like by reading the reviews here on Amazon.com.  Basically, most of the songs that the Beatles recorded through Help are transcribed quite accurately.  As the songs became more complex (say Rubber Soul on) some of the transcriptions can be more fairly characterized as \\"sketches.\\"  However, the sketches are some of the best on the market.  Someone wanting more completeness would do well to price school band music where the charts for a single jazz standard run about half the price of this book.  If you have any knowledge of the music publishing industry, you should have a good idea of what it would cost Hal Leonard to make significant improvements or someone else to produce a competing text.  Might as well buy this and make corrections in the margins.
B00006879E|5.0|From seeing them on Carson Daly's show randomly one night, to listening to some of their songs online, to going out and buying the CD, e-mailing Adam (the lead singer) and him e-mailing me back, to seeing them open up for John Mayer, Maroon5 has never let me down. They are so innovative-&quot;neo-soul&quot; music if you will, like nothing I've ever heard in the best way possible. The power that Adam puts behind his vocals combined with the talent from the rest of the band, as well as their awesome personalities (when's the last time you got an e-mail from a famous recording artist?) prove that Maroon5 will soon get the respect they deserve
B00008G9JO|5.0|Based on the current 3 star customer rating this album does not appear to be a generally revered Tull album.  This I do not understand.  All of the tracks are great, and while it definitely takes multiple listens to appreciate this album, the patient listener will find some of Tull's best melodies, most intricate instrumentation, and richest sound.  This is up there with the best of Tull albums.  <br />About the remaster: the sound is very, very crisp, clean, and clear.  Both bonus tracks are excellent, and fit very well with the rest of the album, unlike other bonus tracks on previous remasters.

The story is compelling and different, and the ending will keep you thinking.  <BR>   If anyone tells you the guy in the bunny suit is stupid then they haven't seen this movie because it so important to know who that guy is and the end reveals everything so beautifully and in such a moving way you will need to see it again to figure out what you just saw.<BR>     See it that's the only thing I can say about this movie.

B0000640SA|4.0|Walking into this movie years ago I did not know, fully, what I was getting myself into.  From the first frame to the last I was riveted. The DVD is no exception this is loaded.  <BR>    Anything you want to know about the conception of the movie to the execution.  This movie is different and refreshing.  Granted in the end there is nothing redeeming about anyone in the movie, as a viewer you don't feel cheated or suckered.  Once you see the movie, and you will, you'll know what I mean.
038572179X|4.0|The first thing that should be said about this novel is that anyone who reads it from a position of being able to compare it with the work of similar writers from the past thirty years or so will recognize it as a book that will clearly be discussed well into the future - fifty, or possibly even a hundred years - as representing a clear reflection the thoughts and attitudes of our own time. McEwan balances close psychological description with (dare one say it?) post-modern detachment without ever becoming as ponderous as a Murdoch or as gimmicky as a Barth. The main characters - especially Briony Tallis - are fascinating and fully realized human individuals, and the novel's clever and disorienting shifts of tone and perspective are masterful and never gratuitous or self-congratulatory.<br />That having been said, there's a certain studiedness to it all, and the ending, while very striking and fascinatingly ambiguous, also seems perhaps a little facile in its cleverness, in a way that reminds one of the 'twist' endings of M. Night Shyamalan and David Fincher movies. One worries that this manner of storytelling will come to seem awfully used-up over the next twenty years or so.<br />Still, in the meantime, this novel is simply not to be missed. I read it obsessively over the course of two days and it was only after much careful reflection that its minor shortcomings became apparent to me. How many contemporary authors write works that are even worth thinking about this much?
B0000640VO|5.0|This is what movies strive to be. Magical. Whimsical. Moving. Lovely. Inspiring. Enchanting. Stretch the Limits.

All the faces are recognizable all of the names are known but they are all so different in this one movie. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto , Marlan Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly all transform into their characters and never relent.  Down the spiral of depravity and loss they keep everything sympathetic and real.  <BR>     You may know these people in your life you may have a friend that has this problem.

6305169187|4.0|What is odd, and a little telling about the industry in general, is that this movie was made in 1998 and yet, they don't make movies like this anymore.  Pearl Harbor although made by the same director was really a riff on this one.<BR>    This movie is cheesy and ridiculous in all kinds of ways but it is so good.   It still tear jerking and Michael Bay syle all over it.  Ben Affleck is in his last likeable role and Bruce Willis in his last big hit.  It was back in the day, back in the good ol' 90s.
B00008DDSC|5.0|...I thought it would be dumb with some good sex scenes, for that is what I heard about it.<br />  However I was most pleasently surprised when I saw that SECRETARY was full of real pain and turmoil and longing and pure human emotion. I was so absolutely moved by this movie that I watched it once and then immediatly watched it a second time all the way through, with equal amounts of crying my eyes out at the end, starting at the part where Edward picks Lee up from his desk in her wedding dress. I'll admit I watched the ending about four or five times because I thought it was so beautiful. Everyone should see this movie.Hands down
B000002J09|4.0|I &quot;acquired&quot; this CD today and have already listened to the whole thing twice. It's my first taste of Zeppelin other than hearing some of their lesser works on the radio and I must say that it really IS incredible. I had made the mistake of judging the whole band based on what I'd heard on the radio, which was really dumb of me. What a band releases as radio singles isn't always their best work. Admittably, some songs are better than others. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; are two of the best rock songs I've ever heard, while &quot;Black Dog&quot; can get a bit repatative after a while. However, the whole CD is definately enjoyable. While it may not be the greatest rock album I've ever heard (that honor goes to The Bends by Radiohead), it is certainly a great listen. I heartily reccomend it.
B00005JM09|1.0|This movie supposedly cost 172 million to make.  For that amount one would expect at least a respectable script & cast/direction.  Instead, what we got was a script which seemed written by a 6th grader, and some mis-casts/mis-directions of biblical proportions (e.g., John Connor).<br />In some sense Arnie came out smelling like a rose in this one - he looked like his old self, acted like his old self, etc (which isn't saying he'll win an oscar for best actor, but I'm sure he knows that). The script was just flat out laughable at times, and at least a few times just plain [bad].  A few special mentions: Making John Connor a whining wimp just didn't work, and imho the terminatrix was mis-cast and/or mis-directed also.<br />It wasn't even worth the matinee price...
B00005JM09|3.0|I saw the film two days ago and I thought it was pretty good. I believe that it felt like a sequal to Judgement Day. The movies blended in quite nicley. Unlike The Lost World to Jurassic Park 3 the film stayed true to the other two films. It was scary and a bit gorey. It reminded me of Terminator 2 except newer and better. I like how the movie takes place all in one day. The filming was great and Industrail Light and Magic did an outstanding job with the visual effects. I could tell what was CGI and what was not but it took be a couple of seconds to figure it out. The music was pretty good. Some of the jokes were funny. Stan Winston did an outstanding job with his robots for the film. I know a lot about movies ( believe me) but I don't know if it was a camera trick or a motor in the robots that made them move so fast through that building in the end. <br />Now for the bad stuff. The film's beggining is some what weird. The graveyard scene had to many explosions. It seemed like they wanted it to be really action packed. The story becomes a little hard to follow. Then the thing that ruined the movie the most is the stupid ending. It makes no sense even though he explains exactly what happens you think to your self what a complete waste of time. Other than the stupid ending I think the movie was pretty good. And one more thing I don't really see why it's rated R.
0393057658|2.0|For as much buzz as this book got, I find it to be pretty light on substance. Basically, the premise is that the A's eschew traditional scouting, which is by and large based upon \\"potential\\" and instead look to stats to see how a player has actually performs as measured by stats like walks and on-base percentage.  That's about it.  It's too early in the game to judge if any of the picks or way of doing business here is a success.  I guess if the A's want to run their team like a fantasy baseball team, that's great, but as history has shown although it has given them a competitive team, it has yet to field a great team.  Sure, their GM makes some good trades, but he makes some gobblers too (that don't make it into the book).  Overall, the book did not seem balanced, fair, or even insightful.  A good example is the discussion on Giambi...on how Oakland had to really do it's work to try to replace their premier player who was going to the dark side (the Yankees).  I guess the fact that Giambi was a guy who came up before Billy Beane and was picked by the traditional scouting system wasn't mentioned because it was contrary to what the author is trying to say.  Has Oakland done a good job fielding a team?  Sure...but so has Kansas City, Minnesota, Toronto and Montreal, all with teams that have a comparable payroll to the A's.  I'm guessing in a few years once the current Oakland roster cycles through and they go back to mediocrity you will not be seeing teams hiring stat-nerds to sign players with.At least it was a short, quick read.  My take is that the less you actually know about baseball, the more you will enjoy it, because for the rest of us most of the conclusions are just bunk.  It strikes me that the author knew what the book was going to be before he started and then went out and filtered the \\"facts\\" to support it.    Update 2007  Ok, I can admit where I might be wrong...their record the last several years says they might be onto something...still waiting for them to create a great team at this point. From a read standpoint, it is ok...if you are a baseball fan, you know this stuff by now.  If you are not a baseball fan, you will probably be bored.
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein is a classic. Their sound is much better than NIN and Marilyn Manson combined. Keyboards and guitars will not disappoint you at all in this album. Very dark and amusing. Like Dream Theatre, every sound will amuse you and will make you focus on every second of the music. This is perfect music to be playing in a carnival at night.
0345409671|2.0|Rarely have I ever been so disappointed with a book.  Anne Rice has a rare talent, and it was not apparent here.  I fell in love with the earlier Vampire Chronicles, eagerly read this one when it came out, and felt cheated after completing it.  It felt as though she just blurbed it out onto her computer and sent it straight to her publisher.  It lacks her fantastic descriptive prose; there is far too much dialogue (and inane dialogue it is).  Also, it's too short.  After reading The Vampire Lestat, which Anne clearly put her heart, soul, and a great deal of time into, this one is rushed, choppy, and irritating.  And, I admit, I didn't quite give up on her; when The Vampire Armand came out, I purchased it in hardback and read about 100 pages.  I actually stopped after that, it was so lackluster.  This is very rare for me.  For some odd reason, I decided to give her a try last week.  I read Blackwood Farm, and I was incredibly pleased.  If you haven't read her works, be sure to read The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned; they're both fantastic.  The Tale of the Body Thief was not quite as good, but was still engaging.  Skip Memnoch and Armand.  Read Blackwood Farm.  I'm just starting Merrick, and I'll backtrack to Blood and Gold.  Truly, this is one of the only series I've ever read that actually calls for skipping books.  It really is possible, and it won't leave you as frustrated.  After the first four, others can be skipped, as they are the personal stories of vampires other than Lestat.  Even the Interview with the Vampire can be read out of order.  So, if you've just finished the first four and you're ready to continue, skip this one.  You won't regret it.
B000002JKA|5.0|I have never seen a band like Dream Theatre play with so much effort, ambition, quality, and quantity. They even make the concept of christianity seem interesting and that is definetely something very hard to do nowadays since we all worship the Devil!
B00008977N|1.0|This is a great performance by a really exciting performer backed by a first-rate band. Unfortunately, this DVD contains the worst video transfer I've ever seen, with compression artifacts visible throughout. I'm not crazy about the audio mix, but don't hate it as much as some other reviews I've read. But I think a campaign needs to be started to demand a re-issue of this DVD with the problems fixed.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This is a very compelling story about the Australian Government policy from the early 1900's through 1970 to relocate Aborigine children to orphanages by taking them from their families and their mothers.  What is lacking is the usual guns and bloodshed associated with genocide, but the goal is the same.  To entirely wipe out a culture is the purpose of genocide, and bloodless genocide is no less a crime against humanity.  In the case, the Aborigne culture of Australia is over 40,000 years old and maybe the oldest surviving culture on Earth. Gracie, Daisy, and Molly did not cooperate with this plan of the &quot;master race,&quot; and ran away.  This was the start of a 1,500 mile walk home.  Three little girls knew that if they found the rabbit proof fence that stretched across Australia and headed north, they would end up at home.  This is a stretch of land that is one of the most forbidding on the planet.<br />This is the story about the &quot;lost generations.&quot; Both the trek home and committing this wonderful story of survival against wrong were monumental tasks. Director Phillip Noyce conducted numerous auditions with aborigne girls.  After he makes his selections, he warns them, like any good grandfather, to not get spoiled.  Like other grandfathers, he then proceeds to spoil what seems to be his three adopted grandchildren.  A less kind hearted Director would not be able to pull off what this movie accomplishes.  The special features of the DVD documents how the film crew became like a family, with all of the playfullness, teasing, tears, arguments and making up of a real family (or tribe).  When the scene was shot for the movie of the girls being taken away from their families, there were tears and charged emotions put on film.  When the scene ended and the cameras stopped, the crew had to take a prolonged break because the emotions hadn't stopped.  Aboriginal actresses and acting coaches along with the white crew had to hug and cry all the way out what they had started.  Later, when you see the aborigine girls during informal play  and interaction with others, it is easy to recognize the similarities to the little princess daughter or grand daughter you may have at home.<br />Please don't miss the deeper levels of this movie.  If you look deeper, there is quite a statement within this movie about motherhood, daughterhood, and sisterhood. Perhaps, even a mother nature/earth statement.  A full response to the governments question of intelligence is a challenge to come up with a universal standard.  Is intelligence quotations from Shakespeare while undergoing death by thirst, starvation and elements in the outback?  Or is it squeezing the water from roots of plants, catching, roasting and eating giant lizards or eating beetle larva.  I know exactly whom I want to be with in the outback. It isn't Sydney from Sydney.  It is Gracie, Daisy, and Molly. It is Moodoo, the tracker in this film that is pretending to follow the girls but never quite catching them.  Can you recognize him?<BR>He is the same person that played the Aborigne teenager many years ago in &quot;Walk About.&quot;  He looks like he is in the same physical condition and ready for the next &quot;walk about.&quot;  I really want to see more movies like this highlighting Aborignal culture and the Australian landscape.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie was so sweet. The fight scenes will blow your mind. Even though I hate how action movies always compare themselves to the matrix this one was better than the matrix
B000068R1X|2.0|It does not matter to me at all if this album is remixed or whatever. In recent years it became clear that Ozzy and Sharon just keep doing it for the money. (the atrocious MTV show; the rerecordeds BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN).<br />I think that after Randy Rhoads died, the quality of Ozzy´s career was permantly lost (with the exception of NO MORE TEARS). All of a sudden, he lost not only Rhoads, but bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake, who were replaced by Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge (a personal favorite of Sharon - this was the reason the original line-up split-up). But there was one terrible difference: neither Sarzo nor Aldridge could write songs, while Rhoads, Daisley and Kerslake could offer amazing quantities of quality input into the songwriting process. That´s why Daisley was called back into the fold for BARK AT THE MOON: Ozzy was short of songwriters.<br />Giving his sad loss of Rhoads and the hurry to record another album, BARK AT THE MOON was a noble effort, but nowhere near the two previous masterpieces. JAke E. Lee proved to be a solid L.A. guitarrist (man, in this mix they reduced the volume of his guitar work, mainly the solos! WHy??!!, but it was clear since the start that he would do only what Ozzy (and Sharon) told him to do. <br />I agree to stick with the opinion to stick with the 1995 remaster, but I don´t care. BARK AT THE MOON is just an average album, remixed or not.
B00005JLKB|3.0|This mediocre series boasts the monicker \\"WB's Top Series\\" for one reason - Michael Rosenbaum.  The writing is atrocious and Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and Kirstin Kreuk (Lana Lang) are frequently painful to watch, but Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) garners three stars all on his own in this mishmash of comic canon and WB melodrama.  He makes Lex Luthor sympathetic, likeable and endearing.  Lex's inevitable turn toward darkness is made all the more heart-breaking for the care Michael Rosenbaum takes in making you feel for a man trying to do right by himself, his best friend and a community that has cast him aside.  Alison Mack as Chloe Sullivan, John Glover as Lex's tyrannical father, Lionel Luthor and Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent also shine despite the writers' best efforts to keep them in the shadows.
B000068QZK|2.0|I think anyone who say that this album has great drumming by Randy Castillo (God bless his soul) must be dreaming. The drumming here is the worst of all Ozzy albums, simply as that. IT´s a totally pop-metal drumming, worst still than in THE ULTIMATE SIN.<br />Hearing this Zakk Wylde debut, no one could ever imagine that he would be capable of record NO MORE TEARS after this turkey. NO RET FOR THE WICKED is flat, uninmaginative, cold. THe worst from Ozzy. No wonder it is &quot;forgotten&quot;, like some other reviewer said. I had great doubts deciding which is the worst OZzy album: THE ULTIMATE SIN (Ozzy himself called this album &quot;THE ULTIMATE DIM...)or NO REST FOR THE WICKED.
B000000OAN|5.0|What can you really say about this album that hasn't been said? I'll start with what led up to this album. They released Sheer Heart Attack, previously and it turned some of the heads of the critics. They started to relize that this force called Queen couldn't be stopped, that they would keep pioneering great original music no matter what was said about them. From the beggining Queen was critisized in many ways, their first album was reviewed by a British critic as \\"A Bucket Of [stuff]\\" and most critics continued to slam Queen until this album. When they soon gave Queen some credit. Everything was riding on this album it was going to be a \\"complete failure or a total masterpiece\\"<br />Death On Two Legs - One Of the best openers to any album, the continuation of \\"Flick Of The Wrist\\". Great Song! 9/10<br />Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon - It is a filler to alot of people. I love it, it's just a short fun song. Brilliant for what it is 8.5/10<br />I'm In Love With Car - Never have been a fan of Taylor's voice I only like it when its in contrast to Freddie's voice because combined its great. I still like this one 7/10<br />You're My Best Friend - We can all relate to this beautiful song. Deacon was a brilliant song writer and is way underrated for his contributions. (This song was written for his wife) 9/10 <br />'39 - Really is a beautiful song, isn't too original sounding but it is still a great Brian May song. 8/10<br />Sweet Lady - Pretty average, good song non-the-less 7/10<br />Seaside Rendezous - Maybe it's just me but doesn't this song sound like something you'd hear on Sesame Street? Still its a good fun song and it will get stuck in your head 7/10<br />Prophet's Song - Give this one a few listens it's very different (like most of Queen) Brian May, gem maybe overlooked by Freddie's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" but it definatley holds its own with it on this album. 9.5/10<br />Love Of My Life - Beautiful, It's one of the greatest ballads ever written! 10/10 <br />Good Company - Great song with great vocals. 7.5/10<br />Bohemian Rhapsody - Yeah, you really can't say anything about this one except words of Perfection... 10/10 <br />God Save The Queen - Great way to end the album (no rating needed)<br />One of the greatest albums of all time. Queen made alot of great albums and I couldn't say which is their best or my favourite. If there was any album I'd give to someone to introduce them to Queen, It would be this one.
B000070WJE|5.0|You can say lots of things about Robbie Williams, but none the less he's one of the best musicians I've heard in the last time.<BR>This album is new, different and various, but oh so Robbie Williams. If you liked his former albums you will love this. From tender tunes to powerful sounds - there's some for everyone. And not to forget his humorous talents.

0156421178|4.0|Between the World Wars of the 20th century, there was another devastating conflict on European soil that attracted participants from all over.  It was the Spanish Civil War, and while internal dissatisfaction and agitation were breaking out around the country, Spain also became a proving ground for broader political ideologies.  In 1937, George Orwell went as a journalist but the socialist siren song of the promise of bringing about a classless society drove him, as well as others from abroad, to enlist.  He signed up with P.O.U.M., the party for Marxist unification but  quickly learned that there were many similar political parties and labor unions, each with their own woefully unprepared militia, and none were working together against the threat of Franco's military coup and Fascism.  He also found the Communists arriving, not to assist revolution but to thwart it.<br />With a clear eye that catches remarkably prophetic insights into the Spanish future, Orwell manages to sort out the chaos of who's who, and the nuances of war that are sometimes awful, sometimes fertile ground for wry humor.  Although the voice of the narrative is in memoir form, Orwell was writing only from a distance of 5 or 6 months after he escaped. The book is remarkable for the immediate eye-witness account of the turn of fortunes in Barcelona and the objective sorting out of events that were not being accurately recorded in the media.  Orwell expresses deep respect for the native Spanish character, even when some of its inefficient tendencies produce frustration.<br /><br />My edition, which I purchased here last year, but which looks different from the cover above, offers an introduction by critic Lionel Trilling written in 1952, two years after Orwell's death from TB.  It, too, is also a historical document now, preserving the sense of the ruling emotions of the era.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I was wanting to buy a really good metal cd one day.  I didn't know what I wanted, so I went on this site and found that a lot of people seem to liked this album.  I heard a couple songs from their previous cd and liked them a lot.  I hadn't heard anything from this album yet but i saw it cheap and picked it up.  I must say that they have improved a great deal.  The production is amazing here, thanks to devin.  The cd sounds raw but at the same time, it's VERY LOUD.  probably the loudest cd i own, besides Reinventing the Steel by Pantera.  <br />Their singer has improved a great deal.  He doesn't do his high pitched scream as much and opted for a more death metal voice, although it isn't really death metal.  The guitar players have also gotten better, the riffs are more complicated and thought out.  The drums sound a lot better too.  Can't hear the bass but 99.99% of other metal bands have that same problem so I won't complain. <br />This cd is only a little over 37 mintues long so you can listen to the whole thing in one sitting and actually want to come back for more.  <br />Easily one of the best albums of 2003, by any band, metal or not. GET THIS NOW!!!!
B000092ZYX|4.0|First off, Radiohead is my favourite band and have been since their first album.  The band's own blacklisting of \\"Creep\\" (a runner-up in many critic's minds to Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the 1990's top adolescent anthem) is misunderstood by many, though arguably so. Imagine being liked for one song.  At least Pearl Jam is liked for their album Ten.  Both Radiohead and Pearl Jam have, as Fat Boy Slim would say,come along way baby!  <BR>   The Bends was their first good album - the most listenable alt. rock masterpiece for the masses.  Songs like Fake Plastic Trees, High'n'Dry, Just, Bulletproof and Street Spirit, who could go wrong? We saw a band go from single to album, and then came O.K. Computer, the most critically acclaimed album by this band to date.  It was a delightful surge into a more polished, dynamic and mature direction for all music, ordaining electic and electronic.  Beautiful songs like Exit, Lucky, Let Down found themselves aquainted with Floydesque efforts like Paranoid Android, ironically yet comically their first single. This was a departure from alternative music - Radiohead had become a new messiah for music,though not many have followed in that direction...a sad reality that maybe is a blessing disguise.  Becoming more obsure has made Radiohead more popular, something not as common as one would think.  <BR>   Kid A wasn't as successful but in my opinion a much better, confident brother of O.K. It flows so well from start to finish, whilst still adhering to the same recipe that O.K. first cooked up.  Songs like Everything...Right Place, National Anthem, How to Disappear, and Idioteque stand out.  With that said, the song Kid A which at first seems meaningless except for bearing the album's title eventually clicks after many listens... this can be said for all of new Radiohead.  Don't send in a review after a couple of listens - they are too complicated and crafted for such a mismeanor. Maybe you can do this for other acts but Radiohead is to music as David Lynch is to movies.  Dark, lost, confusing, humourous, tragic, but always leaving you with food for thought, and NOT for everyone.<BR>   Amnesiac came out promising, proclaiming to sound more \\"Poppy\\" like the Bends which was not accurate.  Even Knives Out which has many pop hooks, does throw in the odd flat and lost note to keep the music interesting. The songs did sound like those recorded during Kid A.  The music is as every bit good but the flow is not.  From the mind-numbing classic murmuring \\"I'm a reasonable man get off my case\\" to the final number reminiscent of N'Orleans, the music is intellectual, and complex but does sound like it was thrown together as a play list.  Pyramid Song done in a strange time arrangement to the build-up at the end of You and Who's Army, the music is stellar. Pull/Pulk wasn't as good as Kid A as what many would call the 'filler' and Spinning Plates was grating compared to the live version off of I Might Be Wrong (another classic song). <BR>   So now we finally get to Hail to the Thief.  It boasts great lyrics which had been slipping according to some since OK.  Its opener 2+2=5 is aggressive and varied, great unusual guitar chords, finishing much different than it stared. Sit Down Stand Up is also very commanding and melodic.  Then it flows or shall I say sails(and it is sailing to this point) to the sombre, beautiful ballad Sail to the Moon. Like How to Disappear and Exit, it is lost yet tranquil and dreamy. Backdrifts, is the start of the 'disunity'.  It is an average song at best and it hints of more of an electronica edge to flow. Go to Sleep is a pick-me-up and goes along with the first three songs.  Where I End, a riveting, on the edge of being haunting also retrieves the flow effect.  We Suck Young Blood comes out of nowhere.  I think a weaker song - like the slow clapping but it doesn't quite build up enough.  Maybe it was Yorke's intention as an ear tease but it doesn't work for me.  The Gloaming to me isn't an effective song either.  I would rather have Kid A or Pulk in there. It has reached the point of annoying for me which is hard for any Radiohead song to do. There There, the single though like all the first singles of their previous albums (Paranoid Android, Optimistic, Pyramid Song) it isn't very radio friendly especially when sandwiched between Audioslave and Sum 41. It is, however, an excellent song.  I Will, though slow does have a place on this album.  A Punchup and its successor Myxomatosis (similar to a National Anthem) are great 'different' songs - though out of place on the album in my opinion.  Scatterbrain, next to Sail to the Moon is probably the most beautiful song and serves as a good set-up man for the closer.  A Wolf at the Door doesn't work here in my opinion.  Compare this to Street Spirit, the Tourist, Motion Picture Soundtrack... it is a departure, a risk maybe but the 50 cent Oxford-style rap makes an interesting song but not for this album. I felt this way with ...Glass House from Amnesiac too.  Interesting yet not you, Thom, and the boys!  <BR>   So I believe that this album has brilliance but it should have done what the other albums did - choose 11 songs instead of 14.  Dump The Gloaming, A Wolf at the Door, We Suck Young Blood and make a few re-arrangements and then a better flowing album.  Therefore 5 star quality but 4 star results... I guess that is why they have a little button on every stereo called a 'SKIP' button. All said and done, it is really easy to criticize everyone else.  I'm just happy that these guys still making music. As a drummer and guitarist, these guys are trying to eliminate the boundaries of four simple chords.  And for every failure, there are ten successes.  Keep pushing the envelope boys.<BR>   In conclusion, see these guys live.  They are mesmerising and Thom's presence is similar to the critic's view of Exit (For A Film) - haunting yet beautiful...

0671042858|5.0|Wow!  This is my first Stephen King read and I absolutely loved it!  I picked this book up through one of the book orders at STMS in Herculaneum.  I really loved this book.  King tampers with my emotions enough to make this book a keeper.  I think reviewers who were disappointed with this book were avid King readers, and may have anticipated more from him.  It's refreshing when an actor can adapt to different roles on the screen, so it is also fantastic that King is able to cater to the needs of varying readers.<br />  Trisha McFarland is a 9 year old girl who is very ordinary in many ways.  She is tired of her mother and brother bickering, tired of being ignored, tired of being taken for granted.  When she slips out of sight of her family, Trisha soon realizes that she may as well have been forgotten.  Lost in the deep forests of Northeastern America, Trisha must rely on her instincts, courage, and imagination to keep her alive.<br />  King practices so many qualities that I look for in an author.  His use of description is satisfying.  He reminds me so much of Ray Bradbury in his descriptive style.  King uses symbollic and imaginative descriptions that stir emotional reactions in the reader making the story very real and personal.<br />  King's ability to balance readers and characters on the narrow line between sanity and insanity is tendered by his use of suspense, and stretching the limits of the hero's endurance. He tests our tolerance for his slow and deliberate taxing of a well designed character.  It drives me crazy  to think about a ten year old girl surviving many of the things Trisha had to survive.<br />  Finally, King keeps things very real.  There is nothing in this story that could not haunt the rest of us forever because of its solubility in reality.  I don't think I've read anything more satisfying for a while.  Each barrier Trisha faces is believeable.  Her mental interpretations of these realities is reasonable even when she starts hallucinating.<br />  I fell in love with Trish McFarland as a character because she is strong, courageous, and creative.  She is a fighter and a survivor.  She is the kind of girl that inspires me to be a better teacher because she is strong and confident, always looking for ways around obstacles instead of letting them be excuses for her not to learn  or improve.  Too bad more kids can't be like that.<br />  So why realease such a fantastic book? ... Hey I'm keeping my copy!  Eventually I want it hard bound.  I'm releasing copies of this one to people who inspire me.  It is truly a practical book for a controlled release.  I'm excited to read what others have said about this book.  I know it must have been a popular title. King has always been a popular author.  Now I know why.g.  <BR>   I fell in love with Trish McFarland as a character because she is strong, courageous, and creative.  She is a fighter and a survivor.

B00005JKHP|3.0|10 years following the cancellation of Gene Roddenberry's sci-fi television series, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, fans of the show (that aired for only 3 years between 1966 and 1969) were elated to learn that the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast had been reunited for a 2-hour feature film.  The much anticipated film, entitled &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, was placed under the direction of probably one of the best directors of all time, Robert Wise, who had previously won two Oscars for Best Director for the films &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965).  He also edited the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and directed &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971).  However, even with such an impressive director at the helm, long-time &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, as well as the rest of the audience, were not particularly impressed with the film.  Why?  The primary cause was poor writing, but Robert Wise may not have been the best choice for director either.  And what of the writers?  Though not credited, Gene Roddenberry was involved with writing the story, but the film's story was credited to Alan Dean Foster, who started writing sci-fi novels in 1972, but had no previous film or television writing experience.  Other writing credits go to Harold Livingston, whose previous writing experience was primarily for television shows, but he had never written anything for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.  Additional non-credited writing was done by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.<br />The story itself begins as follows: a massively large cloud emerges from unknown regions of space and is first detected by the Federation when it passes through Klingon space and is attacked by three Klingon warships.  The Klingons are destroyed, and the cloud is found to be heading directly for Earth.  Conveniently, with no other starships available to intercept the massive cloud, only the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is nearing the completion of its redesign, is in range to intercept the cloud.  The now Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) easily convinces Star Fleet Command to give him command of the Enterprise, even though a new captain has already been assigned, Captain William Decker (Stephen Collins).  (Capt. Decker is the son of Commodore Matthew Decker, who died in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode, &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, which aired on October 20, 1967.  In that episode, Commodore Decker was played by William Windom.)  Most of the original crew is already on board the Enterprise, including Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Lt. Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), the now Dr. Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett, who married Gene Roddenberry) and the return of Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney), who was removed by producers during the first season of the original series.  Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is drafted back into Star Fleet at the behest of Kirk, but Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has been busy purging all emotions on Vulcan for several years.  A new alien crew member is introduced in the film, Lt. Ilia (Persis Khambatta, who got to shave her head for the role.)  From that point on, much of the film is essentially a rework of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode &quot;The Changeling&quot;, which aired originally on September 29, 1967.  The subplot between Capt. Decker and Lt. Ilia is very interesting and should have received greater attention.<br />The most memorable scenes in the film include the transporter accident, McCoy's arrival on the Enterprise, Spock on Vulcan, the Klingons' battle with the cloud, the arrival of Lt. Ilia, the worm hole, Spock's arrival, the Enterprise's first cloud encounter, the probe, Spock's space-suited journey, Kirk's challenges to V'Ger and the final bridge scene.  The two worst scenes in the film are both lengthy and have very little dialog: Kirk's lengthy external tour of the Enterprise and the psychedelic cloud light show reminiscent of the final scenes from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968).  Acting in the film was certainly not stellar, and was often rather emotionless and uninspired.  The best acting came from Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, the Klingon Captain (Mark Lenard, who usually played Spock's father Sarek in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; projects) and James Doohan.  Other notable characters include Sonak (Jon Rashad Kamal) and the female Vulcan Master (Edna Glover).  One thing that this film forever changed was the appearance of the Klingons who have the now familiar ridged foreheads.  In the original television series, they appeared far more human.  Special effects used in the film may seem dated to some viewers, but were quite good for the time.<br />Overall, I rate &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; with 3 out of 5 stars.  It certainly could have been much better, but it's not a complete waste of time.  Had more of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series writers been involved with this film, it probably would have been far more memorable and enjoyable.  At least the DVD version includes many deleted scenes.  These scenes help to explain the story and should probably have remained in the original film.
0876855575|1.0|this was my first charles bukowski book and it is unlikely i will go back for seconds. the writing is unimaginative and there is no character developement whatsoever. the main character, henry chinaski, has no redeeming qualities. his childhood is not that much different from most except for the severity of his acne problem. his response to that childhood is chronic violence and alchoholism. he literally becomes what he detests and is even worse. if this is supposed to be a coming of age novel like catcher in the rye, it falls miserably short. holden caulfield is searching for something and has positive intentions. chinaski has none of this....

0375414053|5.0|I really loved this book.  First, it was very funny.  While I found it sad in parts, I didn't see it as an indictment of working mothers or a negative work overall.  I think there is something there for all moms.  What stay at home mom can't identify with a seconds matter lifestyle (showering, grocery shopping and cleaning in 1 hr 45 minutes between feedings), or how ridiculous competitive child rearing has become?  What working mom can't identify with feeling like there is yet another thing you should be doing but are not?  All the wit of Bridget Jones with a more serious theme....
B00008973Q|5.0|This is, quite possibly, the greatest Japanese movie ever made.  <BR>The late, great Kurosawa was, and is, the primer filmaker of modern-day Japanese cinema.  <br />This take of Shakespeare's King Lear is full of heart wrenching betrayal, unrequited loyalty, and a bloodlust for power.  With a film score by the peerless Toru Takemitsu and the hawk-eye of the wonderful Asakazu Nakai, Ran tells the tale of a old king, abdicating his throne to his three sons, who then squabble over the remains of the kingdom.  Set in fedual Japan around the 17th centuary, I assume, Ran is a masterpiece any gormand of Japanese cinema should at least once.  Multiple times if you can afford it.
B00005KHJR|5.0|There aren't many movies like Wicker Man. It's not horror, it's not too intellectual, there's probably a lesson to be learned, but who know's what? A lot of questions stick in your head, like:<BR>How did apparently conservative actors get cast for this?<BR>Is there something about old English paganism we haven't really thought through (one for the modern Stonehenge Druid wannabes)?<BR>Was there any SCPC (or Royal SPCA) oversight on this movie, especially in the last scenes, which I shall not describe?<BR>This is a viscerally disturbing movie, and if you get the longer version, which I recommend, you'll love it even more. <BR>It has the classic 70's opening, with bland theme music and the promise of a stodgy police caper, and doesn't really nail you until the pub scene, when the otherwise normal locals join in a bawdy song about banging the innkeeper's daughter. The police investigator's reaction is great. And gets better when he sees the little episode behind the hedges ... but I've said too much already. <br />But I've said too much.
B0000062GK|5.0|Don't let the old school Satch fans fool you: this CD blows Surfing with the Alien out of the water.  Each track is good enough to be someone's favorite.  Personally, I am APPALLED that only ONE person out of the 80 or so reviewers picked Trundrumbalind as the album's finest track... a good song should be able to coax a feeling or two out of the listener.  The commonly overlooked Trundrumbalind is captivating and downright inspiring.  This is the finest 13 bucks you will ever spend.
B00008OLYN|1.0|Opeth did something different this time around. Like many good bands, and failed miserably, like many good bands. Deliverance came out around the same time, and its SO much better. Although Deliverance isn't REALLY heavy, its a lot heavier than this. Damnation is very acoustic and soft, and BORING. Seriously, go buy My Arms, Your Hearse, or Deliverance.
B000000WCA|5.0|I remember the first time I heard Wannabe on the radio -- I was hooked.  In 8th grade at the time and looking for style and attitude, I found it in these five wonderful young girls.  Emma (Baby Spice), Mel C (Sporty Spice), Victoria (Posh Spice), Geri (Ginger Spice), and Mel B (Scary Spice) all had distinct personalities and their music was fun and exciting.  They were the biggest thing in Britain since the Beatles, and it didn't take long for them to conquer the rest of the planet, including the picky USA.  This album is a classic, and I think everybody should have it in their collection.  More memorable than any other Spice album, it will truly make an impression.  Here's the play by play for this album, \\"Spice\\":    Wannabe:  Tell me whatcha want, whatcha really really want -- Wannabe Wannabe Wannabe!  Who hasn't heard this song?  Of course, we all had our own made-up versions of the rap break, all with different words and different styles.  If you haven't heard this song, it's the perfect girl-power, good-timey, happy and perky thing, coated with spice and sugar as well.  Each of the girls gets their own section to sing and Geri and Mel B battle on the rap intro, with Mel C shouting 'hu'!  Arguably their best song ever, \\"Wannabe\\" is a classic radio tune and can still be heard today.  10/10    Say You'll Be There:  If I'm not mistaken, this single actually outsold \\"Wannabe\\" (and \\"Wannabe\\" was #1 in 32 countries!).  This began the heigth of the girls' careers and in this song each girl got an identity, with Emma as Kung Fu Candy and Geri as Trixie Firecracker etc.  The girls, having firmly made their own real-life identities well known by this time, played with them to create even bigger alter-egos.  Not as hyped or as loud as \\"Wannabe\\", \\"Say You'll Be There\\" was a bit slower but didn't lack for in-your-face lyrics.  Another classic with a harmonica solo, it's still fun and spunky.  10/10    2 Become 1:  With this song, the boys could like it and that's what helpedmake it so big.  This was the first big ballad the girls did, and it helped make them bigger as singers and not just celebrities.  They could actually show off more of their vocal talent than just vamp around singing short and sweet lyrics.  Highlights of this song are the string arrangement and the chorus, which is soulful but not shrewd.  A very nice love song with an important part for every girl, \\"2 Become 1\\" was another #1 for the Spices.  10/10    Love Thing:  A lot of people didn't care much for this song, but what made it good was the rap done by every girl in the bridge section.  A bit more disco but not any less spicy, the girls make it clear in this song that they aren't playing around.  Though this song was never the best concerning instruments, it still makes its mark.  9/10    Last Time Lover:  I always thought this song was one of the best, simply because Mel B sings very low in it, which makes it a sexy and va-va-voomish type song.  Another fun thing about this song is the chorus, in which they sing \\"do you think I'm really cool and sexy?\\"  Very fun, very Spice Girls-ish.  Instrumentally I like the guitars in this song.  10/10    Mama:  Aww, a song for their mommies.  Who hasn't done a song for those special ladies?  This song also went to #1 and gave the girls a deeper side as apposed to their craziness.  Like \\"2 Become 1\\", this song has some beautiful string sections, which makes it a lovely ballad.  9/10    Who Do You Think You Are:  Now THIS is a classic disco type song.  Complete with quick lyrics and a raspy singing Geri, this song is just plain fun with warped guitars and fast paced brass.  The video, with it's crazy and colorful presentation, helped define the girls' individuality that much more.  10/10    Something Kinda Funny:  Originally set to be the girls' first single, this tune has a sensual disposition hidden within jazzy music and soft teasing vocals.  It's simple, stylish, and catchy.  Despite it's appeal however, it's much more mature than \\"Wannabe\\", and while that doesn't make it any less good, it's not nearly as fun.  However, it's nice to hear the girls taking a different approach. 9/10    Naked:  After seeing this song title, two words came to mind: Janet Jackson.  But it is hardly anything shrewd and actually portrays a very thought-provoking concept.  I would actually call this the most soulful song on the entire album.  It's beautifully written, wonderfully sung and simply emits maturity.  Stylistically, it falls somewhere between a spanish ballad and a jazzclub number.  10/10    If U Can't Dance:  The Spices close out their debut in grand style with this fantastic dance number!  With a sliding bassline, raps by both Mel B and Geri (rapping in Spanish), and a great beat, many have called this their favorite track on \\"Spice\\".  It leaves you wanting more.  10/10    Normally, I'm not a big fan of albums with only 10 tracks on them.  But somehow, it works for the Spices, helping the public to remember not to take them too seriously.  It really gives off the impression that the girls are in it for a good time, and that perfectly compliments their carefree and infectious personalities.  The album clocks in at around 40 minutes total, but that's okay, because you can just listen to \\"Wannabe\\" again sooner.
0679722610|5.0|This was the first novel featuring Hammett's short story character, The Continental Op, and it's well worth reading.  The Op is sent from his home in San Francisco to Personville, Montana on the request of a client.  The fact that Personville is pronounced posionville by its residents will tell you the kind of town he enters.  The violence is so bad that the Op never actually sees his client alive, but he sticks around to avenge his death.  The deep plot is as convoluted as any detective novel, but the basic plot of a man playing two sides against each other proved to be important in the history of film even more so than literature.<br />The Op was the original Man With No Name.  Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western borrows both the stranger concept and the plot from Red Harvest.  Though the credit is usually given to Akira Kurosawa for his film Yojimbo, both films actually borrow their essence from Hammett.<br />It's not necessary to have seen either film to enjoy this story.  Overshadowed by the classic Maltese Falcon, Red Harvest deserves more ink than it gets.  It's here with Hammett that the noir detective novel was born.  The romantic notion of a poor detective who would rather live up to his own standards of justice than take a big payoff is a very American outlook.  I can only figure that such a character comes from the many assignments that Hammett got working for the Pinkerton detective agency and the many times that Hammett wasn't allowed to do the right thing.  Our detective is so virtuous under the standards of his own ethics that you admire him even when he is creating a bloodbath.<br />The most surprising thing is how well the whole book flows and quickly I read it.  Hammett has a great way of leaving each chapter with enough questions that you want to immediately read the next one.  He'll leave you with the conclusion of a boxing match and with a fighter that falls over with a knife in his back.  How can you go to sleep on a chapter like that?<br />Any fan of detective novels and film noir should do themselves the justice of reading all the Hammett they can get.  Red Harvest is a good start to that goal.Any fan of detective novels and film noir should do themselves the justice of reading all the Hammett they can get.  Red Harvest is a good start to that goal.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary is an unconventional love story involving Lee (Maggie Gyllenhall) and her employer, Mr. Grey (James Spader). Lee is a troubled young woman with an alcoholic father and a desire to inflict pain on herself (something she has done since the 7th grade). After spending some time in an instution she attends a community college and then seaks employment and is hired by Mr. Grey as his secretary.<br />This leads Lee into the journey from darkness into light. Although what she considers light is not the most conventional. She takes pleasure in pain, spanking and obeying any order that Mr. Grey gives her. But, at the same time, the movie was able to keep a softness and caring surrouding the two as they traveled down this road together.<br />I found the acting to be amazing and, despite several minutes of boredom towards the end of the movie, I greatly enjoyed the movie and it is one of my new personal favorites.
B00006HBUB|2.0|Scooby-Doo is mercifully short - at only 83 minutes - which is probably the best thing that can be said about it.  Whatever the director and producers were trying to achieve by bringing Hanna-Barbera's classic cartoon to life, it's fairly safe to say they failed.  Despite excellent character interpretations by Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini as Shaggy and Velma, the fleshing out of the Mystery Inc. team is disappointingly shallow.  As is the irritating mission of self-discovery and angst each character goes through before discovering that (surprise, surprise) teamwork is best.<br />The film could be forgiven many of its foibles if only it was rib-ticklingly hilarious.  Unfortunately it suffers from trying to cater both to a young audience, and also to adults who fondly remember the cartoon from their childhood days.  Rowan Atkinson is cringingly unfunny as the strange proprietor of Spooky Island amusement park, and surely even kids are by now impervious to fart and snot jokes.  However, the sequence inside the spooky abandoned castle raises a few hearty chuckles.<br />The trademark unlikeliness of the situations Mystery Inc. got themselves into in the cartoon doesn't transfer well into realism.  The plot, which has a number of large holes, concerns the mysterious change in behaviour of college students who are holidaying at the resort of Spooky Island.  And, it has to be admitted, that thanks to some great sets and the wonders of CGI, the resort looks like a pretty cool place to spend a vacation.  The construction of the theme park has awakened some ancient (and quite scary, considering the PG-rating) monsters, so it's up to the team to unmask the villain and save the world.  But the best way of saving yourself is to avoid watching this movie.

B000002U9W|5.0|It's true Atom Heart Mother is quite artful and the art brings out a definate beauty. It took me a few listens to get used to the album but now it has become a floyd favorite for me. Listening to floyd from before 1970 and not liking it may drive you away from giving this album a chance. Don't be fooled this album is a true highlight in any collection.<br />1.Atom Heart Mother-I enjoy instrumentals and I found this one trully interesting. I mean not many people can say i sat down and listen to a song that was a half hour long. One part leads into the next beatifully, and if you trully love pink floyd you will listen to this the whole way through.<br />2.If-Not to bad of a song. A typical Waters song I thought. The guitar is very nice and perfectlly played out. The lyrics are very pretty as well.<br />3.Summer of '68-I enjoy Wright's songs. They are peacful. This song is the definitive of that peacfulness. It puts you in a good mood.<br />4.Fat Old Sun-Ilove this song!! It was my first favorite on the album. It pictures a beautiful summer evening. This song also puts me in a good mood.<br />5.Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast-People conplain how they do not enjoy this one. The seperate peices are actually very good, it reflects the talent of the band as a whole.<br />This is a Pink Floyd album that can be enjoyed by Sid Barret Lover's and Post Dark Side of The Moon fans. I suggest you Pick it up.
B00005JM09|5.0|I was very excited to see this movie and I was not disapointed at all. It has loads of action from beginning to end, more than T2. The story is about the same as T2, but this time, we see the rise of the machines and how this war between man and machines started. Even if the movie has a different director and Linda Hamilton does not appear in it, the actors are very good and Arnold's performance is one of the best in his career. The visual effects are awesome and very good, better than most movies I saw recently. If you like a lot of action and you liked the first and second one, you're gonna like this one.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I think this album is one of the best and most creative albums of the year by far. With band members from another outstanding group (At the drive in and Sparta) they have really evolved into an awesome new untapped kind of music, I really think that these guys are music genius's. This is a must have of any music lover.
B00005JKN9|3.0|I did not see this movie at the theater, so may have lost some of it's impact on the small screen, but overall found it very enjoyable, if at times, very violent.<br />Any movie over over two and a half hours long, that keeps your attention this well (and makes you feel like it was 90 minutes long) can't be all bad, but I don't rate it that highly. The rear of the box says \\"Over 135 critics agree - film of the year\\" and this I have to disagree with.<br />Performances are strong - Lewis, who is particularly villianous, is ably supported by DeCaprio as well as a host of good cameo's and the storyline is very good. My main criticism would be weakness of DeCaprio in building his character, and the almost superfluous role of Ms Diaz as the love interest. The beginning of the movie has Liam Neeson and Lewis in a rival gang face off in old New York, arguing over the immigrant Irish Catholicism versus the American locals in extremely violent and graphically depicted fashion, which sets up the story in an excellent way. We are then transported 16 years forward to see Neeson's son (DeCaprio) emerging from a correctional home for boys, and setting about avenging his father, and rebuilding his Irish claims to residency. Unfortunately as we proceed through the movie, you can't help feeling that Neeson would have been the better man for the role, as DeCaprio just doesn't come across as believable in my mind, and looks too polished. Great direction by Scorsese, and even if it is allegorical in character, it really does give you an idea of the struggle and brutality of the early history of the great city. This is not a bad movie by any means, but it isn't a \\"Great\\" movie either. It's just become like so many that are over hyped for so long, or have been overladen with Oscars and awards - you the viewer come to expect much much more than you get. If you'd never heard of this movie and rented it out by chance, you'd probably give it 5 stars, as it is - it only gets 3 in my book.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This Cd features tons of new stuff from Radiohead.  They used a lot of computer generated sounds, a very different experience.<BR>1. \\"2+2=5\\" (8/10) This is a rather good song, it have a slow melody at the start and accelerate to a blistering pace near the middle.  A very good opening for this CD.  <BR>2. \\"Sit Down. Stand Up\\" (5/10) one of the worst songs of this cd.  It's got a lot of repeats of lyrics at the end.  It gives me feeling that it's a repeat of the first song.    <BR>3. \\"Sail to the Moon\\" (9/10) This song is one of my favorites.  It talks about his view on the president in the verse \\"maybe you'll be president, but know right from wrong.\\"  This song has a great piano melody through out the whole song.<BR>4. \\"Backdrifts\\" (10/10) this is my second favorite song.  It has a lot of digitally created sounds.  <BR>5. \\"Go to Sleep\\" (11/10) Definatly the best song in the entire album; it's got a tri-guitar melody in the background.  It stars out rather fast and slows down at the end.<BR>6. \\"Where I End and Where You Begin\\" (8/10) This song is kind of weird at the start, but this is an awesome song once you take a few more listens.<BR>7. \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" (2/10) this song is really creepy, I hate it, it gives the creeps.<BR>8. \\"The Gloaming\\" (7/10) This song has a lot of computer generated sounds that have a lot of bass.  The lyrics are one of the weirder ones in the whole album.<BR>9. \\"There There\\" (10/10) this song was selected to represent this CD, you call see its music video on mtv.  One of the best song in this entire CD.<BR>10. \\"I Will\\" (9/10) this is a slow and a rather sad song. Thom had a great emotional delivery for this song. <BR>11. \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\" (9/10) There's really nothing wrong with this song.  It an all around good song.<BR>12. \\"Myxomatosis\\" (7/10) this is the weirdest song in this entire CD.  I believe that's a keyboard with a lot of bass in the background.  The part where Thom sings this verses \\"I don`t know why I feel so tongue tied\\" is really cool.<BR>13. \\"Scatterbrain\\" (5/10) this song doesn't do anything special, so it sucks.  It's pretty boring song compare to Myxomitosis.<BR>14. \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" (10/10) this is the coolest song.  It has a blistering tempo through out the whole song.  Everything except for the chorus is half sang half rapped. <BR> I give this CD a 5 out of 5.  This is a very different collection of rock song from the all other popular rocks.
B00009RDG9|4.0|I saw this movie one day after it's cinematic release, and was suprised at the opening 15 minutes then (current affairs had us in the middle of the Iraq invasion), and wondering if this is the reason behind the long wait to go from screen to DVD.<br />Del Toro plays a \\"Black Op's\\" type of military specialist, who (it later transpires) was an A student of civilian instructor Tommy Lee Jones, in the deadly art of assassination among other things. Without giving too much away, Del Toro (constantly haunted by his military past) appears to have gone off the deep end, and all suspicions point to his involvement in some brutal murders. This is a cue for Tommy Lee to be dragged from retirement as the \\"only man\\" who can find him, and ultimately hunt him down. I don't think it's too much to say that the opening sequences in this movie are harrowing, and the whole subject matter is more than a little disturbing, and please - this movie is NOT for kids, even younger teenagers. The hunter/hunted action makes up the bulk of the film, and one can't help drawing comparisons with movies like US Marshals, and The Fugitive, but this is very different, and I believe much better. Del Toro is not a \\"good guy\\" being persecuted and chased wrongly, and we aren't looking for a conspiracy theory or gang of corrupt politicians to blame, and this adds much more believability and tension to the plot. Jones is very good in this \\"non governmental\\" role and is very believable in his demonstrated expertise, but Del Toro is the real star of the picture in my mind. He is cold, calm and brooding, killing without fear or conscience, whilst still fighting his inner demons. Direction is slick and inventive, and the locations used are breathtaking. This is a very very good movie, if you can endure the extremely graphic violence, and subject matter. Enjoy

You laugh loudly (nay! guffaw--with unappealing horse-like overtones if you're like me) when you read it, sure.  <BR>But you laugh months or even years later because it was just so true and dead-on and so exquisitely phrased and also pleasantly perverse that you just can't forget it.  <BR>His humor burrows its way (pardon the vaguely disturbing rodent metaphor here) into your psyche and you're funnier just for having read it. AT least, I think I am....
B00005JKZV|5.0|This brief review (a longer one will follow when the DVD is released) is only to say that in retrospect, while \\"The Two Towers\\" is a brilliant film all by itself, the way it played loose with the book begins to nag me more and more.  As with \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\", it would have been an even greater film had they just stuck completely to Tolkien's original words and scenes; the new scenes that replace them in the film are fine, but they do not improve on the original and have a slightly over-dramatic feel that seems gratuitous (especially Aragorn's death, which holds no dramatic tension at all since anyone who read the book would realize immediately that he will be revived in no time, since he plays a huge role in \\"Return of The King\\").  Although I realize that a three-hour film could never hope to contain everything in the book, they should have at least tried to make everything that was in there as faithful as possible, and I would rather have had some scenes that were cut from the book in place of Aragorn's protracted \\"death\\" sequence.  Anyways, I know I sound like a whiner but \\"The Two Towers\\" is kind of like the Mona Lisa, and tampering with it is no small item.  I am just thankful that the end result was still pretty amazing in all departments, thanks to all involved; the CGI Gollum sends chills down the spine.
0140282033|2.0|This novel starts out with promise. A woman and her daughter move to a staid, old-fashioned village and open a chocolate shop across from the local church. The 'voice' of the novel alternates sporatically between that of the heroine, Vianne Rocher, and that of Pere Reynaud, the town's spiritual leader. Both characters were intriguing and extremes - Vianne hedonistic and full of life and Pere Reynaud, pious and self-sacrificing. I hoped the relationship between the two would prove to be a tempering experience, thus moving them both toward a more realistic center. Instead by book's end Pere Reynaud has become a grand buffoon while Vianne has won the accolades of the entire village. Lansquenet-sous-Tannes seems so rooted in the past that it's incongruous whenever something modern, like a VCR, is mentioned. Although the heroine's oft repeated wish is to be able to finally stay in one place, by the end of the story her wanderlust has returned. A good thing too - if she leaves town her friend Josephine need never learn that she slept with her boyfriend on a whim and is carrying his child. For a woman who often allows her six-year old daughter to go play by the river alone it will be beneficial to have a spare in case of the inevitable accident.
B000007MVU|3.0|For Ringo Starr's first solo project, he chose to record an album of standards.  It might have seemed like an odd choice at the time, but these are songs he grew up with, being favorites of his mum and dad.  To give the project some variety, every song was arranged by a different person.  Naturally, some of the arrangements are more interesting than others.  &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, arranged by Maurice Gibb, has an almost vaudevillian feel to it.  Many of the other songs have swing arrangements that really cook.  As for Ringo himself, well, he's no Frank Sinatra.  But they wisely chose songs that were within his rather limited range and he managed to acquit himself rather well.  Fans of Ringo that have an appreciation for the old standards should get a kick out of this album.

B0000065O1|5.0|I've been working out for 20 years now and have tried every aerobic class, kickboxing class, tae bo, pilates, power walking, you name it...I've done it. Nothing, and I repeat, &quot;nothing&quot; has ever given me a better workout than this tape. It's definitely not for beginners. This is the ONLY workout where I get up the next morning and feel where I've worked - all in my arms, inner thighs, behind, calves...everything is sore WHERE I want to be sore!  The music is very motivating (not boring beats) and you feel like you're in the same room with Cindy just working out. Radu has been &quot;hard core&quot; for years, so those who review this tape negatively obviously have never worked as hard as Radu pushes his people. What's wrong with full sit-ups? We've been doing them for years until one day someone decides they're not good for us. You can certainly modify as Cindy suggests. This is the ONLY tape I know of that works every single body part --- AND you feel it! I accidentally taped over mine so here I am to purchase another! Enjoy!

B000001GY9|5.0|I have grown up with Maestro Bernstein.  When I was young there was fire in all of the performances that I owned.  Bernstein and Ormandy were at the top of the list when it came to fiery and great orchestral performances.  I had his Beethoven cycle, several of the Mahler symphonies both with Mestroes Bernstein and Ormandy.<br />When I lost my first collection,to a fire,I did not buy recordings for some time.  But, when I did, I went back to my old Ormandy favorites and started purchasing Muti PHO recordings and started to learn to listen to the more expres-sive and refined recordings.  They were as maginificently played, as before, but I had grown and my listening powers had grown to appreciate phrasing and nuance and deeper emotional conducting.  I had learned to tell the difference between the 'warhorse' style and the 'expressive' style.<br />I must say that this is the most beautiful, introspective conducting I might have ever heard.  I say buy this set for the adagio of the 2nd symphony alone. Tears were streaming down my face at the end of it. The soaring of the strings in the final moments, I was sobbing!  I don't know how the Maestro was able to conduct the finale, it was a live performance after all, although the time between movements was not on the recording itself.  Musicians and conductor had to take a really deep breath after that because it was absolutely breathtaking! Then the finale was so positive so enlightening.  I must say I have never heard a finer performance.<br />I used to have the old recordings of the first and fourth by the Maestro and also the Szell recordings, which were considered the standard, especially the second. These were not the deeply expressive performances we have here.  I will say greatly performed, but 'warhorse'type performances.  <br />Again, the instrospection and how Maestro Bernstein brings the virtuosity of the orchestra and the refinement of the strings.  Yes there is fire when it is needed, but the refinement, the change of tempo, the nuance of every phase.  Did Ricardo Muti study with him?<br />I don't know about you, but the audience noise does not bother me because recorded perfomances are usually much more intense and incredibly better in front of an audience.  Isn't that what a performer dreams of doing anyway?  Isn't that the life of a performer to give his/her all infront of a live audience?<br />Well, there is no disappointment here because the guts of every performer, including the Maestro, are laid out on the stage for all to feel and hear.<br />My highest recommendation!
B00006AUIG|3.0|Here's a film to put back community attitudes towards mental illness by a hundred years. Actually, it's positively medieval. Cast and crew in the special features go out of their way to express how 'creeped out' they were by the asylum, Mallen even going as far to suggest he was haunted by voices. All this furthers the distasteful equation the film pushes that mental illness=evil. 'They' cannot be trusted to walk amongst you because they will KILL YOU, your WORKMATES and even their OWN FAMILIES! It's as nastily exploitative a message as 'Black Christmas'. Still, those of you who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing that you will like. It has a squirm inducing ending up (or down?) there with the eye gouging scene in '28 Days Later'. In fairness, the film manages to induce a sense of dread about three quarters the way through that never lets up. But this is where we came in. Ironically, the director's soporific, monotonous commentary suggests what it might be like to experience a frontal lobotomy.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I was very disappointed when At The Drive-In split up but when I heard that they were splitting into two bands I was excited.  I purchased both Sparta's album and Mars Volta's Tremulant when they came out and I must say I was much more impressed with the Mars Volta effort.<br />I've tried to get into the Sparta album but all the songs sound the same and they really don't offer anything really special.  On the other hand, Cedric and Omar have gone on to Mars Volta and made one heck of an album with De-Loused in the Comatorium.  The guitar work is stunning, the lyrics are in-depth and interesting, and the entire sound is fresh. <br />The Mars Volta are the complete opposite of ATDI, yet they offer a fantastic sound.  You may have to get used to it because it almost shocks you-- but once you get the feel, you'll love it!
B00005JM09|5.0|Those who were skeptical about a Terminator movie without James Cameron and Linda Hamilton need not fear anymore.  Jonathan Mostow delivers a new Terminator that feels like the others but has touches that only a new director could deliver.  Arnold is tremendous as he portrays a much darker T-850 than the last one.  This Terminator has much more in common with the first, rather than the heroic second.  (FYI, This particular Terminator kills John Conner before he is sent back to the present.)<BR>The plot in this movie is very straight forward but with a twist.  In this edition the Terminator is sent back through time to protect... (not John Conner) but rather his lieutenants in the war.  What is he protecting them against?  The Terminatrix or T-X.  Much like the T-1000, T-X can morph into any person they come in contact with, except for one major exception.  T-X CAN form complex machines (i.e. she comes with a plasma cannon and a flamethrower) and she can also interface with other machines in order to control them.  The first chase scene drives this home.<BR>This isn't the best of the three, but what third movie in a series is.  But don't miss the climax that you never expected and don't feel bad if you come out of the theater crying.  I along with many others did.  T3 is the summer movie! Don't even think about missing it.
B000069CWE|2.0|I seriously dislike this album.Maybe its because I am not very big into this type of music on Reanimation,who knows.But all I know is that this isn't really good.Almost everything on here is a remix,and I prefer new work than just remixes.The new songs aren't that great,either.I'm not a Linkin Park hater- far from one.I thought 'Hybrid Theory' was pretty good but this is just garbage.Don't waste any money on this.
B000002JPA|5.0|Whenever I come to review one of my favourite Cd's I am always presented with a problem: to avoid letting my unintentional bias towards the recording transform the review into a sickly and lengthy piece of gushing praise. I suppose I should mention I do actually prefer 'Awake' to this album (blasphemy?), but this does not chnage the fact that 'Images and Words' is one of the cds that spins most often in my player. If you've perused some of the other reviews on this page, or even heard anything at all about this band, youll probably be aware what to expect here: dizzyingly profficient musicianship, incomprehensibly complicated instrumental passages, La Brie's peerless vocals, all topped off with intricate song structures. How Dream Theater manage to be so compelling in the face of all this I dont know: be aware, Amazon customer, that they're not appealing to everyone, not even everyone I've met. The album is in places heavy (check the main riff on 'Pull me Under'), and at times achingly beautiful ('Wait for sleep', 'Surrounded'), and at times both ('Metropolis part 1','Learning to Live'- the album highlights). Now comes my sycophantic fan spiel: this is truly an atonishing album, almost flawless. Sure,'Take the Time' is a bit overrated and at times ludicrous, but it is still streets ahead of anything else their contemporaries were churning out in 1992. Above anything else though, Id say that the most important and even revolutionary thing about this album is not the musicianship or the songs themselves, it is the records potential for introducing new fans to prog metal, and progressive music in general. If you are new to this genre, I honestly cannot reccommend this album enough as a starting point. Dream Theater have a pantheon of influences (check my other reviews), and this band will reward you themselves, before leading you into a whole world of great music.<br />For this reason alone I give 'I&W' 5 stars, but the fact remains that it is a paradigm of how progressive metal should be played: with skill, pashion, soul and care.<br />I cant emphasise enough how much you need to own this album.ve metal should be played: with skill, pashion, soul and care.<BR>I cant emphasise enough how much you need to own this album.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Before the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring came out, I had never heard of the The Lord of the Rings series. Thanks to Peter Jackson, I am now hooked to it and can't wait until the third one. But anyway, The Two Towers (in my opinion) was better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There was more action and the story was going along instead of just introducing the characters. I have read the books and I must say that The Two Towers was a really good book. I would recommend it to anyone. However, I didn't really like the fact that they stopped and started the movies (1&2) in different places than the books. The end of the Two Towers ends earlier than the book so they are going to have to make the last movie longer so they can fit the rest of the Two Towers into it. Tolkien was an incredible author and I can't believe someone tried to make his books into a movie because it is (or in this case WAS) an impossible task. People tried to make The Lord of the Rings movies before and I am sure they wouldn't have come close to Jackson's version. I love this movie and EVERYONE should see it.
0792839749|4.0|I remember seeing this film in the early 70's as a child and will never forget the experience. It was playing at a revival house, on a double bill with another film, and this one (not the film I was going there to see, by the way) carried me away so much that I cannot remember what film was paired with it. Since then I adored this enchanting fantasy epic. Upon seeing it again as an adult I was expecting to be disappointed (most of what we loved as children tends to pale as we get older), but I was not, in fact, I think I adore this charming concoction of tenderness, humour, fantastic situations and great musical numbers even more now than I did then.<BR>And that leads me to my opening question: why do critics hate this film? I have never heard or read any professional critic say a good word about this film, in fact, it's on many critics' \\"worst films of all time\\" lists, and even popped up in that bible of bad cinema, Medved's \\"Golden Turkey Awards\\" book. I could never figure this out. Perhaps too many critics compare it to \\"Mary Poppins\\" and find it wanting. Surely, a temptation to do so is overwhelming, seeing as it popped up in that stream of (mostly poor) Poppins immitations that followed in the wake of Poppins' incredible box office and critical success, it stars Dick Van Dyke and features a score by the Sherman Brothers, songwriters for the Disney classic. But, while this film is certainly no Poppins, a comparison with the earlier film is unfair. Ian Fleming fans, of course, dislike the film because it bears little or no relation to the book (the screenplay by Roald Dahl was, to my own childlike imagination, however, fare more enjoyable - I found the book disappointing after viewing the film, unusual for me). But I will always cherish this film, its score, Dick Van Dyke's genius, Sally Ann Howes' charm, and Dahl's fantastic screenplay. I would recommend any parent to share this film with their children to show them what great fantasy ffamily film-making was like in the late sixties and early seventies.<BR>However, a wide-screen issue would be most appreciated.
0440178002|4.0|My dad recommended Shogun to me when I was in high school ~~ but the sheer volume of this book put me off. I happened to stumble across it in a book sale and decided to try it. It happily accounted for all of my spare time for two weeks (which I didn't have much of!). <br />This is an extremely fascinating read ~~ I am real glad I picked it up. However, I must warn you, half way through the book, the author seems to have hit a dry spell ~~ it was very dry and hard for me to get through it. In my opinion, it should have been edited out because it was not that relevant to the story. It does pick up again ~~ and it really keeps you thinking of Feudal Japan for a long time after. <br />This story is about Blackthorne, a bold Englisher who stumbled across Japan in a storm, Mariko, a lovely Christian Samurai woman, who falls in love with Blackthorne, and Lord Toranaga, who is one of the regents ruling on the behalf of the Heir. This is their story ~~ a true soap opera of life in the times of Feudal Japan. This is a fun read ~~ it has it all. Samauri fighting for their lords, mystery, intrigue, plots, sex, romance, whirlwind battles and so forth ~~ I am glad I had a chance to read this book. It would have been a five if it weren't for that long stretch of irrelevant waiting period ~~ where time seemed to have stood still for over 200 pages! Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone! If you're a history buff, this book is definitely for you!<br />7-7-03
1582432678|5.0|Nature or nurture is the problem Shriver is attempting to answer in her absolutely stunning novel. She really doesn't succeed in answering what is probably an unanswerable question, but her book is must reading.<br />I bought the book after reading an article on it in the NY Observer a couple of weeks ago which described the book as an underground hit among NYC feminists. I am still shaking somewhat as a result of reading this book and I'm not stinting in my recommendations to friends to read this book. For a mother (or father, too) this book should be required reading!

0688163173|1.0|I hated the ending of this book. The majority of the novel was actually good reading, but about 25 pages before the end of the book I'd had it with the mental cruelty of the book -- not only with what seemed like cruelty of some of the characters, but with the author's playing with my forebearance. At that point I flipped through the last pages merely scanning them for content, to see if it was more of the same stuff (which it was), and then finally got to the very last pages and felt well...betrayed.<br />I've read all of Lehane's other books and thought they were all excellent. This one was a waste of time and patience. Perhaps it could have been a good Alfred Hitchcock short story. It just was a disappointing novel from a fine author trading on his reputation earned from writing a completely different kind of novel.<br />As other reviews show, some people really enjoyed the book, so apparently that's possible, but Lehane fans should be warned that this is really not like the &quot;Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro&quot; novels. At all.
B00009V7RF|3.0|This album is filled with with some really cool songs; but, the song that caught my attention the most was &quot;Where is the Love.&quot;  The first time I listened to that song, I was bustin' a moby around a fire with some tassels who were pretty deck.  There were two frados there, who also brought their midtowner friends.  We were all about to change stations, but once listening to the beat of this song, we turned it up.  The tassels were unzipping their shorts, thus dancing around in their underwear.  The song was hip; those guys are real cool cats.  I grabbed some kale the other day, and went out and bought the CD; the other songs rocked too.  I recommend this album most indefintely; especially those looking to engage in copulation.  The song may be about Sept. 11 and such, but the love is really in your pants; you've got to whip out, and show your love to all the ladies.  (I'm just trying to show more of the physical, engaging qualities this CD can produce.)  Peace out.
B0000931OG|4.0|Compared to the other contender for the brainy summer rock album crown, Radiohead's Hail to the Thief, Blur's Think Tank sounds positively tame in comparison.  Lyrics are sunshiny, soft.  Mood music pieces seem culled from the very Morroco that served as their recording grounds.  Rarely is the music truly dark and heavy, nor is it as immediate and pummeling as Radiohead's latest effort.  Few songs progress neatly from point A to B, especially more out-there tracks such as the Primal Scream-referenced instrumental &quot;Jets&quot;, or the hidden Talking Heads-ish speak-sing &quot;My White Noise&quot;.  Yet for all the high expectations they have contending with not only the other big British band but also their own sanctity as a musical group with the departure of Graham Coxon, they pull off this setpiece surprisingly well, and probably goes to show that Damon Albarn is a more essential part of the Blur experience than some may have thought.<br />True, some changes had to be made.  Gone (for the most part) is the heady experimental guitar squall, showing up on only a few tracks (&quot;Crazy Beat&quot;, &quot;We've Got a File on You&quot;, and the sole Coxon contribution &quot;Battery In Your Leg&quot;).  It is replaced by a much more rhythmic mindset, and yes, a penchant for some &quot;world music&quot; flavor.  They cop bands and artists left and right, such as Bowie, Talking Heads, Primal Scream, Radiohead, Iggy Pop, yet despite the record being all over the place there is still the core Blur-ness that makes all of their more experimental ventures easier to swallow and more natural than it would be with lesser bands.  They effect a style change reminiscent of Primal Scream's recent evolution into rhythm-based rock/techno hybrids and instrumental stylings, though much softer and more restrained.  Strangely, the most traditional &quot;Blur-like&quot; track, the aforementioned &quot;Battery In Your Leg,&quot; comes off sounding the most tame and least adventurous.  Despite Albarn's shortcomings with lyrics on this record and his fairly tame guitar skills, he still manages to forge something that can hold its own with the rest of the Blur legacy, and yet point forward to directions anew.  Give it a chance; Coxon was always only 1/4th of Blur, anyways.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This is one fantastic sci-fi film that wasn't what some people were expecting.  Sure, it doesn't follow the book, but neither did The Shining, and that was a great movie in it's own right.  I think people were expecting Starship Troopers to be some heavy handed, serious sci-fi flick.  Don't go into it with that kind of mindset or you'll probably be let down.  Starship Troopers is nothing more than a big budgeted B movie.  Just look at the name of the film!  It sounds like a story from the old Weird Science E.C. comic.  There is no message, social commentary or any of that crud.  Yeah, there's a little underlying WWII fascist society motif going on, but it really doesn't add or subtract from what the film really is.  What we get here is bad acting, campiness, lots O violence and gore a little nudity, giant monsters running amuck-all the fixins for a great B film.  You won't see many films like this hitting the mainstream, coz CGI costs alot of money, and Hollywood doesn't like to risk this kind of money on a film without it being safe, politically correct and PG-13.  From Dusk Till Dawn is another great example of a big budget B movie that made it to the mainstream.  This movie is special in that it breaks that taboo.  Verhoeven has always been good at this-he did it with Robocop(how a film that violent got made into a cartoon is still a mystery).  Honestly folks, check this out if you haven't already, but bear in mind that you have to view it the way you'd view Killer Klowns From Outer Space or one of the old Lost In Space episodes.  Enjoy it coz we might not see many more like it.

B00006FDCD|5.0|To me, horror should be more than a crazed person with a chain saw or ax.  This made-for-tv stephen king adaption performs a 'fun' form of horror that is far better than any other horror around.  I don't know about you, but who wants to Buy a movie that just has guts flying all over the screen?  Not I.  This movie has zero violence, but the horror is just as powerful as any nightmare on elm street.<br />The story has to do with 7 friends from childhood, who discovered their small town Derry, Maine featured a monster that so horrible it is nameless.  They finally destroy the beast, but 30 years later... IT comes back, so once again the friends attempt to kill the darned thing.<br />This movie is both Fun, by the fact that you can enjoy it without throwing up, and the fact that our slasher is a Clown.  But viewing this in the day will be an enjoying experience, viewing it in the night will result in nightmares.  a must have for any stephen king, horror, or movie buff.

B00003CWTI|5.0|I began watching Magnolia with no preconceived ideas at all. In the end, I was quite impressed with its boldness and emotional power. It was a very good film.<br />I just recently saw the film on IFC. I had heard some good reviews and some reviews that described it as very strange. Never one to turn away from a strange film, I decided to give it a try. From the first frame it struck me as daring, vivid and unconventional. The opening sequence immediately captured me and the film never really lost my attention. There is no doubt though, it was long and it took effort to sit and watch. But that does not mean it was bad, as some have said. It just took more energy to watch than the average movie does. I enjoyed the manic-depressive and seemingly random style that Anderson used. I wasn't always completely sure what was happening, or why. But I was still captivated by what I was watching. Every actor fit his or her part perfectly. The film was full of dramatic imagery and meaning, but in no way did it come across as pompous. I saw a film that had a genuine message and took risks in order to convey that message in the most effective way. Frogs falling from the sky is definitely a risk. I know this was a stumbling block for many viewers. But this scene, while admittedly fantastic, worked.<br />A key message that I drew from the movie is that there will nearly always be change and uncertainty; but that is not necessarily bad. Another message I saw is that we must challenge ourselves to be honest, open and forgiving. When you think about it, it is scary just how dishonest we all can be, even with ourselves. The film warned that when you lie to yourself and those you love, you will end up alone in the world. At one point or another I felt like any one of the main characters was just about to kill his or her self. But by the same token, I saw each character show genuine happiness and contentment as well. I understood this to be an expression of how we all have happiness and sadness, and the best way to find peace and love is to be yourself.dness, and the best way to find peace and love is to be yourself.

B000063DIR|1.0|I have always loved the 1995 remastered edition of Diary of a Madman, and when this, the 2002 remaster came out I bought it quickly, expecting virtually the same if not better than the 1995 version (also what with the bonus track and all), but as soon as I put it in the CD player it didn't sound right at all. Then I looked in the info about it in the booklet and it said that the original drums and bass guitar had been cut out and replaced with new recordings by Ozzy's current bass player and drummer, Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin. Now don't get me wrong, I have great respect for both of them, but they do not do the songs anywhere remotly near the justice they deserved when they were originally recorded by Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake. If you are looking to buy Diary of a Madman, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS ALBUM, GET THE 1995 REMASTER (the one with the small album cover in the middle with the green background and OZZY written down the right-hand side in big yellow letters)

I yelled.<br />'Have you read it?' asked Pooh.<br />This is two-way book: to explain Taoism through Winnie-the-Pooh, and to explain Winnie-the-Pooh (not always an easy task itself) through Taoism. Taoism, more academically, is a religion indigenous to China, built upon teachings primarily of Lao-tzu, with significant influence from Buddha and K'ung Fu-tse. It is in the teachings of harmony and emptiness and being of Lao-tzu, however, that Taoism draws its meaning, believing that earth is a reflection of heaven, and that the world `is not a setter of traps but a teacher of valuable lessons.'<br />As with many religions, this one took various guises: philosophic, monastic, structural, folk. But through them all, the imperceptible Tao, the essence of being, essentially undescribable, shapes the universe continually out of chaos, with a yin and yang alteration of perpetual transformation, in which nothing remains eternal save the Tao.<br />This makes Pooh a perfect example and exemplar. `For the written character P'u, the typical Chinese dictionary will give a definition of 'natural, simple, plain, honest.' P'u is composed of two separate characters combined: the first, the 'radical' or root-meaning one, is that for tree or wood; the second, the 'phonetic' or sound-giving one, is the character for dense growth or thicket.'<br />Through semantic changes, perfectly in keeping with the Tao, we find that Pooh, or P'u, is actually a tree in the thicket, or a wood not cut, or finally, an Uncarved Block. And this, of course, is what pure being is.<br />Pooh, in his journey through the Tao, with the Tao, of the Tao (it is a hard one to nail down, isn't it?) encounters many. This includes Eeyore, the terminally morose, who represents Knowledge for the sake of Complaining about Something. It also includes Owl, the Western successor of the 'Confucianist Dedicated Scholar', who believes he has all truth as his possession, and studies Knowledge for the Sake of Knowledge (even if it isn't always the best knowledge).  `You can't help respecting anybody who can spell TUESDAY, even if he doesn't spell it right; but spelling isn't everything. There are days when spelling Tuesday simply doesn't count.'<br />Of course, all of the knowledge of the Owl, accompanied by the variable helpfulness of Rabbit who cannot stop activity in favour of just being something, couldn't figure out what had become of Christopher Robin, who left the Very Clear Note on his door:<br />GON OUT<br />BACKSON<br />BISY<br />BACKSON<br />Who or what is a Backson? Backsons are those people trying to outrun their shadows and their footprints, not realising that to stand still and rest in the shade defeats the power of both. And of course, the Bisy Backson is never at a standstill. And of course, one cannot experience the Tao, be the Tao, know the Tao (well, you get the Tao) if one is perpetually on the run.<br />The Bisy Backson is always<br />GONE OUT<br />BACK SOON<br />BUSY<br />BACK SOON<br />or, maybe GONE SOON. Anywhere. Anywhere he hasn't been. Anywhere but where he is. Of course, the idea of not going anywhere is abhorrent to him, and there is no concept of being able to do nothing.<br />Nothingness frees the mind. Nothing works like nothing. For there is nothing to distract you. Nothing to get in the way. Nothing to hinder you. Nothing means anything.<br />Now, read that last sentence again, carefully.<br />Nothing means anything.<br />Any thing is by definition itself, but when it is no thing, it can become potentially any thing.<br />'Oh, I see,' said Pooh.<br />Wisdom lies in the way of Pooh, who shirks the busy-ness of Rabbit, the intellectual hubris of Owl, and the doom-saying of Eeyore. Pooh simply is, and enjoys being who he is. Pooh is a Master, who knows the Way. Learn from him. Learn to be with him.e,' said Pooh.<br />Wisdom lies in the way of Pooh, who shirks the busy-ness of Rabbit, the intellectual hubris of Owl, and the doom-saying of Eeyore.

0156027321|5.0|Its a wonderful story.  Awesome read.  Well writen, visceral *and* intellectual. Fun.  A lot of people say they expected either a more confirming case for God or for atheism.  Wouldn't they be represented by the priests touting their version of belief is the one true way?  Seeing the world through a single filter.  <br />The point is, at the end you're asked to believe one story or the other.  Martel makes the point, however, that your choice reflects your approach to life.  Ultimately it doesn't matter which story happened, you get to the end either way, but one is far more colorful and passionate.  So, I think he makes a case for religion if only that it &quot;makes a better story&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|One thing I can say is that this book is incredible.  I started in the morning and couldn't stop until I closed the book at 10 p.m.  The plot was intertwined with fact and fiction and awakened a new side of me.  A renewed interest in art and religion!  I do not want to say much about the book because it may or may not spoil it for you, however, this is an INTENSE read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and if you are so inclined, you may want to seek out Dan Brown's website that coincides with this book.  After you've read it, of course.<br />Enjoy this very interesting, well put together, and thought provoking book.  I know I did!
B00005MP58|5.0|It is the best!  The scenery is breathtaking and the acting is fantastic.  You'll love it!
B00004RYZT|5.0|Seeming Rammstein is one of my favourite bands and i had just gotten a dvd player I though i'd may aswell buy this dvd, and what did i get??? I got the best metal dvd performance you can get!!!<br />The dvd contains 17 tracks from their albums Herzeleid and Sehnsucht(done live)and the extra features you get the concert with german subtitles and you get a multicamera mode for the 3 songs Tier, Du Hast and Rammstein. With the multicamera mode you get a choice of 6 angles which lets you decide what you would like to mostly see e.g. directors cut, guitars, drums, bass and keys, wides and vocals. Another extra feature you get is a 14:30 interview with the band. The interview allows you to have a choice of subtitles including English, Spanish and French, and if your computer can read dvd's you can insert this dvd and you view a rammstein trivia fan contest containing 140 questions.<br />The performance was great. Rammstein perform with a great deal of colourful lights and mist and there is a great use of fire at the concert. The dvd lets you see all the action including the violence and as a special treat for the fans, rammstein use explosives, flame throwers, flaming arrows and fireworks and the main highlights of the dvd are the tracks Rammstein were Till Lindeman(singer) performs on fire(using safety clothesing) and another highlight is Engel were the guitarists daughter plays as the girl in the cage with fire. My favourite performance is Du Riechst So Gut were Till Lindeman(singer) shoots flaming arrows at the beginning of the song. Another great thing about the performance is that Till Lindeman(singer) didn't just stand there and sing, he sang while acting like that people can understand the message he is trying to get across.<br />The crowd is good aswell, they are very loud. They jump up and down or nod their heads for most of the time and they join in on the choruses and before and after every song they show their respect by clapping or whistling, so if you like metal dvd's with big crowds then this is for you.<br />The subject of the songs are mainly about various types of love(even says in interview) and there are a few songs about religion. The disturbing songs about love include Du Riechst So Gut which talks about stalking and Spiel Mit Mir talking about gay love(in an explicit way which is why its bad). Ok, now onto the the nondisturbing songs about love. The nondisturbing songs about love include Wilder Wein which is about love including a bottle of whine. The songs about religion include the song Engel and Asche Zu Asche and yes Rammstein do include violence in some songs including Weisses Fleisch which is just about mindless violence, so if you have a faint heart and are thinking about getting this, i suggest you not look at the lyrics translated which may put you off.<br />Ok, i've basically told you a fair bit about the dvd, so now i shall chucck in some reminders. The song Bueck Dich is censored from the dvd seeming people thought not only the lyrics but the performance was explicit, though in my opinion i though the performance was silly and in the dvd there is a hidden track called stripped, i hav'nt tried it, but i hear you press 23 at main menu and you then press enter. Overall thankyou for your time reading this review. I hope it gave you more of an idea of the dvd and hopefully you may buy it.
B000002AE3|5.0|This has to be one of the best engineered pop albums I've ever heard.  You don't have to be a TOTO fan to appreciate the superb quality and musicianship of this recording.  I picked it up at the library by accident and now I can't get enough of it.
B000001Y79|5.0|Hey,<BR>This cd was the best ever! You should buy it! The best song on it was Just A Girl ( Number 3) or Spiderwebs (1). I also like Excuse Me Mr.(2).If you wanna listen to some fun rock then buy this cd!
B000002UJQ|5.0|The only reason I bought OK Computer was because I was in the mood for one song that I knew was on the CD at the time. I had never heard any other song by Radiohead or anything about them, except that my brother liked them, and I remembered seeing one of their videos on MTV. I didn't know the name of it, but if I saw it I knew I would remember it...oh that's right, it was Paranoid Android (the first single released off OK Computer and one of my favorite songs ever)! Every time I listened Paranoid Android on my computer I liked it more, so I thought I'd be adventerous and buy the whole CD-One of the best choices I ever made. Not only do I like just about every song on the CD, but they all sound distinct and really good! If you haven't heard a song on this CD, I recommend you borrow from a friend, brother, or wherever you can get it, because it is definitely one of the greatest albums of all time (not just to me but to several other people, including my brother).
0441172717|5.0|Like many great books, &quot;Dune&quot; can be understood on many levels. On the surface, it is great Science Fiction, introducing a complex world of intrigue and imagination.  On another, it is a religious novel -- a comparison between Catholicism and Islam, and the uniting of both of those religions through a future messiah.  It is good literature, with complex characters representing the classic heroic and diabolical archetypes.  Finally, you can relate to the characters -- especially Paul, who grows from boy to man to something much more complex -- right before your eyes.<br />Well worth reading.  And re-reading.
B00005JM09|2.0|Clearly T3 was expected to revive an old franchise, as well as the sagging career of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  In both respects, it fails miserably.  The film is, however, well directed, with crisp action sequences that are very well choreographed.  It is both the source material and the acting that fall flat.  Every key performance in this film is flat and uninspired, from Schwartzenegger on down.  The script is also uninspired, failing to break very much new ground and rehashing virtualy every cliche from the first two films.  <br />While the first film broke new ground in its science fiction detail and the second film broke new ground with its dazzling special effects, this film does neither.  Basically, if you watch it without giving much thought to what's going on, you may find it to be an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but if you want real entertainment, rent or buy one of the first two movies.
B00004KD11|4.0|Exotic, mesmerizing, even a little eerie.  Those are the adjectives that come to mind when describing the first recording by Deep Purple.<br />At this stage the band  did some creative tunes both originals and covers.  The main reason for my purchasing this CD was the fantastic cover version of Hush.  Love the organ tones and the vocal harmonies on this one.  The beat is so ultra cool as well.  This song alone practically elevates the record to three star status.<br />But one great song alone, does not make a solid record.  Love the cover version of Help.  The band does it like a ballad but Ritchie Blackmore throws in a stunning guitar solo.  The alternate version as one of the bonus tracks sounds intriguing as well.<br />One More Rainy Day, Love Help Me, and Mandrake Root are good originals.  Shadows is a decent outake, the cover of Hey Joe is interesting if a little overdone.  I guess it depends on the mood your in.<br />A good debut although I like The Book of Taliesyn just a wee bit better.  Nonetheless, this record stands quite tall.
B0000009SM|5.0|While my Zappa collection grows to the dozens, I've found myself listening to this album constantly.  While when I first started listening to FZ I preferred his instrumental work like Hot Rats, Waka Jawaka, and The Grand Wazoo, rather then his satire drenched albums such as Were Only In It For The Money, Joes Garage, and Freak Out! One Size Fits All has the best of both equations, great jamming with roll on the floor hilarity oozing from the vocals.  I haven't tired of any of the songs on the disc, just grown fonder of them over time.  The second to last cut \\"Andy\\" is the most underrated song in FZ's collection.  A hard funk groove mixed with equally hard rock and roll with lyrics so poignant, they will still be enlightening eons from now.  This is THE Frank Zappa album to have, some aficionado's would state that \\"Were Only In It For The Money\\" is his essential recording, which it does reserve that title for good reason, I don't think its for everyone.  This disc however could be enjoyed by anyone, if your even thinking about getting into Zappa, expanding your collection, or just need something new to enjoy, this disc is a must have.
6302477751|4.0|It's a twisted variation on all of the &quot;boy and his dog&quot; movies on the market. It's also a modern suburban reinterpretation of Frankenstein. And it's one of Tim Burton's first efforts as a movie director.<br />Burton's quirky, dark sense of humor and drama is very apparent in this early effort.

B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's sophomore effort is definitely a high water mark in thrash metal. From start to finish Metallica is relentless, all members are in tip top form and drive hard until the last note. This album is definitely a sign of a maturing band but there is no lack of thrash. <br />The album opens with FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE features a classical guitar intro, but soon transitions into one of he fastest and heaviest songs ever done by Metallica. Lars Ulrich's drums put great emphasis on the expert rhythm guitar work by James Hetfield. The song is about the oncoming threat of nuclear war and its effect on our future. <br />RIDE THE LIGHTNING is a song that would fit onto Kill Em All just as well as it does on this album. It is a thrashing song about someone who is to be executed. Not one of my favorite songs on the album, but Hetfield's lyrics are in shining form.<br />FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a great song about soldiers on the battlefield being killed off, and the horrors of war. The track is kicked off with a bass solo by Cliff Burton. The crunchy rhythm guitar drives the track, and is relentless to the finish. The lead guitar is good, but some is taken from Black Sabbath's Fairies Wear Boots. <br />On FADE TO BLACK, Metallica slow it down on a song about the contemplation of suicide. This was a change for Metallica with its introspective lyrics, low speeds, and traditional melody. This is considered by many the best on the album and is a fan favorite. <br />TRAPPED UNDER ICE is a high speed thrasher about drowning, by falling into a frozen lake. The highly dramatic lyrics add to the song, describing in great detail the experience of drowning. The rhythm guitar is great, and Kirk Hammett has screaming leads throughout the song. <br />ESCAPE is not one of my favorites on the album due to its lack of interesting lyrics and guitar parts. <br />CREEPING DEATH is a great song about Passover. The rhythm guitar is excellent, the lyrics and vocal delivery by Hetfield are verypowerful. The song thrashes throughout and its chants of DIE! have made this a fan favorite at live shows. Their are many interesting leads throughout the song and the harmonic minor scale at the end gives it an Egyptian feel that is hinted by the lyrics.<br />The instrumental album closer THE CALL OF KTULU is a great way to end the album, as the song progresses it slowly increases in intensity, reaches the climax, and falls back into the intro. This rising action adds suspense to the song and adds emotion to the song that replaces the use of lyrics. The Call Of Ktulu is a truly memomrable way to close a great album.

B00004LN16|3.0|\\"Why've gotta stiff upper lip...and I shoot from the hip!!\\"<br />- Brian Johnson, 2000<br />That line says it all about this tuff New York band who came from England and Scotland.  This is one tuff album, and AC/DC is one tuff band, one of the last tuff bands around, actually.<br />Gritty frontman Brian \\"the grit\\" Johnson has never sounded better than on this album, wouldn't you agree?  Also, the guitar by the little school guy is excellent, as always, as is the virtuoso drumming by longtime drummer Phil \\"Mr. Excitement\\" Rudd.  Not since England's Saxon have we seen such a revolution in the world of hard-rock rock 'n' roll!!  Agreed??<br />As for the racous songs on this AC/DC masterpiece - they speak for themselves, they're simply seminal AC/DC, perhaps superceding \\"Black 'n' Black\\" from 1980.  Turn these songs up, play 'em loud, salute rock 'n' roll for what it's worth, cuz it'll soon be gone, folks, very soon indeed.  <br />Raspy vocals, raunchy sentiments and loud riff-chugging is what this album offers....do you got what it takes to hang??<br />Never forget the words of the immortal (immoral) Brian Johnson:  <BR>\\"Why've gotta stiff upper lip...and I shake from the hip!!\\"<br />CHECKIN' OUT!!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I am not a big Led Zeppelin fan, but I do love live music in general which is why I bought this. The early Led Zeppelin on this DVD-- Albert Hall in 1970 and the television performances in 1969 --  is so frenetic and rocking that it blew me away. Wow!<br />The performance for Iceland TV in 1969 features close up and clear view of Jimmy Page's crazy fingers roaring through a \\"Communication Breakdown\\" solo plus 3 other numbers. It's nice how clear and clean the TV camera is compared to concert film. You can often see alot more detail.<br />The 1969 appearance for a French variety show features LZ ripping through a set for a bunch of old people who are sitting on their hands and not cheering, and one little boy in the front rows with his fingers in his ears. Crazy! However, when Page starts using a violin bow on his guitar the fuddy duddies can't help themselves and sit on the edge of seats with their curiosity about the high octane freak show they are witnessing. They still don't cheer or dance however. Bizarre and funny.<br />Also the actual sound recording on this DVD sounds fantastic and I don't even have surround sound on my TV. Through a high quality stereo it will put you right there.
B000006TRV|3.0|Whatever deal these guys put together, the source has been revealed long ago...trust me on that.  <BR>Pink's odyssey began at a time in '79 when the world was a bit more uncertain yet dull, simple, thus the various intricacies that make up this opus.  <BR>The members of Floyd used string arrangments, shouts, and Gilmour's free-flowing guitar style to put a stamp on British/U.S. music history; a British invasion to coincide with the livelier New Wave of British Heavy Metal stardom that washed these shores back in '78, '79.  <br />All in all an eclectic and well-worn double album to add to your stereo collection.  Buy it on vinyl, for the warmth and scariness that comes through in sound is tenfold.  It's a classic of ages...
B000069I3K|2.0|I was spoiled for the movie by reading the book first and laughing out load in many spots.  The movie is sappy in many spots.  I guess the book spoiled the movie for me.  That and the Bone Fone that came out at the same time.
B000002L9O|3.0|Following the instant classic of \\"Too Tough To Die,\\" the infighting that had been rocking the Ramones since \\"End Of The Century\\" finally showed its cracks on \\"Animal Boy.\\" There are twelve songs here, half of which are classics. However, the bad (\\"Crummy Stuff,\\" \\"Apeman Hop\\") are thoroughly wretched.<br />The personality divisions are on painful display here. Joey's desire to make the band grow and expand exploded on the political roar of \\"Bonzo Goes To Bitburg\\" and the Phil Spectoresque \\"She Belongs To Me.\\" Then Johnny, who was fighting for the band to stay hard, gives a classic Ramones song with the title cut and \\"Freak Of Nature.\\" But the schizophrenic rifts are obvious and ultimately sink the album.<br />On the bright side, this album is a triumph for caught-in-the-middle Dee Dee, who makes the leap to great songwriting with \\"Bonzo\\" and \\"Something To Believe In.\\" The latter has the yearning that makes Beach Boys songs timeless and showcases Joey's voice perfectly. \\"Love Kills\\" gave him another chance to sing after the surprise of \\"Wart Hog.\\" And new member Richie hits the mark with his first Ramones contribution, \\"Somebody Put Something In My Drink.\\"<br />This is not the worst Ramones album (\\"Brain Drain\\" wins that title), but it's the most inconsistent. For me, \\"Animal Boy\\" was where the four star and perfect records stopped....for awhile, anyway.
B000002GFT|5.0|This CD is, hands down, one of the most important CDs in British folk-rock history.

0064407667|2.0|As an adult fan of youth literature I was intrigued by this book that claims if you are looking for a happy tale, don't read it. I thought the hook of the back cover description was brilliant and looked forward to reading the contents of the novel itself.<br />I admit that I was expecting a dark and dreary novel. The author gives us no illusions that it will be a happy tale. However, the nature of the dreariness is shocking. I did not expect for orphaned children to be struck by an adult, tortured and led blindly from one horrible situation to another.<br />I have no doubt these novels are popular with kids in the same sort of way that the \\"Garbage Pail Kids\\" appealed to an earlier generation. It's a fascination with the gross and beyond horrible that all kids share. In that way, the novel delivers very well, and I suspect the series will only grow in popularity amongst the \\"tween\\" set.<br />However, I would caution parents of younger children to read the book together, and explain that what happens to the children in the novel should *never* happen to children. The author pays some service to the diabolical nature of events, calling the tormentors dispicable, but I don't think a 9 year old will be able to read this novel without some resultant fear.<br />For other adults like myself who enjoy youth literature on occassion my advice is to skip this series. Not only was I cringeing at the actions in the plot, but the writing is distracting. The author is constantly giving definitions of words (in a clever way, I admit), but it makes the novel hard for an adult to read.
0671510991|5.0|In his book \\"Diplomacy\\", Henry Kissinger makes a valiant effort to study the history of international relations.  This in-depth and voluminous book delves into the past, giving a chronological account of the major events that shaped Western diplomacy.  Kissinger covers Richelieu, William of Orange, and follows the exploits of revolutionaries Napoleon III and Bismark.  An entire chapter is devoted to Realpolitik.<br />The downfall of this book is its weak conclusion.  Kissinger only gives a brief overview of the future threats facing America, and for a pre-September 11th book (1996), it offers little in regard to militant Islam and its dangers.  However, the book is valuable in its descriptions of modern diplomacy, especially World War II and the Cold War.  For students of the international realm, this is essential reading.  For lovers of history, this book is a gem.  Do yourself a favor and give it a read.<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of \\"Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller\\"
0316779237|5.0|While all of the stories and essays in Holidays on Ice are good, the standout is clearly \\"The Santaland Diaries\\".  I always think that if I laugh out loud while I'm reading something, then that by itself makes the book worth the price of purchase.  I actually had to put the story down till I pulled myself together enough to resume reading it. \\"The Santaland Diaries\\" is a glimpse at our own attitudes and behavior during \\"the festive holiday season\\".  Perhaps it is a clicheed sentiment (if a cynical opinion can be sentimental), but it is true that during the one time of the year when we should be celebrating peace and love for our fellow man, we behave like looters and scavengers in an orgy of mass consumption, ready to slit the throat of anyone who we percieve is trying to interfere with our quest to have a picture taken with a guy in a Santa suit.  Sedaris illustrates this with biting humor and, of course, fiction is never as funny as what happens in real life.  By the way, I'm pretty sure the story in \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" actually happened too.  Besides, I just love a story with a good whore in it.
B00005JKN9|5.0|The first half is a bloody, graphic, a-little-overdone, justification of violence in the service of vengence.<br />How much of the blood stained ground is a legitimate historical vision based on the character played by Daniel Day-Lewis, the butcher.<br />Versus how much is graphic gore to sell the movie, involve us emotionally, and to justify the reciprociated violence, i don't know.<br />What is obvious is that mid 19thC lower NewYork was not a pleasant walk in the park, it's people held life in low regard as a reflection of the greater society's condemnation of them to a living hell dominated by the very worse of human beings and human characteristics.<br />But, even though violence dominates the movie, it is not what it is about.<br />The movie is more like a well crafted novel with good historical anchoring, excellent character development and a richer multi-faceted plot than the usual Hollywood shoot-cut-them-up and watch them bleed movie. It justifiably earned and deserved the acclaim and awards it is gathering. But for me, movies like books are fundamentally vehicles to give my thoughts a boost, to put my energies into understanding something on the edge of my personal experience.<br />And this movie does this, for i started looking for information on old NewYork on the net, and looking for books after the movie had finished. I'd like to learn more, stimulated by the ideas in this movie. This is a very good thing.<br />But what is the movie about? What motivates the people, how are they like us, how are they different, what can we learn from their lives?<br />These are the constellation of questions that rattle around in my head after watching the movie and the shovelware in the second DVD.<br />For the simple answer it is the difference between \\"JUST US\\" and \\"JUSTICE\\" and the people behind each.<br />There is a central scene, where DiCaprio kneels at a rough Roman Catholic altar, Day-Lewis for his part kneels on a bench covered with an American flag, while a very upper crust society family prays over a elaborate loaded dinner table. Part of the scene is a view of the irony of prayer to a Diety where each participant immediately arises with blood on his mind and calmly, fervently tries to kill the others. But i would rather look at the volcano that each person represents and how the emotions which cry for justice are channelled by institutions reflecting particular ideologies as these people explode into the historical world where it becomes visible to us living 150 years later.<br />The force and power of the volcano is the human cry for justice, tainted by the demand for vengence, for blood for blood spilt.<br />It is evident in us as we view the movie, take up sides, cheer as we would for our hometown sports team, we feel these emotions inside us as they play out on the screen. But as they play out on the mean bloody streets of NewYork these emotions are manipulated, channelled, controlled, directed towards and away from by institutions, by ideologies, by people with a plan. Our history is a result of the playing out of various power groups, different ideas, cultures as they mixed and swirl inside people and explode into the streets on occasions like this but more often quietly work out their magic in the motivation of hands as they try to build a place to live, work and worship. That is the genius of this film, it characterizes the power centers of this time and place well enough that we can identify and understand a little of what must have gone on in those long past days.  Yet influencing our times as evident in the final scene where the skyline of NewYork grows in the background as the foreground of the graves changes little, symbolizes the watchful dead eyes of the past over our present.<br />Go see it for yourself, worth the time which passes quickly, leaving you with questions about our institutions and our ancestors.crust society family prays over a elaborate loaded dinner table.

0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is a very different book than Ender's Game, and I believe it is even better. It continues the story, albeit 3,000 years later, of one of the great all-time literary characters, Ender Wiggin. He is now a Speaker for the Dead, a position that entails learning about the life of the dead person he has been called to speak for, and revealing their life to others as truthfully as if they could see the persons thoughts. The speaking, akin to a funeral oration, doesn't only focus on positive actions, but also on the desires and wishes that may have never come to fruition. Inherent in the position of Speaker is the belief that you don't have to gloss over what is ugly and abhorent in order to see the beauty in a person. In fact it is necessary. Speaker for the Dead also deals with the communication problems between humans and an alien race, but in doing this Card makes an incredibly eloquent statement about communication with anything or anyone that is &quot;alien&quot; to us. If I had to recommend one Science Fiction book for any young adult or teenager to read, it would be Ender's Game. For adults it would be Speaker for the Dead.
1577311523|5.0|The power of death bed conversions recognizes the fact of the now, and the importance of the soul of each human being that supercedes the convention of society and how expectations guide the things that stir our souls, the moral spirituality that honors the life within, the the heart that beats with less time than it had yesterday. Death bed conversions honors the total person that forsees a time when the body no longer serves the soul, but is frail and helpless in its humanity. The inspiration that allows a person to be, and feel alive, is one that is intensely personal, and one that has a uniquely subjective outlook designed to maximize the moment, as the dying swans's extended overture of an end game of enormous proportions, the experience of many before us.  The inspiration to extend the earthly time to accomplish both bodily and mindfully important tasks meant to appease the soul of any individual in his or her capacity to influence the vision of his or her surroundings before life drifts into the oblivion of being erased. It relies not upon the acceptance of others but the recognition that what good or help might be completed is far superior to the desires or expectations of others who might limit, curtail, or prevent that instinctively agressive human impetus - to full personal objectives, according to one's own internal clock as seen from the perception of life in its full contemplation of limits, and consistent with one's own priorities. This exercise of the free will is incredibly important and a part of the human experience that reveals the instinctive man or women struggling to fulfill its total mission on earth, to achieve the serenity that will allow it to disappear in honor, respect, and dignity, the ideal of every human being destined to disappear in his or her own good time. This soul clock is untamed by man or religion since it conceives its intent from one's own self perception of possibilities and potential, played out upon the abbreviated passing of time that is allocated to each of us. Hence, the inspired rushes through to accomplish everything possible since haste forecloses both complacency and the untimeliness of those before us, built into our instinctive sense of time. So, we challenge the propriety of inconsistency or incongruency of spiritual risk to develop fully the human potential of our destiny or what we feel is our destiny by the vibrations which flow through us. Life being somewhat uncertain, the body and the soul clock each attune themselves to each other to accomplish this human mission, hopefully with time to spare. It is God's gift, this instinct for survival, for mission and for directive, a self help unique to each individual, aware of his own frailty and of his own potential, at once, his personal collage of significance, all too aware of his or her personal contract with his maker, and in harmony.
B00005O5CM|4.0|As someone who worked at the HLS back a long time ago, I never thought I'd ever watch Legally Blonde.  But it was about the only DVD available immediately from... DVD rental program, so I received it yesterday and watched it last night.  Even though it's totally silly and the production appears quite \\"amateurish,\\" I had some good laughs.  Plus, Reese is totally my favorite actress now, so I'm going to watch the sequel this weekend.<br />Since Harvard has a policy prohibiting filming on its campus, LB was filmed somewhere else, either in a studio or some other university campus.  HLS students are portrayed as a stuffy and weird, which is not what I observed while working there (yes, they tended to be obnoxious nonetheless), but this stereotype works well as a backdrop for Elle Woods's silly innocence.  She's like the white swan among black geese, the only pure thing in a pretentious and competitive environment.  The script is totally stupid, but decent comedy acting helps make the movie quite entertaining.  Everyone was surprised that we didn't waste our time after all.
0553812173|3.0|Steven Erikson made a very interesting debut with Gardens of the Moon. The sheer scope of the story and the magnitude of his creation are indeed staggering, with a cast rivalling War&amp;Peace. Erikson's writing is above par, his descriptions vibrant, and his anthropologic and archaeologic knowledge garnered from his professional life show in this book.<BR>On to the flaws: Erikson makes liberal and quite literal use of the dreaded deus ex machina, involving the gods themselves if need be to save a given situation. Though his writing is very good, words like &quot;grin&quot; and expressions like &quot;must needs&quot; and &quot;one and all&quot; are quite prolific, and on occasion detract from the reading through ad nauseam repetition. The plot is somewhat clumsy, and Erikson on more than one occasion seemed not to know how to get a situation to happen, resorting to the abovementioned deus ex machina or a set of totally random events. Erikson's work has been classified by some as &quot;power fantasy&quot;, and I can't say I disagree. The characters are very powerful, and they seem to gain more powers like Dragonball characters, frequently through mere happenstance. Some might like it, others not.<BR>That said, I still think it's a good book, I've bought the other three volumes and I look forward to the next. Not excellent, not very good, but definetly good and worth the paperback price. It makes for an enjoyable read and is definetly superior to most other recent fantasy books.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Top Gun the Motion Picture Soundtrack (1986). Remastered in 1999 with bonus tracks. <br />For the most part, movie soundtracks have always had their high spots, but oftentimes fail to be consistent from front to back. That is, until the movie Top Gun came out. Featuring a score by Harold Faltermeyer, Tom Whitlock, Giorgio Moroder, and several famous rock/pop artists, the Top Gun soundtrack became the first truly phenomenal rock movie compilation, and a definitive 80's music staple. It conjurs up the best parts of the mid-80's music scene while throwing away any real cheeziness that many people often associate with the period, making this a great introduction to a better time in rock music history. This was how I was introduced, so let's take a look at each of this disc's fifteen tracks: <br />1) Danger Zone (Kenny Loggins)- An awesome melodic, fast, hard rock number, and one of the two tracks off of here which became popular. Loggins has always crafted some great rockers in the past for other movies (Footloose, Caddyshack), and this one is no exception. 10/10 <br />2) Mighty Wings (Cheap Trick)- Another melodic fast hard rocker, yet much different from anything Cheap Trick has been known to do. This one is one of my favorites, yet strangely it was never popular. Excellent guitar solo. 10/10 <br />3) Playing With The Boys (Kenny Loggins)- Loggins has another fast one, though this track is more of a happy party pop number. Good, but not great. 8/10 <br />4) Lead Me On (Teena Marie)- An upbeat, driving, mid-tempo track which proves to be very strong, coming from a somewhat popular artist at the time. Great passionate vocals. 9/10 <br />5) Take My Breath Away (Berlin)- Top Gun's slow, melodic, and powerful love theme, this track became one of the most famous ballads of the 80's, and with good reason. 10/10 <br />6) Hot Summer Nights (Miami Sound Machine)- A bouncy party pop song. This shows MSM's sound before Gloria Estephan joined and brought them fame. Not as good asthe others, but definitely worthwhile. 8/10 <br />7) Heaven In Your Eyes (Loverboy)- Another great ballad, this time done by Loverboy, who were normally known for their party rock songs. Therefore this song might seem a bit different than what their fans may be used to. Still, it proves to be excellent. 9/10 <br />8) Through The Fire (Larry Greene)- This track is more like Danger Zone and Mighty Wings in its sheer power and speed. Apparently, Larry Greene wasn't a very popular artist and his works can only be found on here and on the Over The Top soundtrack. Such a shame his career never took off like the others. 10/10 <br />9) Destination Unknown (Marietta)- Very melodic, yet upbeat number which stands out moreso than some of the other tracks. Like Larry Greene, Marietta is also a very little known artist, and her song here is the only song of hers that I know of. 10/10 <br />10) Top Gun Anthem (Harold Faltermeyer/Steve Stevens)- Here's the movie's main theme played in the beginning, though the version on here is accompanied by the guitarist Steve Stevens of Billy Idol fame. A very catchy instrumental. 9/10<br />And the bonus tracks:<br />11) Dock Of The Bay (Otis Redding)- These new bonus tracks introduce the slower, oldies songs which came from various parts of the movie. This song is quite mellow and memorable. 8/10 <br />12) Memories (Harold Faltermeyer)- Another instrumental, this one is very sad and melodic, reflecting a rather mournful scene in the movie. 9/10<br />13) Great Balls Of Fire (Jerry Lee Lewis)- A real oldies classic, though the actual song wasn't in the film. Instead, it was sung by several characters. 9/10<br />14) You've Lost That Loving Feeling (The Righteous Brothers)- An oldies love ballad, which although fairly popular when it first came out, was made more famous by its inclusion in the movie. Very good. 9/10<br />15) Playing With The Boys Dance Remix (Kenny Loggins)- Basically an enhanced version of the original song. It becomes longer, and therefore benefits the track. 9/10<br />To this day, the Top Gun soundtrack stands tall as one of the best compilations to ever be put out, especially with a songwriting team of Faltermeyer, Whitlock, and Moroder. I give this soundtrack my highest recommendation to anyone who even remotely likes rock music. Even if you've never heard of any of the artists featured on here, you still won't go wrong with this disc. Add to that a linear notes interview with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and you have a near-perfect package.
B00008OWZC|5.0|No words can describe how great this collection of live recordings is!  Great guitar licks, Robert's voice is more alive than on any of the studio albums and Bonzo comes banging back to life again.  What more could anyone ask for?  To just write that it's excellent is NOT enough.<br />Why has it taken sooooooo long for this to come out?  <BR>Truly phenomenal!
B00005JM09|5.0|Let me start out by saying that this third installment of the Terminator is the best yet.  The film has no problem of course with causing plenty of mayhem and delivers non-stop action throughout.  But, the movie also succeds in putting in some drama and it works very effectively making this the best movie of the year so far.<br />Arnold is back and better than ever after coming out with a few medicore movies (End of Days, 6th Day, Collateral Damage), he does the right thing and goes back to the role that pretty much defined his career.  But the formula is tweaked by adding in a female cyborg against him (Kristanna Loken).  Also, the chemistry between Nick Stahl and Claire Danes is terrific and really adds to the already fabulous movie.<br />The movie is great not only because of the amazing car chase scene early in the film, but that's a big part of the equation because really, the Terminator movies are just one big chase scene, but new director Jonathan Mostow handles it just as good, if not better than James Cameron did by creating an exiting atmosphere and more action than 3 other summer movies have combined.<br />BOTTOM LINE:  If you liked the first two Terminator movies or any Schwarnenegger movies at all, you'll love this 3rd installment to a great movie franchise. (5 stars out of 5)
B00001IVOF|5.0|Mobb Deep knows how to keep it real. <BR>Following their previous album \\"The Infamous\\" this guys are back stronger & more hardcore than ever.  This is the first album I heard from Mobb Deep, back in 1996 when it came out and I was really impressed.  <BR>Prodigy & Havoc wreak hell with the beats & lyrics here.  From the beginning with \\"Animal Instinct\\" till the end with \\"Apostle Warning,\\" they describe pretty much how the life on the ghetto is.  Here you will hear violence described to the fullest, as Havoc details on track #5, one of my favorites \\"More Trife Life\\" by being betrayed, hurt, and abused.<BR>My favorite track is #11, \\"Hell On Earth.\\"  Prodigy keeps it strong & real the whole way through.<BR>In a short summary.  If you like real rap, hardcore stuff, this is what you need.  If you like real beats & straight out lyrics, this is the cd that you need.<BR>On the other hand, if you don't think you can handle violence, explicit lyrics & the rest, then I suggest you stay away.<BR>This is real rap, the real thing...not any of that new [stuff] that's playing today on your local radio station.  <BR>If you want commercialized rap, the one with the \\"tin tin\\" and little bells, gold teeth, ying-yang clap clap & southern stuff, then I suggest you look elsewhere.
0671578855|5.0|I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, the dinner scene in this book is the highlight.  That being said, the rest of the book is still absolutely great in the expected Bujold style.  Miles is definitely settling into life without the Dendarii and finally becoming real Vorkosigan while actually seeming to enjoy it.  If you are looking for shoot-em-up, this is not the book for you.  If you are looking for character interaction, twists, turns, and triumph in the manner in which you've become accustomed to from Bujold, get it.  True fans won't regret it.
B00004XQP4|5.0|A lot of people hated Warning but that's only because most people are very close-minded. This is Green Day grown up, and I love what they are doing. Anyone who hates this album didn't get or understand albums like 39/Smooth, Kerplunk, or even Dookie. Every song is very catchy, and I love every one of them. Some of my favorites are Macy's Day Parade, Misery, Waiting, Blood Sex and Booze, and Minority. A lot of people dismissed Minority as a \\"trendy\\" song, but that is only because people didn't realize that the song isn't just about wanting to be different, but it's also a personal statement about the band, and how they are breaking away from all other punk genres. That's for the lyrics, even I have to admit I had a problem with the sound to the song becaue it sounded WAY to much like an old Drop Kick Murphys song, but that's ok if I try not to think about it. Regradless, this CD is awesome, and if you don't like it, that's one thing, but to call Green Day sell outs, you are out of your mind and don't know what the hell you're talking about. Ok so it's not AS punk as their old stuff, but who cares?! Enjoy the cd for what it is.
B000003TAW|4.0|I have to say, initially, I felt very guilty listening to this album. When I describe my musical tastes, and my thoughts about my musical taste, the words \\"elitist\\" or \\"pretentious\\" come to mind. Although I prefer the former, most would probably call me the latter. My favorite bands consist of The Shins, Wilco, Modest Mouse, and Spoon. With bands like that usually coming from my stereo, one can imagine the tide of guilt that washed over me when I stuck this into my CD player. When the song \\"My Name is Jonas\\" played, I shrunk in my chair. I thought I was listening to Z100, or watching MTV...through my CD player. The songs were void of the often pretentious, esoteric lyrics found in my regular bands (the prime example: Modest Mouse). It was complete pop-rock, but not in the way The Shins are pop rock. It was incredibly radio-friendly pop-rock, the kind played by Blink-182 and other definative pop-rock bands of our time. I bought the CD because I wanted something loud, but with a pop-sensability (like The Shins, only a little louder), and I feared I had gone too far and bought a \\"pop\\" album.<BR>However, as the hours past, the album seemed less terrible (terrible out of my pretentious principles). The hooks were catchier then the flu, but a good flu. The lyrics were lacking, oh boy were they lacking (\\"something is bubbling behind my butt,\\" \\"the sea is foamy like a bottle of beer,\\" does more need to be said?), but really, the whole reason I bought this album was to get some polished, easy-listening, loud, happy music. While Weezer is not on some incredibly profound or insightful level, they are able to generate some of the catchiest songs I have ever heard. While many (not all) face the problem of sounding the same, it doesn't take away that much from the album (a little more variation and better lyrics would have given it five stars).<br />Some 1-star reviewer tells us to go listen to \\"better bands\\" such as Modest Mouse, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Built to Spill. What he fails to mention is that all of those bands are some of the most angst-ridden bands in music's history. Now riddle me this: why the hell would somebody razz a CD of upbeat, happy music and then (not recommend another \\"happy\\" band which he thought was better) tell us to listen to the \\"Titans from Planet Angst.\\" I love Modest Mouse, but damn man, don't recommend that band in place of Weezer's Blue Album--it's like apples and oranges! Is Modest Mouse a better band then Weezer? Technically, yes. Is Claude Debussy more talented then Wilco? Yes, but I still like Wilco more then I'll ever like Debussy. Keep it in context.<br />Anyway, for what it does, Weezer's Blue Album is pretty damn good. Of course there are plenty of bands I like more and think are, well, better, but for happy music, Weezer is one of the best(well, in my opinion, it comes in 2nd place to R.E.M.'s 'Out of Time' in the happiness factor, but who cares).
B00005JKZU|5.0|This followup to Fellowship of the Ring is superb. It moves a little fast at times, but the storytelling is incomparable. The acting is very good, and we get to see a different side of the relationships in the fellowship.<br />Once again, the special effects are amazing, and the cinematography is breathtaking. <br />I liked this installment in the Lord of the Rings better, or equal to to Fellowship of the Ring. This continuation becomes a little darker, and ends on a note of foreshadowing.<br />I love this movie, and would reccomend adding this movie to your collection.
B00000AFDW|5.0|Like past reviews have stated, this is not a copy of \\"Love Gun\\". It is a KISS album, there is no question about that, but it's not the four members going into the studio to record together. KISS have always gone for quality in everything they have recorded. They know they can use outside muscians on an album and make it better. The fact is, Peter Criss is not the best drummer. Kevin Valentine puts in a good performance and their might even be some Eric Singer in the mix. KISS albums have been made using outside muscians since \\"Dynasty\\". It's the way KISS records. In my mind, it is still KISS 100%. Instruments are not the only thing a band puts into a record. Writing the songs is just as important. This is a great addition to KISS's catalog. It is far better then Aerosmith's latest album \\"Just Push Play\\". KISS is still the ultimate American classic heavy metal band.
B000068G9X|5.0|I am not really that into metal but when I read about how much people with similar tastes to mine loved this album I decided I'd give it a try.  I haven't heard any of Danzig's other releases but I am sure to sometime because this album really truly impressed me.  I'd say this album is more of a 4.5 on my scale but I guess I'll round up.  Glenn Danzig is a great frontman, just as he was with the seminal punk band The Misfits. I like the southern rock influence on the album and it doesn't come off too metallish.  The lyrics are dark, but not in a demonic or evil sense, not that I really care about that.  The real great thing about the lyrics is how Glenn Danzig pulls them off.  Many a time during the album he comes off sounding sarcastic.  Now to get into the songs.  Mother is definately the most famous Danzig song and still gets much airplay on &quot;alternative rock&quot; stations, this is well deserved because it is one of the better songs on the album.  The best song on the album in my opinion though would have to be Twist Of Cain.  This song may be one of top fifty or so songs.  Other standout tracks include Evil Thing, She Rides, and Not Of This World.  There is really not a weak track on this album and its pretty easy to play in its entirity with every listen.  I'd definately recommend this for anyone remotely interested in metal and most definately the avid metal fan.
B00005YW4H|1.0|My wife and I had never heard of Norah Jones until the day after the Grammys this year when she carted home all sorts of trinkets.  My wife assumed that winning the best pop artist award would signify a good pop album and thus picked up the disc.  Wrong.  Norah is a beautiful young woman and has a lovely voice, but the songs just have no spark.  It was like listening to CSPAN with a piano.  I can only assume that she received attention and overhype due to her father Ravi Shankar who was idolized by the Beatles (George Harrison in particular).  But that connection doesn't make you great.<br />I hope Norah ups the tempo on her next CD (it won't be hard to do) and maybe we can see what type of Pop Chops she has.  But her career has Lauren Hill and Taste of Honey potential, so I hope she enjoys the success she's getting.  I know I'll enjoy my sleep after listening to this.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'll admit it - I was under the impression that I was NOT a Christina fan and never would be. Boy, I was wrong... after one listen to this album, I was hooked. This CD literally goes wherever I go. Whether it may be at home, work, in the car, working out, school, everywhere. Her vocal range is amazing. No. More than that. It's indescribable. I love the combination of pop, rock and a little jazz, and who could forget her ballads? <BR>I feel the title for this album fits like a glove. The lyrics come from Christina and describe her life and what she's going through, at the same time giving inspiration to her listeners, not to mention some GREAT dance tunes! My faves on the album include Cruz, Get Mine Get Yours, Walk Away, Underappreciated, and Dirrty.<BR>For those of you contemplating on buying the CD, take my advice... I thought I would NEVER end up listening to one of her CD's and here I have it playing practically 24/7. It's great for any mood you're in and well worth every penny.
0441003257|5.0|This book is a laugh-out-loud funny book.  That's how hilarious it is.  I would recommend it to anyone and I mean anyone.  It's not an easy reader like most fantasy books and it has a different sort of read about it, but once you get going you'll love it, too.  <br />This is about the armageddon.  The child of evil or whatever gets switched at birth and a devil and an angel try to find him and influence him to do what is right in their minds.  There are a lot of mishaps and crazy stuff that happens.  It's great.<br />Now, you need to read the footnotes, though, because they're the best part.  But I really would recommend this book.  It's good.
B00000IQW0|4.0|The original story of a tribe of humans escaping extinction by a robotic race bent on annihilation of the human race. The original theatrical release with amazing special effects for the late 70's. I was never a Star Wars fan, but this series led me into the Star Trek craze and I am grateful for the clean family entertainment that I now show my own kids. Too bad the SciFi Channel wants to bring it back with two bimbos playing Starbuck and Apollo & turn the whole thing into a... freakshow. <br />BAN SCI-FI CHANNEL AND THEIR SPONSERS NOW!!!!!
B00008O0WN|5.0|The thing that sets Star Trek apart from other movies and movie &quot;franchises&quot; for so many is the love that seems to come through in its production, and the treasure of a cast.  It would be easy to toss off a product to the rapt &quot;Trekkies&quot; every few years and keep making money, but you can tell these people care about sharing their vision and fascination.<br />Picard and Data (more accurately, the actors behind them, Stewart and Spiner) move the plot in this film, though the whole crew has become something of a pantheon where they don't need to be at the forefront to serve the plot.  The best Next Generation episodes involved the humanist introspection of Picard, and this movie showcases Picard's unique style of courage.  Sure the jokes and setup can be corny but this is just to disarm us before getting on to the weighty.  The interactions between Picard, Data, and death make this movie great not just as a Star Trek but as an attempt at helping us navigate modern life.

B00008MNYS|4.0|I wasn't even a Robbie Williams fan, until I saw appearances of him on [NBC's] \\"'Last Call' w/Carson Daly\\" and [CBS'] \\"'The Late Late Show' w/Craig Kilborn.\\" I approched this CD with trepidation. I was a little skeptical of his music from the beginning from what some people have been saying about his peculiar-personality, with his \\"over-the-top\\" impromptu-stunts he exucutes on some TV shows, and in his music-videos on VH1 and MTV. Contrary to popular belief, I come to like this guy. He has a good-sense of humor, with an amicable-personality and is so down-to-earth. \\"Escapology\\" is the highly-anticipated album to hit store shelves in a while, it's one of the best CD's of his I've listened to thus far. I'd never even heard about Robbie William's music before, until I purchased this album - on a whim - at a \\"Virgin Megastore\\" in Tempe, AZ. I've been listening to this CD a lot, I really enjoy it.<br />This British Import is a brilliant singer/songwriter, he puts so much effort and raw-emotion into every one of his songs. He's got this sassy, resplendent-sounding voice.   <BR>\\"Feel\\" is on of my favorite tracks on the album. The chorus is so beautiful, it goes a little something like this: \\"I just want to feel real love, feel the home that I live in. 'Cause I got too much life running through my veins going to waste. And I need to feel real love, and a life ever-after. I cannot give it up.\\" The song's about doing some soul-searching with ones life, looking for that true-love, which seems to elude a lot of us single-guys (myself included) out there in the world, today. \\"Sexed Up\\" is about a guy wanting to break-up with his girlfriend. \\"Get high\\" is some cryptic-message (which a lot of Robbie's lyrics contain) about drug-use. I was cracking-up when I listened to \\"Me And My Monkey.\\" \\"Nan's Song\\" is this beautiful heart-felt ballad, guitar-solo, with the string-tinge; it's so relaxing. There are so many good songs on this album. Overall, \\"Escapology\\" is a nice reprieve...a good album to listen to.

B000002KK2|5.0|Rickie Lee's self-titled debut album is essential listening for anyone who considers themselves a fan of jazz, female singer-songwriters, or plain old good music. <BR>When this album hit the marketplace at the tail end of the 70's it was truly an oasis in what had become a rather boring era of music. Punk and disco had both burned themselves out, and the California singer/songwriter movement was on its last leg. There wasn't anything that could be considered &quot;fresh&quot; on the radio. And then, out of nowhere, came &quot;Chuck E's In Love&quot;, heralding the advent of the most original artist of the era.<BR>&quot;RLJ&quot; is primarily guitar based (Pirates, released 2 years later, would confirm the multi-instrumental power of Rickie), and the songs are so brilliant that as I write this, 25 years after this album was released, I can still play this music and think how fresh the sound remains. That's a testament to Rickie's writing and playing, which remain unmatched by any modern singer.<BR>&quot;Weasel And the White Boys Cool&quot;, a song about an acquaintance (Sal Bernardi), who would later become a lover remains my favorite from this disc. The guitar work on this song is incredible, and Rickie's vocals are playful and gorgeous. And her lyrics, while sometimes unintelligible upon first listen (the hiccuppy nature of her vocals, and her habit of eliding full syllables may turn off some listeners, but they are one of her most endearing traits), are as strong as any writer of popular music.<br />&quot;Company&quot; is a cabaret classic, and songs of longing like this tune fit Rickie's voice perfectly. This song has been covered many times since its release (Melissa Errico being the most recent), but nobody can capture Rickie's emotions while singing this tune.<BR>&quot;Danny's All Star Joint&quot; is a genuine romp - its a shame Rickie doesn't play this song (and it's sister pieces, &quot;Woody and Dutch&quot; from Pirates, and &quot;Juke Box Fury&quot; from &quot;The Magazine&quot;) more often in live shows. Rickie has an incredible way with uptempo pieces of this nature, and they are sorely missed on discs such as &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot;.<BR>&quot;Last Chance Texaco&quot; will break your heart if you ponder its meaning, and musically, it has to be one of the saddest uses of the guitar ever recorded. There is genuine heartbreak in this song, and no one conveys this type of feeling as well as Rickie.<BR>&quot;Coolsville&quot; and &quot;Easy Money&quot; are wonderful songs, with what sound at first listen like incredibly simple arrangements. It is only after repeated listenings (and this album deserves such repeated listening) that the subtle complexities in the instrumentation, vocals and harmonies are revealed.<BR>It still amazes me that an album this perfect was a debut release. And amazes me even further that she was able to avoid a spohmore slump by offering up the even more brilliant &quot;Pirates&quot;. She is, in my opinion, the best singer of my generation, and a must-own for any serious music fan.
B000003S0I|3.0|... by which I mean in comparison with their live performances. Musically, this is a complex, disturbing album; however, to my ears the production, although clear and forward, is rather dead and cramped sounding. And frankly, both parts of &quot;Larks Tongues&quot; need to be speeded up. <br />Listen to the the live set &quot;The Night Watch&quot; to hear just how capable these guys were of taking off. As it is, the sound here remains earthbound. <br />The best moments are the mosaic-like &quot;Lark's Tongues Part 1&quot;  and the lovely ballad &quot;Book Of Saturday&quot;. <br />One more thing. Despite being praised to the skies for his eccentric genius, Jamie Muir's percussion sounds to me like a man falling down a flight of stairs.
0440236304|5.0|The successful book and mini-series _Band of Brothers_ prompted a re-read of Donald R. Burgett's timeless classic: Currahee: A Screaming Eagle in Normandy (the subtitle was added to the reprint editions). First published in 1967, Burgett was ahead of his time in paving the way for a no holes barred narrative and chilling memoir.  Some of the more recent World War II memoirs will attest that there are several pit-falls awaiting the well intentioned autobiographer. For example, a combat veteran's world was very small. He was rarely aware of events transpiring outside the realm of his squad or platoon. He oftentimes knew not where he was, nor was he aware of the grand strategy of which his unit was a small yet intricate part. All he knew was that he had to keep going on to victory, not so much for his country as a whole, but for his buddies who depended on him, as he relied on them for survival. Also, there is a tendency for the humorous memories to over-shadow the horrors of war in many recent accounts. The result is often a personal anecdotal approach. Although this style is significant to understanding the culture of the World War II veteran, it can also bore the reader quickly. Not so with Burgett's first effort. Burgett blends the anecdotal with the overall picture splendidly. He made a smart decision to have a military historian edit his manuscript and fill in the holes with facts Burgett could not possibly have known at the time. This collaboration is done with finesse, lending just enough factual military history to Burgett's personal experiences to make for a riveting read (This delicate ingredient will become more abundant in Burgett's subsequent installments). Burgett takes the reader from paratrooper training, overseas deployment, and eventual night drop into Normandy on the eve of the D-Day invasion. His attention to detail is remarkable. Every facet of training from the technical to the ironic is covered with crystal clear prose. If it were not for an injury suffered during Burgett's first qualifying jump, he would have crashed and burned with his original stick in an unfortunate training accident. Burgett's acclimation to combat appears to occur rapidly. He soon learns to think like an infantryman: is this ditch a safe place to spend the night, he wonders, or does the enemy have it zeroed-in? Burgett soon learned to trust no one outside his circle of squad buddies in the second squad, second platoon of A Company, 506th Parachute Infantry, 101st Airborne Division. He would make the grateful French citizens drink the wine and cider they happily offered their liberators first to insure it was not poisoned. Thinking three moves ahead in the game of survival became a way of life for Burgett. Burgett's re-telling of the sporadic fire fights among the hedgrows of Normandy are vital to a thorough understanding of the Airborne operations on D-Day. The reader may wonder whether the paratroopers preference for screaming frontal assaults directly into the mouths of German machine guns and deadly artillery is the result of elite combat training or youthful bravado (Burgett was only nineteen). Burgett makes no bones about his macabre desire to scalp the blond locks from a dead German soldier he felled with his M-1 Garrand. Only intense enemy machine gun fire prevented him from performing this gruesome deed. Burgett comments on the one topic no one likes to talk about: friendly fire. Burgett tells us that not only were his comrades killed by mishaps during Allied air and artillery support missions, but also short rounds fired from ships off-shore as well. Without a doubt, Burgett's tell-it-like-was memoir will become a timeless classic. All veterans contemplating preserving their experiences to paper should consult Burgett as a model.ury suffered during Burgett's first qualifying jump, he would have crashed and burned with his original stick in an unfortunate training accident.

0871137380|1.0|The hype that the movie Black Hawk Down received prior to its release encouraged me to read the book: a fatal mistake.  The book is as groan inducing as the movie and this is mainly because it spends so little time with character development that it's hard to care about the outcome and feel sorrow at the deaths of the soldiers.  Action buffs who enjoyed the movie often criticize me by saying that this is a true account of an actual event, but even so this does not make the book any more exciting for me to read.  If you are interested in knowing of what happened in Mogadishu, read the book, otherwise, steer clear of it as you would any other mindless action book/movie.
B0000026WD|4.0|I love this album it had some of the hottest tunes in the early 90s. Everything Michael touches is a succes except for his personal life. Dangerous is a great pop record hitting the hottest hits. Jam, RemeMber the Time, Black or White, my favorite Who is It are all great tracks. These are the many few albums of the 90s you can listen to without fowarding each track.
0375422307|5.0|This story is nicely depicting the true events happening in Iran after revolution. I, as a person who grew up with the same situation, totally enjoyed reading this book.<br />I strongly recommend this book to every Iranian (or non Iranian) who has left Iran, and been through the bloody war.
B000001E18|5.0|This is definitely U2's most experimental album, and after repeated listenings, it is perhaps there most rewarding.  Never has U2 been less self conscious, or more creative.  Songs like Lemon, Numb and Zooropa bring a new color ro the U2 fold.  Certainly, Zooropa is not their most accesible album, nor will fans of light Pop or mindless music appreciate the beauty of this album.  Highly recomended for those that were intrigued by Achtung Baby's darker side.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have read The Lord of the Rings trilogy many, many times. It has been my favorite book for almost as long as I can remember- I was very skeptical about the LOTR movies at first but as soon as I saw the Fellowship of the Ring,I immediately became a huge fan. Of course I noticed when the film strayed from the book, but who can blame anyone? Tolkien's writings are much too deep to film. A true, \\"pure\\" movie made from the books would take hours and hours. I think the few additions that are not in the book help support the story's structure, add suspense and put a little more into the story that are a surprise for everybody: even those who know the book inside and out.<BR>I think Peter Jackson and the rest of the people involved have done an AMAZING job of translating a virtually untranslatable story. And I don't mind that there are things left out!(maybe this makes me not a Tolkien Purist, but I do know the books like my backyard. It's impossible for anyone to know everything about them like the back of your hand, forgive me if twisting a cliche is illegal.)<br />P.S. The actors also did an amazing job!
B000021YQV|4.0|toxicity is a pretty good album, its alot better than their first album that cam out. My favorite songs from this album are: prison song, needles, chop suey! and toxicity. i gave each song their own rating:<br />prison song 9/10: kinda of a weird song but its interesting, once again serj makes his wild screams<br />needles: 9/10: this song is pretty cool. the lyrics are awesome!<br />deer dance 6/10: this song is kinda of stupid. the bridge on it makes it worth listening to<br />jet pilot 5/10: this song is the worst song on the album. this album wuld be better if they left this song out.<br />x 6/10: a short song that has weird lyrics. the music is pretty good though.<br />chop suey 10/10: this is the best song on the album. i like the bridge the best.<br />bounce 6/10: this song is really weird. serj sounds like a prep on this song.<br />forest 9/10: this is the longest song on the album and its pretty good too.<br />atwa 8/10: on the beginning of this song they kinda sound like led zepplin. but overall its a good song<br />science 8/10: this song is okay. it has a good guitar solo on it.<br />shimmy 6/10: weird song!!! with more of serj's crazy screams<br />toxicity: 10/10: this the second best song on the album. the guitar on it is awesome!!<br />phsyco 9/10: this song has a nice beat and helpful lyrics<br />aerials 6/10: this song is overplayed on the radio alot and wat the heck is up with the closing!!! <br />overall this is an album worth buying
B000000OUE|5.0|Few albums of the last twenty years have the effect on the human nervous system that this one does. From the first time you hear snippets of it until the day that you buy your own copy nothing is the same. Like a virus this CD spreads through infecting any and all who come into it's path.<br />This may be the perfect metal/industrial/art album of the 1990's. From snippets of classic movies to spine tingling bass rhythms that will cause your blood to boil this album has everything. It's an album that divides the world into two groups: those who get it and those who don't.<br />It's the strongest album that Rob Zombie may ever have his name attached to. I think it blows away the earlier White Zombie album and makes his solo albums pale by comparison. It's comparable to so many great albums. I hate to call it a watermark but it's a label that fits well. <br />I always compare this album to a first kiss. Not a first kiss that is sweet or chaste or grows soft with the passage of time. This cd is like that first kiss that made you feel sweaty, hot and hungry at the first time. That kiss that wasn't like anything you ever got from your grandmother. This is that first kiss that hinted of things that, no matter how much trouble you got into, it was worth it. It's the kiss that made you realize how cool it is to have someone want to kiss you like that.<br />Maybe this will work: It's a kiss that combines power tools, short skirts, glistening sweat, leather, electricity, fast cars, stocking with seams and all the other things that your parents warned you about in one big shiny package. If that doesn't convince you to buy this album nothing ever will.<br />I own over 2000 CD's that range from classical to techno, country to ska. This CD is in the top ten.
0060207051|5.0|In our family \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has recently become a \\"read-every-night book.\\" As the bunny calmly says goodnight to everything inside and outside the window, our children seem to feel a comforting sense of predictability, security and peace as they wind down for sleep. Part of our current bedtime ritual also includes pointing out the mouse in each color illustration. My husband and I enjoy reading books with our two sons, ages 3 and 5. Many are simply for pure fun and enjoyment together. However, we have also found that some books serve as a wonderful opportunity for us to continue teaching a lesson about our family rules and values. We often calmly revisit a situation with our boys, away from the heat of the moment of their embarrassing angry behavior (by reading \\"Elbert's Bad Word\\" or \\"How Are You Peeling?\\"; or we may wish to prepare ahead of time for a situation (by reading \\"Daddy, Will You Miss Me?\\"). When we are unsure of the appropriate words to use, a book can ofte! n get the point or lesson across to a young child in just the right way. Sometimes, the text or pictures can encourage the child to ask questions or make comments, thereby giving you a clearer sense of his understanding. Then you can focus further discussion as needed. We found an awesome annotated listing of excellent books to read with 2- to 5-year-olds in \\"The Pocket Parent\\". This pocket-sized A-Z compendium addresses many hot-button subjects and includes more than 100 recommended picture books to broach sensitive or worrisome issues with your preschoolers--such as Anger, Bedtime, Bad Words, Biting, Death, Gimmes, \\"I Hate You's\\", Lying, Mealtime, Morning Crazies, The New Baby, Strangers, Thumb sucking, Tantrums, Whining and more. Reading appropriate books, like \\"Goodnight Moon\\", is definitely one effective way to establish comforting routines with the children while keeping lines of communication open to discuss concerns and solve problems together when needed.
0790730960|5.0|The Dark Knight Bruce Wayne/Batman makes a roaring return in the second outing in the legendary Batman trilogy in a darker & much colder undertone with the mysterious hero now up against two menacing villains. One is a corrupt company CEO named Max Schrek (Christopher Walken) and the other is a deformed murderer named Oswald Cobblepot aka Penguin. A third rival character in this movie is difficult to categorize as a villain or a hero. That is the twisted seductive Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Although I don't categorize her as a dangerous murderess, it's very difficult to really say if she's truly a villainess but it's easy to say that she isn't exactly the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of heroism but on the other hand, she's an extremely complex character whose eccentric personality renders one unable to help but really pay a lot of attention to her. <br />The movie begins in the cold snowy & remote stretches of a haunted mansion somewhere I'm guessing in upper New York state where a couple are the parents of a young but very odd child. The oddness of the child becomes highly evident after he pulls a cat into his cage and presumably killing it. Unable to handle the psychological burden of raising him, the Cobblepots toss him in his crib into the river and flee into the unknown. Many years later on, Cobblepot also known as the Penguin, runs in the election for the next mayor of Gotham City. The citizens though are unaware that he's actually plotting against the population and is in fact plotting to take over the city and kidnap the city's children. Meanwhile, The Penguin attracts the attention of a corrupt corporate CEO named Max Schrek (Christopher Walken), who wants to team up with him against `both' Bruce Wayne, and Batman, considering how much \\"they\\" oppose his plans for a toxic waste power plant. Schrek on the other hand also has to deal with a more vicious foe, and that is Catwoman, formerly Selina Kyle, a former employee who he had abused and triedto kill, and she is now out for revenge against him and also for competition against Batman. Now, with three major foes butting heads against him, Batman now has a dauntingly dangerous mission to stop the three from causing havoc and destruction across Gotham City and protect the citizens.  <br />All of the cast in this movie are superb beyond any words that I can muster up. Michael Keaton IS Bruce Wayne/Batman. Neither George Clooney, nor Val Kilmer (No offense to them. They did well too) could compete against Keaton in the role as the dark Knight Batman. Danny DeVito brings a truly chilling acting role that is worthy of remembrance with the deformed Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer brings the odd and often extremely complex character Catwoman to life. Christopher Walken is totally awesome playing the corrupt CEO of the Schrek Corporation.  Michael Gough is absolutely brilliant as Bruce Wayne's/Batman's caretaker and aide, Alfred and is the only one who I felt kept all of the talent of his acting intact throughout the entire movie series. Combine the brilliant cast with a dark and truly foreboding atmosphere, and you have what I considered Tim Burton's crowning achievement at this point in his career (Before he outdid himself with \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\") <br />I can easily remember how this movie seemed to shape this period in my life around late 1992 and early 1993 and now in its 11th year of existence, \\"Batman Returns\\" has lost none of it's power and continues to be a thought-provoking masterpiece. Tim Burton did stunningly well on the first Batman movie from 1989, but he blew me away with \\"Batman Returns\\". Although it may sound like \\"Returns\\" is better than the first one, it's actually a tight toss-up between the two movies. The first one has a more fun atmosphere combined with a dramatic overtone to it. The second one, has a much darker, much colder, and more bleak atmosphere. The two perfectly complement each other so well that one's movie collection would be incomplete without them. Although I thought \\"Batman Forever\\" was a great follow-up, the more flashy direction that the movie saga went into would sadly go in a nosedive, sacrificing the drama, thoughtful plot, and intelligent dialogue, for excessive hodgepodges of colors and excessive flamboyance, ultimately killing the movie series with the campy, god-awful P.O.S. that was \\"Batman And Robin\\". Even to this day, I still cannot believe that the Batman series went from the dark, brooding, drama of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\", and even the fun of \\"Batman Forever\\", down to just lowlife cinematic sewage that was \\"Batman & Robin\\". I just hope that Batman will recover soon and someday in the future, bring back the dark undertones that defined this incredible movie. Perhaps it was the stupidity of the entertainment industry at the time that they were disturbed at the `failure' of \\"Batman Returns\\" with \\"only\\" 280M dollars at the box office. I mean come on! 280M is HUGE! That's far fram a failure. It was when they turned Gotham City into a giant circus that caused the franchise to fail later on. It might have also been the stupidity of a large part of the audience that caused the franchise to die off later on after this movie. Of course for me, I was loving this movie when I was just ten years old when it came out, and loved far more than I `enjoyed' \\"Batman & Robin\\" when I was 14 when that came out. Even with all this I'm writing with this review, there's so much more from this movie that I can be able to explain with this review. The series would take a nosedive into campy oblivion later on in time but for me, give me the dark, dramatic, thought-provoking, and depth of \\"Batman Returns\\" anytime over the MGM grand flashy colors of \\"Batman & Robin\\".
0393057658|5.0|I was surprised at how great this book was. I had put this book near the top of my reading list. Soon after that, I read an excerpt that was from the middle of the book. Little did I know that it was probably one of slowest sections of the book, so I moved it down on my list. When talking with out attorney, he mentioned that the book was really good. The next day I started reading it -- and couldn't put it down. It was really good.<br />You get to know parts about baseball that are rarely covered. Even a non-baseball reader will come away being very informed and capable of passing it on to friends who might be sports freaks. Highly recommended.
0385504209|1.0|I guess I am alone in my opinion.  I thought the book<br />got off to a great beginning, and that I was really going<br />to love it. I was learning a ton about Opus Dei, the Templer<br />Knights ect.<br />Then it got &quot;silly&quot;.  One moment I thought,&quot;I've had enough<br />of the divine feminism bit&quot;, and the next moment after one more<br />&quot;escape&quot; excuse me they get out of the limo at the airport with<br />the bound albino without being seen (?)  I could see the promo<br />---and starring Harrison Ford.<br />My daughters and I had selected the book for our annual wine and<br />book discussion summer visit.

B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes are an interesting band.  Meg White may [stink] at singing, but hey, that doesn't bother me.  I think Jack is a great guitar player.  It's not how simple it is, or how difficult it is either.  It's the quality that makes this album outstanding.  I remember watching the band perform each day of one week on Conan O'Brien.  Jack can really play a mean guitar.  I know and understand much about music, and their styles are different.  This is a must own album for any rock n roll fan.  Jack and Meg's styles have made this band sound different and unique. Not any other music group can be compared to them.  <br />My favorite songs include Seven Nation Army, Ball and Biscuit, and Hypnotize.  There is a mix of slow songs, fast songs, and just plain ole rock!  Meg sings in the song, \\"In the Cold, Cold, Night\\".  It's not the best, but its fun to listen to.  The last song, \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" , is a great song that reminds me of the Mama's and the Papa's.  <br />...
078322737X|5.0|\\"American Graffiti\\" is a classic film that in some ways, can relate to another classic: \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" both were about teenagers. In \\"American Graffiti,\\" within a day, all characters mature and grow up. It is the same with Jim Stark in \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" who in the film is caught in something big that will effect his life forever (the chicky run), as that is also the case with Steve and Kurt in \\"American Graffiti\\" (should they stay home or fly off east to collage).<BR>\\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" was based on James Dean and his character from \\"East of Eden,\\" George Lucas based all of the male leads in \\"American Graffiti\\" (with the exception of Steve Bolander) on himself. Both films represent teenage nostalgia (although at the time it was made, \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" just represented teenagers) \\"American Graffiti\\" would represent the great memories you had as a teenager in the 50's and early 60's, \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" would represent what you were caught up in, and how to be a man in the 50's. Both films have dark ending which are horrificly realistic as in \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" when the Plato character runs away with an unloaded gun and is shot by the police (the same fate of Dallas Winstons charatcer in \\"The Outsiders\\") and in \\"American Graffiti\\" when it shows the epilogue of our heroes where John Milner is killed and becomes apart of the legacy of racing heroes in that junk yard that he and Carol had walked through earlyer in the film. Terry \\"The Toad\\" meets a heroes end as his final fate is being \\"Declared missing in action.\\" Steve finds out what he wants to do with his life and decides not to make it big but live a peaceful life as an insurance agent in Madesto. And Kurt makes up his mind as he becomes a writter living in Canada.<BR>There is lightness in both dark endings of the films as in \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" Jims father finally faces father hood and is there for Jim, along with in \\"American Graffiti,\\" with Steves and Kurts future.<BR>Overall, both movies were superb, realistic, memorable, and will share a long lasting place in movie history.
0783222955|5.0|I have often introduced favorite books and movies to my two daughters, hoping they would love them as I do. My \\"batting average\\" on this has been less than 1.000; however, I hit a home run with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". Both girls, ages 11 and 14, now count it among their favorite movies.<BR>It's hard to believe anyone could pan this movie; yet that's exactly what the famous movie critic Roger Ebert did. Apparently the movie was too \\"white\\" for his taste. For example, with the exception of Tom, hardly any lines of dialogue were accorded to black actors. Roger: this is a story told throught the eyes of a white Southern child; other books and movies have told stories from the black experience. Next,Ebert finds it amazing that Atticus believed that Tom was shot trying to escape. Of course, implies Roger, he was gunned down in cold blood by the guard. Earth to Roger! This is a work of fiction. Tom's fate was whatever the author said it was. Ebert even picked at Sheriff Tate's \\"let the dead bury the dead, Mr. Finch\\" near the end of the film, wondering how Tom and Ewell would feel about burying each other. Again -- Earth to Roger! Hello? Hello? Tate was quoting Scripture, something a person might well do in that circumstance, without first analyzing every deep repercussion to his words.<BR>In summary: if you're a pretentious, riddled-with-white-liberal-guilt movie critic like Ebert, feel free to write drivel like his. But if you're a normal person, this is a movie to treasure.
B000089CJI|3.0|As an avid electronic fan, many of my friends suggested I pick up this album because it 'is simply amazing!'<br />I wasn't exactly dissapointed, but I would certaintly not call this album amazing.  While the music is fun and the beats are 'jumpin', this album is just that.  Fun.  Nothing more, and there's room for discussion if it's nothing less.  The songs all sound pre-programmed and I would guess this album took a month tops to make.  <br />Any comparison to Radiohead belittles the name of Radiohead and all serious electronic acts such as the Notwist, Ars Phoenix and Fake Problems.<br />This album isn't a must have, but if you have spare time, download it.  It's fun pop music, and I hope they don't make another CD.

0553577123|5.0|I should have read this book years ago when I was in my adolescent years.  This book is phenominal in every aspect.  Anne's writings are beautiful. She wrote well beyond her 14 years of age.  She was saturated with wisdom.  This diary focuses on the beginning of their ordeal living in the attic in hiding from the Germans.  It goes into great detail about everyday life spent living with a number of individuals in a confined space under hostile circumstances.  Anne goes from child to young women in her diary.  It is a great read for every age group.  It allows you to appreciate your environment and to be thankful for what you have. .

B00005KB9W|5.0|...when it hits, you feel no pain.&quot;<br />From the opening notes of &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot; to the end of &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; (I do not have the remastered version w/ &quot;Kinky Reggae&quot;), Bob Marley and the Wailers weave a tight infectious groove that must have been amazing to witness live.  Recorded in 1975, the band is clearly &quot;into it&quot; and they deliver definitive versions of some of their best-known tunes up to that point.<br />While short by today's standards, Live! is superior to the more lengthy, but not quite as strong, Babylon by Bus.  There is not a weak track in the bunch.  &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot; is a great opener and &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; is an absolute show-stopper.<br />In short, this is a tremendous CD...&quot;so hit me with music...&quot;

B00005JLSE|5.0|Let me start off by saying, why do people complare Chicago to Moulin Rouge. People are putting Chicago down, and others are putting them both down. Why? They were both great musicals but I just don't see why people would compare them. IS it the singing? It can't be in both movies the singing was fabulous. Was it the acting? Couldn't be. The acting in Moulin Rouge was so colourful and alve. The acting in Chicago was the same, colourful and alive. So s it the music they played? I hope not. I loved Moulin Rouge's music because they took songs and made them their own. In Chicago, they used songs from the show, except the last song \\"I Move On\\" sung by Zellwigger and Zeta-Jones. So what could it be? I don't see anything the same about the two musicals. Other then the fact they are musical. I mena in Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman's voice was astounding. But who can't say Zeta-Jone's voice is bad. She was wonderful. Same will Zellwigger. And let's not forget the tap-dancing done by the wonerful Gere. And The Queen did a brilent job in her character and her song. And John C. Reilly as Amos, I can't think of anyone who would do a better job at that character then John. I was also glad to see Chita Rivera as Nikkie. Chita was n the broadway production of Chicago and it was great for her to be in the movie. I never saw her but I think it's great. I also loved how Lucy Lui was in the movie playing the rich snobby Kitty Baxter. Also Chrinstine Barinkskie and Marry Sunshine, brillient. In Moulin Rouge I also loved all the cast. I loved in Moulin Rouge How it felt like your watching a colourful pplay on your tv. Bu in Chicago I loved how every actor in the movie was their own character. It looked like they were all themselves. Like they had played this character before, know how to act, and what to say and how to say it. But in conclusion, I think Moulin Rouge and CHicago are wonderful movies. I love Chicago so much, I have even have th book, and a framed poster. But I just don't seewhy people compare the two?

The craziest imagination of the most creative mind in anime produces yet another world of fantasy and magic, with his own views on the world woven subtly in to create a great visual piece of animation, as well as a strong story. Even if you've never given anime a try this is for you. Everyone should get a chance to see this film.<br />The English sound track looks like it has been well put together, but the only way to watch any anime is in its original Japanese language format, and this one is great with a predictably solid sound track from Jo Hisaishi, and some memorable voice acting. The DVD also boasts the original trailers, storyboards, interviews with the English speaking voice actors and an interesting &quot;Making of&quot; piece (from Japanese TV with subtitles) that follows Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli team through the production of the film. <br />Whether you're young or old, into cartoons or not check this film out. No one could be disappointed.
0192833588|5.0|\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first Jane Austen novel to achieve publication. Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.<br />Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.<br />Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.<br />Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.<br />Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson.scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden was originally published in 1952, and the setting for the novel is the late 19th and early 20th century.  I still enjoyed reading East of Eden though, because there are timeless themes presented in this book.  Sibling rivalry, guilt, and betrayal are some of the main themes in this book. It was ironic and interesting to read how 2 sets of brothers from different generations compete for the approval and love of their father.<br /><br />There are many memorable characters with strong personalities in East of Eden.  I loved the complex character of Cathy.  She is a whore who shoots her husband and abandons her family.  This incident leaves her husband Adam shattered and confused in the beginning of the story.  I loved how Adam becomes a stronger person and a better father later in the book.  I loved the supporting character named  Lee in this novel.  He is a loyal servant to the patriarch Adam Trask.  He is also the primary caretaker to Adam Trask's sons Caleb and Aron.<br />  I loved reading about the development of the characters especially the twins Caleb and Aron.  Caleb is the curious, brave, independent, strong willed sibling who has dark thoughts.  His brother Aron is the sensitive, studious one.  The contrast between their personalities is very interesting.  The most intense part of the book is when Caleb learns of the existence of his mother and confronts her.<br />  East of Eden becomes a very predictable book about a third of the way in, but it is still a wonderfully written book.  I simply loved the evolution of the characters especially Adam.  East of Eden has themes of sibling rivalry,  guilt,  betrayal, loss,  and the American dream of getting ahead and raising a family that are still relevant in society today. I enjoyed it very much.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|Furtwangler's 1954 Salzburg production, now on DVD, is a wonderful historical document. Many reviewer's on this site criticise his slow tempi, but who are we  to criticise one of the greatest (if not the greatest) conductors of the 20th century? His &quot;colossal musical intellect&quot; (Opera Rough Guide)<br />applied to this work is nothing less than phenomenal. He views<br />this opera as a tragedy, rather than a comedy, and his well chosen ,but slower, speeds confirm this. He maintains the tension<br />throughout, letting the beauty of the details and inner voices  come out.<br />However he does spring to life when necessary and there is never a dull moment.In the overture, where we see him conduct, the first act finale and the finale itself you will see the master at his best!<br />The stage design and direction is<br />conventional, but this is not a modern production.<br />Cesare Siepi is definitely the best Don of his generation. He looks the part, acts with a great deal of flair and sings wonderfully.You will love the &quot;champagne aria&quot;. He is a feast for the eye and ear, a triumph. The other singers are all first class.DVD sound is excellent.<br />One negative point perhaps: The overture return is ommitted.<br /> So is Don Ottavio's first aria (&quot;Dalla sua pace&quot;), for reasons unknown. This is unfortunate.<br />But still, my advice to you is: grab it while the supplies last!
0792151712|5.0|Every one knows this is such a great movie. A++
B000063USY|2.0|Unfortunately, the idea of cool and being part of the in crowd is a big part of today's youth, and even more disappointingly, Hollywood.  Case in point... `The Fast And The Furious' starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.  Take for example my 14-year old sister.  She knows absolutely nothing about cars, whether it be parts of the engine or drag racing.  She knows none of the names of the actors in the movie.  Believe me, I've asked her.  She just thinks it's THE cool movie to watch because her friends told her it was THE cool movie to watch.  And that's exactly what America's youth wants: just to be part of something that's seen as fashionably adequate.  So in that respect, `The Fast And The Furious' is an excellent movie.  It's just too bad--no--it's inappropriate, that this movie takes such advantage of our youth's gullibility.<br />The two main characters in the movie are Brian (Walker) and Dom (Diesel).  Along with their supposed sexiness comes fast cars, fast women, and all the action you could ever want.  But what's not included in the package is a decent plot or even good acting.  But who needs those things anymore, right?  All we need now is some hot ass and a few awesomely designed, super fast cars.  The scenario is basically that Brian, an undercover cop, is to find out if Dom and his gang of punks and hot women are part of an ongoing problem involving trucks being robbed of their drag-racing car parts.  But like they do to so many kids, the bright lights and craziness of the streets sway Brian into thinking: `hey... this ain't so bad'.  Even with the storyline being weak, it does manage to promote lawbreaking and, though not directly, label it okay to the point of (once again)- cool.  It's not like in `Gone In 60 Seconds' where a helpless brother was to be saved; justifying their wrongdoings.  Here they're just stealing car parts to use in illegal street races (that are again glorified beyond belief).  Together Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are satisfactory when it comes to acting.  But apart their true talents show.  Just look at their respective, separate movies.  `XXX', a good film with a similar scheme, is much, much better than this.  And even movies like `Pitch Black' and `Knockaround Guys' portray Diesel in a manner more fitting of his genius.  Paul Walker's only other (somewhat) popular movie was `Joy Ride'.  Don't even waste your time with that one.  You can tell I am a fan of Vin Diesel--he was my reason for watching this movie in the first place--and, along with a few choice car crashes, he was probably the only brilliancy I noticed.  Why they decided to omit him from `2 Fast 2 Furious', the sequel I'm NOT going to see, is beyond me.  Come to think of it, it was probably Vin's decision to keep his name off something so silly.  Congrats, Vin, you made a wise choice.<br />This movie seems to become more and more popular as more and more people see it.  Kudos to the directors for hitting the jackpot; shame on them for rigging it so the 13- and 14-year olds who watched it had no choice but to tell their friends it was `awesome!'.  I could've easily given this movie 1 star and still feel good about it.  Instead I gave `The Fast And The Furious' 2 stars for the aforementioned two reasons.  Other than those \\"bright spots\\" the movie was unmemorable, unimaginative, and arguably one of the most misleading films of recent times.  Even if you love Vin Diesel you might be disappointed with it.  He does a good job, but he just doesn't seem to fit in with the gangster wannabes and poor actors.  Really, only his name seems appropriate (Diesel... cars... get it?).  And if you don't care much for fast cars and their flashy colors, what the heck are you doing here?  Steer clear of this one, at all costs.n it comes to acting.  But apart their true talents show.

0385504209|5.0|I was interested but extremely skeptical about the book I received for my birthday.  But after reading I will be purchasing more of Dan Brown's work.  The character's are well-developed (I easily identified with their reasoning and emotions), the plot is both complicated, but extremely simplistic in its thought.  You just get pulled deeper and deeperin this amazing story with its many twists and turns, page after page. The research (wife is art historian), insight from first hand accounts of art, architecture, history, and real societies and oganizations make this story one of the best I have read.  Read this, you won't regret it.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Wu-Tang is great, but i have never been ipressed by Redman as a solo. His rhymes seemed cheesy and the songs, although catchy, always seemed to wear on me quickly. Method Man has shined in the past in both solo (Tical) and group efforts, and Blackout is no different. <br />The chemistry between red and meth is undeniable, which is the strength of the album. Whether or not they are taking turns or alternating rhymes, it always seems to fit together.<br />There are some real bangers on this album, especially the singles 'da rockwilder' and 'tear da roof off.' however the more subtle beats and flows seen in '4 seasons' and 'cereal killer' seems to cater more toward meth's style (cereal killer is produced by RZA), and are two of my favorite tracks. a song more geared toward red's flow is 'fire in tha hole,' an uptempo track where red shines. ghostface comes on the track on 'run for cover,' a welcome cameo.<br />method man is one of my favorite emcees, and i was worried when he collaborated with red, especially rhyming over erick sermon tracks. but the truth is it worked. this isn't an introspective album by any means. it does not make you think and does not change who you are. but it doesnt say anywhere that those qualities are a prerequisite for a good album. Blackout is pure....fun for lack of a better word. you can't help but nod your head and follow along as meth and red tear through the tracks. i was doing this despite low expectations
B00005J6SZ|4.0|What more can I say? This IS Madonna's BIGGEST album, sure some beg to differ but this is the album that put Miss Maddy on the top of the totem pole. This album made her who she is today, a stunning artist that knows how to entertain and gives a message while doing it. Before Spice Girls, who were shouting out &quot;Girl Power&quot; all the way to their sucess, Madonna practically invented it. She was all woman and who cared if she got a little undressed...well some did (parents..jeez!)but Madonna still maintains to be truthful in her music. But let's get on shall we...<br />&quot;Like A Virgin&quot; is a very well..likable album. You will instantly be hooked. Some of these songs charmed their way to the top and still remain classics today.<br />Material Girl- Who doesn'tlike this song? Poppy, fun and makes ya wanta charge it! Just joking. This was Madonna's burden, sadly, she's still being call this to this very day. (9/10)<br />Angel- This is a wonderful song, especially the bass line. Very catchy and rhythmical. (10/10)<br />Like A Virgin- Who hasn't heard this song? Madonna was the only woman who had the guts to roll around in a wedding dress during the MTV Video Awards back in 1984 singing this song. Wish I was around when this happened, I wasn't even thought of yet! Still a staple Madonna song that is poppy and fun (10/10)<br />Over And Over- This song does go &quot;over and over&quot;. One song that you'll dance too and pass out from in no time. Still it has a message of dusting yourself and trying again till you get it done. One that shouldn't be missed. (7/10)<br />Love Don't Live Here Anymore- A beautiful remake. Check out the original by Rose Royce, it's just as magical as this one. Madonna doesn't have to sound like a overpowered diva to croon to this song. It's simple and raw. (10/10)<br />Dress You Up- Personally, I think this song is cute. Fun and poppy, a Madonna classic. (9/10)<br />Shoo Bee Doo- A cute song, I like the sax part, don't know what she's talking about but hey, shoo bee doo ooh la la! (7/10)<br />Pretender-Love the percussion work on this. Different from the other uptempos in being very sharp and edgy. A true gem. (10/10)<br />Stay-A verrry catchy song that will be stuck in your head for days! I swear! Has a great melody and great lyrics another true gem. (10/10)<br />Enough of small talk, buy this album. It's pure 80's pop at it's best and it's one of Madonna's classics. For some more Madonna 80's fun check out debut, True Blue, Like A Prayer &amp; Immaculate Collection (For &quot;Get Into The Groove&quot;, &quot;Vouge&quot;, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;). You will enjoy every one, trust me.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I thought Clerks was tied for the best Kevin Smith movie along with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Although all of Kevin Smith&quot;s movies were great , this one is especially! I mean Dogma was good, but  a lot of it  wasn't all that funny which would leave that at a 9.1/10. Chasing Amy was good too, but it was my least favorite Jay and Silent Bob movie because they were only in it 1 time which would leave that movie at a 8.9 or a 9.0 out of 10. As for Mallrats that to was an excellent film  , but it just wasn't as good as Clerks. the scene where Jay and Silent  Bob were running from  the LaFours was great and so was the dis on Batman, but Mallrats still wasn't as good as Clerks, I would give it a 9.5/10. As for Jay and Silent Bob Strike back that was equally as good because of the amount of other celeberties (Will Ferell,Jason Biggs,Seann William Scott,Shannon Elizabeth, ,Ben Affleck,Chris Rock and Jamie Kennedy being my personal favorites) (due to the many other good movies they have starred in) Anyway Clerks is on my top 5 best movies. I have no reai favorite, but whenever someone askes me I always start with Clerks and say a few others. This is my review on Clerks.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave hands down is now my favorite rock band.  Chris Cornell's voice is so awesome.  At times his voice can sound like a hard rocker's voice but at the same time it's soothing.  Great guitar playing and drums.  Tom Morello is awesome too.  The cd has 14 tracks and they're all good but i rated them anyways.<br />Cochise- 8/10-  Still a good track but it doesn't match up to the rest of the songs on the cd.<br />Show Me How To Live- 10/10-  One of my favorite songs right now.  Cornell's vocals in this one is perfect and the music is great to go along with it.  Awesome.<br />Gasoline- 10/10- Another perfect track...never get tired of it<br />What You Are- 10/10- Another awesome song.  I think Audioslave should release more songs.<br />Like A Stone-10/10- Their first radio single.  Great song with a good rhythm although the way Cornell sings the lyrics it can be hard to understand, but i read the lyrics and it all made sense.<br />Set It Off-10/10- My favorite song on the cd.  Great chorus and lyrics and awesome singing by Cornell.  Great guitar playing as always by Morello.<br />Shadown On The Sun- 10/10-  And another great song, the htis just keep on comin'  A good melodic tune.<br />I Am The Highway- 10/10 great song lyrically and just all together awesome.<br />Exploder-9/10- Great riffs and great lyrics but I just think it's too short.<br />Hypnotize-9/10- Another great song but again I think it's just too short.<br />Bring Em' Back Alive- 10/10- A wonderful song if you really listen to it.<br />Light My Way- 10/10- Great song with a slower rhythym to it<br />Getaway Car- 10/10- My 3rd favorite on the cd.  Very good slow song.<br />The Last Remaining Light-10/10-  Another great slow song.  Tied for my 3rd favorite.<br />All the songs are great and you will not be dissapointed.  I recommend this cd to anybody and I promise it will no be a waste of money.  I'm looking forward to seeing more from this awesome band.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This film was ranked highest when the American Film Institute announced its list of \\"America's Greatest Movies,\\" followed by Casablanca, The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia which complete the top five. It has been 62 years since its release and yet it remains one of the most interesting, indeed compelling films ever made. It was directed by Orson Welles who also plays the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. William Randolph Hearst presumably served as the model for Kane. (I have no interest in getting into all that now. Others have already discussed quite thoroughly the film's historical context and have much of value to say about it. The comments which follow are limited entirely to the film itself.) Perhaps only directors and cinematographers can fully appreciate Welles' technical achievements in this film. Even 62 years later, I am still fascinated by the analysis of Kane personality, especially as it is revealed in his relationships with various associates over several decades. His intelligence is formidable, his charm almost irresistible and yet....<br /><br />Most of us have an indelible childhood memory or association. For Kane, it is \\"Rosebud,\\" the last word he spoke before dying. Those who view this film accompany reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he seeks to understand the meaning of Kane's last word. We learn that  Kane  was relinquished as a child by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a substantial fortune; his conflicts with his guardian, Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impetuous decision to run a newspaper with the help of schoolmate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) because it would be \\"fun\\"; his emergence from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; then Kane's bid for public office which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's futile attempts to promote his second wife as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive but incomplete palace called \\"Xanadu.\\"<br /><br />Thompson conscientiously attempts to reconstruct Kane's life as best he can but even so, there are so many unanswered questions as the film ends. What does Kane make of his childhood? When was he happiest? Why embarrass and abandon Emily, a decent and devoted wife? Why did he decide to spend what remained of his life with Susan Alexander? As he lay dying, did he feel that his life (everything considered) was a success? I have thought about these and other questions a great deal and am dissatisfied with my responses to them. No doubt that explains why this film continues to attract and then frustrate me...and perhaps others. There are other questions which I would have asked of Welles, especially during his final years.<br /><br />Perhaps (just perhaps) the answers to all of the questions which could be asked of Kane and of the man who created and then portrayed him cannot be answered. And perhaps (just perhaps) that is why this film continues to attract and then frustrate efforts such as mine and others to explain it. So I guess we must cherish its art and accept its ambiguities, just as ultimately we must accept the basic ambiguity of what it means to be a complicated human being.ane's bid for public office which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's futile attempts to promote his second wife as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive but incomplete palace called \\"Xanadu.\\"    Thompson conscientiously attempts to reconstruct Kane's life as best he can but even so, there are so many unanswered questions as the film ends.

B00004VVNE|5.0|Those who pass this film off as a relic of a bygone cold war period do not recognize the relevancy to today's military madness. There is of course the matter of nuclear missles currently held by Russia and their breakaway Republics which are have deteriorating security systems. But I don't want to get into tecnicalities here. What is most relevant is the argument made by the professor (Walter Matthau) who advises the military leaders. It is exactly what we are hearing today by our government...&quot;We gotta get them before they get us!&quot; He advises the military to not recall the errant bombers, but to let them destroy Russia because he believes the Communists want world domination and its either them or us who must ultimately perish in the conflict. He wants to take advantage of the situation as an unprovoked pre-emtive strike. Sound hauntingly familiar?
B00009W0WM|5.0|Only Citizen Kane was ranked higher when the American Film Institute announced its list of \\"America's Greatest Movies.\\" (The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia complete the top five.) My own opinion is that AFI ranked Casablanca higher than it deserves. Nonetheless, the film remains immensely popular among critics and film historians as well as so-called movie buffs. It received an Academy Award as best film in 1943, as did Michael Curtiz for directing it. Bogart and Bergman are joined by an especially strong supporting cast (notably Greenstreet, Henreid, Lorre, Rains, and Veidt). There really isn't much to the plot but the dialogue is first-rate. (Philip Epstein, Julius Epstein, and Howard W. Koch shared an Oscar for best screenplay.) It is tempting to over-analyze this film by, for example, devoting excessive attention to American versus European sensibilities during World War II, the conflict between what Rick and Ilsa want to do with what they think they ought to do, etc.<br />Obviously, the war in progress outside of Rick's cafe cannot be denied although he makes every effort to insulate himself and his clientele from it. There is no shortage of social and political issues and yet, in my opinion, the significance of the film -- and its enduring appeal -- is explained by the development of the relationship between Rick and Ilsa. The final resolution is necessarily somewhat ambiguous, I think, precisely because the relationship between two people in war time faces quite different challenges, obligations, and implications than it would otherwise. Ultimately, having recently seen this film again in a special edition, accompanied by an abundance of supplementary features (e.g.  Roger Ebert's commentary, Lauren Bacall's Introduction, and about ten minutes of additional scenes and out takes), I think the film now has a special symbolic significance which could not have been evident when it was released in 1942. More specifically, it somehow dramatizes what so many of us also struggle with when seeking a balance of obligations to ourselves and to others as well as to certain values which sustain the human race, especially during crises which threaten its survival. Perhaps I make too much of this film but these are among the reasons why it continues to hold special meaning for me.zes what so many of us also struggle with when seeking a balance of obligations to ourselves and to others as well as to certain values which sustain the human race, especially during crises which threaten its survival.

0385504209|4.0|This is a fun read with lots of puzzles, ciphers and references to art history, and I completely recommend it. My copy is making its way through my office. The only place where this book goes astray is when it tries to come up with a good conspiracy theory.  Suppression of the mother cult started long before Constantine (a good starting point is \\"When God was a Woman\\" by Stone).  Constantine also probably got a good dose of Christianity from his mother, St. Helen. The Knights Templar were a threat to the consolidation of power of Philip IV of France not pope Clement V or the Catholic Church. In fact there was a power struggle between the two and Philip decided the \\"Bishop of Rome\\" would be better quartered in Avigon France, under \\"French protection\\".  In fact the knights were tried in French courts, for religious crimes by an inquisitor who was excommunicated!  Something the pope objected to but Philip ignored.  Good sources are \\"The Templars\\" by  Read and \\"The Knights Templar: A New History\\" by Nicholson.  In \\"The Templars and the Grail\\" Ralls points out that the trials were politically motivated and pretty much a kangaroo court.  Whenever the Templars were brought before the inquisitors they were acquitted except when brutally tortured.  Which meant everywhere in Europe except France and Naples (Charles II of Naples was Philip's uncle..go figure).  The outcome is the Templars were only guilty of supporting the church, defending pilgrams, being prosperous and being in Philips way. In an unusual act of defiance Clement transferred the Templar's holdings to the other religious orders primarily the Order of St. John (Knights Hospitallers) keeping them out of Philips hands. A lot of the myths and legends used in the book belong in the \\"El Dorado\\" category but it lends an air of mystery to the work.  The work has a lot of the spirit of Umberto Eco but without the tedium and academic rigor and is a great summer read.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I had only heard of the Sigur Ros before the Untitled album had been release, never really bothered to take a listen. About a month ago I was tipped off about them and that night I went to their site and listened/watched the video mixer. It was the first song on the Untitled album, and when it was over I could only sit there and cry. <BR>   The next day I went to the nearest music store, listened to the 30 second demos of two of the songs and immediatly purchased their new album, no doubt at all. <BR>   It is the most inspirational masterpiece of music I possess; haunting, melodic, in surrealistic drift of a dream, it is a superb accomplishment. I know I'm greatful for it, as it has inspired much of my art and poetry.<BR>   The album ( ) is for anyone willing to open up their mind, perhaps sit for the record's length outside with something that doesn't require much thought to lead you away from the music. You will find that seeing through Sigur Ros' music is an entirely different experience from anything else you are used to.
B000092Q7O|5.0|Masterpiece tells of Warsaw Jewish pianist who must hide from the Nazis during the invasion of Poland. Incredible writing, first-rate acting, and utterly compelling direction breathe life into this moving, intensely personal, exciting, and important film. Beginning filmmakers should study this film long and hard to see how to create artful storytelling and overall subtlety. Brody is superb, but the entire production is magical. Ironically, I first watched this after I finished Mel Brooks' THE PRODUCERS. Rated R for wartime violence (but it is remarkably restrained).
B00000IMCW|5.0|Although many parts of it are dated and almost laughable by today's standards, George Romero's zombie epic is unmatched by any made before or after it, including Romero's own Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead. This is the Empire Strikes Back of horror films.<br />Picking up a little bit after Night of the Living Dead left off, the dead are rising and crave living human flesh for food. Two SWAT team officers and two TV station employees steal a traffic helicopter and flee the carnage, eventually taking refuge in a massive mall which is filled to the brim with zombies yet offers great potential as a shelter.<br />Although ultimately a horror film, Dawn serves equally well as an action piece. The survivors don't only fight the zombies but other survivors, making for some explosively gory shootouts. The film conveys a good message about consumerism too; as the zombies mindlessly drone about the mall that they remember from their past lives, it's almost the same as watching living people.<br />It may be a tad bit dated, but Dawn of the Dead holds up as a great horror and action movie, and even as a satire on human nature and consumerism. Throw some truly horrific comic book gore into the mix and you've got one hell of a great movie for anyone with a strong stomach.
B000000OU6|5.0|I believe the choice of that vocalist, was by all means a wise choice, come on we have too many droning Kurt Cobain/Eddie Vedder copies and clones. Screaming vocals is what rock and roll was all about, and Slash if we all remember comes from a band that made their mark with the trademark screams of Axl Rose, why not give the fans what they want, more Guns N' Roses style music, which is exactly what he's done on this album. So you can't slate this album for vocals, or guitar playing or any musical aspect, you're obviously not paying attention, in this modern music world, this is a rock masterpiece!
B00005JM1F|1.0|i dont get these teen movies anymore  theyre vulgar and naugty. Kids want to see them because they want to see some sex but thaats beond the point. The point is that these movies like Old School go overboard. The olny teen movie I enjoyed was American Pie. It was vulgar but not as vulgar as Old School. In Old School theres this Old man who's in a tub with naked woman and hes telling them to stroke his lobes how is that funny. I think its iommature and gross
B00000JLWW|5.0|AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING SPECTACULAR ASTOUNDING UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL film. i cannot praise it enough. Sure, the beginning is very slow and boring, but the rest of the movie is pure genius and entertainment.<br />I can't express how well Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet act in this film. Winslet got nominated for best actress, but EVILLY<BR>did not win. As for DiCaprio; well, I used to hate him. Now I think he's amazing!! Gloria Stuart is also very well cast in her role as Rose Dawson Calvert.<br />A beautiful score makes this movie even better. The Oscar-winning song \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" (sung by Celine Dion) can move some to tears. The movie itself sure made ME cry!! the ending is so moving and sad, I can't say in words how sad I felt.<br />The special effects are baffling!!!! I can't believe how incredible they are!! <br />I have to say once more how brilliant DiCaprio and Winslet are in this film--they should make more movies together!!<br />anyone who does not like this movie needs a life. They must die. I'll stalk you at night! I WILL STUFF A DRUMSTICK UP YOUR NOSE!!!!..........but really, you should see it..........
B000031WD8|4.0|You nmay think this is weird but me and my son went to go see this movie and we liked it eventhough few of parrts werent appropriate fro my son (he's14) we still enjoyed it because it was funny. I thought I was going to hate it like I hated Old School and Not Another Teen Movie but I didnt. THIS IS THE NUMBER 1 AND ORIGINAL TEEN MOVIE, If youre child unsterstands whats happening in the movie everything is ok.
6305263248|5.0|One of the best movies I own and I watch it once or twice a year, great car chases.
B0000399WI|5.0|I remember when this movie came out. I was sitting in my dorm room watching TV when the trailor came on and I thought there is no way I would ever watch it. A story about men in prison with no action, no love...what does that leave?? Well, months later I was talking to a friend and he mentioned how amazing it was. I didn't know what to say but since I needed something to watch asked if I could borrow it. I sat down with my parents, telling them I didn't really have an interest in it, but that we should give it a go because of my friend's recommendation.<br />After watching it I can say that it had more than I could have imagined; story (far better than the book), emotion (hard to put into words) and the simple notion of hope. I rate it as the best movie I have ever seen. I recommend it to everyone I come across and to this day not one person has said they were disappointed with it. Everyone should watch this movie at least once...although I guarantee if you watch it a second time that you'll see and feel things that you missed the first time.<br />Enjoy...
B00009V7T2|5.0|The long awaited album of The Mars Volta is finally here. I'm listening to it as I type. I loved ATDI, there was no way I couldn't, Cedric's voice always amazed me.On this album I was amazed because Cedric's voice is different, but the same, you get me? The lyrics always got me, always so heart felt so beautiful, so brilliant, they showed they were smart, and they had guts. On this album Omar wrote all the songs 'cept a couple which he wrote with Cedric, and I gotta say, the man can write! If you thought ATDI was brillant with their in your face lyrics, listen to DITC (Deloused in the Comatorium) Its melody, vocals and words make for a ride that you've never been on before in a tribute to Julio Venegas. If you remember ATDI's Embroglio, that was to Julio Venegas. I am also a fan of Sparta the other band that arised from the ashed of ATDI. While they rock it out, I'd have to say that DITC is just a bit better than Wiretap Scars. Cedric definitely sings more on this album and doesn't shout too much, but the emotion behind each word is felt and as it says in 'Napoleon Solo': \\"We were struck by the chords  set from their hearts  this is forever\\" this struck chords in my heart and this album will live forever. I definitly recommend fans of ATDI and Sparta buy this. Its totally different and you know it at first hear. Don't listen when people say its the same as ATDI, cause its not, its very different, in a totally different direction. Sparta is more like ATDI than The Mars Volta, but they both work it and thats all that matters. The Mars Volta does not fall short of Sparta. Nothing can compare to good music, and this IS good music.
0871137380|1.0|A client gave me this book to read and I was, therefore, obliged to finish it.  It was not easy.  I am just amazed how many 5-star reviews this book received.  Has anyone read any other military books?  Because, I've got to tell you, this is just not that good.  In fact, its not very good at all.  It is just one of those gung-ho, America the greatest books.<br />First of all, it was boring--as in hard not to fall asleep while reading it.  I like a book to build, become intensely gripping and fall off gently.  This book, unfortunately, goes right into nausiating detail on the layout of the streets and courtyard where the battle took place, but one can hardly understand it without a drawing it would seem.  Talk about filling up pages of a book.  If you take out these lengthy, unnecessary descriptions, the book would be a third lighter, at least.<br />Secondly, it is one-sided.  It never explains why the Somolians hate the US Military, which I was curious over.  I had thought I had read somewhere that the US had commited some sort of atrocity prior to the incident, which angered the Somolians but, again, no mention of it.  The book seems to be trying to convey an impression that these third world countries just hate the US for no good reason.  It tries to give some perspective from the viewpoint of the Somolians but I don't think more than a half dozen pages were devoted to this out of over 300 pages.<br />Even the writing style is weak.  Sentences are too long and often written in the passive style.  Here and there, parts are repeated.  I hate that.<br />I guess I was expecting too much.  I was looking for something to open my eyes or give me a new insight.  All this book did was make me tired.  The main thing I learned about modern warfare is that when something called an RPG hits something, which happens over and over again in this book, its pretty bad.  I only found out what an RPG is when I read it in someone else's review.  It may have been on one of the pages when my eyes were beginning to close.  There was also a description of a type of gun they were using, which just shoots a hole through someone without necessarily dropping them, whereas, it would have been better to use the type of gun that drops a man on one round. I've heard that description every time someone argues the merits of a shotgun for self defense--as if its a good thing to take a chunk out of a man's back when the bullet leaves.  This ideais oft repeated but is really getting stale.  Yet, here it is, in Black Hawk Down.<br />I borrowed the movie to see if it is any better than the book.  It couldn't be much worse.  Or could it.<br />Hey, I'm as patriotic as the next guy but I know a poorly written book when I read one.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce, Ashanti, Monica, Mya, etc - at least one of these young female singers isn't going to sell the amount of records they planned. The jury is still out on who will suffer the most with all the competition, but one thing is for sure, Ms. Knowles who is becoming somewhat of a one woman entertainment sensation, will be the least likely victim. Beyonce's solo debut Dangerously in Love has been highly anticipated, maybe even with a little apprehension after the less than stellar debut of fellow Destiny's Child band mate Kelly Rowland. To Beyonce's credit Dangerously in Love is not the album I expected from her. Though not always original, Dangerously in Love does take some chances musically, especially when it would have probably been easier for her to do a predictable and formulaic album and sell 2 million plus copies on her name alone - today's music listeners, especially the teenage ones don't ask for much. The album starts strong and has a number extremely radio friendly, possible nightclub, successes, such as \\"Baby Boy\\" featuring the now ubiquitous Sean Paul, \\"Naughty Girl\\", and \\"Hip Hop Star\\" (featuring Big Boi of Outkast and Sleepy Brown), although it really lulls somewhere past the middle towards the end. \\"Signs\\" is another slick and different track that sounds like it just missed being on Tweet's Southern Hummingbird debut album. Where this album really wins is in the \\"girl talk\\" department. Songs like \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" and \\"Yes\\" are particularly strong and appeal to very real and easy to relate to themes for young women. Even some guys should be able to relate and understand where Beyonce is coming from on those songs - well maybe not if you're the kind of guy she is talking about on \\"Yes\\". After \\"Signs\\" which is about the 8th song listeners could probably safely skip to the last song, which is (apparently a bonus cut) a solid tribute song to her father who has had a heavy influence over Beyonce's career. Overall Dangerously in Love is a solid Debut from Beyonce and better than I expected, or maybe I just set the bar too low.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Stephen King's It is my favorite novel of all time, and even though this miniseries adaptation of the book is done about as well as it could possibly be done, I can only give it four stars.  There are several reasons for this, the two most important being time and money.  The novel is an immense work, and no adaptation of three hours can even hope to do it true justice; even ten hours would not suffice for getting at the essence of the story, that essence being not horror at all but childhood.  The movie only allows the viewer to take in everything from outside, whereas the painstaking detail, insight, and atmosphere of King's novel make the reader an active participant in events.  Thus, a lot of things presented in the movie do not come off overwhelmingly convincingly, and there are more than a few noticeably sudden and seemingly unexplainable transitions even within single scenes alone.  The money issue is most evident at the end, as the special effects for the big finale were not very impressive even at the time of the movie's completion.  Special effects are not all-powerful, of course, but the B movie-ish visuals unveiled in the movie's climactic moments serve to break the spell of the viewer's suspended disbelief and introduce a touch of camp into a movie that should not really be about the big bad monster in the first place.<br />The setting for this story is a familiar one to King fans, the disquietingly different town of Derry, Maine.  Something lives underneath the town, a malevolent force that adults cannot and will not believe in, but which seven outcast kids recognize, fear, and steel themselves to conquer back in 1960.  Thirty years later, the monster they hoped they had killed as children returns, and the one character who never left Derry realizes this and calls everyone back to fulfill the promise they all made to return and kill the thing if it ever came back.  The movie is, in a sense, two movies in one, as the action shifts between the parallel actions of the characters as children and as adults.  The main character, Bill Denbrough, is played by Richard Thomas, a casting decision I did not understand at the time and still fail to comprehend completely.  Thomas does a good job, but he is still Johnboy Walton to me, and I just have trouble believing a pony-tailed Johnboy is Bill Denbrough.  Harry Anderson and John Ritter are two additional big names lending their talent to the film, but the best adult performance is turned in by Annette O'Toole as Beverly Marsh, the group's sole female member.  As I have said, though, this story is really about childhood, and the child actors are the true stars.  Jonathan Brandis is young Bill Denbrough (and like his adult counterpart, just doesn't quite fit the bill as far as I'm concerned), Seth Green succeeds much more ably in the role of Richie Tozier than his adult counterpart, Brandon Crane (whom Wonder Years fans will immediately recognize as good old Doug Porter) turns in a winning performance, and Emily Perkins shines as young Bev Marsh.  Tim Curry, it must be emphasized, was born to play Pennywise the Clown.<br />The monster in It is a conglomeration of everything each individual is afraid of; he is in a very real sense the ultimate monster because he is everything you were ever afraid of.  The seven childhood friends who comprise The Losers' Club represent a cross-section of children everywhere: one stutters, one is a hypochondriac with an overprotective mother, one is the victim of child abuse, one uses comedy to hide his fears and to win acceptance, one is overweight, one is a paragon of logic and duty, and one is a black boy in a white community; all of them are outsiders and are tormented by a bully who ably represents all bullies everywhere.  Sadly, the movie does not make it possible for the viewer to really get to know these kids and to relive his/her own childhood alongside them.  A big problem with the adult actors is the fact that they oftentimes seem tobe over-acting; I understand why this almost has to be so, however.  It is merely a sign of the intense emotions they must try to convey in a very limited amount of time and space.<br />It remains one of King's better film adaptations, despite the problems inherent in its production.  No movie can capture the magic of the novel, however.  The only unfortunate thing about the movie is the fact that it comes off as primarily a horror movie.  Certainly, there is great horror lurking in this film as it progresses, but that is not the original story's essence and primarily for this reason the movie falls short of rating five stars in my opinion.be over-acting; I understand why this almost has to be so, however.

B000069HK2|5.0|One day i was getting a ride home from school (since i am poor and dont have a car) and i heard this song on the radio. It was different than anything i have ever heard. i did not know who sang this song or the title of the song. I went home and logged on to the radio station's website and downloaded every song from their playlist and towards the end (about 100 songs) i finally found it. It was The Used \\"Taste of Ink\\". i asked for this cd for christmas and got it. the first time i heard i was like dude this guy screams a lot. Then i started to really listen to it. I quickly became one of my favorite cd's. It is the most original sounding band that i have ever heard, it is truly addictive( i could not stop listening to it). <BR>P.S. The idea that Bert dating Kelly was the only reason the band became known really sucks b/c kelly should be famous for dating bert.
0517123207|5.0|There is only one other book that is so widely known, discussed, and debated, yet so rarely read: that other book is the Bible. To make my point, here is a little quiz:<br />  1) Which name is most closely associated with the theory of evolution?<br />  2) Which book did this person write on evolution?<br />  3) What claims are made in that book?<br />  4) What else is contained in that book?<BR>    <BR>With astonishing regularity, the average literate adult will respond as follows: 1) Darwin, 2) Origin of Species, 3) Humans descended from apes, and 4) I have no idea. The first two are correct, the third is absolutely false, and the fourth is an admission of complete ignorance.  Considering that &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is over 600 pages long, and took nearly two decades to write, one would expect it to contain something more than the four simple words &quot;Humans descended from apes,&quot; which, in fact, it neither contains nor implies.  So, what DOES it contain?  There is one word that best summarizes the bulk of Darwin's magnum opus: &quot;observation&quot;.<br />It is a lengthy book; at times it is tedious, at times politically incorrect, and at times scientifically off-base.  But, despite its numerous flaws, it is one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind.  Even if you are among the few who refuse to accept Darwin's ideas, you cannot deny their impact.  The theory is the cornerstone--if not the very foundation--of modern biology.  Whatever your preconceptions, you will likely be surprised by this work.  Darwin was the consummate naturalist and scientist, as well as a refined and articulate gentleman. &quot;Origin&quot; is a delight and an epiphany to read.  It's amazing how much Darwin got right, despite the fact that he had essentially no idea of how inheritance worked.  It's amazing how much data Darwin carefully assembled, analyzed, and described.  It's amazing how meticulously Darwin weighed the evidence, noting when competing theories made different predictions, when the available evidence was not what he would have expected, and what future evidence could completely discredit (falsify) his theory.  It's amazing in its honesty.<br />The misconceptions about &quot;Origin of Species&quot; are not merely rampant, they are effectively universal, fueled (largely in the US) by the rise of creationism, which seeks first and foremost to vilify the theory of evolution as well as Darwin (often failing to distinguish between the two).  It's worth the time to read this enormous but meticulously crafted volume, if only to allow you to form your own opinions about such an influential book.  Once you have, take the little quiz again.  You may need 600 pages to answer the last question.
B00000K3UU|4.0|Despite of all negative reviews below or above, I still find this movie warm and so much watchable.  It is not all gag and fun such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison.  This movie has a real story and quite nice in fact you'll end up appreciating your time spent with your old man.  This is definitely one of Sandler's best.
B000068IEU|5.0|The film is loosely based on Inger Bergman's 1960 film The Virgin Spring. It was also Wes Craven's first feature film. It is about two girls called Mari & Phyllis who on their way to a rock concert, are kidnapped by four recently escaped criminals.  They are then raped, humiliated, tortured, mutilated, disembowelled and shot by their captors.  The criminals then spend the night in the last house on the left which is coincidently, owned by one of the girls' parents.  The parents slowly come to realise the fate of their missing daughter and the identity of their guests and proceed to exact bloody revenge on them.<br />In Britain the Last House on the Left has been causing controversy since the day it was first submitted to the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) in 1972 - it was given an outright ban with the BBFC making clear that cuts would make no difference. The film was not allowed to be screened in Britain, and among others Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The film however did manage to become available on video in the early 80s but this was before the Video Recordings Act in 1984 and it did feature predominantly on the Director of Public Prosecutions top 60 `Video Nasty' list. The film also managed to achieve 113 convictions under the Obscene Publication Act in the UK between 1983 and 1987.<br />Recently the film was submitted again to the BBFC but they demanded that cuts were required to several horrific scenes, including the woman's chest being carved with a knife, the violent stabbing assault on a woman, the removal of the woman's entrails and the humiliation of a woman forced to urinate and the two women being forced to strip naked. The film is definatley not for the faint hearted. <br />The trailer for the film invites the viewer to relish the words \\"It's only a movie, it's only a movie...\\". The film has a deep and disturbing portrayal of female humiliation that is brought upon them by their captors. Although the acting is poor and the script badthe grittyness of the film stock and the manner in which it is put to screen add to the overall effect of a dangerous movie. It does not live up to todays standards but then neither does The Exorcist, but then no true film fan would deny that that is a great film. <br />This is a must watch for all Horror fans!
B00000F5KH|5.0|This is like the only third foreign movie I've seen and from then on, I became a foreign film addict.  Movies this good should be released not only in its home country but everywhere in the world.  I've been reading the reviews of a lot of people for this movie and I find mixed reactions but generally, everyone loved the great performances, wonderful story, perfect setting and the mood it created to achieve that melodramatic audience appeal.<br />     It is a very simple yet very touching movie.  It will definitely touch that soft spot in your heart.  I am proud to have a Central Station DVD on my collection.  This is definitely one of the best and very much recommended film.
B000002U94|5.0|I grew up thinking Bob Seger was too pop and mainstream for me.  Early Scorpions, AC/DC, UFO was the prefered style.  Look who grew up?  These are great versions that go over well on a river, lake or party.  Everyone knows the words and you don't have the &quot;tired, canned&quot; versions (if they can be even called that).  30's, 40's and 50's will love this album, the quality of the recording is &quot;studio like&quot; with all the excitement of the live concert.  A must to keep the party rocking!!

0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane has written an outstanding page-turner, one that leaves you dazed and in awe at its unexpected climax.  The plot has been examined in other reviews, so I'll stick with what really makes this one such a tour de force.<br />First of all, the characterization of Teddy Daniels is incredible.  Haunted by the untimely death of his wife, his own self-destruction seems imminent and his quest for revenge unquenchable.<br />But ponder on the intense atmosphere Lehane creates, especially during the catastrophic hurricane that sweeps the island; the lost soulds of the inmates; the disturbing dreams haunting Teddy; the mysterious disappearance of his only ally; the appearance of a female in a cave.  Lehane establishes quite an aura of suspense, wonder, and mystery.  Go back and read the prologue and see if you can find anything in there to prepare you for the jawdropping climax; read the last chapter again to see if you can determine what happens; think about the white material with the gleam of metal.<br />This is a thinking man's thriller; but it is full of incredibly suspenseful scenarios.<br />Undoubtedly, Dennis Lehane is at the top of his craft, and we readers are to be thankful for such an original voice in the world of whodunits!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0385509456|5.0|My cousin's son is autistic, but that's not why I bought this book.  Admittedly, that influenced my decision, but it was the Fresh Air (NPR) interview of Mark Haddon that really made me want to buy this book.  His exuberant, intelligent comments about his life and his first adult novel were wonderful.<br />&quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; is the first novel I've read in several years.  Even so, I finished it in less than a day.  It was a book I simply could not put down.  From the first moment when we learn that Christopher is in search of Wellington's killer, to the twists and turns as the plot progresses, we know we're in for a wonderful ride.<br />I mentioned that my cousin's son is autistic.  All of the autism references in the book were definitely true to life, insofar as my experiences with my cousin have shown.  The way Haddon shows us the life of Christopher and all of his myriad emotions truly envelops us, the readers.<br />It's a fantastic book.  Truly an exquisite novel!
B00005JKN9|5.0|If you put titanic in a pot with rambo and baked for 2 hours and 40 minutes, you would get Gangs of New York.This is movie is Exellent.

This movie has a wonderfull plot, filled with action packed adventure with an amazing ending in which..., well, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

B00008PC2O|5.0|One of the classics of our time T2 took us to a new level in film making.  The incorporation of CGI to create the t1000 broke new ground. Arnold also reached his high at this point. A new standard was set for movie makers.  All the great special effects such as the Lord of the Rings exist because James Cameron took the chance which he has done many times. <BR>This DVD is almost perfect.  The picture is flawless and a THX soundtrack that sang from my sound system.  The new digital transfer was bright and crisp.  I was using an audioquest YIQ-2 which brought all the details to life. I am so glad that the industry is taking the time to redo movies that mean so much to film lovers. The second DVD is loaded with hours of special features, hours of insight on the how and why of the T2 consumed my nights for several days.  Artisan Entertainment has my applause on their release of T2 DVD. Lastly the case is interesting but I had problems with is cutting the edge of the plastic of the DVD. Extreme T2 DVD is highly recommended.  A buyer will not be disappointed.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Gangs of New York is the latest epic by famed director Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino).  Gangs of New York stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz,  John C Reilly, and Jim Broadbent.  Liam Neeson has a supporting role early in the film.  Gangs of New York was nominated for 10 Academy Awards.  This has been described as one of the best films of the year and that it should rank as one of the best of Scorsese's career.  I'm not sure about that.  I think that Gangs of New York was a good movie, but not a great one.<br />The film opens in New York City in 1846 with the stirrings of a gang war.  Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is leading his Dead Rabbits gang against Bill \\"the Butcher\\" (Daniel Day-Lewis) Cutting and his gang of \\"Natives\\".  We see the preparations for the battle that is to come as young Amsterdam Vallon follows his father around the headquarters.  The scenes we see now will serve as flashbacks later as Amsterdam remembers the past.  For now all this leads up to a major battle out in the streets between the two gangs and this ends with Bill the Butcher killing Priest Vallon in the streets as Amsterdam looks on.  The Dead Rabbits are disbanded and outlawed, and Amsterdam is sent away to a religious boarding school to be educated.<br />Flash forward 17 years to 1863.  The United States is in the midst of the Civil War.  Irish immigrants are nearly flowing off the boats and are being pressed directly into military service for the Union.  During the course of the movie we will see the infamous draft riots when the Federal Government institutes the first military draft in American history.  To add to the reason for the draft, a man could be excused from the draft by paying $300 or offering a substitute.  No poor man could do this and there was resentment, then anger, then riots.  It is to this atmosphere that Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returned to the Five Corners neighborhood of New York City.<br />Amsterdam has returned to New York and learns about the aftermath of his father's death.  Bill the Butcher has pretty much taken control and while he is a feared gang leader he also appears to be a civic leader in the society.  Amsterdam feeds a slow burning hate.  He wants to get close to Bill to be able to kill him in front of the whole world (rather than in private).  Bill takes Amsterdam under his wing as an apprentice and a fighter in his gang.  Amsterdam also meets a pick pocket (and Bill's former mistress), a woman named Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz).  The focus of the film is the development of Amsterdam's character and his relationship with Bill.  For the most part, Jenny is left as mostly as supporting role with little to do in regards to the story.  There is minor focus on a relationship between Amsterdam and Jenny, but it is clear that this is not nearly as important as anything featuring Bill the Butcher.  In fact, Bill the Butcher steals every scene that he is in.  When Bill is in the movie you just can't take your eyes off of him.<br />I mentioned earlier that this is a good movie, but not a great one.  I don't quite know why Gangs of New York fails to be an outstanding movie.  Despite the fact that it is very interesting, fairly fast paced, has incredibly images and design, a fantastic director, excellent acting, has Daniel Day-Lewis; the parts are somewhat greater than the whole.  That's the thing, the movie has everything it needs to be great but it falls short on some emotional level and is merely very good.  I recommend this movie as one of the better films of 2002 and worth watching.  Gangs of New York just may not take a place as one of the best films of all time...a potential that it did not quite live up to.erdam has returned to New York and learns about the aftermath of his father's death.  Bill the Butcher has pretty much taken control and while he is a feared gang leader he also appears to be a civic leader in the society.  Amsterdam feeds a slow burning hate.  He wants to get close to Bill to be able to kill him in front of the whole world (rather than in private).  Bill takes Amsterdam under his wing as an apprentice and a fighter in his gang.  Amsterdam also meets a pick pocket (and Bill's former mistress), a woman named Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz).  The focus of the film is the development of Amsterdam's character and his relationship with Bill.  For the most part, Jenny is left as mostly as supporting role with little to do in regards to the story.  There is minor focus on a relationship between Amsterdam and Jenny, but it is clear that this is not nearly as important as anything featuring Bill the Butcher.  In fact, Bill the Butcher steals every scene that he is in.  When Bill is in the movie you just can't take your eyes off of him.  <br />I mentioned earlier that this is a good movie, but not a great one.  I don't quite know why Gangs of New York fails to be an outstanding movie.  Despite the fact that it is very interesting, fairly fast paced, has incredibly images and design, a fantastic director, excellent acting, has Daniel Day-Lewis; the parts are somewhat greater than the whole.  That's the thing, the movie has everything it needs to be great but it falls short on some emotional level and is merely very good.  I recommend this movie as one of the better films of 2002 and worth watching.  Gangs of New York just may not take a place as one of the best films of all time...a potential that it did not quite live up to.

1563898586|3.0|With the movie adaptation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen coming out I figured now was a good time to become familiar with the source material and to get an understanding of who these characters are and how the whole comic works.  The comic/graphic novel (depends what you want to call it) is set in 1898,England.<br />Mina Murray (Bram Stoker's Dracula) is putting together a team made up of 19th Century literary heroes.  The team will comprise Alan Quartermain (King Solomon's Mines), The Invisible Man (title character), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (title character), Captain Nemo (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea).  Other literary characters make appearances (the brother of Sherlock Holmes and somebody who may be a grandfather of James Bond...).  The goal of this team is to save London from all threats.<br />This first volume contains the first six issues of the graphic novel and is one complete story with a beginning, middle, and end.  It features the gathering of the League and the first enemy who is trying to destroy London.  The artwork is stunning and the book is well done.  This is a well told story, but my main problem was simply that I knew of the characters mostly by name and some by reputation.  The only characters that I was truly familiar with were the Invisible Man and Jekyll/Hyde.  This removed some of the charm of the book because it was not a romp with familiar characters but rather with familiar names.  I'll give this a positive review, but this isn't exactly my taste.
6305127697|4.0|PRIMAL FEAR is an entertaining thriller with some plot twists, good performances and interesting story. But the best part of the movie is the Edward Norton performance, he steals the show from good actors every time he appears on the screen.<br />The movie introduces a cynical, narcissist and ambitious famous lawyer Martin Vail, he is played by Richard Gere, and of course he has no problem with the role because Richard Gere is cynical, narcissist, ambitious and famous. Anyway, when Martin Vail watches on TV the arrest of a boy accused of the homicide of a Chicago archbishop, he immediately sees the opportunity of raise his profile by defending the boy.<br />Then he meets Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a quiet and harmless boy; then the lawyer realizes that Aaron is innocent. After that, the movie becomes an entertaining thriller / mystery / courtroom drama, with some plot twists, interesting characters and revelations.<br />But the most interesting part is to see all the changes and emotions that Edward Norton prints in his character, he is just an amazing actor, his performance is by far the best in the movie. After this film, Norton delivered his best performance in AMERICAN HISTORY X, and established himself as the best actor of his generation.
0385507755|2.0|I had a hard time with this book.  He goes to rehab and falls in love with a crack-addicted hooker with a heart of gold, and becomes like a son to a well-known and very connected mobster?  Who then asks him to be his son?  Are you sure this wasn't an episode of \\"Touched By An Angel\\"?<BR>The writing style is really annoying.  I tried to like it, and attempted to think from his point of view, but the author is so pompous.  And listening to him repeatedly try to convince himself he was a badass quickly became old.  <BR>From previous reviews I've read, some people obviously love this book.  I don't get it.
B000099T2L|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I popped 'Dangerously in Love' into my CD player.  I was expecting a lot of upbeat dance tunes, but what I got was a very mature, very sensual album.  I'll give you a song-by-song review:<BR>1) 'Crazy in Love' is a catchy, upbeat dance song.  It gets repetitive, though.  4/5<BR>2) 'Naughty Girl' is a good dance song, but it gets boring after a few listens.  3/5<BR>3) 'Baby Boy' is yet another good dance song.  It was hard for me to get in to at first, but it grew on me after a few listens.  Some corny lyrics, though (&quot;The music is the sun/the dance floor becomes the sea&quot;).<BR>4) One of my favorites on the album, 'Hip Hop Star' is a cool dance song with kind of a rock-ish flare.  4.5/5<BR>5) The first ballad, 'Be With You' is a very sensual, mature song.  Great vocals.  5/5<BR>6) 'Me, Myself, and I' is definitely the album's sweet spot.  It's a mid-tempo song with beautiful vocals.  5/5<BR>7) 'Yes' has a trippy beat and is a little boring.  It does have a great message.  4/5<BR>8) 'Signs' is great vocally, but lyrically, nothing impressive.  2.5/5<BR>9) 'Speechless' is saved by the wonderful vocals.  The song seems a little repetitive to me.  1.5/5<BR>10) The second Jay-Z collaboration on the album, 'That's How You Like It,' cannot even come close to 'Crazy in Love.'  I found it to be VERY bland.  .5/5<BR>11) 'The Closer I Get to You.'  I have only one word to describe this song: BEAUTIFUL!  5/5<BR>12) I don't really know why she re-did 'Dangerously in Love.'  It's nothing compared to the original.  2.5/5<BR>13) I'm not going to rate the 'Beyonce Interlude.'<BR>14) 'Gift From Virgo' is pretty, but somewhat boring.  3/5<BR>15) The hidden track, 'Daddy,' is kind of sappy, but a nice tribute to the man who practically made Beyonce's career, her father.  3/5
B000001Y5J|5.0|I've liked Nine Inch Nails for a long time, but I dont own too many of thier cds. I knew that Trent had covered Physical and I really wanted to hear his version of the song. Adam Ant is my favorite artist EVER and Physical is a great song. I had read the reviews for this cd before buying it and found it interesting that people said Trent had put his own spin on it, changed it, blah blah blah. I was curious to see how he had changed the song.Obviously the people who said that it was originally a pop song or that Trent changed it have never heard the original song. He really didn't change it much at all. Yes he gave it an industrial edge, but he sang it just like Adam did. He changed the beginning of the song and that is the biggest change I heard. Adam and the Ants were never a pop band (even after Adam went solo- he did do some pop type songs, but he was always different then everyone else), and Trent has said what a big Adam Ant fan he is. He didn't cover the song as a joke. He covered it because its a great song by one of the most original, most creative artists of our time. You should really listen to a song before you start making comparisons. I needed to get that off my chest.<br />Everyone has already said what a great cd Broken is. I have nothing else to add really. It is louder then some of thier other stuff, but if you like NIN there is no reason you wont like this one too. I thought it was great. Buy it.
B000002IOW|5.0|Stylistically, Presto is a lot closer to late 80's pop than the epic prog and arena rock that Rush is most famous for, which is probably the reason that many purist Rush fans brush it aside. This is too bad, because Presto is one of Rush's most melodic, accessible, and mature albums. As a lyricist, Neil Peart has grown up impressively. He no longer writes with the detached pedantry and stilted symbolism that marred some of his earlier songs, but now speaks directly, wryly, and sympathetically to the listener. The music reflects this new comfort with a more straightforward, less overloaded approach, and the result is positively hypnotic. Alex Lifeson's fluid guitar lines, Neil Peart's rythmic drumming, and Geddy Lee's mantra-like vocals intertwine to create a sublime emotional resonance that you don't have to be a fan of prog rock to get.<br />I bought this CD when I was a sophomore in college, and the music very much connected with the state of mind I was in at the time: wistful, hopeful, standing alone under cloudy skies at the edge of campus, watching students in motion between classes, feeling both restless in and at peace with the world around me. There are some good rockers, such as &quot;Superconductor&quot; and &quot;Red Tide&quot;, but it was more melodic songs like &quot;The Pass&quot;, &quot;Anagram&quot;, &quot;Presto&quot;, &quot;Hand over Fist&quot;, and &quot;Available Light&quot; that echoed and enhanced my charged inner atmosphere. And &quot;Scars&quot;, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful Rush songs ever. Track down the incredible live version if you can.<br />Yes, when I was 18, I may have thought that Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures were the bees knees, but now that I'm ten years older, I recognize that Presto is a more accomplished work. The &quot;old&quot; Rush may have made you want to pump your fist in the air, but this one will make you pause and reflect. Even if you don't consider yourself a fan of this band, if you enjoy beautiful songwriting, get this album -- you will be surprised. If you ARE a Rush fan, then note the respective attitudes of those writing the positive and negative reviews and make up your own mind.<br />(Also recommended: Roll the Bones, another underrated classic)
0385509456|5.0|Writing this first novel from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old, Mark Haddon takes the reader into the chaos of autism and creates a character of such empathy that many readers will begin to feel for the first time what it is like to live a life in which there are no filters to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us through our senses every instant of the day.  For the autistic person, most stimuli register with equal impact, and Christopher's teacher Siobhan, at the special school he attends, has been trying to teach him to deal with the confusing outside world more effectively.  At fifteen he is on the verge of gaining some tenuous control over the mass of stimuli which often sidetrack him.<br />When the dog across the street is stabbed and dies, Christopher decides to solve the mystery and write a book about it.  His favorite novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, becomes his model as he investigates the crime, uncovering many secrets involving his own family in the process.  Innocent and honest, he sees things logically and interprets the spoken word literally, unable to recognize the clues which would tell him if someone is being dishonest, devious, or even facetious.  As he tells his story in a simple subject-verb-object sentence pattern, Christopher tries to communicate and give order to his world, and the reader can easily see how desperate he is to find some pattern which will enable him to make sense of it.<br />Christopher's investigations eventually require him to make some remarkably brave decisions, and when he faces his fears and moves beyond his immediate neighborhood, the magnitude of this challenge is both dramatic and poignant.  Strange places have always been traumatic for him, and he has difficulties with his emotions.  \\"Feelings,\\" he says, \\"are just having a picture on the screen in your head.\\"  He responds either with logic or with the anger which sometimes overwhelms him as result of fear or frustration, and the reader cannot help aching for him and empathizing with his family.<br />Christopher's coming-of-age story is most unusual, if not unique, and he ends the book a much more mature 15-year-old than he was when he started.  With warmth and humor, Haddon creates a fascinating main character, allowing the reader to share in his world and experience his ups and downs, his trials and successes.  In providing a vivid world in which the reader participates vicariously, Haddon fulfills the most important requirements of fiction, entertaining at the same time that he broadens the reader's perspective and allows him to gain knowledge.

B000050XEI|5.0|I must say that Enya is a wonderful musician.  I have all of her albums, and this is one of my favorites.  To me, the best song on this album is, &quot;One By One.&quot;  Most people like change in their favorite artists, but not me.  Enya is at her best now, as she was fifteen years ago.  This is a great album to relax to, and one that definitely could open the floodgates of emotion.  I recommend this album for anyone!
B000059ZLH|5.0|Since I will have the pleasure of seeing Dream Theater in concert this coming Thursday, July 10th (along with Queensryche and Fates Warning), I think it's about time I reviewed their marvelous DVD called METROPOLIS 2000: SCENES FROM NEW YORK.  I've had this DVD since April of last year, but I never got a chance to give it a justifiable review.  It seemed I was too speechless to do so.  Not anymore. Since I'm hyped about this performance, I can finally speak my peace, if you will.<br />As you already guessed, this is the DVD counterpart for the live album LIVE SCENES FROM NEW YORK, which featured the entire full-length concert on three CDs.  On the DVD however, it contains the band's final full performance of their classic concept album SCENES FROM A MEMORY from beginning to end.  Although ironically, the sound quality of the CDs are superior to that of the DVD, nevertheless the picture quality is awesome and DT puts on a fiery, blistering performance that never lets up as soon as &quot;Overture 1928&quot; gets rolling.<br />Listening to this August 30, 2000 concert on CD is a great experience.  Watching it is an entirely overwhelming experience altogether.  Witnessing John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, and Jordan Rudess go off on their instruments is jaw-dropping to watch.  If you really didn't believe these guys could play like that, then you REALLY won't believe the stuff they do here.  Lead singer James LaBrie is very strong vocally throughout, and John Myung, despite standing perfectly still the whole time, holds things together with his fast and fluid six-string bass.<br />To bring the SCENES story to life, the band uses actual movie footage (shot in Sweden) on the screens behind them as &quot;reenactments&quot; for the events described in the lyrics.  I didn't mind the movie footage, but the psychedelic images that pop up here and there are pretty distracting.  Sometimes they look cool (like during &quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot;) and other times they frustrate (during &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot;).  At least they use them occasionally and they don't detract for the overall power of the concert.  There's even a live narrator for &quot;Regression&quot; which was a neat touch.<br />There are a ton of great moments on here, but these have to be the best: the killer opening combo of &quot;Overture 1928&quot; and &quot;Strange Deja Vu&quot;; the band literally going nuts during the instrumental jam section of &quot;Beyond This Life&quot;; the dark, haunting rendition of &quot;Home&quot;; the breakneck performance of &quot;Dance of Eternity&quot;; and &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; which reaches an emotional, spiritual peak by bringing out Teresa Thompson and the full gospel choir to sing along with James.<br />The special features are also excellent.  There's an insightful yet hilarious audio commentary with the entire band, discussing how the story, album, and music came into place; a short behind-the-scenes documentary; and bonus live footage from the concert's second set, comprised of the &quot;Mind Beside Itself&quot; trilogy, &quot;Learning to Live,&quot; and the 23-minute juggernaut &quot;A Change of Seasons.&quot;<br />This is a really great DVD.  Dream Theater prove that they can pull off their complex, intricate music on stage and still know how to have fun.  If the July 10th concert is anywhere near as good as this, I will be very impressed.
B000003S0P|5.0|The King Crimson collective has earned a reputation for the highly experimental nature and short-lived lifespan of its lineups; the payoff of such cross-fertilization has been a series of revolutionary &quot;progressive rock&quot;/avant-rock albums, like this one, Red, from '74. This one in particular was the last record from the seminal 70s KC lineup of Robert Fripp-John Wetton-Bill Bruford, +/- violinist David Cross. Where Crimson's UK counterparts Yes were busy spinning sunny and pleasant yarns, KC peddled a much darker and heavier post-modernist vision, drawing upon dissonant 20-century classical music, the avant-garde, and even strains of prototypical &quot;heavy-metal,&quot; together with abnormally bizarre and disturbing uses of violin, mellotron, and occasionally trumpet and saxophone. Songs like the title track and &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; show Crimson at their alarming, avant-garde best--slashing, atonal guitar figures, throaty rumbling basswork, and the deft, restless odd-time percussive fury of Bill Bruford. Parts of &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; and &quot;Starless,&quot; meanwhile, highlight the band's penchant for moody, dark chamber-pop ballads, lushly textured with mellotrons, winds, and hypnotic Frippian sound effects. Sandwiched between is one of the band's finest examples of improvisation in &quot;Providence,&quot; with a creepy violin-led opening seemingly lifted off a horror-film soundtrack, followed by a volcanic odd-meter explosion from Fripp/Wetton/Bruford as the early '70s most demented power trio. This album represents the most concise, accessible and mature documentation of the work of the Fripp/Bruford/Cross/Wetton lineup, and is not to be missed.
0140131558|2.0|Somewhere along the way Paul Auster was decreed a &quot;literary author,&quot; so if you dare to say he's boring, pretentious, and not really all that good with words, you are simply one of the great unwashed who don't get it.  The first two novels in this book  book are flat our lousy, no two ways about it (I lost the book after the I slogged through the second novel and didn't much miss it.  The concluding story looked better than the other two but that ain't saying much).  Auster's characters are wan bloodless abstractions.  You can have abstractions in your stories and still write engaging stuff, look at Kafka, but make us feel for your abstractions; that's the secret.  Auster doesn't come close to managing this feat.  Auster writes &quot;literature&quot; for philosophy students who never got literature or maybe &quot;philosophy&quot; for English students who never understood philosophy.  At any rate it's boring and self important drivel, worse when you  get down to it Mr. Auster's great insights are really rather insipid.  They're the kinds of things fifteen year olds happen on and feel really, really deep and special for thinking of, for a year or two anyway.  James Ellroy and Dashiell Hammett have written much better books, but unfortunately they're crime authors so we can't take them seriously now can we?  But Mr. Auster, talentless though he may be, is a literary author, deigning to write crime albeit in an oh so clever postmodern way so we can't not him serioulsly at risk of looking dumb.  If you read to actually enjoy a book pick up Ellroy or Hammett, but if you want to impress the grad student crowd at parties then go for Auster.  But you'll always wonder just how many of them actually like him, and how many are just saying they do are because they're too afraid of looking stupid to say differently.

0393057658|4.0|Life is very different in Billy Beane's world.  The much-ballyhooed general manager of the Oakland A's has led a revolution in how major league teams evaluate players and manage their teams.  According to Mr. Beane stolen bases are too risky to attempt, `runs batted in' is a useless stat, and sacrificing is a waste of an out. Five years ago, teams laughed when armchair baseball statisticians suggested that their new stats could give teams an edge in evaluating talent. The laughing has stopped, and stats like OPS, EQA, and VORP are as common at the stadium as hot dogs and foam fingers.<br />The statistical revolution began when Bill James started looking at baseball statistics in a whole new way in the late 1970s.  He began to self-publish his \\"Baseball Abstract\\", and stats would never be the same.  Now, the A's have Harvard educated computer geeks who have never put on a baseball jersey pouring over statistics such as on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS (on-base plus slugging). These Ivy-league whiz kids have just as much, if not more, input than the scouts who have been watching the game since before Sandy Koufax was taking the mound.<br />Faced with the daunting task of documenting the revolution of baseball statistics and explaining those stats to the average fan, Michael Lewis has struck gold. This book reads like a gripping piece of fiction.  Mr. Lewis brilliantly weaves humorous anecdotes and bits of baseball history into a documentation of Oakland's season. From draft day to the postseason, \\"Moneyball\\" shows how Billy Beane pulls more strings from the front office than Art Howe does from the dugout. This book will change the way you watch baseball.<br />If you don't read \\"Moneyball\\" you're going to be left out of the baseball conversation for the next five years.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I did not see this movie in theaters because I wasn't quite sure what type of movie it was supposed to be. And when I first watched the DVD, I kept napping (okay, I had just worked 3 12-hour shifts back to back). It took a rewatch to figure out what Scorcese was after.  The key is Opera.  This movie is classically operatic in scope, theme, production value, and rich over-the-top plumminess.   <BR>There are 4 stand-outs:  Bill the Butcher, the Five Points, the music, and the haunting final scene.  The supporting characters of Priest, Monk, Tweed,and Mulraney are also very well-portrayed.  The younger actors, bankable stars DiCaprio and Diaz, are, by comparison, noticeable as actors rather than disappearing into their characters. Their accents come and go, and they don't yet have the experience to carry off a period piece without looking and sounding anachronistic. Henry Thomas manages his craft best of the young actors.  <BR>But back to the stars.  Daniel Day-Lewis simply never does anything wrong. The sets and costumes are gorgeously dramatic, and yes, colors were crazy at that time. Aniline dyes had just been discovered, and everyone was wearing heinously gaudy combinations. And the music; the combination of period barsongs, Scottish and Irish folktunes, U2 and Peter Gabriel - wonderful! The use of music as it would occur naturally (the singers in the bar, the different dancing scenes, the Chinese opera, the pep band before the battle) - fantastic! I had to buy the soundtrack immediately.
B00005JM09|2.0|From the moment Arnold says \\"You're terminated,\\" this picture falls apart. There are several places in the picture where you wonder if the screenwriters even saw the first two films, though you tend to ignore them because Arnold and the other actors are doing good work, and the setpiece destruction is well-staged. But you do notice Skynet's takeover. That was described in T2, and it's not what happens in T3. Then we are asked to believe a father outright lies to his daughter with his dying breath. That leads to an ending that is totally in violation of the series' premise (till now) -- a saying repeated in both films: \\"The future is not set. Our future is what we make of it.\\" This picture's premise is: \\"The future IS set, and there's nothing we can do about it.\\" Maybe if all this had been set up it would have worked, though I doubt it. You can't change core tenets of a film series and have it work. T3 does just that, and it doesn't work.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie was a nearly perfect adaptation of the book. Everything and everyone looked and sounded just right. The people who have problems with the book will have similar problems with the movie, so faithfulness was definitely the right choice. But some of the things that work well in print, i.e. Dumbledore's exposition, tend to drag on screen. Simply talking faster would have helped - even children can hear faster than people can talk. Daniel Radcliffe is a very talented young actor. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson still make some typical &quot;child actor&quot; mistakes, but they are relatively few, and hopefully the director won't include so many &quot;gulps&quot; from Ron in the next movies. And all the adults are perfectly cast, especially Alan Rickman as Snape. <BR>Jumping through hops to find  the deleted scenes in the DVD was very annoying. The game itself might have been fun, but for an adult, being required to play was ludicrous.
0156027321|5.0|I hesitated to read this book because I had learned that the premise was unoriginal.  There is an older Brazilian book about a boy and a jaguar adrift on a lifeboat.  Yann Martel coyly credits the Brazilian author in his acknowledgments without revealing that he borrowed the plot.  Now, never having read the first book, I am certain that Life of Pi, wherever Martel got his idea, is a gem.  There may be another out there, but this one has facets and flaws that make it unlike anything written. <br />Piscine Molitor Patel,&quot;Pi&quot;, is an engaging, funny and heartbreaking narrator.  Richard Parker, the tiger with whom Pi is trapped on a lifeboat, is as well crafted a character as any human. Yet Martel never steps over the line into anthropomorphism; Richard Parker is every bit a tiger.  Martel's sense of place, be it a zoo in India, a university in Tornonto or a charmed deserted island in the midst of the Pacific is mesmerizing.  The sense of the fantastical reminded me of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the magical realism of many South American writers but the voice of Pi is completely unique.  He is a masterful story teller throughly enjoying spinning a very good story.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Like the books, this second installment is darker and more action-oriented than the first.  Again, Columbus has chosen the faithful route, again, the correct choice.  I would have liked a little less emphasis on the action scenes - when you know that the characters are going to survive for at least another couple of chapters, the multiple life-threatening situations lose some of their nailbiting tension.  And the whole movie needed some tightening, i.e. Dumbledore's exposition could have simply been spoken faster.  And I missed some of the little touches and visions of &quot;ordinary wizard life&quot; that Rowling tosses out so delightfully. <BR>I hope that the actors will be able to return for the remaining stories. Daniel Radcliffe has a maturity and talent beyond his years. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are improving nicely.  And the adults continue to be perfectly cast - the best British actors playing the best British wizards!
B00000K3UR|4.0|this comedy, as all Sandler's movies, is to have a good time. Adam Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a single guy who ilegally adopts a little kid, and this last one will eventually become a part of his life. To take care of the child he decides to make a fantasy world without rules and obstacles; in other words, he loves the boy in a very special way. What makes you wanna keep on seeing the movie is that the central theme is seen as something not necessaryly serious, so it is fun to see what's gonna happen next with this particular pair of &quot;clawns&quot;. I recommend it because of its joy-transmition and pretty funny ex SaturdayNightLive-actors. You won't regret seeing it.
0140277447|5.0|I am shocked that some Americans or non-chinese would argue about the number of civilians killed by Japanese troops. There have been extensive research/witness and numerous books, TV programs, movies about this massacre in China. This was not some collateral damage, trust me. Even some Japanese scholars admitted the number of 300,000 is about correct. <BR>The lack of understanding and basic knowledge on chinese/Asian history by some of the reviewers here is purely shocking, but I have to admire their courage for speakin out on something they don't have the first clue about ...
B000002HMH|3.0|While not as fast or intense as previous Metallica fare, there is still a lot to like about Load.  It offers a good mix of hard rock styles and the lyrics are actually fairly interesting.  Unfortunately, this album pales in comparison to Metallica's previous work and older fans will be disappointed by this effort.<br />This is not to say that there are not decent songs on Load.  &quot;King Nothing&quot;, &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, and &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; are personal favorites of mine and &quot;Hero of the Day&quot; and &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; are mainstream mainstays.<br />Overall, this album is a good buy for hard rock fans, or Metallica fans with varied musical tastes.  Hardcore metal fans, however, should look elsewhere.
B00007JVBI|2.0|How promising this CD begins.  \\"I Don't Blame You\\" is of the highest quality, and alone is a five star piece. The tragedy of her soulful and metaphoric lyrics are beautifully captured in her soft croon.  The next track, \\"Free,\\" is a bit less interesting, but is worth four stars.  Cat's repetition sounds like chanting, as though she's trying to perform an excorsism on her audience; trying to free them from the grasp of the stars.  The last decent track, as far as I'm concerned is \\"Fool\\", a strong statement about the American Way.  <br />As for the rest, well, it seems like maybe she decided three good songs was plenty, and just started writing about pointless [stuff], that even she doesn't seem to care about.
0790729628|4.0|To be completely honest, I have never seen the original version of \\"Blade Runner,\\" with Harrison Ford's voice-overs and \\"happy\\" ending.  However, I was intrigued to see the directors' cut, to see if the story really needed explaining and, more importantly, if it does live up to  its reputation of a visionary cult classic.  And I am happy to say it does.  Set in Los Angeles in the year 2019, overpopulation has forced many to live on space colonies rather than on earth.  Androids called replicants were made to aid in the construction and mining projects off-world.  But a few revolt, and they are banned on earth.  Special police officers called Blade Runners are created to destroy any replicant on earth.  One Balde Runner in particular, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is at the center of the film, tracking down five rouge replicants (led by a superb Rutger Hauer) who are trying to find a way to their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkell).  <br />What makes the film so memorable, is not only the visual flair of Ridley Scott, but its shrewd discussion on the moral issues surrounding the replicants.  Taking the themes from the Philip Dick story \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,\\" one squarely in the foreground is if the replicnts have the capacity to feel emotion, are they really just machines?  Rick Deckard has a hard time with the concept, as will you, considering the impassioned search embarked on by Rutger Hauer and his comrades.  And there is Ridley Scott.  The style and and look of \\"Blade Runner\\" is vintage Scott, with meticulous, atmospheric direction and sleek cinematography to paint a noir Los Angeles in the near future.  Also, the production design and set decoration are impressive.  Dark, gritty and so utterly believable.<br />When \\"Blade Runner\\" was originally released, it was so with a voice-over.  When you watch the director's cut, you wonder why Warner Brothers thought it was needed in the first place.  The story is quite able to tell itself, without Harrison Ford explaining it to you.  It is true that you need to pay attention to the film when you watch it, but unless its the new \\"Charlies' Angels\\" or someting like it, you need to pay attention to the movie to get it anyway.  And \\"Blade Runner\\" has enough dark visual brilliance to make you way to pay attention to it in the first place.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Well, where do I start? This cd is amazing I've owned it for almost 4 years now and I never got tired of it. It's a cd with a great mix of happy get you on your feet songs and sad moody songs to help you deal with a bad day. The lyrics are very meaningful and deep and in some ways helps you realise you are not alone.The music is relaxing with a hint of sadness feeling that gives the cd it's real touch of losing love and finding love where you least expect it. I can't say enough about how great this cd is. After listening to it,it leaves you with a comforting feeling of thought and a feeling of not being alone. However, the band isn't together anymore doesn't stop this cd from shining in it's own light. If you're reading this review stop and click the buy cd button because you'll be glad you did. It's a cd that belongs in every music collection.
B000002IPZ|5.0|Souls Of Black is a great album by Testament. I can't understand why there are so many negative reviews. Sure there are a few fillers but some of the songs are amazing. For example the songs Souls Of Black, Seven Days Of May, and The Legacy are some of the best songs Testament have ever done. The highlight of this album is the guitar of Alex Skolnick, he really rips it up on this album, even more then on there previous efforts. The Legacy is an amazing ballad and Skolnicks solos on that song are just amazing. I really don't see what there is on this album that seems to be not likable. Everything is great, there are awesome riffs, cool lyrics and vocals, and some of the best guitar solos I have ever heard. If you like Testament or thrash metal then your collection cant be complete without Souls Of Black. I can't imagine my life if I had never heard the song The Legacy, it is that awesome. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This album just comes to prove that Iron Maiden are still a great metal band, even though their style has changed over time. However their progressive sound gives a more mature and melodic portrail of their musical evolution. This album is more accessible than many older ones but this does not mean it is more commercial. Unlike some bands (Metallica!) Maiden is still Maiden. They are an example for all of what a band should be and how progression and change does not mean selling out! THis is a great buy for all metal fans who are maybe more open to a more melodic and lighter sound. All the songs on this are great, especially Blood Brothers and The Nomad. The album is quite instrumental in some parts and this ads to the very &quot;epicy&quot; sound of the thing. Dickinson's signing is great and Steve Harris is still amazing. The only hitch is tha lack of melodic apport that may have been brought by 3 guitars. When u listen to the album u basically only hear 2 guitars. But this is just a detail. This is one of the last if not the last great metal bands and if u're looking for quality music get this!
B00005JM09|4.0|The Terminator movies are for today's audience what the Planet of the Apes, Heston and McDowell not Walberg, were for our parents.  Fortunately for us, the studios have repaired a major flaw of those films by increasing the budgets as opposed to cutting them.  The early chase scene budget would probably equall the budget of the last of the Ape series films.<BR>     I can't honestly give the film a 5 star rating as I felt it was too short for the film's transition.  The final, although very good, seemed a little rushed.  There are several scenes of action and the usual one liners that all action movies have adopted.  The film is essential a sequel and follows the same successful formula of it's predecessors, so I can not give it credit for originallity.  What I can say positive about the film was that I saw it on Manday after the big weekend.  The theater was not entirely full at 2:30 in the afternoon, but there were several people present.  When the credits rolled and the lights came up, I noticed several people my age 35+ (who had probably seen the original and the T2 in theaters)who were quite happy with the film.<BR>     My point being that the film is what an action film is supposed to be, entertaining.  I have read several reviews and most of them were positive.  The few I have read that were negative can be categorized as follows:<BR>1) Worshippers at the gates of James Cameron.  These purist damn the film in most reviews for this simple fact alone.  Cameron didn't direct so the film is automatically flawed.<BR>2)  Keepers of the flame.  These are the ones who complain about the change in the stories direction.  They often complain about T3 spurring away from the Terminator's philosophical edge.  These people have difficulty in seeing that T3 is simply the logical progression of T1 and T2.  T1 presented us with the logical fear of placing to much faith in machines much like the films Wargames, Matrix and Colossus.  T2 continued the transition of that fear to an impending doom and dealt with the possibility of altering that fate with a single act.  (Any Science fiction purist would have to know, that had they truely changed the future, they would have altered the past as well.  John Conner's father is his friend from the future.)  T3 continues the Philosophical line of can the future be altered by events in the past.  Though this particular line is not answered it is curious that both the machines and man belive that it is a posibility.  One point sorely missed by these critics is the fact that this time John is informed of his impending death.  With this knowledge, will he now prevent this from happening or will he fall prey to what has already happened in the future.<BR>3)  Cast Purist.  There is no Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong, in fact only Arnold and, in one suprisingly fresh comic moment, a lesser character of T2 return in this film.  Most hate the new John Conner.  The new John Conner is still uneasy in his role as future leader.  His reluctance is present until the end of the film.  As far as Nick Stahl (John Conner)is concerned, I could listen to him speak over Furlong any day.  His performance may not be stellar, but I never felt the need to reach in the screen and slap him on the back of the head .<BR>4) And Finally.  Why is the robot a woman?  The terminator was created for the sole purpose of infiltration and termination of human resistance.  Review T1 for those who have forgotten this.  The first ones looked human but lacked the essentials needed to truely pass this off up close.  The machines evolved on the product to compensate for errors.  A female terminator is a natural progression in this process.  A predominately male resistance force is more likely to take in a female over a male, especially if that male has the potential to be a robot.<BR>     The end result of the film is really as I said before.  If you have never seen a film in the series, it is easy to follow and still entertaining.  Its an action movie, and although a bit formulaic, it still delivers.  I Saw it with by daughter (9), and my mother (54), and both enjoyed it.
B00005B36H|3.0|Kin Crimson is the Tool Influence hear the projects!
B00006LI26|5.0|The vocals are a bit scratchy and hard to understand, but this album is totally brillaint. There isn't a single track on it that I don't like. It's harder than Helloween's later CDs for sure; this may be a good or bad thing depending on the person. When you want something with nonstop metal power, this is the CD to get. The inclusion of an entire separate EP and a bonus track in addition to the original album makes it that much better.<br />This is definitely going to become one of my favorite CDs.
B000002UA5|5.0|This album is only for those in possesion of and willing to use marijuana. Some of the songs are fantastic on Ummagumma, except you have no idea what they're about because your too \\"regular\\". On the other hand, some of the songs are so perfectly, Pink Floyd-ly done that its amazing. My personal favorite is Granchester Meadows (which happens to be a little \\"Zeppelin\\" sounding). Well, overall, an excellent album, as long as you've got the right herbs.
B00004LN16|3.0|10 years after the smash hit &quot;THE RAZORS EDGE&quot; we get &quot;STIFF UPPER LIP&quot;.  And 4 years after there disappointing but not the worst AC/DC album ever , &quot;BALLBREAKER&quot;.  I gave it 3 stars because it's your typical AC/DC album.  It's been almost 30 years and they haven't changed a bit (go figure).  This album reminds me of Back In Black in many ways.  Such as, a lot of people like me are just getting into AC/DC.  It also has some very catchy tunes , and some of them are bluesy as well.  Like for there first single &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; very catchy and nice to sing along to, then we have &quot;Safe In New York City&quot; kinda has that bluesy sound to it but all in all it's a good song.  Brian Johnson's vocals aren't that bad in this album , but they've certainly improved since &quot;BALLBREAKER&quot;.  If they continue to make CD's such as this one I still will be buying there records and supporting them.  I saw them about 2 years ago and they still put on a great f'n show (even 20 years later)!  Even there new stuff sounds a whole lot better than these new bands out there , I'm just relieved we still have one of the greatest rock n' roll bands that still remain from the 70's...AC/DC
B000005RNQ|5.0|Turn it UP and let the good times Rock and Roll. Saxon defined NWOBHM with this album and the 3 preceeding. Not Iron Maiden, not Judas Priest (they had already been around for ages!), not Diamond Head - although they drew progressive into Metal, not Motorhead, but SAXON.<br />I would highly recommend the previous album, Strong Arm of the Law to go with this, but the music has been severely mangled on the CD version, sound-quality wise.<br />It's worth tracking down a vinyl copy and a turntable just for Saxon's output - if you're a true Metal fan.<br />Saxon were notorious as being the loudest of the metal bands in the 1980s - which is saying something against AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Motorhead. There were reports of bleeding ears from the front rows, and complaints from miles away following some of the earlier gigs. <br />There's no point reviewing the tracks on this album - they're all killers, OK. Welcome to Heavy Metal - and don't take it seriously, alright?<br />If you haven't got this - why not, metalheadz?
B00006V9A0|3.0|Like many other reviews here , if you own NEVERMIND or IN UTERO you really don't need the cd.  But if your're a die hard NIRVANA fan like me , then by all means buy it!  It's a great collection of all the hits that made them famous like.....&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.  Another thing that cought my eye was that &quot;Dumb&quot; was on here.  It's a good song in my point of view but, I don't think it was a HUGE hit with the mainstream audience.  If you're just getting into NIRVANA I highly recommend this CD.  But if you want to take a chance I'd try IN UTERO or BLEACH.  Don't be afraid to try something other than NEVERMIND.  If you do buy NEVERMIND it's like buying the greatest hits.  But then again not everybody likes NIRVANA , they'd rather listen to STAIND...
B00006AW2G|5.0|I was 13 when this record came out. My first stones concert was 1975 in Baton Rouge,La. where I stood in front of a \\"group\\" that would forever keep me playing my guitar and singing.

B000003TA4|4.0|Nevermind this review and buy the damn cd!  You've heard the singles &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit, &quot;Come As You Are&quot; &quot;In Bloom&quot;, and &quot;Lithium&quot;, not impressed yet?  Well it's filled with great deep cuts as well , like &quot;Drain You&quot;, &quot;On A Plain&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, and &quot;Something in the Way&quot;.  The bass lines , guitar, and drums are all at top notch on this CD.  It's a great follow-up to there most underrated cd BLEACH.  Why do so many bands these days try and copy there style of music?  Puddle of Mudd, Staind...ring a bell?  If NIRVANA were still around they'd still make great music and blow all these new bands out of the water!
B00005JKG7|4.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog,\\" although lacking complete originality, is a scary movie in its own respects. \\"The Fog\\" features Jamie Lee Curtis, who also starred in Carpenter's famous film, \\"Halloween.\\" However, I felt that Curtis' performance was not one as good as her others such as \\"Trading Places.\\"<br />The fog itself is probably the scariest part of the movie, or when the little old lady opening up the door. After awhile, though, you would think people would understand not to open the door.<br />Parts like showing the downtown scene with the fog rolling through was a bit strange. The buildings, whether they be real or not, looked very fake. Also, Carpenter left you hanging at the end, leaving many people waiting for a sequel. Unfortunately, \\"The Fog\\" didn't make it at the box office.<br />Overall, I gave \\"The Fog\\" four stars for its graphic scenes and ability to scare. It doesn't quite reach five stars, this film just didn't have the original idea.
B000066F6H|4.0|These Swedes have reminded us what rock is supposed to sound like. Veni Vidi Vicious is an awesome backlash against today's homogenous, musically boring wallows in causeless angst that pose as the continuation of early 90s grunge.  The Hives are beautifully minimalistic, with an incredible energy matched today only by The White Stripes and maybe The Strokes. Leave it to The Hives, The White Stripes, and The Strokes to save rock from what it's becoming at the hands of other groups-- sad, bored, and drained.  Not since Nirvana-- yes Nirvana, though they aren't the next Nirvana by any means-- has rock felt such energy and promise. Veni Vidi Vicious, like Nevermind, Elephant, and Is This It, packs in one great song after another, and the album only gets better with every listen.  All I can say is, it's about damn time.
B00005JM09|5.0|Warning: This review contains spoilers<br />It's safe to say that my expectations for this film were rather low when I went in to see it. Sequels that are held off this long (12 years) are rarely worth it, and the third movie is usually where these franchises start coming undone. Thankfully, within the first five minutes, all of my fears were put to rest. James Cameron is missing-in-action as director, and at the helm this time is the relatively unknown Jonathan Mostow, who injects his own flavor into the science-fiction/action genre and breathes new life into the franchise, while staying true to the roots. This movie is simply amazing. I would even use the word 'epic' to describe it. If you are familiar with the first two 'Terminator' flicks, you will be salivating at most of the scenes. There are also worries about characters that are missing and casting changes, but those should be put to rest as well. This movie benefits from starting from scratch again with it's characters and giving us new problems. I wasn't about ready to watch Linda Hamilton discipline Edward Furlong again for another 2 hours. The movie follows John Connor, now a young adult, who is homeless and as he puts it \\"lives off the grid.\\" He thinks that he has prevented Judgment Day, but in his heart, he feels it is just yet to come. Sarah Connor, his mother, has passed away, and he is on his own. Not fifteen minutes into the movie, John discovers that there is a new batch of Terminators sent to his time yet again, one, is the loveable Arnie model, sent to protect him. The other is the unstoppable T-X (a.k.a The Terminatrix) who is an improved model over the T-1000 from part 2 and is, well, female. The movie moves at a non-stop pace. This movie gave me the adrenaline rush that 'The Matrix: Reloaded' needed, promised, and lacked. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire hour and fifty minutes this movie lasted. The story sucks you in, as it is revealed that Judgment Day is quickly coming up on the horizon and there may be nothing John or his allies can do to stop it. The whole movie has an underlying feeling of doom. Because Judgment Day is inevitable, and no matter what he does, the walls will come crashing down around John Connor. I have to say that I had a massive grin on my face when the machines started taking over. We have been hearing about it all for so long, it was amazing to finally see it happen. And it was all pulled off so well. This movie takes a lot of risks that most summer-blockbusters don't take. For one thing, it stays true to its roots and is a real fan-pleaser. Instead of providing a story that any newcomer can follow, this installment is a continuation of previous events and helps put all the pieces of the puzzle back together. Also, the movie is relatively violent, bleak and sprinkled with a bit of dark humor. It all works maginificently. I can't hand this movie enough compliments. All I can say to you is, put your fears aside. You can waste your time wondering what this movie would be like had Cameron directed it, but as it is, Jonathan Mostow contributed an exciting and fresh sequel to the franchise, that, tastefully enough, leaves room for more. Let's just hope T4 makes it here before the summer of 2015.horizon and there may be nothing John or his allies can do to stop it. The whole movie has an underlying feeling of doom.

B00008J2DQ|5.0|Serenity when your calm and ready to crash for a good nap. I...have you for when your in the mood to just break something. I AM to remind you that your all by yourself most of the time. These are the sounds and ideas of the new CD \\"Faceless\\" Its the best Godsmack have come up with yet. The edge. Sully's hott voice. The tight band in the backround. A perfect mix for the rock lover. A must have for all Godsmack fans. So if you don't have it already.. Go get it before its gone
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time!  Every clever writing in the screenplay isn't displayed very often in other movies.  The producers hired a brilliant hairstylist and costume designer.  The character's appearances match perfectly with all other aspects of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.  Reese Witherspoon is a terrific actress, especially here.  If you're looking for a great and unique comedy, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is perfect.  Even the men will enjoy this.  By the way, I wonder if the &quot;bend and snap&quot; really works.
B000002KO3|5.0|The first question to ask is, how did they do it? I mean an album this unbelievable couldn't have been made by 4 arty New Yorkers, a British jack-of-all-trades producer and an amalgam of side musicians. Somehow, though, they pulled it off. If only the 1980s music-wise had been a progression leading directly from this album, the decade's reputation would be about 50 times better. Nonetheless, even if the album exists in a kind of timeless bubble, it still exists and that's all that matters. I mean, to have four songs as disparate yet complex as The Great Curve (my personal favorite), Once in a Lifetime, The Overload, and Listening Wind on the same album and make it work is beyond me. Everyone goes on and on about the polyrhythmic stuff and the African influences and that's all there but this is still a rock album in the purest sense. It frees inhibitions, makes you really feel alive, and (in a non-cheesy sense) gives you hope. Words alone cannot do justice to Remain in Light-it must be listened to again and again. It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back is the most important album of the '80s but Remain in Light is musically the best.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Some may consider &quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; one of the weirdest movies released in 2000.  If you watch it a second time, you'll know the happenings much better; therefore, you'll understand it better.  The director has a unique style of expression which is seen most with how he expresses the characters' drug use.  He probably did this to show us the gruesome realities of their behavior.  It worked.  This is one of the most daring films released in a long time.  It graphicly explores what many others wouldn't dare: drug use, weight issues, prostitution, etc.  Ellen Burstyn performs in the Oscar nominated role of her career as an ethedryl and television addict.  Jennifer Connelly was dissed for many major awards for her role as a prostitute, as was the movie in whole.  Marlon Wayons marvelously shows his serious side of acting rather than his usual comedy.  Jared Leto portrays a drug addict and trafficker in the best acting role of his career.  &quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; may not be for those who are sensitive to such graphic material.  Those who are not offended by this will enjoy this uniquely drawn movie.
B000002H33|5.0|When I first bought Master of Puppets I was skeptical, not being a huge Metallica fan, but it did not dissapoint but instead reformed me into a lover of thrash metal. Master of Puppets appears a skimpy 8 songs but each song is a work of art in itself and each song clocks out at about 7 minutes. Not once listening to this did I become bored or tired of it. Master of Puppets is one of the few albums I can listen to all the way through.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is one of my favorite Beatles albums.  They showcase their ahead-of-their-time experimental skills, such as reggae, psychodelic, folk, and many more.  Their lyrics seem to be the most personal of their career sensing tentions amongst the band and their personal lives.  They state that they are more than just four guys from Liverpool, England, rather human beings like everyone else.  Every track stands as an anthem for many today's experimental acts like Radiohead, U2, etc.  <br />It's The Beatles, need I say more?
1559409002|5.0|This is one you must watch alone in the dark! It's really scary then. Yes you could watch it with a bunch of buds and make fun of it, but when everyone is gone and nobody is around to hold onto, this movie will move in with it's intense atmosphere and shocking conclusion. Definately a must buy!
B000002UZ1|5.0|These are The Beatles best songs of their final three years.  They prove in this compilation that they are indeed the greatest and most inspirational band of all time.  I'm sure everybody knows that.  Therefore, I shall say: It's The Beatles, need I say more.
B00008J2DR|5.0|Depending on your point of view, Godsmack is ...one of the few(if not the only)real hard rock acts left. It's very rare to find a band so loved or villified with no middle ground. And while this album may only be preaching to the converted, it's one hell of a statement. The band moves away some from it's cookie cutter tendencies and ventures at times into almost Pantera-esque territory. It adds a definite punch to their already potent mix of Sully's growls against grinding guitar and pounding rhythms. As a hedge, the band included the hit \\"I Stand Alone,\\" from The Scorpion King, but the rest of the songs have enough strength of their own. \\"Changes\\" one of the standout tracks, incorporates heavy grooves with even an acoustic passage thown in. Elsewhere, their white knuckle approach is very apparent on the spewing \\"I F***ing Hate You\\" and Sully's life chronical \\"Releasing The Demons.\\" \\"Serenity\\" the album's acoustic closer recalls Jar Of Flies era AIC with its tribal drums and almost psychedelic feel. Now that Pantera's dead and Metallica's sold out, these guys are on top of the game and this album shows it.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Godsmack is another nu-metal type band that puts out unoriginal records that still manage to be listenable. While not quite as juvenile and nerve-grating as Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park (whose recent release METEORA is even more of a carbon copy of their debut than this album is of AWAKE), Godsmack seems far more concerned with the \\"coolness\\" factor than actual songwriting -- the fact that they titled one of their songs \\"I F*cking Hate You\\" disgusts me enough to deduct half a star from the entire album, as it gives you the feeling that these guys really aren't trying.<br />All that aside, there are still some nice songs to bang your head to on here. \\"I Stand Alone\\" is by far the best in my opinion, with the recent single \\"Straight out of Line\\" not too far behind. \\"Serenity\\" is worth mentioning, too, as it seems to replicate the \\"Voodoo\\" formula with some success... I think I still prefer to original, though, as the lyrics on \\"Serenity\\" come off as cheesy and overdone for such a static band. The remaindier of the tracks are up and down... good riffs at times, but nearly every song can be likened to, at best, a combination of songs off their previous two albums, and at worst, a near-replica of a single Godsmack song.<br />The bottom line, though, is that the argument that was immediately made in 1997 upon the release of their debut album is still valid in every way: Alice in Chains, the band from whom Godsmack stole their name, did everything Godsmack has done over the course of the past six years on 1992's stellar DIRT, and they did it with a lot more variety, talent, melody, and originality (not to mention that they then progressed forward in style and released two more classic records with completely different sounds). It is a crime not to own DIRT if you have picked up any Godsmack album. <br />FACELESS is recommended only if you don't mind lack of originality and variety, and if you have already exhausted the supply of older metal albums that blow this out of thewater any day.<br />2.8 stars

0790732203|4.0|Oh my gosh, I can't even begin to describe how fun the movie Risky Business is. The movie is all about Joel (Tom Cruise) who is in his senior year of high school, and really wants to get into Princeton. While his parents are away and Joel is home by himself, he calls up a prostitute named Lana and kind of falls in love with her. Joel is intrested in business, so he and Lana start up a one night brothel @ his house. All through the movie you are left with the same question running through your mind - Does he get into Princeton? The only way you can find out is if you see the movie that started Tom Cruise's acting spree ~ Risky Business!

B00005JM09|1.0|Ok, I love the terminator movies.  The reason is that they had extreme plot twists in them.  <br />T1 - I mean if you think about the first one it blows you away.  The terminator was sent to stop John Connor from being born, but John wouldn't have existed if they hadn't gone back to kill him.  The only reason he was born was due to the fact that Reese was sent to protect his mother.  <br />Another twist was that the terminators wouldn't have existed either if they hadn't gone back to kill Sarah Connor.  The technology to create them came from the remnants of the crushed terminator.  Hence, evil (terminator) and good (John Connor)were created together - one needed the other.<br />T2 - The future is not set.  There is no fate, but what we make.  At the end there is an unsure feeling of the future, but Sarah Connor believes if a terminator can value human life maybe we can too!  Excellent statement.  It made me cry!<br />T3 - This movie discounts itself and what the first two were saying.  I mean after watching the first two, you wonder if Judgment Day would really happen.  You think that this could be reality.  T3 takes out all of the mystery & suspense.  You know it can't be real because at the present time no atomic bombs have gone off.  You realize that this is just a movie.  No well written story, unless it was fantasy in another world, tries to stop the viewer from believing this is happening.  That's why sci-fi usually takes place in the future.  Once it's in the present & portrays the end of the world you know that it's just a story because you're still alive.  <br />After watching T2 I had to keep watch all day on August 29th, 1997.  They should have left it with the same unknown possibility to keep the realistic suspense.  So you could ask yourself, \\"Could this happen?\\"
B000089RVX|5.0|I heard thea Bring Me to Life song and started searching for Linkin' Park in a duet with a woman, finally I realized it was no Linkin' Park, but a great new Band called Evanescence. I guess is not fair to hint that they're copying or imitating Linkin' Park, because after buying the album for my daughter, I STOLE IT BACK!, this group is very original and every song in the album ROCKS, not just the single.<br />That girl can sing!!  and has that sweet, yet powerful voice that haunts you and just make you wanna hear it again and again. Pure HARD ROCK that is really original and innovative.<br />I burned 4 songs already for my car CD, my favorite songs:<BR>Going Under (the best in my opinion)<BR>Bring me to life<BR>My last breath<BR>Whisper (I can hear this girl sing ALL DAY)
0385504209|2.0|The first half of the Da Vinci Code is an exciting murder mystery -- as good as writing gets. I have no criticism of it.<br /> The second half quickly becomes what I would call exciting baloney. In fact, I almost tossed the book away several times but decided I'd better see if the baloney was all an author's trick that might come good in the end. It wasn't. And this was disappointing.<br /> The book is a search for the Holy Grail, but it redefines what the Holy Grail is (first disappointment). The book is actually quite anti-Christian, and I can see that non-Christians who are not too knowledgeable about da Vinci's paintings, and about the Bible, and history, might think the book is possibly factual. But it has errors everywhere. Such as:<br /> It tries to make a case that a hand holding a knife in da Vinci's The Last Supper is not attached to a body. But da Vinci himself said in his notebook that it was an Apostle's hand, and when you look closely at the painting, it certainly is just that.<br /> The author also lists supposedly pagan leaders of the Priory of Sion. But really, when he lists people like scientist Robert Boyle he is on quicksand. Boyle was one of the strongest evangelical Christians of his time and even left a legacy to promote the Gospel in his annual Boyle lectures. There's no way this man would believe the tripe about Mary Magdalene being married to Jesus that the Da Vinci Code tries to make out. There are many similar errors of fact.<br /> As a Christian I found the book disappointing, not because (as the author implies) that people like me are afraid of the truth being revealed, but because it promotes well-documented errors as fact.
6305313687|4.0|The acting in this film, if cut away from the plot and directing, would definitely rate 5 stars.  Unfortunately the other elements of the film drag it down just a bit, but it remains a thought-provoking and affecting film.<br />The plot centers around two sons in a Venice Beach, CA family.  The older son, Derek Vinyard, is a former neo-Nazi skinhead who has just been released from prison (he killed two black men while still a skinhead).  He comes home to find that his younger brother Danny is headed down the same path, and tries to convince Danny to turn his life around before it is too late.  The film starts off very promisingly, with incredible performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.  The only minor annoyance is the use of a contrived technique that uses black-and-white for flashbacks and color for present-day events.  Dialogue is snappy, and the rantings of Norton's character have an eerie half-logic that can almost make you understand why Derek gains so many followers.  There are a string of striking images, such as skinheads bathing a black store clerk in milk during a robbery.  The film stays strong until after its midpoint, but it begins to descend into plot contrivances and melodrama.  These notes make the ending utterly unsatisfying and a little disappointing, considering what came before.  It remains a powerful movie, but tantalizes with the prospect of how great it could have been had the third-act denouement not descended into overdone predicability.<br />A final note:  very interesting casting sees supporting performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, and even Paul Le Mat from \\"American Graffiti\\".
0385504209|5.0|This book is a must read for any history or art lover. I absolutely couldn't put it down. The author's creativity was brilliant. I was constantly on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. It also has many great twists throughout the book.
0553266306|4.0|This is simply vintage Frederick Forsyth, which translates into vintage thriller/espionage material. The suspense of the assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle by an Englishman codenamed the Jackal (hired by the OAS) is maintained at a high level throughout; this is achieved by simultaneously tracking the Jackal's preparations and the French authorities' efforts at stopping him. Both the details of making plans and the action of executing them in the plot are balanced nicely.
B000069AUI|4.0|It reminds me of an old boyfriend, although it was many years ago.  It has that melancholy vibe.  It is really a deeper album than their last issue.
B00005T5VE|2.0|As a Madonna fan, I was and still am so disappointed with this album.  It is my understanding (as stated on the fan club site) that she picked the songs rather than letting fans do so (like Bjork.) I like most of the original versions of these songs but every song on this CD is edited.  I don't understand the running order either, i.e. why these song are in this order.  I made a CD prior to this coming out and all of her singles from this time period and they fit onto an 80 minute CD.  Why did they leave some out?  Immaculate Collection was over 70 minutes long where this barely runs 60 minutes.  Also Immaculate Collect was in order of release and fit so well.  I think that is why Immaculate Collection is still selling records and this one has died off. The only good thing about this CD is the Booklet with a great collection of photos and a hillarious story. Sorry Maddy, you have let me down.
B00005JKN9|3.0|I think this film is over-rated. I watched it yesterday expecting the great movie people say it is. The opening battle is great and makes you think the rest of the movie will be that good....but it's not. I sat through the very long length expecting a big battle at the end to top the one in the beginning. However the battle at the end is hardly a battle at all, the one in the beginning is a lot longer and much better.<br />  The film starts out with Amsterdam wittnessing his father brutally killed by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) in a great opening battle. Amsterdam returns to where his father was killed seeking revenge against Bill. He gets close to him, as a trusted servant and finds himself almost even liking him and getting almost as bad as him.<br />  I liked the beginning more than the whole movie but it was still entertaining after that but it falls part in the half hour. I expected a big confrontation between Bill and Amsterdam at the end but you never get it. Their battle is short and disapointing and not worth 2 1/2 hours to wait for. Which leaves Daniel Day Lewis's performance the only reason to really stick with the movie. Surprisingly Cameron Diaz is very good as well in a serious role for once. DiCaprio  is alright but his performance in (Catch Me If You Can) is much much more impressive. Martin Scorsese had a good vision for the film but it fails to be as good as a lot of his other films.
B000099T2L|3.0|The in-CD posters of Beyonce are nice :) The first two times I listened, I wound up switching CDs, though.  The first few songs are pretty tight, but after that I got tired of the theme. I know the title of the CD is 'Dangerously in Love' but I thought it was a bit TOO 'lovey-dovey.' <BR>Once I listened to the entire CD, I found the song with Luther to be good, and didn't care much for the 'Signs' song. Maybe the songs will grow on me if I hear them more.
B000099T2L|3.0|I think we all already knew Beyonce would come out with an explosive album.  Glossy, well produced, and collaborations with the best.  Well there are some songs here that I really like, and some I can do without.  For example &quot;Baby Boy&quot; is a future hit!  Then &quot;Signs&quot; just gets on my nerves.  Enough with the zodiac songs, what is up with her and Tyrese?  There is nothing here that moves me, but it has a good cd to vibe to.  &quot;Be With You&quot; is a really nice jam and that is all I can really say about the cd.
B000093BDX|1.0|Please God, make &quot;Kokomo&quot; go away...
038572179X|4.0|Atonement is a delicious tale of the mind of a young girl in the 1930's. <br />Through her window, her older sister Cecilia, and family friend Robbie are standing by the garden fountain until Cecila strips of her clothes and disappears in.<br />What this young girl sees, and the incidents that follow, make for a compelling read that made me do little else until I had devoured every last word.<br />A delightfully intruiging tale that takes you back to the era of flawless manners where a lady never eats whilst standing and men always where coats to dinner.<br />Proof perfect that life, is not all that it seems.
B000063CMK|4.0|Though this is not quite as emotionally poignant as the enourmous 'The Perfect Element pt 1', it is a great album on it's own right. The overall sound is less cinematic and grandeose compared to TPE1, the guitar sound is more prominent and the general atmosphere is less tragic. Still, Remedy Lane comes out being veyr dark and somber, and it mantains for the most part the same style as the last album (which is a good thing).<br />The music is also more diverse than before, and at times gets close to the proggressive heaviness of 'One Hour by the Concrete Lake'. Special mention deserve the brilliant 'Fandango', the immense 'A trace of Blood', 'Rope Ends' and the fantastic epic closer. The album is packet with punch and emotion, the chopps are never overly pretentious and sound adequate. It is really good that these guys don´t fall in the ridiculous exhibitionism of most progressive bands, as most solos are well executed, emotionally packed and technicaly impressive. The vocals are, regardless of what some people equivocally believe, rock solid, with a wide exploration of styles that add to the depth of the album. Add to that a very touching story and high quality lyrical work and the disc comes out as an impressive affair.<br />It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the musical theatrics of bands such as Dream Theater, with their billion notes a second. Time has taught me that, however, a more minimalistic apporach in music is sometimes favorable to the note-excess that far too many bands tend to abuse in their music. Remedy Lane offers a juggernaut of emotion, technical pyrotecnics and a solid story without over doing it. You don't have to play 10,000 notes at 10,000 different time signatures for 10,000 seconds to make your point.<br />As much as I like this album, it is not without it's share of flaws. Some parts come far too familiar to what was heard on TPE. Moreover, it does seem to lack the overall emotional effect of TPE. Nonetheless, 'Remedy Lane' is a safe step for the band. They have effectively produced another excellent album in their already impressive historial, and it certainly helps them bear the flag of a new generation of mature, intelligent and richly heartfelt proggressive music.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is an extraordinary story with an extraordinary message. I recommend it to anyone in search of a wholesome novel. Not only is it the tale of a boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive at sea, but it is also a story with a deeper, and very spiritual message. It is a book to make you think -- to think about life, about God, about morality. While this is indeed a story of survival on the surface, Martel instills a latent message -- one in which a boy seeks to find the ability to believe in God. To truly understand and appreciate this novel requires a deep and thought-filled insight into one's spirituality. While this may be challenging at times, it is truly a refreshing and fulfilling experience. Finishing the last chapter is a rewarding event, one which sheds new light on a subject that is, perhaps, dimly lit -- one's own faith. Life of Pi is a parable for the modern world, filled with inspirational metaphors, a yearning for understanding, and some powerful reasons to believe in God.
B000002GYR|4.0|From the gentle piano musings which open &quot;Ol '55&quot;, to the 'exit stage left' ambience which closes the title track, this album is a bittersweet nightcap for shattered souls of loneliness and heartbreak. Waits is a stylized genius of songcraft whose music evokes the vibe of late night smoke-filled urban saloons and cafes. The discordance and rasp of his vocal style only serve to augment the sadness and despair which underlie these lyrically detailed elegies. &quot;Martha&quot;, with it's deeply moving melody and emotional strings is an unforgettable highlight. If Tom Waits is an artist you've heard of and wondered about, this is the place to start.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard this CD from my friend on our way New York I couldn't put it down.  I had to listen to it during the whole trip.  This is truly a great CD and I reccomend it anybody.
0151008116|2.0|I found this tale extremely well written but also very boring and gruesome.  I almost 'gave up the ship' and ditched this book several times but plodded thru-I was not rewarded for my efforts.

B000002UB3|4.0|&quot;Come Together&quot; Contrary to what very many reviewers say, this is not a nonsense song. And it hardly should have been considered so given its melody/mood - let's get real folks! If you can't understand the lyrics here, you certainly ought to steer clear of Bob Dylan, and/or any other singer-songwriter who impels you to bask in the light of seamless and/or surreal metaphor. Lennon serially hangs attribute after attribute upon the image of a man, strange indeed, but the image gains in power and mystery with each added appendage. This image is what 'comes together' - get it? I sincerely hope so. In a way this song title outlines the plan for the album as a whole - whether or not it works depends much upon the ingenuity of the listener. Lennon was very fascinated by, and fond of these types of word/mind games. When I saw Yoko's traveling art exhibit of Lennon's works 7-8 years ago, there were several that were like lists of word riddles - exceedingly clever and thought provoking. My friend Lon and a young woman who'd ambled up were busy deciphering one set, wholly amazed, when an arrogant young man breezed by and made some trite comment about 'nonsense' or some such thing. You get the point. Some Beatles appreciators and detractors are of the plain air-headed type.<br />&quot;Something&quot;. As good a love song as ever was, compares favorably to the best of former pop crusaders like Bing Crosby and Sinatra. Beautifully conceived/written, arranged, played, and sung/crooned.<br /><br />&quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; Another song in the guise of nonsense, but again, 'separates the men from the boys'. Come on folks, what's the real message here, and how is it so imaginatively worked out? Of what is this story a metaphor?<br />&quot;Oh! Darling&quot; OK, this one sounds like filler - even though it takes us back to the memory of certain things from the White Album, musically and lyrically it's not nearly as interesting. It's likely the Beatles were offering this in a satirical vein, otherwise the song is just breaking wind.<br />&quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; Reminiscing back to the days of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; - an excellent kids song. But the evocation of dream imagery isn't so stunning as were some of their earlier offerings, nor of the multidimensional tour de force of the Rolling Stones' 'Their Satanic Majesties Request'. Kind of lightweight.<br /><br />&quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; John gets heavy. Not much in the way of lyrics; the melodies are repetitious and uninventive, the transitions between its sections are uninteresting. Feel and overall sound are pretty good, but not enough to justify its existence if you ask me. And I'm not alone here*.<br />[Side Two]<br />&quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; Through both words and melody/harmony, George invokes positivity along with pathos and compassion, via the image of the sun emerging from . . . Continues in the tradition of earlier Beatle songs like &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and &quot;The Word&quot;. There's plentiful acreage of feeling and skillful writing/playing here.<br />&quot;Because&quot; More nature imagery - this one lends toward allowing the listener to really soar in different directions emotionally. An altogether brilliant effort, though possibly a bit too short. Beatle-Us-Interruptus.<br />&quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; Back to the White Album World of &quot;Ob-La-Di&quot; and all points west, including destinations such as Pepper Land. Close your eyes for an instant (don't blink) and you might find yourself there.<br /><br />&quot;Sun King&quot; Musically evocative to the nth degree, with a minimum of means to achieve it.

B000002MTU|4.0|Ok, this is lo-o-o-ng overdue (almost 9 years).  First of all, Clapton never claimed that he was up there with the blues greats nor tries to.  Clapton is in a class by himself.  The tracks he cut are his personal favorites and I can tell that he poured his heart and soul into every one of them.  Clapton never tried to alter the way the songs were supposed to be heard.  Listening to the CD numerous times, it grew on me. Personally, I think Clapton is better at the guitar than Elmore James and yes, even Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and other blues greats.  This CD is a classic.  Clapton should have another blues CD made in a similiar fashion as this one.  Maybe he should call it &quot;Deeper Into The Cradle.&quot;
B00005JLRT|2.0|Not if it's Star Trek! Think of the revered STTNG episodes: &quot;Inner Light&quot;, &quot;Offspring&quot;, &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot;, &quot;All Good Things&quot; and many others. When was the action top priority? Never! ST has always been about issues and ideas, about intrigue, interaction between characters and humor. Action always had a supporting role and &quot;only&quot; a supporting role in our beloved ST universe. That was the case even with the most action packed and most successful TNG movie &quot;First Contact&quot;.<br />Apparently after somewhat negative reaction to &quot;Insurrection&quot; TNG producers decided otherwise. They brought in a director who puts action forward. It didn't matter Mr. Baird knew nothing about Star Trek! I don't blame him; after all he directed a couple of mindless action flicks and he is an accomplished director in his own league. Unfortunately Star Trek is NOT his league.<br />I won't go into detail since the story is known by everyone, but the basic premise of Nemesis is workable. Give it to a director who knows Star Trek and it could be made into a wonderful movie (remember Jonathan Frakes anyone?). The question &quot;what makes us US?&quot; is intriguing, the opportunity of a personality clash between Picard and Shinzon is promising. But since the producers and the director decided that this is going to be an action movie, these issues are touched lightly leaving screen time to space battles, laser-gun fights and explosions. The result is a mindless, second class, Terminator-wanna-be action flick. Even the space battles (which are visually stunning I admit) becomes boring after a while.<br />The problems don't stop there. The screenplay is written by an Oscar winner who proudly claims he's a fan! What kind of a fan can omit the wonderful interaction between the characters? Has anybody seen Beverly Crusher in the movie? Can't Geordie do any better than being a bland sidekick to Data?Where is Worf for God's sake? Oh, the writer had a personal &quot;crush&quot; to Troi so he wrote a special part for her! That special part turned out to be an insecure, violated woman with a crying face and reddish eyes! That's Deanna Troi we're talking about... Come on...<br />And the ending; which is supposed to shake the audience! What a bland scene was that!! If you're going to do that, you'll have to do it spectacular; nothing less!<br />Don't let me start counting other minor(?) issues. How can the noble and mighty Romulan Empire allow themselves to be ruled by a Reman raised Human teenager? The assasination and coup d'etat in the opening is plainly stupid! Imagine Bin Laden somehow bombs the US senate and rest of the Americans think &quot;Oh; so we're now being ruled by Bin Laden?. Erm.. Ok!&quot;... No resistance, no nothing... Get a life!<br />And one final word to fans-alike, who criticized Jonathan Frakes for Insurrection. He did a great job with &quot;First Contact&quot;, however Insurrection was definitinely not the best Trek movie ever made, but it was obvious that Mr. Frakes created a watchable movie out of an uninspiring story. He was loyal to Roddenbery's ideas and Insurrection was full of character interaction, humanism, and humor. Granted it was little more than a good two-part episode, but hey, I love TNG episodes! As a result, Mr. Frakes had to step down from the director's chair, and we'll never know what would he achieve with Nemesis. But I'd bet everything I have that it would be much better than Baird's Nemesis.<br />This is supposedly the last TNG movie and I'm sad! Not because it is the last, but because it had to farewell to all of is on such a low low note.
B000003S0Z|5.0|In this, which I believe to be his seminal vocal work, we are treated to searingly intelligent lyrical manipulation and groovy, catchy, but still mysteriously progressive instrumentation.  &quot;Backwater&quot; recalls some of the lyrical style of Here Come The Warm Jets, but has an electric piano driven bass line that still hits you even after 25 years.  I grew up listening to everything from Eno to Cream to the Clash and back again, and this album is easily in the top ten for me.  Eno uses the foreshadowing of the album title in very subtle ways throughout the work, allowing you to relax and enjoy or stare avidly at the album cover as you seek to discover all the marvelous nuances in the music, even down to track order.  Remember this was released BEFORE CD's, so it was an album, with a front and back side to it.  That simple knowledge alone enhances the experience.  If you don't have the whole album, and just downloaded a few songs, you can't truly appeciate it as the stylized work of art that it truly is.  Better yet, purchase the LP and play it on your tube amp system for that wonderfully warm sound from the &quot;Days before Digital&quot;!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears has made it clear that she is \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" with her third album, simply titled 'Britney'. Spears has matured into a songwriter, and co-producer, along with the Neptunes, (famous for work with rock artists). The third album is said to be the 'coming of age album' for an entertainer, and Spears proves that. She demonstrates stronger, less juvenile vocals, and a more urban beat. The beat has a hip-hop and techno aura about it, and more honest lyrics. She shows she has staying power through re-inventing herself, (a certain Madonna-esque), and moving on to a nineteen-year-old image, and even lower low-riders. Britney has an ... attidude, and is definitely catchy. During the duration of the album, you will snap, stomp, belt, reminisce, laugh, shake and jerk your head (to the side), and shake your bonbon until it hurts. Uptempo groove-thang of an album, with a light-heartedness, that proves, GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN!
0553582445|4.0|Fitz must rejoin the world of politics, and as before, sorrow awaits him.<br />I was up until 2 AM reading this book and cried through a good portion of it. That's a strong recommendation.<br />This is much tighter and faster-moving than the previous books in the series (and it is very much in the series; it wouldn't stand alone well), with a lot happening, definitely a page-turner. Like the others, it's character-driven, and Hobb has an excellent grasp of personality. I particularly like the Fool -- and 1/2 way through the NEXT book I STILL don't know the answer to the big question, and actually I'm getting a bit tired of the mystery, but in this volume the tension between the Fool and Fitz works wonderfully.<br />Whereas the Old Blood seemed a bit extraneous before, it's central here, and I was glad to find that characters who looked like simple villains at first become more complex. There are some holes in the plot, but nothing fatal. <br />I think this will really appeal to readers who like decidedly emotional, character-driven fantasy with decent sentence-level writing and an interesting but easily understood world. Hobb has the vital talent of putting her characters through hell down pat. It isn't a series for fans of &quot;idea stories&quot;, I don't think -- I don't mean that it doesn't have ideas but that it's almost completely character-driven. It is good solid fantasy and at its best transcends that.
0780622553|4.0|Before the Matrix, before the Crow before any of that there was 'Dark City.' A movie so good people had to find it on DVD because no one saw it at the theatre. If you like 'Matrix' then this will be a movie you treasure because it is the first, the true one.<BR>  This movie is so fantastic. It's creepy and makes you think. <BR>  The ending is a little disappointing I have to say but everything leading up to is sorely original and as a concept brilliant. <BR>   All of the actors are great. Rufus Sewell plays wide-eyed and strong with ease. Kiefer may be a little weak in his role but once the movie gets going you understand why. And Jennifer Connelly well what hasn't been said about this brilliant and underused actress. Whatever you heard apply it here.<BR>   There is an hidden conceptual art video on as an easter egg on this disc pretty trippy.  The extras as a whole are pretty good the commentary from Roger Ebert is odd but as a movie enthusiast he adds a lot of intellect to a movie chockful. The director and writer have a seperate commentary that is engaging and informative.<BR>   Adding this to your collection will make you look cool. Trust me.
0553801511|3.0|Fitz and his allies must contend with increasing political complexities, as well as challenges to their loyalty to one another.<br />I was disappointed with this book in comparison to the one before it, which I really loved. It felt as if there wasn't really enough plot here for a whole novel (at least at this wordcount) and a lot of padding in the form of expository introspection had been added in.<br />Something was strange about the way characters interacted: a tense, emotional scene would be followed by a mutual backing off, especially toward the end of the book where Lord Golden nearly vanishes from the scene. There's a realistic quality to that, but the characters never seemed to really resolve anything between themselves in any of these scenes, and I became frustrated with the &quot;one step forward, two steps back&quot; effect.<br />While in the first volume I loved the mystery about the Fool/Golden's gender and the romantic tension between him and Fitz, by the end of this volume I was ready to have the truth already. I'm going to be disappointed if he turns out to be a woman (it would be too obvious; I'm rooting for androgynous) but either way, I'm ready to know. The repeated almost-but-not-quite scenes have given the mystery almost a boy who cried wolf feeling for me. <br />Despite all this, I did enjoy the book. The events that did take place were exciting, Hobb maintains her good grasp of personality, and I like the emotional, character-driven nature of the story. I think the transitional plot here, since it's the second in a trilogy, created some difficulties for the author, but we do get important information. I'm looking forward to the third installment, and I optimistically expect it will be tighter and faster-moving.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Many times actors have early success then find themselves either without work or in stagnant drivel. Matt Damon, let's be honest, was sinking fast. This movie, saved him.  <BR>  His portrayal is honest and the action is true, not just spectacle.  This movie is intense and yet because of Famke Potent romantic and mysterious. <BR>  The extras on this DVD are great and many will like it but the one thing that I loved are the deleted scenes. The alternate ending was probably the best ending they had but because of Hollywood politics, especially with the potential franchise of this movie, it was too romantic and intense for any sequel to go on.<BR>   This movie was a success at the theatres but many don't think of it as a Matt Damon movie, but aside from making another 'Goodwill Hunting' this is the Matt Damon we will come to know.
0385504209|5.0|I started reading this while killing an hour before going to a Fourth of July BBQ.  Well, an hour later I could not put it down... missed the BBQ, fireworks, and my beauty sleep as I stayed up until 4 AM when I finished this marvelous tale.  I immediately picked up Dan Brown's &quot;prequel&quot; of sorts, Angels and Demons, and spent the next day reading that.  Dan Brown has put a huge dent in my social life this last weekend but it was worth it all.  I want to marry Robert Langdon.  Can't wait for the next book!
B00000K3D4|4.0|As a child this movie ruled my life.<BR>    As an adult I can see why.<BR>    Everything about this movie is magical. The sets are amazing, the songs are catchy and funny, the characters fantastical. <BR>    Also as an adult I can see the strings and all that especially with a crystal clear picture on this DVD.  But this DVD has so many great extras even hearing a young Jennifer Connelly talk about her future after this whether she will stay an actress or become a carpenter is funny. The behind-the-scenes stuff goes in depth about the execution of the puppets and the amount of energy and skill needed to make these inanimate or otherwise nonexistant creatures come to life, and interact with living people seamlessly.<BR>   With all the hype of computer generation and animation of the like this handmade classic still holds up after all these years.
B000001F5F|5.0|This Album marked a very important period, when they conquered the US for the first time.  It is a unbelievable example of them breaking out and claiming their title.  Up until then, they had modest success.  I remember taking the train into NYC to buy their Imports of October and Boy at Bleaker Bobs.  This recording shows their raw and young talents.  Party Girl is worth the cost of the whole CD. A must have for any collection. GO buy this!!!!
B000066AXE|5.0|You know how you watch a David Lynch movie and it pulls a twist on you and you are hooked then it ends?  All of that investment washed away you know that feeling?<BR>   Ron Howard doesn't. He knows the need for a payoff and he delivers.  This movie knocked me out. <BR>   Russell Crowe brilliant. Jennifer Connelly brilliant. Everyone involved gave their best and all were rewarded for it both in box office and awards.<BR>    The awards edition DVD has great extras. Behind the scenes of the movie as well as the casting. The Oscar acceptance speeches. The make-up and effects involved. By the way there is more CGI in this movie than one would expect and it's all unnoticable. No gratuitous CGI for ROn.<BR>     The only weak parts are the commentaries both writer Akiva Goldman and Ron Howard get seperate tracks and it would have been nice to have them bounce off of one another. That said I also have to say that each give a great perspective on the scenes and actors involved because each had a different and notable experience. <BR>     This is great for any collection and certainly a great movie all around.
B0000041WM|4.0|I am not one who likes to coment on others reviews, however in this case I will make an exception. The person who gave this recording a single star obviously has not heard some of the dereadful recordings of Rigoletto out there.<br />The cast in this recording is simply top notch, though they are not all in top form. Pavarotti's voice is not at its best here however he still delivers a solid performance as the playfull and arrogant duke. If you would like to hear Pavarotti at his best get the Southerland set. For his part Nucci start strong though his voice seems to loose power and passion twards the latter part of act two and into act three. Ghiaurov is brilliant despite his age here. His voice as always is concentrated and strong. He is truly one of the greates.<br />The absolute star of this recording however is Anderson. Her voice is strong yet fragile when need be. She brings Gilda to life here in a way that few have done before. Her performance is head and sholders above that of  Southerland.Further her timing with Nucci in their duet in act one is brilliant. They work to bring out the best in one another rather then drawn each other out as is so often the case.<br />Over all this is a very good recording of Rigoletto, and one could do much worse with other recordings currentlly available.
B00000IBRI|4.0|This movie is crazy. It is weird. It is an acid trip through the Italian country, with Jennifer Connelly in the middle of it.<br />  Wow. I watched this late one night thinking that I was getting something different and I was not disappointed. Argento is known for his gross out horror and he goes full out with this one. The music is heavy metal and the visuals beautiful such a combination is pretty interesting especially once the killing begins.<br />  The extras on this are very informative and just as off the wall as the movie.  For the money you spend on this you almost feel like you are making an investment in art.  It will get better and more valuable with time, trust me, they don't make'em like this anymore.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Arnold is a favorite target of jokes now that he's older and has slipped, but he had quite a run, whether you begin the count with Conan or with Terminator. He was some moneymaker. And you can't find a better hero for a sci-fi thriller. Who else has those eyes, or that gaptooth or that accent?<br />I consider the original Terminator to be slightly better than the sequel T2, which no doubt gets added help from its ground breaking, and still astonishing special visual effects. (Come to think about it, how far has ILM gone after Robert Patrick's T-1000 in \\"Terminator 2\\"? Not very far. You have Mystique from X-Men and that clunky CGI Hulk. Even Mystique is just a revision of T-1000.) Terminator gets my nod for the original story, which not only changed the way we average folks view reality (a phenomenon that must have inspired a few grins from physicists who understood Einstein), but also inspired such movies as \\"Back to the Future\\" and \\"Matrix\\". <br />What else do I like about Terminator? Like all those classic surprise hits, it wasn't made to actually become a classic, with its creators expecting little out of it. You know, like Casablanca, the first Star Wars, Blair Witch and Funny Cide (the horse).<br />I also like Terminator because Arnold was a villain, and he had always been better as a villain, whether as himself in \\"Pumping Iron\\" or as Mr. Freeze in \\"Batman and Robin\\". Or as the Terminator.<br />There's something almost supernatural about the scare factor of this cyborg. It's simple, brutal logic (I don't know how Sarah Connor looks like, so why not simply knock off everyone named Sarah Connor?). Its very concept, a robotic assassin that passes itself off as regular guy, is scary. In Kyle Reese's flashback, when an unnamed terminator penetrates the humans' lair and wreaks such havoc Reese loses Sarah Connor's picture, there was the fleeting moment where Reese sees the terminator through the flames, its red eyes flashing, almost something out of a horror movie,a vampire or a werewolf, a ruthless, unstoppable monster. And of course, those naked terminators, shorn of their human skin, prowl like an army of skeletons, eyes in their sockets relentlessly seeking human prey. We've always been fascinated by things that could eat us (\\"Jaws\\", lions, crocodiles, vampire movies). The Terminator was such a one.<br />When the police department shootout commences, you cannot help but cheer for the Terminator, at the back of your mind perhaps those glorious Westerns that had the hero fighting a whole gang of evil gunfighters singlehanded, or Toshiro Mifune in \\"Yojimbo\\" facing similar odds. You cheer, but it's the bad guy you're rooting for. This guy was cool.<br />But the best thing I like about Terminator is it doesn't apologize. Nor does it pretend. Compared to the sequel, which drowned in the young John Connor's (Edward Furlong) brimming political correctness, the original Terminator movie was a shin breaker. It doesn't just rock, it's a rock.
6305263248|4.0|This is a gritty, cold war drama without the cold war. The old pro at this sort of thing, John Frankenheimer, does it up right with this extremely well done film. This is the world of men with guns and cars, and Frankenheimer really excels at portraying this dangerous culture that exists right beneath the one you and I live in. The plot is perfect: There exists a case that everyone must have: the French, the Russians, and the IRA. The Irish put together a team of highly trained, out-of-work and somewhat tainted international professionals (thus the title of the film) to get it. Simple as that. Everyone chases the case, killing and double crossing all the way. This is a movie filled with men creeping in and out of shadows, walking like small swat teams through crowds of normal people, and coming together often in very realistic gun battles. In other words, just what the doctor ordered after your girlfriend sweet talks you into watching Titanic or some Merchant Ivory snooze fest one more goddamn time.<br />The DVD insert explains how Frankenheimer went to great lengths to assure realism in this movie, and it shows. Everything is stark and nearly sepia colored, the streets of Paris (where the movie begins) resemble an open, dripping sewer. Also, the car chase scene is an actual tire-squealing, engine-overdriving, steel crunching car chase  without digital help or ridiculous comic book stunts. Just high-performance cars tearing through the streets with muscular precision. This car chase will probably be remembered in the same class as the classic car romp in Bullett (though I have to say, I still prefer Steve McQueen behind the wheel of that extremely buffed GT Mustang).<br />The tone is real, and the cast is well chosen: De Niro, of course, is always the seasoned pro, just like the character, Sam, he plays in the film. The scene where he calls out Spence (Sean Bean) is a whole lot of fun. Spence is a one of the professionals contracted for the job, and he and Sam dont get along from the get-go. You see it coming from the beginning, and when it comes it doesnt disappoint. Jonathan Pryce is a scary surprise as the nearly demented, lethal IRA rouge, Seamus; and Jean Reno (Vincent) is so completely word-weary and French, you sense that after he killed you he would feel very sad about it.<br />Im not sure why, but this movie really improves with second or third viewings. Perhaps it is the statuesque, ice-melting presence of Katarina Witt, who has a small but important part in the film as a, well, statuesque, ice-melting Russian figure skater. Talk about perfect casting!nd he and Sam dont get along from the get-go. You see it coming from the beginning, and when it comes it doesnt disappoint.

B00005JM09|4.0|The first thing you're likely to think as the movie starts is, \\"this sure doesn't feel like a Terminator movie.\\" And I attribute this mostly the absolutely horrible soundtrack. Brad Fiedel's famous and haunting score of man vs machine is no where to be found. Beltrami does an arrangement of it once...at the end credits. Now I realize that most movie-goers care less about musical scores, but the absense of Fiedel is as strong as if you were going to make a Star Wars sequel and not use John Williams classic score.<br />If your a real fan of the franchise, the second thing you'll notice is a true lack of James Cameron. I must admit, that many of the shots and the cinematography appears right out of the T2 playbook, but it's important to remember Cameron didn't only direct the film, he wrote it. T3 suffers from a real lack of intelligent plotting that is one of Cameron's strongpoints. For the most part, action scene happen because... well they just needed action scenes.<br />The story centers around a now adult John Conner, aimlessly making his way through life now that Judgement Day has successfully been avoided (see T2). But we find out of course that it hasn't, it's just been prolonged 10 years. In this film, Skynet is about to go operational and machines are about to take over the world just as Reese described in T1. But the target isn't only Conner this time. New character Kate Brewster is John's future second in command, and it's she who this time sends back the antiquated T-800 to protect both her and John. The new menace is the T-X which is even more advanced (and somehow less advanced) then the T-1000 from T2.<br />The plot is pretty formulaic, and follows the traditional Terminator style. There's definately nothing cerebral about it, and you know pretty quickly into the film just how the T-X is gonna bite it thanks to some pretty obvious forshadowing. Most of it is just an excuse to have Arnold kicking [butt] against the virtually indestructable T-X that should have destroyed him in the first 15-minutes (she's an anti-terminator terminator). At least in this film, Arnold's Terminator is much more a killing machine than the \\"now I know why you cry\\" touchy-feely Terminator from T2.<br />Despite all the flaws that are glaring once you stop and think about this film when it's over, it's still hard not to enjoy it. On it's own, it's a pretty fun hollywood blockbuster. As a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi franchises of all time, it's lacking. But fortunately, it's good enough that you're glad to have it rather than no sequel at all. I particularly enjoyed the ending. While not executed as well as it could have been, it brings a lot more meaning to the story rather than just the same old, \\"how they gonna defeat the terminator this time?\\" type of plot. It leaves a huge opening for a sequel, but also serves as a fitting ending to the series, should this be it.<br />All in all, I have to give T3 a positive review. Even though the James Cameron fan in me questions much of this film, it's still entertaining, and that's all this film sets out to do. It's a fun roller coaster ride that shouldn't be missed in the theatre if you at all enjoy big action blockbusters.ould have destroyed him in the first 15-minutes (she's an anti-terminator terminator).

0767812646|5.0|This is a all time favortie movie. It's great and the songs touch your heart!
B00005J6T1|3.0|unless you want the original version of Holiday, Borderline and Lucky Star which the Immaculate Collection does not have, then get this one, otherwise dont bother, the edited version in Immaculate collection are good enough!<BR>the original versions on this album are too long, (up to 5 and 6 minutes,  you'll get sick of listening to repetitve lyrics and beats....)<BR>though, this album has  forgotten hits like Everybody and Burning Up, they are very good too<BR>I wouldn't spend money on this one, just get the mp3 of those songs, if you are a fan, and want to collect madonna's CDs, start from True Blue, the real Madonna begins from there!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|I just bought this cd recently and was in awe by it. There is not one bad song on it. It gets you right from the start with the awesome \\"Politik\\". My favorite song on it is \\"Clocks\\". This is by far one of the best albums I've ever heard. Trust me, this is a must have cd. It will not let you down. Go out and buy Coldplay!
B000002LLC|5.0|Well, Madonna voice is not so great, I agree, but managing to sing those songs on this album is not easy, but she did it very well, sounds very professional like she's a true jazzy artist!<BR>those songs are Big Band, Broadway style ...<br />-Sooner Or Later [ a jazzy romatic ballad]<BR>-Hanky Panky [a fun boogie ]<BR>-I'm Going Bananas [a funny salsa style song]<BR>-Something To Remember [the best ballad on the CD, never sounds outdated,thats why it was choosen for 1995 Something to Remember]<BR>-More [simply the best track (excluding Vogue) among these jazzy songs, Madonna voice on this song is surprisingly good, very accurate tone, and strong]<br />This is definitely not a pop Album, for those who love pop music, you wont be aprrieciating this one as much As I do. you would probably think \\"Vogue\\" is the only good track. But for me, for people who like jazz music, and love Madonna too. I Think its nice to have a jazzy album of your idol,...dont you think???<BR>-
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I read this book, and loved it. Persuasion was the first book I read from Jane Austen, so after I finished it, I just had to watch the movie. We rented the movie, and right as I turned it on, I knew that it was not going to be what I had exspected. The movie had poor actors, they made the characters in the book look as if they were just to old to live, and love. Among othere things, it left out many scene that are vital to the book. <br />  I watched this with my mother, and I was the only one who read the book. As the movie went on, she had to stop it to ask me what was going on.  The beginning of the movie, in my opinion, is the worst part because they leave out that she was once in love with a man when they were younger. It confuses you through out the rest of the movie, which I can say is very long and boring. The romance in this movie is lost. In the book you can read what love she is thinking and feeling, but in the movie they try and show it, although it is shown very poorly. <br />  I highly recomend that a person should read the book before watching this sad excuse of a movie. And if you have already watched this movie, please, PLEASE, do not let it ruin your respect for Jane Austen's writings. Again I will say that the book is 1000 times better than this movie, and I hope that some day, another producer will try to clean up the mess that this movie has made, and produce a better vershion of persuasion.
B00005J6SZ|3.0|Every artist has a follow up album to their first debut!<BR>And this is Madonna one! despite it has two of her signature songs Like A Virgin and Material Girl, I still don't find this is a good album<br />The singles and videos released off this album are&quot;<br />Like A Virgin<BR>Material Girl<BR>Dress You UP<br />Well, that's just the start of Madonna, what can you say? except the singles, the rest of the album are just okay, nothing remarkable. its because, the accompaniment of music back then was not so good, this album sounds very outdated<BR>if you have the Immaculate Collection, it has the better version of Like a Virgin and Material Girl already, dont bother getting this one.
B0000025D0|5.0|As a teenager growing up in the late 1970's I was witness to some of the greatest music of all time - not necessailly the top 40 stuff, but albusm like Hearts of Stone by Southside Johnny, Who are You by The Who, You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic by Ian Hunter, Blood on the Tracks by Bob Dylan and This Years Model by Elvis Costello.  I love all of these albums, but as great as they are none of them seem to fulfill all of the elements of greatness the way Darkness has.  The emotion shown in this album has never been duplicated in my opinion.  The terrible fight surrounding the release, and the triumphant response from the die hard fans cast Bruce as a legend - a role that he has successfully maintained for the last 25 years.  The only dissapointment with this album is the tracks that did not make it - Because the Night which he gave to Patty Smith during the recording sessions - and tracks which later surfaced on The River - Point Blank, The Ties that Bind and Independence Day.  Not to mention the contravercial song The Promise - which was cut because of it's obvious connection to Bruce's legal problems relating to the release.  In the past 25 years Darkenss has been the yardstick for measuring all new releases and I can't think of many that have come close.  There have been some great albums since Darkness - August and Everything After by the Counting Crows, 1992 by the Wallflowers - Cracked Rear View by Hootie and the Blowfish and White Ladder by David Gray - but I still beleive Darkness is number one.  And just when you thought there was nothing left in the tank for Bruce, he released The Rising which was easilly the best release of 2002 - reliving as a third party the devastating events of September 11.  The intensity and heartfelt emotion are stong enough to send shivers down the spines of any listener.  The road has not always been an easy one for Bruce, but each release has been important in it's own way, and if I could own only one cd - it would be Darkness on the Edge of Town - <BR>Dave MacDonald
B000002MUW|5.0|I Love Madonna because her every album has it own taste and style, her music is always changing and creative, this album is also a masterpiece of her. The sound in here is R&B, a little hip hop (I'd rather be your lover), and Ballad<BR>Every songs in here sounds good, I love all except Bedtime Story (because I dont like Bjork music)<BR>Best tracks are: Secret, Take a Bow,Human Nature, Inside Of Me, Love Tried To WelCome me, Forbidden Love, Don't Stop<BR>If you are collecting Madonna's album, this one is a must have,<BR>don't rely on GHV2 to have the singles from this album, because the \\"Human Nature\\" on GHV2 sucks, it cuts out the main line lyric, so get this, to feel the soft, R&B side of Madonna
B00006J3WH|5.0|Everyone else seems to rate it high so why shouldn't I? Honestly though, like most of these reviewers I'm a hardcore Buffy fan and this soundtrack is not to be missed! This episode, with the singing *reminded me of Cop Rock* could have been doomed from the start, but it turned out to be a very entertaining hour and some odd minutes of TV. The songs were well written and *you couldn't expect less from Joss could you?* the songs STICK in your head! I remember shortly after this episode aired I was humming these songs and singing them at work, and it drove me crazy! I supose 'crazy' in a good way though.<BR><BR>Maybe these aren't songs you want to hear constantly running through your brain while doing work you hate but, while you are just sitting around at home they are a lot of fun.<BR>Anyway, there are a lot of extras with this. The demo with Joss & his wife was a great thing to throw in. <BR>The cast itself can sing just fine also...with the exception of poor Willow. <BR><br />Spike/Giles/Tara/Anya all shine on this soundtrack/episode.<BR>This is truly something that no Buffy fan can be without. With the show being over and everything it's a great thing to hang onto. Us hardcore Buffy freaks need something don't we?
B000002NAK|5.0|If Madonna released this as her studio album (only has songs performed by her), this would have been a huge sucess, she has enough songs to do it:<br /> Dont Cry For Me Argentina<BR> You Must Love Me<BR> Another Suitcase In Another Hall<BR> Benous Aires<BR> ...<br />and If only \\"You Must Love Me\\" could be the Video Version,that would be perfect!!!<BR>Madonna's voice at the best!!!
B000003S5H|4.0|I have to admit I was drawn in by \\"Sexy Boy\\", then found out that the rest was just as good, but mellower, smoother. I love the opening track. That sets the mood perfectly for the album. I also like the female singing, and the vocal effects on a number of the tracks. Of all the electronica I own, I can't think of anything like it, other than maybe a spacier \\"Daft Punk\\", (also french). Overall this is one of my favorites, and really is a breath of fresh \\"Air\\".
B000002N3J|5.0|Despite Madonna is famous for dance, uptempo songs, this is her soft side which is really good too. All the songs is here are all serious music (not like those \\"making money song\\"), the ballad flows from the past up to the present time (1995),they are all amazing, of course I love all the songs on it! Singles and Video released off this album are;<br />I Want You (video only)<BR>You'll See <BR>Love Don't Live Here Anymore (remix)<BR>One More Chance<br />Those are the new material to this album, also the terrific soundtracks \\"I'll Remember\\" and \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" finally are iincluded in Madonna's album<BR>So you can consider this is a studio album too, because 6 tracks (half of the album) are the new materials you don't have in her previous albums, definitely worth buying!!!<br />In My Opinion, <BR>You'll See (should be a radio edit version)<BR>Love Don't Live Here Anymore (should be the video version, its totally different and better than the 1984's version)<br />Well, I would highly recommended this album to go with GHV2, if you want a summary of her 90s career, or just simply buy it if you love Ballad songs (it's Madonna ballads,  different but amazing)<br />So enjoy!!!
B000001A3H|4.0|Regardless of how you classify &quot;Kyuss&quot;, one thing is for sure, they just simply rock. You can tell these guys just want to drop some quality riffs, and have a good time doing it. As I listen to the music, I can see the Budweiser sitting on the amp. I guess I look at these guys as being the pioneers of the &quot;stoner-rock&quot; movement, like &quot;Korn&quot; was to the &quot;nu-metal&quot; one. Two of these guys went on to form &quot;Queen's of the Stoneage&quot; which also rock. It's not too hard to hear who they have influenced, just as you might guess they're fans of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; or early &quot;Soundgarden&quot;. If you don't check out &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot;, you may like &quot;...And the Circus Leaves Town&quot;. That's just as sweet, but not quite as raw. So order this disc, play the song &quot;Freedom Run&quot;, light up a smoke, and get out your air-guitar.
B000002MFN|5.0|I love all the 90s album of Madonna, and this one is not an exception, There are honestly only 2 real sex songs on this CD ( Erotica , Where Life Begins), All the others are great dance and pop tune ( wat were the critics talking about?)<BR>Singles and Videos released Off this album are:<BR> <BR>Erotica<BR>Deeper And Deeper<BR>Bad Girl<BR>Fever<BR>Rain<br />Songs like Deeper And Deeper, Rain, Bad girl, Where Life Begins, Waiting have such great pop tune, and are my favorite too. the latin guitar interlude in Deeper and Deeper, the piano jazz sound in Waiting, the sexy Saxophone in WHere Life Begins,...are enough to rate this album Excellent. Not to mention Rain, such a beautifull ballad, with diffrent new accompaniment music, Bad girl, great pop tune, strange enjoyable chords. Well, if there wasnt the Sex Book, this could be the No1 album and one her highest selling records. wat a shame!!!<br />and If \\"Fever\\" could be the video version, this album would be perfect!!!<BR>don't pay attention to critics, if you are a real Madonna fans, get all of her 90s albums (Erotica, Bedtims Story, Something to Remember, Ray Of Light, Music)<BR>Get this, and listen! You will see why it is so underated back then!!!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I am a sucker for this movie, since it is amied for children.  However it is good, I liked the magic in it all.  I love the fiction about it and it was something that I would want to see any other movies that are made.  I have the first one which was so good, I had to get the second one.
B000002LCD|2.0|It has only 4 songs of Madonna, and 3 of them are good<BR>yes, Who's that girl, causing a commotion are great singles, but very soon went outdated and forgotten. I guess thats why she wouldn't include them in the Immaculate Collection

B00005J6T0|5.0|After the first and &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, Madonna finally made an album of her own songs. the singles and videos released are:<br />-Live To Tell [one of her best ballad upto date]<BR>-Papa don't preach [madonna's statement about pregnant teenager, music is very good]<BR>-True Blue [a fun, enjoyable song, with catchy beat and lyrics]<BR>-Open Your Heart [A very rocky sound-song, catchy beat and lyric]<BR>-La Isla Bonita [her all time memorible latin song]<br />The rest of it like: &quot;Wheres The Party, Love Makes the world go round...&quot; are very upbeat and dancable, enjoyable<BR>overall, this is a great album of Madonna, when she starts writing music on her own. it turned out so successful<BR>Must have for collection<BR>especially &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; does not keep the original version of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; which is a shame<br />Enjoy!
B000000WA4|5.0|By itself, this album is quite brilliant at times, when compared to earlier pumpkins, it is still brilliant.  This is basically Corgan's progressive, epic, masterpiece thing.  Musically sprawling, varied, rich, and complex; lyrically it is really high quality(Corgan was always a lyrical mad genius), and the overall effect is fairly powerful.  The two discs have their own appeal, the first being more balanced and evenly spread, the second is more a disc of extremes(mellow/rock out).  The artistic appeal and introspective nature of the whole thing is still a draw to most established fans, and also more broad in its appeal to the top 40 types as well.  Ultimately I would go ahead and call this album a must have for the time period in music no matter who you are.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is the Madonna's most mature record of the 80s (since people didnt consider Madonna so serious back then)<BR>It contains the 3 great hits Like a Prayer, Express Yourself and Cherish. the music is very rocky and strong! <BR>singles and videos released off this album are\\"<br />Like A Prayer    [masterpiece of the album]<BR>Express Yourself [great girl power song, very strong song]<BR>Cherish          [midtempo, it sounds cute, sincere, memorible] <BR>Dear Jessie      [cute, lovely song]<BR>Oh Father        [one of her most personal song]<br />Madonna's voice sounds great on this album, but not as good as it is in her 90s later on.<BR>All of those songs are great, the others like : Till Death Do Us Part, Promise to try, Spanish Eyes, Keep it Together are great too. I don't like \\"Love song\\" thats the only one in this album I hate<BR>the last song \\"act of contrition\\" is not a song, its just the short outtro of the album.<BR>And remember the Like a Prayer and Express yourself in here are not the same as the \\"immaculate collection\\" version. I particularly like the Brass melody of this version of Express yourself, which is cut out in the immaculate collection version<BR>Well, for Madonna in the 80s, this album is the best, No doubt she is the queen of pop uptodate , when we look back all of her records are amazing!<br />must have for collection
B000006NPY|4.0|Adore is a hard album to explain.  Without Jimmy Chaberlain the whole thing kind of feels wrong, but Corgan's lyrics and emotions are so hard to resist.  This always struck me as being a more personal album and most of the songs favor lyrical meaning over musical substance which is kind of soothing, especially to the real Corganite types.  It is a very different pumpkins, and it is hard to recommend to a target audience, but I enjoy it almost as much as the pre-progressive stuff, and I think a lot of fans out there would too.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is no doubt a Madonna's finest record album up to date, and also is my favorite studio album. The sound is new, fresh, and very deeply impressive. every song on this album is a masterpiece, they all sound very serious, and much efforts have been put into it to create the amazing sound of them!<BR>I love all the tracks, except track 8 (cause I dont understand the language on that song) The singles and videos released off this album are: <br /> Frozen (1998)<BR> Ray of Light (1998)<BR> Drowned World/Substitute For Love (1998)<BR> The Power Of Goodbye (1998)<BR> Nothing Really Matters (1999)<br />Though I would like \\"Swim\\" to be a single or have a video too, thats such a great song (better than Nothing really matters I think)<BR>Absolutely amazing, Highly recommended!!!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Any fan of Smashing Pumpkins who does not already own this needs to own this album.  Any fan of late 80s/early 90s rock should own this album.  Most music fans in general really should at least hear it.  Siamese dream is slightly bolder than its predecessor, and therefore is a more sprawling view of the band's overall talent and Corgan's musical genius.  I could go on and on about the album's intricacies and subtleties but ultimately it is just a well arranged, well played, well written, and well produced album showing a unique take on developing form of music for its time.
B00004X01U|5.0|First time I listened to it, I was disappointed, cause \\"Music\\" has such a strange sound ,and the vocoder effect is used on couple of tracks<BR>but then later and later on, it gradually grew on me, I realized that what an amazing sound it has, it is so creative, theres nothing wrong with this<BR>The singles and videos released off this album are<br />Music (2000)<BR>Don't Tell Me (2000)<BR>What It Feels Like For A Girl (2001)<br />Though my favorites are : Don't Tell Me, Music, Paradise (not for me), Impressive instant, Runaway Lover<BR>Its not fair to compare this with \\"Ray Of Light\\", this is Madonnas return to the dancefloor, Madonna was right choosing another new producer, because William Orbit at the same time was working with other artists too, \\"Music\\" would have sounded the same as other people's records, that's boring, Madonna would difinitely not like that<BR>\\"Music\\" is a fun, upbeat album<BR>get it, you won't be disappointed!!!
B000000W6R|5.0|This is basically the last example of the pumpkins in pre-progressive form.  Many of the songs were recorded well before this album ever even existed, and truly they all have their own appeal.  This album is downshifted more from the previous two LPs, it is full of more relaxed music and poorer recording quality(at times).  One of the main appealing factors on this release is the track &quot;Blew Away&quot; written by James Iha, offering a little insight into his pontential(actally I believe he wrote another on the album as well but I'm not sure which one).  To me the other main attraction is the album's centerpiece &quot;Starla&quot; which is in my opinion is one of the last big sendoffs of early-era pumpkins.  This is a fan must-have, and recommended to all.
B00005OWEG|4.0|I am giving this movie four stars because the original, theatrical release was outstanding.  Now, call me not avant garde enough to appreciate the subtle nuances of the Redux if you want to, but I feel that the extended version detracts, instead of adds, to this masterpiece.<br />Of course, any movie with this array of stars (Brando, Sheen, Duval, Hopper, Fishburne, even smaller roles for Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn) could not be bad, no matter what form it takes.  The major weakness of this version is that it humanizes Captain Willard, making him a little more accessible to us &quot;normal&quot; folk.  What made the character so chilling in the original cut was him impartiality to the crew of the boat and to his mission.  It could have been any four guys piloting that boat, or no one, it didn't matter to him.  What the Redux has done was shatter that division between Willard and the crew, especially in the scene where he steals Kilgore's surfboard and laughs about it with the crew.  This moment of levity actually makes him appear more human, not the machine that the original movie cast him as.<br />Also, especially in light of recent events, the French lecturing any American on any aspect of conducting war turns my stomach.  I was completely happy being unaware of that part of the movie.  The French exist but for our good graces today.  Sorry to interject my political views.<br />At any rate, the original version is hard to find now, but if I can find a used copy, I will more than likely trade in Redux and go back to the shorter, better version.  But do not let this review sway anyone who has not yet seen this movie, in any form.  Redux is still better than No View.
B00008DDXC|1.0|this movie bites it has no detail like the books. jk should have helped direct it!!
6304286961|3.0|I really like the music of the Doors.  They had many fine records.   It's too bad this film doesn't live up to the same standard.  <br />One might reasonably expect a movie named &quot;The Doors&quot; to be about the band of that name and reputation.  It's not.  One might further expect such a titled film to be focused on music.  It isn't.     <br />Instead, &quot;The Doors&quot; is almost exclusively a film about Jim Morrison, singer in The Doors, and the focus is on his rather decadent lifestyle (to the extent the film is accurate).  A more appropriate title might have been \\"Morrison\\" or, \\"Jim Morrison and the Decadence.\\" <br />The film doesn't give any insight into the band, its formation, or its creative process.  Instead, with respect to the band, we get many all-too-brief scenes--often with improbable dialogue.  For example, early on, we see The Doors rehearsing, playing \\"Break on Through,\\" when, inexplicitly, John Densmore stops playing to say it's not happening for him.  So then Robbie Krieger, on cue, pulls a scrap of paper out of his pocket and says he has a song (Light My Fire).  He sings a verse.  Morrison, on first listen says, \\"These are great lyrics, do you have another verse?\\"  Another verse materializes.  The band plays less than a minute with Morrison singing. Then Ray Manzarek stops them all to say, \\"Give me five minutes, I need (to write) an intro\\"-so the band goes out to the beach.  Of course then we're treated to the recorded intro to the song.  The whole scene is rather unbelievable.  <br />Later in the film, backstage in the throes of a concert, when Morrison is obviously high, Densmore criticizes his behavior, without any sort of conversational prelude, by telling him: \\"We took drugs to expand our mind, not to escape.\\"  <br />The script could have been written by a high schooler from L.A.  The title to this review is one of the few good lines in the film.  <br />So, the film audience learns next to nothing about Krieger, Manzarek or Densmoreexcept to know them as foils to Morrison and to perhaps infer they're all pretty square-never mind that the whole band wrote many of their great songs.<br />By contrast, we learn all too much about Morrison-most of it unflattering.  Having enjoyed his music so much I might expect to find something to like about him as a person.  As portrayed, there's not much.  The film is all the time all about how bad and immature he can act.  For example, when Morrison's film at film school is criticized, he says, \\"I quit\\" and walks out.  Then he meets Pam (Meg Ryan) and tells her his parents are dead (a lie). As another reviewer here notes, Morrison is wasted throughout the movie.  We see him taking four or five acid trips and at least that many times he's drinking straight out of the bottle.  I'm amazed that someone whose apparent purpose in life was to either get wasted or get laid was able to concentrate on making good music.  <br />Val Kilmer did a good job acting, including his impression of Morrison's vocals.  As the film ends, however, you hear the real Morrison singing his incredible vocal on L.A. Woman and realize that Kilmer didn't quite get there-but then, who could? <br />There are many cameos in \\"The Doors\\" including Densmore, Kreiger, Bonnie Bramlett, Paul Rothchild, Eric Burdon, Paul Williams, William Kuntsler and Patricia Keanally. Some were evident to this viewer; some were not.  But as intriguing as they might be, I'm not anxious to watch this film again anytime soon.
0451191153|5.0|The first thing I must say about the Fountainhead is I found it utterly brilliant.  That said, I must tell future readers that it is one of the densest books I have ever read.  This is a good thing though, and anyone who likes to think should read this book (I hope those of you looking to buy this book can actually think for yourself).  The secret to the success of the Fountainhead is that it shows Howard Roark not as perfect, but as ideal in not being perfect.  He is ultimately stubborn, unemotional, but driven by the desire to create, the desire to achieve greatness for the sake of its own creation, not for the artificial enjoyment of others.<br />The Fountainhead is about the extremes of society.  Everyone can picture a man like Ellsworth Toohey, but few have actually seen one.  Howard Roark is a character that no one will comprehend, because his greatest strength is that he does not feel the need to make himself understandable.  He is what he stands for, and that is all.  Ayn Rand uses this book to champion the individual, to show that it is not the follower who achieves true success, but the creator who refuses to compromise his ideals.  He expects nothing from anyone, but still works because his work is important to him.  Ultimately, Ayn Rand is an extremist whose ideas are very controversial simply for that reason.  She does not see the other side, and believes that her ideas are correct, and that the other side is ultimately wrong because of it.  What you must understand with this book is that its extreme point of view leads to its power, but that you have to make sure and realize what it is that she is saying.  It is something that no person can accomplish, and that is why Howard Roark is a model for mankind.  No one can be Howard Roark, but we can encompass bits of his philosophy into ours.<br />This book will confuse you, torture you, but ultimately leave you feeling fulfilled and full of ideas.  That is all you can ask from it.
B000002JST|4.0|This is my favorite AC/DC album with Bon Scott as lead singer. Released in May of 1977, it has excellant, raw flavor, and the tracks are great. The slow, but catchy, \\"Go Down\\" opens the album. \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" is a good follow-up to it, with it's skipping beat. The title track is fast with a very good bass line. \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\" is good with it's delayed start-up. \\"Problem Child is a radio staple. It was originally released on the \\"DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP album in 1976, but for some unexplained reason, it was put on this album outside of Australia and Europe, in place of \\"Crabsody In Blue.\\" I can't understand why ATCO did this. \\"Crabsody In Blue\\" is nice blusey track that would make this record complete.<br />Moving on, \\"Overdose\\" is an odd track with it's slow start-up and it takes awhile to build, but the results are good. \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\" is the strongest track on the album. Angus Young rips chords with fury on this one, and this song is my favorite on the album. \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" is a rather blusey fast, number that closes the album. The duplication of \\"Problem Child\\" is why I gave this album 4 stars. If the album was released in it's original form, it would be 5.
B00004XONN|5.0|I bought this album after hearing some of Radiohead's earlier work.  I expected this record to be similar to their more successful titles like The Bends or OK Computer.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  In this album Radiohead takes a leap and challenges their fans to follow.  They challenge the sensibilities of pop music in tracks which dare to disturb their listeners from their comfortable lives.  This is something the majority of records released in the last ten years have failed to do.<br />   The real aspect of this album which sets it apart from the rest is the way the songs are presented.  Thom chooses not to tell the listener the feelings he is conveying but rather shows them, something most artists these days could take a note of.  One of the best parts of this piece of work is that you actually have to listen to the music to enjoy the album instead of just pounding your fists to a catchy beat.  It makes you think.  To me the creativeness of this album could only be compared to Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or The Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot;.  In order to understand one must play the record as all the tracks put together.  Listen and think, and even those who don't understand it at first glance will eventually catch on.
0689859368|5.0|Mysterious house one; children three; books five (hmmm); magical creatures many; mysteries to solve, yet unexplored, add all of these ingredients and mix well with two beguiling authors and you have the beginnings of a series just right for readers captivated by mystical, magical worlds. The Grace children are inquisitive, intelligent, strong-willed, resourceful and yet have a touch of the everyday child (struggling with their parents divorce and some problems at school). They live with their divorced Mom in a creaking old mansion that just happens to hold some very curiously odd creatures, hidden nooks and crannies and even more furtive magical creatures, some not so friendly. There are mysteries to solve, hidden rooms, who and what are the invisible creatures in and around the house, the book that may hold the answers to some of the mysteries and promises of more secrets, revealed in upcoming tomes. <BR>    This is a quick read for most kids, but even more fun to read aloud. Aside from the intriguing storyline offered, there is the artistic value it brings to children, from its smoothly textured, strikingly drawn cover to its deliciously illustrated pen and ink drawings, and roughly cut pages. Children have marveled over the Japanese anima, now hopefully they will be captivated (much as children and adults for generations have been by Arthur Rackman's art)  by Tony DiTerlizzi's stylish pen that feeds more then just our eyes.  This beginning series holds the promise of a gift for children that should become classics for all ages.
B00005JLH3|5.0|This movie was wonderful in that it showed what I have always known from growing up in a musical family -- being a part of a band and learning an instrument takes dedication and REAL teamwork.  If only every marching band out there would get the respect during a game that was shown in this movie.  As Nick Cannon's character discovers, every band member is a hard-working individual who works together for the group.  It's too bad that sports teams in the real world get most of the glory during these events, because every marching band deserves it so much more!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I absolutley love the new album from Christina Aguilera. The lyrics are more mature, and it sounds much better than her first CD. My favorite tracks are: Can't Hold Us Down, Walk Away, Fighter, Infatuation ( Primer Amor Interlude was a good intro ti the song), Loving Me 4 Me, Impossible, Beautiful, Underappreciated, Dirrty, and Keep Singing My Song. Overall, this is probably the best pop album ever. I would definitely recommend buying this. You'll enjoy listening to this for hours and hours, and definitely relate to most of the tracks.
B000066NW0|3.0|Is this punk ,as some say it trashes? No way, it is just good pop music. Is it lyrically or musically mind altering? Most likely not. I know I like the singalong jauntiness of some of it.<br />The measure of this album will be in years to come and whether those who listen to it today will continue to do so in their future years. <br />The measure of the artist will be if she can produce something better and more mature the next time out, and then the rest of us can judge this work against anything else Avril releases. As is, this album is not a classic, but it is good pop music, better than a lot of stuff on the charts at the moment anyway.<br />Like it or not for what it is, not what the image of the artist is supposed to be.
0800177177|3.0|After buying the film that when I was seven, thought that it was very disapointing to watch in full. With some horror films (ie. The Shining), time has done them even more justice (as nowadays Kubricks masterpiece is even more terrifying). This is not with Stokers Dracula. Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) directs a film that sadly does not terrify you the way a gothic horror vampire myth should. <BR>The Story? Young Jonathon Harker (Keanu Reeves, The Matrix) goes on a buisness trip to meet with Dracula (Gary Oldman, The Fith Element), an aging Transylvanian (hope I spelt that right!) count who is buying property in London. However, Harker's soon-to-be bride Mina Murry (Winona Ryder) is the reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife, who died four centuries ago and turned Dracula agaisnt God, causing him to turn into a vampire.<BR>So Dracula travels to London to meet Mina, causing all sorts of panic as his lust for blood grows. When Mina falls in love with him, Harker tries to fight for her but all is lost. Until Richard E. Grant calls in the highly thought of Professer Van Hesling (Tounge in cheek Anthony Hopkins) to rid the world of Dracula once and for all.<BR>Sadly the special effects let the film down and the acting (despite a very highly rated cast) is nothing to write home about. It's the costumes and settings that Dracula is worth watching for, and it is not scary as Dracula isnt a scary character, he's just an old man yearning for the love of his dead wife.<BR>Also, is it a true port of Bram Stokers novel? I have yet to read the book but apparently he says nothing of Mina being a look-like of Draculas wife nor Dracula becoming a vampire to spite God.<BR>Though it is entertaining and worth watching, but not worth buying.
B000060P79|1.0|Simply put (pun intended), this band is just the kind of pop that Mtv wants you to believe is actually Punk. Well, SP fans, as you might not know, there IS a thing called punk. And its main elements are: reckless musical abandon, and a 'we don't really give a f- about what anyone thinks' attitude, among other things. Now, of course SP has none of this at all. As a public service, I will guide you teens as to what Punk REALLY is. Bands such as The Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, Bad Religion, Dead Kennedys, and The Exploited embody the true Punk spirit. I know Mtv doesn't play them, and that most of you were not yet born, or were barely learning to say \\"mom\\" when these bands were around (exce[t Bad Reigion, who is still around). But, the fact that the almighty Mtv doesn't play them doesn't diminish their talent and impact one bit. In fact, to be played side-by-side with these SP guys would actually be demeaning to the bands mentioned. Again, I thank Mtv for their infallible way of promoting closed-mindedness and a complete lack of historical perspective on music. In other words, most kids today do not know that there indeed was music before Korn. Sad but true.
0812548094|1.0|The only thing that keeps Goodkind from being the most popular fantasy writer to date is the fact that all the plots are unoriginal, the dialogue is often unrealistic, and the characters never change.  Wizard's First Rule was worth buying and reading; it supplied hours upon hours of entertainment for me.  I enjoyed the characters and the action.  However, if Goodkind is only going to write one plot through out the entire series, I find no purpose in reading the rest of the 'Sword' books.  There's always some kind of badguy/villian who wants to conquer the world with either an object or his powers, and Richard along with Kahlan go out to destroy this evil being before his plans are accomplished.  While Kahlan and Richard are torn apart in this book, there's also an aggrivating sense of Dramatic irony, much like there was, (Irritatingly) in Wizard's First Rule with the Box of Orden being held right underneath their noses for about two hundred pages before they even think about it being held where it was.  Used with the right pen of the right author, this could be used as a suspenseful element, but when Goodkind uses it, it turns out as pure disaster. Goodkind, leave the dramatic irony for Shakespeare.  Also, might I add, Terry Goodkind's imagination is kind of warped in a weird sense.  It's not as sadistic as people are really saying it is, because Goodkind is just adding an element of gritty realisticness that chills to the bone, (The Mord-Sith are so scary, and the torture scenes are really brutal and it makes you feel as if you're there) but even with some experience and a rather good hand with the pen, he often bores the reader and drags out some scenes with romance scenes that feel like a daytime ABC soap opera.  <BR>     However, I would like to point out that he's not as bad as some people are saying he is.  He's not the worst writer in the world; he keeps the ingredients of a modern fantasy novel at hand to use, (Dragons, Kings, wizards, heroes, escapism, rescues, damsals in distress,) but his plotlines are often predictable.  Like I said earlier, they're really all the same.<BR>     What I just said, though, does not mean I support his stories.  The first one was a gem, yes, but it is because of writers like Goodkind, Jordan, and millions of others that fantasy is in the major piles of crud that it is.  Tolkien was a good author, but it is because of him that every other author of fantasy is constantly trying to conquer and dominate his world, which is simply impossible.  When will fantasy writers get over trying to be Tolkien?  There used to be such a thing as independant heroes who didn't wine during grave situations where they always had to have the help of friends or family or the local 'wizard' to come and save them.  We need more stories like the Red Sonja books, which are now, most unfortunately, out of print.  Howard's 'Conan' books.  I'm still convinced that no author has ever tried to pluck this genre which is going nowhere in my book out of the frustrating area that it dwells in.  We need real fantasy books with real, muscle-bound broadsword wielding heroes that slay beasts and monsters while laughing.  Not scared wanna-be Frodo's that travel across a land to get tortured and be broken in spirit until they accidentally stumble across the bad guy and then somehow get the magical item they started on the journey for in the first place.  <BR>     What I'm saying is, read Wizard's First Rule.  Then stop there.  The other books, simply in my opinion, are not worth reading.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I LOVED this movie. Aside from being one of the most thought-provoking movies I've ever seen, DONNIE DARKO is smart, funny, and brave. It dares to do things other movies wont even get near to. Anyone who gives this movie a bad review is just too stupid to even realize what this movie is actually about.
0142004235|2.0|If John Q-Nobody were to submit this manuscript to a publisher today, I doubt that it would make it out of the slush pile. The best parts of the book were Steinbeck's descriptions of flowers, rocks, hills and trees, which isn't saying much for the story.

B00003Q43A|3.0|I first saw this at the cinema, as a long time sci fi buff I'd seen the trailers and was expecting another Star Wars. I didn't get it and I think that may be the main problem. As a film it's OK A little heavy handed in parts ( The cute dog should have been crisped ). And the speeches, my god who wrote them, didn't the proof reader point out they were toe curlingly cheesy ? But OK wasn't enough after the build up. I can now watch ID on it's own merits and quite enjoy it, but the huge disappointment of that first viewing has lasted a long time.

B00005O3VC|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I had missed the beginning and thought it was a serious film. Due to my age and naiviete, I never really caught on until the end of the film. (Thanks to PBS)<br />Ever since then I have wanted to make films. Independent of course. And whenever we get to a boring sequence or a lull in the plot, I always vote to go silly and then get back on track with the original story.<br />Of course no one lets me do this, but I think it would have saved some otherwise unwatchable films. (Especially the ones I had a hand in!)<br />Amazing what they did with so little money. Thanks Pink Floyd!!
B000066NW0|3.0|What a shame that in America our culture so readily embraces an artist such as Avril Lavigne.  Nothing at all against her personally.  She probably is a perfectly wonderful human being!  But for such an overproduced, commercialized album with such a scripted feeling and -should I dare say- contrived sound to be so popular is a little troubling.  I do stress that I don't have anything against anyone who worked on or contributed to this album.<br />    For what it is, this cd was well done in that it was put together by talented craftsmen (with large budgets).  It is troubling though, that as far along as we as are, we (children and adults alike) listen to music like this and we refer to this person as an artist based on this product.  Imagine if other art forms were commercialized like music.  Just think -- \\"Here' a nice painting by Joe Artist.\\"  More like, \\"Here's a nice painting by Joe Artist's Label.\\"<br />    **  Two stars because there is a lot of worse stuff out there that has to have only one star with this rating system.<br />    *  One extra star because she seems to have another dimension, although it is very hard to detect on this cd, and for the fact that Avril probably would have been very good if she had not have been gotten a hold of so early, before she could even begin to develop into a great musician, [It is the responsibility of the people to not contribute with their dollars to whatever the big companies are marketing to you. There is truy just to much great music being recorded out there, and it's readily available.  Look around on Amazon, you could spend a fortune every day on truly great music.]<br />    Avril Lavigne's voice is fine the same way that Justin Timberlake of Nsync's voice is fine.  You would probably be able to enjoy it very much in a musical setting that was not totally devoid of any sort of meaningful emotional content.<br />    Oh well, we'll see.  I truly hope and almost expect that America will start to put more stock into what music should be about: An artist communicating his or her thoughts and emotions though the beautiful medium, thereby giving human beings a small emotional window to peer into the human condition.<br />    Just my -thoughtful but humble- opinion
B00005JLET|5.0|This is one of the very best animated movies I have ever seen.  Everything about this movie was done extremely well.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This movie is great for people that like to have all of their questions answered about the Matrix.  This is a masterpeice.  9 short films are all or pretty much all depressing, but if you think about it the Matrix itself is a depressing story.  So there is a lack of happy endings in the 9 short films.  But there is a story in particular that is called World Record, which is in fact the most emotional gripping story.  I'm not going to ruin the story for you, but if you get this DVD then you will check it out for yourself and probably even agree with me.  I love this DVD, compiled of 9 short films.
B00005N5S5|4.0|James Cameron was sick as a dog in Rome. He was working the on post-production of his first film as a director (Piranha 2)when he dreamed up The Terminator. Although it wasn't offically acknowledged for some time, Cameron was inspired by The Outer Limits and episodes like Harlan Ellison's Solider. Regardless, of the inspiration Cameron's take on the material created a new subgenre within film--tech noir.<br /><br />The Terminator works amazingly well even when it has no reason to do so. Cameron's understanding of moviemaking along with that of his collaborators Gale Anne Hurd (his co-writer on the final screenplay helping to flesh out Sarah Conner's character among many other things), Stan Winston (who build the Terminator exoskeletons and worked on the make up), music composer Brad Fidel and cinematographer Adam Greenberg helped create a viable action packed science fiction classic of the 80's.<br /><br />The plot is as familar as the taste of chicken noodle soup--The Terminator is send into the past to kill Sara Conner. Conner will be the mother of the human resistance movement. He becomes instrumental in defeating Skynet a computer software program that literally takes control of the world and uses the weapons humans have developed to attempt to wipe out humanity.<br /><br />John Conner, Sarah's son in the future, sends back one of his soliders Kyle to save Sarah's life and prevent the Terminator from taking her life. What ensues is a battle between human and machine that acts as a microversion of what is going to occur in the future.<br /><br />While the popular sequel is a better film all around, the original has grit missing from Cameron's slicker effort. The third film in the series Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine manages to recapture some of the grit of the original and combine it with the operatic and convoluted plot of the second film. Whatever The Terminator lacks in sophisticated visual effects, it more than makes up for in solid storytelling and a b-movie sensibility that works well.<br /><br />While I like the two sequels, The Terminator established a new subgenre in film and helped spawn countless imitations. It created a new template.<br /><br />The transfer is very good although it still has quite a few analog artifacts and defects. Still, the transfer is crisp, clean and sharp looking. The disc is an interesting amalgamation of two different discs. The movie is on one side in a dual layered format for optimal visual quality. The transfer is from a new digital master from a high definition transfer (which might explain why so many flaw are evident). The remix into 5.1 sound is also high quality as well and very good. The original mono soundtrack is included for comparison.<br /><br />There isn't an audio commentary for the entire picture like T2 but there is a sequence of deleted scenes with Cameron's comments on them.There are a number of original storyboards included on the second side along with the other supplentary material. This is on a single layered side of the disc. Additionally, trailers, new interviews and a new documentary are included. All in all, this version is an improvement on the very good laserdisc from 7 years ago..

B00009RDG9|5.0|L.T. Bonham's (Tommy Lee Jones) student went off the deep end, so he had to track him down. Hallam (Benicio Del Toro) was the trained assassin who became traumatized after an incident in Kosovo. FBI agent Abby Durrell (Connie Nielsen) summoned the retired tracker to search for Hallam after a couple of hunters were murdered by him. Portland forests are now terrifying. This movie was spectacular! The knife battle at the end was extraordinary! More cutting than a deli sandwich shop! Sliceage! L.T. represented someone I know! Yes! Always running and getting sick because of heights. Comedy! I've been there, done that. I'm more trained than anybody in this movie. My mission is to write good reviews and make people think of them as preposterous. Only the intelligent people will understand the meaning of my reviews and appreciate them. I'm highly skilled and more qualified than L.T. So that will explain the insane reviews. Don't you get it? This is one of the best movies of the year!
0670451495|5.0|I am a student at West Virginia State College and taking a Childrens lit. class. Make way for ducklings is a delightful book and i strongly reccommend it to children of all ages. It's nice to read a book like this that is simple and sweet that all children can enjoy.
B000099T2L|3.0|i am a fan of destiny's child and since beyonce sings all their songs anyway, i was looking foward to her cd, but it is just average.  a couple of standouts, for example BE WITH YOU, and the current single CRAZY IN LOVE.  SPEECHLESS is pretty good, a bit reminicent of the faboulous Aaliyah.  Maybe the cd doesn't seem as good because i expected more, but overall, she did okay.
0446310786|5.0|I recently read this book for an honors english assignment. I loved the book. I think everyone who gets the oppertunity should definatly read this one!
B0000508U6|5.0|If you are wondering about this cd and any other Coldplay cd's you just can't go wrong. Something about their music is very soothing and great to listen to. I would have to highly recommend this to anyone that is thinking about purchasing it.
B00005JM09|3.0|The plot of \\"Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines\\" is no different from that of T2:  two cyborgs, one programmed to kill eventual savior John Connor and the other to protect him, are zapped through time.  This conflict, a classic chase scene set-up, comprises the entire movie.  Without the questions of ethics and the unpredictability of the future uses of technology explored in T2, T3 is all action and no substance.  This will delight many fans and disappoint others.<br />Nick Stahl as John Connor is an unlikely hero: nihilistic, hollow-eyed, and physically unimposing.  Claire Danes is exceptional in her role as the reluctant but fierce Kate who maintains her class even as she watches Schwarzenegger spit out a bullet.  Schwarzenegger plays his cyborg as he always has, with the same deadpan delivery whether he is expressing a horrific truth or poking fun at the previous films in the series.  I know a lot of people object to Kristianna Loken as the new T-X model, but I loved her.  She exhibits both the cold ambition of a machine and the tastes of a predator.<br />The action sequences are all high-gear, breathtaking excitement even if the logic of them isn't always clear.  The screenwriters have provided some hilarious moments to punctuate the tension, many of which refer to jokes established in T1 and T2.  The ending is both surprising and surprisingly original, the only solid plot in the movie.<br />If you are a Terminator fan, you must see this film.  Chase scene devotees and those with a hunger for pure action will love it.  The two hours pass quickly when you're gripping the arms of your chair, but don't expect to take anything away from this movie.  If you want even a modicum of substance with your action, skip this.  Four stars for the action, two for the plot.
6300182770|4.0|Three references came to mind when watching this film. <BR>     The first was the philosophy of David Hume, particularly his idea that one can have no knowledge of ultimate reality. This film, with its hallucinations within hallucinations, asks the question \\"What would a man do if he couldn't trust his own basic perceptions?\\". Also, in accordance with Hume's teachings, we (the viewers) are never granted the \\"reality\\" of the story. <BR>   The second reference was a popular criticism of Brian Eno. Lydia Lunch said of his music; \\"...all it is is just something that flows and weaves, flows and weaves...It means nothing.\\" This has been a popular criticism of Cronenberg's as well (in this movie and others), since Cronenberg often avoids conventional plot structure. That his work in this film means nothing, though, is a criticism I dispute. This film is interesting, it is thrilling (Woods' performance is electric). Yes, this film is often visually disturbing, and rarely coherent. But these feelings are the result of seeing events through the eyes of Woods' character, who is just as confused and even more disturbed than we are. I couldn't take my eyes off of this movie. <BR>   The final reference that came to mind was a much more recent film by this film's director called \\"Existenz\\". Both films were written by Cronenberg, and he appears to be making all the same points in both. \\"Videodrome\\" is the better of the two. It is rawer, cheesier, more visceral. It goes for the throat in a way that Existenz does not. <BR>     And again, Woods is terrific. The nervous energy that is seen in all of his work suits this material perfectly.<BR>   A plot synopsis is unnecessary for this film. The people who are going to like it would have their experience diminished by any attempt at summary. This film is labeled as \\"science-fiction\\". But there are things in this film that defy genre. Deborah Harry's sultry performance is one. It stands entirely on its own. And really, your inner-geek hasto be in a coma for you to not get a thrill out of lines like \\"Death to Videodrome! Long Live the New Flesh!!\\"
B00009QG73|4.0|I put the DVD into the player with some trepidation. Loved Roxy at their peak in the Seventies and Eighties, but hadn't heard from / of them for the best part of 15 years. I needn't have worried one bit. The Man and the Band are in fine form, both visually and sonically, and perform truly first rate renditions of their best album and single tracks in this 2001 concert recording. <BR> <BR>If you weren't a big Roxy fan, there will be a few unfamiliar tunes during the first half of the disc, but keep watching as the second half is basically a back-to-back Greatest Hits sequence and is a real treat for everybody. And talk about hits, what truly great hits they were indeed.  Innovative, catchy and supremely well-crafted, they have stood the test of time very  well, which is more than can be said about the music from most other &quot;visual&quot; bands of the era. From the lilting Avalon, through the addictive Love Is The Drug and the slightly manic Street Life, this is British pop/rock of the highest caliber.  The lucky London Apollo audience certainly had a good time, and so did I!  Why I even caught a glimpse of Mr. Ferry smiling a couple of times! <BR> <BR>Video production and audio quality are also excellent, though to split hairs, I would have liked more than one &quot;overhead flying camera&quot; route, and from memory, the lead vocals were a little more upfront in the original renditions.  This can be easily rectified by increasing center channel volume in a surround sound setup. Pan-and-Scan viewers will experience exceptional camera framing, while Wide-screen viewers will feel more immersed in the entire concert atmosphere.  As a personal observation, I found the drum sound a little \\"soft\\" (intentionally perhaps, for that Seventies sound?), with less transients than other recent recordings.  Conversely, I found the stage a little clinical (what, no dry ice?!?) and anyone hoping to see the &quot;trademark&quot; seductive Roxy ladies of yore will have to make do with more contemporary versions (not a bad thing, really).  Other than providing lyrics, the only other extra on the DVD is a tastefully executed short documentary, informally hosted by band member Phil Manzanera, of the band preparing for and beginning the tour series. <BR> <BR>So here we have it Ladies and Gentlemen.  A truly fine DVD memento from a band whose music and legacy will live on and on, For Your Pleasure!
B00005JM09|4.0|I'll admit the speculation in my mind was more than present when I had learned of a new Terminator film minus the talents of creator James Cameron and stars Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong; but when the credits for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines began to roll I walked out of the theater with quite a smile on my face.  Director Jonathan Mostow is a more than worthy successor to Cameron; he has crafted a very well put together and visually stunning action film that will quiet all the naysayers and return star Arnold Schwarzenegger to superstar form.  Nick Stahl is a worthy sucessor to Eddie Furlong as well in the role of John Conner: the man who is destined to lead humanity to victory against the machines.  The storyline picks up with John living \\"off the grid\\".  Even though the Judgement Day of 1997 was prevented, he lives with no phone, no address, no real identity, nothing to get himself traced by the machines in the future.  His worst fears are confirmed when the Terminatrix (the stunning Kristanna Loken) arrives from the future to take him and some of his acquaintances out (including Claire Danes in a lively role), and he is soon joined by a familiar looking Termiantor re-programed to make sure that he survives the upcoming nuclear nightmare.  Everything about Terminator 3 is big: incredible special effects, eye-popping action scenes, and insane stunt work make this film the best action film of the summer next to X-Men 2.  Schwarzenegger himself is at his usual best in the role of the emotionless cyborg, and as usual gives a terrific performance.  Of course the film doesn't have the epic emotional scope of the first two films, but that is instantly forgiveable once the action kicks in.  Also, many long time Terminator fans will notice the numerous in jokes present throughout the film (including Earl Boen returning as Dr. Silberman in a hilarious throwaway scene).  Clearly the writers, and Mostow himself, weren't afraid to play with Cameron's source material.  Yes, this is a blatant cash in by Warner Bros., but I don't think I've ever seen one this good..  Yes, this is a blatant cash in by Warner Bros., but I don't think I've ever seen one this good.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|That's not the best way to describe this movie, but that's one of the many words I have used to describe this movie.<br />First, on a pure side-note, I think Jennifer Connelly looks amazing in this movie--and not just from some \\"special scenes\\" but in general. (and hell, looks good all the time) I just like this girl [woman] as an actress and a female--great body.<br />Second I was expecting to be disturbed or so as all these people who have seen the movie said, but man was this movie GREAT and disturbing. NOT trying to SPOIL anything, so I'll just say this:<br />Harry's character, jeez...<BR>Marrion's character, holy [cow] ;)... (can't say i didn't like it)<BR>Tyrone, damn dude...<BR>Sara, woah...<br />Amazing movie, I think I'll watch it again. ;)<br />Great story, none of this happy ending [stuff], amazing acting IMO, shocking/disturbing, brilliant film-making, all that stuff. :P<br />JUST WATCH IT ALREADY!...

B0000033IS|5.0|Well I remember Aretha's Columbia years.  An interesting singer with some fine albums such as &quot;Unforgettable,&quot; her tribute to Dinah Washington.  But not memorable in any way.  Then came &quot;I Never Loved A Man,&quot; the single, and instantly everyone knew one of the greatest music stars of all time had arrived. (Or, as was written, &quot;She makes up for losing Bille Holiday.&quot;).  When &quot;Respect&quot; and the album landed the deal was sealed and Aretha went sailing forth with hit after hit--&quot;Baby I Love You,&quot; the incredible &quot;Natural Woman,&quot; then &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; (have you ever heard the original version of the record before it was heavily edited with Aretha's unforgettable spoken introduction?) and right on down the line.  And album after album after album of sheer brilliance.  She's still around and still doin' it--word is her forthcoming album &quot;So Damned Happy&quot; is terrific.  &quot;I Never Loved A Man&quot; certainly has met the test of time.  It's as stunning today as it was when it first appeared.  It's one of the greatest albums ever made.
B000002L7R|4.0|This is the album that separates the Prince fans from the Purple Rain fans.An audatious move for Prince,to follow up a blockbuster like Purple Rain with an ambitious,yet wildly uneven piece of work.It has it moments like Raspberry Beret,Pop Life& Paisley Park,the rest is semi-memorable.The only reason Tamborine sticks to the brain it,s because its so annoying. This album is a prime example of an artist following their muse,and not be dictated by industry second guessing.Most simply run the formula into the ground,or just give up artistcally.It may not be Princes finest LP,but it's his boldest statement
B00006RU5B|4.0|I was so looking forward to the release of this album and I went out and got it the day it was released. AUDIOSLAVE is a great rock album in a time when what dominates the soundwaves is so manufactured. I think this album is a true musical gem. Because of the history of the band members, there was so much hype regarding this band, it would be almost impossible to live up to it. While the band didnt, they came pretty darn close to doing that. The album starts off with 5 killer tracks: COCHISE, SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE, GASOLINE, WHAT YOU ARE, LIKE A STONE. I just love putting this disc in a cranking the stereo loud. The middle of the disc kind of just plays along, the songs are not bad, they just dont jump out and scream for you to listen to them. I also enjoy listening to last part of the album startimg with BRING EM BACK ALIVE. Overall, this is a true solid rock effort from the band, and I think that it is a good disc to have
B00005JLXE|4.0|This is a pretty good adaptation of the Frank Miller run as artist/writer on the Daredevil comic book. Great cast, good action sequences and above average CGI effects combine to make this a comic book adaptation that general audiences can enjoy as much as comic fans. <br />The special features are excellent. My favourite is the hour long series of interviews with the various writers and artists who have worked on the comic since its creation in the 1960s. It was great to see artist Gene Colan have his say as I have been a fan of his work since the mid-1970s. Equally interesting are the interviews with Frank Miller, Kevin Smith, John Romita and his son John Jr (a really great guy who I had the pleasure of meeting in the early 1990s). <br />The obligatory making of documentary is well worth a look too, especially the early costume fittings and talk of uncertainty amongst studio executives about the look of Daredevil. Not the usual PR puff-piece and a good insight into the making of the film.<br />There are loads of other worthy features, and the film itself ain't too shabby either...so take my advice and order this film now, true believers! Excelsior!
B00008DDXL|5.0|this movie was awesome!! it was way better than the first. It was funny, exciting, and scary at the same time. I was very astonished by rons charecter because after all the funny things he sais he never laughd once. My favorite scene was the end when he finds the chamber of secrets and takes on the basilisk. I definitely recomend u to buy this video. DVD or VHS its great.
B00005JM09|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, having been a fan of the previous two.  Unfortunately the dialog is very weak (Arnolds best lines are the ones taken from his previous movies), the acting is weaker and the actors lack the chemistry that was present in the previous two.<br />If want to see it for the special effects, than by all means go for it.  Just don't expect anything more than that.<br />I have to give this movie a solid \\"D\\", and that is being generous.

B000092ZYX|1.0|This is more way-out-there stuff liek Kid A and you should only purchase this album if you are a devout Radiohead fan. If you are new to Radiohead or are just looking for some great music from this band, purchase The Bends instead.
0688163173|5.0|I am a Lehane fan, but this book brought his writing to a whole new level.  It starts with what seems to be an odd postlog,  then moves into the simple detective novel genre.  Eventually it becomes one of the most astounding novels I have ever read.  &quot;Shutter Island&quot; much more than &quot;Mystic River&quot; qualifies Dennis Lehane as a top notch writer who writes with the type of skill I generally attribute to authors who have written classics.  That being said the dark side of this book will prevent it from being included in the high school curriculam.  This is an amazing book.  An absolute must read for anyone who likes Patterson, Sandford, Connelly, King, or any of the other good (and bad) writers of thrillers out there.
B000002G60|5.0|Vega continued to re-invent herself throughout the 90s. This was her second &quot;industrial-folk&quot; album and it would be followed by Songs In Red And Grey in 2001 (which sounded less 'produced' than Nine Objects).<br />Nine Objects Of Desire has some of her most memorable songs and the album never sinks too deep into mediocrity. The stand-out tracks are the jazzy &quot;Caramel&quot;, the groovy &quot;No Cheap Thrill&quot;, the silvery &quot;World Before Columbus&quot; and the closing number &quot;My Favourite Plum&quot;. Personally I prefer the follow-up to this album. If you end up liking Nine Objects you should definitely try Songs In Red And Gray.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because I have not yet bought the CD.  However, most people fall in the middle of the scale in regards to their sexuality.  No, these girls aren't lesbian. They have said they aren't!  Does it mean they are fake?!  NO!  They are bisexual young women.  Does this mean they are swingers or  \\" just in a phase\\" or \\"just not admitting the truth\\" NO!  These girls give a voice to bisexual persons.  They self admitedly love their boyfriends and it is unmistakable to see they have a  love for eachother as well. Granted at times on stage, they may stereotype themselves and other bisexuals by being openly overly sexual onstage. <br />However, their relationship is NOT fake. You can tell by looking at how they look at eachother. It is NOT just LUST enacted by petty teenagers. There is a love between these girls you can see when they are interviewed. They hold hands and share a genuine love. BRITINEY SPEARS???  I fail to see the comparison.  Blessings to these girls who are berated and judged for being who they are.
B00008VGL6|5.0|This is an album that has many layers to it. You have to hear it a few times to appreciate its depth. Martin Gore has created an album of cover songs that is both tasteful and stays true to his Depeche Mode roots. I have heard some of these songs in their orignal format and believe me , Gore has re-interprted them as well as one possibly can. The highlight for me &quot;I cast a lonesome shadow&quot;. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves music.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Good movie and features but the trailer wasn't the one I'd seen in many times in the theater. Ah well.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Superb renditions of Floyd classics as well as some new stuff!  Gilmour is still the best guitarist in rock - the emotion and stylistic overtones in his playing are remarkable.  Definitely worth the price.  The only negative was the singing for Water's part of Comfortably Numb - very poor job by some old guy and Geldoff....  Otherwise awesome.
B000001ZS8|5.0|There are some truly groundbreaking electronic albums out there and Zoolook is one of them. JMJ's first abums, Oxygene and Equinoxe are excellent. His 3rd album, Magnetic Fields has some great tracks but does not have the same impact. Perhaps realising this, JMJ set upon a new path. Zoolook is the result. I was 13 when this album came out and it blew my mind. Often an artist ventures in a new direction and looses himself in the process. This is not the case with Zoolook. Jarre sampled recordings of idiginious voices from many countries into his Fairlight CMI,then processed them, turning them into alien sounding instruments. Zoolook is not some arty farty attempt at creativity. The emotional responses this album engenders for me is the same nowdays as it was in 1984, the music and production was and is ahead of its time. Zoolook, Oxygene and Equinoxe are JMJ's greatest creations. Zoolook is completely different from his previous and later work. Deserving 5 stars, Zoolook is one of the most original albums ever made. My favourite album for many years, I continue to hear new things every time i give Zoolook a spin. Check it out at all costs.
B000003S0B|3.0|While I enjoy listening to King Crimson, and its various incarnations, I don't find myself listening to this one that often. The reason for this is that it's a mere rehash of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", their 1969 debut release. Some of the tunes share a similar structure, if not feel, to the previous. If you've heard any of their other albums, you'd know that they aren't ones to do the same thing twice.<br />Early '69 through '70 was a rough time for Robert Fripp, leader and co-founder of King Crimson. The principal songwriter, keyboardist and saxophone player, Ian McDonald left the group for reasons unknown (to me....I think that he was tired of touring, something that puzzles me, considering he co-founded FOREIGNER a few years later), as well as drummer extraordinare, Michael Giles. These two would eventually make their own album, curiously entitled McDonald/Giles (!!). Greg Lake, the vocalist/bassist, quit as a touring member, yet returned as a performer on \\"Wake of Poseidon\\".<br />How to describe the music? Well.....the first track, \\"Peace-A Beginning\\" is little more than Greg Lake's voice, gently crooning for a little over a moment, followed by an extremely silent acoustic guitar. The second track, \\"Pictures of a City\\", blasts through at full-throttle. It's a hip track, very heavy and trademark Krimson. However, it's just too too similar to \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" from their debut. It even has a breakdown in the middle with Fripp playing a semi-jazzy riff. The vocals are done by Greg Lake, and this is Mel Collin's first appearance on saxophone.<br />'Cadence and Cascade'- Sung by Gordon Haskell (a man who is apparently fairly well known in England). He had a weak voice, so while the guitar and flute are lovely, it doesn't go very far. A remix with Adrian Belew's voice on a later boxed set is essential. <br />Title track- Much too similar to the first albums \\"Epitaph\\", replete with the bombastic Mellotrons and Peter Sinfield lyrics of Greek imagery.<br />Peace- A Theme  Simply a Fripp solo on clean electric guitar. Has some pretty jazzy chords....he doesn't do anything like this these days.<br />Cat Food- One of their oddest songs. Stamped with the piano of British jazz musician Keith Tippett, with coincidentally sounds like a cat walking across the keyboard. The lyrics are nonsense and the song doesn't go much past a simple R&B groove. Still, it stands out on this album. <br />Devil's Triangle- Oh man, this track is amazing. It's reportedly a reworked version of a classical piece called \\"Mars\\" by a composer named Holst (?) It has some truly demonic Mellotron (orchestra-like keyboard, for those not in the know), as well as some great drumming by \\"studio only\\" Michael Giles.<br />Peace-An End  Basically a reprise of the first song, with some changes in instrumentation.<br />You'd think that i'd love this album so much, based on my extensive review, but again it's just too similar to another recording of theirs. It really just seemed like Fripp wanted to find the success of that one. However, he went in a whole other direction, and consequently an entire Fripp sound.<br />Check this one out. It's not essential, but it's good. Just don't expect a whole lot if you've already heard \\"In the Court...\\".
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is unarguably the BEST motion picture of the year (hence the Oscar win) and in my opinion the best movie in ten years. Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply amazing and deserves every amount of praise she has received for her role as the sexy Velma Kelly. Rene Zellweger surprised audiences, bringing a new style to the role of Roxie Hart, but she isn't a natural musical theatre star like Zeta-Jones. Richard Gere shone as Billy Flynn, but his tap dancing left something to be desired. The musical numbers in this movie were nothing short of outstanding and left the audiences blown away. Rob Marshall brought his genius to this motion picture with the stage-like staging. While in the movie theatre it almost felt like watching a live performance on a stage. This is exemplified especially in numbers like \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and Catherine Zeta-Jones' best moment \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\".<BR>Some reviewers have compared Chicago to last year's attempt-at-a musical Moulin Rouge. Chicago is what we call a real musical (with original songs and a solid 7 year run on Broadway with multiple Tony awards). Moulin Rouge was a movie that tried too hard. Moulin Rouge had potential but had too much fancy camera work that gave half its audience a headache. The dance sequences were awful. The camera moved so fast and was on such inappropriate angles for dancing that too much was lost; unlike Chicago where the cinematography showed off the dancing. Nicole Kidman is one of the greatest actresses of all time and was great in Moulin Rouge, but when it comes to musicals Catherine Zeta-Jones SHINES!<BR>Chicago is wonderful and it earned every Oscar it won. Moulin Rouge didn't win at the Oscars because it just wasn't good enough. Chicago saved the face of the musical movie by showing the world how a musical movie should be.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The first piece of work i heard from Howard Shore was the That Thing You Do! soundtrack, a very poppy sound. I could hardly believe that this was the same man! The Fellowship of the Rings soundtrack is a rich body of work with a human feel. Not over programmed, but ear candy. If you like swelling glorious sounds with emotion and lots of deep choral mixed with the simple whimsical sounds of the countryside, you will love this soundtrack.<br />This is music that will give you chills. Such songs as 'Flight to the Ford' and 'Breaking of the Fellowship'. <br />Another thing i appreicitated about this album is their trueness to the book. They took all song titles from the titles of book chapters. <br />In addition to Howard Shore's genious, we receive the musical talent of Enya. Her flowing sounds blend perfectly as a sort of elvish theme. She also provides &quot;May it Be&quot;, the credits song for this movie, a gorgeous song.<br />If you've never heard Howard Shore before. Now is the time to try!
080013558X|4.0|&quot;Charmless and dull&quot;???  What planet are you on?<BR>This movie is superb, complete with great stars and terrific musical score.  It's definitely a classic, to be enjoyed many times -- one to share with family and friends.
B000099T2L|4.0|While going on my search for good female albums i found this one to be the better one. Some of the songs have some nice beats and her voice just makes it better. Songs like &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Crazy in love&quot;(kinda gets played too much on the radio tho'), and &quot;dangerously in love,&quot; makes the album stand out of those that are not so good (hence Ashanti's Chapter II). Pretty good album, but there are some songs i can't really take. Better than Monica and Ashanti(please don't get this one, not that good) Good job Beyonce!
630416923X|4.0|What to say? It's the Beatles, telling their story. Plenty of footage, lots to see and learn. Entertainment from and about the most overhyped rock group in history. <br />Last little message: if you buy anything on auction, make sure you know what your'e doing.
0385509456|5.0|The fictional author of \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" was an autistic 15-year-old boy (named Christopher Boone) intent on solving the murder of a neighborhood dog.  Since the boy approached life purely with logic and order, he was unable to face any situation with emotions or feelings.  This unique viewpoint made for an absolutely original novel (rich with enchanting, honest, and intellectual prose) unlike any other I have ever encountered.  Ironically, the complex plot that unraveled during Christopher's detecting might have been more invigorating than some of the best thrillers/mysteries I've read.  Until I stumbled upon this book, I had my own manufactured comprehension of autism.  My son Joshua attended Nursery School with an autistic child last year, and I observed some of that boy's behavioral traits.  Although I also studied autism in my college psychology classes, and I did work briefly with an autistic child at a gifted camp, I really had few opportunities to interact with individuals afflicted with this unusual and often debilitating ailment.  Mark Haddon's real-life experience with autistic children allowed him to craft this masterpiece by providing the perspective of a young autistic teenager, not by another author's observations of the exterior physical behaviors, but through the interior workings that composed the thought patterns of the boy's afflicted mind.  In many ways, autism provided the perfect mind for detective work because emotions were never a factor during the investigation.  However, in other ways, autism created roadblocks that could never be understood by people unaccustomed to this mind-blowing anomaly.  <br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />How does the autistic mind work (paraphrased/enhanced/interpreted from Haddon's book)?<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />Non-Autistic Joe:<br />It is Monday morning and Joe awakens to find it raining and cold outside.  As Joe prepares breakfast, he feels a sense of angst because the weather has already predetermined his day's destiny.  Backing out of the driveway, Joe initiates the windshield-wipers, turns on the car defrost and breathes out a moan of contention because he knows he is going to have a bad day.<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />Autistic Christopher:<br />On the bus ride to school, Christopher starts counting consecutive automobiles.  If he sees 4 yellow cars in a row, he knows he is going to have a black day.  However, if he encounters 4 red cars in a row, he knows he will experience a good day yet if he sees 3 red cards in a row, he will have quite a good day.  Five red cars in a row will provide Christopher with a super good day.  Also, Christopher will never eat food that is yellow or brown.<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />Explanation:<br />The non-autistic mind uses emotions and feelings to predict (along with order and logic).  The autistic mind can only use order and logic to make decisions.  Non-autistic people regard Christopher's way of predicting good and bad days as illogical even if it does follow some strange order.  On the other hand, how does basing good and bad days on the weather end up being more logical than the decision to base good and bad days on the color of consecutive cars?<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  <br />Non-Autistic Joe:<br />Joe's bedroom reflects his personality yet he constantly changes furniture and wall hangings to reflect his current interests.  When Joe goes on vacation, he finds it refreshing to encounter new situations, new places and new people.  On a recent vacation to South Carolina, Joe sat out on the porch of a civil-war era Bed and Breakfast and reflected on the God given wonders of the world.<br />* * * * * * * * * ** * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  <br />Autistic Christopher:<br />Christopher's bedroom has never changed since he  was an infant.  If his Mom cleans the room and moves a poster one millimeter, Christopher is forced to crouch down on the floor and moan for the loss of order to his world.  Christopher hates Paris because it contains too much stimuli in the form of new buildings, new people, posters, signs, etc.  This overwhelming influx of stimuli drives him almost mad with pain and angst.  Christopher?'s only recourse is to crouch into a fetal position and to moan or scream.  Nothing about this new place can be credited to God because the autistic mind won't comprehend things that can't be seen.  All entities must be tangible.  The idea of God is problematical for the autistic mind.  <BR>* * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />Autistic Phenomenon (Christopher likes maths):<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />Perhaps my favorite component of Mark Haddon's book dealt with the numerous references to mathematical algorithms, formulas, logic and computations.  I just might have to put this book on a required reading list for my high school math students.  Autistic minds do tend to have certain strengths and anomalies despite perceived deficits.  Many autistic individuals possess math brilliance, musical prowess or scientific expertise.  Christopher was gifted in \\"maths\\" and the book played homage to this unique talent.  As a math geek, I was thrilled by the book's inclusion of the Pythagorean Theorem, The Monty Hall Problem, Statistical Analysis, Mapping Algorithms, Game Theory, Relativity, Tessellations, Proofs and Mental Math Algorithms.  I have never encountered so many math applications in a pleasure book before in my life.<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />Summary:<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br />Most of you know that I write reviews for the sheer cathartic release it provides me.  However, I must go out on a limb (by the way, you can't use metaphors with autistic individuals), and implore you to find this book and read it with gusto over the summer.  You will find it rewarding, entertaining and educational.  If any of you know anybody dealing with autistic relatives or friends, please tell them of this book.  It offers enough insight to make it a must read for anybody dealing directly with autism.  Additionally, Christopher's detective work uncovered more than the culprit of a dog homicide; it unleashed raw emotion mainly because the young author was unable to express any of his own.  I was moved to tears of laughter and heartbreak while I remained glued to every single word on every single page of this 226-page masterpiece.  This is my favorite book of all time.  Bravo Mark Haddon!<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  <br />My Overwhelming Grade:  A+++
