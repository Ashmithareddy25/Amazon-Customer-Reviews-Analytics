0142004413|5.0|Read this one for book group.  Reminiscent of Annie Dillard's \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek\\" - except with a British upper class lens and Mediterranean Islands locale.  Very enjoyable!
0439023491|5.0|It almost hurts to read such a good book. Read my review for the first book in the series. Same comments. The storyline is again -- like the first book -- riveting and mihdblowing. Character development is deep and binds you to the characters. I would say more about this book but I'm too excited to start reading the final book in the series.<br /><br />Three thumbs up, hands down.
B00846REIS|1.0|OK, I am not a prude, but this book is awful.  I really enjoyed 50 Shades, however this is a rip off done by a 14 year-old boy who stole his Dad's Penthouse Mag in the 80's.  SPOILER ALERT  Messed up rich, beautiful people, both molested hook up and have raunchy sex and don't understand each other.  Boy tries to rape girl in her sleep because he is having a nightmare.  She runs away, he chases.  Bi roomate has drugged fueled orgy because he hates his life (he is a beautiful high priced fashion model).  The word C-word is used a lot, really? Not a turn on at all... Where 50 Shades is Great Mommy Porn, this is just plain smut.  No plot at all.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This was an excellent product.  The case it came in, the pictures and the  information included was great. Much more than was expected.  It has been very  entertaining and enjoyable.  I am not one bit disappointed in this selection.
B005L38QK2|3.0|Ok First off the price is ok, not good not bad just ok. The item is sleek and easy to hold onto and feel good in your hand. The design and the lights are a nice touch to give you that Diablo feeling while playing, although your hand covers the lights while using the mouse. The mouse it fairly responsive when you use it however it does once in a while suffer from the jitters if you pick it up and then place it back down again to move it. But this is quickly fixed. The cord is of reasonable length and very durable. The interface for the buttons is adequate at most and the life time click feature is never accurate. It tells me I have used button 4 which is on the side over 120,000 times though I have only had the mouse for a few months so that's not exactly accurate. The major downside for me was I have large hands, and the 4 side buttons are to close together to click them comfortably especially with my pinky. I feel I might have been better off with a plain mouse or maybe one of the form fit game pad/mice that are shaped like your hand with the extra buttons at each finger tip. SO again, it ok, not great. But if you're a Diablo fan like me, your end up getting it in the end anyway,
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wanted to like this book. But I didn't like any of it. The writing is just awful. The characters are bland and I don't care for either of them.  It's just about the worst written book I've ever read.  I'm just scratching my head to figure out what the hub bub is about. I'm just embarrassed for the author, and the readers that got sucked into the hype.
B000G6BM00|5.0|The second and last truly good Aliens movie.  You really can't go wrong owning this.  Lots of good action, aliens, a great cast and of course I can't leave out the one and only Hudson.  He makes this movie for me.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Sylvester Stallone at his best, this is traditional 80s action series and there are no wands or magic involved! Great series and a great actor.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|This book, in my opinion, is too fantastical to believe. Never in one person's life could this many coincidences take place. Sure, we have to suspend belief to appreciate any fiction we read, but this book asks that we suspend reality and dive deeply into it at the same time. A shame that all the purported research went into this book to make it believable but then it is made unbelievable by the fairy tale-like coincidences and meetings in the main character's life. I quit halfway through because it was just too much to swallow. Maybe I'm over fiction? On to a memoir...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed this series overall. I found it was an enlightening insight into the world of Dominant and Submissive lifestyles and it did a good job of portraying the trust that must exist between partners in those relationships. The writing style itself left much to be desired.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is an awesome video.  The Stones at one of their many peaks.  Blistering versions of tumbling dice, rip this joint, all down the line, and a great solo on love in vain by Mick Taylor.  I owned the bootleg, but this is much clearer.  The sound and video is not quite modern, but the sound of the stones from that era is captured.  If u like rock n roll this is a must have, buy it!
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a very special book. I saw the high ratings and just had to order it to read and I so glad that I did.<br /><br />The two main characters in the story, Gus and Hazel, are both totally credible characters. They are two young teens fighting against cancer and the story covers issues of how one might really feel if dealt the dreaded C-word. It is tender, heart-breaking, humorous, and just plain ol' down-to-earth.<br /><br />Gus is my favorite character because he has such a great sense of humor. He reminds me of my brother-in-law when he was fighting cancer and the funny sayings that came out of his mouth. I loved Gus for that reason and because he has such a tender, loving heart. Every girl would want such a guy.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone, young (teens) and old!
0618871713|2.0|Maybe I didn't look clsely enough when I ordered this book.....I didn't realize that it was in comic book style......stopped reading it after the first few pages.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The Indian Jones quadrilogy is the greatest quadrilogy in the history of motion pictures. This set of movies changed my life, it saved my life too. Many a night I spent wandering the streets only to find myself back at home curled up watching Temple of Doom.<br /><br />Buy the quadrilogy on Blu-Ray and it will change your life as it has changed mine.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|i absolutely love this cd!  every single song sticks in your head!  lovelovelove it! it even makes this old woman want to dance
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the greatest of the 4 Indiana Jones epics. In my expert professional opinion, Temple of Doom is the greatest movie ever made in the history of motion pictues and cinematic theatre. This second installment is better than Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, and Death Wish 4. Temple of Doom made me want to join the Thugee Cult and I have dressed up as Mola Ram for Halloween for the past 19 years of my life. Talk about inspiration!<br /><br />Temple of Doom also saved my life from ruins in the gutter. Many a night I spent wandering the underbelly of the concrete jungle, only to find myself at home curled up in the fetal position watching Temple in the dark. Indiana takes a backseat to Short Round (played by Jonathan Ke Quan - greatest living actor of our generation) as Harrison Ford finds himself second fiddle to a 12 year old taxicab driver from Shanghai.<br /><br />Indiana joins forces with a night club singer named Wilhelmina \\"Willie\\" Scott and the aforementioned Short Round. Together, the 3 heroes wind up in a small distressed Indian village, where the locals believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after the sacred Shankara Stone was stolen! I have decorated my house with dozen Shankara Stones and believe you me, they indeed have power! My home has survived earthquakes, mudslide and forest fires and all praise goes to the power of the Shankara Stones. Indy, Willie, and Short Round discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding Pankot Palace, which is a booby-trapped ghoulish temple known as our beloved Temple of Doom!<br /><br />Temple of Doom defines my existence and has transformed life and saved me from ruin. Shankara Stones will make you believe in the power of Thugee. Watch this movie and perhaps it will change you in ways only you could dream of. Oh, what a cinematic feast for the ears & eyes you have made for us Mr. Steven Spielberg, what a feast indeed!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|First time ive ever reviewed a book but in this case agree with most of those giving 1 and 2 stars. Poorly written , repetivite , bad characters, cheesy and the list goes on. Its insulting to us women that people refer to this book as &#34;mummy porn?&#34; and that we women are flocking to it! WTF! Over rated , silly and not worth reading. Only the author is smiling who's made his money and 5 stars to the publisher for knowing millions of desperate women will read this porn version of mills and boon! Grrr
B000GJPL1S|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since it was in the theater. Now I can view it whenever I want on the device of my choice.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Definitely a game my son and I can enjoy together... I wish things were a little cheaper tho. There are many things he wants to have in his village but I don't like having to pay cash to make it happen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great mobile source of the greatest book in history! At your fingertips and right there on your phone. Thank you for this wonderful app.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Seemingly, many unanticipated endings. A good novel that's difficult to put down. Perfect book to read during an long airline flight.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|When major studios restore the classic titles in their vaults AND transfer them to disc from masters scanned in ultra-high resolution, they are demonstrating to us that they have learned from film experts and the general public that shoddy efforts at releasing these products in higher resolution formats in the recent past (DVD, now Blu-Ray) will be protested, and worse, not purchased, when news of their poor quality is emblazoned on the Net, and in Amazon reviews.  The studios now know that they must PROTECT THEIR INVESTMENT in the films whose rights they control. May they never forget this fundamental lesson. And we, the movie-loving public, have a duty to PURCHASE the initial product of these restorations, that have been so carefully, and expensively performed, in order to reward them for these efforts!<br />Sure, 4K is the digital approximation of chemical film resolution, and Blu-Ray currently \\"only\\" displays at 1080p native resolution on our current HDTVs. But aren't these restorations BEAUTIFUL and amazing to experience now? Support these truly loving efforts at restoration by BUYING them!<br />Creating this master makes it possible to transfer to still-unavailable future viewing formats with even higher resolution. Will we buy that version of the film we love, though we own the Blu-Ray today?  That is our choice to make--but I am so happy that the choice will now be possible, due to the creation of these ultra-high resolution masters!<br />UPDATE 7/22/12: \\"Singin' In the Rain\\" Blu Ray has been mastered from the second-generation Technicolor preservation positive which was scanned and restored in 6K (as the original negative was destroyed in the Eastman fire in 1978)
0985114606|3.0|Okay, like most people here I was a Fifty Shades fan. Shocked? I also saw the similarities including not really enjoying the first book, but still have plans on reading the second to give it another shot. That's when I \\"fell in love\\" with Christian and I am going to assume that's when Gideon will win my heart. I kind of feel that we did not learn too much in this book even though it is 300+ pages but the author needs to save something for the following novels. I predicted very early the dark secret Eva held inside, and assumed what Gideon's are even though we do not learn yet. What I say is give the book a try it is decent. I would have given the first 50 1 or 2 stars but rate 50 Darker and 50 Freed 4 or 5 stars, so just wait and see for the next novel. It's the same obsessive, rich, billionaire, bachelor who doesn't do the whole romance thing but changes his mind when we meet the heroine we try to relate to cult books that are popular right now.
0307592731|1.0|maybe it's because i'm not a woman, but my mind has been blown by all of the rave reviews i've seen written about this book.  i love tales of outdoorsy adventures and was initially excited to read this as i had recently read [[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail]], but i found this book to be quite trite and a rather large bit of shite.  all of the characteristics you would expect from a trail hiking book/memoir penned by such a terrible writer are included:  inexperienced aspiring woodswoman thinks a walk in the woods along a major american hiking trail will be an easy way to get away from it all and cure what ails her-in this case to help her get over her mother's death and escape her drug life (does it get any more cliche than that), sets off with way too much gear and an overly ambitious schedule, meets a few characters on the trail that help her come to a degree of acceptance over aforementioned things that ailed her-it should be noted that the only development the author provides for these supporting castmates are her ruminations on their suspected sexual prowess, lives happily ever after and even revisits the final scene of the book with her husband and children several years later.<br /><br />that's all i can bear to say at the moment as i'm getting furious and frustrated all over again as i sit here and relive reading this book.  trust ol' papa bender, your money will be better spent on bryson's book or even  [[ASIN:0897328493 Just Passin' Thru: A Vintage Store, the Appalachian Trail, and a Cast of Unforgettable Characters]]about a vintage store along the appalachian trail.<br /><br />cheers
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am an avid epic fantasy reader. I have been reading low cost e-books for the past six months and have found quite a few interesting and fun books. Most I would rate 2-4. I was curious when I saw the many positive reviews for Raven's Shadow (Blood Song. Based on the reviews I bought the book. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan wrote a great first book in this saga, and I am hooked on his style of writing. I will watch for future books by this author and read anything else he writes to see if this was a fluke. My guess is that Anthony is the real deal.<br /><br />Some reviewers had trouble with the editing and spelling, but as far as I am concerned, the storytelling is the important thing. This was a well told story. The characters were interesting, the pace was consistent, and the story left me hungry for the next book. Good Job by the author.<br /><br />This is a must-read if you like Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie, and similar authors. Buy this book. It is a bargain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game but ad pop ups after every game is alittle annoying but didn't start right away but I like the games
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Better/cheaper than the gps that sell together with Microsoft Street & Trip . It is recognized and integrated faster into my laptop/netbook than other products. Definiteley will buy again for another laptop.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|These headphones work awesome when you first buy them.  There is a problem with background noise on a PC but just turning the game volume down gets rid of it.  As said, these work fine for about a month.  For me, the left earpiece cut out a week ago.  Then today the right cut out.  I'm assuming its faulty wiring because if you tilt the cords just right they'll start to work again.  But you have to hold in, what could be, an extremely awkward position to hear.
B005FMZWD8|2.0|Bought this watch after I saw that it was on sale for 100$ reduced from 695$. Never heard of Invicta before, researched a bit about the company and found out it was made by Swiss clock mechanics and the design is a Russian diver's design.<br />I received the watch with a very impressive box, catalog (the catalog was a general one with explanations on all the different models of Invicta watches, which I found awkward since I only bought one specific model. Why would I want irrelevant information on watches I didn't purchase?).<br />Anyway, the watch part was very impressive to me, pretty big, but that's why I bought it in the first place. I noticed the band was pretty simple and looking and feeling compared to the metal part of the watch. I liked the inside of the band, which is made leather.<br />I got some compliments from my peers at work, even convincing my boss to buy one.<br />After about a month I began seeing the bands wearing out even though there I didn't do anything unusual to make them decompose the way they did (I showered with the watch only once the whole time I wore it). The leather began smelling funky, but that's expected from a leather interior band. I had hit my left hand (the one with the watch) on a 0.5mm thick glass and the watch face shattered! I brought the watch to its demise after I entered a pool with it because I thought that the watch screen was much thicker and that water would not enter the inside. Well, I was wrong.<br />I usually don't write reviews but I had to share this information this time because I want to give people my experience before the pay (or waste) 100$ for a watch that doesn't last too long.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Little did I think that Fiona could outdo her last endeavor, but this one is an instant classic. This fine album could have been made any time during the last century. It's based upon the most eclectic of folk, jazz, and classical musics. Fiona's piano playing is especially pleasing. Her technique is just too much. I played piano for 10 years but I simply don't have her staying power and consistency. Her lyrics, again, are most impressive. I simply love the deluxe artifact version, as her artwork renders her a modern-day da Vinci.
0345803507|5.0|I have to admit this series sucked me in.  I got the first book at the airport because my flight was delayed and almost finished the book at the airport.

0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games series was an awesome read.  All three books kept you in suspence the whole time.  I read all three books in 6 days, that was a first for me.  I would definitely recommend these books.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|War Horse is the kind of movie that tells an in depth story about a horse and the many people who happen to share the life of that horse during a turbulent period when the world was at war. The story starts with the birth of the horse and follows its development as it grows and begins to learn the life lessons it will need to survive.<br /><br />The pace is relaxed and the scenery is lovely as the viewer follows the series of events that shape the lives of the horse and the people who love and appreciate the horse. Things take a turn for the turbulent when England is plunged into World War I. No one was prepared for what was about to happen, neither man nor beast.<br /><br />Events quickly move across the English Channel to the battlefields in France where the viewer is exposed to the extremes of life in battle situations. The story follows the events that surround the horse and one sees the concerns expressed by most that come in contact with the horse.<br /><br />There follows some intense scenes that will be disturbing to the sensitive involving both man and animal. The brutality of warfare is shown to impact all equally.<br /><br />The ending of the movie brings closure and a resolution of the major tension of the movie, the relationship between the boy and the horse he loves. Although the movie is rated PG-13 I would advise caution especially with more sensitive audience members. It is a fascinating insight into life during the era of World War I but it has some disturbing moments.
B00637HXNG|5.0|Great concert.  3D is amazing.

1612130283|3.0|For some reason this summer, I have had a hard time finding a book that I could really whip through. I found \\"50 Shades\\" definately fit the bill. I agree with everything other reviewers have said about the lack of writing skills... Holy cow, jeez, rolling eyes all seem to be completely overused expressions. Here's a quick rundown of my thoughts on the first book:<br /><br />What I liked:<br />The story definatly moved along. This was a quick read and it kept you wanting to find out what happens next.<br />I like the basic plot behind the story -- what will people do for love<br />The e-mail exchanges gave us much more insight into the thought process of the two. I found the exchanges witty and enjoyable.<br /><br />What I found ridiculous:<br />Really - Christian who has grey eyes just so happened to be adopted into the Grey family? Isn't that just a little too convenient?<br />No college graduate is without knowledge or ownership of an e-mail address, smart phone and computer.<br />We are somehow supposed to believe that Ana transforms from a geeky girl into some sort of beautiful sex goddess in a matter of days/weeks? What, did she just take off glasses and get a new hairdo? It was a little too fairly tale and trite.<br />Ana climaxes every time? Give me a break!<br />What mother who cares even a little about her child would not attend a college graduation just because her husband hurt his arm??<br />What college student (with a part time job) can afford to just up and decide to fly across the country at the last minute?<br />When does this multi millionaire ever work and what is his company about?<br />He seems too accomplished to be 27 years old.<br /><br />What I found boring:<br />Phrases like Holy cow, jeez, rolling eyes, biting lips CONSTANTLY<br />The sex scenes got boring about 3/4 of the way through<br /><br />What I would have liked to see:<br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />After chapter three I was convinved we were soon to learn Christian had been abused as a child and was suffering from multiple personality disorder (or whatever it's currently called). It seemed obvious that his 50 shades described various personalities. I can not belive no one else has mentioned this in the reviews but the signs in the writing are so obvious ie his personality changes after be blinks. What about the crack whore mother? How did he hook up with Mrs. Robinson?  There's so much rich material here that the author could have explored to give us more insight into this tortured soul and what drives him to be the way he is. I envision occasional flashbacks of Christian's early life periodically woven into the story to give him depth. As it is, we are left to fill in the empty spaces. Maybe this will all be explained in the future books. I hope so because it could take a mediocre story and turn it into something really remarkable.<br /><br />I have the second book and will likely read it just to see if it actually gets into the story and explores the main characters. I'm not holding my breath, so I'm hoping to be surprised.

0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown was one crazy, crazy man. One I would've loved to know. He lived a life without fear, he did what he needed to do, and fought for the chance to do over and above what everyone else thought he could do. He beat drugs, and he beat handicaps becoming one of the top Navy Seals.I can't even begin to fathom being remotely like this man. And his wife? Her life was just as crazy, yet she never complained. She stood by his side, and did what she did to help him on his journey. Adam always said her job was harder than his.<br />  The book was so well written and through it I came to feel like I knew Adam and his family. Like I was there. I cried at the end. But even though the book and the life of Adam Brown have ended, his legacy will live on. No question about it. I love the fact that I have a copy of this book, the records the life of such a dedicated, fearless man.<br /><br /> I received this book for the purpose of this review from waterbrook multnomah publishing company.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Skeptically I bought this book, expecting it to be another drawn out, runner-geek, inspirational book, with a lot of fad-argumentation about running form and shoe-choice and spiritual-mental drivel about running....(you know, your typical trying-to-put-into-words-what-I-feel-when-I-run garbage that most of the accomplished runners with a book deal write).<br />But this book was truly different. First of all, it was very well written, and the stories were, not only interesting but, very well told.<br />The book introduces the reader to the ultra-marathon sub-culture (which is a thread in my selection of non-fiction books I love: books that introduce you to the very interesting characters and ethos of sub-cultures in specialized fields of endeavor).<br />Its characters are very interesting, real and well depicted. As is typical in these types of books, the writer starts out as an outsider with a mild personal interest in the subject, immerses himslef in the discipline and becomes one of its great participants.<br />I highly recommend the book to runners and to non-runners, and so much so that I have bought several copies to give out to many friends as gifts.
0345803485|1.0|Real rating is a big fat ZERO. This is without question the worst book I have ever attempted to read. Sooo boring. I was hoping for a sexy, suspenseful read. Haha!! got a lot Wow! Woah! Double crap! PPPPllllleassse!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|SUCH a great story.  A thousand plot twists, none of which you see coming.  Written from the point of view of a man and his wife, and I'd swear that a man wrote the man's side, a woman the woman's side. Each character knew things about their gender that I don't think the rest of us were ever aware of.<br /><br />A stunning success of a novel.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The story is unrelateable and unlikeable. The author definitely has  low self esteem or that is her targeted audience. The &#34;Heroine&#34; is a brainless, whiny bimbo. The book was a waste of my time and money. The plot was a joke and predictable. Don't waste your money.

I like her personalty in the movie. I'm not too crazy about Emma Thompson. She looks really bad in this movie. I know that is the way she is suppose to look, but I think she needs to grow her hair long again and throw out the lesbian look. She looked really nice in Junior.

1400052181|4.0|As a non fiction book it was a very interesting read to learn more about the topic since it has had such a huge impact on the world and almost every major medical advancement since the late 1950s, which is profound. There are two parts to this story, one being the impact of the cells themselves and what they did for the world and medical community. But the other side of the story, the more human aspect is how Henrietta Lacks family dealt with the news and what their lives were like. I think it was interesting from that perspective alone to see what this African American family went through, especially the earlier part of their lives was an interesting story to hear about.<br /><br />The science aspects of the book were certainly interesting to read about, since I have never had any exposure or interest in this subject I knew nothing about it before this book. I enjoyed learning about how things such as the polio vaccine were only possible after this discovery. The author did a very good job of not making it overly technical that average people such as myself could not understand it.<br /><br />The other part of the story which was intertwined was that of Henrietta's family and how this seemingly innocent 'donation/removal' at the time went on to plague her family for decades. Her family had absolutely no knowledge of these cells and their existence that part of their wife and mother went on living for decades. Which also opens up an interesting debate, should they have gotten any profit from these cells? Without them where would the medical community be today? Meanwhile her family was so poor that they could not afford health care or insurance for themselves to get any benefit from the cells.<br /><br />The author did a great job of befriending the family to learn more about Henrietta the person and not just her cells of finally giving her a face and a name which the scientific community had in essence robbed her of for decades. Her family had a great deal of distrust for not only the author but for others that were trying to make a profit off these cells and they had to deal with the consequences from that perspective and overcome their own personal struggles. I think a good way to summarize this book is by quoting the description: \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.\\" It's certainly not a 'light' beach read where its a cliffhanger or anything like that but it is very interesting subject to learn more about.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely fell in LOVE with this story. These books totally consumed me as I read all 3 in less than a week. I actually have been feeling depressed since I finished last night and am contemplating re-reading them! It really is that good. The characters are described in great detail to the point where you start to really know them and even feel like you are there with them. I grew completely obsessed with Christian and in awe of Anastasia. LOVE LOVE LOVE! 10 stars!! I hope the author makes a sequel.. :)
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|I have been using Andrew's sleep and relaxing apps daily for over a year. I use them to take naps when i work late/night shift and nightly to get to sleep. the quality and quantity of my sleep has drastically improved. I highly recommend this to everyone!!!
0439023521|5.0|I am shocked that people have been so critical of this story. This book gave me a new perspective on human conflict and the possibilities of becoming a writer that affords the reader the opportunity to engage in the story and become a first person participant in the actual events. While I was reading, I felt like I was part of the story, hoping to assist Katniss. The author painted an excellent visual portrayal of human conflict at the most primative, passionate, and challenging emotional levels.<br />I read this book in two sittings and each time I could not put it down. Yes, it was about teens;however, it brought out the most salient events of life in a demanding society. The best part of this story is that it provided insight into the main character's deepest thoughts about her conflicts. When I finished the book, I saw the trailer for the movie and I saw the story verbatim. It was just like the author wrote it. I could smell the aroma of the forest, I could feel the pain of their wounds, I could taste the foods and see the flowers. I was \\"transported to a place of escape it was like a vacation.\\" I did not want to finish this book. When I did finish the book I felt like I left behind one of the most resourceful friends I had ever met. I can not thank the author enough for this book. It was a reprieve from the world and it gave me hope - it is pure and colorful. I am now going to read the next one in the trilogy \\"Catching Fire\\", I am looking forward to reading and experiencing how Katniss interacts with everyone. Again, the author has given the world a gift to taste,touch,smell, feel, and observe - a totally sensory experience to savor.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Loved the Beegee's! So sad that most are deceased. Anyway wanted to have a remembrance of the brothers and their music. This CD fit the bill. Did not disappoint. I was very pleased with this product and was shipped right on time. Thanks Amazon!
0345803485|5.0|I heard about this book at work. All my female colleagues raved on about it. I'm not much of a reader, and being male, the book didn't appeal to me anyway.<br />I decided to send the Trilogy to my fiance to see what she thought, as I was curious and intrigued about the book. We live apart right now, so we have to talk a lot on the phone, emails etc.<br />she received the books 7 days ago, and I have barely heard a word from her since. She has a particular taste in books, so I'm guessing it's good. I managed to get a review from her... which consisted of giggles and no doubt, blushing. She said it was really good and can't wait for me to get back over there with her... hmmmm.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.

B002RHGYOA|4.0|The storyline is intriguing and interwoven well.  The Swedish setting makes for some hard reading ... cities, places and even character names are all untypical.  However, I skimmed over the finer details of how the characters were moving around the town and didn't feel as though I lost anything in the process.  Overall I enjoyed it enough to read the next book in the trilogy.

1936608898|5.0|I am and RN and I have read many nutrition books over the years because it is a special interest of mine. It Starts With Food is by far my favorite because it doesn't just tell you why you should eat a whole foods \\"paleo\\" diet but also gives you the how. I have tried the whole grains are healty approach - didn't work, I have tried the full fat dairy is best approach - didn't work...I didn't lose weight, I didn't feel great, I \\"cheated\\" because I craved sweets tremendously. When I eliminated dairy, grains, sugars, processed foods, legumes I also eliminated cravings, feeling the need to snack, and that muffin top I was always trying to disguise. My sleep became much more restful, my skin cleared. I could go on and on about my experience but really you have to try it for yourself. I don't think anyone should eliminate whole food groups from their diet unless they have a very good understanding on why they are doing it - It Starts With Food gives you this. I am much better equipped to make food choices now because I know EXACTLY how a particular food is going to affect me. Yes, I will treat myself occasionally to the things that I still love to eat - but I will be making an informed decision about what that food will do to ME. BTW I am an avid reader but I have never written a book review until now - that is how much this book meant to me!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I have been a hard rock/heavy metal fan for a long time now, and I was looking for something new.  I found this group when they were in a loudwire.com \\"cage match\\" with \\"In this moment\\".  They lost, but I think they were robbed!  I looked Halestorm up and was impressed, very impressed.  They are a good, solid act and this album is full of great songs with huge diversity.  There's a lot of Joan Jet in there, with some Pink and pinch of Pat Benatar (for the oldies like me).  This is a great band, with a really good album.  If you like loud, brash, female fronted rock, without it being a t'n'a album, or a harpy screech, this is for you.  I shall be keeping an eye on Halestorm in the coming years.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|W.E. is the story of socialite Wallis Simpson who possessed Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor enough that it prompted him to give up the throne of England to marry this woman.  This move caused quite a stir at the time for various reasons.  One of them was that Wallis left her second husband for him and she was an American.  She and this guy were celebrities, both immensely loved, vilified and ostracized by society all at the same time.  Who better to tell that story than someone like Madonna who is one of those rare people who has lived a life that most of the world will never have or experience.<br /><br />The movie paints a portrait of this love affair that took place juxtaposed with another story in modern day time revolving around another woman, Wally Winthrop.  Wally is a fictional character who is an abusive relationship and fixates on this love story between Wallis and the Prince.  She fantasizes and obsesses over it to the point of hanging out in a museum that is dedicated to the historical artifacts of Wallis Simpson.  The subplot could've stood on its own in another film, but not this one.  The way the movie jumps from the subplot to the affair between the Prince and Wallis is disjointed and confusing.  It also stalls the momentum.  The same was done in the Meryl Streep film, Julie & Julia.  Focus on the main public figure and avoid creating a fictitious subplot as it rarely works.<br /><br />W.E. does have a nice sleepy art-house feel to it and it will probably be more popular with Europeans who seems to have an appreciation for this genre.  I can't see very many Americans liking this film and then you have those who will simply ban, knock and criticize this movie after discovering Madonna is the Director.  You would never have guessed it watching this as it was pretty good.<br /><br />The movie is watchable and the attention to detail with the sets, costume design and actors is top notch.  Aside from the disjointed subplot, the movie gets so lost in the detail to the point where scenes drag longer than they need to.  All in all I was still pleasantly surprised as the movie picked up about mid way through up until the finish line.tail to the point where scenes drag longer than they need to.  All in all I was still pleasantly surprised as the movie picked up about mid way through up until the finish line.

B005NNVUBM|4.0|This is officially the most experimental album I have ever heard. The first disc is four songs long, but two are extended, so it is pretty long. The second disc is just... I have no words for the second disc. Experimentalism. Yeah, that works. Anyway, here's a track-by-track review.<br /><br />Disc 1 (Live Ummagumma)<br /><br />(5/5) Astronomy Domine - I love the original, but I love this more. It's been extended to over 8 minutes, with David & Rick sharing vocal duties.<br /><br />(5/5) Careful With That Axe, Eugene - This song was only available on the Point Me At The Sky single (not released in the US until Shine On came out), this is an 8 minute instrumental. Well, kind of. Roger whispers the song's name and then he screams bloody-murder while everybody goes crazy on their respective instruments.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun - Firstly, that's not even close to the longest song title on this album. Secondly, this is a good song, but loses half a point because it didn't really need to be extended. It's very quiet. The lyrics were taken from an old Chinese poem.<br /><br />(5/5) A Saucerful Of Secrets - This is weird. That's all. Great instrumental. Some parts are REALLY creepy though. Again, not the creepiest song on here.<br /><br />Disc 2 (Studio Ummagumma)<br />Before I start this, I'm going to say: The multi-part songs are counted as one song.<br /><br />(3.5/5) Sysyphus - This is about the weirdest instrumental ever. It starts with a very Roman-sounding drum beat, then changing to fast piano beat. Then everything falls apart. Rick starts banging on the keys, then it gets louder, and louder, and then animals start screaming, and then, just as it sounds like it's going to make your speakers explode, it goes back to that great opening. Not for casual listening.<br /><br />(3/5) Granchester Meadows - This is a peculiar piece. It sounds like it's just birds, meant to entice people with the way it travels from one speaker to the next. Not special or boring.<br /><br />(4/5) Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together (GASP) In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict - This song is really weird. Firstly, that's the longest name for a song I've ever seen. Secondly, it is exactly what it says it is. This is an avant-garde piece made up entirely of the band's voices played at different speeds & pitches to produce animal noises. The second part is basically Roger Waters yelling at you in Scottish. Thirdly, this is supposed to be - are you ready? A DANCE SONG. Just... what?<br /><br />(5/5) The Narrow Way - This song reminds of Echoes for some reason. It's the only one on the studio album with actual lyrics, and good ones at that.<br /><br />(4.5/5) The Grand Vizier's Party - A weird instrumental. Split into three parts - Entrance, Entertainment, & Exit - it is basically the music to a party. The third part is among the shortest songs in Pink Floyd's catalog (surpassed only by Stop at 0:31) at only 0:38, and is a flute solo.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age village looks like a fun and interesting game that is based on the funny and a little bit heart warming movies and it must be popular with the latest movie.
B000VH19CA|5.0|In Utero was made to alienate Nirvana's fanbase made by Nevermind by being filled with punk-sounding riffs and disturbing lyrics. This actually had to be edited to release it in certain stores.<br /><br />(3.5/5) Serve The Servants - The opener is very happy sounding for it's lyrics. It's basically Kurt's autobiography, with lines like \\"Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old,\\" and \\"I tried real hard to have a father but instead I had a dad.\\"<br /><br />(5/5) Scentless Apprentice - Based off a story about a perfume-shop worker who kills little girls and makes them into his own perfume, this brings on the disturbing lyrics that would standard for the rest of the album. This also makes the first medical reference (\\"Electrolytes smell like s***n!\\"). This song has one of my favorite riffs of all-time as well.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Heart Shaped Box - This was the only song off of In Utero to get a music video and the first single released. The chorus will be burned into your brain for years to come (\\"HEY! WAIT! I got a new complaint! Forever in debt to your priceless advice!\\"). It's actually pretty sad for the popularity of it. This also makes the second & third medical references (\\"Broken h***n of your...\\" and \\"Let out your u*******l noose so I can climb right back!\\").<br /><br />(5/5) Waif Me - Yes, this is not the title. But, I cannot say the title here, so I give you the glorious censored title (WAIF? Really?)! Anyway, the song is pretty un-radio friendly due to the verses and ending. The opening riff is actually Smells Like Teen Spirit played backwards and in a lower key. The demo began with a baby crying.<br /><br />(5/5) Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle - Long name, fantastic song. It may be weird, but it has a fantastic solo and great lyrics. Plus, it mentions Puget Sound :D!<br /><br />(5/5) Dumb - The first acoustic song has a very simple picking riff along with a cello. It became a radio hit but was never released as a single.<br /><br />(4/5) Very Ape - The first of what fans consider to be filler. Pretty nice, but way too short.<br /><br />(5/5) Milk It - My GOD this song is gross. Gross and weird. It begins with a clean jam session then shifts to a distorted riff, then goes back while Kurt strains out in a whisper the most disturbing song I have ever heard (\\"Her **** is my milk, my milk it is her ****), then goes to a very... interesting verse (\\"DOLL, STEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK! TEST, MEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT! LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF SUICIDE, LOST EYESIGHT I'M ON YOUR SIDE, ANGEL WING RIGHT WING BROKEN WING, LACK OF IRON AND OR SLEEPING!\\").<br /><br />(5/5) Pennyroyal Tea - This song is based off of a drug that supposedly causes something religious people don't like involving babies (FYI, the booklet says, \\"It doesn't work you hippie.). Great song with pretty somber lyrics and a great solo.<br /><br />(4.5/5) Radio Friendly Unit Shifter - That title is a pretty transparent reference to Smells Like Teen Spirit. The original title was actually Four Month Media Blackout. Anyway, this song is anything but Radio Friendly. Starting with a poly-cho laden high-pitched opening, then shifting to a bunch of dead notes, then going into the nonsensical verses (\\"Use it once & then destroy, invasion of our piracy\\"), and then going into the again nonsensical chorus.<br /><br />(5/5) tourette's - This, along with Dumb & All Apologies, debuted at Reading 1992. This song is pure punk-rock. Kurt plays a simple but loud riff over & over while screaming at the top of his voice with the only understandable lyrics being the bridge (\\"HEY! HEY! HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY! HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY! HEY!\\") and the end (\\"MEAN HEART! COLD HEART! <-- [repeat this 8 times] HEEEEEEEEEEEY! HEEEEEEEH! YEAH!\\")<br /><br />(4.5/5) All Apologies - Nice acoustic song. The end has electric overdubbing, which makes the end pretty hard to hear, but, in the words of Kurt Cobain, \\"Oh well, whatever never mind.\\"<br /><br />SECRET SONG!<br /><br />Yes, this album *had* a secret song. The MP3 version and censored Walmat version don't have it.<br /><br />(2/5) Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flowing Through The Strip - This is a 7 minute jam session with Kurt screaming out lyrics about his girlfriend getting pregnant and not having a date. Weird.
1936891026|5.0|This was a very motivating and thought provoking book.  It gave me an interesting perspective on myself and my ability to create and write. I took my time and really thought about the message of resistance. I now know the enemy and what I must do to overcome it so that I can be more productive. I am very touched by the last chapter in the book.  Create what you are meant to create don't let others and yourself lose out on what you were meant to do.  I highly recommend this book.

B0045HCJKS|4.0|One of the more entertaining selections of the early 1970's class of science fiction films ([[ASIN:B0003JAOO0 Colossus - The Forbin Project]], [[ASIN:B000P3GFWO THX 1138]], [[ASIN:B001QUM4IY Soylent Green]]), the 1973 thriller \\"Westworld\\" is a thought-provoking roller coaster ride. While glaringly implausible, the film is blessed by a great cast and the earnest work of writer/director Michael Crichton cutting his teeth for the first time.<br /><br />As most know, Crichton would go on to huge success with his [[ASIN:0345370775 Jurassic Park]] novels and the films that followed. Crichton was also competent behind the camera, directing the terrific [[ASIN:B0045HCJ8A Coma]] in 1977. This is essentially where it began, though Crichton had previously directed the made-for-TV political thriller [[ASIN:B0002KPHYM Pursuit]] and penned the excellent [[ASIN:006170315X The Andromeda Strain]], which in turn was directed by Robert Wise into one of the great sci-fi films in history ([[ASIN:B00008438U The Andromeda Strain]]). \\"Westworld\\" was a big hit, and I can vividly recall watching it at the theater amidst a packed house, with screams and applause as loud as anything seen at \\"Jaws\\" a couple of years later. Much of the audience participation was due to Yul Brynner's fine performance as the gunfighter. There is eerie menace to his robotic killer, replete with silver eyes and unwavering sneer, and it's just an unforgettable portrayal towards the end of a long career.<br /><br />A resort for the wealthy has been created where, for the mere price of $1,000 a day, attendees live out their fantasies amidst role-playing robots in Western World, Medieval World or Roman World. The film opens with vactioners flying across the desert by hovercraft towards the playground paradise. The expert casting of Richard Benjamin as Martin, recently divorced and on the rebound, and James Brolin as Blane, his rugged bachelor friend, boosts the film. Likable actors in their prime (at one time, Brolin was groomed to be a major star), they are a perfect fit for their roles, eagerly anticipating living out macho fantasies in Western World. Upon arrival, they don western gear and six shooters and check in at the local saloon. This is Blane's second trip, and Martin, still getting used to the resort dynamic, orders a dry martini. Blane humorously covers for him, \\"Just bring him whiskey, he's new in town.\\" Their adventures, including shootouts, jail breaks and enjoying the \\"services\\" of the robotic saloon girls, are inter-cut with scenes of additional visitors partaking in similar treats.<br /><br />The beauty of \\"Westworld\\" is you'll fantasize about visiting such a resort, not to mention which world to choose - sword play, toga romance or dusty grit? I'm not sure if there would even be a Western World today, but in 1973 \\"Gunsmoke\\" was still playing prime time. Indeed, in \\"Westworld,\\" the frontier town Blane and Martin stroll into is very much like a bad episode of the television series. When Martin encounters Brynner's gunfighter (patterned after his [[ASIN:B0011XF81G The Magnificent Seven]] character), he's provoked into shooting him dead. Amazed at the bloody reality, he questions whether Brynner was another park attendee, but is told while the guns are real, they have sensors making it impossible to fire at humans. Okay, but what about bullets that ricochet? What about the humorous barroom fight when chairs are broken over backs and attendees punched by robots? Someone would be hurt and litigation would rule the day. A few tweaks to the script could have ironed out such implausibilities, even if saloon fights were a staple of TV westerns and a few John Wayne films.<br /><br />As anyone who viewed the colorful film poster knows, robot control is eventually lost and, like those dinosaurs in \\"Jurassic Park,\\" they begin killing tourists. This is set up during obligatory board room scenes when scientists discuss a growing machine virus causing increased malfunction. A tourist is wounded and park supervisors immediately shut down electricity. This does not stop the robots, now running on battery power. It's a bit too pat, and Benjamin's Martin is again face-to-face with Brynner's intimidating robot itching to shoot him dead. I love the scene where Martin rides upon a panicked park technician (Steve Franken) and is told Brynner's model is indestructible, \\"There's nothing you can do. You haven't got a chance!\\"<br /><br />The prolonged, seemingly hopeless chase between the gunfighter and Martin is suspenseful, highlighted by excellent electronic music and computer effects of the gunfighter's POV (the first time such graphics were used in a film). Legendary director John Carpenter has said the intimidating nature of Brynner's gunfighter, not to mention his calm, strolling pursuit after a panicked Martin, inspired his Michael Myers character in [[ASIN:B000RIWAVW Halloween]].<br /><br />\\"Westworld\\" is a fascinating idea. While not fully realized, thanks in part to MGM's contemporary penchant for cutting days and dollars off the budget hours before filming, it moves at such a galloping pace you're willing to forgive it's strained logic. They say a remake is in the works with none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger as the gunfighter. If it's ever made, I'll certainly buy a ticket.

I'm recommending it to everyone I know who has a fire!
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|To start out, After 1000 suns i was nervous about this album, but Linkin Park came out with some good songs. Most aren't that good, but a few are alright, so it's passable.<br /><br />Maybe 3 songs are good and 2 are catchy.<br /><br />Good Songs:<br /><br />Lost In The Echo- 9/10<br />It has a good beat to it and does feel like a good rock song. i just wish they could've found a was to rock out with it more.<br /><br />Lies Greed Misery- 7/10<br />Again nice beat to it, but not enough rock. I also wanted Chester to say something more, but that never happens<br /><br />Victimized- 8/10<br />Awesome song, but has 2 problems with it. Too much simplicity and it's one of the shortest songs ever. I mean they couldn't have added more lyrics to it? Come on. I get it that he does scream a lot, but he screams more in Given Up, so why not make it longer?<br /><br />In My Remains- 5/10<br />Good song, but something annoys me about it i dont know why<br /><br />Castle of Glass- 6/10<br />This song is nice, but i wouldn't download it. But i can listen to it a lot though, it has an awesome beat and the lyrics are nice.<br /><br />The rest of the songs i can't possibly review because they are too bad for me, which brought my personal thought of this album lower and dissapointed me.<br /><br />Overall- 6/10<br />Living Things proved to me that Linkin Park can still make some nice songs, even though i miss the days of Meteora. Sigh... I think and hope their next album will be awesome, but we will have to wait and see in 18 months. Welcome back Linkin Park

I thought that someone was wrong with me as a person and this book help me realize why I struggle and how to reach the goals I set for myself. Not just a book to read, but there are exercises throughout that really work and help if you try. I'm so happy I purchased it, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I enjoyed this film. The actors were great. The clothing was beautiful and Italy blows my mind.  My family was there when they were filming the Tourist and they  took me to the movies with them to see it. I liked it so much that ordered the DVD. I was not disappointed
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|A disappointing ending to the trilogy as the characters and their compelling relationshiips were subverted, I think, by  explosions, unconvincing chase scenes, and a forced conclusion.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Having never read the late Stieg Larsson's [[ASIN:0307949486 2005 source novel]], an unforgivable oversight I know, I didn't know what quite to expect with this 2011 crime drama beyond what I already knew of director David Fincher's generally dark-hued work ([[ASIN:B001H1SVO8 Fight Club]], [[ASIN:B004HWT6DO The Social Network]]). For instance, I didn't know the film's narrative would be bifurcated until the midpoint of its 158-minute running time. One side of the movie belongs to the girl of the title, Lisbeth Salander, a deadened goth-punk computer genius, and the other side belongs to Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist whose latest expos&eacute; of corporate evil about a billionaire Swedish magnate has been declared libelous. Disgraced and broke, he accepts a private investigation job offered by Henrik Vanger, an elderly industrialist who would like to resolve the 40-year-old mystery of his murdered niece Harriet in the Swedish hinterlands up north. The list of suspects, Blomkvist is told, includes several members of Vanger's dysfunctional family, eccentric fascists and Nazis still living within walking distance from his manor.<br /><br />Obviously, as Blomkvist gets closer to the truth, his life becomes more endangered. Juxtaposed with Blomkvist's investigation is Lisbeth's unenviable existence back in Stockholm. Having just compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Vanger, she has just been appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, due to her state-declared mental incompetency. Bjurman abuses his authority by forcibly raping her. Lisbeth eventually regains control of her life by blackmailing him in the most degrading manner possible, an act of revenge both horrifying and satisfying. Blomkvist decides to hire Lisbeth to help him uncover the connection between a cryptic message written in a notebook and a series of murders that occurred from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. The labyrinth plot escalates into a series of increasingly revealing connections between Harriet's disappearance and the entire Vanger dynasty, in particular, Harriet's brother Martin, now the CEO of the Vanger Corporation, and their estranged sister Anita, living in London with no desire to reunite with what remains of her family in Sweden.<br /><br />At the same time, Lisbeth and Blomkvist become romantically involved, which naturally brings its own set of complications but also provides the impetus for a final act of revenge. I assume screenwriter Steve Zaillian's adaptation of the source novel remains faithful, but just as important, he manages to present an elaborately plotted thriller with most of the necessary details presented intact. Fincher does an impressive job propelling this complicated story with dazzling cinematic technique and handles the more lurid moments with the same professional ease he displayed in [[ASIN:B00464F19Q Se7en]] and [[ASIN:B000VK7KVQ Zodiac]]. However, the meticulous emphasis on procedure sometimes disinfects the movie to the point of making the principals feel more like plot devices racing toward the resolution. At certain points, the plot developments feel as cold as the wintry Scandinavian setting. Despite this tonal discord, the cast works effectively within the story's convolutions and conventions. Even with a variable Swedish accent, Daniel Craig is able to submerge his cool Bond persona just enough to play the wry, middle-aged investigative reporter in a compellingly human manner.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer as Vanger, Joely Richardson as Anita, and Robin Wright as Blomkvist's married editor Erika all play their roles with precise authority and surprisingly convincing Swedish accents. In more challenging roles, Yorick van Wageningen as Lisbeth's abusive guardian and Stellan Skarsgård as Martin are even better. However, it's Rooney Mara (Mark Zuckerberg's scabrous girlfriend in the opening scene of [[ASIN:B004HWT6DO The Social Network]]) who really gives the movie both its mystique and emotional wallop. With pale eyebrows, shapeless clothing, and awkward manner, Mara's Lisbeth concurrently craves attention and deflects it with almost every movement. The actress makes her character's savant skills and photographic memory perfectly believable and most of all, makes Lisbeth's seeming passivity quietly heartbreaking with a modicum of expression. It's a superb, star-making performance. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth deserves mention for capturing the severity of the chilled images needed to convey the story, while the original music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provides an appropriately haunting undercurrent.wallop.

0142501123|5.0|This is a wonderful, adventurous, funny, colorful and silly story that makes anyone laugh, smile and kids to read it again and again and again. I can't wait to read them to my son!.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|If you're looking for a simple game of &quot;find the hidden item&quot; this will hit the spot. Its got a ghostly storyline to go with it - nothing too spectacular, but its entertaining. A little difficult to spot the items on a small phone screen, but its a decent way to kill time.
B0086700CM|1.0|it boring. at first I thought. it was fun. but it terrible. it a true opinion just. saying .do not get it .
B007O3QC8K|5.0|We saw this concert performed live at Carnegie Hall. The recording is eloquent,<br />shimmering -- a touching and enduring performance. Bravo.
0547569653|5.0|By far, this book is in my top 3 for favorites. Although I am not a vegan, I did try some of his recipes and loved them. While reading, the book forced me to really look at not only my running, but my life as a whole...what I was doing, where I was going, etc. Changed me for the better!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is the most creative, challenging and intellectually satisfying game I've ever played ... right up there with chess and bridge, but more relaxing at the end of a busy day.  Was it created by Zen masters?  There is a meditative quality about it: many possible solutions to most puzzles, but only one that's &quot;perfect!&quot;  No physical dexterity required (as there is with &quot;Angry Birds&quot;), so we geezers are not at a competitive disadvantage against our grand kids, but it may be just as addictive.<br />&quot;PopRuh&quot;
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was awsome. It's one of those books that when you start reading it you don't want to stop...I stayed up many nights till 2:00 reading...almost falling asleep.  Ending was total surprise !
B007YQAYDG|5.0|I bought this album today and have listened to it twice already. I can't remember the last time that happened. It's just hauntingly gorgeous. Lush classic soul orchestration, a 70s singer songwriter vibe and a touch of African phrasing in the vocals hinting at Kiwanuka's Ugandan heritage. This isn't reto, it's timeless.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Lots of twists & turns.Best of the three books.kept my interest throughout.Just a little disappointed with the ending.Recommend everyone reads it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An amazingly terrific book. After reading the first book in the trilogy, I immediately picked up the second, Catching Fire. Just like the first, I could not put it down. The ongoing climax is enough to draw in any reader. I would recommend this book to any reader! One of my new favorite authors.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So sad it is over...my love affair with this series.  It was a great, light, fun, very sexy, summer read and I miss Christian Grey and Ana Steele.  I highly recommend this series. Have fun..I might re-read it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This story SERIOUSLY reminded me of twilight, which is just sad. Who would want to copy something so flawed? However, I did enjoy it as a completely non-serious quick read. I might buy the second one just because it's something I can read without thinking too seriously about. The story does narrate what I feel I've been going through in the past few months, minus some horribly thought out details from the author. I, too, have fallen for a man who can't/doesn't know how to love back. Skipping on some details about that in particular, I feel that 'Ana' is another Mary Sue (A quick google search of that should give you plenty of information on what a Mary Sue is). More attention is given to Mr. Grey than to Ana herself. And Mr. Grey is far too perfect. I'd rather have some flaws, just so I'd know he's human. Again, as a quick read without looking too deep into it, it's not bad. The BDSM part is majorly flawed, as you can investigate through discussions about such matters. Does this book deserve best-seller? Compared to some of the smut that makes it there, maybe. But it doesn't deserve the rave it's getting. Save that for something better than a story that was a fanfiction of twilight with some name changes.
0965750892|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend at work. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />The style reminds me slightly of the first chapter or two of Joyce's \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\"  The author effectively captures the mindset of his main character, an autistic child who is obviously high functioning.<br /><br />The plot is mildly disappointing.  The mystery is revealed in a confession.  I found myself disappointed that the revelation didn't result in a greater change in the main character.  But, I don't want to reveal too much.<br /><br />Other reviewers seemed to focus on whether the portrayal of autism was realistic.  I think this is a non-starter.  The point wasn't to accurately portray autism, I don't think.  Besides, there are probably as many forms of autism as there are austistics.  I found this particular protagonist believable.  The author manipulated my expectations and desires to achieve quite a bit of tension and interest.<br /><br />I recommend the book.
0545265355|4.0|Getting all 3 of these hardcover books at this price makes it hard to pass up.  The only reason I give it a 4/5 stars is because the actual \\"box\\" in this \\"Boxed Set\\" is made out of cardboard.  When ordering a box set of books I expect the box to be of slightly higher quality.  Also why not include things like a bookmark or the mockingjay pin?  Overall these are great books at a great price.  If you plan on getting these books this is the best price I have found.
0312933541|3.0|I am definitely a Jeffrey Archer fan, but I thought this book was just ho hum.  It is definitely not one of his better books, although an enjoyable read.  Archer took his normal two main characters and intertwined them through the plot of the story.  But in this particular book, you found that you were continually pulling for the good guy and hating the predictable bad one.  At the end, you find that good always triumphs over evil, but at the cost of several good, innocent lives.  And the very end is a letdown.  I'm glad to see that Mr. Archer's books are much better than this particular one.
B001IAME78|4.0|this is my favorite hulk movie.  They did Hulk perfect.  The Hulk in the Avenger's movie is a little ape-like but was also good.  Norton's banner was great, but the Banner in the Avenger's movie was fantastic.  Ang Lee Hulk and Banner were fun but my least favorite of the three.  I also like Liv as Betty best.<br /><br />My least favorite character was mr. Blue, he was too two dimensional
B007N85ZXY|1.0|Yikes!<br /><br />This is almost as painful as watching Willy Mays in the 1973 World Series. If the this the future......
0525423656|2.0|I should begin by saying that I did not love Matched. Crossed begins pretty exciting, but towards the middle the pacing slows down and once again it is a bit boring. Then at the end she makes it exciting and once again ends the book. I was reading other reviews on this book and one of them said this, \\"It's like Condie had enough material for 2 books but the publisher's wanted to squeeze out three, and Crossed resulted.\\" I, personally, disagree with this reviewer. I think that Condie had enough material for one book, but dragged it out into three. These books are quick reads though, and if you want fluffy books that attempt to be literary and, mostly, fail then go for it.

B005K17RU0|5.0|is an excellent program it is one app you should have well worth the effort to install and makes life easier.
B005LAII94|3.0|This isn't the first movie to come out this year to use this sort of narration, is it? Maybe \\"Fallen\\" is just coming to mind and that weak effort that left a sour taste in everyone's mouth reared its ugly head right from the start. But the familiarity slowly begins to wear off once O reveals her two lovers and what they do for a living. Speaking as someone who isn't really a fan of anything Oliver Stone has done, hopes weren't very high for \\"Savages,\\" but the trailers were at least intriguing. What you end up with is one of Stone's best efforts that is nearly tarnished thanks to a really feeble conclusion.<br /><br />The cast for this is ridiculous. Out of the three movies Taylor Kitsch has done this year, this is easily the best. He seems more focused as Chon and the character is more brutal than John Carter or Lieutenant Alex Hopper. Aaron Johnson is a bit more laid back. His best scene is when Ben kills for the first time and he completely freaks out afterward. Blake Lively doesn't really do anything different compared to what she did in \\"The Town\\" other than bang two guys on screen.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta don't really step outside their boundaries either, but the characters they portray are ones they do so well that you won't really mind. Del Toro is just outstanding and both characters are entertaining in this sleazy kind of way. Salma Hayek is the one people are talking about the most though. It seems like there's already early Oscar buzz around her role. Elena is emotional, compelling, and intimidating; three things all great and memorable movie villains should be.<br /><br />The soundtrack is literally all over the place, as well. It feels like it covers nearly every genre out there from 8-bit beats to industrial sounds, a full orchestra to dance music, hip hop tracks with Spanish vocals to piano, horns, and various different types of guitars. It's so different from everything else you've heard this year that it's difficult not to remember it.<br /><br />\\"Savages\\" is ridiculously good for about three-fourths of its duration; like borderline the top score of whatever you rate movies kind of good. The last twenty minutes or so completely ruins whatever it had going for it though. It's like \\"Breaking Bad\\" with pot instead of meth nearly the entire time. How do you screw that up? A really stupid ending practically destroys the whole deal.<br /><br />It's like everything was progressing smoothly during the production process and then when it came down to the ending, Oliver Stone just ran in the room, pushed everyone behind him, and said, \\"Step back, I'll take it from here, ladies and gents.\\" Then he proceeded to take this huge, drug-induced crap all over the finale and the smell nearly ruins the rest of the picture.<br /><br />It is just massively frustrating. There's this brilliant cast, some pretty intense torture scenes, tons of blood, this fantastic soundtrack, explosive action, and even this amazing scene in a car between Aaron Johnson, Taylor Kitsch, and John Travolta that's reminiscent of that infamous car scene in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" where Vincent Vega's gun accidentally goes off. But then the ending comes along and once the credits roll, you're just left with the overpowering urge to kick a cluster of helpless, unsuspecting baby seals to the moon.mber it.<br /><br />\\"Savages\\" is ridiculously good for about three-fourths of its duration; like borderline the top score of whatever you rate movies kind of good.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Knowing there are more books in the series, you will want to buy the whole thing!! The beginning seems to be a little  long but once you learn there really might be a story and wonder what is going to happen between these two!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just with the rest of the series, this book gets you deeper into the love story (if that is what you can call it) of Ana and Christian!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Awesome Book! A must read! I could not put it down! Travis and Abby are all over the place, but can't stay away from each other. It made me laugh and cry. Kudos to Jamie McGuire, I sure hope there will be more about Travis and Abby.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loaded this book onto my Kindle on July 4 and started reading. And didn't stop. Everywhere I went, the Kindle went, which meant I was sneaking in reading time when I was supposed to be paying attention to something else. Gone Girl is that riveting a read.<br /><br />Before I invested in the download -- you could get a couple of double lattes for $12.99! -- I read most of the reviews here. A lot of people loved the book but only gave it one or two stars because of the ending. I am stunned, but I'll get to that in a minute.  Why did I like it?<br /><br />* The writing is almost unfailingly crisp and witty. The story is told entirely in the first person(s). Even if the reader starts to question the veracity of the stories which, by the way, you can't help doing once you realize that the narrators may not be as reliable as you might hope, there is no disputing the individual clarity and consistency of the three first person accounts.<br /><br />* The twists. All right, it's a mystery/thriller, so you're going to anticipate a few corkscrew moments. But every time I thought I knew which direction we were heading, the story took a u-turn and scurried up a back road I hadn't even spotted.<br /><br />* The sendup of the missing wife ritual. From OJ to Lacey and Scott to the Powells, we all know by now: the husband did it. Who else would have the motive? It's just a matter of figuring out how/when/what, and no one will be surprised if no body appears because there are plenty of places to hide one. Since the husband in this story is also a narrator, it's easy to doubt his version of reality, especially when the plot begins to track the Scott/Lacey story a little too closely for my taste. Indeed we do catch him in some lies. But even the lies may surprise us. As an extra bonus, Flynn throws in a few parodies of talk show hosts, but since all the current authors seem to be on that particular bandwagon, the device has lost some of its potency.<br /><br />* The emphasis on appearance, and appearances. Nick and Amy, as we are told many many times in different ways, are both several standard deviations above average in looks. Beautiful people can get away with behavior that the rest of us can't, or maybe they can't get away with anything because everyone assumes they're using their attractiveness to manipulate everyone else. This theme is reflected in the focus on appearances: any given situation can be interpreted in a number of contradictory ways. And the first interpretation may be the false one. Or maybe not.<br /><br />As an aside, Amy's riff on women being their true selves rather than their faux \\"cool\\" selves was one of the most delectable moments in the book. It could have been omitted from the story without any harm, but it was just plain wonderful.<br /><br />* The ending. Okay, I know that a lot of people hated it. It's not a neatly packaged happily-ever-after denouement, like a made for tv movie.  If you need to have your mysteries resolved Agatha Christie style, you will be dissatisfied. But it's diabolical, it's clever, and it's the gun from act 1 that fires in act 3. There are many ways this book could have ended, and the author took a risk with this one, but if you're reading the book as a psychological thriller rather than as a police procedural, it's perfect.<br /><br />The book itself isn't perfect. There are a few plot deviations that nagged at me as I was reading. They're not material to the story or its outcome, just kind of sloppy. Because by the time I was 100 pages into the book, I knew Amy well enough to expect her to plan everything to the nth degree and was disappointed when she didn't, and I knew Nick well enough to know that he might do something really stupid but that he would at least think about what he was doing while he was doing it. Characters are allowed to surprise us, but they aren't supposed to step out of character.<br /><br />All in all,Gone Girl is a great and gripping way to pass a few hours. But try to pick it up before bedtime or you may not get to sleep until dawn.
034580404X|5.0|I didn't sleep for a week between working and staying up all night reading. I could not put these books down. What an awesome Love Story! I can't wait to see the movie! I hope Hollywood doesn't screw up to bad!
B00834PFC8|5.0|Exciting, witty, well acted and well written.  The first year was good, however, I really had to suspend my belief during the first episode, however, by the second one.....they had me.  I am a fanatic and can't wait until next season.  Pray there's another.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|downloaded this game (games) and couldn't put it down.  lots of options.  earning points is a pain -- that's why I'm writing a review --  earning points.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The information in this book is fantastic. The actual diet part is such a small piece, sandwiched around a lot of research and science. Fortunately, the book reads well and is not so full of detail that it gets boring. I enjoyed it, learned a lot, and best of all, have lost over 10 pounds in about 4 weeks using the approach. I still eat a lot of things I love and have not counted a single calorie, while still seeing great results.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game or these games a whole lot!! I hate the fact that you have to make a certain score on the game in order to pass and you only get twelve games at a time. It is really fun tho besides those minor set backs.
B0088TG252|3.0|Acting ,photography and locations were stunning. The plot line was thin and seemed contrived at times. I would not watch it again but it was worth watching.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally temple run has come to the fire. Ive been waiting and I find temple run so much fun. You must get it. I know temple run has been out for a while now but I decided to write a review late anyhow. Awesome game! so much fun!
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|I find nothing admirable or inspiring about a young man who tries to live off the land with no hunting skills and can't even live in the woods for 6 months. It is just progressive propaganda
B00785P2QC|5.0|The graphics are very good.  I love that you don't have to wait such a long time to build a building. it is like your on city. i think its a good game.
B005OOL1IC|4.0|The title says it all, rude crude and hilarious, a great movie if you enjoyed the first Hangover. Not quite as funny, but close.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a selection of my book club and I really enjoyed the story.  I enjoyed rooting for Victoria and trying to figure out the back story for the other major characters. The character development and revelation of their stories was engaging. Even though some of the story was a little predictable, the added element of the flower language was very intriguing. A great story of personal growth, love and triumph.
B006YZOXHQ|4.0|This is the movie Jane Fonda would just as soon have you forget she ever made. And it's a shame she regrets it, because \\"Barbarella\\" has become a cult classic. I'm sure she doesn't regret the residuals, if she's still getting them! This is a must-see, because whether she likes it or not, it's a classic.<br /><br />The movie is based on a French comic book character who conquers the universe with her feminine wiles. Along the way, she meets some interesting characters. There's Mark Hand, who looks after the ice and forests of Weir, and who rounds up the children who live there once they reach a servicable age. After he repairs her ship, she rewards him in a very special way. There's also Pygar, the blind angel, played by John Philip Law; The Great Tyrant, portrayed by Anita Pallenberg (Mick Jagger's girlfriend at the time), and Dildano, the leader of the revolution, played by David Hemmings. All of these characters make for a very enjoyable film that endured the test of time. And, I must say, Jane Fonda looks amazing. The acting is cheezy, as should be for a movie of this type; the special effects are equally tacky (lava lamp effects...not what you find in space), but it all works.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is very good. The colors are more vibrant and the high definition transfer makes details, missed in the standard DVD, stand out. I had to give this only 4 stars because they could have done something to improve the sound, which is highly compressed mono. Today's home theater systems are capable of much more, so uncompressing the sound would have been welcome. I can live with the mono sound, although Bob Crewe's music could have benefitted in stereo or 5.1 surround sound would have been nice.<br /><br />Finally, to Jane Fonda: Please don't sell this movie short. You shouldn't regret making it, because it showed your range as an actress. Being able to pull off a cheezy performance such as this, when we all know how great an actress you really are, and were atthe time, shows your abilities well. You never looked lovelier, and still do today. I'm a fan of your work, and I thank you.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|It is stupid to rate this game 1 star just because you think it's too hard. This is a great game with a good challenge.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I bought this game with high expectations and was completely disappointed.  The puzzles aren't difficult in themselves but you have to run around everywhere trying to figure most of them out unless you use the hint guide for everything.  Redeeming factor for it was that the graphics were very good.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is so cool! I just got my first Kindle Fire and of course tried I out all the free games. I still can't believe Temple Run is free! It is the best free game available! I love that the sensitivity is adjustable too so that it plays right with my screen protector on.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Nice little twist to the hidden puzzle games.  Certain lvls though are very difficult to finish without using hints, luckily though its very easy to pick up hints in the game.  Story line was pretty good to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just can stop reading, as soon I finish the first book I have to buy the second and then the third. I read them all in 3 Weeks
B00845PV16|2.0|Was a complete and total let down from the 1st movie.  Story line had potential, but you figure out real fast that this is not a Hollywood film.  Cage did an ok job on the movie himself, but like most of his stuff of late, it just seems he's putting out movies lately to get a paycheck and nothing else.  Most the actor in the movie are either nonames you've never heard of or my guess is they are Europian actors.  There were only 2 or 3 face I recognized.  I would deffinatly have to give this movie a c- on the B movie scale even.  It really was that bad.
0451196716|5.0|Out of all the King books I've read, this one ranks up there with the greats. It's not as long and enduring as The Stand, or It, but that's hardly a problem. This is one of those books you can read in a weekend. As soon as you start, it's hard to put down.<br /><br />The book offers a simply unique presence, 100 boys walk, until the last one stands. King's known for his imagination, and this book definitely stands out. It's not necessarily scary, but it's intense, and purely enthralling.<br /><br />You won't regret picking up The Long Walk. If I had to introduce Stephen King to anyone, this would be my book of choice.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I really did enjoy this game.  Only reason I couldn't give it 4 or 5 starts is becuase one of the puzzles is buggy.  When you get to the clock tower and have to set the times.  If you have a time that begins with a 0, most likely you won't be able to pass the puzzle.  I had to restart the entire game, luckily I had no 0 hour times so I was easily able to pass it.  Little bit of story line there is, is actually funny, and the puzzles are very interesting.  I Liked it alot once I got past the clock.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book. Very well writing, exciting plot, thought-provoking, great character developing. Good, fast summer read. One of the best new books I read recently.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|I like super hero movies, and after reading the synopsis on the movie, thought it may have potential.  WRONG!  First of all, the filming was done in the style of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Cloverfield\\".  Almost the entire movie was jumpy.  The actual story line was plausible but unfortunately the script was a total failure.  The little bit of action in the movie was a total failure as well, though I think some of that may have been due to the filming style.  The acting was surprisingly bad also.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The whole Game of Thrones series are a long, satisfying read. They incorporate elements of the medieval, combined with zombies, the fantastical, people brought back to life through magic, and on and on. Kind of a little bit of everything for everyone - the only problem is that the author spends years writing the next book in the series, but the wait is always well worth it!
034580404X|1.0|What a colossal waste of time and money! Ugg.  You call this erotica?? Gotta give her credit though, she did hire one hellava marketing team to sell this drivel. This was our book club choice this month and I should have stopped reading after the first chapter of book one. Repetitive, uninspired, and the weak attempt to turn this into a thriller was just plain lame. Try getting a job at the Judy Garland Museum, Ms. James, since you are so adept at using the phrase, \\"Oh my...\\"<br />Use your money to by Anais Nin's \\"Little Birds\\" or for D&S/bondage/spanking, check out \\"The Pearl\\" by anonymous (NOT the Steinbeck one). Those are a fun romp!
B005LAIGSC|5.0|I have  have a large collection of movies from Standard to HD & Blu Ray DVD's so need to be more selective on the Movies I buy these days and almost didn't buy Safe House on account expecting better reviews and after having seen this movie I thought it was a great spy thriller with action and excellent performances by Denzel Washington & R Reynolds ( Washington ) who plays the part of Tobin Frost one of CIA's  most dangerous traitors selling government info to the highest bidder who resurfaces in South Africa after a decade because he was being followed by other mescenaries trying to get a chip with all intel on spys traitors within the CIA & governments & so on taken to a safe house for further interrogation and the safe house is than being attacked by the same brutal mercenaries where rookie agent Matt Weston( Ryan Reynolds )is forced to take the infoumous T Frost ( D Washington ) on the run & as the master manipulator toys with M Weston ( R Reynolds )shaking the young operatives morality and idealism are being chased by the mercenaries and so the unlikely allies must fight to stay alive to uncover who wants them both dead withing the CIA .<br /><br /> This  movie is packed with intense action and thrilling suspense and the only thing I was a bit confuse within 9 minutes give o take of the movie one of the mercenaries shoots T Frost on the head( D Washington ) with a sniper rifle & collapses on the footpath and a boy searches T Frost ( D Washingtons )with eyes wide open as pedestrians walk past staring and on the next scene he was walking through an alley with the spy of MI6 who gave him the chip to begin with assuming they didn't kill him till they have the chip with all the info and regarding the Ultaviolet don't use it and one of the reasons haven't got my TV o Blu Ray players connected to the internet yet because of where I live so have Satellite instead ... I though Safe House is a Good Blu Ray Movie deserves a four but giving it a five for the acting action and thrilling suspence .and thrilling suspence .
0307719219|4.0|This book is based entirely on the simple yet provocative notion that the economic success of a country derives from the \\"inclusiveness\\" (the authors' word) of its political and economic institutions - basically, the extent to which a country makes political and economic opportunity broadly available to its population rather than discriminating in favor of controlling elites.<br /><br />This argument seems generally cogent to me, and is fairly well articulated.  It coincides with the observation that (except for certain oil-producing states), the per-capita GDP of nations is closely correlated to their corruption index as reported by Transparency International.<br /><br />I'm giving the book four stars because the thesis is sensible (though roundly ignored in economic and foreign policy circles) and, by and large, strongly presented.  However, the presentation suffers from a number of flaws, many of them discussed by other commenters:<br /><br />1.  The authors over-rely on proof by example.  Of course, socio-economics are not subject to replicable, controlled laboratory studies.  However, I think the authors repetitively cite multiple instances to prove their point as if to demonstrate that their thesis holds for the entire sweep of human history - given thousands of years of human development and over a hundred modern nations, that's just not possible.<br /><br />2.  As mentioned by many commenters, the authors repeat themselves.  A lot.  I agree that a good editor could have cut a hundred pages from this book with no loss of meaningful material.<br /><br />3.  [Warning - straying well into the realm of (I believe well-founded) personal opinion]  It appears to me that the authors' viewpoints with respect to certain countries, particularly Colombia and Brazil, are heavily colored by the political viewpoints of their contributors.  They cite Brazil as an example of a country with inclusive institutions.  However, Brazil rates a 3.8 on the 2011 Transparency International corruption index.  No OECD country ranks less than 4.0 and none of the \\"traditional\\" OEEC countries rank less than 6.0.  Brazil's 3.8 puts it in the same range as China (3.6), which the authors call an extractive state, and, yes, Colombia (3.4).  While its true that Brazil has true multi-party rule and a market economy, the huge level of corruption, bureaucracy and poor institutions, as well as the inability to enforce the rule of law in vast swaths of its urban areas, argue against listing it as a role model.  It seems to me that a better example in Latin America would have been Chile, which has the second best corruption perception in the Americas (7.2, better than the US with 7.1 but behind Canada with 8.7) and a higher GDP per capita than Brazil ($14.4k vs. $12.8k on a nominal basis, $17.4k vs. $11.8k if adjusted for purchasing power parity).<br /><br />Some commenters wish the authors had addressed the relative inclusiveness of major market democracies, for exmple comparing the US to certain EU nations or commenting on a potential decline in US inclusiveness.  Frankly, I'm glad they stayed away from it, as such an exercise would have become very political... while an interesting topic, I think it is best kept in blog posts, or perhaps a follow-on book.<br /><br />Overall, well worth reading despite its flaws.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|I've been using Splashtop for a while now and it has generally worked very well. A few areas could use improvement.<br />1. A few options so I could customize which features should be enabled would be nice. I don't like a couple of the modes and it would be nice to disable them.<br />2. Make it easier to bring up the keyboard. Actually an auto display here would be nice.<br />3. Easier access to the few options that are available. Freqquently I find I am tapping to bring up the options but the don't display.

0307730697|5.0|FEARLESS the story of Navy Seal Team SIX operator Adam Brown is a must read! I've long had admiration for our military and especially those who go above and beyond in their training. I knew they undergo situations to prepare for any and every possible circumstance; however I didn't have the slightest idea what they do endure.<br />Adam was raised by good Christian parents however he found himself spiraling down into drugs and a life of despair. With the help of God, family and friends he pulled himself out of that existence and went on to become a member of the elite Seal Team TWO. There he pushed himself to overcome further hindrances as he encountered physical situations that would have caused many, if not most, to quit. He went on to further qualify for the DEVGRU, Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or SEAL Team SIX.<br />Through it all Adam consistently showed a tender, compassionate side of himself. While in Afghanistan he saw Afghan children walking barefoot or in flip-flops and it was starting to snow. He contacted his wife and parents and asked them to get some shoes and socks. He distributed over five hundred pairs of shoes and socks to the children of Kunar Province.<br />I received this book free for a fair and honest review.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Being new to the \\"In Concert\\" presentations of musicals, I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />This was very well done musically and the staging was quite dramatic given that the cast were standing at mics for the most part. It was captured brilliantly on the recording.<br /><br />A bonus at the end were reprises of a couple of the show-stoppers with several UK companies and many members of the original 1985 company joining in.<br /><br />Of course Cameron Mackintosh banked this one as well but the production was really well done. Must have been magical to be there that night.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B005LAIGF0|3.0|\\"I know I was distracting you but I did see the bus go through the red light and I saw you hit that woman.\\" Lisa Cohen (Paquin) is a typical New York teenager. Doin OK in school and has a testy relationship with her mother. One day she goes out looking for a cowboy hat and after a few stores she is disappointed when she can't find one. By chance she notices that a bus driver (Ruffalo) is wearing one and she runs along side of the bus trying to get his attention. He smiles and waves at her, taking his eyes off the road and ends up running down and killing a woman. Trying to protect herself and the driver Lisa doesn't tell the truth in the report. That lie begins to consume her life and she is now bent on revealing the truth, but that sounds easier then it is. I have thought for awhile that when a movie starts to creep up on the 2 1/2 hour mark it better be worth it and interesting. I also think that some directors take the stance that the longer the movie the better the movie. This is not always the case. I open with that for a reason. This is actually a pretty good movie that deals with an interesting issue about a teenager dealing with a traumatic experience in her day to day life. The main problem with this is that it tried so hard to show how she was dealing with it that they couldn't decide what to cut out. So they showed just about everything. Unnecessary scenes of her at school and a whole sub-plot about her mother's stage play and boyfriend really took the focus off of the main reason for the movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie because it is worth watching, but it could have taken a lot out to give it the emotion that it should have. Overall, a decent movie but because of too much going on it was hard to stay focused and emotionally involved. Watch it and you will see what I mean. I give it a B-.

B004NOH9LC|1.0|After I did see The Notebook , I kind of fell in love in Rachel McAdams but this movie is a disaster. It is waster of 10 dollars and 2 hours time. I could not even see this movie in one shot..I had to pause and go back to my work on and off. Sheer waste of time and energy. Harrison Ford disappointed the whole movie and he was not at all needed for this movie. His worst performance ever.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|Don't worry, this review is completely spoiler-free!<br /><br />Chronicle basically is a story about three high school students who accidently gain the power of telekinesis.<br />Andrew, the main character, comes from a broken home and is bullied at school. To cope with his torment he decides to document his life, wich also creates a barrier between him and the world around him.<br />Matt is a laid-back philosopher who is not only Andrews cousin, but also his only friend.<br />Last but not least there is Steve. He is a populer student, who plans to work in politics.<br />At first Steve doesn't really have much to do with Andrew or Matt. Their friendship strengthens however, as they learn how to train their abilities and find out how much is possible, such as moving cars or even flying. It starts out as fun and games when Andrew suddenly causes a car crash, putting a man in the hospital. From this point on things tend to get out of hand, up to a disastrous point of no return.<br /><br />The entire movie is filmed in the found-footage-style. Even though this type of filming was oftenly used in the last couple of years, Chronicle manages to give it a new twist and keep it interesting.<br />Not only is the POV-Camera a main instrument to the plot it also is needed to underline Andrews character. The most innovative aspect is the mixture between the superpowers and the camera handling. As Andrew becomes more secure with his telekinesis he learns to control the camera, wich allows clean pan shots and gliding camera movements without disrupting the authenticity.<br /><br />Like most superhero movies, this is a movie for a middle-aged audience. It is an especially interesting movie for anybody who has ever wondered what it would be like to be able to fly or move objects with their minds. The movie shows this in such a fun to watch and authentic manner, you wouldn't doubt the logic of bending the rules of physics for a second.<br /><br />Naturally there are a couple of downsides to the movie. At the end of the movie, for example, it felt like the dedication to the POV-style coudln't keep up with the fast-paced action scenes. Also there is a subplot or two that seemed to be unnecessary, but all in all it is an entertaining movie I definetly recommend watching.
B006UG909U|5.0|\\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" should be taken as Van Halen's follow-up to \\"1984\\", and by that I mean I disregard everything in between. What a killer album, finally! Dave is back and so are Eddie and Alex. They inspire each other so much that the excitement can be truly felt when listening to these new songs. Eddie's son, Wolfgang, is great on bass and fits in like no one. I don't miss Michael Anthony, let Sammy have him.<br /><br />You get 13 songs of pure fun - Dave's lyrics are always entertaining and he sings `em like he means `em. It's like Van Halen need them to justify their unbelievable musicianship. Eddie, Alex and Wolf are obviously having the time of their lives playing together like this. It actually surprised the hell outta me, I wasn't exactly expecting this album to be THIS GREAT! It's bloody unbelievable to have this at this point in time. Rock on guys and keep them albums coming. I'll be on the lookout for the next one.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I was a bit skeptic about this CD, mainly because I was so disappointed in \\"A Thousand Suns.\\" I became a LP fan after hearing Papercut, and I've never looked back. Living Things, I believe, is the perfect album. Each song stands individually and makes its own statement. The words and music are haunting and melancholy, which I think is the perfect combination. I enjoyed this album, not just because of the amazing music and lyrics, but because it does not have any cursing. I think it shows how Linkin Park has matured and are not one of the \\"angst\\" bands which we must continually endure. I believe they have once again taken their own path, and it is up to everyone else to follow them. :d
0553801473|4.0|If you have made your way through Book 4 and you just aren't sure if you've got it in you to keep going, I recommend that you do.  You made it this far, right?  Not only that, but book five is really good.  The action in the series has certainly slowed down, but I don't think that is a bad thing.  One of the reasons I like the Song of Ice and Fire so much is because it is supposed to be a more realistic and complex read than other fantasy stories.  It seems natural to me that, after some big battles and the deaths and defeats of many major characters during the last books, things would slow down and start to build back up again.  It is also unfair to say that nothing happens in this one.  Book 4 was slow and often followed characters I wasn't as interested in, but Book 5 brings us back to the Wall (my favorite) and to our Dragon Queen.  We also get to see some sweet greenseer training with Bran, and there are hints that he will become an important player in whatever is going on in the north.<br /><br />I am confident that George Martin knows what he is doing and will get us there in the end.  For now, let's trust him to the driver's wheel and enjoy the ride.

B007PVHBHC|4.0|I had read so many glowing reviews of this CD that perhaps I had too high expectations.  I found on my first listening that I wasn't paying attention to most of it.  Second listening I started to warm a bit more.  The opening \\"Amerigo\\" is an intriguing mix with spoken lyrics and the chorus with strings that give a timeless feel, \\"Tracing the circles moving across my eyes, lying on a ship and gazing at the western skies, tracing lazy circles in the sky.\\"  The second track \\"April Fools\\" has a pulsing beat that draws you in with Smith's vocals seductive, \\"Come, you're the only one.\\"  On the rest of the CD, I enjoy the title track and \\"Nine.\\"  The rest are enjoyable and interesting to varying levels.  I loved Sloan Wainwright's cover of \\"After the Gold Rush\\" a couple years ago.  Whereas Sloan focused on Neil Young's gorgeous melody, Patti focuses more on the lyrics and gives the track a sense of gravity and profound meaning.  The child's chorus at the end is the perfect counterpoint of innocence.  This CD has plenty to offer fans.  I'm not sure that it will bring her a new generation of fans, but it's a strong outing from an artist who always follows her vision.  Enjoy!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am sometimes disappointed while reading a Book series, that after the first AMAZING book the rest of the series does not intrigue me as much.  I was a little hesitant and had this on the back of my mind while reading the Hunger Games Trilogy, thinking how they could end the series with a book that impressed me as much as the first.  \\"Mockingjay\\" not only met, but far exceeded my expectations to the end of the Hunger Games Trilogy. I highly recommend reading the whole series!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am extremely impressed with this first book of the 50 Shades Series and really look forward to starting \\"50 Shades Darker.\\" I highly recommend this book for someone who likes a spicy love novel now and again.  However, If you're someone that gets easily offended by reading say a Jackie Collins book, then this series is DEFINITIVELY NOT FOR YOU.  Lets just say I will be one of the first people in line at the ticket booth, should they decide to make this series into a movie....HINT HINT...if any casting directors are reading this I think Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway would be good for the two main characters. Think about it.....
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was searching for a new book on  my kindle and passed over this book a few times before trying it out. I read it in a day and loved it. I was truly impressed with the story and hung on every word. Half way through the book everything was good for the characters and I knew something would happen to derail their relationship. Slightly predictable at times, but there are a few curve balls. The ending was intense and moved quickly. I would have loved to read more about what happened when they returned home and the school learns of their new status. Sad it ended!

B001P36OY2|4.0|One can watch \\"Babylon A.D.\\" from different angles. First, as an action flick. It is good, and Vin Diesel did an excellent job. But it is not great, and does not exactly fit into the genre. The reason is simple. It was not intended to fit. It was widely reported that Fox intervened and cut 15 or even 70 minutes from the film for the theatrical release in order to get the coveted PG-13 rating. The director Mathieu Kassovitz said that he \\"never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way I wanted it to be. The script wasn't respected. Bad producers, bad partners, it was a terrible experience.\\" He chose to distance himself from the movie; in return, Fox did not properly promote it, if promoted it at all. Still, the second way to watch \\"Babylon A.D.\\" is to try to see in it something more than action sequences, and to try to see the intended message, which is quite transparent at some times. One can see that Mathieu Kassovitz, Vin Diesel, and M&eacute;lanie Thierry (the female lead, a wonderful French actress) aimed at something much more significant than an entertainment for 13-years old kids.<br /><br />It is not clear what is meant by an \\"uncut\\" version. It seems that no such version could exist. The 101 minutes version is classified by imdb.com, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, as \\"the extended cut\\". The theatrical version was 90 minutes. I believe that the cable TV version which I saw was the 101 minutes version. In any case, a good idea would be to ignore the final scenes (after Aurora is going through the flames or a little bit later). This nonsense wasn't intended to be there.<br /><br />If one likes both action flicks and art house films, then one can watch \\"Babylon A.D.\\" from both angles, and enjoy it much more. From my personal point of view, the film is worth watching for an extremely powerful sequence in Bering Strait alone.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|It's entertaining until the end. It doesn't do a good job of transitioning from entertainment to a commentary on human nature. It had incredible build up, but it didn't pop as well as one would expect.
B004ZIHYXO|3.0|What can I say, this \\"upbeat pop (euro) rap\\" (or whatever you call it) seems to be the trend of the 2010 and beyond.<br />At first one might think that this type of music seems to be a bit \\"girly\\", being played by teenies in their bedroom w/ posters of the respective artist on their walls, but at the end it is okay to like it; especially when youre mingling @ a social gathering (read: disco) with girls going crazy on the dance floor whilst this type of music is being played on the background. If you like this niche, make sure you check out black eyed peas, lmfao, rihanna, chris brown, usher, lady gaga, katy perry, nicki minaj, jessie j, don omar (idon and beyond), david guetta, flo rida, drake, afrojack ect etc.

B00005CDNJ|3.0|Not all that big of a deal but the cd I ordered had no label on it. The jewel box and insert were in order. The only information on the actual cd was a very small rectangular sticker with the name of the band/album and some superfluous (microscopically small) info. Something that you would expect to find on a bootleg. It plays fine however. I did get a response from the vendor which amounted to an off-handed apology but no offer to rectify the situation by replacing the cd. Not a transaction which inspired trust.

Maybe someone can advise me on how to do this properly other than by ripping it with Handbrake or some similar software,<br /><br />Okay, got that request out of the way so here is the Blu Ray review which only focuses on the quality of the Blu Ray transfer, both audio and video.  No acting critiques, plot summaries or evaluations of the practicality of this event occurring or CGI effects. (The male lion doesn't quite make it IMHO)  Not sure which I like better, the theatrical or alternate release, both put a different spin on things and both are fine.<br /><br />The Standard Def version was really quite good, the Blu Ray's audio tops it for clarity if not directionality and making full use of your complete sound system.  The original audio editing was top notch.  There is a definite improvement with the Blu Ray which contains both the theatrical and alternate releases of the film but since the regular DVD was as good as it was in the audio editing, the improvement does not make for a night and day comparison.  It is lossless audio and that is about the best you're going to get it.  The opening scenes really envelope you in the sight and sounds of the stricken city.<br /><br />The video transfer is equally excellent with sharp contrast and wonderful color saturation when appropriate.  The dark scenes looked a touch crushed in the blacks to me but detail was still there, no question about it.  I saw no grain even in the darkest of scenes.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksreview has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I usually enjoy games like this, but this one was just too confusing.  There wasn't a logical connection leading you to the next piece.  I finally gave up & had to go online to get a walkthrough.  I really expected more from this developer.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting, compelling and haunting.  I still have many unanswered questions myself, even though I know what happened in the end. How blind is our love that we cannot see what is so clearly defined?  The pain and denial that can tear apart the best of us.  I felt every emotion that Andy and Laurie did as the horrifying events of the story unfolded.  Extremely thought provoking.  I would love to know what my friends would think of this book.  I can see it as a major motion picture.
0606259090|2.0|This is a 1st person point of view story. Usually, this isn't to my liking. The only other books I enjoyed that were 1st person was the Twilight Series by S. Meyer. I read this book because of all the hype it's been getting. It's been called 'lady porn' and I would say that term fits.<br /><br />The Dominant Christian Grey is a very charming, wealthy man with a twisted past. He has everything a man could want. Anastasia Steele is a college student whom he wants for his submissive. She has self esteem issues and in my opinion she is too whiney and insecure to be a true likable character.<br /><br />I did find this an easy, entertaining read. Mr Grey definitely is 50 shades. I liked his character immediately. He drew me in. Ms. Steele must not only learn to bend to his will and obey his commands but find a way to free the man from his unsavory past and make him realize he is worthy of being loved. As her Dom he opens up a new world to her, lifestyle, and pleasures she never knew could exist. They introduce each other to many first.<br /><br />This book delivers hot sex, complex story line. But book 1 does not end in a HEA (Happily Ever After). Even though I enjoyed this story I'm not so sure I would invest my money and time in book 2 to find out if Ana and Christian reunite to work towards a HEA. I just don't see a man like Mr. Grey going for someone like Ana. It's not believable enough for me on that end as well as Ana's character flaws.<br /><br />I purchased this book from Amazon for my own reading pleasure.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I truly enjoy playing it and it helps to pass the time if you are waiting at the doctor!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Just like all of his other books, I adored this one! I found myself laughing out loud often. Sedaris is perfect for a little awkward humor after a heavy read. I love everything he has written.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|its a pretty fun game once you get the hang of it. so I guess you could get it if you want
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I agree and disagree with both sides out there. I just heard of the series last week and have been borrowing the books from a friend.<br /><br />For those hopeless romantics who are looking for a serious romance novel that they hope will happen to them- get real, take your nose out of a book, and get out and meet people because this book will send you into a depression worse the Avatar did. Reading some of the reviews most of these people sound like girls who are just mad that this will never happen to them. Hello, books are books- a chance to let our fantasies play out on paper and share them with the world. It's not a fortune for the person who reads it. Yes, Christian is a very intelligent young billionaire with security detail, expensive cars, multiple homes, amazing sexual prowess, drop dead sexy looks, and a black card. Please don't judge the book because that<br />\\"just can't happen\\". 99.999% of the things that can't happen do happen in books, that's why they're books!<br /><br />For those who are looking for entertainment in the fictional world because reality sucks, feel free to pick up this book! You can get lost in the characters. Yes, Ana is immature, getting jealous of pretty much any girl Christian had been in contact with, but she is very young and has never been in love before. She is insecure and new to this endeavor. I'm sure you weren't the way you are now with your husbands/long term boyfriends as you were with your first. And if your husband/longterm boyfriend is your first? Think back to how much you've grown. That's not something that comes with age, it comes with experience from age. So as young and inexperienced as she is, I found her character delightful to follow throughout the book. I felt her fear, anguish, curiosity, love, anger, pain, everything!<br /><br />I read a lot of fan fictions and amateur writing. There were many parts in this book that the writing is really amateur...repetitive words such as blushed, flushed, obtuse, the continuous reference to eyes, etc. The author was clearly not from America- I'm not one to get as picky as looking up the hotels and restaurants that she named. I'm okay with the thought that it's a book and if the author wants to make up a place go right ahead. The reason I say is because of her vocabulary, it definitely has a British accent to it. J.K. Rowling did a better job at catering to an American crowd. The plot was the biggest sign of writing immaturity. It went from nothing at all happening to something hgue and serious, and then was resolved far too quickly. And although I know that in life things just suddenly happen, I would like to believe that in a book a little more time passes by then just a couple of pages. It simply seemed like the author got bored and wanted a certain amount of things to happen so she threw in some stuff in between, plugged in some sex, and made herself a story. Then she added some fluff in where she felt as though wasn't too important. But those were times that we could have gotten to know Ana a bit better and she didn't take advantage. A good book that is well written I feel we should know the main characters like they are our close friends- especially when its written in first person POV.<br /><br />AS A BOOK itself when your not picking at the writer, she had a great idea and had good thought. Maybe with a better editor the book would have been stunning. I've been known to over write and put in too much detail, but I know my story is told thorough and true. The initial plot is great, a young couple falling in love for the first time for each of them. You go through the emotional turmoil with Ana, first intrigued by Christian then loving him to hating him...it's a fun emotional roller coster to be on. The sex scene's (although quite frequent) are great. For those who think Ana too easy lets remember every woman is different and a lot about sex is in the brain. Don't be jealous because your firsts were just as new as you were andprobably really bad. Maybe it isn't for older audiences who are looking for realistic things, but for a younger crowd (18-28) more so. It is still a romance novel, and usually I don't have much patience for them, but I loved this one and not just for the sex but for the characters. I really fell in love with Christian and Ana.<br /><br />All in all, I think the book is great for those who are just looking for entertainment. I am a rather well rounded critic and I feel in love with the characters and plot, but at some points grimaced at the writing and vocabulary. Either way, I finished each book in 2 days max!
B003INBOEM|5.0|As a student of Wing Chun, in the Tradition of Ip Man and his Son Ip Ching it was amazing to see what certain things like Chi Sao and Pak Sao come together from the Sil Lum Tao. Also knowing that this is the man that was a mentor to Bruce Lee. You can see and hear a lot of the things that must have influenced the young Bruce Lee. For purely Action fans, it will certainly rate as one of the best Action/Martial Arts movies of all time.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Great read. The Ideas discussed in this book are worth discussing in your company, whether big or small, that challenge the status quo.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I am an author of several books, and I feel as if only I understand why Collins killed some major characters. She was being unique. It takes amazing commitment to kill a character you love. Rarely do authors have that power. Allow Collins to prove herself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game!!! Some games remind of some older games!!! very entertaining and a lot of games for free!!! great to play when ur bored
B008220AVW|2.0|Look, I know if you are a \\"fan\\" of Katy Perry and the image she projects, you'll think this \\"movie\\" is Citizen Kane. Me, being a Seventies and Eighties kind of guy, I actually like several of her songs, and she doesn't look too bad on stage. However, she isn't John Lennon, Bob Dylan or even Madonna; she just isn't that interesting outside the music. All I want is a full-blown concert video without all the \\"part of me\\" stuff. This is the third DVD she has released that is mostly about her life, her fans and what people say about her. She's had one decent album and a half-dozen hits to her credit, and that warrants all of this??? I don't want to know Perry the narcissist, I just want to see a dern concert film.
0553382152|5.0|I had a NDE at age 7 and this book is just truly fantastic, it has really helped me to develop my spirituality.  Betty's 2nd and 3rd books are also awesome.  A great read if you want to see what Heaven is like.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game it is the best some people maybe not like it because people have there own opinion but this is my opinion: I love it!!! :)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|There are two kinds of writers in this world. Those who write for the love of writing and those who write for fame and money. The latter is not necessarily less skilled at their craft than the former but when you read a book as good as Blood Song you can not fail to realize that the author drew inspiration from a source deep inside himself with no thought of worldly riches or fame holding him back in the process of creating a masterpiece. In other words the author is telling a tale that he feels needs telling and not just writing a book that will conform to whatever is the most popular selling point of the day.<br /><br />In Blood Song religious bigotry is at the order of the day and tells the story of a young boy forced into service to the sixth order of the Faith which is the fighting arm of the state religion. Plot upon plot is revealed as the story unfolds and our hero discovers that all is not as it is proclaimed by the leaders of the Faith and the king. Magic is shunned in the realm and any who is suspected of being involved with the Dark as magic is referred to is imprisoned and killed. Anyone who denounces the Faith is openly hunted and persecuted and great artrocities are committed in the name of religion. It is against this backdrop that our hero rises in rank and has to come to terms with his faith, his king and his ever increasing doubt in the justice of what is being done to innocent people.<br /><br />This is fantasy literature at its best. Fast paced, large vivid action scenes and masterful story telling with characters so well created they seem almost real. You will not be able to put this book down until the last page and then you'll be quite annoyed that you have to wait for the next book in the series. It's really that good.
161657481X|1.0|I tried to read the book, but could not get into it.  Checked the book on CD out of the library and basically forced myself to listen to it because I didn't have another book on CD on hand.  This book is just boring.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|There is only one word that truly describes this book, magical. 'The Night Circus' is filled, from beginning to end, with the richest descriptions I have ever had the pleasure of reading. This is precisely what I consider to be the book's strongest point, the fact that Erin manages to transport her readers into this world. Her talent for weaving words into breath-taking descriptions is amazing.<br /><br />While some have indicated that it has far too many characters, I believe this serves to add diversity to the story. As well as complexity. You have whimsical and tragic characters weaving their stories in this universe. It is nearly impossible to not find something one can relate to in each character.<br /><br />When asked about this book I can't help but to gush about it. It made me fall in love with reading all over again!
B0039HR5QS|5.0|Early 70s, end of Bretton Woods gold standard, US needs, oil for its war in Vietnam and other places and the Saudis agree to only accept US dollars for oil. That's some of the reality behind this story. THe US has to control the Middle East and we have been there ever since, killing and being killed. This movie deserves a good look by anyone interested in what really makes the US tick.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it makes it more fun because you can get power upps.I recommend this game 2 everyone.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|The boring stuff: Arrived on time, new condition,fabulous sound quality.<br />The good stuff: Every note.<br />A friend in Italy turned my husband onto PFC. We watched a few You Tube videos, then immediately ordered both CD/DVDs. This is like a whirlwind trip around the world and finding love at every stop. It gives you hope.  As for the musicians, Grandpa Elliott has the sweetest voice, Clarence Bekker will have you grinning and rocking, and Roberto Luti will hold you spellbound with his rusty old National steel guitar. We are now feverishly trying to find out where Roberto will be in September when my husband will be in Italy. Hearing him live is now on his bucket list.<br />Listen, watch, cry, laugh. Amazing.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|its got a great interface and it fies what it sets out to do great job well worth it more. words
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|What a deal for both a DVD and CD, not to mention the joy, hope, and love! We watched all the videos on You Tube, then rushed to buy both PFC 1 and 2. Waiting for delivery, I wondered if we really needed to buy when we could see them anytime on You Tube. The answer is YES! Sound quality is fantasic. You watch these and think, \\"It's all so simple. Why doesn't everyone get it?\\" However, being way too pragmatic, I realized the haters will hate no matter what. Thank goodness creator Mark Johnson is an optimist. Thanks to these loving people there are now schools where children are taught English, dancing, and music where no one ever thought to give them this international language of love. Order at least one of everything, then go to [...] and buy more stuff, donate, join, watch, listen.

0307913090|5.0|Summary:<br />Told from the point of view of different characters. This time we followed members of the Stark family, Eddard the lord of Winterfell, his wife Catelyn, and their children Bran, Arya, Sansa, and Eddard's bastard son Jon; Danerys Targaryen forced to leave the King's Landing and the throne that is rightfully a Targaryen's before she was even born; lastly we follow Tyrion Lannister, an imp from the family of the wife of the king. When the story starts there have been seven years of summer, and they are coming to an end. At the Wall, which protects the kingdom from the cold waste land they are beginning to see the effects the end of summer has. At King's Landing the hand of the king has died and King Robert Baratheon comes to Winterfell to ask his old friend Eddard to be his new hand. What follows is full of adventure, plotting, treachery, and deceit.<br /><br />Feelings:<br />I could not bring myself to read this book but have really enjoyed listening to it. I had a hard time getting used to having a male read the voices of young women. Once I got through the first 3-4 chapters I started enjoying listening to Roy Dotrice reading. Something I really didn't appreciated was the night walkers or white walkers, for heavens sake they are just glorified zombies so why not call them such. I have a personal aversion to zombies and try to avoid them, however, I did like this. I'm not sure if I will like the books when winter is in full force and night walkers roam free. I will note that the book felt really masculine to me and I think that is part of the reason I had trouble actually reading the book. Listening to the book some of the masculine language seem toned down a bit. I really did enjoy this and I would recommend it to others looking for something to listen to on a long drive. I would recommend if you are female and have tried to read the book but couldn't to go strait for the audio book a much better choice. I will definitely be listening to the next book.
B007MG360G|5.0|I loved this game but the day I got it was the same day I finished it. they need to come up. with a update realy soon .
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Great game. Playing it on my kindle fire. Amazing. Reminds me of playing Mario when I was younger! Just great!
0425263908|4.0|Only reason I didnt give it five stars is because after reading Fifty Shades, Sylvia Day's character Eva lacked personality. She basically sweeps issues to the side as if they never occured. Very rare a woman will not touch subjects that obviously bother her. After reading this book, along with many other friends, we all agreed it was a good read but didn't surpass our expectations.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|was fun at first but after a while it got boring. it is ssssoooo boring now. do not play this game it is boring.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. Totally addictive! Ads pop up between games- but it's a free app so that's to be expected.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This girl's memoir of her hiking the Pacific Crest Trail was at once, funny and sometimes hysterical, sometimes sad but always heartwarming.  Her recollection of her upbringing, her father, her siblings, and especially her mother are compelling.  I couldn't put it down.

0345803485|5.0|I loved the trilogy. Once I started I could not put it down, at all!!! I read all 3 books within 2 weeks. Really loved how she made you a part of their lives and what a great story line. Can't wait for more from EL James. Definitely a summer read!
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|Its a very useful product for carrying your plantronic, when not in use. As opposed to having it in your pocket or just handing on your ear. I purchased it from Amazon.
B00846REIS|5.0|I had just finished the Fifty Shades trilogy and needed another book similar. I found it!!! Wow, this book is great. Excellent read. Waiting patiently for book 2 to come out in October to find out what is next for Gideon and Eva. Mentioned the books to my coworkers and friends and they are hooked also.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Movie<br /><br />Black-ops agent Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is double crossed and left for dead by her own agency in this Steven Soderbergh directed action thriller.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Haywire was filmed with Red One cameras which results in an awesome picture that has remarkable clarity but I did notice that the picture got softer  in extremely bright scenes.  I am sure it stems from the fact  that the backdrops did not have any artificial light and relied solely on natural light. While the picture was soft in well-lit scenes it maintained a great deal of detail. Darker scenes seemed to be where the filmed shined best because a lot of small details became extremely clear.<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />Haywire was mastered with a DTS-HD 5.1 track  which made gunfire very immersive. In certain quiet scenes I did have to crank up the volume because the dialogue was extremely muffled. Most times the muffled dialogue came from Antonio Banderas so be aware of that if you are watching this film at low volume. The HD track did a great job with a lot of the close contact fight scenes since every impact resonated through the front and center speakers in my home theater. Punches and kicks did not come off as canned sounds like in a lot of films but had a genuine feel. Sound engineers did great work in that regard. One thing I noticed Soderbergh did often was use music in non dialogue scenes frequently which some may find annoying. I actually found the music complimented the fight scenes well.<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />Extras in this film were rather limited. I am not a big viewer of extras but one focused on Gina Carano's fight training and the other on the male leads (Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton and Ewan McGregor) that shared screen time with Gina Carano.<br /><br />My Take<br /><br />Haywire at first glance has the makings of an action classic but I felt let down after the credits rolled. Gina Carano minus heraltered voice did a great job in her acting debut and had awesome chemistry with all the male leads. She had natural screen presence which is something very  fighters and pro wrestlers lack when they transition to acting. Fight choreography was the high point of this film due to the very close proximity of the camera during fights.  Carano did a great job making the fights look believable and showcased her MMA and Muay Thai background well.  The plot of the film though was very paint by numbers like most action thrillers which is something I did not expect from Steven Soderburgh after seeing his other work. The film ended abruptly and really failed to close out certain plot points which again considering the director was a big blemish.<br /><br />Recommendation<br /><br />Haywire is a solid action film that does not demand repeat viewing sadly. If you are a fan of Steven Soderburgh then you may want to check this out but I can't in good faith recommend this as a purchase if anything it's rental worthy at best.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|excellent scifi series. all the elements necessary for a compelling smart \\"end of civilization\\" type saga. look forward to more
B000NTPDSW|4.0|There's not much to say about these movies that hasn't been said already. In a few words, they're masterpieces, pure and simple.<br /><br />So I'll make this review short and to the point.<br /><br />This set has the terrifying \\"Discs made in Mexico\\" sticker that is synonym of cheap labor and low quality control. You better check your discs for fingerprints and even scratches on the data side.<br /><br />I knew that there was something up when I bought this boxset for only $22.49, it just didn't occured to me at the time that this was the reason for the dirty-cheap price.<br /><br />Even then, I've decided to knock only one star down from this review, because, like I already said, these movies are masterpieces and I was really happy to finally have them on my slowly growing Blu-Ray collection.<br /><br />So for all of you guys that are always concerned about the country of origin of your products, this is a Mexican boxset.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|This doll is cute and snuggly. The body is soft, and the baby's bottom is some sort of a buckwheat (little balls like the kind in the airplane pillows that wrap around your neck), to give it a bit more heft and actually allow her to \\"sit up\\" ...granted in a bit of a slouchy manner if she's not pushed into a tea party table. The outfit on the Mon Premier Calin in pink comes off, with a velcro attachment at the back, to reveal a sewn on one-piece undergarment. I liked this because we, of course, had to take it off and then she wasn't hanging around the house \\"naked.\\" It was said that the baby doll was cold so the outfit went back on (though who knows where the cute hat went). The reviewer grossed out by the two tiny tiny teeth painted on that you only notice when you tip her upside down, needs to lighten up. Lots of babies have little budding teeth, and that's all I'd call them, not fangs or anything. The top lip hides them and we only saw them because we were seeing if a different brand baby bottle fit in her mouth (it didn't). My child was very excited to notice teeth and pointed to her own. I don't sense any big vanilla smell(I was thinking it was gonna be like those plug ins smelling up the room). Just kind of smells like a new baby doll. The eyelashes blink when you move the dolls' head, but I wouldn't say it's always consistent, like not always when you put her down. The doll's head can also be spun all the way around if you turn it, but it doesn't do this on it's own, it took some effort.<br /><br />Because it is such a small and snuggly doll, I think this one would be a really good one to prepare an older sibling for the arrival of a new baby in the house. They sell dolls with hospital bracelets (which never made sense to me because they come off as soon as the real baby gets home), but I could see child #1 and the Corolle doll snuggled up with mommy and baby #2. I'd recommend it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I do not usually review products on Amazon, but just wanted to chime in on these headphones. I owe it to them. These are the real deal and by far the best investment in electronics equipment I have made.<br /><br />No, this will not say \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\", because I bought them in 1999 at a local guitar shop after listening to countless headphones and reading reviews online. Yes, those Grados were nice, but I ended up with these.<br /><br />After 13 years of comfortable, problem-free, acoustically superior, aesthetically pleasing service, this pair is, well, still providing this service. To my amazement, I actually have never had a single mechanical or electrical problem with them. They have lived in two countries, taken a few transpacific plane rides with me, been stepped on, lost, found, hoisted, dropped, and probably endured a number of other forms of trauma I have blocked from my memory.<br /><br />The only reason I am on Amazon right now is because I am looking for replacement ear pads because these have gotten ratty (still perfectly comfortable and effective, just ratty :P).<br /><br />I like my stuff to last. Have you ever grown old with a piece of beloved *electronics* equipment? Okay yes my Paradigm monitors and I go way back too, but probably your answer is no. It's hard to believe, but these headphones been by my side for 13 years--a pretty sizable chunk of my life. I hope you can develop as much adoration as I have for this enduring product.<br /><br />Okay enough singing of praises. I don't really like pros and cons lists, so here are some things to think about (in addition to all these other comments) when deciding whether to make this purchase (good and bad).<br /><br />- They do not work as well as silicon ear canal buds for blocking out airplane engine noise.<br />- These were designed for the studio (in fact, I've noticed them used in practically every recorded studio performance I've seen), so despite the folding mechanism, they are bulky.Between the cord and large earpieces, they are not great for physical activity. The cord is heavy and can get in the way. Obviously, don't try to go jogging with them. They are not ideal for biking, but I have worn them on the bike path successfully.<br />- They are hard to take off your head with one hand. Weird complaint, but I often listen before bed and then try and pull them off with one hand. It's not easy and they will fold up sometimes when I do this.<br />- The lengthening/shortening mechanism on both sides is a little slippery and they tend to shorten. I solved this years ago by putting a little piece of adhesive rubber on the metal part to keep it from slipping in too far. (However, over time, the top band actually appears to have conformed to my head, as I do not need the rubber stoppers anymore.)<br />- I would often forget I have these on and sit at my computer for hours in comfortable silence, preoccupied with something else, well after whatever I was listening to ended. Yes, they are that comfortable. However, hours of this can lead to sexy ear sweat.<br />- The awesome blue \\"Professional\\" sticker started peeling after 9 years. I wish Sony would paint or engrave this on.<br /><br />Disclaimer: All of the above is based on the same model purchased 13 years ago, so maybe things have changed. For one, I know that mine were made in Japan. I don't know if this is still the case, as I have heard Sony is starting to outsource even electronics production in order to stay competitive.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The Esv Study Bile reads well and the translation is accurate.  The verses with study notes are flaged and positioning the cursor and depressing the five way switch on the Kendell takes you to the notes section.  The back switch takes you back to the Bible passages you were reading. Easy to use and great for studying or teaching Sunday School.

Read books 1-3 and reading Clash of Kings now.

Extremely exciting read if you like fantasy.

158049594X|4.0|Should I review a classic? Really, what's the point? This book is historic and mandatory reading for many high schools and a true insight into the European era it was written (1818). Language, thoughts, opinions, attitudes, social classes, locations - it's all there. It's like a time machine and that aspect of the book is fasinating. Then there's the classic elements...<br />  This is true gothic horror. It's not blood and guts and \\"shoot'em up\\" that is all too necessary to hold an audiences' attention in today's world. \\"Frankenstein\\" is psychological terror in the same vein as \\"what's hiding around the corner.\\" We follow Victor's inner thoughts and paranoia as he sinks deeper and deeper into depression, fear and finally resolve that he must kill the monster he created or die trying.<br />  As someone who was an avid reader in high school - but not the mandatory assignments, (my personal classics are more modern works) - it is quite a few years after my graduation. I picked up \\"Frankenstein\\" because it is my son's mandatory summer reader. Once I started, I couldn't put it down.<br />  But again - reviewing a classic? Okay - some may find this a lame excuse, but I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because of my upbringing in the modern \\"shoot'em up\\" world. The meanings were all there for me - man vs God, man vs woman, etc... But there were too many coincidences within the story that made me shake my head in disbelief. Europe is a continent and not someone's neighborhood where even then it would be difficult to find someone hiding from you. But if you can shut down your reasoning and throw disbelief to the howling wind, \\"Frankenstein\\" has the fear factor to keep you awake and wondering at night who or what could be lurking around your neighborhood.<br />  One final note: For any high schooler thinking about skipping this mandatory reading assignment and watching the movie instead, just plan on testing for a GED after you wise up. The Boris Karloff version sticks to the book about as closely as the Abbott and Costello film. In fact, check out Gene Wilder in \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and write your report on that one. At least your teacher will have a few laughs grading your paper!ook about as closely as the Abbott and Costello film.

B005LAIHYU|5.0|Sadly, we've taught our children to be far too literal.  I honestly wonder if any of the people knocking this film know what drama is about.  We seem to have forgotten the meaning behind our metaphorical systems.  ALVH is, quite simply, one of the best films I've seen in ten years.  It's brilliant on many levels -- it's great cinema, wonderful theater, and a fine mythic contribution to film.  Obviously, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter is using Abe as a metaphor.  The film (and book) is not about vampires at all, but it is about very real and far more dangerous human phenomena that are still with us.  It uses vampirism as a symbol.<br /><br />The performers are excellent.  Benjamin Walker in the title role is perfect.  His portrayal is subtle where it needs to be and larger-than-life where that is needed.  The film is filled with mythical violence that isn't nearly as bloody as it might have been.  The direction is pitch-perfect.  20% either way and this film would have been howlingly hilarious.  It isn't at all, which is a great compliment to the genius of the director.<br /><br />Anyone who passes this movie off to a surface assessment is missing the entire point of the film.  I'm buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD, and I buy very, very few DVD.

0143119680|2.0|Oh, how I wanted to like this book.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I first saw it. Scholarly female witch meets foreboding, intelligent male vampire with a domineering streak. Takes place in Oxford, France, and New England. Together the pair search to unravel the mysteries of an ancient enchanted alchemical text while keeping it from other supernatural beings that may use it unwisely. And the novel is nearly 600 pages to boot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it could have been whittled down to 200. A Discovery of Witches is full of extraneous details that simply do not matter to the characterization or plot. It could never be considered a pageturner in any sense of the word because so much of it is repetitive, discussing Diana's clothing choices and everyday trips to the library. Diana and Matthew spend an enormous amount of time hiding out at Matthew's mother's house in France, and still more time hiding out at Diana's aunts' house in New England. Even the climactic point of the novel - if you can call it that - is quickly resolved.<br /><br />I was amazed at how much of a Mary Sue the Diana Bishop character actually is, especially in an adult novel. Diana has far more different kinds of magical powers than any fellow witches but refuses to use them and runs away from her destiny. She smells like honeysuckle, which is mentioned enough that I still recall it. She spunkily resists Matthew's charms for a few scenes, then predictably succumbs. She is thoroughly disliked for being a witch by Matthew's tough-as-nails mother, until Diana wins her over and gains her unwavering loyalty. It all felt very contrived, and Diana Bishop never seemed like a genuinely real, fully formed character to me.<br /><br />I expected to like Matthew Clairmont's character, but instead he fell flat. He had appealing qualities, but these weren't demonstrated very naturally within the novel. While it may be realistic for Matthew and Diana to get along well, it seemed like their relationship remained stagnant in many ways, despite the fact that they considered themselves \\"as good as married\\" by the end. It could have been worse - Harkness was careful to have Matthew react benevolently when he found out that Diana had been snooping in his desk drawers and discovered a secret of his, rather than start a fight that would have been blown out of proportion for the sake of drama.<br /><br />Harkness's strong points revolved around the discussion of alchemy, history, and surprisingly, the DNA of supernatural creatures, though there were hardly enough in-depth conversations about these topics to make the novel worthwhile reading. This is a difficult review to write because I get the impression that Harkness worked very hard and put a lot of research into this book, whereas some critiques are easy to make because it's obvious the author didn't spend enough time on her project. That's not the case with Harkness. She has credentials and it makes sense that she writes a wine blog because the sensory imagery of smell and taste turn up in A Discovery of Witches again and again, not just in the context of wine.<br /><br />The relationship between Aunt Sarah and Em is refreshing and fits into the female-oriented culture of witches very well. The antics of the aunts' old house is one of the most humorous and enjoyable parts of the book. The house can produce objects and entirely new rooms when the need calls for it, and ghosts of Diana's ancestors regularly wander and interject animated opinions into the conversations of the living. But nonetheless, there were fundamental pacing, plot, and characterization problems with this novel that many readers will find impossible to ignore.<br /><br />It struck me as an adult novel, referencing wine, alchemy, history, science, and many other 'cultured' topics, with characters that ultimately behaved as if they'd sprung out of the pages of a Young Adult novel and happened to find their way into this one. Both main characters were idealizedto the point that it became a turn-off, and they made overly romantic and irrational decisions that seemed more akin to teenaged choices.<br /><br />I did not even consider the ending to be a \\"cliffhanger\\" by any means, unlike some reviewers. It did not make me curious about Harkness's second book in the trilogy, because there was no sign that she intended to pick up the pace. Worst of all, judging by the title, I expected the book to be a lot more about witches than it actually was. It was more about vampires than witches, and more about the love between Matthew and Diana than anything else. Because I wasn't invested in their relationship, this left me unsatisfied.to the point that it became a turn-off, and they made overly romantic and irrational decisions that seemed more akin to teenaged choices.<br /><br />I did not even consider the ending to be a \\"cliffhanger\\" by any means, unlike some reviewers.

0143118706|4.0|For a book that presents only one main weak argument for marriage that the author herself doesn't completely buy, this is actually a pretty entertaining and informative read.<br /><br />The weak argument in question involves the acknowledgment that marriage has always been fought for in societies across the globe and all different historical time periods, even when those in power were strongly against different varieties of marriage or marriage in general. Marriage, in other words, was demanded by couples before it was demanded or expected by institutions, and generally, it's been the institutions that caved to the will of the people, not the other way around. As a self-described bohemian, Elizabeth Gilbert found this take on marriage appealing.<br /><br />Fans of Eat, Pray, Love will spot familiar travel narratives as Gilbert and her Brazilian boyfriend, Felipe, journey to Southeast Asia after the United States \\"deported\\" Felipe (not officially, but Gilbert has no better term to describe it, and they do end up in an unexpected meeting with the Dept. of Homeland Security). Learning about the U.S. immigration process via the couple's personal experience with it is an added bonus.<br /><br />Gilbert examines marriage from the perspective of the Southeast Asian people she meets, as well as reflecting on the marriages of her mother and grandmother. A particularly fascinating chapter focuses on the history of marriage, and the idea that what we consider \\"traditional\\" marriage is a far more recent concept. Gilbert includes tidbits like a tradition in China for single women to marry dead men, and medieval Germany's practice of offering two different kinds of marriages to choose from: Muntehe, which was a permanent life contract, and Friedelehe, a looser living arrangement that involved no merging of money or inheritance and could be broken by either party if he or she wished. The evolving view of the Church on matrimony is highlighted in a historical narrative that is very relevant to present-day.<br /><br />Gilbert weaves stats from scientific studies with views on relationships from great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Carl Jung. She aptly communicates factors that make it more likely for a marriage to last, but emphasizes that nothing is guaranteed. Gilbert's personal journey with Felipe is chronicled throughout each chapter, and she makes a compelling argument for why she is so averse to marriage in the first place, which may be an eye-opener to those who have only considered the pros or perceived marriage as an inevitability.<br /><br />Gilbert is bravely honest about both herself and her partner, and provides humbling (and funny) anecdotes intermixed with more general research about marriage. This was a quick read and kept me turning pages, although lack of in-depth sources did have me questioning a few of her points.<br /><br />People who won't like this book: Those who find memoirs self-absorbed or boring. This is a personal memoir, not an objective treatise on marriage, and Gilbert does bring her lively opinions along, but she is very upfront about this from the beginning.relevant to present-day.<br /><br />Gilbert weaves stats from scientific studies with views on relationships from great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Carl Jung.

B005LAII08|5.0|What a wonderful family film!  I guess it's a \\"kid's\\" film but I absolutely LOVED it!  It has such wonderful lessons and it was done so well.  The film is happy and sad, funny, and has emotional momemts, even a touch of magic is in the air.  It is colorful and has music, even to the bagpipes of Scotland.  This is a Disney Pixar film, so you have the wonderful animations that feel almost human.<br /><br />The movie begins with the king and queen playing with their little red-haired daughter on her birthday.  Even at the ripe old age of maybe 5, little Merida is headstrong, bright, and bubbly.  And she sees the wisps, a kind of blue fairy type light that sends her in certain directions.<br /><br />We watch Princess Merida grow, and be instructed in the ways of a Princess by her \\"Mum,\\" the Queen.  Now that she is of age, Mum decides it is time to have a suitor party so the gents can compete for her hand.  But Merida has a mind of her own.  Just to add a little extra excitement, Merida has three young brothers (triplets!)<br /><br />Again, this is a fun flick with lots of funny moments, some even laugh-out-louds.  And the bagpipes are always special to me (some of my heritage).  Some valuable lessons for the children about perception, seeing things in a certain way, responsibilities, listening to others, considering alternatives, forgiveness and love.  Many of you with children will likely buy this movie when it becomes available.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I am a male age 71. I down loaded this book by accident whilst looking at the sample.<br /> Having paid for it I decided to try to read it. Thus far I am about 15% through it. Clearly it is as most reviews have indicated targeted at a early middle age female market.It is what is now commonly known as 'Mummy Porn'. At my age and being a man of the world I was not surprised by any of the content. I could reccomend it to any younger man who would like to gain an insight into the female mind and increase his sexual strike rate. Such a man would need to be able to locate a female clitoris and have a good knowledge of gentle knots, bends and hitches.An interest in pulleys and other warehouse apparatus would be usefull. He would also need to be tall handsome and rich and have a versatile penis. In summary harmless fun but not for me. I will keep it on my Kindle in case I meet any one who wants to know what all the fuss is about.
B00004STDN|4.0|Most movie goers/watchers may decide to give this film a try because Stallone leads the cast. What a surprise. Stallone brought NOTHING to this film but his name. The salvation of the film is in it's special effects, action scenes, AND it's supporting cast. They do the job...bring home the bacon, while Sly provides. only the ham. HOWEVER, this is a very good movie! The plot is not the same old same old, but brings a fresh white canvas, aptly painted with colorful scenes you actually do not anticipate. I bought the movie, after having seen it before. That says I may think stallone is flop, but the movie is worth seeing all over again. You WILL be very glad you purchased the movie. BTW has any body told John Lithgow yet he flew way over the top of the net with his english(I think) accent?

B004K7HMJ6|3.0|Jessie J makes great music videos. She has a constantly appealing camera presence and exudes genuine enthusiasm not just for her music, but for life in general. However, once you start listening to the album without that visual dimension, it starts to sound derivative. Her lack of vocal dynamics becomes grating. And the lyrics get simplistic and bland.<br /><br />My observations don't seem to matter much, in the bigger picture. According to Wikipedia, she's \\"the first British female artist to have six top ten singles on one album.\\" And, \\"Jessie has sold over 11 million singles and 2.5 million albums worldwide.\\" So she's obviously clicking with a lot of people. I'm guessing that the target audience is just too young to hear all the other artists echoing throughout the studio every time a track starts up. Beyonce, Pink, Katy Perry, Rhianna... Artists who are -- not to put too fine a point on it -- more artistically interesting and identifiable.<br /><br />The album comes off as one long and unsuccessful struggle to establish an identity distinct from her influences. She complicates things further by trying on a variety of stylistic hats. So there's no consistent tone, either. There's no \\"Jessie J Sound.\\" She doesn't seem to be aware of this and plows happily forward. This is not unusual for a young artist, but it is unusual to be this pronounced -- yet this successful.<br /><br />With a more controlled vocal delivery, and a lot more creative inspiration, I think she could put together something great. But I'm not optimistic. I think I'll always look forward to her videos, though.

B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is the first time Spielberg embraced the R rating, after grappling for years with the MPAA, despite many violent scenes in his films, for the more \\"family-friendly\\" PG or, after the edgy violence in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, PG-13, to cram as many butts in theater seats and thus make as much money as possible.  Schindler's List, oddly enough, was supposed to be an obscure little art film about an unpleasant subject that wasn't supposed to make much money, and ended up being a worldwide phenomenon.  His subsequent movies, whatever their MPAA rating, have been braver, and better for it ever since.<br /><br />While we've certainly seen moments of brutality depicted in Spielberg's earlier films, here is the first time he shows shameless murder, at point-blank range.  The murders depicted in this film, Luger shots to the head, sniper rifle shots from rooftop, women almost gassed, etc., etc., are far more horrifying than any shark attack in Jaws, any fistfight in Indiana Jones, any beating in The Color Purple or Empire of the Sun.<br /><br />While the film is undoubtedly Spielberg's darkest work to date, darker than Minority Report, and even darker than the even more extremely violent Saving Private Ryan, I still remember there being a few more shots in Schindler's initial theatrical release, a release that was apparently recalled by Spielberg, to trim or replace some of these more graphic shots of sadistic violence:<br /><br />1)  During the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, when the boy that ran off to escape death, is being dragged back by two German soldiers and is shot, a Jewish man screams \\"You bastard!\\", and one of the German soldiers levels his Luger at the man's head and fires.  The man's skull, under the cap he's wearing, fractures, and blood spurts out.  This shot is completely cut from this version.<br /><br />2)  When Goethe hits Helen the first time in the basement at night, in the initial version, she just stands there, stoicly, but quivering with tears, as blood streams from her nose, and he hits her again.  In this version, blood still streams from her nose, but she has her hand over her face.<br /><br />4)  While it's not a violent scene, when Schindler is thrown in prison for \\"violating the Race and Resettlement Act\\" (kissing a Jewish girl), his prison mate tells Schindler why he was in prison, then asks \\"And what about you?\\"  In this version, the scene picks right up with \\"And what about you?\\"<br /><br />4)  At the end of the film, when we see Goethe saying \\"Heil Hitler\\" and finally hanged for his crimes against humanity, in the initial version, his body continues to dangle side-to-side as we see the title explaining his fate.  In this version, the image simply freezes as we see the title.<br /><br />While some of these shots are no doubt sick and sadistic, for puristic reasons, it would be nice to see them re-inserted again, to see Spielberg's full vision.  Perhaps, on blu-ray, Spielberg will release R and Unrated Versions (!).  Apparently, the director felt, and rightly so, that he went too far in these shots.  The excisement of these shots hardly \\"softens\\" the film.  It still packs a whallop, an affront, to one's own morality, sensibility and sanity.  The casual, even cavalier behavior of the Germans, particularly in the night of the Krakow ghetto massacre, when Jews hiding, in a piano, under a bed, in closets, etc., are machine gunned while a young German soldier plays the piano, presumably to block out the horrible noise, and two other German soldiers appear in the doorway and ask him, in German supremacy mindset, \\"Est Bach?\\"  \\"Nein, Mozart\\", is an abomination that will make you sick.<br /><br />Being, myself, of German descent, I'm ashamed of my own race when I watch this film.  How could a people so classy, so educated, so family-oriented, so full of love, as the Germans, commit such atrocities?  While I'm not condoning their behavior by any means, one has to look at history and remember that the state of the German economy was in absolute shambles after WWI, and Hitler pulled Germany out of its economic depression (largely by confuscating all the money and possessions from the Jews), so the German people revered him as a kind of demigod.  In their eyes, he could do no wrong.  Hitler said \\"the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it\\", and he concocted the biggest lie in human history, that all the problems of the world were attributed to the Jews.  The Germans were willing to sweep any and all atrocities under the rug in order to keep their own lives intact.  Many of the death camps were located right in the middle of German neighborhoods.  The fact is, any German who opposed the Fuerher would simply be shot or sent to concentration camp along with the rest of the innocents, so the German people could do nothing to prevent this Holocaust, except let Jewish people hide in their attics or under their floorboards, which many German people did, to their own danger.<br /><br />Who can fault a people, the Jews, for being brilliant, and for having a talent for numbers, for business?  As Geothe's character says, prior to the Ghetto massacre, \\"They came here with nothing.  Nothing.  And they flourished.\\"  And what is wrong with that?  We can LEARN from each other, and DO BUSINESS WITH each other, not slaughter each other!  Such is the nature of hate and intolerance.<br /><br />Itsaak Stern's accountant is thoroughly obsessed with keeping Schindler's company running, not in the interest of making a profit, but in the interest of saving lives.  Schindler, initially only interested in profiteering off free Jewish slave labor \\"Poles cost more.  Why should I pay Poles?\\", after witnessing the horror of the ghetto massacre, and then being visited by a young Jewish woman who passes herself off as a rich financier to tell him his factory is perceived as a \\"haven\\" and begs him to spare her parents (to which Schindler angrily reacts \\"Subjectivities are illegal!\\", but then has a heart-to-heart conversation with Stern about the murdering behavior of Geothe), Schindler finally relents and gives up his pricey wristwatch so the woman's parents can be taken to his factory, to safety.  At that moment, Schindler realizes that he has the power to save lives.  This scene moves me to tears.<br /><br />While there were certainly many more opportunities for murder, including showing people actually being gassed in the gas chambers (going into seizures, vomiting, etc.) and babies being tossed from rooftops and shot like skeet pigeons before they splatted on the pavement below like watermelons (which Spielberg said, while he knew it actually happened, he, rightly, didn't want to show it), this film is by no means soft.  It is the definitive telling of one of the most horrible times in human history, and, I agree with everyone else here, it should be shown in grade school, to kids, some of whom are bullies, as that is where intolerance begins, to nip this in the bud for future generations, so that this kind of atrocity never happens again.<br /><br />Brilliant.  Genius.  A grisly, mostly black-and-white masterpiece.  A lighted candle in the dark.  A must see.  Steven Spielberg and all else involved in bringing this darkness to light on the screen, have earned their angel wings in heaven.

B003TXSF5C|4.0|Noting how Pope John XXI was killed by gravity--the roof of his palace fell in--a few months after he condemned the \\"heresy\\" that \\"nature follows laws\\" instead of an omnipotent God is a typically bold way these authors favor to contrast the traditional with the progressive view. (loc. 233 e-book) Hawking and Mlodinow emphasize in the second paragraph, unsurprisingly if perhaps rashly, that philosophy is dead. They cheer on what began with the Ionian thinkers who started to investigate what led them beyond a \\"human-centered\\" understanding towards what M-theory now hints at may be a \\"grand design\\"-- but not necessarily a grand unified theory. I write this a couple of days after the Higgs Boson is said to be verified, and we may be inching closer, 2500 years later, to discoveries anticipated here.<br /><br />I'm no scientist, but I do enjoy popularizations of cosmology as well as rational vs. theological accounts of the Big Questions. I keep an open mind and I sought out \\"The Grand Design\\" to see if I could handle this version--of how progress began and where it's led us--better than the math in \\"A Brief History of Time,\\" which simplified as it was overwhelmed me. My review sets the main points out and I will convey (if as a layman) how well they are explained.<br /><br />During chapter two taking you along the history of physics, as to how laws of nature were defined despite the papacy, we learn how those advocating miracles, the suspension of laws, insisted the exceptions to these universal rules. Laplace, removing God from the picture Newton had drawn, formulated \\"scientific determinism.\\" Cartesian philosophy sought to find out if free will persisted for humans, or whether determinism ruled. The authors side with a neural origin for behavior, not an outside agency such as a divine power. What is less easy to verify is a prediction, given multiples of trillions of variables, however. This combination of confidence and caution again is far from unexpected for a physicist to assert.<br /><br />Hawking and Mlodinow commence their in-depth advocacy from the concept of determinism, with no miracles or exceptions to the laws of nature. They present how the laws arose and consider if they are the only possible ones. Chapter Three asks \\"What Is Reality?\\" \\"There is no picture- or theory-independent conception of reality.\\" A \\"model-dependent realism\\" gives a framework of math-based model and a set of rules to observe. Reality of a model is not the point, but whether a model agrees with observation, our perception of objects. They use the evolution of theories about light to illustrate this.<br /><br />Chapter Four, \\"Alternative Histories,\\" enters into quantum mechanics. and the now-familiar co-existence with Newtonian laws.<br />The double-slit experiment works at a sub-atomic level, sure, but it does not have much of an immediate impact on everyday life. Quantum physics by reflecting a \\"fundamental randomness in nature\\" allows probabilities \\"of various futures and pasts\\" instead of determining them \\"with certainty.\\" It's shorter than Brian Greene's detailed version in \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" (see my reviews of that and Jim Holt's \\"Why Do We Exist\\" July 2012 and compare Lawrence Krauss' \\"A Universe From Nothing\\" Aug. 2012), but Mlodinow and Hawking feel less convincing than Greene about driving home why this discovery matters so.<br /><br />Mlodinow's legendary predecessor at Caltech, Richard Feynman, invents a theory of \\"sum over histories\\" to show how particles can take all paths at once, if the slits are open. It also shows how Newtonian physics can arise from quantum physics. All possible histories thus construct the probability of an observation. This leads to no single past or history for the universe itself.<br /><br />Chapter Five applies this concept to everything. Electro-magnetic forces enter. Maxwell's equations that govern the modes of transmission of this message from me to you then open into Einstein's relativity, intogravity and space-time. The challenge a century later comes in how to find field theories: \\"quantum versions of all the laws of nature.\\" QED's processes via Feynman diagrams assist scientific calculation of how electrons can play off each other with an electromagnetic force. But, \\"this plague of infinities\\" can be hard to handle. QCD comes in to help; Grand Unified Theories appear so far not to pan out in tiny details, so a standard ad hoc model's accepted. Supersymmetry and supergravity are posited as scientists try to work around the impasse.<br /><br />Then, string theory arrives, if in five versions. M-theory may help, but we may be stuck with theories for different versions of reality by \\"model-dependent realism,\\" and some overlap, as with a Mercator map of regions combined to cover the whole globe in a flat dimension, to use the authors' earlier analogy. M-theory lets us have different (10 to the 500th power) universes with their own laws, \\"depending on how the internal space is curled.\\"<br /><br />\\"Choosing Our Universe\\" for the sixth chapter looks closer at our origin story, the Big Bang. Creation for cosmologists cognizant of quantum theory cannot match Einstein's general relativity, as the breakdown back into Planck size of the universe just after the Bang must be accepted. Time vanishes then, and only 4-d space existed. (For all the otherwise refreshing lack of formulas, figures of Planck time vs. Planck space would have assisted this necessary distinction of the two states. Oddly, both terms are absent from the glossary.)<br /><br />Therefore, if time behaves like space, \\"it removes the age-old objection\\" to not only a beginning to the universe, but it shows how the laws of science and not a prime mover as God account for the origin. (I am on a long wait list for Lawrence Krauss' 2012 \\"A Universe from Nothing,\\" which may take a similar rationale, although many religious believers assert that this thinking merely replaces one Mover with a set of Moving Laws, and leaves the question unresolved if the origin remains a \\"spontaneous\\" event.) Hawking and Mlodinow take this on with less vigor than I expected, frankly, and remain content to attest that given the lack of a \\"single definite history\\" for the universe within Feynman's limitless array of probable multiverses, the replacement of a \\"bottom-up\\" model with a \\"probability amplitude\\" suffices as a simpler (!) explanation.<br /><br />They segue 3/4 of the book through into a \\"top-down\\" provocative application of the Feynman sum and the denial of independent existences outside of observation as \\"We create history by our observation, rather than history creating us\\" without sufficiently elaborating the multiverse approach as better than a single history one for cosmology. I get their point, but it seems to lack emphasis. Teasing out the \\"probability amplitude,\\" they argue that each universe has different laws and values with allowance for \\"all possible internal spaces.\\" Fine, if our universal laws \\"are not uniquely determined,\\" but this seems strangely anticlimactic, if no GUT is to be found after all. Logic may insist we aren't so special after all, and we have no grand gift awaiting us to unwrap.<br /><br />\\"The Apparent Miracle\\" as a seventh chapter places us in a \\"Goldilocks zone\\" where temperatures are \\"just right.\\" Mlodinow and Hawking discuss the weak and strong anthropic principles, therefore, that attempt to elucidate our serendipity. What they call \\"fine-tuning coincidences\\" in physical laws may never convince believers who assume a divine plan. But as astrophysicists, the authors remain content to replace \\"providential design\\" with a calm if understated (despite the hostility with which many receive its arguments) insistence that if cosmology lifts boundaries and allows multiverses, then this only underlines how many such solar systems exist by the billions out there. We aren't that special after all.<br /><br />The final chapter asks if we must rely on M-theory for the Grand Design. Why is there something and not nothing, what is the meaning of our existence, and why do we have this set of laws and not another? The laws of nature don't miraculously ring out and satisfy these enduring queries. Hawking and Mlodinow predictably deny the Big Questions at least in the answers preferred by Aquinas. They refuse to invoke divine beings. We're trapped in our mental concepts. They use \\"The Game of Life\\" logical set of laws to determine a 2-d universe invented by John Conway in 1970 to demonstrate an analogous situation. \\"Your reality depends on the model you employ.\\"<br /><br />They leap from this game, which gains considerable commentary, back into our world (which created that game!) to show how universal laws (in our universe) spring out of \\"spontaneous creation\\" when gravity's followed back to its origins as a shaper of space-time, and as a balance of positive and negative energy of matter. M-theory remains as the consistent model of \\"the most general supersymmetric theory of gravity.\\" It's as close as Einstein sought to get to a unified theory--I am not sure if it's \\"grand.\\" Abstract logic leads back to the world we see. That's it. This explanation's itself very compressed, however, and raced ahead of me even if it was articulated in basic English.<br /><br />I wanted more, but it appears this is all I'll get.

0765326353|5.0|The important facet of this introduction is that I am attempting to find another book to read. I very much enjoyed the Way Of Kings and particularly the Kaladin plot line. This is a very hefty book in terms of sheer volume. I like to believe it helps to perceive this as three independent stories which intertwine through each of their courses. They are not separate entities, but rather they inform in a way that is helpful to the reader. Keep in mind while following the paths of some characters there is a bit of wall between them and ultimately they only interact with the reader. I feel this is a little more preferential then simply feeding tons and tons of details directly to the reader and it works to build the world from multiple angles.<br /><br />Returning to my original point in beginning this review I seem to have discovered that any great book is entirely objective. I say this after a great deal of effort searching for something else and finding a plethora of angry Robert Jordan followers who have crossed over to the Sanderson world. This book is probably not for you if that is the case. It doesn't have nearly enough skirts and Sanderson fails to re-introduce the characters a half dozen times. (I jest!) A better comparison, I think Jordan really likes to build to an epic climax in a rather quick battle sequence. Sanderson tends really just pour action on the proverbial pancakes and doesn't stop until the bottle is empty. (Some people don't like that much syrup. Not me! I want to just dip a bit of pancake into a bowl of Aunt Jemima's best!)<br /><br />In closing, if really like pancakes with syrup you will probably like this book and iHop. If you are not really all that into syrup and feel Denny's is the way to go you may want to skip it. I hope that helps clear up any confusion out there! (Waffle House people... you need to look into this great series called Harry Potter)
B005LAIH2W|5.0|From the very beginning until the end, I was captivated by this film!<br /><br />The special effects were very well done and dialogue was easily followed. I didn't get lost or bored along the way, as with too many other \\"action\\" films out there. By the end, I was thoroughly disgusted by all the critics who slammed this film, yet grateful for all the people who actually saw the film and heaped generous and well-deserved praise upon it. This film is evidence that professional film critics are not the last word in whether a movie is good or bad, but the average movie-goer remains the ultimate judge of such things.<br /><br />I look forward with great hopes for a sequel.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|The thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield sent to my kindle from amazon.com which I find to be absolutely the fastest and most convenient way to purchase, read your favorite books. The story is set in early twentieth century England and spans several generations of the same family. It's replete with mystery, deception, intirgue, illusion and dark, twisted modes of behavior.<br /><br />The story opens with our main character, Margaret, who has happily spent the greater part of her life in her father's antique book store; her whole life surrounded by her beloved books. She not only loves to read she revers books.<br /><br />All her free time is spent in her little bedroon, on the top floor of her father's shop, reading her precious books. Many times reading until nearly dawn. Then her life changes irrevocably when she receives a letter addressed to her personally. Rare!<br /><br />This letter is from the famous author, Vida Winters, asking Margaret to write her real and true biography. She hesitates answering it. After all she is not a writer. She decides to reject the offer. However, after reconsidering she recants and accepts the challenge. She goes by train for an interview after which she consents to Miss Winter's demands but, makes a few demands herself. Miss Winters reluctantly agrees and Margaret becomes the reluctant sleuth. During this journey Margaret discoves many mysteries including her own dark and secret story.<br /><br />Margaret embarks on a roller coaster ride of mystery, intrigue, and decption. She finds herself in a labyrinth where she encounters many different characters embodying various degrees of love, hate and many different levels of perversity. Emphasis on PERVERSITY.<br /><br />I don't think the reader will be disappointed. Just find a cozzy corner, curl up, open and begin this adventure into a world that is as dark as it is mysterious. The uncovering of emotions and discovery one encounters makes this book a good read. I just loved it and in the future I will read it again and again.<br /><br />Dorothy Pardo<br />bookworm etc<br />Cuernavaca, Mexicothe future I will read it again and again.<br /><br />Dorothy Pardo<br />bookworm etc<br />Cuernavaca, Mexico

0345803485|1.0|Here in a nutshell is the story (no spoilers here as nothing really happens in the book):<br /><br />Girl bites her lip constantly, guy gets turned on and they have vanilla sex.<br />Girl rolls her eyes at guy, he gets mad and turned on at the same time, they have vanilla sex.<br />Every other page or so, she utters \\"Holy (expletive)!\\"<br />Girl goes on a trip to see her mother (this is perhaps the most exciting thing that happens in the book as it is a least a break from the lip biting/eye rolling blather).<br /><br />All of this could have been wrapped up in >100 pages. Why was it stretched out to 500? Like I said, nothing happens in this book.

1250000971|2.0|After reading Only Time Will Tell,  I immediately ordered The Sins of the Father (second in the Clifton Chronicle trilogy). Although both narratives moved right along, both stopped without any conclusion/resolution at all. To reach the \\"end,\\" it was necessary to get the next book. I jumped at the chance for #2 (The Sins), purchasing it before it was released. However, I was once again frustrated that when the book ended, there was no conclusion to the story to wrap up the plot. In fact, it was so frustrating to fall for such a cheap ploy twice that I will not purchase the last book. Mr. Archer should have honed his \\"historic novel\\" craft better with this series!<br /><br />Most trilogies are complete books that attract the readers' interest enough that he/she looks forward to \\"seeing\\" the same characters in another adventure, often in a similar plot or adding another chapter to the story. BUT, the first book is an entity in and of itself, not just a third of a book that cut the narrative off without reaching a conclusion.<br /><br />Archer knows this writing medium well as he perfected it with Kane and Abel and its sequel. But, both of the first two Clifton Chronicles simply stop, leaving the reader hanging with few threads of the story concluded...and pick up once you spend the money to purchase his next book. Cheap shot, Mr. Archer! You know better and should stop trading on your reputation by abusing your readers' trust. I've always been a big fan but won't soon put my money on your future books.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|Critics panned this movie for not being up to \\"their\\" standards, but in theaters all across America the real critics cheered and came out of the theater holding their heads a little higher.<br /><br />I bought the Blu-Ray version and advise that you watch the special features and interviews before the feature film if you do the same. If you are a person who likes commentary tracks, the directors really break down the movie scene-for-scene, talking about the hardships and fun they had in filming. They really opened up the movie to me. To them, this wasn't just a movie, this was a labor of love.<br /><br />The low budget aspect of the movie does show through; they are NOT actors, there are places where the script does NOT flow well, and there is too much jargon. Two of these three are what make the movie so real.<br /><br />The \\"R\\" rating comes from the blood-splatter caused by instant take-down head shots, scenes of torture, and the occasional cuss word.<br /><br />For parents who want their children to see the movie, I would advise them to see the movie first and judge their children on an individual basis and then watch the movie with them.<br /><br />The most powerful scenes of this movie are not the ones involving combat and shooting, but rather the hardship of the families.

B003TH2LA8|1.0|I had never heard of this program or the book on which it is supposedly based. I came across it while wandering through the TV programs section. While I did not read the reviews, I did read the background to the story and told myself, why not? I watched the extended first episode of the first series and I was rather impressed. It had all the makings of leading in to a good series. Unfortunately, I then watched episode 2 and any thought of this becoming a good series went out the window. However, not being one to give up easily, I also watched episode 3 and by the end of that, I had seen enough. The dialogue was childish, the actors \\"over acted\\" frequently and not even the poorly executed \\"slo mo\\" fight scenes were going to save this program. Like I said, \\"in the beginning\\" it had the potential of making a good series.  Perhaps the makers of this program should have just left the first extended episode as a TV mini-movie and left it at that.

B004FLIXVS|5.0|If you've gone to a Pearl Jam concert, you know the energy these guys play with.<br /><br />The first track is a Joe Strummer cover and it kicks serious ass. If you're a Pearl Jam mark, every single new track or cover you come along means that you'll smile at your band doing the original proud. Highlights in this track go to Mike McCready's riff and the excellent rhythm section of maestros Cameron and Ament. Without missing a beat, in flows World Wide Suicide, punchier than the album version. The punches don't stop and one of the true highlights in the album is the live version of Got Some. Matt Cameron shows why he's one of the best drummers in rock and roll and the track just begs you to want to jump around. The impressive thing is that even on this song, the live version has more energy than the recorded version, and that's saying something.<br /><br />The set continues with State of Love and Trust and there's a reason why this is a fan favorite, just listen. Then you have I am Mine which is the best drinking song Pearl Jam has ever written (a personal take obviously since the lyrics have NOTHING to do with drinking). Afterwards, another track from the last album comes into the setlist in Unthought Known, a track that grows and grows until becoming an optimistic behemoth to further facilitate the communion of Pearl Jam fans. Following is another true highlight in this fantastic set, a version of Rearviewmirror with a musical breakdown that starts near the two minute mark with an improvised chant, drumming licks, great bass lines and a three guitar attack that has to be among their finest live highlights. Then you have a great rendition of The Fixer (one of the few instances where I think the recorded version has more energy than the live version), but is no less impressive.<br /><br />Then you have Mike McCready tear the solos from Nothing as It Seems (3 total), reminding you that Binaural is one of those PJ albums that some people overlooked, but that they shouldn't have. Afterwards comes one of my fav tracks off Yield, In Hiding in a great rendition that truly showcases how uplifting this band can be on some of their best tracks. Once that gem including some crowd participation ends, in comes Just Breathe, a beautiful song off the new album that shows Eddie Vedder traversing terrain more akin to his solo outing for the Into the Wild soundtrack, backed up by his band friends and a string section to take the song to the next level.<br /><br />Then their biggest hit comes into the setlist, a song that has been largely absent from major live releases up until the Gorge Boxset. Jeremy still soars and shows that this band has gone their own route from the getgo. And then, in typical Pearl Jam fashion, they follow up their greatest hit with an obscure track from PiD titled Public Image followed up by a blistering rendition of Spin the Black Circle and the ever live classic of Porch. Simply put, if you've never heard Porch live, you're missing out BIG TIME. Pretty much everyone goes crazy and push the frenzy way beyond the limit. To close the set, two absolute gems grace Live on Ten Legs, The epic Alive and one of their best closers, Yellow Ledbetter.<br /><br />Yet again, Pearl Jam proves that they have more muscle in their metaphorical music pinky than most bands have in a career and that the spirit of The Who still lives strong in one of the greatest American Bands ever to explode onstage.
B005LAII1C|1.0|As a parent of a child that had cancer, I really don't think the cancer comments in this movie are funny or necessary.  \\"TED' says \\"no peeking, or you will get childhood cancer isn't even funny.  Writers could have picked something that people don't actually die from, like no peeking or you'll get a boil on your butt.  Also another cancer reference in the movie too.  I guess it's funny, until it happens to you or someone you know.  And yeah, I take it too seriously.
B004NSULHM|4.0|With Radiohead, every single album has been a rewarding experience in itself, including the band shunned Pablo Honey, the oddly overlooked Hail to the Thief and the misunderstood and under-appreciated Amnesiac. From Pablo Honey I can mention Blow Out, Everyone can Play Guitar and the most epic Stop Whispering as songs that truly hold water and really are satisfying with each subsequent listen. From Amnesiac you have Like Spinning Plates, Knives Out, Pyramid Song, Packt Like Sardines in a Tin Can and the quietly angry You and Whose Army. From Hail to the Thief there's the excellent opener 2 + 2 = 5, the beautiful Sit Down Stand Up, There There, I will, the creepy We Suck Young Blood and the wonderful closer A Wolf At the Door.<br /><br />That last paragraph is simply to establish that even a \\"weak\\" Radiohead album probably contains some of the best music you will hear in a year, a decade or maybe your life. So where does The King of Limbs figure in all of this? If I had to describe based on previous albums, think of Kid A and In Rainbows having a love child and I think that's what King of Limbs is to me. It is its own monster and an album that for 37 minutes doesn't let up. Actually the opening track sounds like Radiohead channeling a tribute to Gustavo Cerati's Tabú from his second album Bocanada, but it sounds nothing like it. There are drum loops and there are electronic bleeps, but it's all hauntingly organic. Unlike Kid A that felt like the existential cry of a sapient robot, The King of Limbs starts off with something that plays equally well in your mind with fast forwarded footage or things going in slow motion because it does both at the same time. It unravels, growing into a ghostly beauty that sets the overall tone for the album.<br /><br />If I had to describe the vibe present in the King of Limbs, I think the video for Lotus Flower describes it perfectly. It's you waking up on a chilly Sunday morning in a life that might seem bleak, but that it is not hopeless. Everything is black and white. The tea you are sipping is delicious and you can't help but dance in your underwear throughout your entire house. It's got a shoulder sway to it in various songs that invites everyone to not care and let the beats dictate where your body leans to. Morning Mr. Magpie does nothing to change this vibe. You still want to dance in ordinary places like a bank line and show people that you don't give a flying, landed, or swimming F____. Music reigns supreme and this music tells you to move. You see hints of all past albums painting a pastiche that is all its own. A different dish with familiar ingredients and something secret added to the mix.<br /><br />Then Little by Little fades in and you feel echoes of Amnesiac peeking from around the corner. In reality, it's a devil track dressed up in an Amnesiac suit. It's got the tailor lines, but moves to its own rhythm, it's subtle in its composition and doesn't scream \\"look at me\\" but if you listen closely there are so many layers to the track that thinking anyone else could make a song like this means you think Coldplay is the greatest band ever. To be honest, if any track really lets you know that this is an album that you should also listen to with headphones, it's Little by Little because it sounds simple if you don't pay attention. Feral then swings by to continue urging you to move your limbs, walk with a beat and feel as well as listen. Basically memories of Kid A play on a track that could easily make its way onto a dance floor and afterwards comes the first album single. The music video is quite unlike anything I've ever seen by Radiohead and although it's not my favorite video, if anything it captures the essence of the entire album with just Thom Yorke dancing in black and white. Elaborating more would be counterproductive, so just put your headphones on and dance if your body wants to, it quite possibly will.<br /><br />Then comes Codex, a slow song that unfolds itself at its own pace. It's a break in the overall danceable feel to the album and if anything, it feels as if you have just danced your way up to a cliff without realizing it and now you're looking to the horizon and taking a moment to contemplate. You are looking down at the rocks below, wonder about a million things, sit down and cradle your warmest thoughts, your saddest feelings and resolve to accept whatever is in your tank. It's quite haunting but it doesn't feel as immersed in despair as some other Radiohead tracks like I will or Bulletproof I wish I was. The seventh track has you coming down from that cliff and is surprisingly airy and lighthearted given that the entire song repeats the verse (Don't hurt me) throughout. Maybe it has to do with the duo of acoustic and electric guitars but it's a song that feels uplifting and it's a lovely bit that leads into the final track, Separator. The funny thing is that this track does with this album as the other songs do with other Radiohead albums. It's not that it sounds out of place, it's just that it sounds as if it's taking what was built in the first 7 tracks and is starting to head into a different direction which truly prompts the belief that the lyrics may actually reveal intentions from the band... simply put: if we think this is over, then we're wrong.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|I was super excited to receive this item, we tried to use it for the fourth of july holiday but it did not hold any air.  Not happy.  On top of that, I guess I only had until July 1st for a refund.  Guess I am sol...
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|The end of a band, the end of an era? Who knows? What I do know is that Collapse Into Now is as solid an REM album as I think they've ever done. Seriously. It's that ridiculously good. The amazing thing is that even in an album that has hooks to spare, more memorable tracks than you care to admit and an energy absent from many an R.E.M. album, it's their Swan Song. It's their goodbye... and dammit, if there's any way to say goodbye, these guys pulled it off.<br /><br />For believing albums are dead, R.E.M. have put out one of their best ever. Even more so, something I really think needs to be said about this album is that unlike most R.E.M. albums, Collapse Into Now doesn't have their typical mid-album slump (something also very apparent in their last outing Accelerate). But if anything, I think R.E.M.'s reaction to the album is interesting because although in interviews they almost sounded as if they're full of it, they played on the album with as much f%^& you conviction as ever. Actually, it often sounds like they're having a really good time.<br /><br />True, many lyrics may have them taking the role of curmudgeonly journeymen talking to \\"the kids\\", but if that's my main complaint of this album... then I'll take it, because at 31, I often feel completely out of sync with lots of things that are happening nowadays and the music here says that loud and clear. Whatever you're doing now, we're not interested, this is how we rock.<br /><br />Collapse Into Now maintains the focus seen on Accelerate, but a hell of a lot of variety has been added to the mix to offer up a great solid collection of songs that lyrically, musically and thematically matter. Peter Buck even pulled out the mandolin to reminisce on greener and less socially-networked pastures of the days of old.<br /><br />Great lyrics, good choruses and impressively so, one of the most intelligible I've ever heard Michael Stipe. Although the interviews and the album title might project a sense of pessimism andnihilistic tendencies towards their relevance, Collapse Into Now is the work of great musicians, making great music just for the hell of it apparently.

B000TEUSJK|2.0|\\"What shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul\\" Mark 8:36<br /><br />The Blu-ray treatment really brings out the visuals of naked women and white horses.<br /><br />I have to confess this type of film is not my cup of tea. I just wanted to see a young version of many famous actors. Introductive music sounds an awful like Serguei Prokofiev was not only an accomplished composer of the twentieth century.<br /><br />I am surprise that mixed with all the phony debauchery there is a real story. This is the only thing that brings it up a notch from \\"Fellini Satyricon\\" (1969)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this series  and  could not stop reading. However, like every book some parts get a little slow and certain aspects get repetitive. However, it is still one of the better series that I have read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I started reading this book out of curiosity to see what all the fuss was about and was appalled with the whole thing.  I read about half of it and was thoroughly disgusted.  There is no story to it, it's all hard core porn as far as I am concerned.  I don't consider myself a prude by any stretch, but this book is not worth the paper it is printed on.  with so many good stories and talented authors out there, don't waste your time on this!
B003N0XDT4|2.0|I bought this device to crank up the sound on my Headphones while mowing my grass on a riding mower, as well as to amplify sound for the headphones for my kids while flying in a private small airplane.  I should have listened to some of the other reviews:  THEY DO NOT AMPLIFY THE SOUND.  There is NO audible volume difference that I can tell between using it with or without the device.  Thank Heaven's amazon allows returns.  In addition, the one I received had some small scratches on the face . . .  I suspect I'm one of many that have returned the product. Can't say if they make the sound better, I'm not that savvy. I just wanted to hear the music louder.

0393080269|4.0|This was quite informative. In many respects it reminded me of articles in the Economist. It doesn't go in to all that much depth but the author does offer evidence for his opinions and it does sound quite convincing when you are actually reading it.<br />It was also similar to the economist in that the thinking in this book is very conventional.<br /><br />I would have liked much more detail and the author seems far too convinced of the likelihood of his predictions coming true.<br /><br />Despite these flaws I did get quite a bit out of this and it is well argued.

0307730697|5.0|To My Sons,<br /><br />The story of Adam Brown is about learning to love others more than you love yourself.  Adam Brown is a Navy SEAL who was killed in Afghanistan while attacking an enemy compound.  His story is important because it shows how people can redeem themselves and that being a Christian does not mean you are weak.  I've often thought about how to live as a Christian man and how to over come my many short comings. Adam's story demonstrates that faith is for everyone and that when you forget yourself you become Fearless.<br /><br />\\"Nothing can take my spirit from me, exclude your spirit, let it shine for all to see.\\"  Adam Brown<br /><br />Adam discovered faith when he was in jail.  He had hit rock bottom, living in crack houses and robbing his friends and parents to pay for his crack addiction.  With nothing but the clothes on his back and support from family and friends who still supported him Adam turned away from his addiction and put all his trust in Christian faith.  Adam learned to trust in the Lord with all his heart and in all his ways acknowledged him.  He went to Christian rehab, became a speaker for faith and after having a few setbacks joined the Navy to become a SEAL.<br /><br />The key lesson Adam learned during this time was that you can overcome many things in life, including injuries and setbacks. Just come back more determined and try harder.  This lesson served him well during his career and helped him overcome multiple career ending injuries.<br /><br />You do what is right every time, not matter what.<br /><br />As a Christian Adam knew that God is watching us all the time.  Knowing this Adam became a Christian warrior.  While on deployment in AFG Adam shared his food and give shoes to kids, making a lasting positive impression even on the enemy.  He also helped the lower ranking guys with the trash, remember God is watching ALL the time not just when others are watching you.  Showing his respect of others no matter what the rank or social standing.  He said being a Christian made his life easier as because it gave him a high standard to live by and only gave him the choice to do the right thing.<br /><br />What did I learn from this book and how will I use it?<br /><br />I love reading books about great people, and this book was more instructive than most.  Adam was a real person  with more faults than others.  But unlike most people he was able to overcome himself to learn to care for others more than he cared for himself.  This made him great.  This is why he was a beloved person in his community and how he made a difference.  Being a member of the SEALs wasn't he greatest accomplishment.  Adam true mission was to show that faith is for the strong and the weak.  He was weak when he discovered Christ, but it wasn't until he was strong that he could learn to live the disciplined and joyous life as a Christian.  I have used this book a stepping stone in my own journey of faith.  I know that Christians aren't weak, they are strong, forceful and Fearless.
B00110K62U|5.0|Les Miserables is amazing no matter where or who sings it. However, this is truly the best performance on tape. The music is stellar and the sound is really good as well/ I wish they would put this edition out on Blu-ray. Overall it is worth the money.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The keyboard is pretty good overall however it doesn't work in most search fields.    According to their website [...] the problem isn't their app but all other apps that have search fields.

B007P06DO0|4.0|My wife and I are big Simon and Garfunkel fans. We have every CD by them together and solo. My wife is from mainland China and did not grow up on this music like I did. Paul's music transcends borders and helps to bring the world closer together. On the box set: I bought Graceland on cassette tape when it came out in the 80s, then bought the CD (with bonus tracks a few years ago). The DVDs are excellent, the booklet is informative and the lyrics note pad makes a good primary source for the lyrics. The biggest problem I have with this set is the lack of new material. There really is only two instrumental backing tracks added as bonus material (plus a short Live in Spain CD Amazon exclusive-thank god, but not much). How about a studio jam with the players just working though material, surly their must be some more working tapes in the vault. If you are a super fan (like me) and have everything from Tom and Jerry to So Beautiful So What buy it, and make it a part of your collection. On another note if you get a chance to see Paul Simon in concert, do it, one of the best shows I have ever seen (I have seen many since the 70s) and the man is 70 yrs old.
0345529057|5.0|This series will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you read it!!! The characters are diverse and complex...it is a masterpiece!
B002LC8HF0|2.0|I've never written a review for a book before.  Usually I don't care enough either way.  This time I feel strongly enough to write one.  I started off the Mistborn series feeling impressed by Sanderson's attention to detail and the complexity and originality of the magic system that he implemented.  I mean sure, the characters were a little flat and the dialogue was a little inane, but hey, it was better than most of the things being published lately.  I finished the first book in one sitting and rushed to purchase the second.  About 1/4 of the way through the second book (Well of Ascension) I began to feel as if I had been cheated.  The book was LONG, more importantly, it was UNNECESSARILY LONG.  There was entirely too much introspection, too much repetition and almost no action.  With all that introspection, the characters should have felt more developed, more real.  They didn't.  I found myself wanting to slap both Elend and Vin in the face and tell them to get over themselves.  The most interesting characters in my opinion were Vin's kandra and Sazed (although in book three Sazed becomes just as whiny and self-absorbed as Elend is in both books).  Book three was unfortunately more of the same.  Much, much, much more of the same.  It was actually excruciatingly painful to read.  There were times that I put the book down and walked away for days.  There were times that I skimmed through entire chapters looking for anything of interest in the story.  The ONLY reason that I finished is because I have an obsessive need to finish any series that I start.  It is my heartfelt opinion that if all of the filler were cut out, books two and three could have been combined into a story that was actually interesting.  In my opinion, the only reason that these are two separate books is the fantasy world's current obsession with the trilogy.  It's a freaking marketing gimmick and they got over on me.  I honestly wasn't even satisfied with the way that the story ended.  It left me with one eyebrow in the air and an incredibly sarcastic \\"really?!\\" on my lips.  If you are thinking about starting the Mistborn trilogy, my advice to you is not to.

B000024T5L|5.0|Undoubtedly most people think of \\"The Final Countdown\\" when they think of Europe. However, i'm here to tell you \\"Prisoners in Paradise\\" is by far the better album. Almost forgotten by most hard rock fans by 1991, Europe did their best to make an outstanding melodic rock record.<br /><br />It's an absolute shame this album never achieved a greater level of success for these guys. This is without question their finest hour, and easily one of my favorite records from the genre. We all know what Europe sounded like from past efforts, but it seems like on \\"Prisoners in Paradise\\" they tightened up their sound and wrote some killer rock songs. It seems to me that Europe could have released any of these songs as singles, and had decent success, minus the fact that it was '91 and nobody cared anymore. \\"All Or Nothing\\", \\"Halfway To Heaven\\", \\"Prisoners in Paradise\\", \\"Got Your Mind In The Gutter\\" and \\"Little Bit Of Lovin'\\" are all favorites, but honestly there isn't a bad song in the batch.<br /><br />If you like Europe or anything from the 80's, you'll love this record completely. Heck, if like melodic rock in any capacity you'll enjoy this album.

0606259090|1.0|As one who is a happily collared submissive, I found the most important parts of the BDSM  relationship completely missing. Missing are the deep emotions and complex balance that is required in a true and mature BDSM relationship. It has been turned into a one dimensional literary tactic. I find it sad that the only insight most of the common public will ever have of 'the lifestyle' is what's in this series. And I fear that because of it, many will have a misguided understanding of what the lifestyle is about.<br />I realize the author is writing about a subject she has limited knowledge of. But I suppose that is precisely my point. It is always best to write about what you know. And while I respect and admire the time and effort she must have put into these books, she still got it wrong.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The theme was a little  silly but it was pleasant and easy to read. I had never heard of a Rose Gardner mystery but wouldn't mind reading when more they are available.<br /><br />I purchased \\" Twenty Eight Wishes\\" from Amazon as a Kindle E book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Overall, this novel is not only an excellent courtroom drama, but is even a better examination of the loyalty which exists within the family dynamic. As a father, I know that there is no end to what I would do to aid my children and further that I have infinite faith in them as human beings. I found it entirely easy to identify with the gauntlet of emotions which Andy Barber had to face in this novel. Who among us could imagine our children being guilty of a crime as horrific as murder? Mr. Landay takes us on a journey through a murder trial from the perspective of the family of the accused. We are made to see how the stress affects the family in complete detail. The thought processes of each parent as the tension mounts and the community ostracizes them are made very palpable.<br /><br />Aside from the familial aspect, there is of course the matter of a murder to be solved. Plenty of the usual action and subterfuge in this regard, as well as some eyebrow raising events. It's very easy to recommend this novel as I found myself becoming emotionally invested with its characters readily. Well written and presented, this book will linger in your thoughts after completion.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Everyone was making it all about sex but it had a good story line.  What people failed to realize and if they are honest with themselves if they wrote down every explicit detail about their sex life and I mean every detail, it would probably this book.  Well maybe minus the S/D thing but every thing else.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Maybe the fact that this is my favorite Maiden album could bias my opinion on it, so I'll steer away from reviewing the quality of the songs.<br />It was a surprise to see some labels saying \\"Brand new Maiden album\\" when I first received the package. This is a 2000 album, so it's 12 years old. Definitely not a brand new album, but it felt like I was going back in time upon reading those labels.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|Really entertaining game, keeps your attention and its tough to put down, not too frustrating either, my kids love it too, especially in church.
B008FH6SUQ|5.0|I love the entire album. He reminded me of how much I love hip-hop, since previously I'd been in an indie/ alternative rock/ electronic/ dub-step phase due to my inability to find good, contemporary hip-hop. You can tell he sings each of his songs from the heart, and that really communicates to the listener. He extracts my emotions on a different level with each respective song. I just think he's really great!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I just finished reading Sijin Belle's hilarious [[ASIN:0970115776 Big Chicken]]which I was lured to by her mock review \\"Another lurid addition to wacko crime and zany murder fiction, to be avoided at all costs by the serious reader.\\" Jonathan Fanzeni. So when I saw that Tina had an endorsement from Mark Twain how could I resist? \\"Do not print this glowing recommendation of Tina Fey's book until I've been dead a hundred years.\\" (Mark Twain )<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed her story from Second City to SNL though I wish she had revealed a little bit more about her guest hosts than she did but burning bridges isn't the soundest career path. Her moments of candor, especially writing about her dad, were endearing and when she gets on a tear she is very, very funny.

B002WY65VU|5.0|Bought this movie because I saw it once and couldn't get it out of my head. Though it contains crude language and graphic and gorey images, it's truly hilarious and the price was good too. Service was great- it arrived before the expected delivery date and it was in excellent condition except for a small tear in the paper behind the cover, but I'm not too picky. The DVD was in mint condition and I'm confident my money was well spent.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is a must see for anyone who has followed the series. Not sure what season 5 will bring, but will be hard to top season 4. Excellent!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game is not fun and the controls barley work plus the ads get in the way of playing also it takes forever to unlock the games and they aren't even fun. Would give it zero stars if I could.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|[[ASIN:B0031RAOW8 Hachi: A Dog's Tale [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Great movie.  Hollywood needs to take note of these guys. The movie is rated G and it was a great movie to watch.  Sentimental, sure, but a really good story.<br /><br />As others reviewers have written, this movie is based on a popular Japanense true story.<br /><br />Cool Story Bro.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Great, GREAT movie and a superb job by Jim Carey and the entire cast.  Love movies accurately set back in time as is the case here.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great summer read....the book was a riveting page turner, I kept wanting to read and internalize more!  This novel was worth the purchase, suspenseful enjoyment.
B006M4RN3U|1.0|When this album came out, I expected it to be something of a masterpiece, like fun.'s last album Aim & Ignite. I was severely disappointed after listening. I asked myself if they even put in any effort for this album. It's extravagantly bland and forgettable, while Aim & Ignite has so many ear worms, it caught me off guard just exactly how bad they've become. The worst part is, radio stations will not stop playing the WORST song off of the album \\"We are young\\". It almost makes me angry that it's so wildly popular with a large group of people who doesn't know anything about good music, and only listens to the radio. Please, if you are considering buying this album, don't, and go get yourself Aim & Ignite. After you realize how wonderful that album is, go buy The Format's Dog Problems album (the band that is the predecessor to fun.) and you'll understand why Some Nights is some of the laziest lyric writing and musical composition you've ever heard.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Let me start off saying this is a definite must read,I only wish I had read it sooner.It has,vampires,shape shifters,n wiccans.(witches)It is very hard to describe this book,other than Rebecca is a perfectionist when describing her characters.Sophia,the main character tells the story in her words,as a practicing wiccan,who is drawn into a world even she does not believe (at first),but all the same a world she was meant to be in.Her calling you might say.Charles (her now lover)is a shifter,not a werewolf,many animals.Hence the word shifter.She has powers she hasn't even discovered yet.Sound like Twilight,maybe,but not like anything you have read in those books.Sophia is also being sought out by a not so friendly vampire,who wants to turn her.Now,with all that said,there is also love,romance,betrayal,friendship and family.Lots of action,which I love how Rebecca describes,each shift,each vampire vein,fangs n nails.This definitely a one of a kind book,which I hope turns into book 2 very soon!Rebecca,sugar,keep letting me into that marvelous mind of yours.A Highly recommend to all.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really love this game but not as much on the kindle. it freezes alot. but other than that i love it
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this after Fifty Shades & will say I loved it! Better written & I loved the story. Can't wait for book 2 in Oct!
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|This was a great idea ruined. It's a serious subject Hollywooded up to be easily digestable... just like the infamous pie. (Why tricking someone into eating sh!t is supposed to be funny or \\"great revenge\\" is beyond me. It's criminal! I don't care how awful the target is.)<br /><br />All the white women are skinny and ditsy. All the blacks are wise and noble (even when serving their own sh!t). The men are scenery. Where are the illiterate maids who can't tell their stories much less write them down? Where are the smart, intelligent women, who nevertheless give their kids to black women they don't respect to raise? No mention of sexual harassment. Indeed.... did anyone involved in this project ever have a maid?<br /><br />A serious subject that deserves some scrutiny.... Hollywooded up to be trite, nostalgic, and acceptable to whites.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|3 words: SO TOTALLY FUN!! this is a very high tech, futuristic water game. smooth graphics and realistic graphics make it all the better. a definite top game in my book. vector rush has done it once again!
B0086700CM|5.0|the game has a lot of chalages and fun when you pass a level but you are proud of you self when you passnit fun game LOVE IT
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game. Don't start u wont want to stop! Needs more opportunities to get gems or you'll be spending cash trying to advance in the game.
B007V508CC|5.0|I can't see why people are being so harsh about their album. You can't expect an artist to keep playing the same music through their whole career. And you can't expect them to make a perfect album like \\"Songs About Jane\\" again. Do you know how hard it is to top one of the best platinum albums of all time??? Even though it isn't like \\"Songs About Jane\\" it's pretty damn good. I love EVERY single song they have made so far. From the unreleased tracks like \\"Ragdoll\\" to \\"She Will Be Loved\\", \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" and everything in between. I wish people can see how much effort they put into their songs. I will always remain their fan, no matter what they make.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is a really great and fun game my little sister loves it!!!!  it is great enterainment for little kids!!! I enjoy it very much!
B000008GHW|4.0|Yes, all of this has been reissued through Experience Hendrix, but any of the old vinyl LP pressings of \\"Cry of Love\\" are worth seeking out just for the fact that the music has not been tampered with as much.  True, these songs were never finished and who knows what Hendrix was going to do, but all of the later reissued, remastered versions sound digitized and artificial.  Get a turntable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a good game for ice age fans. it will keep kids entertained for awhile. too bad you have to have other people play to really be able to move on.
B000002GY9|5.0|Tom Waits is the real thing, I think everybody should listen to Tom Waits, Tom Waits Rocks! Go man Go!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This is the best pinball for the fire yet!!! Where are all the blocking ads people are talking about? This game is exactly as it should be. No concentration required. Just launch the ball and have as much carefree fun as you want.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|great game to play with many puzzles to choose from but cant stand when it shuffles and you make 1 match and it keeps reshuffling like that
B0076LAF24|5.0|simply amazing experience of a liveset that constantly evolves, its a ride on the electronic side both visual and musical, every fan should watch The Chemical Brothers play live, i had that experience and i will not forget, \\"Dont Think\\" is the closest you can get...
B0086700CM|5.0|my mom and dad have this on there phones. when they r busy on the phone I can play it on my kindle. I love temple run. but there is a few glitches.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Thank you too the developer of this game.  :-) Its a wonderful game my kids enjoy it.  keep up the great job.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|the picture find concept is fun and the story is captivating. thank you for a wonderful game. I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for both daily reading plans and daily devotions. Lots of choices and the ability to save notes and share verses.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This is a soft plastic case, not a hard case like a Speck.  Imagine wrapping a big rubber band around your iPhone.<br /><br />Positives:  Fits ok, comes with a screen protector.  Popularly priced.  Looks fine.  Good enough.<br /><br />Not so positives: Mine is a bit floppy at the cut-outs for the volume and mute button and (to a lesser extent) at the bottom cut-out for the power socket.  The soft plastic can't maintain shape well with that big a hole chopped in it.  This may or may not bother you.<br /><br />Summary:  Good price, it looks fine, and it seems to work.<br /><br />Update, 10 months later:  The clear case will yellow over time.  But it is so inexpensive, just buy another one every 6 months or so. Rating upgraded by a star.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like being able to deal a guaranteed win. Pop up ads not obtrusive and programmers have to eat too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and fast.. keeps kids involved if you need some quiet time activities.  kids love trying to catch scratch.  fun for all ages.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play. some  r boring though. I like the fact you can get more games then other games out there.<br />My daughter likes it too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A lot of the games were great, some good, a few not my type.  BUT I kept coming back! The ones I did not have the skill to win...I had my kids win for me so I could move on (and also accumulate more points to get to the higher level games) I stopped playing for a while but I'm back! I just play my favorite games now.
B004RE29PO|5.0|there is no way you can give this movie anything less than five stars. it's a classic in the true sense of the word. movies today are still trying to copy from it. that tells you something right there.
B00164KYV4|5.0|It's an adorable girl AND GUY friendly film. It's funny and yes romantic, but there as multiple story lines that don't necessarily have to do with romance. I forced my husband to come see it with me and bribed him with free movie ticket and popcorn haha. But guess what?! He really liked it, not keep in mind my husband is a Bull Wrangler for a living. Not a well-dressed cologne expert. He laughed a lot and ended up paying for the popcorn because (I'm gonna quote him here) \\"It ain't bad, I reckon' I'd like ta see it again someday.\\"<br /><br />Anyways, bottom line: It is a funny, romantic, naughty, and vengeful movie. Haha
B005LAIIS0|4.0|seeing Liam kick some wolf ass is pretty fun. it was a very entertaining flick. didn't have to many slow parts, that's always a good thing.
0439023491|3.0|I thought it was alright but too repetitive compared to the first book to the point where I felt like I was rereading the first book again. Nothing new really happens except for the ending but that's about it.
0240815807|5.0|I've been recording and mixing for years - from a Tascam 244 way back in the early '90s, through striped codes on 16 track tapes to digital and endless 'plugins'. I actually have an 1985 edition of Sound-on-sound! Mike's book brings you on the journey of mixing in great detail and clarity, at a pace where you can't put the book down! Every page is full of insight, encouragement to stay the pace and follow his guidelines. He takes a holistic look at mixing - covering not just techniques but also the environment. His experience is extraordinary and yet he doesn't just give his own opinion but includes advice and comment from a great range of experts. I've bought many many books on recording and mixing in the past but this book is the bible of mixing. You won't just read it and put it away - you'll read and re-read because it contains so much useful information, demystifying mixing. To top it off, just when you think you have tapped into a goldmine, you find another door - recommended reading and a treasure trove of links to hone your skill at mixing using audio tracks - it's brilliant. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this series.  Liked the way there was a plot woven through all the episodes  and guessing at the \\"who dunit\\".
B00846REIS|4.0|50 shades of Grey without the bondage and fun room! This book is steamy hot! The descriptions of their passion is unreal! Some of the story line could have been edited out because it got very repetitive at the end.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I think THIS is the best book by Robert Lewis Stevenson. Also the best pirate story ever!!!!!I would rate this book 10000000000000 if I could, but I will just have to rate it 5 star. This is a fiction book.It's a great book if you're looking for a adventure book , but if you're looking for a pirate research book I would recommend you to keep looking.This is not the book.I hope you've learned alot from this comment.Enjoy you're new kindle book!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|What a wonderful album! This is an album that grows on you.  The best kind, right?  Once it does grown on you, it brings such amazing peace.  It's an album that reminds us of who we are, whether we grok it or not.  Everything is one, regardless if our mind agrees or disagrees.<br /><br />From a musical standpoint, I know Jason got into a lot of the Brazilian stuff like Milton Nascimento, bossa nova (Just Be Honest), and samba stuff.  But instead of getting carried away with those amazing Brazilian jazz chords, for most of the album, he kept true to himself, and kept it to basic major and minor chords, staying in one key, keeping bridges in the same key, etc., which actually highlights the simplicity of love, to not over-complicate things.  I wonder if it was a conscious move, or did he just get out of the way.  Either way, it was very wise.  It's such a paradox, that who we truly are, has nothing to do with who we think we are, and I think this is one of those few, courageous albums that will endure for many years.  I have all of his albums, and it's really cool to witness his evolution.<br /><br />I have to disagree with a few of the reviewers that there isn't a \\"radio\\" single on the album.  I think there are several songs that would catch an audience that is ready to listen.  This isn't an album with songs for trendy hype.  It's an album that demands deep listening, which we as a species, are not encouraged to do.<br /><br />Just wish the \\"What Would Love Do Now\\" single was on here.  Doesn't matter, though.  There is enough material here to enjoy and appreciate.  Thanks, Jason.  I play guitar as well.  I love playing your songs on my guitar to my three boys.  Our favorites are \\"Living in the Moment,\\" \\"Everything is Sound,\\" and \\"93 Million Miles.\\" I loooove  \\"5/6,\\" and \\"Just Be Honest,\\" too. Enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app.  Having an interactive Bible app is great fun.  I love the reminders.  I recommend this free app.
B00004RF98|4.0|There was one little skip part way through the dvd but the rest of it was smoothly played. The price I paid for the film was worth every penny as we've watched the movie at least a dozen times since I purchased it. Thanks!
B007WFR1MQ|5.0|I will spare everyone the \\"history\\" of the band as anyone who has been alive for the past twenty years knows they are the kings of industrial metal. The Industrialist is excellent, from the vocals, guitars, bass (both played by Dino) and the mechanical drums. Mechanical drums is how the beast started in 1990 and I'm happy with the end result. It encapsulates the Industrialist theme and pushes the machine vs. man vibe even further. If I had to name the best metal band of all time it would be Slayer, but Fear Factory is number two. The Industrialist helped implant that feeling and if it continues their number could climb to number one for me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|To me, this is one of the finest mystery/crime books I have read.  It would be criminal to discuss the plot points other than to say that if you are only comfortable with Hollywood storylines, you need heroic characters and would prefer to sleep at night, find another book.  I loved Flynn's first two stories, but this ingenious, daring and uncompromising author has out done herself.  Hopefully, Flynn's excellent, confident, insightful writing with inspire other authors and raise the bar on the genre.
030758836X|1.0|I am still angry that I wasted my time and money on this ridiculous book.  Seems like a good plot at the beginning, but soon you find yourself saying over and over again \\"What?\\", \\"No Way!\\".  Totally unbelievable.  I kept reading thinking the author must have a really clever way of wrapping up all the insanity.  There was no wrap up, there was no ending.  All the hateful characters and plot lines just stop.  In the author's acknowledgements she writes that she got stuck when the book was 82% completed, and her editor had to help her finish it.  She should have just stopped at 82%.  I wish there was a way to demand my money back after feeling totally manipulated and ripped off. Don't buy this book!
0606259090|1.0|Like so many others,I read this b/c of the hype and thought there might be some insight into an SM mind. The sex scenes are repetitous, not really erotic, and consume about ever three pages. No story line that ever gets developed but could......and the thought of reading 2 more of exactly the same thing isn't even a possibility. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome Bible app! Its like being able to carry all of my favorite Bible translations and sermon notes everywhere I go.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I first heard about this book on NPR, checked it out a bit later. I loved it! Not just pointing out the way things are done differently but great guidelines for an easier life. I immediately started implementing some of the simple ways to organize your life around you and your child. It was also nice to have her point out the pressures of nursing, natural birth etc.<br /><br />I've always thought that I would want my little friend to enjoy life alongside me, not control my life, and this was a great book to put me on the right track.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|When I'm having a tough day the daily messages pick me up and put me back on track. It is like they are talking to me personally.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and it was wonderful there; as a Blu-Ray in 3D, the theatre experience is faithfully translated.  The 3D effects work very well on the small screen and enhance the story rather than distract or detract from it.  This is definitely one of the better 3D movies to get on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the other reviews here do the movie justice--this is a good, nearly great, movie that should have done much better in the theatres and should have had better reviews.  The world of Barsoom (Mars) is completely and convincingly created and the storyline is interesting.  There's no time to be bored and from the very start, you find yourself cheering for John Carter to meet the Princess and fall in love with her.  The acting is good and the effects are not as cartoonish as the really underwhelming Avatar 3D.<br /><br />Definitely worth purchasing for the home collection-it may not be Citizen Kane, but this is a far better movie than Avatar, a Dances with Wolves ripoff often given high ratings and recommended for home purchase.  I hope that future 3D movies are at least as good as John Carter.
0606259090|1.0|A maverick aka control freak Dominant (Grey) picks a terribly insecure 20 something going on 12 year old woman (Steele) as his submissive thinking she is like minded when in fact she couldn't come any more clueless.  If her stupidity wasn't bad enough, we get the constant interpretation and feeble rationalizations by Steele with her equally inept \\"inner goddess.\\"  She is incapable of sitting back and just enjoying anything; hence, the helicopter ride would have been quite enjoyable if it wasn't for Steel's lame attempts at trying to interpret life.  If it wasn't for foil condom packets and the rolling of eyes, the story would have no plot.  There are three sets:  Grey's house, Steel's apartment, and the parent's house, how's that for exotic ports of call.  She spreads her legs every time Grey makes a booty call, yet refuses to take anything from him......ah, hello stupid.  Take the books, the car, the offer of the personal trainer, and the jet.  Your hymen should be worth at least that and, besides, he can afford it.  This book is an attempt to bring the world of BDSM into the main stream by mating The Story of O with Romancing the Stone and the off spring suffers from failure to thrive without the help of it's inner goddess.  From the perspective of Vanilla Steele, we \\"experience\\" the Red Room of Pain like it was red velvet cake ready to attack the waistline.  I shudder at the thought.  Instead of sizing Grey up as a guy with too much money, too many toys, and a lot of kinkzpah, we get her amateur psycho analysis of Grey's post traumatic sex disorders.  Miss Steele, maybe Grey doesn't want you to touch him because he's just not into it.  If the book wasn't on my Kindle, I'd whip the hell out of it for being so bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its nothing crazy fancy .its just a great card game app. you can change the background and the decks, which is fun.  but over all I love it :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I must say this book was interesting and educational.  I could not put the book down.  However, I cannot give this book a rating of five stars because it was very repetitive and slightly annoying at times.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|ADDICTED!! My husband wanted this but now I'm a fan. Have always loved Joss Whedon and this was another good one. Sad there wasn't more!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|this game keeps me going for hours. I just wish it had more depth. I am still giving 5 stars
B005COO1X6|5.0|bought Mile 81 very interesting made me want to keep reading it.makes you think hard about rest areas.love all of stephen kings books
0739334026|5.0|This book is great the audio is done just right and i am definitely going to listen to this book again!
0316133930|5.0|We bought the book used and it was in really good condition. The seller shipped it to us in no time at all.  The book was great also. Would recommend to any age of readers....
B000SEGUDE|2.0|This book is Avatar for literature. It looks really good, everyone says it's really good because everyone's reading it. But it's crap. As you read you see it's really just a treatise against Western Civilization and capitalism. It's white guilt alternate history. But you keep reading because you think it's going to come together in the end and you want to know how it works out. But when it's over you know you figured it out halfway through, there isn't any clever twist, and you just spent a lot of time with a bunch of characters you don't care about anyway. So the only takeaway is the feeling of having been well and truly scolded by a precocious but ill informed child. Irritating, to say the least. I read a lot of books in multiple genres. In my long literary life there are only a handful of books I couldn't finish or wish I'd never read. This just hit the top of the list. You want a good mystery? Read Agatha Christie. You want to know what everyone's talking about? Read Hunger Games. You want Oprah Book Club? Read Cloud Atlas. Better yet, wait for the movie, you'll only waste 2 hours of your life.
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought the trilogy for my kindle.. The book was absolutely amazing. I think people who are not open minded about sex should not read this book but for those of us who are it is a great love story:)
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This production of Jane Eyre is gorgeous.<br /><br />It's also moving.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska is perfect as Jane: reticent, feisty, clear-eyed, young.  You can almost watch her grow and develop as the movie goes along.  And she has one of those faces that is infinitely malleable--plain and withdrawn one moment, electric and beautiful the next, and at all times convincing.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is also terrific.  I had seen him in several things--X Men, Inglourious Basterds, Dangerous Method--and I still couldn't tell if he can act.  This movie proves it.  He is great, ranging from sarcastic and brutal to tender and tormented in a moment.<br /><br />Judi Dench of course is great, even though her role (Mrs. Fairfax) is tiny.<br /><br />And Jamie Bell is just right as the stiff and callow (and domineering) St. John Rivers.<br /><br />But best of all are the settings and the writing.  The settings are gorgeous and breathtaking--particularly the outdoor ones, which are always bathed in misty, endless, shimmering colors.  And the writing!  The writer has had the good sense to stick faithfully to Charlotte Bronte's original, and lift whole passages directly.  This works beautifully.<br /><br />The camera work is lovely, ranging from jittery and hand-held in Jane's moments of torment to swooping and glowing in the indoor scenes to epic and stunning in the outdoor ones.<br /><br />Granted, there is one peculiarity.  Instead of going chronologically, as the book does, this production starts with Jane's horrifying trek across the rain-sodden and barren moors, penniless, friendless, lost, starving, just after leaving Thornfield (Rochester's house).  She nearly dies, and is rescued on the doorstep by St. John Rivers and his two sisters.  Only then are there flashbacks to explain her past--her childhood, her time with Rochester, the catastrophic wedding.<br /><br />This might be confusing for someone unfamiliar with the story, but it makes emotional sense.  It starts at the time of greatest emotional intensity, then goes back to explain.<br /><br />Even those unfamiliar will soon get it.<br /><br />All in all, a splendid production.
1596432594|5.0|Opened the book and didn't look up until book nearly finished.  Wonderful.  It was like being in the background watching Feynman.  Text and illustrations are superb.  Great person captured by exceptional work.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is so fun! It's also rlly simple to use. So addicting. There's nothing bad to say about it rlly. I think that EVERYONE should get this app. Right now. It is so cool. :)
0345529057|5.0|fantastic story .. really keeps your interest .. george martin .. did a fantastic job with this series .. enough said
0374203032|5.0|Whether conducting a college class, giving a television interview, or writing for a general audience, as he does in \\"What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits off Markets,\\" Michael Sandel has the insight and courage to ask the questions each of us should ask our own conscience.<br /><br />Before considering the morality of products and services for sale in this country, Sandel presents a litany of what is now available -- some that will surprise many readers: a prison cell upgrade, the right to immigrate to the US, the right to shoot an endangered black rhino or Artic walrus.<br /><br />He also cites incentive payments for a variety of behaviors: to become a mercenary to fight in Afghanistan, to stand in line overnight for a lobbyist who wants to attend a Congressional hearing, for a second grader to read a book, for an employee to lose weight to qualify for the company health plan, for the right to buy the life insurance policy of an elderly person who needs cash, pay the premiums and collect the benefits. If you scoff at the latter, be aware that companies such as Walmart can claim a corporate interest that allows them to purchase life insurance on employees as varied as sales clerks and janitors -- without their knowledge or consent -- and upon their death collect benefits tax free! Financial institutions are now considering bundling such \\"investments\\" as bonds, as they did with mortgages, and selling these to investors like pension funds or university endowments.<br /><br />For those who question whether it matters if we become a society where everything is for sale and value is determined by the market, Sandel explores two rather obvious reasons -- inequality and corruption. A society where only the affluent or the criminal can compete has serious problems.<br /><br />We all recognize there are things like friendship which money cannot buy -- photos for your Facebook page perhaps, but real friends you can count on, not for sale. Few of us, however, have thought seriously about what happens to altruism when a product or service is given a monetary value. Which provides a more desirable life-saving blood supply -- Great Britain's reliance on voluntary donors or the frequent US practice of paying blood donors such as homeless persons? Sometimes market incentives give surprising results, such as the day care center in Israel frustrated by parents who arrived late to pick up their children. When they imposed a fine for late pickups they were surprised that lateness increased dramatically because parents had lost their sense of moral responsibility and now felt they were paying for a service.<br /><br />Sandel's many examples will leave you fascinated -- and disbelieving. Who knew that there are middlemen who sometimes control gangs of children (shades of Fagan!) to collect autographs from sports heroes which they, in turn, place on the collectable market. Some may criticize Sandel as superficial, but on the contrary, he's wise enough to know that before you can cure apathy you must shock people to attention. This is a deeply thought-provoking book -- one that leaves you wishing you can discuss it with someone else who has read it.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game was fun for a bit. I like that its fast paced and exciting. I deleted because I'm more of a sim gamer, but this game was fun to play on my Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just loved this book. Certainly very different than the other two but everything comes full circle in the end. Most questions are answered and I feel the book ends in a way that gives you satisfaction with the characters and the plot in general. Truly one of the best book series of our time.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|I tried out this game since it looks so cute. It reminds me of Nintendo's Super Mario Bro's. Hard to navigate on Kindle Fire. This game is best suited for those who can use actual controllers (like back in the day). Cute game though.

0439023521|4.0|Part one of the trilogy is actually the best book in the trilogy. AN excellent read with obvious statements about our current society's  emphasis on image & entertainment.<br /><br />It's a shame about part three, Mockingjay, which I gave up on.<br /><br />However this book is good as a stand alone

B007QNRMUU|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Jason Mraz. While this album isn't the Jason Mraz we're used to, it's grown on me and it's a wonderful album.<br /><br />In Jason Mraz's previous album, oftentimes, it sounds like he's babbling out cool words as fast as he can while you remain entertained but baffled at his meaning. He's not as funky here. He's not even a pop star in this album. There aren't catchy duets like 'Lucky'. It is different and the change may be disconcerting to fans. Honestly, I like the change (honestly how much more could we listen to Jason babble nonsensically?)<br /><br />Jason shows his maturity in this album as well as musical breadth. There are signs of influences from country music as well as mellow 70s songs. This is a far more intimate album that Jason's previous work as you're able to peer into the kinds of experience that he may have had in his personal life. Instead of 'cool' Jason we get a much deeper, intimate version of Jason.<br /><br />It's great album. If you're a Jason Mraz fan, just be prepared for a little difference.

0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" gripped me from the first page.  It starts with a transcript of Andy, who is on the witness stand.  He's being questioned about a day a year back when Ben, a 14 year old boy, went missing.  You quickly find out that Andy has a son named Jacob - which gives away that he's got somehow mixed up in Ben's death.  It then goes back to that day that Ben was found.  The rest of the story is told in first person (Andy) about what happened, then flicks forward to more transcripts and back again explaining what the transcript was about until you finally find out why Andy is in the witness stand.<br /><br />I found the thought about \\"the murder gene\\" fascinating.  Is \\"evil\\" something that can be passed down generation to generation and even if you can learn to cope with it, it's always there - deep down.  The book keeps you guessing all the way though - innocent or guilty.<br /><br />The characters were detailed and you ended up feeling with/against/for them.  There are things done when you go wtf? Others when your heart breaks a bit and others when you get angry.<br /><br />I found the book well written, The book was incredibly gripping, it spoon-feeds new information, slowly building a puzzle but keeps enough bits missing leaving the final bit with a gasp.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|1000 Pages of beautifully written adventure. Not much happened plot wise, but I enjoyed the prose and many of the small stories so much that I find it hard to write a bad review about this book.<br /><br />This book was not as good as The Name of the Wind, which seemed a little more focused, but it was still very good. Again the switching between the real world and Kvothe's story telling is great. The scene when he got beaten up by the soldiers was especially great. It is not very often we see supposedly powerful heroes brought down so low.<br /><br />One thing that was a bit odd was the trip to Adem. Kvothe is already great at so many things, does he need to be a ninja too? Some weaknesses would be good. Then again the fact that the innkeeper version of Kvothe is so pathetic makes the contrast even bigger, so perhaps it is a good thing. I actually enjoyed with trip into the Fae, I thought that was really well done, though making Kvothe a sex-god on top of a wizard ninja seems a little much. Still, likely everything else the trip to the Fae was very well written and has some touching moments.<br /><br />Biggest problem with this book is the lack of plot advancement. Even a few more hints into the chandrian would be enough. I suppose Pat is saving everything for book three?
B005HYNCTK|5.0|Is there music right from heaven? If there is, here you have it in a box.<br />I have listened to Celebidache's Bruckner now for over a year and I don't get tired. In the meanwhile I got severely sick and I mainly survived on Bruckner, to be true, not only on Celi's Bruckner, but whenever I needed some solace, Celi's Bruckner delivered.<br />What it is exactly I still don't know: Tempi? Clarity? To be true, tempi are slow, sometimes to the extreme and clarity is a something Bruckner flourishes with very much. But in the end I don't think it is Celibidache alone. Bruckner is credited to have said that in opposition to Brahms, of whom he said that his work was \\"mental construction\\", his, Bruckner's music came from his heart. And so it is!<br />If you listen to the adagio's of the symphonies, especially 3, 7 and 8, but the others do as well, you will sense this quality of tranquility and equanimity  with what is, the quality of accepting life as it comes. Celibidache is one of those rare conductors who, in my opinion, seems to have understood what Bruckner is about. Of course next to him stand others, Haitink, Wand, Jochum, lately Thielemann and others who deliver absolutely almost perfect performances of Brucker's symphonies. Haitink and Wand are quite different, but very beautiful and at a par with Celibidache on the point of orchestral sound. Jochum is more down to earth and Thielemann very structured.  But in the end, for the whole cycle Celebidache's Bruckner stands out for me as the epitome the art of Bruckner who while being alive somehow had tasted heaven and was able to transmit some its qualities.<br />If you ever suffer from metaphysical homesickness try this as a cure.<br /><br />Jan Willem van Ee<br />Netherlands

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a love story, the sex parts of it are just secondary to me. If you want to feel giddy, and fall in love again then this book is for you. Do not be discouraged about the BDSM in the book, because they're not hard core as you think, because I personally do not enjoy reading those kind of stories, they're too much for me. Let's just say this book is like an eye opening, that kind of lifestyle do exist.<br /><br />You have to be open minded to enjoy this book, otherwise it's not for you. This specific book 1 is my favorite because of the courtship, just perfect to begin their love story.<br /><br />If you are planning to read this book, make sure that you have the second one - Fifty Shades Darker before it ends because you do not want to be left hanging. I recommend this book who loves virgin heroine, a well-experienced, hot & dominant hero & an erotic love story.

B0086DBE62|1.0|Mirror Mirror is not a good rendition of Snow White. I say this not because it reverses or alters portions of the characters or plot, which it assuredly and poorly does, but because it does not tell a story, really, nor is it really a film. It is a collection of barely acceptable motion picture moments edited together with the hopes that what it adds up to is a smart, cute bit of entertainment. It is, sadly, neither smart, nor cute, nor loveable on the whole, though it has moments of likeability. As a matter of fact, the best part of the film is the end. I say this not because the film is over (though that is a bonus, excepting that dreadful feeling that you want a portion of your life back) but because the totally out of nowhere Bollywood-esque dance number is the icing on the weirdly constructed cake. It is the only charming thing about this boredom inducing heap of edited scenes.<br /><br />As for characters, I will start with the ok and work my way into the basement. The heroine (Snow White) is somewhat likeable, but there really isn't a reason or motivation for why she does what she does. She is two dimensional: by turns innocent, pretty and idealistic or roguish, courageous and crafty. These two dimensions are sandwiched together without any development of how they fit within the same person. I felt a bit like I was getting into an argument with a person, in this case the director, who thinks that merely asserting the same thing over and over again will win the day. This tactic may be effective on many, but in the end no one feels good about the result.<br /><br />The Prince character has no redeeming qualities. He is supposed to be the comic relief in a girl-power film. His bumbling and shirtlessness could have been cute or funny. Instead, it's just sort of, well, there.<br /><br />The Witch is just simply dreadful. Julia Roberts simply cannot save this trite, vapid, monochromatic character. I didn't care if she was gotten rid of or what she was doing to herkingdom because she was simply too much of a caricature. There was nothing familiar about her evil that anyone, even a child, could hang their hat on. Nothing shocking, frightening or even identifiably evil on a human scale. The mirror scenes were inexplicable and became the cornerstone moments for my fascination at the lack of artistic vision in this film. (More on this later)<br /><br />The dumbest characters were the dwarves, played by real, live dwarves and midgets. They are supposedly converted from being outsiders and thieves to goodness loving cads by the end. They simply annoy throughout, and, given the fact that Snow White is supposed to be the leader who enacts their conversion, the change is totally unwarranted. The short jokes are not funny. Their \\"good-heartedness deep down\\" isn't really convincing. They made me wish I had taken my wife to see the Avengers in the same theater instead, even though she hates comic book films.<br /><br />Finally, there are all the artistic licenses throughout the film to create its atmosphere. The locations throughout, from the palace to the forest to the hut in the middle of a mysterious lake where the mirror is, are surreal. They are supposed to be surreal, I get it. But one is left asking why the choices were made for each. The only conclusion I could come to is that some wonkish art major thought a particular concept would look cool and didn't bother to have a vision of how the entire fictional world fit together. Dali paintings are amazing and surreal. This film is not a Dali painting though. It is components of 4 to 6 Dali paintings in a collage held together by dried nacho cheese.  It looks grotesque in the \\"no-talent-hack\\" sort of way and, more importantly, leaves a horrid taste in one's mouth.<br /><br />It was once argued that 100 monkeys on typewriters would eventually turn out at least one play of Shakespeare's, merely by accident. Chance and mere operative intelligence is all that is really needed to get a good outcome. Sadly, this theory was tested with real monkeys once. After a week they hadn't even typed a word in any language. Not even a one letter word. The conclusion of course is that you need real intelligence and real creativity in order to even string sentences together on a page; a human mind can perform such things but an untrained monkey cannot. A very highly trained human mind produces Shakespeare's plays. Given the choice between this film or one edited by those same monkeys, I'll take the monkey film. While it would have less order, it would be more entertaining and thought provoking. It would invite a vision onto a blank canvas. Mirror, Mirror is a filled-in canvas painted with the hands of too many painters, all its ideas crashing into each other causing pain and misery for the viewer. Therefore, give me the monkeys.

B007L6VR6M|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is the magical seventh film by Wes Anderson. It's undeniable that Anderson has carved a niche for himself, making highly evocative films that treat each frame as a canvas and tell the story with a perfect amount of wry humor and minimalism, but I've always had a love/hate relationship with his films. While I always admire his style and the unique vision he brings to every project, out of his previous six films I've loved only three. His skill as a director aside, he's a terrific writer with a great feel for character, a dry sense of humor, and a great penchant for subtlety. My gripes with him only arise when his style completely overrides substance and his film becomes a stylistic exercise in monotony. Thankfully, this is not the case with Moonrise Kingdom, the best film I've seen this year. It's too soon to say (and his greatest admirers may call it heresy), but this may be my favorite Wes Anderson film.<br /><br />The film takes place in 1965 on an idyllic island called New Penzance. The story centers around two young children, Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, making their film debuts). Sam is an orphan attending a Khaki Scout summer camp on the island led by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). Suzy is staying on the island with her dysfunctional parents Walt and Laura Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her three young brothers. Both are troubled, awkward social outcasts who met the previous summer and remained pen pals, ultimately agreeing to run away together on the island. This prompts a search posse for the two, led by Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). As is characteristic of Anderson's work, the adults in the story are just as dyspeptic as the children, if not more so.<br /><br />For me, Moonrise Kingdom is the summation of the cinematic techniques, stylistic vision, and depth of character that Anderson has honed in his previous films. He doesn't depart far from his formula in Moonrise Kingdom, but he puts all of his strengths on display and produces an adroit work of art that resonates on an emotional and visual level. With a directorial style that's so infused into the DNA of his films you can often identify his work by a single frame. He keeps his work from growing repetitious by expanding on and refining his talents; as a result, this may be his most beautiful film. A cynosure due to his impeccable use of a color palette that is rustic, vivid, and nostalgic, but never garish. He's worked with cinematographer Robert Yeoman since his debut Bottle Rocket and Yeoman's camera work has never more clearly had such a confident grasp on Anderson's visual aesthetic. Every frame looks like a great photograph. It's not only beautiful but atmospheric, particularly in the way it evokes the chimerical 1960s that exists in Anderson's head. Anderson is a master of style and setting, but is even more masterfully adept at using music to complement mood, style, and setting. Both the original compositions and time-specific music are essential to the spell this film casts.<br /><br />I've never questioned Anderson's ability to create a beautiful cinematic canvas, but what elevates Moonrise Kingdom is the script he co-wrote with Roman Coppola. It has the substance and the beauty necessary to validate the style. With style and substance working together in perfect harmony, he weaves a fairy tale tapestry of magical realism and whimsy that's effortlessly charming and likable. It helps that he never seems preoccupied with things going on outside the realm of his own creations. There's never the impression that anyone else on the island exists except for those directly involved in the mechanics of the plot. Keeping the focus solely on these characters gives them very distinct personalities and attributes. His characters are often quirky, reserved, and poetic, but they never feel rehashed from previous creations. What makes Moonrise Kingdom so heartfelt and poignant is that it's essentially alove story between two pre-teen children and it takes these characters seriously. By treating them with respect rather than as a foil, he captures the innocence and purity of young love in a way that's rarely captured so effectively and beautifully. I imagine he admires the lack of pretense that exists in these children, especially in relation to the story's dysfunctional adults that go through similar trials and reveal themselves as the more naïve personalities.<br /><br />Anderson never falters on casting wrong and he pulls frequently from a troupe of actors well-versed in the rhythm of his films. There are familiar faces here; Jason Schwartzman, and of course Bill Murray, both of whom seem perfectly at home here. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances in years; a succinct, quiet role that reminds us of his ability to go beyond \\"action star\\" when given the right material. Norton takes to Anderson's world natural, giving a quirky, alacritous performance as the timid Scout Master. Moonrise Kingdom is very funny, but in the most subtle way, never pining for laughs or acknowledging that something a character has said was supposed to be funny. Anderson really pulls great work from the two newcomers, Gilman and Hayward. They're both the same age as the characters they play and they bring that naïve, yet perceptive quality that Hollywood films so often fail to capture by casting grown men and women as young people. The entire cast does great work and fit this grand puzzle perfectly.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom is an astonishing accomplishment that envelops you in its warm symmetry and entrances you in its spell. It's a light, funny, and feel-good film that I can't imagine viewers being able to easily disregard. In the coming months, it'll certainly remain one of the year's best films. It panders to the visual and auditory senses, but plays just as strongly on emotional and thoughtful level. Wes Anderson has really outdone himself as a filmmaker and his latesteffort is a work of undeniable beauty and artistry.
B000JMLDCS|5.0|The bottom line of this piece is a balm to the soul for those on a journey to find God.  If you have the world all figured out, or believe that the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson Particle means that all of our questions will finally be answered, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />If, however, you get a tingling sensation when you hear about something amazing and unexplainable, if you are willing to listen to the voice in your own heart while you read the story on the page, then you will enjoy Chesterton like a squirrel enjoys an acorn; devouring parts of it immediately, while savings others for a time in your immediate future when you'll need them.<br /><br />Highly recommended for recovering philistines like me.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Uneven character development, but decent acting.  I enjoyed the movie a lot more than I expected and it was easy to get into.

Yesterday, 4 days after my phone was lost, I got a call and it was our friend saying that they had found my phone while swimming in the ocean. They had run inside, charged it, and tried to see if it was working. It was! My iphone is working perfectly after spending days on the ocean floor. I highly recommend this case to everyone!

B001NESPHC|2.0|I've been listening to a lot of female vocalists recently.  Old stuff like Anita O'Day, Helen Merrill, Billie Holiday, Rosemary Clooney and Julie London as well as newer stuff from a range of the highly rated female jazz and pop vocalists performing today.  I discovered something interesting.  Upon first hearing the initial recordings of many of these highly acclaimed newer singers, I am impressed.  But on subsequent listenings, the music leaves me wondering what I saw in it to begin with.  Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux and, now, Melody Gardot.  All from the same mold and all making me question my positive first impressions of each of them.  The bottom line being, their music bores me to death on repeated listening.<br /><br />Case in point:  this recording.  Ms Gardot's first recording I found to be enjoyable enough for me to order her second album from Amazon soon after buying the first.  Before \\"My One & Only Thrill\\" ever arrived, I had gotten a little bored with \\"Worrisome Heart\\".  Sure, her voice is nice.  She can sing in tune and hold a note, unlike some well regarded vocalists.  The lyrics to many of her songs are pretty darn good--much better than the music, in my opinion.  But there's not much variety involved.  Mostly it's poems set to music rather than songs with cohesive and complementary  lyrics and music.  Always a little on the slow side.  On \\"My One & Only Thrill\\", even the liveliest song is so close to death it needs to have been put on life support.  The slow, dragging pace of this recording wore me down before I finished listening to it.  Okay,  I admit it--I never finished listening.  I jumped through the last few songs until I came to \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\".  At that point, I shut it off.  Jeez, that's the worst rendition of that song in memory.  A totally emotionless presentation, performed in the same painfully slow pace of the previous pieces.<br /><br />I can't say this is a bad recording.  It's just boring.  Like the other mentioned singers and their recordings, there's not enough substance here to maintain interest on repeated listening.  Well, I still listen to Madeleine Peyroux's first recording once in a while but I haven't liked anything else she's done since.<br /><br />But some people like this type of banality in music.  To paraphrase a quotation, it's the type of music people who like that type of music would like.singers and their recordings, there's not enough substance here to maintain interest on repeated listening.

B00846REIS|3.0|I think I would have liked this book better if it had been a longer time after finishing The Fifty Shades books.I kept comparing the books.It seemed there were so many events in Fify Shades that were in this book with only minor changes.I could not stop reading the other series before I finished it ,this I read  off and on. I did not think it was as good a book  .I am going to read the next book to see how things end beween them I hope this will be the last in the series have no interest in reading another. I really would believe she was copying Fifty Shades if she did a third book. She is a better writer than that.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've NEVER been a fan of any author.  I've liked certain books here and there, but never have I said that I was a fan of such-and-such writer.  That has changed.  I'm excited to have someone I can say is my favorite author.  I AM a Hugh Howey fan, he is my FAVORITE author.  (I'm a 30+ woman, married and with a young family, that has a groupie-type admiration for Hugh Howey.)<br /><br />Many people have already given great reviews about the \\"Wool\\" series and I concur with all those 5 star reviews.  The way Mr. Howey writes is captivating.  The very first line in the first \\"Wool\\" book - was shocking, I was drawn to HAVING to read the book, feeling deeply concerned for the character.<br />I was talked into reading Hunger Games...liked it somewhat...but found myself wanting to explore similar futuristic stories that were more mature.  I was thrilled to find Hugh Howey!<br />Damn my eyes and my need for SLEEP.  I wanted \\"Wool\\" to go on forever - I wanted to stay awake forever.  Naturally, the next best realistic thing I could do was to buy the entire series, kept me busy for 2 weeks...bought the 6th book...it's keeping me busy right now.<br />I think my favorite part of Mr. Howey's writing is that he helps you connect with the characters so deeply that they move you, inspire you, thrill you, disappoint you...and revitalize those first feelings all over again.  It's an emotional ride as well as a great sci-fi story about a post-apocalyptic world that is struggling to survive.  I LOVE IT, Mr. HOWEY.  I want you to get a movie deal - I NEED you to get a movie deal!  I'm excited to do my part to help get the word out about you and all of your works.  I can't wait to start on your other books.  You are AWESOME!<br />When my husband reads this series, I'm sure he'll have a more technical approach when he writes his own review.  As for me, all I can say is how emotionally vested I became in wanting this world to survive.  I connected with your writing style and I love the characters you created.  They're witty, they're lovable, they're detestable, they're people I know in my own personal life that I can inject into the story.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a review for &quot;V For Vendetta - Two-Disc Special Edition&quot;, to give some information on the extras included with the movie.<br /><br />This is one of my family's favorite movies. It's exciting and it's stirring. Comic book but complex. Superbly filmed and acted, but then it had an amazing graphic novel to follow. Here's comments from participants in the DVD extras on this 2-disc Special Edition that echo my feelings about &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;:<br /><br />Kevin Phipps, supervising art director: &quot;You don't really know where you are, in terms of time. It's almost as if creativity has stopped.&quot; (extra #1)<br /><br />Daniel McTeigue, director: &quot;I think it's a political thriller, first and foremost. It is in the superhero genre, but it's also a play on that convention.&quot; (Special Feature)<br /><br />John Hurt, who plays Adam Sutler: &quot;The themes are serious. I'm not sure the treatment is as serious as that. But on the other hand, if it was as serious as that, I'm not sure that it would reach the amount of people that it's intended to reach.&quot; (Special Feature)<br /><br />Stephen Fry, who plays Dietrich: &quot;This is a movie about a terrorist. The hero is a terrorist. It's a very good ethical point, because as we all know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.&quot; (Special Feature)<br /><br />Indeed, though I root for &quot;V&quot;, he is not perfect. He wants the populace to stir themselves, stand up for themselves, and take their government back. But not until after he's had his vengeance.<br /><br />DISC NUMBER ONE:<br />1.  The movie. Spoken languages available are the original English and dubbed French.  Subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.<br />2.  Special Feature, 31 minutes: &quot;Freedom Forever! Making V for Vendetta&quot;. This feature and extras 1, 2, and 3 were made at the same time. That is, when someone, such as the director, appears in more than one, you can tell that they were filmed at the same time. The extras compliment each other, rather than repeat each other. Interspersed with the interviews are film clips and production clips, too.<br />Participants include James McTeigue, director, who says, &quot;I was the assistant director on the Matrix films. To live in the Matrix world is to know the graphic novel world.&quot;<br /><br />DISC NUMBER TWO EXTRAS:<br />1.  &quot;Designing the Near Future&quot;, 9 minutes. Interesting stuff. The V mask was cast in fiberglass from a clay mold. It took the sculptor several tries. Most of the film was made at the Babelsberg Studio in Berlin. But there were crucial outdoor scenes that had to be filmed in England, such as at the end, where the mass of V's converge on Trafalgar Square on the 5th of November. It took 5 months to set up the 3 nights of filming; about 30 agencies/organizations had to give approval and/or co-ordinate.<br />2.  &quot;Remember Remember: Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot&quot;, 14 minutes. The history of the original gunpowder plot and how it's grown into an annual celebration in England. One interesting comment is by Sinead Cusack, who plays Delia Surridge. She was born in Dalkey, Ireland, and they have a different view of Guy Fawkes there.<br />3.  &quot;England Prevails: V for Vendetta and The New Wave in Comics&quot;, 24 minutes. This is about the comic book, or graphic novel. The camera-shy Alan Moore does not appear, but David Lloyd, who created the graphics for Moore's narrative, appears in several of the extras.<br />Karen Berger, executive editor of Vertigo, DC's edgier more adult-oriented company says: &quot;V for Vendetta is in a class of its own. It's a brilliant piece of work. It's a commentary on society. At the time it was written, there was absolutely nothing being done like that.&quot;<br />The original comic book was published in black &amp; white in England. Twenty-six issues were created before the publisher folded. Unfortunately, this was before V's story was finished!  Both Alan Moore and David Lloyd were subsequently hired by DC comics, who saw the genius, and published a complete version of &quot;V&quot; in color.<br />4.  Cat Power Montage. This is like a song video. Clips of the movie are shown while Cat Powers sings &quot;I Found a Reason&quot;, from The Covers Album (2000)<br />5.  Soundtrack album info<br />6.  Theatrical trailer<br /><br />Happy Readerory was finished!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for passing time and helps keep the little ones busy when I'm busy too. too many adds in game.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|bought this product, for a new computer i am building, just got it yesterday so have not had a chance to test it but everything looks right for what i ordered.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I purchased this because of the extras, including the digital copy.<br /><br />I always loved this movie.  It's been years since I've viewed it.  It looks great on blu-ray.  I have to admit though, the dialogue is a little \\"hokier\\" than I recalled.  That being said, it holds up very well.  The action sequences are still top notch.  What a tragedy about Brandon Lee... No doubt greater things were ahead of him.<br /><br />The extras are fantastic.  I enjoyed the extended and deleted scenes in particular, in part because I enjoyed seeing just a few extra minutes of Brandon Lee on the screen.  Also, one screen finally shows how Brandon (as the Crow) gets his arms injured subsequent to rescuing the Darla character.  It still doesn't explain why his arms didn't heal, but at least it shows the reason he has to wrap his arms in duct tape.  If you're interested in why his arms didn't heal, just ask in the comments section and I'll tell ya.<br /><br />Great film.  Still miss ya Brandon!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Love these headphones. The price is right and the sound quality is very good. I never did care much for earbuds , to me they are uncomfortable after a few minutes. When i wear these, i feel like i am in my own space, and loving it. Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|First off, let me say that this is a suspense thriller. It's not a psycho killer chiller with lots of blood, torture and gore. That's what I liked about it! This was more a mental exercise than a read where you have to close your eyes against the details that make you gag or cringe.<br /><br />In other words, the author develops her characters, has an unusual plot, and uses alternating points of view (she said/he said) to tell the story. I enjoyed it and recommend it to all fans of a good mystery with a question -- just who is the sociopath here?<br /><br />Nick arrives home one afternoon to find his living room a mess with signs of a struggle and his wife, Amy, GONE. The unfolding of the story, the revelations, the twists and turns will keep you turning the pages! Enjoy.
0345803507|2.0|Perhaps it was a mistake reading all three Fifty Shades books within the same month; maybe I would have enjoyed it more otherwise.  I read the second right after the first, and that highlighted how repetitive the author's descriptions were in the second.  To take a break and hope that it was reading back to back that made it seem the second was just the first book with a slightly different plot, I read 5 books before reading this book.  Nope, that didn't help.  This book has very little plot, and resorts to a villain that has no real menace (SPOILER:.................  he's incarcerated during most of the book.  END SPOILER................),  repetitive sex, and of course (SPOILER)...................,  the happy ever after for every romance novel that ever was - a baby to tie everything together and make for the perfect ending.  (END SPOILER) .......... Barf.<br /><br />As the title of my review says, this book wasn't really an enjoyable read, as it was a rehash of the first book, but with a lot less plot.  Don't bother reading unless you're on vacation and need something to read at the beach that you won't mind getting sandy or drooling on while napping.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a great game! I hate it when people complain about the ads all you have to do is press continue!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|First, let me state what isn't obvious, I'm 53 years old and have a brain injury (wife helped me with spelling).<br /><br />My concentration and problem solving abilities are very limited. Long term memory is intact, but often short term memory can be questionable. There are other problems, but for review of this game the items mentioned are sufficient.<br /><br />When I first started playing the game I thought, how hard can it be? OMG, can this be any more difficult or challenging? I was often frustrated beyond anything. How can some of these puzzles be accomplished in the specified number of moves? Yet, for some reason I persisted. It took me almost six (6) months of hard work and I finally got to the second level.<br /><br />The second level took only five (5) months to complete. Mind you I don't play the game each and every day, I can't. I tried that once for two days, playing maybe 20 minutes every couple of hours, my brain could not take it. During the second day my wife came home and found me sound asleep on the couch with the phone held in my hand, gently leaning towards my chest. That day a rule was established, I could play the game but only twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon, each time for only 20 minutes, period.<br />Even with the set time limitations, I cannot thank the developer enough for putting this game together. Although it's been a challenge in playing, my confidence has grown as has my self esteem. GREAT GAME!!!<br /><br />Latest news, my wife has said I can purchase the full version.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like this game,  reminds me of super Mario! takes me back to when I was a kid:) it's a fun game people will enjoy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app I have ever downloaded. I Highly recommend this for anyone seeking a closer relationship with God. Very easy to navigate and extremely handy.
B007MHVVCU|5.0|Ok this book was really great. For all those people who think its âevilâ it is just a book that is purely fictional. AH wrote a real thriller thats fast paced and full of suspense. I truly recommend it if you are a fan of Stephen King or Harry Potter or any kind of paranormal type activity books. :)
B003FTXHCQ|3.0|The people trapped inside of building having to escape by figuring out puzzles has become overdone. Frankly I am a bit burned out by it all, I stopped watching Saw movies at IV because it got so bad and so far from the original, although not as bad as Halloween 3, which had nothing to do with the first two movies other than the fact it was Halloween.<br /><br />What is different about this movie which made it tolerable to watch was that it concentrated on the technicians who were operating the cube rather than the blood and guts aspect of people getting killed in imaginative fashion, although it does have some of that.<br /><br />The bad guy with the fake eye was almost cartoonish. If you sat through the other two movies and liked them, you know you are going to watch this one anyway, so why are you reading the reviews?<br /><br />No sex or nudity.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is great if you want to play a quick game or need some time waster. however to advance deep into the game, you will need to put a lot of time into it
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I had trouble believing Lincoln's mom (Robin McLeavy) was killed by a vampire when I am pretty sure it was a zombie infestation. Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) vows revenge and is taken under the tutoring of Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a backwoods Van Helsing. In spite of the vampire's brute strength, our rail splitter is able to keep pace. These are not real vampires, but those new Hollywood \\"Twilight\\" vampires that can go out into the sunlight.<br /><br />The events of Lincoln's life is at times out of sequence and incorrect. They put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film saying history isn't always recorded correctly. That is all fine and well, but they should have made it a little closer to demonstrate the writer took some time to do some research. As a vampire film, this has a few good special effects, but nothing we haven't seen before. There are plenty of vampire films out there I thought were vastly superior to this one. The unique aspect of this film is the addition of Lincoln which frankly wasn't integrated into the film that well from an historical point of view. I thought Asylum (Lincoln vs Zombies)did a better job at integrating history. They spent a lot of money for special effects and a substandard script. Sadly, this has been become the blockbuster norm this summer. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: Infrequent f-bomb, brief sex scene,
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This album is why God Made The Beach Boys. Every time that I listen to it, it just becomes more and more comfortable....like a new pair of shoes. This is a miracle at their age and when I went out and saw them in concert, I came back with even more respect and thankful that they may do yet another cd. This one is mellow with just enough beat to make you want to dance. Even my 13 year old is singing the tunes around the house!
B003YKYX7O|3.0|Not as sexy as \\"Species\\". In fact I really didn't find the hairless human hybrid, even when naked, sexy at all. A couple splices genes and creates a new species of globs they call Fred and Ginger. The globs are created to produce proteins etc. to enhance animal livestock. The inventive couple discovers they could splice human DNA and create a new species in order to cure human genetic diseases. The corporation forbids them from such an experiment so they go underground to do it. The woman, Elsa (Sarah Polly, slightly mentally unstable) uses her own DNA to create a creature which in the interest of time develops very rapidly. The infant looks like something out of Lynch's \\"Eraserhead\\". Eventually they have to move the human hybrid to a farm where it is cared for by Elsa and her boyfriend Clive (Adrian Brody).<br /><br />The movie is intellectually interesting, but at the same time has poor characters. I thought I was going to adore this movie from reading the box, but alas, I did not as the stupidity of the characters got in the way.<br /><br />The F-bomb is dropped a few times. Human hybrid nudity and sex including one rape.<br /><br />Worth a view, if you keep your expectations low.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app is pretty fast and easy to control. I just wish I could figure out the sound settings. It works well over my wireless network, but I cannot get it to connect over the internet because I'm l lazy and forwarding ports on my router is a pain.
B005DJ7AX8|5.0|I was sitting on the edge of my seat during the whole movie as the plot got thicker and thicker. Adam Lange (Brosnan) is a former British Prime Minister who hires Ewan McGregor to finish ghost writing his memoirs. As the movie opens we see the first ghost writer's body wash up on the beach. Ewan is selected because he is politically stupid. After his initial meeting with a hiring group,(Jim Belushi) he is handed a manuscript to look at. On his way home, he is mugged and the manuscript stolen. He suspects it is because the robbers thought it was Adam Lange's memoirs.<br /><br />On his way to meet Lange, he sees on TV that Lange is being charged with war crimes for turning over suspected terrorists to the CIA for torture (Apparently only the US and Israel are allowed to do that under the UN charter). He finally meets Lange and his aides and wife (Ruth), only find out Ruth (Olivia Williams) dislikes Lange's aide (Kim Cattrall) and suspects they are having an affair. McGregor shifts gears from Ghostwriter to investigative journalist as he unravels a web of deceit and lies.<br /><br />The movie is long, but it held my interest all the way through.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm not even a video gamer (age 31/ female) and i am addicted to this game. Most definitely my favorite app so far.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|excellent reçu en quelques jours depuis les états unis attention bluray zone 2 obligatoire pour la lecture les lecteurs blu ray Francais  ne le prennent pas en charge
B0070NSPCU|5.0|most entertaining book i have read since i finished the song of ice and fire series. the author has actually surpassed martin though imo due to no character switching regarding the narrative. truly worthy of 5 stars. i wish the second was out
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good set of games to pass time with which is why I downloaded it in the first place.... I don't notice the banner ads on the bottom ....the other ads/offers for points can be annoying but are part of the game so I  tolerate them.
0345803485|5.0|these books are very good i have loved reading this one its was very addicting, every one including men shoud read this book
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! I had not heard of it until last month when a friend of mine recommended it to me, and I can now see why it is a classic :-) Very nice prose that made me feel immersed in the period without getting too detailed. Great flow and must thank the translators who worked to make this come alive so nicely in English. 5 stars!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the best games I ever had. I toatly recamended for any age kid. But it gets boring once you unlocks every thing. any other way it fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. must have. no exceptions. download now so you can begin to have the most fun that you can
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is a brilliant. With fantastic storytelling, great characters, and enjoyable gameplay, this game will not dissapoint. The games graphics may not be amazing, but everything else makes it great enough of a game to enjoy. an not wait for the sequel to be released this October.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Just got my cd a few days ago.  I cannot believe how great this album is.  These guys sound like they stepped out of 1982 and did this album.  I love it!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|did you know that theres the same thing but its free so pepole don't get this app because its the same thing people same exact thing your wasting your time and money
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have been using the premium version for a couple of years.  In fact I would recommend buying both Xmarks and LastPass.  Two superb programs.  I have never had a probem with either.  For a password manager, it can't be beat and is secure.  Xmarks allows for you to sync your favorite bookmarks on multiple computers.  If you pc crashes, you are safe.  Just download your bookmarks.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|I Love Coldplay but this CD is absolutely hirabel.  For the record my 2001 v70 Volvo radio works perfectly for re-writen cds but this offical cd is recorded very low so you have to turn it up all the way to hear it!!!!!!  Awesome songs but when you can hardly hear it you cant enjoy it
0345522478|3.0|I was looking for a new book series and thought this was interesting, with the positive reviews it received I gave it a try. The story overall is well done, the setting and concept is all good. My only problem with this series (read the first two as of this writing) is the corny humor and the author's need to remind us we are in modern times. At first I was like okay, he is just setting up the atmosphere and letting us know this modern day by making references to modern day music and movies, cool. Then it seemed like every other paragraph and even during fights he would do it, to the point of being annoying. The dog really annoys me, reminds me of Scooby Doo with a dirty mouth but very corny humor. It just all seems very forced and overdone at times. I was looking for something a little darker and serious, I enjoy some snippets of humor but this book could be a fantasy/comedy at times. Just not what I am into. Nitpicking now, but I also get annoyed that the author must be from the area where the book is written because he always seems like he needs to give you directions and an idea of what street he is on. This may create immersion for folks from that area but to me it is just pointless.<br /><br />In summary, good story and concept just way too cheesy at times for my taste. If you're looking for a serious fantasy book this may not be for you.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I hear what some of the reviewers are saying ... seems kind of muddy ... and maybe the chorus parts are sung one too many times during the song.... I HATED this recording when I first heard it and was reading along with the lyrics ..... then about after the 3rd listen I said ..... Holy cow this is an amazing record ... and I've played it every day since june 14th now..... Cant wait to hear it live in Pittsburgh .... Amazing..... My favorite Rush record since GUP.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is so cool I love it it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun
B00416D7A4|5.0|These are simply awesome. The only downside was the price that they carry with them. I am 6 ft, 145 lbs and the smalls fit prefect.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I am a die-hard Coldplay fan. I have listened to this album over and over and enjoy every song. It is very different compared to other albums,but I find that Coldplay is a band that evolves constantly. It is an album that gets your emotions going. I have seen them in concert and would love to see this one performed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was impressed on the amount and variety of reading plans. I found exactly what I was looking for to read the Bible on 1 year. Also it is easy to use and so helpful!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|One star because I did not have the option of zero star. I cannot believe I spent money for this one. I am a very patient reader and have eclectic taste. I can use the finger of one hand to count how many books I was not able to finish in my life. This book is one of them.<br />I am not particularly offended by the sex content, but I could not get passed the first few chapters of the first book for two main reasons. The first one, it is awfully written. The second one, I found the plot uninteresting. Maybe if I had kept reading it, the story would have picked up somehow. But the terrible writing prevented me from going on.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am almost embarrassed to admit that I actually read this book from start to finish.  I find it hard to believe that it has sold as many copies as it has, however, I fell into the trap too.  I had just finished reading a wonderful historical fiction (Kitchen House) when I picked this book up.  Oh what a difference in writers, one exceptional, one who I honestly felt was awful!  I suffered through the first Grey and requested a refund on books 2 and 3 which Amazon gave me without question. If you are an avid reader, you will be very disappointed.  If you don't read much and like trash, you will probably like it.  Kitchen House is a lot better use of reading time!
B00846REIS|4.0|Review from SlicedOpenReviews(dot)com<br /><br />Writing this review is going to be slightly difficult for me, for a number of reasons, mainly being my love of the alpha male character instantly makes me fall in love with the book. Right, wrong or indifferent it totally skews my POV and feelings. Though, there were a number of things that totally drove me crazy. To satisfy my need for happy endings, we will start with the bad.<br /><br />Gideon Cross = creeper, straight creeper, if I were to have the encounter with someone the way that Eva did with Gideon, I'd call security, quick, fast and in a hurry, have his a$$ detained and incarcerated for an indefinite period of time, period end of story. Personally, I totally dig the power male thing, but WOW, he took a flying leap off the crazy mountain and enjoyed it. While as the book goes on he becomes less \\"stalker freak\\" and more \\"damaged goods\\" I never swooned for him, first impression totally killed it for me so I could never get into him. But, Eva on the other hand, well we will get into her during the \\"good\\" portion, in fact let's go. Eva, she was believable, sophisticated, and strong and I'm pretty sure that I fell more in love with her than I did with Gideon. It is really good to see a strong woman play counterpart to the alpha male! The overall story line to BARED TO YOU was also a definite plus. After the first one-on-one encounter with Gideon I really did almost pass this to my DNF pile, but something kept be going and I'm glad I stuck it out until the end.<br /><br />Overall, well I'm going to tread very lightly down the \\"Fifty\\" river. While I have not reviewed any of the Fifty books at this point (I read them prior to my blog starting) I did enjoy them, based on entertainment alone. There was so much wrong with \\"Fifty\\" that you have no choice but to enjoy them. To further see my point on this you have to check out follow blogger April over at Sim-Sational Books, she hits the nail on the head during her Sexy Summer Saturdays review of Fifty and you will see what I'm talking about! Ok sorry, went on a slight tangent, but Fifty = good for entertainment, BARED = good for story, so, take you pick, both were overall good reads, just similar character set.<br /><br />Giving BARED TO YOU a general rating has been most difficult, why? Well...<br />Did I like this book? Heck yes!<br />Was this book hot? Heck yes!<br />But, I'm trying to be a bit more selective on the elusive 5 star rating, and, well there was just something that didn't exactly make it over that edge for me.ummer Saturdays review of Fifty and you will see what I'm talking about!

0553386794|4.0|The mistakes on the Kindle version, cited in earlier reviews, have been fixed. I was dithering on this purchase because I'm not into fantasy and only got into Games from the HBO series, so I already knew the plotline for this volume. The book is worth reading because it flushes out the characters and families and dynastic relationships more, and characters I do not care about (Jon Snow) or actively dislike from the TV show (i'm not even going to look up the spelling for...Dany) are more relatable and human-like, esp. Jon Snow, who comes off as a heroic lead. I still cannot get past some of the dialogue from Dany and her Khan (\\"my sun and moon, star of my loins, etc\\"), but cannot tell if it would have been okay in the context of the novel if I had not heard the actress' stilted delivery first. Knowing what happens definitely takes away from the read, and I have heard people say that of the show if they have already read the books. Plot is a big part of the read if you are not a diehard fan. I think you have to choose one--either the show or the book for your best first encounter. I'm not sure if I'm going to continue with the 2nd volume as I know what happens, but it is a good summer read. I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm so impressed with the totality of the world Martin has created. It's probably what I would give the novel if I hadn't already known what happens. 3 stars if you've seen the TV show and are not obsessed with family crests.
B0036QN98K|5.0|Still Alice was such a great book. My grandmother is going thru dementia right now do I thought it would help me understand... It sure did I have passed it on to other family members to read and ordered her next book Left Neglected can't wait to start it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just know it is a page-turner and the characters are intense. It's best to go in blind, I think, to ramp up the suspense. That said, this isn't just a whodunit novel unless you extend that definition to \\"who wronged you last\\" --meaning, this is also a book about domestic grievance and fallen expectations. It's cagey and actually quite a bit funny. It's a testimony to the writing that my varying levels of empathy for the characters were never completely extinguished.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Heard about this book from a friend.  Went to Amazon and read some reviews, then read the look inside and kept the $10.  Heard from another friend and another friend and another stranger at the book store and finally decided to buy the book.  First half went okay....loved the emails, felt she was oddly/manically confused. He was great, but too good to be believable.  The end was so abrupt I at first thought something was wrong with my Kindle.  I believed his perception of the D/s relationship, but never \\"felt\\" her extreme reaction at the end.  And yes, the writing was redundant, trite and  juvinile....i mean jeez!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty fun... it keeps you busy and gets addicting... perfect way to kill time. I would recommend this app to anyone with any amount of free time on their hands.
B005KELQEU|1.0|Bought this for my Wife for Christmas along with the Kindle Touch. The Touch just barley fit inside and after closing it 2 or 3 times the zipper broke. Should have returned it right away, but procrastonated, and by the time I looked in to it, it was too late. Just wanted to warn any Kindle Touch users, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS COVER. Usually Belkin is good Quality, but this is cheaply made.

This cd has me wanting more of this talented and insightful artist. The music is very good and the sound is clear and crisp. Looking to purchase another.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I didn't love the books.  I wanted to, but I just didn't get this wonderful and great love story.  All I got was pointless sex scenes.  And a lot of them sucked, and they were repetitious.  I thought Ana was too weak.  She just let him rule over her too much, and if she was ok with it then fine, but I got the impression that she didn't like it.  I didn't like the whole leah/jack drama, it was so stupid, maybe it was the way it was written.  I just didn't love these books.  Should have stopped at the first one. I have this thing-just have to finish what I start. In this case I shouldn't have.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This Book is for readers with an open<br />Mind!! Once you get pass the erotic nature of their relationship it becomes a very interesting book!!! Love Love Love it!!!
B001GMH8RO|5.0|Love this movie and the Blu-Ray makes it even better.  Sharper picture and colors.  Anyone who is a die hard Patrick Swayze fan will love this one for their collection.
030758836X|2.0|Took a while to get into this story since it was very dull at first.  Once it did pick up it went much faster, especially wanting to know how it would all come together in the end.  Unfortunately, the ending was so awful and it made no sense at all.  No one I know would ever do what these two did in the end.<br /><br />I immediately traded the book back and will probably avoid reading any of her books in the future.
034580404X|3.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy are all well written and very different from most of reading material on the shelves today. Books show a different lifestyle than most of us know, but books were still fun and a great read!  If you are a stick-in-the-mud type of person, these are not for you.  In one word, HOT!
0345522303|5.0|Lovely book. This is the sixth book in the series. Lynn Flewelling is a master at creating wonderfully complete and fascinating characters, and the new ones introduced in this novel are no exception. For those who have read her other books in the Nightrunner series, this one is centered around intrigue and happenings in Rhiminee. I feel that after exploring other places in the last two books, this is a return to the series' roots. It has a lot of what I feel in love with in the first three novels. Lynn Flewelling also has a wonderful way of keeping relationships between long standing characters both intimate and comfortable, but still spicy enough to keep you interested. I don't want to give the story away, but if you enjoyed the first three books, you will  enjoy this one.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I wish I could give this film more stars. I would give it all the stars in the sky. It is everything a movie should be. It is an experience. It is beautiful. If this movie was a person I would marry it. Then I would divorce it and marry it again. I wish I could live inside of this movie. I wish that I could become all of the characters in this movie and live each of their lives one at a time and watch the movie from each of their angles. It is brilliant. I can't express it. Stop reading this review and go watch The Fall right now. I'm serious. If you are still reading this review, I beg of you to stop and immediately watch this movie. Stop it. Just stop. Go watch The Fall. Seriously, do it. Now. Go. Go watch it. Go on. Go watch The Fall. Stop wasting time and watch it. Go.

B003Q6CUAI|2.0|Even if I always try to buy books in electronic form, the e-book format of this one is impossible to manage. I suggest that you get the \\"on paper\\" one. You will frequently need to cross sections and to compare hints from various chapters if you really want to stick on the diet, and the kindle is not the master of speed at tasks like this if it is not properly helped by a clean electronic layout. I mean that the content is the same of the paper edition but that content has not been adapted for a pleasant electronic reading experience. This is another clear example of the wrong thing to do with a \\"reference\\" book that is meant to be consulted \\"on need\\".
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|When watching this movie I was not at all surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie as it offers so much to the audience, to name a few aspects of this movie that I enjoyed very much would have to be action,suspense,a very well written story,drama, character development, and much more. This movie is set in Alaska and this certainly adds to the challenge of staying alive, we even get a really good look at how this environment affects each character. (No I don't just mean the shivering or a red nose) What I mean is that the weather slowly but surely wears each and every character down, even to the point where one character dies due to the weather. You (the audience) begin to get a feel for just how scared and desperate each character  becomes as their hope for survival begins to dwindle down to nothing.<br /><br />This story follows 6 oil pipeline workers and a skilled hunter who was hired by the pipeline to protect the workers from the wolves that attempt to attack the workers. While the workers are returning home their plane crashes and they are forced to cooperate in order to survive. However the challenge of survival becomes even more difficult when they quickly realize that a local pack of wolves begins to hunt them one by one and they are forced to fight for their lives. Can the survivors band together,put aside any past differences and make it out alive? Or will they all just perish in the snow?<br /><br />I have to limit exactly what I tell you in this review without spoiling the movie for you, however, I will say that ending  may seem a TINY bit unsatisfying but due to the direction the film was taken, you can see its necessity.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This documentary series is simply beautiful.    I have fond memories of the World at War. I remember borrowing all of the episodes from the library as a child in the 80's. But now as I watch the series again I can really appreciate its significance and its subtleties.    The feel of the series is entirely different from any modern documentary. It feels like the 70's in its production, the camera style, the music, and especially the way it tells the story, which feels so much more dramatic than any other documentary I can feel of. I think Lawrence Olivier plays a big role in this. One of history's greatest actors, he adds to the drama and feel.    Because the series documentary was produced around 1970 it is now as close to the war as it is to us. It interviews many people who were in the war, including many of the main players, Albert Speer, Karl Dönitz (the last Furher), Arthur Harris, Curtis LeMay, Paul Tibbets and Traudl Junge (Hitler's personal secretary). Many of the eyewitnesses are only 50 or so, with fresh memories. They're not the elderly veterans of today.    The series has almost become a living part of of the history of the Second World War in a way that no other documentary can ever become.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|The most realistic war description. Must read. Paints the same picture as the first 40 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Almost Famous is a beautiful movie which works because of many magic ingredients,they include the fantastic direction of Cameron Crowe,the intelligent heartfelt script,the stellar acting by the amazing cast icluding Kate Hudson,Jason Lee,Billy Crudup,Noah Taylor,Anna Paquin,Patrick Fugit & the incredible as always Frances McDormand & Philip Seymour Hoffman,with a cast like this how could this movie not be great? However the biggest asset to the success of this movie is the incredible music which is pivotal to the narrative of the story,the stunning soudtrack is ably backed by the infusion of the mythical band Stillwater and the stunning life concert footage which is incorporated into the movie.I love this movie & cannot recommend it highly enough,if you love music then it is a must see & if you dont like Elton Johns \\"Tiny Dancer\\" after seeing it then you have no heart,soul or appreaciation of music!
B0041B785Y|4.0|Not a whole lot to review, good metal cd. I listen to it when I lift weights. Nothing ground breaking but good to listen to. If you like the band, its more of the same. Pick it up, or just give the other cds another listen to. Gave it 4 out of 5 because alot of the songs run together. Would have liked something a little different to break up the sound.
6305278016|5.0|Except for the title and the end of the explanation on it and the whole US Jazz it's a pretty good movie,I Don't care for Douglas,I watched it for Andy Garcia who does a Tremendous Job.Guzman(John Leguizamo's Buddy,briefly in there),The Bike Races,The Harley,The Suzukis,The Plot and story are all great.The Action is just as good and The Yakuza is all there,I would watch it again.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|The first didnt set the bar high but this was a lot better. Give this one a chance, you will like it better than the first film which was a bad remake. I picked it up on blu ray and it looks great. Good Storyline, Good Action. Everything better in every way. Gave it 4 out of 5 just because it wasnt rated R. Im sure that isnt a good response to the rating system but its my opinion.

1605149217|5.0|It is hard to put a finger on exactly what I loved about this book the most. I think it was deep feelings expressed when the main character, Lin, came upon the truth.  Usually unexpected, often painful, the spiritual lessons learned in the book caused this reader to really think about what is truly important in life. The only issue I had was believing the portrayal of the criminal characters in the book. Most of the hard-core criminals I have met in my life have been sociopathic and would turn on a \\"brother\\" in a second if it served them. Other than that, loved the book. The texture of life in Bombay was described in such a rich and beautiful way. The characters are so interesting and complex. Wish it was another 900 pages.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Loved it. Really great for the kids too. They play it over and over. Can't wait for a sequel.  Worth the price.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun app.  Need friends and an easier way to get them.  A great way to spend down time.  Good job.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I generally read only fiction but for some reason this one caught my eye... this should be required reading for all high schoolers... while a somewhat tough read at times it is the kind of book one cannot put down for very long... it captures your mind. What people do to survive is beyond the minds of most people who live in a free society.
B00846REIS|4.0|This story was pretty hot. The sex scenes were hot and steamy, and the setting was a perfect fantasy. Who wouldn't love the dream of running into Mr. Hot and Sexy at work and having him come right out and tell you like it is?<br /><br />The characters were done well for the most part. Cross was, well, Cross. I don't really know what to say about him except YUM. I guess that's really enough.<br /><br />Eva was, well...for the most part I liked her. She was strong and independent, knowing what she wanted and not afraid to go after it. I didn't, however, like the way she reacted to things...Yes, I know she was traumatized and running was her way of dealing, but really, it got old. Example: At one point she says (or thinks) she can't stand the thought of being the next in a line of many, and yet that's exactly what she agreed to with Cross. He laid out pretty clearly how it was going to be for him, and she accepted his deal, so she shouldn't have acted like a jealous girlfriend, getting mad because he obviously had had sex with other girls. She drove me nuts sometimes. Her reactions seemed very childish to me, and I had trouble keeping up with her bipolarity.<br /><br />The story itself was pretty predictable. For the most part I knew where it was going. I probably would have enjoyed it a bit more if I had not already read 50 Shades. Overall, if you like 50 Shades, you'll like this book.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is simply amazing! It makes me feel like I'm apart of the movie because the characters really come alive!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Seriously, the repetitive \\"Oh my!\\" was simply off-putting and distracting and had me wondering if the author bottomed out of her vocabulary bank prematurely.  Further lack of impression came with the repetitions of vanilla sex, her lip biting, him telling her not to lip bite or else, etc. etc. etc.  This writer writes like she is referencing from a very, very limited pool of information.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I've watched this movie three times just this week. It's going to be one of those movies I can watch again and again. The casting is marvelous as Owen Wilson as a man, Gil Pender, who glorifies 1920 Paris and all the literary greats who at one time or another, lived there. While in Paris on a midnight stroll at the stroke of midnight, a car shows up and takes him to a most extraordinary party, in attendance are The Fitzgeralds (Zelda and Scott) and Cole Porter who belts out tunes at the piano. Gil Pender is a screenwriter wannabe novelist who would rather live and work in an attic office in Paris than marry and move to Malibu like his snotty fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) would prefer and this party blows him away. Later he meets, (an amazing likeness of) Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, and Picasso. He also rubs elbows with Dali, who is magnificently played by Adrian Brody (my favorite part of the film) and many other artists and writers from the 1920s. Woody Allen has created a work of genius in this understated film.<br /><br />As Gil's personal relationships grows with the greats of the past, he comes to some realizations of his present life. For a while he bounces back and forth between his current vacation in Paris and Paris in the Golden Age. This is really a neat film and if you enjoy stories of such as A Moveable Feast, you will really enjoy this lighthearted comedy.<br /><br />I enjoyed all of the performances in the movie and found the cast to be amazing and the script first rate. This is a really charming movie and I haven't been that interested in Woody Allen's movies in the last ten years or fifteen years, but this one has the old magic. It's like Manhattan in the way that you can watch it more than once.
0345529057|4.0|My sons love these books (young adult and teenagers)!  They have plowed through them during the recent heat wave...I find the writing a bit thick at times, but I have enjoyed sharing the characters with my sons.  Definitely worth the money and the time!
1586487981|5.0|I read this book when it was first published and recently re-read it because I was curious to know (a) what I had missed the first time and (b) to what extent (if any) the book has since lost relevance since it was written more than two years ago. My conclusions? I missed several key points, and, the book's more relevant now than it was then.<br /><br />As Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo explain, they focus on the \\"very rich economics that emerges from understanding the economic lives of the poor. It is a book about the kinds of theories that help us make sense of both what the poor are able to achieve, and where and for what reason they need a push.\\" Frankly, the first time around, I did not pay sufficient attention to the material that focuses on the details of poor families' daily lives: their dreams, their fears, their frustrations, and (yes) their noble qualities.<br /><br />Banerjee and Duflo are correct to suggest that their book \\"is ultimately about what the lives and choices of the poor tell us about how to fight global poverty...And it reveals why so many magic bullets of yesterday have ended up as today's failed ideas...Above all, it makes clear why hope is vital and knowledge is critical, why we have to keep on trying when the challenge looks overwhelming. Success isn't always as far away as it looks.\\" I agree. But it is also true that success isn't always as near as it looks.<br /><br />They provide an abundance of information, insights, and counsel that can help their reader to do some \\"radical thinking of the way to fight global poverty.\\" Here are some of the several dozen passages that caught my eye:<br /><br />o  The nature and extent of poverty's impact on eating habits (Pages 22-28)<br />o  A \\"nutrition-based poverty trap\\" (38-40)<br />o  The \\"health trap\\" (43-48)<br />o  \\"Supply-Demand Wars\\" (72-76)<br />o  \\"The Curse of Expectations\\" (86-93)<br />o  \\"Why Schools [in Developing Countries] Fail\\" (93-97)<br />o  \\"Reengineering Education\\" (97-100)<br />o  \\"What Is Wrong with Large Families\\" (106-111)<br />o  \\"Children as Financial Instruments\\" (119-123)<br /><br />Rather than add to the number of demonstrably ineffective \\"magic bullets,\\" Banerjee and Duflo suggest a few points to keep in mind when thinking about how to improve the lives of the poor: \\"First, the poor often lack critical pieces of information and believe things that are not true...Second, the poor bear responsibility for too many aspects of their lives...Third, there are good reasons that some markets are missing for the poor, or that the poor face unfavorable prices in them...Fourth, poor countries are not doomed to failure because they are poor, or because they have had an unfortunate history...Finally, expectations about what people are able or unable to do all too often end up turning into self-fulfilling prophecies...Despite these five lessons, we are very far from knowing everything we can and need to know.\\" Be that as it may, Banerjee and Duflo are to be commended for how far, how deep, and how well thy have increased our understanding. Thank you.<br /><br />According to a Chinese proverb, the best time to plant a tree was 100 years ago; the next best time is now. The same can be said for reducing - if not eliminating - poverty in the world.<br />o  \\"What Is Wrong with Large Families\\" (106-111)<br />o  \\"Children as Financial Instruments\\" (119-123)<br /><br />Rather than add to the number of demonstrably ineffective \\"magic bullets,\\" Banerjee and Duflo suggest a few points to keep in mind when thinking about how to improve the lives of the poor: \\"First, the poor often lack critical pieces of information and believe things that are not true...Second, the poor bear responsibility for too many aspects of their lives...Third, there are good reasons that some markets are missing for the poor, or that the poor face unfavorable prices in them...Fourth, poor countries are not doomed to failure because they are poor, or because they have had an unfortunate history...Finally, expectations about what people are able or unable to do all too often end up turning into self-fulfilling prophecies...Despite these five lessons, we are very far from knowing everything we can and need to know.\\" Be that as it may, Banerjee and Duflo are to be commended for how far, how deep, and how well thy have increased our understanding.

B001TH16DI|4.0|It was difficult making this tv series into a movie series primarily because the show was about Kirk, Spock, and Bones, and the movies try to portray Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, and Chekhov as well, and it is difficult to have much character development in a 2 hour movie. However, this is mostly a product of 80's cinematography than any flaws with Trek itself. These movies stil stand up well today, especially compared to the other films of their era.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|First of all, I won't lie-I am a major fan of hopeless romantic mushy stuff and steamy sex scenes in books. That is originally why I started reading the sample, but was pleasantly surprised that this book had much more going on!<br /><br />I thought the summary of the book sounded interesting and needed a good, cheap read. I thought the premise of a college girl who meets a college boy who happens to be a fight club member would be different and maybe okay. I was so so so wrong! It was great! I read through the book in 2 days, and was sad to finish it. I even found myself getting so wrapped up in the emotion and the goings on in the book that I teared up a few times, got very angry with the lead character and laughed out loud many times.<br /><br />I will say, however, that I do agree with other reviewers about some typos and serious grammar issues, but each and every book I read has a few, and I didn't find it to be that big of a deal.<br /><br />Basically, if you are looking for a good book with good characters and you like these types of books, I think it's wonderful! If you are \\"too good\\" for romance novels and find all of those love scenes repulsive, then you are not very bright for reading a book like this. I found it refreshing and real and lots of fun to read. In fact, I am still hooked on these characters, days later and would LOVE to read a sequel.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|People often mistakenly think these films are science fiction when they are in fact fantasy. That being said, it's not fair to compare them with Star Trek, especially since there have been no live-action Star Wars tv shows, except the one they're still trying to get off the ground. However, Star Wars did a better job than Star Trek in terms of films and telling a dramatic story in those films. The Trek movies are more action-oriented, which is to be expected for any science fiction show translated into film. I used to read the Star Wars novels that took place after episode VI, I always though that they would make episodes VII, VIII, and IX with the cast of the original trilogy, but I guess it was not to be. I first saw the Special Edition in theaters with my childhood friend 15 years ago, and episode III came out when I was in college, so these movies bring back fond memories of those days.

B0080QTZNO|5.0|Ever had one of this \\"wish I'd known this sooner\\" moments? After reading Stephen King's 'On Writing', I had one of those moments.<br /><br />I wish I had read this wonderful, entertaining, and absolutely edifying guide to the craft of fiction writing when it was first released twelve years ago. It probably would have reduced the number of drafts on my first novel. Happily, much of the advice King offers I had employed in my second novel (due out in Feb. 2013) but as with anything else in life, you never stop learning.<br /><br />King neatly bookends his advice and opinions with engaging highlights from his life starting with his childhood in a single parent family and ending with his recovery after being struck and nearly killed by a van in 1999. In between his reminiscings, King offers pithy advice on many aspects of writing including characters, story, theme, research, backstory, plot vs. organic storytelling, and moral/meaning vs. resonance. Damn the adverbs and not so hot on critique groups or writing classes either is Mr. King.<br /><br />What King is keen on in his memoir: write the first draft quickly and for yourself (with the door closed to the outside world), write the second draft and revise with the door open (allow your Ideal Reader to review your manuscript). The only dated advice in the book deals with publishing. In 1997, when King began this project, self publishing was still considered \\"vanity press\\" and nowhere near the booming industry that it has become wherein NYT bestselling authors have dumped their agents in favor of publishing their work directly.<br /><br />When it comes to the craft of storytelling, 'On Writing' is a recommended read especially for the burgeoning writer.
B004QL7K6G|1.0|As much as I like Jennifer Aniston, this is a very bad movie.<br />In order to fully appreciate how bad this movie really is, one has to watch it till the very end. At first, it seems that the wife of the couple is the stupid one, while the husband is just tired and unlucky. But at the end it gets clear that both are complete idiots (and that is why they are married).<br />There are only few funny jokes.  Most of them are captured in the trailer for this movie.<br />If you are still curious, watch it, but do not spend too much money. I spent around 20 dollars on DVD. It does not worth it.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I am a long-time fan of Follett's historical novels starting back with \\"The Man from St. Petersburg\\". \\"Fall of Giants\\" did not disappoint. Another enthralling story from one of the world's masterful storytellers. As a writer myself, [[ASIN:B007MEYERM PISAQ PIPELINE, A World-Heritage Mystery]], I enjoy how Follett weaves multiple stories together and creates diverse and deep characters. I can't wait for the next in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The premise of the story is engaging but this could have been done with less verbage. By the middle of the third book I could hardly wait for it to be over. This story would better if it had been told in two longer, more concise books. I had originally thought I'd like to see the movie but after reading the books, I don't need a reprise.

There's an introduction in each book for each film going into the origins of the character, and guides you into how the filmmakers and designers began to make each film.<br /><br />If you're a Marvel fan and especially if you're a fan of the films you should definitely pick up this set! Iron Man and Iron Man 2 books have been out of print for quite some time and now is a good chance to get in on this deal!

It would be nice if  one were given options to change the symbols, as some other versions do. The shuffle option is a nice  way to avoid \\"losing\\". Nice background music. Also a good selection of boards. One other thing this version could use is a set of rules or hints. There are some available matches that make no sense to me; no doubt a more experienced player would understand them. Having a way to look up the rules would be helpful.
B0057GYO9K|2.0|I'm going to start saying that i'm reviewing a FLAC rip of the CD album. The vinyl might sound better, but I doubt it. The music fails to take you in and out of highs and lows that originally gave the \\"alternative\\" to alternative rock. A listen to the solo of In Bloom makes it seem as if Cobain wasn't playing the way he used to, the music stays on the same plain throughout the album. The original greatness of the album was dumbed down to plastic wrap this masterpiece into something sellable and displaceable. Stay with the 1991 version.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Twenty years after Joe's last album, this is so reminiscent of his style from various albums of his past.  Funny songs as well as thoughtful songs fill this album.  The DVD interviews show a mature and thoughtful side to a man who has stood the test of time.  He is humbled that \\"Life's Been Good\\".    My entire family (8) enjoyed his performance at Rib Fest in Naperville, IL on 6.30.12 where he played a few of the new songs from this album as well as old standards.  He still is lively and funny.    You will enjoy this album immensely after a few listens as we do!    [...]
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This book is an excellent study in defending Keynesian stimulus ideas for the 21st century, against modern critiques from so-called neoclassicists. Krugman spends much of his time responding to legitimate arguments from the opposition and most of the time (though not always) responds with legitimate counters in favor of his own solutions. The book could've been longer for all that it covered, but it forms an excellent basis from which to begin.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Awesome game but if you run out of money you cant start over and you have to buy more coins.
B0000009S3|5.0|Outstanding jazz! Great Jazz/Rock (after all, that's F.Z.)!! Heavy, convulsive guitar riffs. And that sax player sounds just like Charles Lloyd. I would rate this in the top 15 of Zappa's best albums. A precurser to his much later album, 'Jazz from Hell'. Cheerio.

B007XNAQPG|5.0|Really, other reviewer? Give up the ghost. If you want \\"Save a prayer\\", pop in any of their other many, many DVDs. DD has such a hugely diverse catalogue, let's not gouge the star rating because a single from their second record isn't on their concert film released almost 30 years later.... AGAIN. The same people who complain about this sort of thing are usually the ones who only know them for \\"Hungry like a wolf\\". DD have grown, evolved & melded into a still-relevant band well into their career. I'm counting down the days until this is released! Don't let this other fairweather fan fool you, this performance is full of visual candy, familiar songs & new favorites - MORE than  enough for even the super-fan. Once again, another stellar performance film from one of the most influential bands ever. Long live Duran Duran!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Forget the adolescent plot.  Forget it's porn.  Both can be fun when one is in the mood and the writing is decent.  But this isn't fun and the writing is far from decent.  It's bad, bad writing and shows a sad state of affairs for both the publishing industry and for readers so devoid of intellectual nutrition that they could actually take the time to, 1) read past the first book, and 2) write a review praising the virtue of this literary slop.  I pray this is only a hiccup in our nation's intellectual indigestion.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I read this, and all of Herriots' similar books, (there are several), several years ago.  I remember them fondly.  I laughed, I cried, I savored each chapter/story; as each chapter was a story on its own, and each chapter contributed to the whole.  The first time I flew through it.  The many times I've read it since - so many times pages are now taped into place - I have slowed down and savored it.  This book is a true gem.

0525478817|5.0|I picked this book up expecting another great read from John Green and indeed I was not dissatisfied. The book was everything I expected and more. From the beginning, I became attached to the characters and the plot. Though it took me a while to finish, I had a blast reading it and laughed out loud many times (a side of reading Green's books). I hope that John Green continues to produce  awesome works like this one and providing his readers with another gem on paper.
034580404X|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not normally a \\"reader\\". I started this book because of the hype surrounding it, because all of my friends were reading it. I read the entire series in less than a week. I restarted it the evening of the day I'd finished the third book. I have now read the entire story twice... In a little more than 3 weeks. I found that I enjoyed it the second time around much more , simply because I took my time and read for detail, not just content. I found the characters intriguing and enjoyed watching them evolve as lovers. Sure, there were moments where I skimmed and felt like I needed more \\"story\\" and less sex, but all in all, I found it an extremely pleasureable, an obsessive read. There are critics out two read WAY too much into the story...the poor, naive girl, and this sick, twisted control freak...tell them to calm down...it's just a story. It will leave you wanting more, but at the same time it leaves you with a sense of finality. I will likely read it again, someday. It is now one of my most favorite LOVE stories, ever. ENJOY!

0321811984|4.0|I periodically require an intellectual re-fueling in this topic of \\"Presentation\\". You know when you are needing a reset because of the nagging self-assessment that happens in your head after an important presentation. You can get very screwed up listening to the opinions of professional `others' regarding the way your message is best translated ... too much ... to little ... etc. Opting to tune-up your presentation skills is always an opportunity to yield payback.<br /><br />Presentation Zen provides an 'approach', not a method. Getting your head into creating the desired outcome is best done at the beginning. It beats passing the preso around 'for comment'.<br /><br />\\"Zen\\", rev 2 is a very good opportunity to reconsider your method and you're your own mental adjustments. I liked it.
B00005JN8Z|4.0|Recalling watching this on late night TV in adolescence, I decided to buy it so my children could have a better understanding of early Christianity.  I also remembered, correctly, that it was a sumptuous production that \\"could\\" have been made by Cecil B. DeMille, although it wasn't.  While it might not be historically exact -- few such movies are -- it gives quite a good impression of the early-Christian, Utopian point of view contrasting with traditional Roman ideas of military virtue.  The color is more vivid and brilliant than reality, the crowd scenes have thousands of extras, and the costumes and sets are worthy of the majesty of Imperial Rome.  The story of Nero's decision to burn the city and blame the Christians, triggering the first of Rome's many attempts to wipe out the semi-subversive sect, is a classic farce proving that absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The film's representation of the apostle also rings true -- how could it not, when his speeches are obviously cribbed from the New Testament?  It also has a troubling, but deft and politically incorrect, subplot where Senator Petronius's Spanish slave girl declares she's madly in love with him.<br /><br />On the other hand, acting is a bit spotty.  Peter Ustinov is perfect as Nero, although he plays him as a somewhat appealing, misunderstood rogue of an antihero rather than as the monster he seems to have been if you read what passes for primary sources, such as Suetonius.  Robert Taylor is a good choice for Marcus Vinicius, with just the right brusque, soldierly manner, but he is much too young to be believable as a commanding general, and he handles his conversion to Christianity rather more clumsily than his early scenes.  The naming of Deborah Kerr's character as \\"Lidgia\\", after the kingdom that sent her to Rome as a hostage, seems clumsy.  Ancient Lydia had been a mere province since the 5th century BC when it had had its fatal encounter with the Persian Empire, and they clearly just made up thename.  Surely, they could have used a real place-name.  Nero's queen (evidently a second marriage or a mistress, since it is stated that he'd put his wife and mother both to death earlier) does not ring true as a character.<br /><br />My copy also had awkward \\"freeze-ups\\" every now and then that definitely detracted from enjoyment of the story.  But, this is an old fashioned, big budget movie with an entertaining story that will also painlessly teach you some history.  It is inexpensive for what you get.  It deserves 4 stars, maybe more if my copy, or perhaps my player, hadn't had that freeze-up problem.

0321525655|4.0|Presentation Zen provides an 'approach', not a method.  I thoroughly enjoyed Reynolds US-expat view from his Japanese corporate perspective. His use of the `bento box' was a detail that the frequent traveler on Japanese rail will immediately recall as curiously `different' but just as quickly forgotten as the info overload of Japanese culture re-captures your minds eye. Reynolds frequent use of the bento box as presentation `zen' might pass over the unfamiliar reader. Native Japanese presentations, in my experience, are either garishly information overloaded, or best not used at all. So, I've never seen the elegant expression Reynolds serves up in the Japanese corporation.<br /><br />I periodically require an intellectual Red Bull on this topic of \\"Presentation\\" after delivering a string of Power Points that just seemed to be so great when you created them, but the reception feels underwhelming.  If you sense the feeling I'm talking about, this nagging self-assessment that happens in your head, it needs sating. Presentation Zen does a great job re-centering the process.<br /><br />You can get very screwed up listening to the opinions of the picayune professional that confuse the quality of `bullet points' for the forest of the total. Opting to self-tune method and skills is my preferred choice to yield the greatest payback.<br /><br />\\"Zen\\" is a very good opportunity to reflect on your method.

I figured I wouldn't watch the whole thing in its entirety the first time because of the length (approx. 100 min), but I couldn't look away. Even though I knew all the songs I couldn't skip a single one. I fell in love with Adele's personality and talent all over again and cried with her while watching the performance. I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of her raw emotion and bit of a sailor's mouth. (;

B006OV7S1I|5.0|MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is NOT a psychological thriller in the normal sense of the genre, and I don't like the idea that it's been marketed as one. This film is the examination of a young woman who has had her psyche played with, twisted, and ultimately rewritten through the machinations of a very charismatic cult leader.<br /><br />For those of you casual moviegoers who are thinking about renting or buying the film, think about it like this: Remember the scene in THE AVENGERS when Loki sticks his scepter into Agent Barton's chest and it gives him the power to take over his mind? Imagine the process behind that 10 seconds of screentime turned into a two-hour film.<br /><br />Again, that might sound boring to some, and those are the people who are giving this film a one-star review. I don't necessarily blame them. This is a film being touted on this very page as a \\"psychological thriller\\", and that evokes certain ideas of a more visceral nature, but while I don't blame them, I certainly would never agree with them.<br /><br />MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is one of those rare gems where the film is so hyped and so well-reviewed within the indie film circuit and it actually lives up to the praise it deserves. The way that the film could actually honestly be construed as a psychological thriller is in the way that the viewer is sent on this incredibly unsettling and emotionally terrifying journey into the mind of a young girl who's mind has been ripped apart and rebuilt to suit the needs of others that any attempt at normalcy is likely futile.<br /><br />It's unsettling in every way: Amazing performances are turned in by most of the cast here first and foremost by relative newcomer Elizabeth Olsen (who thankfully is taking a much different career path from her two older sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley) and the always fantastic John Hawkes, who despite turning in great performances for years in the mostly indie circuit, he was finally recognized in a more official way in 2010 by being nominated for his performance in the similarly unsettling WINTER'S BONE. Also in terrific form is Sarah Paulson (who I only really remember from the great HBO original film GAME CHANGE) as the sister who tries everything to assist. Also the narrative structure as composed by writer/director Sean Durkin in his masterful feature debut is quite unsettling as well. With the seamless transition between Martha's present and her past, we're never jerked or yanked to either place (which is a trope of present/past/present transition), but rather just transported.<br /><br />Many reviews comment or complain on how \\"stupid\\" the ending of this film is because it doesn't seem to have one. This is actually one of Durkin's strengths showing through and one of the film's greatest strengths. This is a film that is designed to make you think long after the credits have rolled; the imperative word being THINK. 99% of films out there are fully content (and most of them rightfully so) to give you the ending so that when the credits roll, you leave the experience with a sense of closure. I'm not saying this is wrong; most films deserve a clear-cut ending. But Durkin is a smart enough filmmaker to say that THIS film doesn't get an ending; he's saying to the audience that, like Martha, you don't know how this is going to end and that is one of the things that makes this film so haunting. You think about it for hours and days.<br /><br />As a brief side note, there's one of the one-star reviews here claiming that this film would have worked better in the 60's or 70's because this was only happening then and it just doesn't happen anymore. If anything, there are more of these small cults around than ever. Young people are very malleable, and if you have a leader that is strong, charismatic, and seemingly loving, they end up exactly where Martha ends up. It's dangerously ignorant to believe that this doesn't happen in this day and age. This isn't some kind of fantasy film about an alternate universe; this happens a lot more than most people would like to think.<br /><br />Watching this film was a wholly unnerving experience, and it's so wonderful in its execution of honest performance and uniformly disturbing story. MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE is a film that will challenge you and it will force you to think long after the credits roll, and hopefully will also catapult Elizabeth Olsen into stardom as well as allow Sean Durkin to continue making such fantastic films.lternate universe; this happens a lot more than most people would like to think.<br /><br />Watching this film was a wholly unnerving experience, and it's so wonderful in its execution of honest performance and uniformly disturbing story.

0444015620|5.0|I am taking an upper division neuro class at a university geared toward occupational therapists, and the required book is much much smaller than this one, but totally unreadable.  It makes no sense at all.  Then I notice my professor's notes all cite Kandel & Schwartz 4th ed.  Then I check out the Look Inside feature on amazon and I see a book that makes sense!  I could get the 3rd ed in new condition for ten bucks, so I bought it, and suddenly I have a chance of getting an A in what is hands-down the hardest class I have ever taken.

The combat is a little crappy,  but still functions. The only huge complaint I have is that the guy they got to do the voice.for Spiderman sounds like a downsey tellatubbie. If you find web swinging therapeutic like I do, $6.99 is a decent price to have it on the go.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|The President's Club is a refreshingly different kind of read.  There are plenty of Presidential biographies.  This book is not about Presidential accomplishments.  It is not also about post-presidential accomplishments, such as the well know Clinton Global Initiative (CGI, as it is known).  Rather this book explores the relationships between current Presidents and e-Presidents.  i.e. how did ex-Presidents partner with current ones.  Very well written with fun and telling anecdotes.  As I read through this list starting from Truman's Presidency through to Obama, I thought it would be fun to subjectively rate some of these relationships:<br /><br />Best:  Hoover helping Truman get food supplies to 100 million starving Europeans after WWII (wow!)<br /><br />Second best:  Nixon helping Clinton deal with Yelstin.  This is a really cool story!<br /><br />Worst:  Jimmy Carter annoying pretty much everybody<br /><br />Delicious:  Johnson and Nixon trying to outfox each other<br /><br />Most fun anecdote:  Reagan teaching Clinton how to salute.<br /><br />If one is interested in Presidential history, this is a new and refreshing angle on this well worn path.
1468161660|5.0|This book deserves EVERY 5 star rating out there and then some! If I could give it more stars, I would!<br /><br />I began reading not knowing anything about the story line or what was going to happen. The synopsis had me very intrigued and I couldn't wait to get started. The writing pulled me in immediately -- I was hooked from the very beginning. The love between Lake and Will is wonderfully intense from the get go, and I couldn't imagine WHAT could possibly happen to get in the way of their bond. Once the awesome twist was revealed, I was like: Yup. That would definitely suck, and throw a giant monkey wrench in their relationship! Then I had to keep reading to the end to find out HOW they were going to get around this obstacle and figure out a way to be together even though everything in their lives is keeping them apart.<br /><br />I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK to anyone and everyone! I loved the story, LOVED the characters -- each one was fully fleshed out and had a life and backstory of their own -- loved all the twist and turns, and especially loved the excellent writing and attention to details. The second I learned there was a sequel, I got on Amazon and purchased it right away. Can't wait to read it!

0307592731|5.0|I heard the hype about \\"Wild\\" earlier in the year, and I dismissed it as \\"Eat, Pray, Love in the Woods.\\" I didn't like that book, and I had no interest in reading about another self-centered and self-indulgent woman. But then I saw an excerpt of \\"Wild\\" in a magazine and thought, \\"What the heck. I'll give this a shot.\\" The excerpt featured Cheryl as she prepared her backpack in the motel the evening before she began her trek. I'm so grateful I took the time to read the excerpt, because I was struck by her beautiful writing and her honesty and humor, and I was persuaded to read the full memoir.<br /><br />Cheryl made the decision to hike the Pacific Coast Trail rather impulsively at the age of 26. She was devastated by the death of her mother and her recent divorce, and she sets out alone on the PCT as a kind of emotional cleansing. Her lack of preparation leads to many mistakes, from the weight of her pack to her ill-fitting shoes. But she learns on the fly, and she benefits from the advice of the more seasoned hikers she encounters on the trail.<br /><br />I was filled with a mixture of admiration and envy while reading \\"Wild.\\" It's impossible not to respect the courage it took for Strayed to set out on her own, even though she severely underestimated the hardships she would encounter. At the same time, I found myself wishing I would have done something like this in my twenties. At almost forty, and with all the encumbrances (physical and otherwise) that go along with it, such a trek seems nearly impossible. But with \\"Wild,\\" I felt like I was walking alongside Cheryl, experiencing the heat, hunger, solitude, and most of all, the exhilaration, right along with her.
1439156816|5.0|It's been a long time since I laughed out loud reading a book or talked back to it. That seems even more amazing when you consider it's only a book about writing. I guess that's what makes Steve a good writer.<br />All these years I have held my long forgotten critiquers in contempt for not approving of my writing when I was in school. Steve had his 'ahaa' moment when he was working for a small newspaper. The editor handed him back his article with a lot of corrections. Instead of being put off Steve realized - 'ahaa' - the key to writing. \\"Rule 17 - omit needless words\\". I'm 43 and just had my 'ahaa' moment when I read about Steve's 'ahaa' moment. My critiquers were right. Thanks Steve, better late than never.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This was quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.  The characters are unlikeable, the plot is ridiculous, the writing style grating.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so adicting and fun. I downloaded it and have been playing for days. my kids play it for hours on end and I just love the animation
B004MC8CA2|4.0|the only bad thing is I cant use it outside of the house because I don't have wifi on my kindle everywhere.
B00782O7NE|3.0|I thought the film was fine.  It parades itself as being a black and white film but though the final print was in black and white the film was actually shot in color and converted -- I am not sure one can even buy black and white film anymore.  In any event the tonal palette is more gray and white than black and white, but this appears to have been the director's artistic choice.  If anyone is interested in seeing what a real black and white film can be like go watch the Ghost and Mrs. Muir -- even on a standard DVD it sparkles and shines.  In any event my biggest complaint is the blu ray DVD authoring.  Like so many blu ray disks it has too many previews at the beginning and the content owner makes it difficult to skip them.  How many times do I need to be subjected to the same stupid previews?  And as with so many blu ray disks it was authored without the ability to resume playback.  This means that everytime one stops the film to answer the phone, feed the kid or take a whiz the film starts over -- over with the same stupid previews that are hard to bypass.  I think that many studios must hate their customers to provide products that just don't work well in the home environnment.  In summary I give the film a 4 but the blu ray disk a 2 accounting for my overall score of 3.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Had to delete this downloaf.  My virus scanner warned me not to install. It found a potential threat in the download. So sad because it sounded fun.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I can't believe how bad the acting is in this movie. For the small parts and bits of lines that the big name, big film, popular GUYS in this movie had it wasn't enough to carry the low budget film through the 1:30 hours. It was BRUTAL to finish. The female, while she had a nice body, was absolutely terrible throughout the film. She couldn't have saved her acting career even if she had done a topless scene. Who is Steven Soberberg? lol. I feel like my 3.99 was totally wasted when I rented this from amazon.
B001YV504U|5.0|This movie really stands the test of time. I think this is Kevin Costner at his best. Even if you are not a fan of baseball, you will still find this movie enchanting!  It may even get you thinking about your own dreams and aspirations and whether you gave up or pursued them with all the passion of your heart! An outstanding family film.
B006O7XOOW|4.0|My 7 month old twins enjoy this new toy.  They understand that you have to move the spinner to get the balls to fall over the sides.  Sometimes the balls stay on the designated tracks, other times they fall over on the floor which is a drawback.  For educational purposes it helps with cause and effect and, fine motor skills,  it has bright colors and peppy music.  Each leg has a different obstacle for the ball to travel down, making for different play opportunities.  I don't know how long this toy will keep a child attention though to make it worth it for its cost.
B003L77G6A|5.0|oH yeah loving it, johnny,jim kaley,kunal & my boy simon, can't get enough of it & i love the fact that all three cds have extra features on them!! loved to see johnny & kaley together talking*sigh* can't wait for season 5 to be released!
B0001Z52RU|1.0|In product detail, it says it has English subtitles, but it's a lie. It doesn't have any subtitles. They're rude that it takes too much hassle for me to return it. I wonder what happen to law?
0385736002|3.0|On par with the Rick Riordan Percy Jackson series. Which is to say, entertaining enough story but a lot of holes and pretty bland characters. Very easy to see where the story is going. I probably would've loved this when I was in elementary school-- much as I loved any sibling adventures (Boxcar Children anyone?) And I'm well aware that the books I loved in elementary school would probably not be interesting to me now. But I was hoping for at least a middle school level of interesting here. That said, the mythology is interesting and if the characters were just a bit more interesting and the plot more complex, the rest of the series might be worth reading.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I did like the movie so much I wanted to ahve the music. I have it in my car for the last 3 weeks and it is still new every time I start it! It is a KEEPER!
0553573403|5.0|I love these books. They are fascinating, entertaining, and extremely enjoyable. They are long, but the chapters fly by. Buy them!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very cute. it has great graphics and lots of things to do.I liked the movie night as well as several other features.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is awesome!!!! its the best game ever and there is also a merida version from brave which is awesome
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been playing this game every night before going to sleep for almost a year now. I have played over 500 rounds total and have never had the same deal twice. worth every penny you don't have to spend
B0086700CM|4.0|A fun game! Endless, but tons of good rewards to shoot for.<br />gets hard fast.  A good mindless game while waiting in line.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game! I would highly recommend it to anyone. great graphics and easy to understand. loved Oregon trail as a kid.
B0086DBE62|1.0|Mirror Mirror was a struggle to watch - the acting was subpar, costumes and sets were mediocre....but mostly it was just a total boring snoozefest; nothing about this adaptation added to the original story-line and there wasn't any sort of character development where you gave two shakes about any of the characters. Watch a rerun of something you enjoyed before wasting time or $ with this....
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|This game is cool and i bought it when it was free. Im just wondering why they raised the price to $1.99.
055357342X|5.0|I love these books. They are fascinating, entertaining, and extremely enjoyable. They are long, but the chapters fly by. Buy them!

B000AJIF4E|4.0|\\"The \\"Fresh-out of the box\\" sound test with my portable iDevice using MP3 tracks I commonly listen too (1 \\"Pop\\", 1 \\"Metal\\", 1 \\"Vocal\\" Tack, and 1 Soundtrack - usually Tron Legacy).<br /><br />First impression:<br />a.) Low-End Bass was way too punchy, and at times over-whelming.<br />b.) The highs were way too tinny and competing, which washed out the mids.<br /><br />Point is my Grado SR-80's were a 5 out 5 out of the box.<br /><br />Since the initial impression I have have been burning them in with pink-noise, low, mid, and high frequency sweeps. I will provide an update after burn-in period is complete (24 Hours).<br /><br />I bring up the Grado's because weather you have the 60's, 80's, or 125 series out of the box they sound warm, well-rounded, with soft high's, and even lows.  The major issue with the Grado's is PAIN.  I have had three pairs and I cant make it past 20 minutes without my ears feeling pinched.<br /><br />These are the second pair of Sony Can's I have purchased. I have the MDR-N60 Noise Cancelling (got on sale in an outlet store).  Those were very accepatble out of the box, however the noise cancellation circuit actual adds noise, so I decided to move up to the MDR-7506 Professional's.<br /><br />Build Quality and Design:<br />a.) These MDR-7506's are well built as far as material qaulity for the price point.<br />b.) Design - There are exposed wires connecting the left to the right can. The issue is that this wire comes out as a loop and is about 18-gauge, which makes me nervous if they catch on anything since the wire is so exposed and at a high-gauge.  I am assuming that this was part of the design which allows the headphone to be fold-able, which by the way, is a smooth and clean action.<br />c.) The cord - The compromise for having that expose wire connecting the two cans is that you have only one side cord-out.  I love having the one-cord design (Which is the other thing about the Grado's which is uncomfortable - two mid-gauge cords dropping from each can).  This cord also has the coil built into it to limit the amount of strain at either end.  The 1/8\\" and 1/4\\" male inputs are nicely gold-plated, and the 1/4\\" connector actually screws onto the the 1/8\\" part, nice touch.<br />d.) The Cans - Good, but would sacrifice an extra 1/2\\" -3/4\\" of depth for a definitively comfortable fit.<br /><br />I know I am being critical considering the 100.00 price point, but these are one of Sony's high-end Headphones (Seen them as high as $229.00 in retail stores).  And I also recognize that I am comparing The MDR-7506's features and benefits to a $500.00 headphone standard.<br /><br />After Burn-in and a few weeks of listening I am expecting the bass will be less punchy, and the mid's will be more pronounced, however that remains to be heard.  I make my initial impression and 2 week impression without a DAC, or any digital signal enhancements.
B0086700CM|4.0|Love this game. But the pause button gets in the way for me, just as rounding a corner my hand hits the pause button somehow and messes the whole thing up for me. grr.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I checked out the calculator apps and found this one to be right on target with my needs. If you're in need of simplicity then this is the one! I like that I can review past entries
B005OCFGTO|1.0|Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BR or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it soo bad on home media!
B0012HCASA|4.0|I enjoyed both seasons, so I am going to post the same review in both seasons.<br /><br />I was not interested in this show when it aire don television, as I am rarely interested in television shows as I am overly pessimistic and think they look.. stupid. Well, I bought prime for the shipping and decided to check out this show. I immediately got hooked. Some reviewers stated that they felt there was a lack of story behind some characters. I never understood this. I get annoyed with flash backs and back story fill. The bit that this show did was more than enough for me. Flash backs and back stories just hinder forward progression in my eyes. Yes in the second season John becomes a little more \\"emotional,\\" but I felt that this was a good thing. he is a High School teenager, and it shows. You can't just make him some badass kid that saves the world right then and there.<br /><br />Overall, good show. Wish there was another season.
B000MV90IU|5.0|This film is probably my favorite of McQueen's. He was the essence of Hollywood cool when he was still around. However, for a Blu-Ray I wasn't that impressed. The picture quality still seems slightly grainy, but for a film made in 1968 I think the Blu-Ray people did as good a job as they could on a film that's 40+ years old. Saw this on the big screen when it first came out. That I will never forget.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I enjoyed this book, I read it in 2 day, just could not put it down. its a great love story.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I had absolutely no idea that I was buying chick-porn.  There was no indication of this in the description of the story.  I say chick-porn as opposed to regular porn, because there is a faint thread of a story between the sex scenes.  There is a damaged man and a sweet virgin who is going to try and cure him. By the time I realised that this was no more than a smutty novel, I also wanted to see him \\"cured\\".  Imagine my disappointment when I got to the end of the novel and I realised it was part of a trilogy and I would have to read \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" to see him cured! The next two titles clearly indicate that it will get worse before it gets better, but I have decided not to waste time and money on the next two in the trilogy.
B004A8ZX0A|5.0|But I'd very much like to see it in Blu-Ray please. I keep checking back hoping to find a release date!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|does what It's supposed to. Makes memes and corrects colors and other edits. fun to play with and send pics to family.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Statham is exceptional in this with a good supporting cast. The story keeps you guessing and the ending is very satisfying. One of those occasional films out of the U.K. that you can really feel. Crazy robbers and tough cops make for a good combination.
B0086700CM|4.0|I wish it had levels its not that difficult and there is alaways a glitches when you jump sometimes. it doesent. let you so there is a little glitch
B0086700CM|4.0|simple, fast paced game. great way to spend the breaks I get from work. on top of that, no need to spend real money to excel.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|The game starts you out nice and easy and by the end of the amateur courses you'll be firing drives off with all kinds of special balls at 9 under.it's just challenging enough to do the unlocks but it's nice that you can spend money you earn in game to unlock them sooner. There are also tons of courses to add to the fun and challenges. HTC evo 3d
0786891416|3.0|Castle, Richard. Heat Wave (Nikki Heat) Sep. 2009 Hyperion. ISBN1401323820 Rated: PG-13 SLV<br /><br />NYPD Detective Nikki Heat is assisted by Officers Ochoa and Raley and impeded by journalist Jameson Rook (although he does provide occasional valuable insights) as she works to solve the suicide/murder of development tycoon Matthew Starr.<br /><br /> Heat Wave is a real whodunit police procedural written with wit, tight dialogue and fast-paced action. The minute I had the mystery solved along came new evidence to put on the white board.<br /><br />ABC television (Monday night 10/9C) has taken on Nikki Heat and made her Detective Beckett and the journalist Jameson Rook becomes novelist Richard Castle, solving crimes in one hour rather than 196 pages.
B005WLQQ4Q|4.0|Perfect band and songs for my 8 year old.  She loves BTR and listens to them every day. I'd recommend this CD to any mom who is looking for something for her young one to try out.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Was not what I expected, however really enjoyed the story.  At my age it is difficult to understand where the ideas come from, but imagination for this was great!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I really like the game itself but every time since a few days I've tried to use. it and it would not work. this is the seventh time ive had to redownload this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!! but I do think that when you have a new highscore and you r getting really far in the game, it's like the game purpously crashes u! :/ But other than that, I love it! My brother and sister love it too! and my mom and dad play it!!!!!!! Bottom line, SO FUN!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like super Mario bros then you'll like this game and never stop playing it. I LOVE LEPS WORLD
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is talented and pretty and seems to be a very wholesome young lady.  I don't mind my 8 year old listening to her and flipping through her album artwork.  She's a great inspiration to the girls out there.  I'd much rather her NOT be listening to someone like Kesha or Katy Perry.....
B007SGM084|5.0|Compeling and very easy to read. It keeps you on the edge all the way to the end of the third book. Great read for anyone who likes a true love story.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The app works as it should.  Lots and lots of data. The main screen looks like a battery containing a fluid. The fluid level indicates the amount of charge, together with a digital readout. When you charge a plug shows up. There are voice warnings of low power. I find myself checking the app several times aday. Try it you'll love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. it has good variety and different levels. many options to choose from like space to land
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love it! I play every chance I get. Have to make myself put my Kindle down to get anything else done.
B002T921AC|4.0|My little girl loves JB, so she's collecting all of his CD's and knows almost all of his songs and it drives me nuts, but I know how it is.  It's one of his earlier CD's (I think) but it's all the same to an 8 year old.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|I'm sure by now that Mr. Young believes in his own mythical status and therefore feels free to release anything his fans will lay money down in order to join the legacy. Fine, no problem. Name any musical artist of long-standing and you will unearth the same level of arrogance. Yes, of course we admire Young's determined whatever to \\"march to the beat his own drum.\\" He once composed albums to please himself and those who appreciate well-crafted musicianship over a wide range of genres. Unfortunately he has abandoned the second half of that equation with \\"Americana.\\"<br /><br />The deservedly respected band Crazy Horse must have been unemployed for a sufficiently extended hiatus to sign on to this abysmal project. And their playing confirms my suspicions. The band sounds bored enough to have recruited barroom hookers into the studio for a just reward.<br /><br />I'm willing to wager that artists of Young's fame never read reviews of  their product, which makes sense in this case because he knows that suckers like me will be caught up in the same bait chum that lures an occasional flounder. I won't bore you with a play-by-play description of these dreadful interpretations of important songs that helped fashion the American sense of musical uniqueness. Young accomplishes this desecration without the assistance of me.<br /><br />Suffice it say, sans self-righteous indignation, that after years of gambling on Young's musical output enough to peek inside my wallet and flip a coin as to whether to buy or not, the zipper on this slab of leather is shut forever. Neil, it is time for you to contemplate retirement, if not for fans, then for yourself.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love it, very useful and one of my fab apps I recommend it to every one thank you very much

1451683405|5.0|Short and clear review of underlying ideas: are we in command of our thoughts and actions? Easy to read, the author challenges legal and moral issues, in spite of unceasing attacks that our \\"free will\\" makes us guilty and responsible of everything. This book is a major synthesis of his ideas and a shared performance with the publisher to make it brief and jovial. Up until now our analysis and knowledge from psychiatry and neurophysiology has been profuse on the meaning of dreams, lost memory and ageing, forgetting the fundamental driving force of human behavior this book invites to question.
B007XF4J70|3.0|While the image restoration is really decent (not great though) the sound is no better than the previous BD release. The volume level fluctuation is as bad as on the original BD released only months before this one. Neither one, and for that matter the non Blu ray DVD too, even approach the sound quality of the Criterion Laser Disc from the 80's. If you own the first BD release keep it and don't waste your money.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were unique and I liked their development. Good mystery mixed with love and history. I look forward to reading his other books.
B000BKJ78U|4.0|This review refers to the changes made in 1997, generally called Star Wars \\"Special Edition.\\"<br />I think I can sum up Episode IV (A New Hope) this way: new/extended scenes on Tatooine, specifically Mos Eisley, were a mess. I was fine with the other changes.<br /><br />I cannot recall a director ever creating new scenes from scratch like Lucas has done here. I have no problem using the old, but orignal to us scenes such as the one involving Biggs Darklighter. The scenes created from scratch were all failures in my opinion - and they were all on Tatooine. From extra stormtroopers searching for R2 and C3PO on their duneback creatures (or whatever they were called) to an ill-advised scene involving robots, Lucas failed miserably. Of course the most eggregious error Lucas made was changing/re-editing the Han-Greedo storyline. Let's suspend our disbelief for a moment and actually believe what Lucas said was true: that Greedo fired first. If he originally wanted to have Greedo fire first, than that idea would actually be just as bad as editing the scene around. Letting Greedo get the jump on Han makes Han look slow and weak. He was certainly not a weak character and if ANYONE has a gun pointed at them by someone who is threatening to shoot, everyone has the duty to fire first. Lucas did not make this film by himself and surely disappointed many of the other folks who made this film possible. It's hard to believe but this one scene change really sticks with me, as it seems to with other folks.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lucas didn't make similar mistakes in the subsequent episodes. Episode V is my favorite and he didn't butcher it. (Although I'd have been happier if he had Leia kiss Chewbacca and not kiss Luke at all.)<br />I really don't care for either \\"dance\\" number in Jabba's Palace in Episode VI, so the change there doesn't really effect me.<br /><br />Despite some things I liked, the best thing for all of us was if Lucas had left well enough alone and simply cleaned upand remastered his old films the way they were originally shown in theaters.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Love this show. Can't wait for more of it. This is a great series. You will love it also! Get it!
0061692042|5.0|A great story which captures a time and place exceedingly well. I found it hard to put down and have recommended it to others.
B0068FYZCA|1.0|What is it with Universal Home Video and 1973 movies? First they botch the video transfer on JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR with sloppy audio -- music tracks too subdued and muddy -- and now they've done it again with AMERICAN GRAFFITI. Only this time the problem is just the opposite: The music overwhelms the dialogue; it's much too loud and echoing, and it sounds all wrong -- and in a movie where the oldies soundtrack is so important, the balance is destroyed. Like JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, I saw AMERICAN GRAFFITI in the theater, and I know perfectly well it is Not. Supposed. To. Sound. Like. This. It's not supposed to look like this, either. As other reviewers here have noted, the picture is much too dark and murky, with too many video artifacts. Do you remember how AMERICAN GRAFFITI sparkled in 1973? You'd better, because it doesn't anymore. In many important scenes you simply can't see what's going on. I only knew because I remembered.<br /><br />The video transfer on JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is tolerable -- just -- but AMERICAN GRAFFITI has been absolutely wrecked -- both DVD and Blu-ray. It's one of the great movies, too; if you've never seen it, too bad, because you never will if you start here.<br /><br />I'm watching it as I type this, and it's just getting worse and worse; I wish I could give it zero stars. I'd better go ahead and post this now; if I wait any longer I can't be responsible for what I might say. It's just awful.<br /><br />Shame on you, Universal; you're trashing your heritage. That's your privilege, I suppose, if you want to be so careless and stupid and incompetent. But you're trashing my memories too, and you've got no right to do that.
B002LFCPLO|1.0|It was a little hard to follow but in all lacked any excitment. I found it to be dull and boring. Certanly ranked low of any movies he has made.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one of my favorite games installed since I bought my kindle.  would highly reccomend this game to anyone.<br />quite fun besides the random ads. and cant beat a free app to waste time.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|Because the rest of this review may contain a mix of spoilers and mood killers, my conclusion and recommendation will come first.<br /><br />This rates four stars, because it would be a lie if I did not admit that during most of the movie I was having a great time.<br />The music alone is worth your time. The acting is very good throughout. The sets nicely done even if the costuming is somewhat under done. Most of the characters would not have been able to afford the opulence for which this era was famous so this is a minor point. The final recommendation from me is: Rent it, or instant view it once. It is worth one viewing. It is not something you must have at the ready for re-play.<br /><br />Ed Harris is a commanding high energy Beethoven. The directing and writing also has him portray a crude, bore and a sincerely passionate artist. I keep thinking he was Jack Palance, perhaps the two were separated at birth. Diane Kruger as the fictional Anna Holtz manages to handle simpering idol worshiping girl and independent modern professional woman - both convincing.<br /><br />Briefly the movie is a memory flash back from Anna Holtz's point of view. She pushes herself into the great composer's life four days before the premier of the great Ninth Symphony. The crises is/are that he has not finished drafting the composition and he needs a copiest who can transcribe a clean draft and forward it to the music house that will make the hundreds of copies and individual arrangements for the musicians and chorus.  He is almost totally deaf, cantankerous and she is a nascent composer. He sees the artist in her and she earns enough of his respect that they form a<br />professional relationship. There may be a romance between them but we cannot be sure and if so that romance is not a plot driver.<br /><br />Here begin the problems.<br /><br />The movie opens with an overly long carriage ride . We see too many dirty faced sincere peasants doing honest field work, some shot in scenes reminiscent of old Dutch master paintings. Anna Holtz is a highly distressed passenger apparently hearing a small violin group playing music at once familiar and some how not right. The cause of her distress is that she is frantic to get back to Vienna to be at the side of a dying Beethoven.<br /><br />Exactly why we have so many views of dirty faced peasants is unclear. We will never see any of them again nor is there any later reference to them nor are they of any meaning to the plot.<br />From here on the questions keep piling up:<br />Why is Beethoven's nephew in the movie? His stealing is fobbed off by his doting uncle. The young man's impending, forced recital is a topic of much discussion and film time, then he and the recital disappear. OK he gets to come back and cry. So what?<br />Why is so much time spent on Anna Holtz's boyfriend (lover? fiancee?)? He is an engineer/designer, but once he has his run in with the Maestro we never see or hear from him again. Did he benefit by the meeting? Does he give up bridge design?

0345529057|4.0|I fell in love with HBO's Game of Thrones, what a great series!  I'm only about a third through the 1st book and it's little slow early.  I am a little distracted, so I'm not reading a lot, the reason being that I just got a new TV set.  Love the story though. Complex story line like the TV program and I just love it.<br /><br />The book set arrived very promptly.
1439127700|5.0|A perspective on the interactions of Presidents that has gone over looked (by me).  I found the entire walk from Hoover/Truman thru to Bush/Obama/Clinton fascinating.  While we all might get caught up in the day to day politics it good to find that the former Presidents tend to support and provide council for their successors with a regard for the country over politics (most of the time).<br /><br />Throughly enjoyable and east to read.

030758836X|3.0|The book kept me interested, wanting to see what happens next, but after hanging on through all the plot twists and turns, the ending sucked!
B000000OXH|5.0|Following the multi-platinum success of their debut album, prog/melodic rock group \\"Asia\\" attempting to capitalize on the success of such songs as \\"Thrill of the Moment\\" and \\"Only Time Would Tell\\" by putting out an album that would focus entirely on melodic, radio-friendly songwriting. That album was \\"Alpha\\".<br /><br />\\"Asia\\" retain their original line-up of keyboardist Geoffrey Downes, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, drummer Carl Palmer and guitarist Steve Howe and with the former two names at the helm of the songwriting process deliver a remarkable collection of instant-melodic rock classics.<br /><br />\\"Alpha\\", despite its impressive vocal/keyboard performances, is first and foremost about the songwriting. Every song on this second album has perfectly defined opening melody, main body, bridge and chorus. Production-wise \\"Alpha\\" is bigger than its predecessor particularly when it comes to the choirs and backing vocals while the keyboard harmonies and the rhythm patterns are definitely catchier than the ones found on their debut. The optimistic \\"Don't cry\\", the romantic \\"The Smile has left your eyes\\", the epic \\"Never in a Million years\\" and the anthemic \\"My own Time\\" are rightfully considered classics in `80s melodic rock but the pompous \\"True Colors\\" and  the intense \\"The heat goes on\\" are truly unsurpassable moments for the genre.

B005LAIGTG|2.0|While this film is based on true events, I'm guessing Hollywood did a great deal of embellishment to sell this one to the date night crowd.  Certainly the leads are attractive enough.  Paige (Rachel Mc Adams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are the perfect young couple.  She's a budding artist with a very cool studio any artist would die for.  He's a self-employed recording engineer who never goes to work.<br /><br />Together they live in an eclectic apartment in a groovy Chicago neighborhood.  The one where The \\"L\\" glows in a beautiful light blue and quietly passes overhead.  It's winter in Chicago.  The one where the billowy white snow beautifully drifts down, lightly covering the ground.  The one where it's cold, but with no wind, so heavy coats and hats aren't needed.  Well, except for one ugly hat Leo wears to enhance his cool factor.  Paige and Leo are so in love that early in the movie they have to stop at a slick intersection, unbuckle and make out.<br /><br />Little did they suspect the city would have a snow plow out trying to keep the streets clear.  Little did they suspect the driver of said snow plow would be unable to stop before \\"plowing\\" into the rear of their Volvo.  With Paige's head now through the windshield, she is taken to the hospital and put into an induced coma.  Once she is allowed to wake up, she forgets everything from the point of her decision to leave law school and become a sculpturess.  She doesn't remember Leo or her new friends.  Leo frets and fawns over Paige but nothing is helping.<br /><br />She eventually goes back to her parent's (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) mansion in a wooded suburban section of Chicagoland.  She runs into her old boyfriend (Scott Speedman) and almost goes back to law school.  Almost that is until she stumbles upon why she uprooted her life the first time.  The actors do what they can with this simpleton script.  In one scene, Paige rolls up the car windows just so she can enjoy one of Leo's farts.  Puleeze!  I'm not against romantic films or romantic comedies.  In fact, I like them.  At least those that don't overdose me with saccharine.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc looks and sounds great unlike the movie.  A 1080p & 2.40:1 aspect ratio transfer.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The video and audio are both very good and keep you into the film.  Hey, maybe that was the problem.ot against romantic films or romantic comedies.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing the workout for a couple of days and my weight has only budged maybe 1 lb but I have noticed some differences in my arms and stomach. My tummy and arms have shrank a bit and my body feels more firm. My endurance has also gotten a lot better and I can get through workout 1 a lot easier. I don't always use weights because half way through, I feel like they are going to fall off so I go back and forth between weights and the remote controllers. I do find Jillian annoying though, I want to mute her. The song selection is also very bland and I wish they would get louder more upbeat background music. She may be annoying but for $7 combined with the results, I think it is a steal.
B006OB3K56|4.0|McQueen's psychosexual examination of a brother and sister in trouble is fairly clinical, albeit with some rather odd melodramatic touches that make it far less affecting than great films about sex like Bertolucci's LAST TANGO IN PARIS and Mike Nichol's CARNAL KNOWLEDGE.  Fassbender and Mulligan should get credit for courageous performances, while McQueen is smoothly successful working in AMERICAN PSYCHO mode.<br />Icy.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|MI: Ghost Protocol is a worldwide action thriller. The action scenes are very thrilling and will have you at the edge of your seat; Tom Cruise's chase scenes are great as usual. A lot of great shots and well fitted music. The acting was also great. I didn't like the villain though, some of the action scenes with him felt very illogical and he wasn't developed enough. I wanted to see more of him, a little more explanation.<br /><br />Overall, a very fun action film. I definitely recommend at least renting it.<br /><br />A lot of action with some blood and violence, no sex or nudity.

B00846REIS|4.0|I liked the book for the most part, although there was a lot of similarities with 50 shades of Grey it was still a little different.
0425263908|3.0|I read this as a result of a recommendations to read after finishing the 50 shades trilogy TWICE!  Although it was readable, the language was more crude than 50 shades and I dont feel that the plot was as well developed.  I do want to read the next book in the series though to see if it gets better...the characters of Eva and Gideon and much of the storyline seem quite like the characters of Ana and Christian so im interested to see where the author takes them in the next book...
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I was familiar with this movie and wanted my own copy. The movie inspired me to buy several books on Secretariat. Whenever I see a Disney movie about real people or a real situation, I usually want to find out what really happened. My only criticism of this DVD is the sound quality. I have to turn my TV nearly as loud as it will go just to get normal sound. I'm sure devoted racing fans would find things to criticize because of the way the races were run (jockeys standing up in the stirrups early to be sure the right horse won, etc.), but it was exciting, the horses were beautiful, and it was a good story. I would recommend it to anyone who likes any of those things.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was a quick and generally easy read. The story was entertaining. But there were lot of annoying writing habits, including the repetitious nature of the book. After awhile I became a bit exasperated with it. But once I begin a book, I generally like to finish it. I managed it... barely. (It didn't stop me from reading the entire series though!)
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Jamie has a way to draw the attention of readers that makes you want more, makes you ponder what is going to happen next and not able to put the book down. Of course there were a couple of things in the story that made you say that it was almost impossible for a guy to behave that way, it also made you believe in it. I cannot wait to read Travis' POV

B0014D6PCO|4.0|The longer the movie goes, the worse it gets. Don't misunderstand me, I liked this movie. It starts out great and slowly goes down to good, but the whole thing runs out of steam at the end (despite the large amounts of aerosol fear gas at the end, heh heh) and it feels a bit inconsistent. Bruce Wayne talks about how it's never too late to save someone (or in his case save Gotham City) but Batman ignores an opportunity to save Ra's al Ghul's life. The ninja initiation is cool, intense and atmospheric, but the fight scenes as Batman are a jumble of cuts that come too quick to make any sense. That's really the problem right there: the Bruce Wayne sections of the movie are better than the Batman sections. I don't want Bruce Wayne! I want Batman!
0525478817|5.0|On the surface, The Fault in Our Stars sounds like a story about kids with cancer, and some might find this too depressing to read. To look at it this way and walk away would be missing out on a wonderful story that's more than just about kids with cancer, but about love, hope, surviving, and so much more.<br /><br />Hazel is a 16 year old girl who has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer since she was 13. She attends a support group for children with cancer and there she meets Augustus. Gus, enamored with Hazel since he laid eyes on her, tries to befriend her. Hazel, trying to make her mom happy, decides to hang out with Gus, and that was the beginning of it all. One of the things they find common ground in is reading, and Hazel shares her favourite book An Imperial Affliction, by Peter van Houten, with Gus, as well as her desire to meet Peter van Houten. Gus shares his wish with Hazel and the two of them head to Amsterdam to meet with van Houten.<br /><br />John Green basically wrote my review for me when Hazel says (when talking about An Imperial Affliction)<br />\\"Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book\\".<br /><br />I couldn't express more eloquently the love I have for The Fault in Our Stars. I think this is John Green's best book to date. His characters are alive and intelligent, they are well developed and realistic. His descriptions of places - especially Amsterdam - transported me. But, most of all, his story moved me.<br /><br />It's well paced story and there were times when I found myself laughing out loud and times when the tears didn't stop falling. Then there were times when I had to put the book down to look-up airline costs to Amsterdam in the spring. The Fault in Our Stars will pull you many ways and when the final page is turned and the book is closed, the story will stay with you for a while longer. I think this is what a good book does to you and The Fault in Our Stars is such a book.a while longer. I think this is what a good book does to you and The Fault in Our Stars is such a book.

B005723JSQ|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella, I think she is witty and creative but this book felt a bit vacant. It was as if I was reading the antics of the main character of Confessions of a Shopaholic in a slightly different setting. If you want a silly, guilty-pleasure read, this is for you. If you have already read Confessions of a Shopaholic, maybe you should consider a different novel by Kinsella.
0439023483|5.0|The story begins just before the reaping. One male and one female - between the ages of 13 and 18 - are chosen at random to represent their district in the Hunger Games - a brutal fight to death between 24 tributes from the 12 districts, where there can only be one champion. Katniss and Peeta (who she refers to as the boy with the bread) are the tributes for District 12 and are shuttled off to the Capitol to be prepped for the arena. The Hunger Games began years ago when the districts (13 of them at the time) revolted against the Capitol. The Capitol implemented the games as a reminder of that revolt and as a way to control the remaining 12 districts. The teens are first paraded in costumes that represent their districts in an opening ceremony. They are trained and graded on their skill and then they are interviewed, all for the sake of gaining sponsorship (help) in the arena. The twisted and voyeuristic nature of the games is not without genius. The citizens of Panem watch their children prepare for their deaths, and they are helpless to change.<br /><br />When I first picked up the Hunger Games, it took me a few chapters to get into the narrative. The story is told from Katniss's point of view, however, it is written in first person present, so getting into the rhythm of the story took longer for me than most other styles. Overtime I grew to appreciate this style, especially since as a reader; I was experiencing everything as Katniss was and learning only what she knew.<br /><br />Susanne Collins did a wonderful job of describing the dreary and dismal District 12, the hopelessness of its residents and the conflicting feelings that Katniss experiences. After losing her father to a mine accident, Katniss practically raised her kid sister since her mother was useless after her husband's death. Katniss had to grow up quickly, fend for herself and take care of her family; this makes her a fearless heroine, single-minded with only thoughts for survival. This also makes Katniss a very emotionally underdeveloped character. She hasn't had time to mourn her loss, she had to keep going in order to keep her family alive and this comes out as she enters the games.<br /><br />Even though there is a lot of violence in the story, there is still a lot of character growth. Minor characters are given rich back stories and major characters full and by the end of the story, familiar. The plot twists were not immediately expected, there were a lot of times that I found myself wondering what really will happen next and was rewarded with an answer that left me wide eyed and open mouthed. As the reader leaves the arena and view the victory party, there is a feeling of impending doom - President Snow is not happy with the outcome, what will he do to our characters next?<br /><br />While the Hunger Games is written for an older teen audience, I all can enjoy this and there is something in it for everyone.Katniss a very emotionally underdeveloped character.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Deb Caletti once wrote :    \\"It starts so young, and I'm angry about that. The garbage we're taught. About love, about what's \\"romantic.\\" Look at so many of the so-called romantic figures in books and movies. Do we ever stop and think how many of them would cause serious and drastic unhappiness after The End? Why are sick and dangerous personality types so often shown a passionate and tragic and something to be longed for when those are the very ones you should run for your life from? Think about it. Heathcliff. Romeo. Don Juan. Jay Gatsby. Rochester. Mr. Darcy. From the rigid control freak in The Sound of Music to all the bad boys some woman goes running to the airport to catch in the last minute of every romantic comedy. She should let him leave. Your time is so valuable, and look at these guys--depressive and moody and violent and immature and self-centered. And what about the big daddy of them all, Prince Charming? What was his secret life? We dont know anything about him, other then he looks good and comes to the rescue.\\"    The only reason I'm giving this book one star is because I can't give it LESS than one star.    I am literally losing it. This book contains one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever read in any book. EVER.  So here's one excerpt from the book.    Abby slept with Travis and left his apartment in the morning without saying goodbye. This is his reaction, a few hours later :    \\"Travis is a wreck! He won't talk to us, he's trashed the apartment, threw the stereo across the room... Shep [roommate] can't talk any sense into him! He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! It's scaring me! Abby, he's gone nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep's room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,\\" she sighed. \\"His face was... Jesus, Abby. I've never seen him like that. He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door... broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life!\\"    THIS. IS. NOT. OKAY.    It's not okay, it's not okay, it's not okay, it's NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR. A few lines later, Abby calls him and everything's back to normal. NO. I'M SORRY BUT NO. YOU NEED TO STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM HIM!    Stalker :  A person obsessed with another to the point of insanity, I.E. following one everywhere, calling constantly, showing signs of irrational, sick and unhealthy behavior, that can sometimes lead to extreme violence.    It drives me insane to see how stalkerish behavior can be considered as \\"hot\\". This book is really, really disturbing, and I don't understand how it could get published. I got 'til chapter 9 and basically I can't take it anymore.  The guy, Travis, suffers from very, very, VERY serious problems that should lead him straight into a shrink's office (if not prison). I'm serious.    Hey you girls, out there, who gave that book 5 stars, saying you want a Travis in your lives, in WHAT language do we have to tell you : it's NOT normal behavior!  And thank God that you haven't met a guy like him because then that would be dramatic! Don't you understand how pathetic it is - all this characterization into irrealistic, hyper-sexualized, robotic male figures? These stories are all the same!    The guy is drop dead gorgeous, he's dangerous, he's sexy, he wants you even if you're plain like hell and what he feels for you goes beyond words: Edward Cullen, Patch Cipriano, Kellan Kyle, Travis Maddox, Damen Auguste or Dimitri Belikov, they're all the same!    Girls, NO ONE is going to want to watch you sleep, or forbid you to go visit your friends, or try to kill you because they love you so much, because that's not what NORMAL people do!! If you ever have the misfortune to get involved with someone like that, GO FILE A RESTRAINING ORDER already!!!    I find it appalling that young girls actually read this thinking this is exactly how they want to be treated like someday. We're not pets! No one in the world should be allowed to force you into behaving like a child!    And I'm also thinking about boys, they're not exactly the target audience but still; reading this must lead to wonder if this kind of behavior is what chicks like. It just spreads some sort of sickening message, \\"be aggressive, show your jealousy as well as the fact that she's yours, have no limits & be in control, use your strength to make a point, don't let her do what she wants because she doesn't really know what's good for her. You know better\\".    It's so hard to be a teenager, to try to find who you truly are, fiction that is destined to be read by young people has some kind of role, it should set examples instead of showing dysfunctional and extreme codependent relationships like they're normal, because they're not.    YOUNG. ADULTS. That means you're becoming a citizen, that you'll study, get to vote, graduate, get a job and make a living! How could you ever want someone to be that intrusive?? To go as far as breaking your car down so you can't visit a friend?! (yes, Edward Cullen I'm talking about you because YOU STARTED ALL THIS!)    Don't you realize it's an offense to your FREEDOM when a guy's literally forbidding you to get out of his house - even after you've asked him to let you go? When he's dragging you out of the car because you're making out with someone - all this when you're not even involved with him? When he's making you feel like crap because you're seeing someone else?    In fact, I won't even get started on all the stupid reactions of Abby. What kind of girl dates a sweet guy and then goes sleeping in another man's bed every night, when she HAS a choice ? She's just a (stupid, lying and masochist) tease.    Then she encourages Travis to beat the sh** out of someone in the middle of the cafeteria? Seriously? Just because someone whistles at her or something, she says like \\"teach him some manners!\\", and Travis throws himself on the man. Jesus, honestly are you a beast or something?? The poor guy ends up curled up in fetal position, covered in blood and unable to move.    What the hell? How can you stand this? No really, how can you read this? How can you accept it? Where is your sense of civility, or your instinct of protection towards the human kind? How come no one in the cafeteria stands up and tries to stop this? (Easy answer. Because everyone is terrified to get hurt! Like that's normal!)    It scares me so much to see that some people are able to read such violence and yet remain flippant and oh-so-casual like it's no big deal. It makes me wonder, if they ever witness a real beat-up, would they react? Would they care? Or has modern entertainment succeeded in making all forms of abuse look so cavalier that it doesn't shock anyone anymore?    Travis kept opening the door when Abby was with her date on the porch late at night, or coming in the bathroom when she was taking a shower, refusing to get out, and generally being so nosy it was a shocking wonder how NO ONE told him to get lost! And she put up with all this!    It's so genuinely dangerous when a guy's emotionally abusing/blackmailing you, or yelling at you for not obeying him, or trying to manipulate you! It is BUT romantic! I don't care whether the guy's a vampire, or an angel, a rock star, or if it was a bet or not, it's just NOT okay!    How could violence kept being depicted as something acceptable - let alone romantic? They're at a party and he hits a boy who TOUCHES her ARM. Honestly! It's not a game! And she keeps forgiving him, every single time.    How do you think real abusive relationships start? What do you think are the profiles of the men who end up beating up their wives and/or showing extreme paranoiac behavior? (\\"Did you just look at that guy? Did you sleep with him? Are you cheating on me? Don't you lie to me. I can see it in your eyes!\\" This is how it ends, people.)    You just wait a couple of years, Abby. Just wait until he loses it, AGAIN, and ends up taking a swing at you.    Again, awfully stupid and arrogant Abby stays at Travis's apartment and she sleeps in his bed because she doesn't really have a choice. Fine. But the guy's bringing chicks in the living room, organizing a big loud threesome - and one day later, he takes Abby's hand, is all warm and fuzzy saying stuff like \\"you're better than this [I'm not doing you like I do the rest of 'em], that's why I treat you different, don't you ever get near boys or I swear I'll destroy them\\"]  He even says \\"I'll end up in prison if I hear you slept with someone else\\".  When you read something like that your alarm must spark off!! I don't know what to say anymore because honestly I feel like I shouldn't have to say all this. This should be like, SURVIVAL INSTINCT.    What is this message that's conveyed? Should we girls be standing on the corner, watching our love interest that pretendedly loves us sleep with the whole planet and calmly stating \\"I can deal with his behavior because, well, he's really hot\\"? Or because he's so romantic that he managed to nickname her after the most stupid volatile on earth, a.k.a Pidgeon?    NO. Of course no.    Why would you want to lock yourself up in some scary relationship where in the end, you just lose everything; your independence, as well as your right to have a life that doesn't exclusively revolves around him? Why would you want to give up your liberty as an individual in order to be so tied up with your love interest that you can't even breathe on your own?    (And for those who pretendedly realized that it wasn't healthy, but yet managed to like the book anyway: why would you want to witness such a relationship? What's the pleasure in contemplating two people who never, ever realize how deep they've fallen into violence and abuse?)    I don't care whether Travis (supposedly) changes at the end of the book. I don't care for his pseudo redemption and/or efforts. What matters are the facts, here and now, that Abby acknowledges them while they're horrible and still manages to stay with Travis.    I couldn't finish the book because I was feeling sick to my stomach - and I insist on saying the characterization of the love story was awful and should never be seen as something okay. I have witnessed abusive relationships in real life; this book depicts the beginning of one, and the memories alone are enough to make me wanna throw up. I certainly won't force myself to undergo the whole 400 pages.    Besides, I read on some reviews that (spoilers):    * At some point he won't let her get out of the apartment because he thinks her clothes aren't appropriate enough. Therefore he forces her to change.  Okay. May I send you back to the \\"This is not okay behavior\\" part of the review?    * They get married at Las Vegas (at 19).    * That after him getting an \\"Abby\\" tattoo, she gets one too that reads \\"Mrs Maddox\\".    I'd like to talk about this for a second. I'm a firm believer that you can love someone in an unconditional way without having to show it with material proofs. Marriage and tattoos? What is this? Travis unexpectedly got an \\"Abby\\" tattoo, without warning her, without considering the consequences of such an act (but I guess I'm asking too much from him, considering he's got tribal tattoos all over his body).  Anyway, Travis emotionally challenged her, and so she got one too. Again, what is this? A leash that she will never, ever be able to free herself from? What if their relationship doesn't last? What if they get a divorce? Basically, until the day she dies, she will look at her skin and remember that at some point in her life, she chose to mark herself not as a person, but as a wife. As someone's something. And that's just terrible.    So. *Breathe*. In my humble opinion, I think it is better that I just don't finish it. Like, ever.    I'm writingall this because I feel so MAD about this book. Women fought and still fight every day so we can be treated as equals and not as objects. I'm not going to sit still and pretend this book didn't horrify me. Because it did. It really did, big time.    Also believe it or not but I'm not doing this to tear the author down, I don't really care about her, my review isn't about her but about the book. It's nothing personal, I respect her as a human being. I just feel very sorry for the messages she conveys through this everything but Beautiful Disaster.    (Yeah, so. About that. There seems to be some kind of Reviewers VS Authors movement. here on GoodReads (but also on Amazon, Twitter, etc.).  Since the author of Beautiful Disaster made me be a part of it, I believe you should read this : [...], and this : http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0JKL0SBZCSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466401885#wasThisHelpful)    Finally, last but not least. I feel like it's time to clarify some stuff.    If you disagree with this review, or if it made you angry, you should know that I don't care about, well, what you think. You knew it was a 1 star rating so basically, no one forced you to read but yourself. Get over it and move on. Simple as.    And I know I mentioned the 5 stars ratings girls and all, but really it was just semantics, don't feel like you should comment my review to express your disagreement or your undying love for Travis, because whatever you say, it won't change the way I feel. I don't even read the comments if they're like that. Unless it is interesting, of course. But if you're here to defend the psychopath and try to explain how in the end the relationship comes full circle, or why his unacceptable behavior is only masculine and protective, please SAVE YOUR TIME. (And mine).    Obviously, we won't get along and if you can't understand what I'm trying to say then it's fine, keep loving Eclipse and Blood Promise and Hush Hush, I mean, it's cool. Honestly, I'm serious, tastes and perceptions and ideals are all different and I don't have a say in this, and neither do you. So, well, you can just save your time with the comments. And back off already. Thank you.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I have not even gotten half way through the game and I'm stuck.  There is no help.  I would not buy!!!!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I REALLY like this album--very tasty stuff! But, I can't be the only one who, when I loaded it into Itunes and my Iphone, had it come out all in JAPANESE or CHINESE letters! Tell me it ain't so!! Or is it a \\"Joe Joke\\"?
0786956291|5.0|I have never played D&D before and this package really got me started! As soon as I got the package I ripped it open and started to read the Player's Handbook to see how I can make my character, and that's when I discovered that the path to creating your character is a complete solo adventure!!! It was confusing at first, but after I wrapped my head around what was going on I found it to be really exciting and pretty fun! Right now I've got My character all ready and I'm just dyeing to go into a real battle. I will most certainly continue with the D&D series! If you are a new comer to D&D I HIGHLY suggest that you get this kit!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|To begin with, everyone should remember that Harrison Ford movies are about having fun, and this movie about cowboys and aliens is no exception.  Cowboys and Aliens, Indeed.  What's not fun about<br />even the title of this film?  The action and special effects are really great!  As in most of Harrison Ford films, there is room for everything: romance, high drama, fighting aliens, spacecraft, Indians,<br />explosions and more.  And the entire story should be enjoyed as a fun experience, which it is!  I think that I enjoyed the hummingbird the most.  How could I not recommend this wonderful<br />adventure for everyone?  See it and have fun.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Its wonderful to be able to access my laptop from anywhere, but it's hard to use the gestures and mousepad mode without accidentally dimming in and out or moving the screens placement.  I wish they had a trackpad placed next to the screen preveiw, like the one from the RemoteDroid ap from the tootle play store for aneroid.  Still love it though!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|at first I thought this was fun untell half of my circle things were gone I have spent 1month to get as much as I had the bottom line is to safe your self from mad news and 1 dollar get the free one
0441020712|4.0|Even average Reynolds is better than 99.9% of the product of other authors.  Unfortunately, this book is \\"average\\" Reynolds.  Doesn't reach the heights of Chasm City or House of Suns but doesn't stink like Pushing Ice.  Alastair, for the love of all that is good, please redo the ending of the Revelation Space series!  Pleeeeease!  Maybe an ending akin to the medal ceremony at the end of Star Wars and then \\"happily ever after\\".
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game ilove it. everyone should try. it and there's no need to spend any money of your own the game always gives you what you need if you know how to get it!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|love this song! Downloaded this for my ringtone was super easy to get on my phone and use.  Will download from amazon again super easy.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It shocks me that a book that puts women in a sub-standard place, as sex slaves manipulated by the more powerful, dominant, successful male businessman. It is very telling that this book series is a nationwide best seller, confirming that women across the country acquiesce to a degenerative place as submissives and embracing a role to be used and abused. I cannot understand why anybody would read such trash - because I have always viewed women as equals - as partners, not as submissive sex toys to be used and abused.  If you think that women should be owned as property, or are less than men in all ways, then you will LOVE this book and series. If you think that women are equal to men and should be treated with respect, then I think you will not like this book at all. You may find it interesting to know that there are people out there that think this way, and to be on guard.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I am still reading this book. At the last of the book 5. I enjoy some parts and others are just to technical. Having problem keeping up with what is going on. But find myself wanting to get to the end so I can find out what happens to the main character.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so awesome. the first time I got the game I played it and I got up to level 10. its so easy to play
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was such a gripping story. Well written. I read it in a day! Couldn't put it down!! I HIGHLY recommend this book! Well worth the cost and more!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun i love getting all of the cool items that you can use in the game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game. it is sooo &agrave;ddicting!!! I just keep playing all the time. its very cute and fun. just fun for the whole family.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This was a great deal.  The entire series for under $50.  It is in an incredible amount of groundbreaking television for only a little more than you would pay for a single film from any of the big box stores.  If you are a fan of the Bundy family or simply love to hate them, you can't go wrong with this box set.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy Mr. Neeson. The movie itself is absolutely absurd. \\"Mr. Outdoors\\", played by Neeson made every wrong decision starting with his employment at the oil camp.<br />So many dreadful errors in judgements made me want to turn the movie off, as did the stereotyping of the differing characters, especially the former prison inmate.<br />I wont get into why there were shotgun shells found but no shotgun or how Mr. Neesons rifle was broken while it's case remained intact.<br />I wont go into detail as to why on earth they ever left the relative safe haven they could have made the remnants of the crashed aircraft into while awaiting rescue (there are two black boxes on such aircraft, all of them, that transmit signalling information for a very long time).<br />I wont go into detail about why Mr Neeson didnt die of hypothermia after his little river excursion late in the movie.<br />And I won't express my disgust with the ending of the movie.<br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than President Obama as I don't hate anyone else enough.<br />Poor movie with a great actor in it. That is as kind as I can be.
B003YOMN68|5.0|For jazz cognoscenti, this recording captures a seminal moment in the evolution of jazz, Bill Evans' career, and that of the subsequently legendary Scott Faro. You don't need to know the details to appreciate it. Your appreciation only can be enhanced once you hear the story and, even, read a poem inspired by the performance of \\"I Loves You, Porgy.\\" By all means, purchase this recording without reservation.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Heard all the buzz about this book so I purchased it. After reading 100 pages or so I'm over it. The story is weak and the only thing that holds it together at all is the sex. Not enough substance for me, in fact boring.
0240815807|5.0|This is the one book I recommend nowadays.<br /><br />It contains an incredible amount of top notch information and is the best ressource money can buy for producing great sounding records.
B007P06DJK|5.0|This product contains both a CD and a DVD. The DVD, \\"Under African Skies\\" is an inspiring film at the 25th anniversary of the recording of Graceland. It expands the depth of Paul Simon's genius. I have watched it twice and will watch it again. A fabulous deal!
B0086700CM|5.0|Ever since my friend down the street showed me this game down street showed me this game ive been an expert. I will take on anyone.
B007LB1O3I|3.0|Madonna has clearly lost her way. This album a long awaited one will surely disappoint long time fans who are used to sharper edgier music. Madonna has fallen pray to dance-pop in much the same way Usher has gone Euro-trance. Madonna's music has always been danceable but with a different edge. I was so excited to receive the CD as a gift but must confess that I am sorely disappointed. Madonna's last great album was her \\"Ray of Light\\" album with a mature sound and great production.<br /><br />This CD might as well be Ke$ha and Lady Gaga. Not sure who Madonna thinks this CD is for but I will say they are for those with an untrained ear and a short history of knowing Madonna's body of work.
B0011UBDTK|3.0|I was so excited when I bought this set years ago. The only complaint that I have is that there are 2-3 discs that don't work. One skips and the others just plain don't work. So keep that in mind when purchasing this particular set.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very good. works well. like the hints button.  no<br /><br />bugs.  ocassional ads.  enjoy playing the game to pass the time.  I would recommend it and the price was right.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Saw Gotye's Somebody...video a while back (before it got hyped everywhere) and was mesmerized by the song and the images - checked him out online and he sounded a very interesting musician so decided to get his Making Mirrors CD.  Am very glad I did.  Love the unique ecletic mix of songs - a very talented guy indeed!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is very entertaining and very fun! It works on my Android tablet and It has good graphics (i guess)..... Well, if you like solitaire, you will obviusly like this app.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|The moment I saw this boxed set available, I knew I had to have it. I've already seen the series on netflix, but I love expanding ym dvd collection when I can do it at a good price. The set may be a little bulky, but it looks great, and the cylon figure at the top of the package is just great. This would be a great gift come Christmas time, and and excellent addition to any sci-fi collection.
B007WCJSWA|5.0|To the casual listener, Mike Stern's latest CD \\"All Over the Place\\" may sound like familiar territory but if you listen closely you will hear brand new beauty, fire and magic.  For this offering, Mike Stern has assembled twenty-one highly talented musicians and the interplay between them is simply amazing. If you like artful improvisation performed by the crème de la crème in the Jazz music world and if you like Mr. Stern's ability to write highly evocative melodies, this CD is well worth your time and money.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|This is a free roaming game that is pop up central. The missions are repetitive and stupid. The controls are decent while websling but combat is is terrible. The only villians in the game are the lizard and some fat hipster guy. spiderman total mayhem is way better than this game. Get that if you need a spidery fix. This is not even close to a 5 star game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a good game, it helps pass the time when ur bored although it can get boring after a while.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the series. Read them all in one weekend. Just couldn't put them down. Now my husband wants to read them. Enjoy
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a addictive game that is so much fun! Soon this will be the best game! I rate i 1,000,000 stars out of 5!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|GOOD GRAPHICS. FREE ROAM. 25 MISSIONS. GREAT COMBAT. GREAT WEB SLINGING. YOU NAME IT THEY GOT IT KIND OF LIKE THE MOVIE
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever it is so addicting and fun to see all the animals you can get.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I thought this was a well-rounded analysis of the moral implications of consuming animal products.  Eating meat in and of itself isn't demonized, but the consequences of factory farming are clearly detailed.
B007SGM084|4.0|Not the deepest of books with regards to subject matter, but a great summer-time page turner.  The Kindle price could be a little lower, especially for the bundle.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game. It is my new addiction. Did not go to bed before midnight for weeks because could not stop. playing.
B008COD5OO|2.0|This movie failed to live up to all the hype and its delivery was sloppy. I knew what was coming as soon as the plot was laid out.  It was a far cry from the very humorous & iconic American Pies and Scary Movies I grew up with. This movie tried and failed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. its fun to play my kids also enjoy playing it. their is pop ups but all it takes is on click and its gone not that big of a deal
B001AQO3QA|5.0|one.of.the.best.blu-ray.collection.Ever and i would recommend this to all aliens lovers. A must buy for ridley scott fans. A worth it purchase
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great Bc I can sync my thoughgs to all my devices no matter where I am, easy to use and very useful.
B0027MJU00|1.0|I thought Gone Girl was fantastic. I literally couldn't put it down.  I haven't read Sharp Objects yet. I am not enjoying this book though. The story and the characters are repellent.  Libby Day is not a sympathetic protagonist. I'm having difficulty caring what happens to her.  The other characters I've encountered so far - Magda, Kassie (or was it Krissie?), Michelle, Trey, Diondra are creepy without being interesting.  I haven't finished it and don't know if I will.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game is very close to Alchemy in design.  Alchemy is free and has the same functionality, minus the extra graphics, and has been around for a couple of years now
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a great game especially on the kindle fire. good good good gooi i ! !!  ! !! ! ! !! !!
0307591549|5.0|While we are busy obsessing over unemployment, we are overlooking a question that impacts even more people: Why aren't more working people happy at their jobs? Shawn Achor has written a concise overview of the problem, the challenges, and the answers.  The possibility of joyful work in which we are attentive to ourselves, our employees, and each other may be the central issue for anyone--and especially young people-- coming into the workforce and recovering from the recession. Unless we know how to create meaningful careers we will never be able to motivate people to get the education they need and seek careers that will be satisfying. The happiness advantage offers a prescription for moving forward.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I keep thinking there's something wrong with me and my all-too-American tastes, because the genteel, veddy-veddy-British sensibilities of well-reviewed films like \\"Howard's End\\" and \\"Remains of the Day\\" and even \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" barely hold my interest. Sadly, \\"The Iron Lady\\" almost falls into the same category. Yes, Meryl Streep's performance is worthy of her Best Actress Oscar, but the writing and directing lack punch and focus. Without the gimmick of Thatcher's dead husband continually surfacing as an hallucination, the film would have little going for it beyond Streep's remarkable acting. Not to quibble (who am I kidding, it is a quibble), Streep's accent occasionally sounds like her Julia Childs impersonation. This is a film worth watching once, but perhaps not a keeper for your collection. And I KNOW the British can make dynamic, compelling, watchable films. See \\"Love, Actually,\\" any in the Harry Potter series, \\"The King's Speech\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\"
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is a lot to pay for but its worth it because its reaaly fun and entertaining. I would reccomend you getting this.
1609611543|5.0|This book along with the \\"Healthier without Wheat\\" book, have helped me to transform my diet and my life.  By eliminating wheat and wheat gluten from my diet, I am turning my health around; no more IBS.  There are so many health issues that can be directly linked to Wheat that everyone should read this book.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great book!  Can't wait until the next one comes out! It tore at my heart strings.  I recommend it for sure!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I really do not know what other people are complaining about with this item, I have an iPad 3 and the adapter worked flawlessly as soon as I plugged it in, and I didn't read the instructions...... It really is prett obvious how it works.......
B0034G4OY0|4.0|I really liked this movie. It's not a typical Matt Damon movie, but it is worth the time. You will enjoy this movie especially if you believe or are open to the possibility of the after life, clairvoyance, and things of that nature. I have watched this movie once and am sure I will watch it several more times. Worth your time!
B005MHSELS|5.0|[[ASIN:B0058YPG1G Breaking Bad: The Complete Fourth Season]]<br /><br />This is by far the BEST TV series and possibly the best show I've ever seen.  The writer is incredible, you can never guess what happens next.  The cast has all won Emmy's as well as the show. The cast is unbelievable. They all do an incredible job.  What more can I say?  Watch all 4 seasons, you will not be disappointed!  Season 5 starts around the 15th of July.
B0086700CM|4.0|Lots of fun to begin with, but it slowly becomes boring because the basic element is unchanging. I recommend the game though because it is entertaining for a moderate amount of time.
B0086700CM|3.0|time 2 time I always played temple run.but it got a little boring. Now it freezes.its still ok but really not the best.
B0086DBE62|1.0|The acting wasn't even mediocre.<br /><br />The humor wasn't humorous.<br /><br />The plot was a mishmash of disconnected images and a nonsensical script.<br /><br />The characters had no development, and their personalities were juvenile.<br /><br />It felt as though we were watching the Disney channel, only infinitely worse.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game keeps people entertained and interested in what comes next. You have to work for what games you want to play.
B0086700CM|5.0|I would actually give this a four and a half rate but I cant figure out how too. Nice game guys!!!!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is solid. Its heavy, well made and very durable. I wish the handle was not as slippery when hands are wet but that can be fixed with survival rope. Because the blade is so thick cutting small things is a bit awkward.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game! Its challenging and extremely fun!  I highly recommend it to those who love puzzle games. It is well worth the 99&cent;
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and have several on my tablet.  This is my favorite version. The tiles are easy to see and the various lay outs make this app challenging.  I`ve never had a problem with it.  The only improvement I could suggest would be the ability to change the tile color and pictures.  Great App!!!  (and no, I am not employed by or in anyway related to the creators)
B003EVWDR0|1.0|When I watched this movie, I thought it didn't have much of a story.  The special effects were good but not great - pretty simple!  After an hour of viewing the movie and having nothjing substantial develop, I gave up and turned it off.  I'm glad I checked the DVD out of the library for no cost and didn't waste any money at the movies or buying the DVD.  Although it received a lot of awards, most of the movies that receive awards are not that good.  It made a lot of money but not from me.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|I love Melody Gardot, but this album was a bit disapointing to me. It doesnt have her typical jazz sound that I love so much. I love to hear artists try something new, but this just fell flat to me. I also dislike that there is a 15 min gap before the hidden track. I tend to play my CD's in a continuous loop, and with that gap, its just annoying. But since this album wont be in my favorites pile, its not that huge of a deal.
1580815634|4.0|This is a very nice audiobook. It has the right balance of narration, sound effect, and dialog to hold your attention and to present the book as worthy literature. I understand that there are several versions of this book even by Wilde himself, some more controversial than others. This one, I am guessing, is fairly tame; I found nothing controversial in it. The several voice-actors are distinguishable and there is enough narration to understand the storyline. I recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was absolutely the best book I've read in a long time.  Look out Patterson!  There is new a sheriff in town.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really enjoyable book. Very well written. If you love fantasy, in particular the genre of heroic fantasy, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this book. For the low price it is definitely worth a gamble if you're unsure.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This little item is a God send when you want to play and not bother others who have no appreciation for your awesome shredding. LOL. I was amazed at the sound and the controls on this thing. It gets crazy loud and has wicked gain.<br /><br />Now this is not a tube amp and is not intended to serve as a amp for a show or recording but it has great sound. The controls are responsive and gain is enough for all your shred tricks and styles.<br /><br />I was worried about price for this little thing but after getting it, I could not be happier. I do not know why other companies are not doing these. I mean for a portable personal amp, it can't be beat. All the other ones are little cubes that require a lot of batteries and are large compared to these. To me it is a no brainer.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a personal amp for private practice or enjoyment, then get it. I am also getting the Vox Twin for a clean sound for practicing without gain or distortion. Well worth the money
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome game. The main character is so adorable. So many levels and it gets difficult. Great time killer! Can get frustrating but with practice, you will master it!
B005HSL626|2.0|I have app on kindle fire and works fine until I get multiple power slices in a row or one huge slice-- then it closes down on me--happens every time-- fix those glitches and I would give it a four star!
B004LWZW8I|3.0|The only appeal to this movie is the bloodshed if you're into that. The story is a complete distortion of Greek mythology and nothing more than a rehash of Conan the Barbarian and The Beastmaster with a somewhat different twist. But not enough of a twist to make it interesting. Watching it once was enough. Buying it...out of the question.
0345803485|1.0|I kept reading just hoping that I would get to something and it never happened. I CANT believe this is on the best sellers list. The author is laughing her way to the bank. Skip this read.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|My mother loved this movie. So I got this because of all the special features. She loves it. The case is also very nice looking. The blu ray quality is great.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I checked the kindle book out from my library (and that was after waiting 3 months on the waiting list-which I didn't particularly mind, since it is a bestseller and I'd heard that it was written by a Twilight fan). I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT. I feel so bad for everyone who wasted money on this series, as well as angry that so many people were scammed into buying because of the series' success. As a rule, I don't buy books if I've never read the author before.<br />Like so many other reviewers before me, I found this book reprehensible. It's easily the worst thing I've ever read, and possibly the worst ever penned. The plot (or lack thereof) is garbage. Even if it wasn't, it's so slow that I'd never be able to get into it. The characters are ridiculous. The sex scenes are...there are no words for how terrible and unbelievable those are. They're the worst I've ever read, and I've read a LOT of crappy smut. The writing itself is so bad that I almost wish I'd bought two copies of the physical book-one so that I could mark it up and edit it into something readable, then send it to the editor, and one to burn into ash, page by awful page.<br />I was so sure that this was written by a mentally challenged teenager that I Googled the author. She's nearly 50??????? What 50-year-old is a fan of the Twilight books (another series that never should have seen the light of day)??????? How is junk like this being published? Someone needs to put her in jail for the murders of fiction and the English language. How many times can anybody really read, \\"He cocked his head to one side,\\" \\"his eyes are so grey,\\" \\"he's so many shades of [insert cliched BS here]\\" before going out, buying a gun, and shooting themselves with it? I don't want to find out, which is why I WILL NOT be reading the rest of this series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a most challenging (and at times frustrating) game. However, it is quite fun, and both relaxing and mentally stimulating at the same time. As there is increasing evidence that we need to exercise our mind just as much as our body, l enjoy games such as these, as they are not mindless time wasters, but truly force you to use that brain of yours which is all to often engaged in non-productive coach potato activities.
0345803485|1.0|I was so curious about this book, just HAD to read it!  I had to laugh at myself for finishing it...kept hoping it would improve as it went along.<br />It was almost humorous due to the bad writing!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love how you can customize this app. I've never overslept. There are so many ways to set it up, but it is not complicated.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of games to play of varying difficulty.  Some vary easy and some not.  Overall it is a pretty good game to keep the kids occupied...of every age.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is great, not only does it allow you to choose your version of the Bible, but it also reads to you and allows you to be able to compare different versions of the text and read the asides while reading instead of scrolling to the bottom. Also, I have not taken advantage of this feature so I may be incorrect but I believe it allows you to set up a daily reading plan and will remind you at set times through the day what you're. supposed to read on that day.... its an all around very User friendly Bible app.
0345529057|4.0|I've only read the first two books in this series but I have to say that the prose is very well crafted and the story is engaging.  There are no completely uninteresting characters and the plot keeps you guessing.  That said this is a fantasy series not for everyone.  If you like political intrigue, plot twists, and good characters, you'll find this to be a good read.  In terms of prose, George R.R. Martin is superb.  I look forward to finishing this lengthy collection.
1469984202|5.0|I loved this series.  I must admit that I am generally not drawn to science fiction as a genre, but after reading the reviews (along with the cheap price tag!) I decided to purchase all five.<br /><br />I would love to see this series become a film.  It is a great post-apocoliptic read that, to me, is original and well written.<br /><br />Keep up the great work Hugh, I can't wait to read more!
B00846TTDG|5.0|GREAT movie. Acting was laughable at some times but then again, these boys are hard core bad a$$es not, pansy actors. The story line was pretty good and there was lots of good firepower flying down range taking out bad guys...whats not to like? In the end, you should walk away with a sense of what these guys do while most of the country sits behind the computer doing movie reviews....wait....HA! Great movie!! Bad **$*$ seals, lots of spent brass, lots of chichi's arriba bad guys. A++
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The collection looks great and includes the original theatrical and directors cut of all four Alien movies. Although most of the bonus material is really good (I liked the directors commentary on Alien that included both Ridlry Scott and the cast). Other bonus material--like screen shots of the script page-by-pave was a bit much. I would have liked to have seen more behind the scenes footage but I don't think that much was recorded at the time (80's/90's). All ina, the collections a real thrill and a lot of fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app!  I have had many Bible and study Bible apps, but this one is by far the best.  it has helped me stay consistent with my Bible study and gives me so many study options to personalize.
B005S0HNU2|1.0|I purchased season one, two and three and am disappointed I can't get season four because it will not play in the US.  I am hoping this will change and region 1 will be able to get it at a later date. I really have enjoyed the four seasons and look forward to a fifth.  I feel I have an incomplete set.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Is it true?  The greatest? Well Citizen Kane certainly has the greatest reputation of all time. Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. Much of this film's accolades came from the era when it was released. Upon release Citizen Kane was a new kind of epic. Orson Welles utilized innovative cinematography techniques, music, and narrative structure to present this cinematic experience.  These innovations went on to affect every element of the film making industry. It is truly is a movie on a huge grand scale.  It's deep and it follows the entire life of a man. Citizen Kane is a fictional portrait of a famous American.  The famous main character is Charles Foster Kane who was played by Orson Welles. Kane is an immensely wealthy man that builds an empire.  He has everything yet he is only human.  He struggles with relationships, fame, responsibly, and emotion just like everyone else. The film explores many issues all humans experience in life. It is full of interesting quotes and could spur many philosophical conversations. Throughout the course of the film you really get a feel for what this characters life was like. Citizen Kane is a very thoughtful and meditative piece. You may not think it is the best movie of all time, but when you watch it you might wonder: could it be?  That alone is worth the price of admission many times over.
8866131385|3.0|I have the 2011-2012 planner and I love the monthly calendar in the beginning pages of it. However for some reason moleskine decided to change this nice feature into lines instead of boxes! Being a visual person it's harder for me to envision the months and do planning with this kind of format plus I use the boxes to put those stickers that comes with the planner! Guess I'll just have to physically cut the calendars from my old one and paste it to the new one. they should have eliminated the travels memo, time tables and flight durations pages so I can have my box month calendar :(  despite this missing feature overall a great buy!
B007NESBK2|5.0|I have all of Sade's \\"Live\\" recordings and this tops them all!!<br />Sade not only sings better but she looks better than ever.<br />The band that comprises Sade are extremly tight -knit and are fabulious!!! (Most of them have been together for decades)<br />The video effects are outstanding and add to the performance!!<br />One song in particular, has the sun rising and setting behind Sade while she sings.  Breathtaking!!!<br />If you are a lover of Sade, like I am, you must have this DVD. (Blue-Ray if possible)
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Victor Cheng is top-notch teacher and career coach who breaks down the long climb into the management consulting industry into manageable pieces in colloquial, comfortable language. This is a fantastic resource for all inspiring consultants (I'm not a consultant yet but am tearing through Victor's material).
0060723513|5.0|A friend of mine loaned me her copy of this book.  When I finished I knew I had to have my own copy.  Sometimes you just HAVE to own a copy.  This is one of those books.  I have not been so moved since I read The Shack.  Her journey is beautiful and her telling of it brilliant.  Inspirational.  Moving.  This is a book I will read more than once!
B00009L1TA|5.0|Received on time and in new condition watched as soon as I received. I have wanted for a long time and found it at bargan basement price. Loving it.
B0024CEY36|2.0|The plot of the story had the potential for intrigue, all the elements were in place,but the story was clumsy and predictable.  I did like the history unfolding prior to WWI and the integrating of the future leaders of Great Britian into the converstions.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app great! It has different types of games that are fun and addicting. Also it has cool graphics and easy to earn more points for more games.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|While Young once maintained it is better to burn out than it is to rust, this CD begs the question. If rusting means not releasing this mix of unlistenable versions of traditional songs, then go for the rust.  Or maybe this CD is a sypmtom of being burned out.  Whatever.  Oh,Susannah?  Really?  If you want to hear Young and Crazy Horse at their ragged best, without going back to the '70's, get 1990's \\"Ragged Glory\\".  That CD has great original tunes with bad-ass singing and playing to match.  Young would have been better served to go on the cancelled Buffalo Springfield reunion tour and release a live version of that, knowing that the studio wizards could clean up any \\"messes\\" left by Young, Stills, and Furay.  This is just an embarrassment to a long and distinquished career.  If an unknown band put this out they would be torn to shreds by you listeners and by critics.  In line with the Americana theme, as Jed Clampett might have said, \\"Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful.\\"
0345803485|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS SERIES, IT WAS A GREAT READ. THE AUTHOR CAPTURED MY ATTENTION WITH THE EROTIC STORY LINE..I CAN'T WAIT TILL THEY MAKE THE MOVIE :)
B007SGM084|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is not my normal reading genre. I started reading it on a recommendation from a friend. Once I started reading I could not put the book down...it literally drew me in. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Once you got past the first half of the Fifty Shades of Grey book, the true romantic plot began to unfold. A definite must read for those who want a compelling love story.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|so I originally got Doodle God free which made me mad cause I couldn't play the whole thing through but I bought the full version and love it sooooooooooooo much this is the greatest game ever people true me
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple but with just enough extras.  My favorite thing about it is the text is so large I don't even need to wear my glasses.
B0002HZHXG|4.0|A realistic fun addition to my grandson's plow and dump truck.  Seems durable.  I can't remember for sure, but I think we added some sticky velco to the back of the light bar and to the roofs of the trucks so that way he can move it to different trucks.  Most younger kids up to age 8 would need help changing the colored plastic light covers for the different effects they are a bit difficult to change.  The sounds are realistic and not too loud to be annoying.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|it is super awesome you get to roam around the city and fight badguys and do amazing stuff and I love spiderman more then anyone this is the best game in the appstore and if you buy it I hope you enjoy it
B003297I1U|5.0|A very durable, workable, and realistic toy. Our 7 year of age grandson plays with this almost daily.  With proper supervision to not be destructive the crane continues to provide much enjoyment and realistic play.  A great toy that is durable and well worth it.  A toy that will be passed down to other grand children and with the proper care can be around for a very long time.<br />I love the Bruder toys they really take the play and look so realistic.
0345803485|1.0|Wish I did not waste my money on this book, if u are truly a reader then from the very first page you will not like it.  Its repetitive and seriously a waste of my eye sight,  so many other things wrong with this book highly annoyed i purchased it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|O livro é bem interessante e o inglês é simples, sem grandes mistérios. Recomendo a leitura antes do filme (que não sei ao certo quando estréia).
B005R32L66|5.0|I was extremely surprised at how beautiful the product was when I received the item and could not wait to show off the cover to my co-workers the next day.
0547569653|5.0|I bought this book when Scott came to speak at our local running store.<br /><br />During his talk, he was down to earth and surprisingly funny. I noticed how he was especially kind and compassionate to geeky teenagers and children. I knew ahead of time that Jurek's mother had passed away from a chronic disease - but that's about it. Reading the book and learning about his suffering in childhood, watching his mother wilt away, and having to bear the bulk of the responsibility for chores and his father's temper as the oldest of three, I understood where Jurek began to develop his iron will and compassion for others.<br /><br />The book is informative regarding vegan lifestyles w/o being preachy. Jurek's enthusiasim for ultra running and a healthly lifestyle shines through and is infectious. I had no idea he was into Buddhism or Existental schools of thought. His writing is not pretentious - he drops some serious philosophy on one page and then will tell a funny story about his 'nuts' being crushed by the seat of a crappy bike on a long ride on the next page. Jurek also describes some hilarious antics of his long time friend, Dusty - who seems to be the anti-Jurek in every way.<br /><br />The recipes are good. I'm not much of a cook, but I may attempt some of the less labor intesive ones. A friend tried the tempeh recipe and raved about it.<br /><br />I will keep this book on my things to read the night before a big race rotation. Simply Solid.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game,  I play it all the time when I need to pass these time waiting or when I need a break from studying
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game whenever I have my kindle.  charged so addicting you will love it I reallly would encourage everyone of my friends to get this game. it is so much fun!
630522577X|5.0|When viewing on the video sign kept coming up showing clean disc.  Tried 5 times and same reply showed.  Tried on another player and the same thing happened.  It was very frustrating.  It seemed the video was sent from other than Amazon.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app I have it on my kindle fire and it looks awesome and the game is oust addicting and I like that u have to unlock the things and it makes u want to play more.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|After the dissapointing M2M AND ATS i was worried about the new cd but soon as i heard track 1s banging electro synths and chester screaming and mike rapping his ass off i could tell this cd is different.  Im not going through song by song like other reviews but i just want to say this is their first cd in their last 3 cds u can tell they actually took their time.  Its like every nuance and every instrument compliments the song perfectly.  When the guitars kick in its not to be heavy or nu metal its too drive home the melody and point of the song.  This cd is simply amazing i bought it 2 days early for 16 dollars and am not dissapointed.  Only songs on cd i dont even say i dislike because i like them but are weird are the folksy singing after the heavy hip hop break beat on UNTIL IT BREAKS.  Every other song is def listenable.  Top 5 songs.  1. LOST IN THE ECHO.  2. Victimized.  3.  Break it down.  4. Powerless. 5.  Ill be gone.  But that doesnt do it justice because every song is a unique experience.  Thank u LP for finally making fans who hated ur last 2 cds see what ur true vison was
034580404X|5.0|The books were excellent. Have read they all..Thank yo for having The books all in one trilogy together, it made it very easy to read and keep together
0812993292|5.0|This book just grabbed me and pulled me in, from the first chapter.  I loved it!<br /><br />Harold Fry and his wife Maureen obviously have a troubled marriage.  They don't fight...they simply avoid each other.  The reader gets the immediate impression that there is much that needs to be said, that should be said, if only they'd REALLY talk to each other.  There are also allusions to a tragic past.  I was intrigued by the mystery and had to keep reading to find out what happened.<br /><br />Harold gets a letter from a woman named Queenie who he hasn't seen in 20 years.  She is dying and wanted to say goodbye.  Harold writes a letter in return, but it doesn't seem like enough.  He leaves his house to post the letter and just keeps walking.  He decides to walk 600 miles to say goodbye to her in person, believing that his journey will help her to live longer.<br /><br />Throughout his journey, the reader finds out the truth about what happened so many years ago to Harold and Maureen - from both his and her perspective.  Both husband and wife learn a lot from Harold's walk.  It is mysterious at first, then heartbreaking, and then hopeful once again.  It was like watching a family fall apart and slowly come back together again.<br /><br />The marketing for this book says that those who enjoyed \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand\\" will also enjoy this book, and I agree with that.  In fact, I enjoyed this book even more!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It has great performances from both Hopkins and Gosling. In my opinion it was well written, and it keeps you guessing about who will outwit who in the end. I highly recommend this film. It is a must see!
B004I744AS|5.0|my first review for an app for the kindle fire. I felt inspired to write one because this app provides the functions expected from a dictionary with no fuss or ads (or the ads must be so unobstrusive that I have not noticed them). great resource to have on hand!
B0000019PA|5.0|This album is an experience in itself. This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review for any album, and I am a music lover to the core. This album, when listened to as a whole, takes you on an unexpected trip. It grabs hold of you, holds on tight, then loose, then tight, then throws you, grabs you up again and then lets you go. This will bring out emotions in you that you didn't think music was capable of.<br /><br />It is full of beauty, sadness, chaos, tranquility, hope, and happiness.<br /><br />This album amazes me because for the first time, I am unable to explain in words why I love each song - the emotions the songs evoke are explanation enough.<br /><br />Probably not a delight for everyone, because this album FORCES you to feel. You have no choice. This might be a long-shot, but if I meet someone who does not get some sort of strong reaction from this album....I will probably not trust them!<br /><br />Just listen. Your life will be different, I promise.
B007NYPWS6|1.0|This POS was not worthy of taking up digital storage...this movie single handily made me hate Jodie Foster as an actress...I really had to see how much torture I could withstand not to just hit eject and get it the hell out of our home asap...anybody who thinks a single second of this was remotely funny needs to recheck their entire existence..
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Fiona's last two albums and have eagerly awaited this one...which has disappointed me greatly :( The music has a distinctly \\"fresh from the garage\\" echo, which tends not to mesh well with the overly clean vocal tracks overlay. The lyrics themselves are for individual preference, but again - we get it Fiona; somewhere, somehow a male hurt your feelings. The topic continues to repeat itself, much like a rapper reminding a listener of how much money he is currently making/holding/wearing etc.<br /><br />Apple fans (including myself for the most part) are a mildly fanatical lot, and it pains me to type this review. I expect to have rebuttals posted with the tired defensive lines of \\"you obviously aren't a REAL FA fan\\" or \\"you just don't get her music\\" - However, bear in mind that from *my* point of view, this latest release was of such mediocre quality that I felt obligated to come create a review so folks could consider spending their money elsewhere.<br /><br />I certainly wish someone had penned this before I had...
B000268RMU|5.0|Whether you're a fan or fanatical or none of the above for the movie \\"Kill Bill Vol. 2,\\" this eclectic mix of word and music is sure to satisfy even the pickiest music critic. Like Quetin Tarentino's body of work, this CD mixes new and old, general and cultural, under and over stated. For fans and extremists, the CD includes The Brides fight song, the story of Pei Magh, and the \\"Kill Bill\\" speech from The Bride from the beginning of the movie. If you love the movies, you will want this soundtrack along with Vol. 1's soundtrack.[[ASIN:B0000C9V3T Kill Bill: Volume 1]]
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is very fast -paced,  never ending and full of new things around every corner!  I love this! I would most definitely reccomend this game if you have great hand eye coordination :) excellent graphics,  too!  downloading this app will not waste your time!
140053271X|3.0|Two points only:<br />1) The ereader device is wonderful<br />2) DO NOT purchase ebooks from B&N as they contain additional security restrictions that make it extremely difficult / not possible to compile into Adobe Digital Edition for transfer to other ereader devices.  This is not true for ebook stores such as the Sony ebook store.
B00881VLCE|3.0|So this will stop asking me to rate it. Here's a rating now stop bugging me about it. Game is alright but its annoying that the whole puzzle moves when you try to grab a piece under the restore it.

1610660242|3.0|I just finished listening to the audio book and it was an ok experience.  The main reason I made it to the end was the audio-voice was a very nice soothing slightly-japanese american voice.  It was intresting to learn about Hsieh's (Shay's) history in business but he weaves in this glamorous stuff about how Red Bull has been his friend, the rave scene and how many good business decisions came while drinking at a bar.  This self-centered nature is expected from the start when Hsieh mentions he would rather not use a ghost writer or another voice to tell his story and proceeds to say that he likes the idea because he will get back at his stubborn English teachers from High School.<br /><br />When the book isn't following Hseih's parties, bar time, and self-centered stories it follows Zappos and the way they have built strong company culture.  The last third of the book he final drops most of the personal narrative and really lets us in on Zappos, I think it's an amazing company to have made it so well on customers happiness.  The company culture is amazing but it's a very hard stunt to pull with growth this has made Zappos an amazing company in my mind.  I like many of the ideas that Hseih touches upon from, transparency across the company to capitalizing on customer service. The final pieces of the book are centered on purpose and what brings happiness, ask yourself what are your goals?, get the answer then ask why? answer that the ask Why?....eventually if you ask why enough you should arrive at a belief that it will make you happy, if not you should change the goal...<br /><br />Ultimately I thought the book was an OK book, I feel a more fitting title would be \\"Hseih-nanagins to Zappos profitability and happiness.\\"  My analysis is that Zappos has risen with the customer in mind while everyone else has cut-out or outsourced customer service.  Old-fashioned customer service is long gone from so many businesses but it leaves an open field for new businesses to come into markets like Southwest has capitalized on all the other major airlines dropping their quality of customer service.to markets like Southwest has capitalized on all the other major airlines dropping their quality of customer service.

B007U1FEJE|3.0|I'm a recent Beach Boy fan, more of a Brian Wilson fan in truth.  We saw them perform this new album in concert a few weeks ago and enjoyed it very much.  This is a very schmaltzy album, what I would call easy listening - something I imagine my dad enjoying perhaps more than I would.  It's a bit too bland and sentimental, but given their age and history, credit for some really beautiful harmonies and some strong tunes.  Stand outs are Shelter and Beaches in Mind.
0761169253|2.0|Mediocre summaries of some decent advice.  Nothing that particularly stands out or is memorable.  Might be good for a high school student

0439023491|5.0|I found this second book of the trilogy more interesting and satisfying in a lot of ways. It continues in a blend of several genres with elements of science fiction, fantasy and futurism. The writing style along with the plot has gathered more momentum. The basic elements of the plot remain the same: Katniss against the Capitol. Katniss has an energizing and intersting personality  and her facility with a bow and arrow makes her a female Robin Hood of this strange reality she inhabits. There is more intrigue and more plot twists in this volume. The Capitol ramps up its efforts against its citizenry and all the odds seem stacked against Katniss, Prim, her mother, Gale, Peta and the others. There are casualties and mishaps galore in the struggle which is difficult to describe without giving away important elements of the plot. The mysterious District 13 makes a reappearance but its complete significance is not revealed. This situation of course leads one into the last volume. Read it!<br />[[ASIN:B005DI4906 Selected-The Strange Story of Captain Jennings]]

B000CDO330|2.0|I have quite a few Schleich toys, and I've always been happy with them. So much better than other companies, always life like and durable. But I'm not happy with this giraffe. The paint job does not look realistic. There are many spots where it looks like someone was trying to make corrections to the paint - just horrible. Almost as if they had given a marker to a child and said, 'here, draw in some lines'<br /><br />What I find most confusing is the fact that all the Schleich toys I've purchased in the US are made in China. Schleich is a German company and all the toys I've bought in Germany are actually made there. So maybe it's the ones made in China that have more flaws, but then again, I'm very happy with my tiger, elephant and camel - all made in China. So I'm not sure what happened to this Giraffe, which I did buy as 'brand-new'
0226264211|5.0|Whatever position you may take on the systems of free enterprise and capitalism, this is an articulate defense of a (as Milton Friedman puts it) liberal view of modern socio-economic relationships. I disagree with about 90% of the claims that Friedman makes. However, this disagreement does not stop me from admiring the methodical, logically coherent approach Friedman brings to the argument. I would highly recommend this as a resource for understanding the notion of an uninhibited free market system.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I play tons of tower defense and vs games....this is by far one of the best. graphics are beautiful and the sound effects are not offensive after hours of playing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was surprised that the book was better than the review.  I totally enjoyed the characters, the story, the WORLD that was created.  Not what I expected, could not put my kindle down.  Each book drew me in more and more, I totally wanted to know what was going to happen at the end.  Even know, there is room for another book or two.  Really good job.

B0088RQ4X4|1.0|A very bad screenplay adaptation of the novel.<br /><br />A very bad movie in general.<br /><br />pro:<br />- Effects are generally good, except for the main Mars alien face designs which look cartoony in an otherwise realistic world.<br /><br />con:<br />- Poor overblown acting once the story gets to mars... which is 95% of the film.<br />- EXTREMELY bad script with non-stop unlikely plot driven coincidences.  Nothing that happens in the film naturally 'leads' to anything else-- plot events just happen one after another strung together by impossible coincidences.<br />- Bad TV style editing and camera angles.<br />- Relentless BG soundtrack, which is so overblown that it becomes distracting.<br />- Also surprisingly BORING since the viewer doesn't care about the characters or what is going on despite all the ridiculous cartoony action, which is a killer for a movie of this length.<br />-story summary: Bad guy is bad, good guy is good, there is no character development.  Everyone in the movie takes a turn at beating up the good guy like a roadrunner cartoon-- this is supposed to generate sympathy for his plight/struggle-- but since the good guy is obviously invincible it doesn't matter.  And on Mars a giant mars-frog-dog runs in super-sonically and licks the good guy's face after each time he gets beat up-- which is supposed to be funny.  Eventually people stop beating up the good guy, good guy falls in love with the cute Mars Princess after about three days and marries her, and the bad guy dies.  Good guy accidentally teleports back to Earth, spends the next 10 years becoming a billionaire and trying to teleport back to Mars, which takes about 5 minutes of screen time-- he succeeds.  THE END.<br /><br />point of movie: none<br />action/excitement: brainless adult or 5 year olds and under<br />buy/rent/skip: skip<br />additional notes: do not listen to your friends with kids who tell you what a 'great' movie this is. . .<br /><br />I love sci-fi action movies. . . but this one is pure refined big-budget garbage.  I'd call it a polished turd, but that would be an insult to turds.

B005LAIGSC|5.0|Look at the cast!  We knew we would be purchasing this one as soon as we left the theatre.  Denzel Washington is, as usual, phenomenal.  Ryan Reynolds is a fantastic young talent.  This was a wonderful action ride with substance as we get to see the two characters evolve into something more than they were as the story begins.  It is a story of strength, growth, and redemption.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyable and quick read; I connected with the characters and fell in love all over again with a man who makes me his priority. The physicality of the novel is intense, but not as intense or captivating as the character development and mystery that is Christian Gray. Grab a drink, relax by the pool, on the deck or in the privacy of your own bedroom; blush if you must, but enjoy the journey.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game ... entertaining.  kids enjoy playing this game. also it is free! can not beat the deal!<br /><br />just watch your time...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would have given 5 stars. Have played the game for about 5 weeks without a problem until today. A video ad with sound took over the entire screen. The game is addictive the ad was extremely annoying but the game was also free!
B00884GR0W|4.0|its rally fun but i dont know how to craft items or seperate them to put one plank in one spot and another in another spot someone please tell me what to i click for that
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like it.  its awesome and it works on the kindle fire great. it helps me a lot. and plus its not slow like all the others
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|how a blu-ray combo pack should look. outstanding!  10 out of 10 for the movie. thrilling and a great movie for anyone that enjoys cinema
034580404X|5.0|These set of books are very excitng and interesting to read. Thet keep you wanting to read moe and more.
B006MVJ2L4|1.0|Every song is very similar to each other and Lambert's voice is too thin to my taste. Also I was expecting a rock album, not as pop as this one.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Serious Beach Boys fans will love That's Why God Made the Radio.  The songs, themes, harmonies, and music are vintage Beach Boys.  If you haven't bought this CD or downloaded the MP3, DO IT NOW.  It will be the best $10 you will ever spend.  You will soon catch yourself singing along to Shelter, Isn't It Time, Spring Vacation, the album's title song, and some of the other cuts.  One word - outstanding!
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I loved this movie.  How much fun it was with the incredible CIG and nonstop action.  Holly wow.  Very cool.  I am a proud bluray owner of this awesome one.
B005LFQRTC|2.0|This set somes with 2 or 3 2hr pilot episodes that I'd never seen before. They obvisouly hadn't figured out this character's style at that time because he wasn't the same at all in later years.  In these early episodes they were going for an angry rebel against anybody in authority, and a James Bond type with the ladies, which Lee Majors just isn't, by any stretch. And the opening sequences to those pilot movies are just awful! Haha! The ultimate in 70's cheese- not the same title sequence we all know.<br />Throughout the entire season there are no sound effects when \\"Steve\\" uses his bionic abilities. Hard to believe how much the sound effect sells that, but without it it's just dead boring.<br />What surprised me the most watching this is that I absolutely loved this show as a kid.  The episodes are very, very long with great spans of time between action sequences, of which there may only be a couple in an entire episode. I can't believe I watched these entire things back then without falling asleep. I'm glad it made so many of us kids in the 70's so happy, but this is one series (and season) I will not be continuing to watch.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I just finished seeing Ben Howard at this year's Bonnaroo and he was definitely in the top 5 \\"must see\\" live acts of the festival. I was a little afraid that his unique falsetto-ish voice wouldn't translate very well in-studio so I was a touch apprehensive about ordering the CD. I couldn't be more wrong. Obviously the lead track \\"Old Pine\\" is going to grip your senses right off the bat, but virtually every track on this album takes you back to all those peaceful places in your past that were once forgotten but now remembered. And Ben's emotionally evoking words and style are a constant reminder of why we should never want to forget. If you're the consummate fan of the singer songwriter types, then Kingdom is a must add to your collection. And if given the opportunity, don't pass on seeing this guy play live!<br /><br />Sidebar - The only disappointment about the CD, no words. Not a huge deal, but just want everyone to know that you'll have to play the lookup game on the internet.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I cannot understand how a new author becomes famous overnight with such a badly written, drawn out saga of the same repeated over & over. I deleted the book just past halfway as I realized I'd already read everything in the 1st 5 chapters. For me as a male, dull and predictable. What concerns me most is the image many young readers may have of sex without love or relationship. Thankfully there are plenty of good reads out there. This one gets a ZERO!!! Happily married for 42 years.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is super fun and totally addicting. It's the perfect entertainment for long trips or just when you have some time to kill.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so awesome my mom paid 99 cents for it and it is a great game. you have so many levels and there is a lollypop on the rope so you cut the rope. it is cool and I really just love it.
B001M3PQGM|4.0|This movie was terrific. I showed it to my 6th graders. They compared this movie to what we had learned about the Middle Ages. A few thought it would be stupid but by the end all of my students were hooked.
B0086700CM|5.0|Everybody keeps on giving it a bad review just because its not working on there thing a majig but it is a really fun game it works great on my kindle fire so I.love it and I will keep on playing it until I turn 17
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome!!! very addictive! hope they come out with a sequel. I love this game!!! well going to play it
1416972250|5.0|By far my favorite YA series! Loved every book and have just started the next series by Cassandra Clare. Suitable for almost any age. The characters are relatable as well as likable. A definite summer read for any looking.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's about an abusive relationship, There is nothing great about it. It is dysfunctional.<br /><br />The writing is juvenile, dreadfully repetitious - buy a thesaurus and use it, author! And the setting is inaccurate.<br />No one needs to gasp, blush, or chew lip that many times.<br /><br />It's worthless. Don't waste your time, money, or brain cells.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I absolutely loved this series up until this final book. It really left a bad taste in my mouth and left me feeling like it wasn't over. There are far too many unanswered questions and an uncompleted ending. While I did find some of the story line enjoyable, it simply wasn't enough.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|My son had this one on his Kindle Fire and I tried it out and was instantly hooked!  I had to immediately find and purchase it on Amazon app store for my Vizio Tablet.  I have played it almost exclusively and managed to finish almost the whole game in  the time I've had it.  Truly addicting!
B000I3PERS|5.0|Though far from historically accurate, it is close enough to convey the struggle between those that wish to rule and those that wish to be free.  The story is superb, as is the acting of those who tell it.  In my humble opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is a spectacluar game and I find it very amusing and I tingle every time I fall of the trail hoo rah for this game
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was just...<br /><br />There was so much repetition, THIS IS NOT A DAMN POEM! WE DONT NEED THAT MUCH REPETITION!<br /><br />This book - I just can't.<br /><br />I've read better smut than this - I can probably write better smut than this.<br /><br />The Characters annoy me.<br />I hate the \\"inner Goddess.\\"<br />I take a shot every time she says  \\"Oh\\"<br /><br />Just - what even?<br /><br />Don't waist your time or money on this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is just fun<br />brings back memory's<br />intro is a little long but helpful<br />be nice if got more energy
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I got the Kindle Fire for our 4 grandchildren and for my husband and they all LOVE! LOVE! the Kindle Fire.<br />They watch movies , play games, read books, listen to music. It is the best gift ever!!!!!!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|been playing this for over a month now and i enjoy it.<br />Graphics are simple and clean which is GOOD! Control layout is good. Courses are a crazy. Can't think of anything bad about the game.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is a read for every person who may wonder why some people lead \\"charmed\\"lives and most of us don't. It explains in well written and easy to read detail that is the hard work, opportunities seized, and belief in the unknown future that makes greatness, if not in ourselves, then in our children. A must read for all those who don't understand the wisdom of hard work being it's own reward, not handing things to people and expecting the same appreciation.
B000TENEOG|5.0|This was the first of Jesse Cook's albums I bought, and now, about six albums later, it is still one I love.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a live performance, and you have the annoying people clapping and cheering coming out of your speakers and interrupting the music every now and then, some people don't like that, and typically I would agree with them - but this album makes an exception to the rule. This is one of the best albums of music I have heard. It is a concert, so it all flows together, there aren't it's not just a collection of songs, but a flowing piece, which in itself makes this album unique, but along with the incredible talent that makes appearances in this performance makes it remarkable.<br /><br />Blending mid-eastern, Spanish, African, and who knows how many other musical styles together, Cook and friends have developed a style that is fast, vibrant and all their own. Some of the tracks that stick out in my mind are \\"Luna Llena\\" This recording has some of Chris Church's best work on violin, \\"Tempest\\" which is expanded with Nicolas Hernandez performing with Jesse, and \\"Mario Takes A Walk\\" with the Samba Squad (who bring an amazing amount of energy to the piece.) \\"Fall At Your Feet\\" rightly concludes the album, delivering a fine performance from all.<br /><br />Despite the crowd in the CD, you will be hard pressed to find a better collection of these beautiful pieces of music, so if you're a fan of live performances, then this is for you, a fan of Jesse Cook - you're good to go, or a  fan of fantastic music that is not afraid to explore: look no further.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great buy and it came before time.  It was a used dvd but we couldn't tell because the packaging looked new and the dvd did also!
B0074EIQUG|5.0|Locked Down and the rest of this is a testament to Dr. John's awesomeness.  All the elements of New Orleans music meld in such a way to make the tradition seems as alive as vibrant as music can be. Time to go back to New Orleans and listen to music to my ears bleed.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I wanting to buy this movie and it finally was available for purchase I knew I had to get it.Movie made me and friends laugh hard. I give it five stars
1444737090|5.0|I found this book from U tube. Bob caught my eyes because I thought it was unbelievable that a cat does like that in front of many strange people on the very busy street with a guy who looked like a homeless?  I also thought that Bob was a very charming cat. Then I found another VCR from U tube that they are on the TV show.  It was very interested so I down loaded the book.  The book was unexpectedly good. It was very heartwarming and  honest  and brought me tears . The difficulty of their life on the street made the bond between James and Bob so strong.  I think that James was rewarded by doing good things to an animal and actually he was saved by bob which he saved. They needed each other and they believed each other. As a result, they could found a hope on the street together.  Bob is a really talented cute cat!  Also, I liked that he was taking about NEKO (Cat in Japanese) since it made me great smile ;) (I am from Japan).  It is based on true story and through this book, we can say that animals can make people to have better life. It is an awesome book!  I really enjoyed reading this book but felt disappointed when I reached last page of the book.  I hope that after a couple of years, James will publish second version of the book to tell us what's going on their life after the success on the street.  I truly hope that this book sells well and James and Bob have a long happy life together. Best wishes for James and Bob!
0385333846|4.0|Love this line...\\"The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty.\\"...<br /><br />Describing the aftermath of a car crash...\\"...the rear end of the Cadillac was a body-and-fender man's wet dream.\\"<br /><br />The novel as a whole, to me, was the perfect description of PTSD. Reminded me of when my husband, a therapist, worked with a Vietnam Vet and he finally got him to talk about things that happened to him through regression therapy, but found himself up against the wall with an arm cutting off his trachea until he finally could calm the guy down.<br /><br />War is hell.<br /><br />And it continues to be hell.<br /><br />Long after the war is over.<br /><br />Amen.
B000000W94|4.0|I usually cannot stand tribute albums since they very rarily achieve the same greatness as the original artist did with the same song. However, on this album, Gary Moore does a superb job of replicating Peter Green's guitar style and technique on these Fleetwood Mac cover songs. Being able to duplicate the great Peter Green cannot be easy. I am sure that not many guitarists could match Green's emotion, technique and tone. The drummer and bass player on this album, Graham Walker and Andy Pyle, also did an impeccable job of replicating Mick Fleetwood and John McVie from the original albums.<br /><br />The sound quality on this album is much better than the original Fleetwood Mac albums. This would be another reason to listen to this album.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about this album is that Gary Moore is using Peter Green's original guitar, the '59 Gibson Les Paul, on this album. Peter Green basically gave the guitar to Gary Moore during Green's dark period.<br /><br />This album is not for everyone and I still recommend for anyone who is interested in these songs nto go back to the original versions from Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac - these versions were the master pieces and purer in form.
B000OIBY4Y|4.0|This is a slim novel, a very fast read. You can't help but be affected by the circumstances in which Monsieur Meursault finds himself in. The novel tackles plenty of issues, including morals, judgment, and even the death penalty.<br /><br />I read Matthew Ward's translation from the French, and he had some interesting notes and tidbits to share. Like Camus deliberately used short sentences and brief descriptions, imitating some of the other popular (American) writers at that time.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is one of those must read books. If you haven't yet read this book, and you enjoy reading epic fantasy novels, then go no further! This books will have you engrossed for at least a few hours, most likely more.<br /><br />Looking forward with great anticipation to the second book!
0307949486|4.0|I'm enjoying the leisurely pace and the investigative detail of the book.<br /><br />So many of the cities and locations are foreign to me, though, not knowing Sweden at all! So it's nice to learn about it a little bit.<br /><br />It's really a timely critique of financial journalists and the financial world, as well, as our protagonist is a financial journalist and so it's interesting to get that perspective, as well, from Sweden, especially considering the state of economics in the US, and the world in general.<br /><br />I found the start of the book slow-paced, the middle of the book grows increasingly more urgent (I changed my rating of the book from 3 to 4 stars after reaching the midway point), and there is a second climax. I'd say a fantastic read. Interesting characters and a mystery that really draws you in and captures your imagination and the reveal is beyond what you imagined.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very many features, easy to use. The reading plans are very helpful and makes it helpfulto stay on track with my daily reading.
0545128285|3.0|Fun blast into the fairy tale world of wizard children. Nice to see some interesting facts and opinions from Dumbledore. Fun and interesting. My favorite story was the enchanted water with the witches & the knight.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I am a bit surprised by the quality of this video. For the price I paid it is truly a rare bargin. I followed the level 1 first then moved on as I got stronger.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|My first impressions were that this would be a blockbuster and solid movie. I was wrong. It was okay. There should have been more direct fighting between Kronos and Zeus/Hades. Perseus basically flies on a horse with wings, throws the spear into the depths of Kronos and the movie is basically over at that point. Zeus has no strength left and dies. Movie could have been much better. It had potential, but failed to deliver.
B000LN7HUC|4.0|The stove works great. It's lightweight and compact.Boils water quickly. Only one problem, when trying to store the alcohol in the stove for transport the seam leaks. No problem when its lit or stationary,and the more I use it the less it leaks. Other than that it works fine and I would still buy another one. Can't comment on the pot and pan,I have a SS pot I use instead.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Like the rest of the world, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these books. I quite liked the *story* actually, and the first half of the book, I was thinking \\"wow, I'm going to LOVE these\\" ... but as soon as Christian and Anastasia really get together, it just gets boring with all the sex. It would be ok if it was different sex each time, but it seemed like every 10 pages he was going to \\"f***  her hard\\" and she was biting her lip, and he was grabbing her ponytail, bla bla bla. It was just redundant and I found myself skipping all the sex scenes to get back to the actual story. I did read the entire series - and it just continued, getting worse with each book, I think. It was like \\"oh, they're having sex\\" \\"oh, they're having sex again\\" \\"sex again\\" \\"they're doing it again\\" \\"hey look, more sex\\" \\"wow they haven't had sex for a while!! ... oh wait, now they're having sex\\"<br /><br />I feel like these books would be PERFECT for 40-50 year old women who hate their husbands and need to escape... but for a 22 year old female... it's just blahhh. Less sex, more story, would have been ok. Although the story got a little cheesy too throughout the series. VERY soap opera ish
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|not in the whole hidden object games but this is diffrent. definetly a good time waster if your job allows such items like a kindle at work.
0606259090|5.0|I have to say I am so disappointed by peoples negative reviews. I get that not everyone will like this book but everyone is consentrating on the repetitive words and actions rather than the story line.<br /><br />This is not my normal sort of read as I'm more into crime books, however afterall the fuss about it I thought I'd give it ago and I'm so glad I did as this has got to be the best book I have ever read. It has so my depths to it, it plays will your emotions and I have to admit at the end of the book I shed a tear. This is a first for me. The book also opened my eyes to alog of thing.<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their view and mine is thus is a brilliant book. Forbtjise of you who slate it trying reading it with an insight into the characters and bot focusing on the erotic scenes, it's a story and a brill one at that .
B005LAIISA|5.0|It was great! Laughed from start to end. Sure it makes you think of the previous ones, but we had a good time. All critics aside,... that's good enough for 5 stars for me.<br /><br />***************<br /><br />A little bit more elaborate:<br />We like the Ice Age movies.<br />All of them! Sequel after sequel (or squirrel after squirrel).<br /><br />I always wonder if I'm going to like the next one as much as the previous one.<br />I feel I can't really compare the one with the other, ...<br />why would I anyway,... they are too far apart for me to remember the previous one in detail.<br />I,... we,... enjoy each one as they come out.<br /><br />Afterwards, I try remember the previous one,... actually feel like watching them over again,...<br />Start remembering some of it,... realize it's the same concept,... over and over.<br /><br />(a bit spoiling (?) in next 4 sentences..)<br />Some mayor nature event happens,<br />main characters get seperated from their habitat,<br />which sends then on a mega mayor adventure,<br />as they go on their way, and/or try to find their way back.<br /><br />But we don't care,.. \\"I\\" don't care,...<br />I laughed,.... \\"we\\", whole family (with 7 year old), luaghed, throughout the movie!<br />That's good enough for me for 5 stars.<br /><br />I hope over 50 years or so, ....<br />I'll be walking out the theater with my great grand kids,<br />... still laughing after watching Ice Age XXIX ...<br />(who knows,... perhaps in URLE-D = Ultra Real Life Experience Dimension)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Please don't waste you're money on this garbage.<br />Who the hell  writes in the first person beyond junior high? We're expected to believe a college educated woman whom has chosen to stay a virgin past 20 is going to jump into bdsm without seeing what else is out there first and seeing what she likes?<br /> The erotica is good, but the story line is crap. Definitely not worth the money. It reads like just what it is: an erotic story that was fleshed out into a romance unsuccessfully

0345803485|1.0|If this book was a person I would punch it in the face. I am still mad at myself for finishing it. I am sure that by the end of the story the characters lip was completely chewed off from her constant biting of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|i really liked it<br /> it is really cool to run from baboons<br />the jumps and turns are awesome and heart pounding
0062060562|5.0|\\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" is a page-turner in the purest sense of the phrase. Watson hooks you from the very first chapter and doesn't let you go 'til you've unearthed all of Christine's secrets. And believe me, there are many more than it seems. The real magic of this book is the way in which the reader feels exactly like main character Christine does; starting in utter confusion, gaining facts and insight, becoming even more confused, then sharing in Christine's epiphany in the final stages of the novel. The revelations in \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" will turn your blood icy and the ending will electrify your nerves for days after reading the last page.
0684803356|3.0|There is nothing wrong with Hemingway's skill and technique. What I fell in love with in his writing is all here, except his conciseness. This story could have been 200 pages shorter and all the better for it. But Hemingway was responding to critics that accused him of the very conciseness that made his other works a rhythmic masterpiece of storytelling narrative. Hemingway understood technique better than any writer, and why he let criticism overrule better judgment destroys the pace and rhythmic flow of this story. For a three day period, 470 pages is a lot of cave dwelling, talking, eating and drinking. The stories of Pilar while important also drag the story in pacing. Robert Jordan's train of thought - well let's just say that is a mighty long train. The relationship between Jordan and Maria is a quick and welcome breath of distraction from the mundane cave proceedings.<br />This is still worthy of a read, but you are going to have to spend some time with it and, dare say, slug through some excessive chapters where the rhythm and flow of the story comes to a crawl.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|OK, so here roots music meets Crazy Horse feedback-heavy electric rock, the kind they've been producing since the early '70s (late '60s?).  This is not everyone's cuppa tea, as all the negative reviews clearly indicate.  If you're expecting a Kingston Trio-like Tom Dooley (\\"Tom Dula\\"), or a New Christy Minstrels-like This Land Is Your Land, you will be among that group. If you can wrap your mind around Oh Susannah played in a \\"funky groove,\\" as Neil says on the track, you'll like Americana.<br /><br />What this is, is Neil Young and Crazy Horse jamming their way through a collection of American \\"folk songs,\\" including that traditional favorite \\"Get A Job,\\" a Doo Wop song released by the Silhouettes in 1957. Oh, and also including God Save the Queen, with the lyrics of America the Beautiful interspersed--and with a couple of Neil's own lines ('politics empty tricks').  An eclectic selection of songs, to put it mildly.<br /><br />Besides Crazy Horse riffing to some traditional American music, the album is raw in a couple of other ways.  My Darling Clementine drowns (as she originally did) and This Land Is Your Land contains all of  Woody Guthrie's original lyrics, including the so-called \\"private property\\" verse (As I went walking I saw a sign there / And on the sign it said \\"No Trespassing.\\" / But on the other side it didn't say nothing, / That side was made for you and me.); and Woody's commentary on Depression-era America (In the squares of the city, In the shadow of a steeple;/ By the relief office, I'd seen my people. / As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking, / Is this land made for you and me?), all of which makes these songs 'truer' and more biting than many other versions, despite whatever distractions some listeners will find in the rock jams applied to them.<br /><br />This is American Roots music as seen through the prism of Neil Young, as played with typical gusto by Neil and Crazy Horse.  The many reviews, overall, seem to indicate a tepid three-star-ish reaction.  Instead, the reviews form a reverse bell curve.  There is little or no middle--people hate it or love it.  Add my 5 stars to the love it column.
0743297334|5.0|I remember reading this for the first time, it was better than sex!<br />I have never read a story where the characters were so clear and the writing so concise with absolutely no filler. And that last sentence of the book - I won't give it away, but it's worth the trip to get there. If you haven't read this yet, I envy you! When you start, the narrator, Jake Barnes, tells you about his annoying friend Robert Cohn. He is not likeable, but keep going. When I first attempted to read this I stopped because of Robert Cohn. He annoyed the piss out of me, but he has an important part in this story. So, keep going and enjoy one of the best written novels of all time. And, again, I envy those of you who haven't read this. What I wouldn't do to relive that experience again and again and again.
B0061S073A|5.0|Love this app.  Can't find it for my iPhone though.  I've told my daughter &amp; my friends who are also grandparents.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|the story is very interesting but as I wish for some of devil, dragon, witch or any magic still disappoint. anyway, for anyone who like to read lord of the ring this book is interested.
B0025KW29U|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best written movies I have ever seen. The character development is fantastic, the plot is amazing, keeping in mind that it was made as a webisode during the writers strike and all the actors and actresses were non-paid volunteers. The music is great NPH had a wonderful voice! If your not sure about buying this, look it up online. As I stated, it started as a webisode!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|\\"11/22/63\\" was my first Stephen King book and it was a home run! I have always been interested in time travel and JFK, so for me this was a perfect book to read. I was hooked right away; would have finished reading this book a lot sooner, but my busy schedule kept me from reading it at times. I loved the Jake Epping (George Amberson) character; in a lot of ways I want to be him. He has all the things women look for in a guy. I know it's the 1950-60s but women today can learn a lot from Sadie. She knows her role (which most women today don't know anything about) and still has self-respect. I fell in love with her too! And, pound cake has a whole new meaning for me!!! Over all this book was a good read and I recommend it!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|the  michael connelly novels are well writtin especialy mickey haller @ harry bosh the hold your intrest  till the end @ there is no shortness of excitment @drama recomend this novel for all who like drama @ suspence
0307477479|2.0|Call me old-fashioned or unenlightened if you want but what use is a story with absolutely no plot?  I persevered all the way through thinking that surely she will wrap it all up somehow at the end.  Instead all I got was this implied kind of musing \\"ain't life crazy?\\", the end.  I was extremely disappointed at the end but also fairly frustrated with the format while I was reading too.  Each chapter is from a different character's perspective at different points along the timeline.  The effect is similar to having a group of people somehow connected each giving you a page from their diary at some point from their life.  You can't tell who is writing or when the entry is from until you get deep enough in.  This created a very disjointed timeline that I frankly didn't care enough about to try to really think it through.  I don't question that the author has some talent in writing.  The characters have depth and the chapter's are fairly well written, they just didn't amount to anything when put together.
B007VLHP9K|5.0|Been waiting for these performances on DVD for the last twenty years. Revelatory insight by the master and his orchestra. To be savored privately at night in a cold windy environment, preferably with an aged bottle of Armagnac as companion.

B000SEIDR0|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning more about where our \\"food\\" comes from and the utter destruction of our food system.  The way Michael Pollan takes you on a journey through the life of a cow really highlights the true dilemma we face every day in trying to discern what is food and what is not, as well as the complete take over of the food industry by big business.  There is hope though, and Pollan shows how we can take steps to get back to eating real food.  I recently narrated a similar book called [[ASIN:B008CYX1JS Green Intelligence: Creating Environments That Protect Human Health]]in which the author discusses the impact of vast amounts of chemicals that are being poured into our environment from large corporations every year with little or no oversight by the government.  These books are so important for people to read, as they expose very troubling facts about our environment and the steps we can take to protect ourselves.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good I really an looking forward to reading it.. I really loved the first one can't wait to read all them

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|So far it has done everything I have needed it to do.  Not particularly amused at needing to pay to use the most commonly used fonts.  We will see how it does with coding in Excel.  Otherwise it is pretty good for typing things up and sending them to my GoogleDocs so I can format and post my assignments on my computer after working on my KindleFire on campus.
B005HSL626|5.0|its very adicting and there's never ending fun I really liked this game and I hope there is more soon
B004RLPTT0|4.0|Just ripped open my mail and played my new CD!  Awesome music that truly evokes the surrealism that the movie aimed for.  The movie only achieved mixed success with the feeling, probably due to editing (I saw an earlier screening version that was better than the final product).<br /><br />I also recommend Mae's \\"This Time Is the Last Time,\\" which is a perfect coda to the film.  [[ASIN:B001I78V3M This Time Is The Last Time]]<br /><br />Save yourself<br />'cause the only thing that matters<br />is that you get away from the pain<br />and the thought of losing your mind.<br />Don't blame yourself.<br />It was everyone around you who made you act this way.<br />There's the stage and your chance to watch it go down.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game its amazing and soooooo fun its also great for all age's.I really think you should get this game.
0688152023|4.0|I was expecting more of a low-cardio type workout routine however they are all stretches. The workout does make you sweat a little if you aren't very active but it is still great. I use this book to stretch before running instead of going through all the sequences I choose a couple of stretches each day. I recommend this book if you are hoping to become more flexible and do some light exercise. The good thing about this book is that it not only includes the workouts, but the pictures are very detailed so there is no confusion and there are some tips on how dancers maintain healthy bodies.
