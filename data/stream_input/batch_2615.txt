B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce Willis once again playing the roll he seems to love doing, it seems like he's just playing as one of the boys
B000002GBD|5.0|The Scottish band Nazareth released their most popular album \\"Hair Of The Dog\\", in 1975, for me this is maybe their 3rd best album, behind \\"Malice In Wonderland\\", (1980) and (1977's) \\"Except No Mercy\\".  Nazareth in 1975 consisted of Dan McCafferty vocals 10-14-46, Pete Agnew bass,  Manny Charlton guitar  7-25-41 and the late Darrell Sweet  drums  5-16-47 died 4-30-99.  Manny Charlton produced replacing Deep Purple's Roger Glover, who produced the previous 3 albums, this would be Manny's masterwork.  \\"Hair Of The Dog\\", (more cowbell please)!, one of those songs i truly enjoyed in my high school days, oh the thrill of hearing this song blast through on my new Panasonic cassette deck system back in the day.  I still enjoy this track, just hear it maybe half a dozen times a year now.  \\"Miss Misery\\", put the band on the heavy hard rock realm of Sabbath, great tune, good weight lifting song.  The lament of \\"Guilty\\", written by Randy Newman, piano by Max Middleton.  Manny's guitar shines on \\"Changin' Times\\", Nils Lofgren's \\"Beggars Day\\", with their own \\"Rose In The Heather\\", the band did wonder's on \\"Beggars Day\\", Dan's vocals are the key component here, on \\"Rose Of Heather\\", saw the band slow down the pace, Manny's guitar is sweet as silk here.  \\"Whiskey Drinking Woman\\", the country-western blues sound of this tune kept Nazareth fans guessing.  \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\", with Manny bringing on the synths, this number had a Pink Floyd feel, Manny again gives us some more exquisite guitar.  On the bonus tracks, you get their top 10 hit \\"Love Hurts\\", made popular by the Everley Brothers in the 50's.  Their take on the Tomorrow tune \\"My White Bicycle\\", the melodic \\"Holy Roller\\" and the b-side to \\"Holy Roller\\", \\"Railroad Boy\\", a smokin' Nazareth rocker with great slide guitar by Manny.  And you get 5 BBC session tracks, highlighted by Frank Zappa's \\"Road Ladies\\".  Great release by Salvo, who have done great shakes with Procol Harum, Slade and The Move.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Great to watch.
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|Dio had just left Black Sabbath in 1982, after their \\"Live Evil\\", album.  Ian Gillan had just put the Gillan Band to bed, and joined forces with Geezer Butler, Bill Ward (his last real album with the band) and guitar hero Tony Iommi.  \\"Born Again\\", was a hard rockin' album from start to finish.  I remember when this came out, the critics hated it with a passion, but back then critics hated everything metal and hard rock, the only thing i didn't care for was the baby with devil horns and claws, totally  insane!<br />On their 11th studio album, Sabbath starts off with the thrashey \\"Trashed\\", a great single, Gillan gives it his all on this one, hard to believe they never played this song live on tour!  \\"Stonehenge\\", with keyboard effects by Ggeoff Nichols, can only think about Spinal Tap doing the Stonehenge segment in the movie.  \\"Disturbing The Priest\\", Iommi's guitar squeals and Gillan puts out a great vocal performance, very Atmospheric tune in ways.  The title track, with Geezer's bass, one of the quite tracks.  \\"Zero The Hero\\", one of my personal favorites, total chaos, Gillan in great voice.  On the bonus material you get the riffage  of \\"The Fallen\\", extended version of \\"Stonehenge\\" and  a concert from the Reading Festival with drummer Bev Bevan who was on a break from ELO at the time.  Nice deluxe release.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it is soooooooo fun If you like Challenges this is the game for you NOW GO HAVE FUN :)
0345803507|5.0|The price was good & have read 2 out of the 3 books.  Reading the last one right now.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Joann
145210655X|5.0|I bought this one, and the princess one for my husband for Father's Day. He loves comics. He loves Star Wars. It was perfect! He appreciated that the illustrations stayed true to the original trilogy. No Jar Jar or Ani- both of which drive him up the wall.
1451695195|1.0|Read it. Wasted money.<br />If you go on iPhoto or any of the photo websites, the same butterfly is available to purchase for print. The guy can't even get an original book cover? Good lord. (non pun intended).<br /><br />One star is generous. The title is catchy. The only reason why it's selling like hotcakes is the book title.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, you will like Firefly.  Joss does it again with an amazing series.  Also pick up Serenity when you are done watching Firefly.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a really cute and fun movie! The singing is PHENOMENAL! All the characters are very unique and interesting. I was a little apprehensive from hearing all my friends talk about it, but when I finally did watch it, I was pleasantly surprised. There are some cliche cheesy parts (typical of a movie like this), but there are also some actual &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments.<br /><br />It's also very inspiring: when I finished watching, I had this urge to sing and dance for the rest of the day! ;-)
0812550706|4.0|This was a good story, I couldn't quit reading it, but found myself skimming because it was full of detailed, blow-by-blow details of mock battles and computer simulated battle games that the children were playing. The characters were well written, and I could really feel Ender's loneliness, anguish, and depression. I think teen readers will especially like this book.<br /><br />The sub plot with Ender's brother and sister trying to infiltrate the internet and take over world politics was more than a bit ridiculous and totally unnecessary. I'm trying to visualize how this will be made into a movie, and I hope they condense the first couple hundred pages into a half-hour and leave out the siblings' world domination all together.<br /><br />I'm sure there is some sort of parable here about how we as a society are sacrificing our children for blah blah blah....
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I'll first start out by saying that I generally have a pretty wide range of movies I like. I rarely ever &#34;dislike&#34; a movie, I'm willing to watch any genre from any period at any budget, and I'm not one to harshly criticize...I generally try to always find good aspects in a movie...but this movie was absolutely terrible. About 30 minutes in I was SO bored! I would have just turned it off if I had been the only one watching it. The acting was so cheesy, the story line was lacking, the effects were poor, there were a ton of &#34;3D&#34; effects that were waaay over the top (we did not watch it in 3D--because we hate 3D--so it was even worse because of that). There were several plot holes and very little character development. All of these factors together = a poor film. Don't waste your money or your time.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I love this version of Jane Austen's Mansfield park.  It's very believable. I bought this DVD because I wanted the closed captions and we are delighted with them.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie was very interesting and super creative. It's a long movie (almost 3 hours), but I was captivated the whole time. There are a handful of actors playing several, very different parts and that was the coolest thing about the whole movie. It was interesting and entertaining and I'm glad I saw it, but it wouldn't be a movie I buy and watch all the time ;-)
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It seems like the narrative is being drawn out a little too much.  &#34;Feast&#34; and &#34;Dragons&#34; are frustrating because the various story lines are left hanging and as a reader I wanted more resolution to occur.  However, I liked both books and definitely am waiting for &#34;Winter&#34; to arrive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun and challenging game to play.  You really have to think outside the box on some puzzles in the game.  I'm anxious for more.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is a brilliant implementation of a great idea. Very cute graphics and sound. Love the game and highly recommended it to anyone who loves puzzle games.
B004UXY5D6|4.0|Downloaded this on a whim, had no idea who they were or what to expect but after a few listens I was a fan.  I enjoy finding bands off the beaten path without the mainstream fan base....Whiskey Myers meets that criteria for me.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The cable itself is probably just fine' it's the incredible defective Kindle Fires that we purchased for our boys that are a joke. Not just one of them but both of them have the exact same problem in not charging the device.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|You have to be kidding, why do you have to use real money to use this app, DO NOT get this app, I hate it. You record three videos and then you need coins....REALLY.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is really fun but, honestly, I'm only reviewing it to get coins and to get it off my back about review in  it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like Evernote because I can keep a variety of files and the information is readily available and retrievable.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|What can I say. Everyone was reading it and recommended that I also read it.  I felt the BS&M was laid on a little too thick and that there was little reality to the situation. Until about half way through I was tempted to give it away, but by the end I was hooked.  Having said that I did enjoy the story itself and looked forward to reading the second book.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher. He is too short, too little and just NOT Jack. He did a fair job of acting, however the fild did NOT do justice to Jack Reacher.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|This long awaited instalment in the saga of Eve and Gideon's messy love has finally arrived. I started this one with anticipation, given the cliff hanger that we were left on with the second instalment. Without giving away what occurs in the storyline, the issue of Nathan is resolved but the book finishes with unanswered questions although no big cliffhanger this time.  Another book? Oh yes.  Looking forward to that one too.  Now this one wasn't as good as the first two, I'd still give it 4 1/2 stars.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Quick and easy read that easily accessible and affordable. A &#34;jump start&#34; towards empowerment for my own personal successful life story than begins today! Thanks :)
B007KZY1YY|4.0|The sex was so laid on in this second instalment of the 50 Shades trilogy. I found myself skipping the descriptives of their sex life and focussing on the storyline itself.  I really quite liked the story and felt sad that more effort was not put into developing it.  However I did enjoy the book - even if I really only read about a third after all the skipping.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Totally love this game one of the best games I've played can play it for hours and hours and not get bored really amazing can't complain about nothing
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I think this book was the best of them all. I found the sex far too overdone in the previous two instalments, but not this one.  It was more tasteful and the storyline itself was excellent.  Everything comes together and makes sense of the past (two books). Loved it.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I've been listening to Fall Out Boy for years now and they are known for catchy songs with great lyrics.  This album definitely has those, but it is their strongest album to date.  I've been listening to it nonstop since it came out and I'm still not bored of it.
B00866H7SS|5.0|This story was recommended to me after reading 50 Shades. I have to say that Bared to You eclipse 50 Shades. There is a similar level of sexuality in the storyline, but it is a tad more realistic and without the BS&M.  I fell in love with the characters Eve and Gideon straight away, not to mention the flawed and enigmatic best friend Cary.  The cast of characters were exceptionally described and all interesting. You really feel you know them.  This book is well written and the storyline easy to follow.  Loved it.
B0014LX420|5.0|I buy a lot of music out of nostalgia for my teen years and this is the only album that has stood the test of time.  Britney really is the queen of pop and I've had a blast rocking out to her greatest hits!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I down loaded the kindle version of this as soon as I finished Bared to You. I could not wait to find out what was going to happen between Eve and Gideon. Yes, I know the heroine always gets her man, but the story is so well written that you sit with anticipation waiting to see what will happen. Eve's ex-boyfriend an enigmatic popstar arrives on the scene to create havoc and then there is Nathan....  No spoilers here! Cliffhanger at the end.  Excellent book.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|These books are so great.  I am so invested in these characters, but completely stressed out because Martin does not spare the readers feelings.  He takes things farther than I think they can go, makes them worse than I think is possible, and then kills someone as soon as you think they are safe.  These are long books, but worth the read.  If the length intimidates you, try the audio.  I, personally, love the narrator.
B005JS7W4K|1.0|\\"Brilliant package\\", \\"This package is excellent\\".... What are you talking about?.<br />Nothing to say about the music, but this package (like all the boxes from this series) is simply a mess.<br />If you can... go for the individual cds.
B009GED3HS|5.0|The show remains hilarious even when it frustrates the viewer on how drawn out things get.  I love the direction this season took and I am psyched for the next season (and bummed it will be the final one).  Thank god we know who the mother is though.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved this book read in two days got so hooked in I couldnt stop till I got to the end
030758836X|3.0|It's masterfully written, with nefarious characters and plans.  However, none of the characters are easy to like and most of their actions will leave you with ash in your mouth.  The end, while it took me by surprise, left me feeling sick.  I love books that play with the readers head, but I also want to be able to enjoy it just a little.  It's not just that the characters were unlikable (I tend to like unlikable characters), it's that I found them uninteresting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story and awesome acting.<br />Using Amazon Prime to watch this was a real bonus.<br />I hope I wll soon be able to get the next season via Pime sometime soon.
1423140605|5.0|I didn't love book two, but this one made up for it.  The point of view narrations are from some of my favorite characters and we finally get Annabeth's point of view.  Plus the adventure is everything you would expect from Riordan--funny, scary, and unpredictable.  But be warned--this book has quite the cliffhanger ending!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it I got this game I think its awesome u can upgrade your shark I love it you can buy different sharks it costs a lot of coins I don't care I LOVE IT.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I love Paramore and while this album sounds different from the previous three, I am loving the new sound.  There are a number of Interludes that have an old fashioned sound to them.  Personally, I like them, but not everyone will.  My dad found it helpful to just not include those tracks when he put this on his phone.  The album has great lyrics and great music and I appreciate that Paramore always gives us something new.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Loved it! I like read about Harry and his personal life and the turns it takes.<br />Always leaves me wanting to hear more
B009MYAQK4|5.0|A spiritual book that reminds the reader of what is important in life. Similar messages and themes as those found in The Alchemist, but with less of a story; instead it is a more like a series of essays on topics such as love, beauty, death, loyalty, and conflict.
B004DMIIUU|4.0|I was plesantly surprised how quickly this movie arrived from the seller. The movie shows the same special effects fro &#34;Casshern&#34; but the plot seems better in this one. I must say that so far I have enjoyed this purchase.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|I wasn't sure how an older movie would look when upgraded to Blue-Ray.  I was very pleasantly surprised.<br />The colors were vibrant, the picture was crisp, blacks were black and there was no blurring during any<br />movements.  Well worth the upgrade.
B0043EV774|3.0|Liked the movie but am annoyed that in order to obtain the 3D version I have to pay for separate Blu-ray and DVD versions as well.  They should come in individual packages and allow the buyer a choice.
0385344228|4.0|Great story! I loved how the legal process was revealed throughout the story. The parents emotions are so riveting from one moment to the next, that it is painful watching them under those circumstances. The author did a great job pulling you in and exploring the parents anguish along with legal formalities. Very fast read, you won't want to set it down. P.S. This is a great book for book club discussions!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This was a tough workout that i used post baby. I loved that i could do it from home with little equipment and it was a short workout. Even the beginner routine was challenging. I felt like it was short enoughh that i could fit it in and difficult enough that it did something and challenged me.  Very satisfied with this video.
B00070DK1E|5.0|Jethro Tull it is amaze and this CD it is a great one, everything was fine and good, thank tou.
0345525558|5.0|The story was both happy and sad. Extremely moving book that was hard to put down  While it was fiction, it didn't read like it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a fun game. It is a stress relief after a long work day. I wish the music was better.
1451695195|3.0|This book spends a lot of time in the medical world, with medical language, to document how this was indeed an amazing and impossible event.  Part of me wanted to bypass the medical exhaustive details to get to the &#34;good part&#34; and the rest of me liked the fact that Dr. Alexander spent so much time explaining how this impossible journey was indeed impossible, medically!  It is not an easy read.<br />There is a lot of background given and less of the' journey', although his experience is well portrayed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My girls love this movie. It is a great family movie, again Kleenex is needed.<br />We seem to watch this over and over.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book made perfect sense as to why low fat foods were making me fatter, and it helped explain why I have suffered with digestive problems for years.<br />I cannot wait to get started on my path to health and have ordered Dr. Davis' Cookbook.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait to get more levels!! 10 are just not enough! completed in one night.<br />Please create more levels quickly. Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game highly recommend definitely one of the best games I have on my kindle. I would honestly rate this as my favorite game and its totally free
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Granddaughter (3yrs old) was so excited when she got it. Couldn't understand a word she said when she called to thank us!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a great singer and song writer!!!  Each song is better than next...!!!  The entire cd is great!!!  I totally enjoyed it.

B002V0WN2K|5.0|ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|REALLY FUN GAME I LOOKED UP MOST OF THE SOLUTIONS ON YOUTUBE LOL I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A MYSTERY.
B001AQT11M|5.0|ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!
B00AJLHU3K|2.0|I am a long-time fan of Thompson (since 1980 or so), but I found this to be a disappointing work. Thought Buddy Miller would give this work a jolt, but not so. Have listened to this five times or so and there is nothing I care to hear again. I believe this is mostly due to very tired song writing. Thompson can easily rest on his laurels at this point as far as I am concerned as there are few people who are as intelligent or witty a song writer as he is. This recording just does not live up to his high standards as either a song writer or guitarist. Will hope for better in the future. If better does not come, I am happy to have enjoyed his work for over 40 years--how many other artists could you say that for?
B004G600A4|5.0|ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!
B000068PQ7|5.0|I had the original vinyl version of this, and yes, the label on the recording (not on the cover) said \\"White Light.\\" A fine piece of music, Clark sounds wonderful, and the songs are some of his finest, including \\"For a Spanish Guitar\\" and \\"Because of You.\\" It is also a heart-breaking piece considering Clark died over 20 years ago, but definitely a recording worth having for Clark and Byrds fans.
B00847KFDS|5.0|How much you'll like, or perhaps even love, \\"Wrote A Song For Everyone\\" depends on your willingness/ability to not compare these re-recordings to the originals (they're not meant to replace them) and listen to the album on its own merits. If you can do that, \\"Wrote A Song For Everyone\\" is a fine and very enjoyable release in its own right. [Personally, I'd love a second volume featuring like-minded guest artists that would be absolute perfect collaborators for John Fogerty such as The Black Keys and Ray LaMontagne].<br /><br />Best tracks on \\"Wrote A Song For Everyone\\" are the title track, \\"Fortunate Son\\" (with Foo Fighters), \\"Almost Saturday Night\\" (with Keith Urban), new song \\"Mystic Highway\\", \\"Someday Never Comes\\" (with Dawes), and my personal favorite \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\"(with Bob Seger) featuring a very Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band-like piano style (think \\"Against The Wind\\"). If anything, \\"Wrote A Song for Everyone\\" is a testament to Fogerty's enduring musical legacy.<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com
0765325950|5.0|Epic--from beginning to end. Simply breathtaking. A fitting end to one of the greatest fantasies I've ever read. Most series like this let the reader down when it comes to the conclusion. Not so Wheel of Time. This is a monumental achievement.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing the game Subway Surfers It is easy but hard at the same time I am in Lobe with the game Subway Surfers the awesome characters  and the challenges!
B008XGW1CI|4.0|I'm really torn with this one. On the one hand, the writing is dazzling. Ms. Rowling really shows her talents, particularly toward the end, when she pulls all the plots together. Unfortunately, at least for me, I find the story itself too down beat for my tastes. Almost, I feel as if I'm reading about what happens to the Dursley's after they leave Privet Drive. The characters are all variations on Harry Potter's Aunt and Uncle, with their failings, mean spirited personalities, and foibles. I wanted one character to root for, but sadly, that one person created the casual vacancy and is missing for most of the book. This is not to say Ms. Rowling's failed. I believe she succeeded in her intention--bringing to light a serious problem in her native England. Much the way I recognize the brilliance of Schindler's List, but did not enjoy it, The Casual Vacancy leaves me hollow. Is it good? Yes. But I can't bring myself to say I liked it.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|So far so good. I rather think that this should be part of the macbook instead of having to carry so many adapters. Thin and slim. You win some, you lose some.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Stellar from start to finish.  Rick Rubin did an awesome job with the recording too.  No studio BS here just pure Sabbath.  I love it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book series started off more slowly than I had hoped, but because I had purchased the whole saga, I felt as if I needed to give it more of a chance. The story picks up, and becomes more interesting, but there wasn't a point in time where I felt as if I couldn't put the book down. But, as I said, the story was interesting enough, and it does make you think a bit about how we are treating the world we live in, and each other.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|A good movie that keeps the kids and the grownups entertained! Kids watched it multiple times. And grownups didn't mind.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game if fun &amp; doesn't try to sell u anything outright that will stop you from playing and enjoying it. :3
B005I64U5C|5.0|The 3D effects in the movie are among the best of all available 3D movies in the market. A nice software to test your display's 3D capability.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|What more can I say. Its the transformers, if you grew up as a kid with it you will enjoy the trilogy. I found the movies a little long winded but enjoyed it throughly as I like the sci fi action and comedy.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I never thought a game like this would come along yes I say that a lot but this time I really mean it.  to make it even better I got it for FREE.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Like the setting up of the story, and the terms use to educate you as the viewer. A bit vague in areas but adds to the story line. The comedy line is fantastic and the girl hot......
B007KZY1YY|5.0|After reading the first book Fifty Shades Of Grey I felt the pressing need to continue reading so I immediately purchased this book. When I started reading, I placed my life on hold- I just wanted to read uninterrupted.  The sexual scenes were intense, life like,<br />Sensual and took one on a journey of mind boggling pleasure. If you enjoy great sex and masochism this book will take you into a sex world that you never imagined existed.
B003Y5H59C|1.0|What a weird show, I fell asleep 10 minutes in. Woke up and fast forwarded through it because of the weird things being done. Good for putting you too sleep
B00992CF6W|1.0|horrible game, horrible instructions, horrible explanations.  The biggest waste of money.  You should show previews of games before people waste their money downloading a game.
B0058YPL66|4.0|If your into fairy tales I found it to be exciting. Very interesting how the director puts it all together.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well this game is AMAZING! It feels like there's  nothing you can't do in<br />Minecraft  I bought it and thought it was awesome.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was brilliant in every word written.<br />Nicholas Sparks truly knows how to capture every single emotion. Truly amazing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun app. I like games that make you think and this was one of them. Not too hard but still a bit challenging. I really do wish there were more rooms but can't complain since it's free. I'll wait and see what they add next.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I love the zombie makeup and the first season story line.  The characters are very engaging and believable.  Thank you.
B0086VWCPG|2.0|I like the free version better because it doesn't do anything different with the pro version.  Plus it won't upload to Facebook anymore, it keeps telling me I have the wrong log in and I don't.  Save your money.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It's a fun,fast-paced match 3 game...and those are my favorite kind. Each level gets a bit more challenging....keeps you on your game so you don't get bored with it. Fun
1451620829|5.0|I'm a fan of Peter's and I am very interested in his story and the behind the scenes stories he tells
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|What can I say... If you are on Season 7 the show speaks for itself... Its great... I think many can relate to feeling like they are alone in the world... Thinking they are not normal, weird,  not as good as.... We may not be killers, or violent... but our human condition of suffering because of or inability to express our uniqueness is very common... Dexter is that shadow for some. He is able to express this flawed and taboo side of himself... but at a constant cost... to himself, those he loves or tries to love, and his disowned self... enough.... I like the show.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I like this album, but much of it was, to me, unmoving rehashes of old tunes. It's a Beautiful Day was, for me, the best thing on this album, which was the draw for me anyway.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|This is the type of movie you can watch over and over.  Worth the time and enjoyable for anyone over 16 due to graphic content with a great deal of violence.
0312983867|4.0|I have really enjoyed reading all of the Stephanie Plum novels to my wife.  They are all consistently wacky and suspenseful, but I have forgotten what each of them was about.  It is very light reading and falls out of the mind very quickly
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very well made game! It is a lot deeper involvement than I thought it would be. A must play!
B009NY43NY|3.0|It's a pitty that the book serie is over. *spoiler alert*. I wish there could be more of Sookie's adventure to come and a chance for her and Eric to find a way to be together. I like Sam, he's OK, and he's always been on Sookie's corner. But he's not Eric, and they do not share the same chemistry (unless the Cluviel Dor can chance people altogether). Also, Eric's ending did not sound like him. Just laying low and accepting whatever Freyda, Felipe and his maker impose on him? Not likely! It was a flat ending. Some side stories remained open, but it seems there is an aftermath volume still to come. I'll miss Sookie and Eric. This end was not fair to them and to all of us, who's been faithfully following their lives for years!
0689835604|5.0|My granddaughter loves this book!  We read it over and over--she doesn't get tired of it.  She loves lifting the flaps to look.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is not a high brow adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Rather it is a fun fantasy for lovers of Jane Austen's novels.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Ender's Game had a great storyline. I couldn't stop reading it. It only had one major problem. It was way to violent. Especially when it was hand to hand. That ruined it for me. I would only let kids 12 and up read it!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|They just keep getting better and better! Can't wait to read the next one I think the way he ended this was a great idea and fantastic way to keep the readers guessing.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|I've enjoyed all of the albums by Vampire Weekend. However, I was hesitant about this one, mostly because I don't really play the other two that much. The band is certainly dependable, but I'd begun to wonder if they weren't becoming predicable as well. After streaming Modern Vampires several times on iTunes and Spotify, I realized anew how pleasurable Vampire Weekend's music is. This is grade A pop-rock. The lyric writing is strong, if not brilliant, with enough mystery to keep one coming back.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Happy to get this movie in my collection it was my first 3D movie I saw in the movie theater.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Needed this to complete my Jesse Stone collection.  Really good movie to watch. Would recommend to any Tom Sellect fans.
B00BG4RLF6|4.0|This CD is still growing on me and he has a good voice.. I just want to hear him singing in longer phrases.. but Im starting to like this as a mellow out CD!
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Another solid Alice in Chains recording. They just keep getting better. It's fresh, tight and completely within the niche these fellows have created. i like it a lot.
B00C061I3K|3.0|It is a decent CD, maybe I will need to listen to it a few more times to get into the groove.. Tempo is very slow on this album for much of the songs. I like the two Pharell songs though!!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I have watched the show and now I am reading the books. This one was funny at times and the charters were great.I have just received another book and looking forward to reading it. I would tell anyone to read the books and watch the show.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i am rating this app 3 stars because it it hard to operate  and to understand. Over all it  is a good app. Very fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so awesome and addicting. I love the way it makes you mad somtiimes and makes you happy when you pass a level.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August \\"Auggie\\" Pullman was born with a genetic disorder that has severely affected his face. Even after surgery, he still does not look like everyone else. When he's ten and on the cusp of being a fifth grader, his family decides it's time for him to be in the real world. Home schooling ends, although he's told he can return to it if Beecher Prep isn't for him. He goes through tough times at school, but he's going to stick with it.<br /><br />At school there are people who are fake-nice, real-nice, and not-nice. Auggie knows how to gauge people since he's always received a variety of reactions. We all know middle school isn't easy, so one can imagine how different it would be for someone with Auggie's condition. The book is told through several points of view. It's mainly in Auggie's POV, but it switches to those closest to him so one can better understand his experiences and his role in other people's lives.<br /><br />I had a visceral reaction to this book. It made me smile and cry, and I wanted to hug and praise Auggie and those who were on his side. Next to Auggie, I loved his serious and loving sister, Via. His best friend Jack messed up at a crucial point of their friendship but owned up to it. There were classmates who ignored peer pressure and ignorance. I don't think there are enough words or reviews to sum up this book. I hope everyone gets a chance to read it.
B00821OX98|4.0|Special effects were decent for a television show, hope they get better.  The characters are great and the show is fun to watch.
B00555Z2PS|1.0|Just like my experience with Relayer, This record is totally unlistenable due to the very poor quality.<br /><br />Again I have to place the blame on Friday Music. The vinyl itself is even worse than Relayer. On top of that, this is a double album full of so many pops, clicks and rashes that it sounds worse than my old worn out copy.<br /><br />This was so disapointing to me because this is by far my favorte classic Yes album. I do have to admit that I like a lot of the newer Yes better than the old classic stuff. Take The Ladder for instance.<br /><br />Can you tell that I am frustrated with Friday Music. I said it in my other reviews and I say it again. I don't mind paying a premium price as long as I get a premium product. This album does not even come close. Therefore, it is going back.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Most series tend to start losing quality in the writing by the third year.  Dexter is an exception, even after seven years.
B00009027K|5.0|This is another Friday Music product. Again I was leary. For this record, there is absolutely nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Friday Music used half speed matering on this (I wish they would do this with all their re-masters). The sound quality blew me away. This is a great classic Yes album and to here it in such good pristine sound qualtiy was really a very special treat.<br /><br />My old original copy of the album was so bad, I would not even consider putting on my turntable any longer. It had been quite a few years since I had heard this album. With the depth of the sound quality, I heard things that I had never heard before. Starship Trooper gave me goose bumps.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this record to anyone.
B008OOYALE|5.0|i really like Dragon story. It is a great game. I like how once your dragons are ready they don't expire. Which is great for people who dont always have wifi.
B002QF31HQ|1.0|Out of the recent vinyl purchase lately, this (and Tales From Topographic Oceans) have to be the worst experience with a new album.<br /><br />Again, this is a prime example of Friday Music garbage. These records are so full of pops, clicks, and rash that they are totally unlistenable. The life has been sucked out of the recording. the vinyl is a complete waste of plasitc.<br /><br />I do not understand how Friday Music can be aloud to release this nonsense. I find it so hard to comprehend how the record companies and artists can even approve this stuff.<br /><br />I refuse to pay the premium price for this garbage. This one is going back.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought that A Feast for Crows was a pretty dry read compared to the previous books. George R. R. Martin redeemed himself with A Dance with Dragons! It only took me a week to read.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Like Season One and from what I hear the newly released Season Three, Game of Thrones Season Two kept me enthralled so much so that I had to spend a good day watching all the episodes.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Easy to use and works great with my ipod classic 160 GB 7th generation and my I-phone 4S. It fits like a glove in both units.
B005LAII8A|2.0|A little too silly (stupid?) for my taste and too expensive to have purchased this at Amazon. Some prices are too high!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these puzzle games.  Not too hard not to easy. Good way to kill a little time.  Can't wait for more levels to come out.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Fun movie with a couple a good actors... Nothing super amazing about it. I bought it to watch before red 2 comes out.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Old Time Star Trek I grew up on, Amazon Prime makes it free so it is a good deal. When you are bored???
0385349947|1.0|I have not read the book yet. I'm a bit leary. Every woman I know who has read it has become irritated and resentful at the status quo both at home and at work. It is what it is ladies. Change happens slowly sometimes. I'll read it and let you know if I still feel this way afterward.
0788859544|5.0|I have been looking for this dvd for quite a while.  Not having switched over to Blu-Ray, I have some difficulty finding the dvds I want in the format I can use.  This is the original charming little tale in a format I can play for my precious six-year-old little mermaid.  It is more than a kid's tale, however.  I enjoy it with her.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|shipped as promised and in great shape. The DVD is great .Wonderful addition to  my collection  I will continue getting movies  of same character in the future
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like the game WISH it would give more credits without having to purchase . It could give more often than once a day
B00571F26Y|4.0|Dr Davis' book is a good explanation of why there has been such an increase in gluten intolerance and celiac disease in this country. Not to mention the skyrocketing incidence of obesity and diabetes in adults and children. I recommend this book for anyone who is considering going wheat free.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|The greatest scifi series of all time. I know &#34;to each his own&#34; but I think this is far better than the Star Trek Franchise!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lot of fun games and keeps u busy for hours its worth downloading and no problems freezing up. the kids love the games
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of Downton Abbey! The clothes, the language, the culture, everything! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.
B009JBZH54|5.0|We bought the trilogy and it is just what we expected, the package arrive on time and it was perfect.  The trilogy has a nice book with information about the movie and the quality of the blu-ray is very nice.
0142419850|5.0|Nicely done, just enough drama, took the sugar coating off, put the series in a place where the author can move on...but there is always a way to resurrect things.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is easy to play and fun, I recommend to distract and pass the time. maybe a register of the best players would be great
B008I34ZFW|5.0|I speak German, lived in Germany...there is SO much German humor in this flick!  Good casting, campy enough to make some of the silliness remain funny.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The free seasons of angry bird is a good game and it is free. We only need play and play.
1476712042|3.0|Hoped for great redemption at some point, but was not satisfied. It was silly, high school stuff, time mostly wasted. Also, this needed better editing/proofing. (That bugs me!) Much prefer Samantha Young's books.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you've read the first two books of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" you can't stop there. This book is an absolutely great read. This is my second time reading it and it was better than the first.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|i didnt get the app cuz it seems stupid n from the other reviews it looks like it is so dont get it!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It's fun thrilling and exiting this app is worth the money by the way I bought it when it was for 0&middot;99 dollars but it's still cool hope you enjoy the review
0786891416|5.0|If you like the TNT TV series Castle then you will enjoy this book. The characters are the same and the humor is evident with each page. I was suprised that I would like the book vs the show, but I do and will order book 2. Unlike the tv series Bones, I do like the show but not the books. Give book one a try and you just might get hooked.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is  a great book. I'm glad my co-worker told me to read this. I will tell others to read it.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|it's simple and easy enough and best of all works without wifi! [once you load the maps you need] overall good product Great for free!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Starts slowly, then it catches up. My only complaint is that it describes scenarios or people vaguely and it's kind of hard to picture some of the things mentioned.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I thought I figured out the who dun it half way through and I knew I had to be right. I kind of sort of was. But she keeps you running through the mystery and I absolutely Loved it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game very addictive. Great way to pass  the Time. Would recommend for people who like puzzle games that. Make you think.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable I found this game and cant stop playing it thanks for making this game for me to enjoy
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Although some parts are totally unbelievable, as most romance novels are,this one has some great creativity and innovation.  I would recommend this trilogy for women over thirty (at least).  You have to be older and married to understand that the reality of all this is somewhat different.  I do, however, like the premise of this type of romance novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you like figuring out puzzle games this is the game for u, only problem it's too short of a game.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I am disappointed that Gaiman, who speaks so eloquently about the publishing market needing to change, has chosen to release what is, by my standards, NOT a novel, at the price of a novel.  I purchased this book a mere four hours ago, and even with time for social interaction, I'm now at 70%.  I feel cheated.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is up to Gaiman's usual quality.  Just don't buy it thinking you're reading a full-length adult novel.  You aren't.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is amazing!! The music is great, the relationships are awesome, and the comedy it to die for! I loved it!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I absolutely adore this book.  It is intelligent, sassy, extremely readable, and perhaps most importantly has multiple layers of thought-provoking ideas.  I devoured the book in a couple of evenings.  It's been a long time since I was this enchanted with a book.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I forgot I had set this and this morning I was delighted to wake up to a lovely sound!  this will be ideal for travel, also.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|He shut it down on this one. No more disputes. Nas has to respect him along with every other person in the game now. Cole's it.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|This movie was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad I can't even begin to tell you.  Don't watch it and waste 2 hours of your time.<br />Franco you should be assamed of this movie!!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is a truly epic conclusion to the batman trilogy. Buying blu-ray is a must for a movie this good.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|For me, not worth watching if you have seen all the others, too much of the same but not as good.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|Yuck, I did not like this movie at all.  I have enjoyed the animated version for many years and thought it would be good to see with real actors, but I was wrong.
0375826742|5.0|Along with Eragon, Eldest, and Inheritance, Brisingr is a great book full of action, adventure, fantasy, mystery, and many more! Christopher Paolini does such a good job at writing his books. Even though Brisingr is long (748 pages), each one will captivate you - I read this book within a week. I absolutely love this book and guarantee you will be satisfied with your purchase.
073937771X|5.0|Same as book one and three, fascinating, captivating, cheering on this very different girl, which again tells us “never judge a book by it’s cover”, or don’t judge a girl by her appearance. Well written.
B000NA28I4|3.0|This movie is great if you've never read the book, Eragon by Christopher Paolini.<br /><br />However, if you have read it, I highly encourage you NOT to buy this movie. It cuts out many good scenes that Paolini cleverly put in and instead of being at a great speed like the book, it is rushed and leaves no room to make the rest of the books into movies. The director/script writer absolutely BUTCHERED the book and forced it all into a movie just so that it would be shorter.<br /><br />On the other hand, this would be a good movie if you haven't read the book. The special effects could have been a little better. I loved most of the actors, costumes, and scenery (especially loved Ed Speleers =] ).
030745455X|5.0|Never though I would be so engorged in fiction, leave alone reading three books in a row. But Stieg Larsson captivated a heart felt story of a girl, (very close to true happenings in today's world), letting the reader cheer after every page all the way to the end of the third book. Well done.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book! Drew was a total douche who managed to be someone who I was rooting for anyway. I laughed through the whole book and couldn't seem to put it down.  All of the references were relatable, and I felt like one of Drew's friends as he told me his story. Entertaining and sexy read - I highly recommend it!
B004XQO90O|3.0|I liked the concept of the movie. Hero goes back in time to stop tragic event and save lives. OK. I buy the set up and that there could someday actually be the technology that this could actually be done. No problem. But... once the movie gets going there are some simple questions that just flaw the film for me. Such as, how does the bad guy get the bomb on the train and hide it away like he did? It's way too big to carry on without people noticing. Why would the villian leave his nuclear device unattended in a busy parking lot and assume it would be safe/undetected/not stolen etc? Would someone in this position really do that? I doubt it. Finally, when the hero takes over the body of the other person on the train - what happens to that other peron/personality? Do they simply dissolve? If so, for him to go on living using another person's body and essentially kicking them out is basically equivelent to killing them. Is he OK with that? Is he still a hero or now suddenly a murderer? Summary, good idea, but lots of unanswered questions and situations that seem to be not fully thought through.
B005DGJTC6|5.0|I thought this was an interesting take on the Arthur legend, trying to show how that legend might have come about. I agree with other reviewers that it was very uneven but did begin to find its way toward the end. I found the characters interesting and in some cases-Morgan in particular, very interesting. I found myself routing for Morgan at least half the time. I liked the way they did Merlin, not so much as a court magician but as a more shamanic character. I believe that if there ever was a Merlin, he would have been much like Joseph Fiennes' portrayal. As for Arthur himself, he was a character in flux. But he was supposed to be. The series attempted to show him changing from a dumb carefree kid into a king, adding layers of himself as he went. The final test for me was this: after the last scene, did I wish that there had been more? Yes, I did.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I find this game to be good for brief periods of time, but not for long periods. Great game to play when you only have a few minutes to kill.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I like the Vampire Diaries show.  It is a good series.  However, I didn't read the books and I heard it is different from them.  I think it is still a good tv series.  There is more going on with different people in this season, which I like, and not just focus on the central characters.
1612191290|1.0|The book's premise was interesting.  The theory was put forward.  The conclusion was startling.<br /><br />The delivery itself was an exercise in self-aggrandizing behavior based on satisfying the author's own made up standards.  In every chapter, the author puts up a strawman of his own making and then easily knocks it down thus satisfying himself that the \\"establishment\\" is completely wrong.  Then he proceeds to self-aggrandize by suggesting he's got a unique view point which will completely blow the mind of the reader.<br /><br />Which, of course, the author is satisfied that he did so.<br /><br />To accomplish this \\"goal\\", the author cites both facts and outright falsehoods which he either sincerely believes or thinks the reader will simply accept out of ignorance.  The example of the glaring factual error on Apple Inc. has already been cited.<br /><br />For example, the author cites Neil Bush's adultery with prostitutes in Hong Kong and suggests that every Thai prostitute (note the implicit racism) must be in debt peonage.  That is incredibly foolish because such practices have been well studied.  Some women do choose to work as prostitutes for financial gain, not because they owed a debt.  It's absolutely true that women are held in bondage against their will in debt peonage, but such a woman would never be sent to an expensive hotel for an important client.<br /><br />She might tell the police or the client about being enslaved - ruining the whole point of the exercise.  It only makes business sense to engage someone who charges a high amount because the very price tag is itself part of the message of the \\"gift\\".<br /><br />That's an easily verified fact for an experience anthropologist, especially since the author spends a significant amount of his time on sexual servitude in the book.  Basic ignorance and outright falsehood on easily verifiable facts should be a warning.<br /><br />A great deal of the book's \\"facts' about debt, its abuses, etc... are the same.  Some facts - plenty of outright falsehoods.<br /><br />This book is thought provoking, but readers should be aware that it's provocative because the author is writing a self-aggrandizing tract of dogma.  L. Ron Hubbard would be proud.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I will begin this review by admitting that I am a long time fan of fiction written by Gaiman. I started out with American Gods and went back and forth through his bibliography - novels, teleplays and graphic novels - all the stuff.<br /><br />When I started out reading The Ocean at the End of the Lane I had no idea if it was a mythical story or a regular novel about childhood. I had heard it was an adult novel but still...<br /><br />I will be upfront about it - the book is good. It entertains you, binds you and even makes you wonder for some time. However, even as I read it, I felt that I had read it all before. In American Gods, in Sandman, in Anansi boys... the idea that mythical creatures exist in the same world as us today, and talk the same tongue as us, and are nonchalant about it - it has been done before and Gaiman has done it better.<br />The novelty of that concept, of Gods talking to men and women of our day in our lingo, and admitting to stuff like \\"That stuff is old, it was here before the Sun or the Moon came up in the sky\\" even as they talk about milking the cows, wears off after a while. Then you think about what the story is, and you find out it - its not that meaty after all. Worse, the author seems to be reveling in the knowledge of the fact that only he knows what is really going on - who the Lempstocks are, who the \\"fleas\\" are, and the varmints as well. Hints are dropped and clues left behind, but these - unlike in American Gods - are never resolved. There is perhaps a reason for that. Maybe the protagonist of the novel is too young to be bothered about knowing who are the deities he is interacting with? But do you - as a reader - not care too? The answer to that question would determine how happy/unhappy you would be with this novel, which for all its beauty and moments of joy and wonder - is incomplete.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great puzzarific game i mean a game thats good for ur brain becuz of the puzzle part.....I hope u enjoy this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it because it is a challenge and a fun games all together I say you should get this app
B006LSZECO|4.0|I normally read literary fiction but thought I would try this, since it seemed to have &#34;legs&#34; on the best seller lists.  What fun! The author took a big risk but she pulled it off, in my opinion. A great read for a beach visit or long trip - totally engrossing.  And the Kindle even has underlined passages - not bad for this type of book. Try it, you'll like it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Levels are fairly easy to navigate. A good combination of fun and challenge without a lot of frustration. Looking forward to the next levels!
6305232660|5.0|Best almost end of the world ever. A little long but you will still enjoy it. I recommend this one.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Kaminski value this awesome book that I recommend for anyone she is smart smarter than smart I mean come on polar her
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a very good game.I wish there were 1000 levels to play! This is Way better than most kindle games!!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|It is an amazing show and I will forever be hooked on it. I need to buy the rest of the series so that I can keep up to date.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game sucks if you mess up on a level and you have a of you have so much money and you mess up you loose it horrible game even for free dumb game waste
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I have played this game over and over. It never gets old. I am extremely happy I bought this game. Lots of things to search for and fun little puzzles when you're not searching. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing hidden object games.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Had the same feel as the Wizard of Oz and it was fun tying the plot to the original. I was prepared to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised!
B00006JDVV|5.0|I have seen it before, and I bought it for a friend as a gift.<br />It would be a more realistic view of the aftermath of having dragons!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is a great game! I have enjoy it immensely. I would recommend it to absolutely anyone. The graphics and sound effects are fantastic.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very good book with twists and turns that keep you riveted and wanting more. Another great novel by John Grisham.
0763617105|5.0|My two year old loves this book. The story is simple enough that she can tell me what is going on on every page but it's complicated enough to keep her entertained. It is a great bedtime book and a great book for snuggle time as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I LOVE IT! It's so realistic and fun. I feel like I really have a horse. I recommend this game to everybody.
0517543052|5.0|This is the same book that has been loved since it first came out back in the days of Tim Leary.  While using psychedelics as the author did may help you get more out of the book, the psychedelics are definitely optional.  There is a sort of picture section in the middle that has a bunch of drawn pictures and text.  About 20 years ago my cousin was looking through that part of it for a while and then he asked me, &#34;what religion is this?&#34;  I told him it wasn't a religion but now I think I would tell him it was Hindu.
B00CC1JXYE|4.0|Quality product, just as I expected and I'm very pleased. It really enhances the GS4. I highly recommend this case.
B000ICZD5M|3.0|I used to love this movie as a kid and teenager. I just watched it again, and I'm afraid that it got old somehow. Or maybe I just grew up. The tone is over-prophetic and pompous, and sometimes lacks a bit of energy. The narration doesn't do Frank Herbert's book justice, although I must admit that trying to condense the original book into a two-hour movie is a big challenge. This film goes through a lot of ellipses and shortcuts, and sequences feel a bit rushed one after the other. Some important characters in the book barely get two minutes of screen time.<br />I am still very fond of the graphic design, though. The costumes and sets are amazing.
B008B1VYP0|2.0|I got the album with the bonus tracks. #15 is listed as a cover of the Prince classic, \\"Kiss\\". However, when I play the disc, it is in fact a cover of the Al Green tune, \\"Let's Stay Together\\". Now, I actually kind of like the Al Green cover, but it isn't what is listed or what I was trying to purchase. Now I am stuck trying to get the Prince cover without re-buying the album and it is not turning out to be easy.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album, outside of Levine's voice, I would have never guessed this to be Maroon 5. This is such a far departure from their earlier works it is hardly recognizable. It's not even on par with \\"It Won't be Soon Before Long\\", much less with their first album \\"Songs About Jane\\". Hopefully Adam and company have this phase out of their system and their next album (Which I will be waiting to buy) will start making strides back to their roots.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, challenging little Escape The Room Game. Not too difficult, But Hard Enough To Make You Think, but Not Frustrating.
B007SGM084|4.0|I started reading this book for the obvious reasons. I just wanted to read a naughty book!  Well I'm glad to say it turned into much more then that. It has erotic AND love story wrapped up into one. It held my attention most of the time but was slow at times,which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. A fun book to read !
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A little heavy on the sports details - especially since I don't care for football but overall a good read. Quite different from the movie but necessary changes to keep the movie from dragging a bit.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A program that showcases a quaint small village and the people in it.  The characters are believable and the storyline is entertaining.
B001HN6922|5.0|Great movie. My child was so happy when he got this for a birthday gift. It is a delightful movie for our collections.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I saw th  first season before I read the book. This was absolutely amazing, I have not read a book this well written in a very long time. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game with just the right amount of challenge and addictive too. All of t he different rooms are half the fun. Although I have to say I'm not happy about being forced to rate this app to continue playing. I would at least rather have the option of paying a small price instead of this requirement.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just finished catching up on all of the shows on my DVR and wondered what to start next......Suits was the perfect choice....can't wait to start watching Season 2. Love Mike Ross.....
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I have used this on iphone5 and new Note2. Works well on my Mac too. No issues ever. Lots of templates and icons so it easy to see different acounts easily. Love the favorites option!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Without any spoilers this was a finish Robert Jordan would be proud of and one that answers all the questions and resolves issues in an satisfying way.  Yes characters die that we care about, but it would be foolish to think it was possible for this not to be true.<br /><br />Bravo for doing what I thought nearly undoable.  I will likely read it again, but am glad that I read the whole series in order for a finish and I feel good about this.
B0099XX46Q|2.0|Dark, murky photography, a few stunning effects, ie: the Dark Army being made of glass, the Dark Forest, other than that, I've WAITED to own this, and it was a MAJOR UBER FAIL! They run, run run, fight, kill each other, burn stuff down, a magickal thing happens, they get away~ run, run run, mix it up, fight, fight fight, burn more stuff down, Magickally they get away, run, run run, ad nauseam. I didn't even stay awake for the predicted ending, my new husband hung in there, I zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz'd and it is the absolute WORST, L O N G, BORING film I've EVER SEEN! DO NOT BOTHER!!!! EW!
B002VWNID6|1.0|Very grainy and poor color rendition. Far below what you expect from a DVD, more akin to watching a VHS tape.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A very enjoyable book.  Great for a light read.  Extremely entertaining.  Light and funny.  Great characters and, I could hardly put it down.  I highly recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|NOT AS GOOD AS FIFTY SHADES BUT I LOVED IT ALL THE SAME.  I ENJOYED THE WAY THE STORY UNFOLDED AND THE WAY THE RELATIONSHIP BLOSSOMED
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Different than I thought it was going to be though for this subject very good. D. Washington was wonderful in this movie.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoyed the black &amp; white version of this app. I LOVE the color version. I can spend hours plotting and drawing these pictures. To make it better, the developers are constantly adding updates with more pictures. Definitely one of my favorite apps!
159463176X|4.0|I have to confess, I rate KH's previous two books as two of my all-time favorite fiction books (with A 1000 Splendid Suns being marginally better). So, I had looked forward to this one with a lot of eagerness, given that it has been six years since he wrote his second book. The book starts in typical KH style, and the first 50-75 pages almost make you believe that you are in for a similar treat as what the first two books offered.<br /><br />Yes, there are similarities. KH's ability to weave a story is still at its best. His ability to portray the fallible side of human character is evident in abundance. His insistence on non-contrived endings is intact. But in this one, KH attempts to weave far too many independent stories, and many more characters together. There are links between the various stories, but some links are really very weak.<br /><br />While I appreciated his effort, I felt the book to be a bit unsatisfying. Maybe KH took a bold step and deviated from his previous two books. And maybe a more discerning reader might see the quality of this book better. But for me, it was a very good read, but not quite in the same league as the other two gems.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Touched my heart and I think it is a great read for anybody. Definitely changed my perspective on different scenarios of life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is so cool it's like taking care of a real horse my horse .I honestly think you should give it a try.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have been in the production business for 30 years.  There might be another headphone better out there but for the  money these are a GREAT value.  I own three pair of these.  Not all Sony headphones are created as well, get the MDR7506.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This program is really enjoyable. Continues to tell a really fantastic story. I look forward to future seasons of Downton Abbey.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Great, no problems!Gave it as a gift to my mother in Indiania. she loves it, very much.  order it today!
B004LROOUK|5.0|well organized. good info. useful maps. got is an addition to Guide to Tokyo to help on some side trips. bad there is no mobile companion to download...
0785814531|5.0|I don't have to talk in length about Allan Poe'simportance in America's literature since you are here already. The book is of fine quality. Don't really like the dust jacket, though.
0345803493|5.0|This is the best book of all three.  It really starts to become a story..  All three were really good but I must say this one is definitely the best one.  Going to read it again when I go to Bermuda
B00846F1YW|5.0|I enjoy hidden object games and have played quite a few. This is an entertaining one. The story moves you all over town looking for objects. Some are in silhouette and you have to figure out what it is. This can keep you occupied for a while. If you like hidden object games you should enjoy this one. It is so much better than the pictures of  objects that are in clouds and nearly invisible.
0345803507|5.0|The first was good,, the second was better and the third is the best!!!  I plan on reading it again when I go to Bermuda.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Like Joe and the way he belts out the blues.This was a little different then his studio albums but after listening a couple of times I would rank this right up there with his studio albums.
1623420148|4.0|I have a love and hate relationship with this book, but it leans more towards love. I will give Emma this, the story was absolutely different than anything I've ever read. I appreciate Drew for being unapologetic. He was who he was and what you saw was what you got, until he met Kate, who happened to be one of the few female characters that doesn't get on my nerves.<br /><br />Sometimes the writing voice was annoying, the way Drew would describe his analogies in question form, but at the same time I appreciated it because it was true to his voice.<br /><br />Another thing I liked was the plot twists. It's weird, because it's the kind of story where you think you know what's going to happen, but you truly don't. Everytime something happened that I assumed was close to the ending, i'd see how much percentage was left and be surprised to find I hadn't gone that long.<br /><br />SPOILER!!<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me is when Drew realized he loved her. Wasn't it after he came in her or something? I just kind of rolled my eyes. I know guys love sex but Drew was a mess with it sometimes lol. I also love how it didn't drag through their interactions in the beginning.<br /><br />Good story. 4 stars only cause of my love hate for it and I started skipping a lot towards the end.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Grew up listening to Led Zeppelin. So to be able to buy a single set with all their best songs was a no brainer for me.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great read. Never thought that i would read all five books with in one week. Just couldn't put it down.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|A long film that goes by quickly as the plot pulls you in, enhanced by the reality of on-location scenery.<br />Very strong acting by by the two main characters, the Japanese captor and the British captive officers.<br />The ending leaves you with many leadership, principles and control.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game, I love it soooo much!!!!!!! You can use your own ideas &amp; Show off by getting friends to play on your Best World. Beware though the 1 thing I don't like is Herobrine.
B006LSZECO|3.0|GONE GIRL was slow to get going - it really started to pick up about half way through the book. I had lots of theories about what was going on and one actually turned out to be correct. I enjoyed it, but got a little bored with the story and just wanted to get to the end so I could find out what really happened.<br /><br />This psychological thriller had a lot of twists and turns and definitely proved the old adage \\"there are two sides to every story and then there's the truth,\\" to be correct.<br /><br />GONE GIRL chronicles the life of a couple who have been married for 5 years - life is not peachy in their world. The story is told in real time from the husband's perspective and through a diary of the missing wife. I felt like I was reading a story ripped from the headlines - husband and wife have issues and the wife goes missing then the husband is a prime suspect in her possible murder. I will have to say that I was not pleased with how it ended - not at all.<br /><br />For those of you who follow my reviews, this is not a typical read for me - dark, yes - erotic, no. If you are looking for a mystery with a good story, then you should check this one out.
B001QKSWOE|1.0|Nor well written and the story line could not keep my attention.  Not worth the time to read, I think.
193700788X|5.0|I read this in one day.  I could not wait to see how it ended, though I already suspected.  Someday soon I'll read them all again.
B00CW665VI|5.0|You cannot be disappointed reading this book. NO WAY, NO HOW!  The character development was awesome and the story was so different because it was told from the male leads POV.  I laughed through so much of the book and because I was reading it in the middle of the night I was trying to stifle my laugh (unsuccessfully according to my husband).  It was a beautiful love story with steamy sex scenes throughout.  The author did such a great job with this book.  I can't wait to read more from this author!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Peponi alone is worth buying this CD. I can't stop listening to it. The arrangements are brilliant, and the choice of songs is very ecclectic.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|No Bill, no Sabbath period. Great album though. Nice and doomy. Great thick guitar and bass riffs, good drumming and drum sound ( he is trying to emulate Bill's style which is a good thing ). Nice Ozzy vocals but too filtered at some spots. Great production sound. And get the deluxe version you frugal bastard!!!!!<br />It is so good to listen to this kind of Sabbath music in 2013!!!!!!!!<br />Oh, and by the way,...great songs.....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game!  I like checking all the rooms for clues to solve the problem and get to the next floor. Hope there will be a lot more floors to go. Thanks!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love dinosaurs and animals this game is so cool for me I love it so much it would be cool if there were dragons or other kinds
B008B0QH5S|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys latest studio album doesn't disappoint with a variety of both club anthems and social critiques that make it a great addition to their collection.  &#34;Winner&#34; and &#34;Hold on&#34; remain my favorites from the album but &#34;Requiem in denim and leopard skin&#34; and &#34;Memory of the future&#34; are the popular singles and worthy album additions as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This fun block building app lets you build new and discover more ,only thing is the next update there should be everything that the computer and Xbox 360 has
B004SMD4H2|4.0|For fans of episodic monster of the week series, Haven shouldn't be missed.  Loosely based on a story by Stephen King, Haven shows us one of the weirdest small towns in America and ties it all together with the story of an FBI agent.  Lots of Stephen King references and a few knowing winks at the X-Files, make for some great fun.  The main cast is strong enough but one wishes some of the episodic players and script matched up.
0316120413|5.0|I love when I purchase books and send them as gifts and the receiver gets the book almost immediately!!!  Thank you will order more books

B007N8RULO|5.0|I love to play Spider Solitaire on my Kindle.  I play it on my computer, also, and enjoy it both places.  You won't be disappointed with this game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game but it freezes up every time I use it and the prices r high on character otherwise it's an awesome game and play it every day
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  It was not what I expected.  I still am not sure if I liked it or not.  I really don't even know what to say about the book.  I probably should not even try to review the book.  I guess you should just read it for yourself.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think that  jetpack joyride is a great game for everybody it is always a good game You really should get this game
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am glad to have Facebook on my Kindle.  It is good to be able to check Facebook to see what has happened since the last time I looked, lol.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dont listion to the low star reveiws!!! They r wrong,they think that they cant update it but they r wrong be usse i used to think that,all you have to do to uplode it is goe to the app store and tipe in minecradt pe and click on it,it will say &quot;uplode &quot; then it will uplode the game.it only takes 30 secs to uplode!!!<br /><br />Low stared people that r reading this,just think before you type!<br /><br />And BOOM,i proved tou wrong
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game. It keeps children and adults entertained! I Could play it all day. It's similar to Temple Run 2
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Good music and lots of fun to listen to. Recommended to all who are fans.  Nice to have all the &#34;boys&#34; together again.
0439023483|5.0|I already had this book in the paperback form, but definitely wanted to change it all over to the hard cover collection.  This was a great transformation.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|So, is director M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie \\"After Earth\\" that bad? Is it the worst sci-fi film ever made? I don't think so, as I know there are so many bad sci-fi movies out there, including \\"Battlefield Earth.\\" But there is some campy fun to be had in John Travolta's turkey, which is not at least boring. \\"After Earth\\" IS boring, with a cliché storyline, underdeveloped characters and wooden acting from the stars Jaden Smith and Will Smith (credited in that order).<br /><br />Set one thousand years into the future, the film's contrived story follows the relationship between a military father and war hero Cypher Raige (Will Smith) and his underachieving son Kitai (Jaden Smith). They are the only survivors when a spaceship crash lands on Earth, from which humans migrated, having made it inhabitable by environmental pollution. With his father severely injured, the inexperienced son has to retrieve a communication device on his own, on the planet that is now hostile to humans.<br /><br />With the original story idea provided by Will Smith, which is adapted for screen by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta of \\"The Book of Eli\\" fame, \\"After Earth\\" strives to be both a sci-fi action and father-and-son drama, but becomes none of them. You don't have much action here, and if there is, it is at best dull and thrill-less, with heavy-handed direction and passable effects. As a drama, the film is devoid of emotion, completely lifeless because of the stiff performances from the stars, who take their roles way too seriously.<br /><br />With visuals that are uninspired, \\"After Earth\\" is a very long, dull ride.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I received this movie in very quick timing and I was very happy to see this movie for the first time after all the wonderful reviews that I had received from my friends.  This was a great movie and all of the comments that my friends had told me about it were definitely worth buying it.  I am happy to have added it to my library of movies.
B00CATSONE|4.0|this was a good read. Learn a few new things, and also it was actually a good book about creative genius, and / or in general how to be such oneself! Win win!!
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I first moved to the Hollywood area when they were showing this movie every Saturday night at midnight with all of the audiences very much involved in the movie.  I kick myself every day that I never made it to witness this whole experience in all the years that I was so close to it.  I am so happy to have this movie in my possession now and totally understand how everyone was so completely in awe of the movie.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Moving the character one needs to see it and control it, using the finger over the very place the character is makes it a tad frustrating and not so easily doable. Also the thing seemed not to respond well to the touch screen fingered movements (probably due to my Maylong LLC,  cheap Tablet's less than stellar  &#34;SWIPE&#34; sensitivity).
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I had read the book and this very much follows the story, which I find so much not to be true in the movie interpretations of the books.  This was well done.
B00C1BTWV4|3.0|I was hoping for something better.  The music and images were great!  Here are the required eight more words, people!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love the disney and animation movies and am very happy to have added this movie to my collection.  I hope to share this with my daughter and granddaughter some day.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I’m very happy with AKG headphones, this is my second set of AKG headphones they the sound is great!! Thank you.
B004G6009U|5.0|I have heard so much about this movie, I was really excited about being able to order and watch it.  This is such a great movie, it shows so much about love within family and respecting each other's independence.  I loved the movie and am so happy to have it in my collection.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|In my college days I was supposed to read this book and do a report. What a shame I chose not to robbing myself of a class is book which shows the transgression of wild to tame back to wild again as the call to nature and trusting in it overrides anything taught by man. GREAT BOOK easy to read and to understand why it was chosen by my instructor some twenty years ago.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was the one of the best way to have fun I like this game very much I like the way it works.  :)
B003TML0VO|5.0|Great songs redone by a guitar legend and the MP3's that came included was great.  I recommend this to anyone who likes Santana or classic rock.
1452110581|5.0|Got this for my crazy cat lady girlfriend. She loved it and we got several good laughs out of it.
B008BDZP3K|2.0|There are some good moments on this and some other Zappa albums but come on people. You guys think this stands along side of bands like Return To Forever, Weather Report, King Crimson, Gentle Giant, Yes, etc. etc?? I am all about his story and how he composed so much music of all genres and everything, but there is too much pointless noise and jagged sax sounds to please the ear. The opening track \\"Peaches En Regalia\\" is great and reminds me of Weather Report a bit but there isn't enough here to call it a classic or for it to receive so much praise. Within the zappa community he was a genius, outside of it he was a sober eccentric who occasionally landed on melody in his compositions. Go listen to King Crimson-Lizard to hear a similar sound but perfected. Just one opinion.<br />What your opinions on  The Grand Wazoo?... to me that is by far Frank Zaapa's best work.
0525478817|5.0|This book deals with many issues: young love, heartbreak, disease, friendship, family and so much more. John Green has a wonderful way of inside teenager's minds. This book is not just for young adults but also for all ages, minus younger kids.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it!  Looking forward to downloading rest of this exciting story very soon! I highly recommend this to sci-fi fans.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is in it's 8th(going on 9th season) and it still is amazing! The storyline is a little weird at parts but I can get over that and just enjoy Sam and Dean and Cass
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|Well, all I have to say is WOW. I think this book was great! I think the ambush was written in great detail! Nothing was bad about it. This book would be great for anyone over 4th grade. But this book would be especially good for anyone enjoying the series. 5 stars!!!
0316232955|5.0|This is a great book for all ages! Chris Colfer has a wonderful way in getting into the character's head.
B002ZP1STK|5.0|From the trailers I thought this movie was solely about a boy searching for his biological parents, and using music to find them.  I was sorely mistaken, and am very glad that a friend recommended this film to me.  It has the depth you want in a great love story, but seldom find in most modern pictures.  I only wish the writers (or perhaps director?) had focused more efforts on the varying types of love capable within a family - you'll see what I mean - rather than introduce an outside business &#34;family&#34; structure as well.  But then again, maybe the contrast of the two adds to one's grasp of the familial love.  Either way, a true joy to watch as a family and as a couple.  Loved it.
0061733199|4.0|its a useful book to have as well as informative! I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in survival and living off the earth.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|If you are discouraged about the current state of our health, corporate greed, the state of politics in America... One positive step everyone can take is to disengage a little or a lot by just cooking your own food. Crazy but true! Enjoy! Cooking can feel empowering, be fun and bring your family and friends together. Try it...
B00AAQWZWU|5.0|All I can say is: &#34;Thank you for all the relaxing moments I have when listening to Eros's music!&#34; I never get tired of listening to his music...thank you for delighting us, Eros!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album is AMAZING. Start to finish. I don't care about the length of the songs. That just makes it easier to listen to. It all flows together so well. \\"New Justin\\" , \\"Old Justin\\".. To me those kinda of things do not matter. As an artist it's up to you to recreate your \\"Sounds\\" And or re invent YOURSELF. Each song tells a story and takes you to another place. That being said, BUY The album.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|As with most shows on PBS Lark Rise to Candleford is a good story and good production. Sets, scenery, costumes are great. Script is believable as are the characters.
B008B68IV8|5.0|My daughter loves this toy.  If you are a monster high fan, you will not be disappointed in this toy.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this on  a Kindle Fire. It is great! The display is very adequate for the size of the screen.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the third time I've read these books and I'm still in love!! Can't wait to see the movie and to see if E L James will write more! She's an amazing writer!!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I can't believe that I have never heard them before. I went out and purchased a second CD by them.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is a golden CD. I love all the tunes on it, and they never get old. Gotta love Dave Brubeck!
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|I read this book on the recommendation of several friends who are fans of the series. I found the book to be a light read, entertaining and cute.  I enjoyed the imagery the author created about Botswana  making me feel as though I was actually there have tea with the main character. I also enjoyed the way the author built the characters in between the cases she dealt with at her detective agency.  It felt as if you knew them all well.  Having said that, I did not find that the book had enough depth for me. Though entertaining, it was not substantive enough in plot.  It is a good summer read, or a filler book between more serious books.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I have come across many 'short' book of Shrlock Holmes and 2 digests, so this was a natural for me.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|My CPU fan is not constantly on Full while watching videos like it was with stock CPU cooler.  Wasn't sure if it would fit in case, but it did, BARELY.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|the acting is mostly bad, but the dialogue is awful! the plot is paper thin and really just an excuse to have a series of jokes strung together. as a Kid i adored this movie. as an adult (watching it with my son) I think I liked it more.<br /><br />The memories of watching this when i was young account for most of my enjoyment. but the appearances by Wayne Knight, Danny DeVito and Bill Murray were fun because i had no idea who they were when i was young. also seeing a movie use &#34;I believe i can fly&#34; totally straight and without a hint of sarcasm, was immensely fun.<br /><br />The only thing i have to say as a true positive to this move is that the special effect (Combining live action a cartoon) have held up remarkably well, and the animation is very clean and crisp.<br /><br />if you have never seen this movie don't wast your time. if you are a Looney Toons fan (Mel Blonc was the king of voice acting) don't wast your time. if you in the mood for a clever family comedy don't wast your time. but if you watched this when you were a kid and you have kids of your own now, then watch this and let your children remind you what you loved about this when you were young and naive.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Once started I could not put it down.  Stayed up late reading and skipped lunch to finish.  It read easy.
B001OMJGD0|3.0|as a modern superhero film (Like Spiderman, Iron Man or the Dark Knight).<br />It's plot is a poorly developed rehash of the plot from superman one (with Christopher Reeves) characters are under developed. We are often told &#34;they have history&#34;,  rather than the film showing us why Lex hates superman or why superman loves Lois. characters seem to do thing not because it makes sense but because the script says they should ( Like superman Listening to the problem of the whole world and then deciding that a bank robbery in metropolis is the worst thing happening in the entire world. over all the tone is goofy and feel very out of place in the modern world of superheros.<br /><br />As a Love note to, and the final act of the Richard Donner Superman trilogy of the Seventies.<br />the film was conceived as a sequel to Superman II (the Richard Donner Cut, not the theatrical film) and it is meant to be the final chapter in a trilogy (it pretends Superman III and IV,did not happen, since they were not made by Donner) when viewed as part of the trilogy it works. the characters flow nicely from the original films into this new story. (despite being recast entirely) the tone is consistent with the Donner films, being both silly and self deprecating. while at the same time telling a deeply human story. the focus is on spectacle (of an often ridiculous nature) instead of action or combat.<br /><br />So my conclusion,<br />if watched by itself... It's Bad.<br />If watched with the Donner superman films... it's Good.<br /><br />A final note.<br />no mater how you watch it... the scene where superman hides in a tree and uses his X-ray vision to spy on Lois and her family as they prepare for dinner... Is all kinds of creepy stalker Superman.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|This has become my favorite movie. Not only is it well produced, its message of servant-leadership is needed in our generation.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|it's fun and high paced, with awesome action, killer comedy, great performances (especially by Alan Tudyk), an moving story. also, more video game trivia the all other movies combined. it dose not matter who you are there should be something to love here.<br /><br />this is my favorite cartoon (CGI) movie to come out in years.<br /><br />Note<br />it does have some intense action and a few scenes that may be scary for young children. there were also some very intense character interactions that made my son cry.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great feature on Amazon...being able to purchase and watch videos and whole TV series that I can't get on Hulu or Netflicks!
B00005JMCW|5.0|I love this movie. Back before Lindsay Lohan made headlines for being arrested, she was a great actress. The way both she and Jamie Lee take on each others' personalities once they switch bodies is just fantastic. I will forever love the acoustic &#34;Baby One More Time&#34;!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty good. really fun. good thing to do to burn some time. its kind of slow on my kindle at times, but still fun.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|While his score for Star Trek 2009 was fantastic, Giacchino takes it up a notch for the sequel. The score is powerful, exciting, compelling and intense while keeping some fun aspects from the original series and its films.
B00506NRBS|4.0|Derek here does a great job of sharing his story, his failures and his successes, without telling the reader this is the only way to succeed. Indeed, he opens the book by telling us that we should walk our own path instead. If you're looking to be inspired to step out and risk greatly, in your own way, this is a read way to do it

B008WCP2PG|5.0|every woman should own this movie! its a nice change in the mostly women stripper/dancer movies that are out there. you don't even have to listen to the story or the words. the dance scenes are priceless. the storyline is good too.
B008R14YBK|4.0|Well, she has done a very dynamic cd, very colourful, musically speaking. She's got a great voice, I like it!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|a very cute movie for young kids and adults too. teaches the importance of trees and protecting them. really was a good movie worth watching again and again.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|Well, I guess I expected more from the cd. She's got a wonderful voice but some songs are regular whereas there are some great songs.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the humor of the show.  The set of actors is great as well -- none of it is corny and the episodes are well told. Each judge/lawyer has their own distinct personality that makes you WANT to keep watching them even if you hate them. Great cameos, too, and Matt Czuchry...I could watch him all day.

0920668372|1.0|I regret no reading the reviews with one star.  In fact, I think I simply saw that 1,159 people had given this 5 stars and figured this book must be perfect for my kid.  It's probably the first time that I was misguided by reviews, which I truly rely on!<br /><br />I don't know who could like this book or even consider it appropriate for a child, or an adult for that matter.  My husband and I read this together and kept laughing in that disturbed kind of way we all do when we come across something that's just creepy but not supposed to be.  I don't know how else to describe it.<br /><br />Brief summary:<br />About a mother and son (there's no father).  First page has mother holding baby, rocking him, and singing a little song. After that page, the pages are devoted to the boy is growing up, at various very random ages.  At each age mentioned, the boy does something naughty or misbehaves and the mother yells at the son.  Then at night, AFTER he's asleep, she crawls into his room, holds him, rocks him, and sings him a little song.  This happens at EVERY age.  Read below for more details of the creepiness.<br /><br />There is no doubt value in books for mothers and sons, especially single mothers with absentee fathers, but this really can't be it.  Seriously?  I haven't looked for such books, but please tell me that children in this family situation have healthier stories and children books, where the mother isn't creepy, infantilizing her son throughout his life.<br /><br />Who this book may be for (to give a benefit of doubt)<br />--I really tried to think of something, but I can't think of a single scenario, except that it ends with the son singing for a frail old mother in the way she sang to him growing up.<br /><br />Here's what you need to know why my husband and I feel this book is inappropriate and creepy for child and adult:<br />1) mother crawls into his room on all fours after boy is asleep.  Why does she need to crawl?  Fine, you want to reassure your child that no matter what he does, you still love him.  But wouldn't it have been more comforting if he's awake and the mother goes in with confidence<br /><br />2) when the child is an adult and living in his own home, she drives at night, and CRAWLS THROUGH HIS WINDOW. And there is an illustration of an older woman holding a fully-grown man<br /><br />3) the son holds, rocks, and sings to his mother when she's frail and old, but how does he know what to reciprocate when his mother always waited for him to be asleep to do the same!  I'm being sarcastic... before someone thinks of the subconscious awareness this child developed, etc.<br /><br />4) why is there no mention of father or a presence even in the illustrations? Perhaps it's for single mothers?  As I mention above, even for sons with single mom's and absentee fathers, it's hardly a positive story<br /><br />5) the verses are odd<br /><br />  &#34;I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be&#34;<br /><br />--Not soothing or comforting in the sound, nor appropriate at all ages<br />--Not sure if the if the mention of &#34;as long as I'm living&#34; is this supposed to inspire a discussion between parent and child about death, to help the child know that mother's eventually die<br />--Are we no longer our mother's child after she dies?<br />--And why &#34;baby&#34;?  The mother infantilizes her son long after he's a baby, even as a grown man<br /><br />The author has a right to write whatever story he envisions, but at least the mother could have portrayed as a confident woman, a mother who can walk into her son's room on two feet (rather than crawl on the floor) to reassure her child that no matter his mistakes in life, she'll always be there for him.d that no matter what he does, you still love him.

0385732554|1.0|I absolutely loved this book... up until the last few chapters. It all started going downhill once Jonas and the Giver began planning their ridiculous solution to their society's problems. It was rushed--the ending of the book and the plan as well. Maybe I'm just a firm believer that words should be more powerful than memories being magically transmitted to the community. Honestly, this entire book would have been better if magic wasn't a part of it. I really didn't mind it at first, though I had expected the memories to be given through stories rather than being experienced by Jonas. It would've been much more powerful if they instead talked of humanities horrors and wonders, and then shared their knowledge and wisdom with the community. Really, the magic was not even so bad to begin with, but the ending just completely took advantage of it. There was no depth left in the story by the end of it, not like it ever had too much. I was so disappointed in the ending of what could have been a great book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. This book just blew me away. I could almost feel Alfred Hitchcock and Patricia Highsmith peering over my shoulder as I read (metaphorically speaking, of course, because I listened to the audio version). I am disturbed by the number of 1 star ratings for this work of genius. Not all books have to have uplifting endings to be masterpieces, and books like these might not appeal to everyone. But the writing was excellent and the plot, well, masterful and inventive to say the least. Oh the book is dark, too be sure, but it is picture perfect in its suspense. I will admit that I really didn't care for either of the main characters but that is part of its genius. You don't really take sides in a book where you can't wholeheartedly root for either character.<br /><br />I did make sure I was only aware of the premise of the book before I started so I had no idea what was coming. That would be my advice to you if you want to read it. Come with no expectations and let the story envelope you. To the author's credit, only one clue gave me a premonition, a spark that caused me to speculate about the ending. It takes real talent to create suspense like this.<br /><br />NOTE: The audio version was fantastic!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love it I looked at the reviews and I was not so sure about getting it but I gave it try. I loved it . It's just like minecraft! Here comes the bad part though . You make your house and everything then the trial ends. I think if u like minecraft you should get this.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It's been a long time since I read \\"Red Dragon\\" or watched \\"Manhunter\\" or the remake of the same name yet this TV series is right up there with Silence of the Lambs which I consider the top of the line in this series. They begin in exactly the right tone by indicating Hannibal is not merely a serial-killing, bon viveur psychopath, but something else that is way off the charts. It makes him a mystery and that is what keeps you watching. The settings are incredible as are the direction, dream sequences (David Slade directed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) and the production values. Acting talents score highly. Lawrence Fishburne brings his authority, bitter compassion and focus to Jack Crawford; Hugh Dancy is wonderful as the increasingly \\"unstable\\" empath Will Graham working with the FBI, and among the many guest stars is Gillian Anderson who plays Hannibal's psychiatrist. Hannibal himself is presented with finesse by Mads (great name!) Mikkelsen, For the audience members who have read all the books in the series and seen all the films made there are many little homages and nods they will recognize. The stories concentrate more on the solving of the crimes where we identify with Will Graham, than the gore, or Hannibal's crimes, the commission of which we are usually spared.) The crimes ARE following a pattern, just not the one the FBI thinks they are. Since Hannibal is (thank god) a creation of fiction, there's no telling where this will go next.

B00CW665VI|2.0|Statistically, I realize I am in the minority, but I thought about this for quite awhile - so here goes:<br /><br />(Potential spoiler?)  As another reviewer said, there isn't anything remarkably great in this book. The hero is a cad, the female is a hard-workin' girl from small-town Ohio, the sparks fly, they finally coalesce in a weekend filled with sweat and hormones, there's a big misunderstanding, etc. etc. There. Done. (There's more, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone....)<br /><br />Because of its detailed and explosive sex/passion and the explicit language, I almost thought this was trying to be another 50 Shades, but at least that story had a plot, and its characters had some complexity. This doesn't have much of either. It's pretty basic, nothing earth-shattering.  The hero is not a nice guy, but he meets Kate and is blinded by the light. Kate is a very sweet, very smart girl. They are attracted to each other (for some reason). He needs to do some serious changing for this to work out.<br /><br />The author uses the male-POV-as-narrator idea, which worked sometimes and other times not. I didn't feel the \\"male POV\\" was as much male as it was a female-POV-of-a male-POV. Drew was way too chatty a narrator, and it felt very female. I also thought his \\"POV\\" was very stereotypical and over exaggerated. So I didn't find it very convincing.<br /><br />The author wants us to believe our hero's transformation is because of another woman - not from a life event. This, again, is a female POV of a male POV -the myth that a woman can \\"change\\" a man (there's that teenager thing......) Drew is shallow, not only as a person, but as a character in this book. There's nothing complicated about him, and nothing earth-shattering about his revelation of his wayward ways, other than he attributes it all to Kate.  This story would have been so much better if something had actually happened to him that truly humbled him - something other than losing the girl that he wants to \\"nail.\\" Like a near death experience, or a stock market crash, or loss of a vital organ or something.<br /><br />To quote another reviewer, I didn't find the book to be as funny as everyone else, but I also found myself laughing at it, not with it. (Except for the Bad Word jar- that was good.) The \\"jokes\\" are a bit sophomoric and predictable, and the characters seemed like they were delivering lines from a mediocre sitcom. One can almost hear the canned laughter.<br /><br />It reads fast - very fast - probably because there is not much in the way of descriptive prosaic passages. And if you don't like the f-bomb being dropped every other page, I recommend you step away from this book.<br />There's something to be said for why I stuck it out with this book, although it was a close one (I'll blame a few of my favorite reviewers who both raved about it.......). I'm a sucker for love, and a pushover for redemption. That's minimally what you'll get with this book, along with some titillating lust scenes. I guess there's nothing wrong with that - just don't expect much more. I would have given this book one star for quality, but something drove me to finish the book, so I gave it 2 stars for drawing me in. But that was probably the teenager in me.
B003M6EAXM|4.0|Final season was a good as the others although a bit more unrealistic - but if you are into the series - you'll like it.

B009AMALLM|3.0|The entire reason I kept watching past the first film was that the series was slowly developing a story and back-story that made each new one worth watching. Those involved in this simply made a film that \\"looked\\" like Paranormal Activity but really was not.<br /><br />Shame to. Finally we see what became of the Aunt and Hunter and it's a let down.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />First of all, why on earth was the kidnapped boy put up for adoption? Where did the second boy come from? Why does the boy make funny things happen but never do anything?<br /><br />Well, my answer is this, the director seems so fixated on his 14 year old actress being in her skimpy sleep-shorts every chance possible that he forgets they are making a movie -- I started to wander just what fascination he had for this girl who is constantly in little shorts and at one point is levitated out of bed for absolutely no reason?<br /><br />Second, what's with all the hand-held camera work? Obviously these people don't walk around holding the camera out and making sure they film everything, yet that's what happens. The other three films knew the camera's had to be constantly explained and justified, this one doesn't care. I felt like the camera-man was the main character here.<br /><br />Third, where's the scary parts? The shape of the demon showing on the Xbox kinects dots should have been creepy and instilled dread, instead it was ... uh, whatever. My wife figured out that the kid was adopted and the neighbor kid was not hunter about five-minutes into the film, so when he starts screaming \\"i'm not hunter\\" but he is, we don't care.<br /><br />In the first three the little things the evil did seemed to be it pushing it's way through to our world and gaining strength and getting better and better at possession and killing, this time it's just the director moving props to try and startle us.<br /><br />The director should have just taken his actress and re-made Lolita, since the camera seems obsessed with her anyway. There's no logic to these camera's -- she's got a high-def night-vision camera rolling in perfect frame as she is being chased by a demon through a house trying to follow her being-dragged around father ... that makes sense? The only time the camera works is the one in living room that is stationary and when her smart-phone falls and keeps recording when she is locked in the garage -- the rest of the time we see how lazy the production is by not bothering to justify the footage. Plus, they show way too much when they show it and they re-use all the same tricks to no good effect.<br /><br />I'm sad to say there's no point in watching this.with her anyway.

B000002AVF|5.0|Continuing my Mariah Carey Album track by track reviews.<br /><br />Daydream is Mariah's 5th major studio album (excludes her MTV EP) and a fan favorite for good reason. Like Music box, most of the songs are slow or mid tempo, however around this time they start to get a more R&B flavor and the songs become more personal. Oh, and her voice sounds better than ever, that doesn't hurt.<br /><br />1. Fantasy: Uptempo, nearly identical melodically to Dreamlover from her previous album, but with a breezier vibe. 9/10<br /><br />2. Underneath the Stars: Mariah starts to sing with more whispery vocals in this album, and it works wonderfully in this intimate lyric-driven number. 9/10<br /><br />3. One Sweet Day: Mariah collaborated with BoysIIMen and the result was a song that sat atop the charts for 16 straight weeks, a record! The song has some gospel as well as R&B influences. 9/10<br /><br />4. Open Arms: A breathtaking cover of Journey's song. 10/10<br /><br />5. Always Be My Baby: The hits keep coming, I adore this song! 10/10<br /><br />6. I Am Free: Slow ballad with gorgeous lyrics. 9/10<br /><br />7. When I Saw You: Great ballad, but then again aren't they all? 8/10<br /><br />8. Long Ago: Uptempo again! Almost hip-hop with a very catchy beat. 8/10<br /><br />9. Melt Away: Very subdued, sensual, soothing, all that. 10/10<br /><br />10. Forever: A ballad nearly on par with \\"hero\\" and \\"Without You\\". 10/10<br /><br />11. Daydream Interlude: A club mix of Fantasy, pleasant but too short. 7/10<br /><br />12. Looking In: Haunting, introspective, and personal. 9/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 9.08

B0000028VT|4.0|Continuing my Mariah Carey Album track by track reviews.<br />Music Box is Mariah's 3rd major studio album (Excludes MTV EP) and her best seller in terms of worldwide records sold. The album includes some of her most iconic songs, but also features less variety being a bit of a ballad overdose. Nevertheless, I'm sure many fans still have this record as a favorite because it features Mariah's prime vocals along with zero guest rappers.<br /><br />1. Dreamlover: uptempo dance track, head-bobbing time! 8/10<br /><br />2. Hero: The first composite of this song was actually written by Mariah intended for Gloria Estefan to sing for the movie \\"Hero\\" (1992), however this never happened because her team convinced her the song was too good to give away. Afterwards, she rearranged the the song to be more personal, less sappy, and bring in a more R&B/Pop feel. Everybody knows this song it's a modern classic. 9/10<br /><br />3. Anytime you Need a Friend: It has a gospel feel with the accompanying choir, very nice! 8/10<br /><br />4. Music Box: Glorious slow-tempo ballad. 10/10<br /><br />5. Now that I Know: Uptempo fun track! 8/10<br /><br />6. Never Forget You: mid tempo, blissful ballad. 8/10<br /><br />7. Without You: Cover of the famous Harry Nilsson song (1971), just incredible. 10/10<br /><br />8. Just to Hold you Once Again: Slow depressing ballad. Good, but a bit similar to everything else. 7/10<br /><br />9. I've Been Thinking About you: A really fun uptempo song! 8/10<br /><br />10. All I've Ever Wanted: Very good, but also another slow ballad. 8/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 8.40<br /><br />-Bonus Track on international edition-<br />11. Everything Fades Away: Why oh why didn't you release this song on the US edition Mariah??? Mariah's background singer Trey Lorenz (sang \\"I'll Be there\\" at MTV) accompanies Mariah in this lovely slow ballad. 9/10

B003IMV8HG|5.0|Continuing my Mariah Carey Album track by track reviews.<br /><br />Butterfly is Mariah's 6th major studio album (excludes her MTV EP) and a massive turning point for the 'songbird supreme'. Recently divorced from her husband and manager Tommy Motolla, the new Mariah was far more overtly sexy after years of acting like the shy girl-next-door; The noticeable shift from pop to R&B with hints of hip hop only added to confusion for her fans. At the time Butterfly didn't achieve the commercial success of her last two albums, but today many would consider it her magnum opus.<br /><br />1. Honey: Mariah's true hip-hop debut and absolutely one of her best uptempo songs. 9/10<br /><br />2. Butterfly: Originally written about a possible later reunion with Tommy. The lyrics in this ballad are incredible and the message is very positive. 10/10<br /><br />3. My All: Has a similar feel to \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", one of the best songs on the album and that's high praise indeed. 10/10<br /><br />4. The Roof: Understated vocals and haunting melody in this pure R&B song. 10/10<br /><br />5. Fourth of July: feels like many songs from \\"Daydream\\", that's not a bad thing. 8/10<br /><br />6. Breakdown: Another Hip-hop track relying on lyrics and melody, impressive. 9/10<br /><br />7. Babydoll: Mariah Collaborated with Missy Elliot for this soothing R&B track. 9/10<br /><br />8. Close My Eyes: Very personal lyrics sung almost too softly. Most people love it though I've seen others that even hate it. 8/10<br /><br />9. Whenever You Call: Another song that could have been on \\"Daydream\\". Breathtaking. 10/10<br /><br />10. Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise): Butterfly club mix, enjoyable. 7/10<br /><br />11. The Beautiful Ones: A prince cover and another song people love or hate. Personally, I liked it very much, despite it's long length and repetitiveness. It features Dru Hill harmonizing with Mariah. 8/10<br /><br />12. Outside: Another intimate personal number similar to 'Looking In' from the Daydream album. This is incredible. 10/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 9.00am album. This is incredible. 10/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 9.00

B00BWBHIUG|1.0|You can only do so much unless you have pearls.  I'm usually willing to wait until I accumulate enough pearls, but the game designers try to force you into spending money.  This weekend they have timed offer to get a special new fish by opening treasure chests.  In the past day and a half, I saw one treasure chest that you could open for free.  All of the others were offered at 6 pearls.  Just for the heck of it,  I bought one, and got a measly 535 algae (I have over 27000 algae - I don't need more right now).  In the past, I have had treasure chests that were free or offered for sand dollars, which isn't bad because I can accumulate sand dollars if I keep playing long enough.  Pearls take a lot longer - about 3 days - but of course you can buy them for real money.  Ripoff...<br /><br />I have no problem for the game designers to offer things to speed up your progress if you want to pay, but when they make it impossible to progress unless you spend money, it's a money grab.  Shame on Disney!

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|The movie gave the original movie a back story and incorporated the original look with new more expanded world that looks very much the same but thanks to advances in technology now the OZ world is opened up.  Great movie...

B002Z0TPFE|4.0|I went into this movie with low expectations and although I wish they could have followed the cartoon series with a serious approach it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

B00BI745AA|3.0|Every aspect of this film is excellent, but I personally couldn't get past the decision to shoot everything handheld and close up. It made the actors' performances very intimate, yes, but it also made the pacing relentless and left me exhausted. An extremely well-made film nonetheless, but that technical decision was off-putting for me.

B001KZG99A|4.0|Not only is this the best Iron Man film, but it's one of the best in the superhero genre. It single-handedly establishes the tone and aesthetics of the entire Marvel film universe.

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I knew going into this movie that the reviews weren't stellar, but then again, I'm not a movie snob.  I'll watch anything once.  I thought the movie was pretty good.  It's not Oscar material or even life-altering, but I didn't think it was a waste of my time either.  I actually thought the only thing that detracted from the movie were the few times the f-word was used: it seemed forced and used more as a habit than because it was necessary to the story.  I think I would have better used the creature, Edward, story-wise but overall - I'll watch it every now and then.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|EXCELLENT--NO PROBLEMS--THANKS
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Other reviews have gone into depth, so let me keep this short.  Each actor's performance is dead-on. The story is extremely well written, funny, and poignant.  The tie-ins with what we know about these characters in the future are done well.  At the day, this movie shows why I love superhero stories.
0446572993|3.0|I was going to by his latest book but this was so weak; I'll wait until its free or very very cheap<br />,
B008D36INE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I finished this movie.  I've always been a fan of Weisz and Beale, and I'm quickly becoming a fan of Hiddleston.  Yes, the majority of the movie is depressing, and yes, it may be considered mostly a \\"chick flick\\" since we are in Hester's head for the story; however, this movie deals with some hardcore emotions and life-revelations, and it does so in an intelligent and unsympathetic way. I was moved by the trio's performances and how the director unfolds the story, bringing it in a complete circle by the end.  I'm always appreciative of these types of movies and performances because it allows us to examine - safely through the camera's lens - reflections of some of our less \\"savory\\" motives and emotions.  In the end, the message is hopeful without being unrealistic.  Well done.
0812981448|5.0|Reading this book feels like having a meaningful conversation; it's an easy read but full of wisdom. Mycoskie's concept has resulted in a successful marriage of capitalism and charity so his words are worth listening to.  I recommend this book for anyone who has any sort of passion on any topic. This is a great book for business-minded people to be inspired that nice guys don't always finish last.  It's an equally great resource for people strongly drawn to non-profit work/volunteering.<br /><br />The heart of \\"Start Something That Matters\\" is its commitment to doing things the right way no matter what, being patient and action oriented, and maintaining humility.  Mycoskie wants people to have tools to contribute no matter where they are and no matter what their interests are, and he provides tons of free resources for them to do so.  Several stories of start-up companies and organizations are sprinkled throughout the book, so pretty much any personality type can find encouragement and inspiration in its pages.  I'm not the quickest reader, but I read this book in less than 24 hours....couldn't put it down!

As a certified massage therapist, I am fully aware of how relaxing ambient music, rolling waves, spa music, etc. can be and how it can help to lull you to sleep.

B00CB4ET0K|2.0|The program would not open after being downloaded.  In fact, I could not find it in the downloads! Works fine on my iPhone, though.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This is the best gaming headset so far from TB (Turtle Beach). I've used the headset for a bit and its awesome so far i can listen to music from my phone and there's no wires and I mean<br />NO WIRES!!! It's the best headset I've use in my whole life! (Btw you also don't need WiFi for the headset to work witch = EPIC!)
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I recently found this series after searching for the actor in the new Star Trek movie. My only complaint is that I wish there was a season 3!
B000V659OU|5.0|even if you didn't hear a single sound in the movie, the aesthetic quality is absolutely amazing, such a dreamy magical story!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Might work better on a tablet.  I had trouble finding the active area on the screen for my smart phone.  The game wouldn't always let me pick up items or enter numbers on the locks.
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|when you don't feel like thinking, but want something feel good that actually has a plot and a great sound track...
B008XHABUQ|1.0|Took me two years to get my hands on this book and one week to finish it. This book was not erotic! Half the stuff they did was a typical Wednesday night for me.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|practically impossible to find in the U.S. so ordering it is kind-of a must if you want to see it, but definitely worth it if you like thinking! :O)
B00C061I3K|3.0|When I first heard &#34;Get Lucky&#34;, I inmediately thought that the whole album would have the same kind of rithm, but I was wrong: the rest of the songs are pretty slow... I know that this happens to lots of people...we end up buying something with high expectations, and when we get the product, well....you know what I mean :)<br />But hey, thats my opinion. I like more bpms...my bad.<br /><br />I guess this is still a &#34;must have&#34; album for people who love Daft Punk.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The plot was good and the characters well developed.  However, the spelling, punctuation, grammar and misuse of words (bare/bear, etc.) and especially the run-on sentences nearly drove me nuts by the end of the book.  This book needs some serious, meticulous editing.
1439153663|5.0|It was a wonderful novel that was powerfully written and made me appreciate what the slaves endured. I could not put it down<br />it was painful and sad to read but absolutely wonderful.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|I deleted this app because it didn't work on my Kindle Fire. Oh well. It was just practice for downloading apps.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Good movie, good plot.  Had to see it twice in order to sort out all the characters. Touching and humorous.
B00CTJ7K1M|5.0|This is a must watch tv show of all time. If you like action then you will love this tv show. Just watch the first episode and you will know how awesome is this tv show.
B00C2IN7CG|5.0|These days, the Tim Burton Batman movies can be overshadowed by either the colossal success of the Nolan films or the abysmal failure of the Schumacher pictures. Batman Returns is even often overlooked in favor of the 1989 movie. Having said that, this is probably one of the darker Batman offerings in cinema. The penguins sinister plot to kidnap and murder the first born of Gotham would easily earn this Movie an R rating these days. The acting is great. The visuals are as iconic as its predecessor. I love the steel book art, and the original VHS cover is represented on the back side.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|It's been years since I read such a great book. I didn't want it to end, it held me completely !!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's a dictionary very efficient and has helped me with homework and I can easily look up words when I'm reading. You can't deny that it has a great variety of words.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Package came with all DVDs unharmed. Very entertaining season of Game of Thrones.  I paid $30 for the disks and it was definitely worth the price.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is perfect for anyone who is interested in ww2.you have fully functional weapons minus firing real bullets.Over all get this game now!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|this book was a great read. the story flows seamlessly between the present mis-adventures of the 100 year old man and his incredible mis-adventures through his 100 years. it is full of humour and light-heartedness that will also give you perspective onto what really matters in life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game but I think it should have a button to get help if your stuck but<br />Bedside that its an Amazing game I recommend this game I think about ages 8 and up you should love it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun until level 4 where I could not grab the keys and move on I was looking forward to the rest of the levels but I guess I can only play 4 levels that I can solve in 10 seconds a bit of disappointment for me but I recommend the game but hopefully you can get further than just 4 levels
B000FC146C|5.0|I SAW THE MOVIE SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT NEVER READ THE BOOK, AS USUAL, THE BOOK IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|It was easy to listen to.  I had never heard anything like it and found it to be very interesting.
0761169253|5.0|Nothing earth shattering, more like a good reminders of how to live.  Finished it during 'no electronics' time on Flight.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I liked the way this book ended for Sookie.  Sookie came to realize that the vampires are self serving creatures.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I haven't had any problems.  No turning is required. The pieces are already in the correct rotation.  All pieces can be inserted...some need to be tapped harder than others.
0205632645|5.0|There is no argument against it. This book should be on the desk of any writer who wishes to be proficient in form.
0345536886|4.0|I've always been a Grisham fan, especially his prolific early Trifecta' of \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", and \\"A Time to Kill\\".  I was pretty disappointed in \\"Good 'Ole Grisham\\" last year, though, after reading \\"The Associate\\", which seemed more like a means for Grisham to sell a few million more books than a true attempt at a legal thriller.  \\"The Litigators\\", though, firmly established Grisham back on the right track.<br /><br />The book had a funnier tone than some of the other recent Grisham novels.  I also appreciated that Grisham took the time to develop multiple storylines (some weaker than others), rather than sticking to following one character almost exclusively (as he did in \\"The Associate\\").<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this book as a good summer read by the pool - I read it on my Kindle and really enjoyed it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this. It wasn't so hard, just had to think though. I really enjoyed. Can't wait for more levels.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|One of the few compelling Tom Cruise characters that I've seen in a long while.  Well written with the feel of old film noir detective stories.  Personally I'd rather watch Bogart but Cruise manages to make the character come to life so it is efinitely not a watch once movie.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Movie is great, so buying it on blu-ray was a must.<br />The special features section is nice, if you're into that.<br />My copy came with a DVD version and digital copy.<br />Reedem that code ASAP!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I strongly recommend this DVD.  The Royal Albert Hall is beautiful & this performance was magnificent.  The appearance of Andrew Lloyd Weber & Michael Crawford was icing on the cake.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Definitely a movie you will watch more than once, probably not back-to-back.<br />But definitely sets your feet back on the ground.<br /><br />Blu-ray quality is good and my copy came with the DVD and digital copy.
0439875889|5.0|great set, my daughter loves it. she is a llama llama fan. and enjoys the set of cd and book.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|this is a terrific CD, I purchased it for my daughter and she listens to it all the time, really!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|constantly dangles rewards that you can only get if you buy pearls for real money. not worth the time. doesn't Disney have enough money already?
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|Finally Black Sabbath comes back together to make music in the only way they can as a group and they do not disappoint at all! Worth the wait!
B005ES0Z9O|5.0|I have been wearing crocs for many years and I really like these new sport crocs.  Very comfortable.  I highly recommend!
B0091THRCU|5.0|I love this product.....it is exactly what I wanted....no belt clip, no bulky covers, etc.....<br /><br />For those that put their iPhones in their pockets......this is it!!!
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Maybe it's because Dave's a born-again christian. Maybe it's because the record company pressured him into releasing an album earlier than he wanted to. Maybe it's the fact that it has Distrubed's singer on here as a vocal guest. Or maybe, (and more likely,) it's simply the fact that this CD is devoid of any sort of creativity or, for the love of Ronnie James Dio, HEAVYNESS that makes Megadeth loved by millions. Whatever the cause, this CD indefinitely, and absolutely, BLOWS. Like a whale.<br /><br />What a shallow CD. Banjo parts? The lyrics themselves are extra sharp cheese. They'll make you curl your toes in dissapointment at just how bad they are. Someone stated in another review that they were stolen from a High school metal band, and I cannot agree more.<br /><br />Dave needs to wake up. He needs to quit the Christian bulls***, and get back to writing face melting albums. With actual, AWESOME solos. Whatever it takes. Getting angry, doing drugs, booze, whatever. Because a mere hangover is a small price to pay when you're able to MELT FACES on a daily basis. Unless Daves quits pissing around, Megadeth will be no more. They will simply morph into a lesser being, known by many as MEH-GADETH.<br /><br />Dave must've been trying to offer his fans something good, but it simply turned out horrific. I'm not even sure if he tried. It's almost as if, to quote a certain cartoon show, he simply said; \\"Hey, we got your favorite thing: DISSAPOINTMENT.\\"<br /><br />Many hearts will be broken when this CD is listened to. Many dollars will be wasted. And many, many more fans will be compelled to either stop listening to MEH-GADETH entirely, or tell Dave to get his crap together. Maybe, just maybe, if all the fans got together and told him off, he'd listen. After all, this album, I predict, (and hope,) will be a financial disaster. I read somewhere that a certain torrent site has about 400 seeders of the album illegally uploaded, with thousands of downloads. Perhaps it's for thebest.<br /><br />1 smoldering pile of metal CD's devoid of heavyness out of 5.
0007430671|5.0|I've been reading Mr Cornwell for many years. Few historical novelists have grown successively better with each undertaking. In my younger days I was thrilled by the Richard Sharpe adventures. However, &#34;The Saxon Tales&#34;,<br />&#34;Agincourt&#34; and &#34;1356&#34; exhibit how he continues to get better over time.
1594201927|3.0|I have almost completed reading this fairly exhaustive recount of the advent and progress of money in human society. Well written except for some unneeded verbosity specially in regard to a Scotsman who figured in the history of finances. The author is a Scot and he had to simply add those pages because of his Scottish pride but allocating a full 30 pages to him is sure to bore almost all of us including some Scotsmen. I skipped it after the first 5 pages. That's why I don't remember that character's name.<br />The rest of the story telling is informative. Loved to read about the concept of that article of exchange, money, when bartering was slowly abandoned in its favor over the centuries. I have yet to read the concluding chapter and hoping it will put it all together neatly to make the reading memorable.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|It's like I'm a drill bursting into the heavens TENGAN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN!<br /><br />JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!!!!
B007EECSFA|4.0|This book kept me guessing the whole way through.  I loved the period & mystery.  I wish we all could go back and find out what our parents were up to when they were young.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Didn't realize that such a fairy tale title would turn into such a gory film.  Good story, great action, awesome movie for family with preteens.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you enjoy 100 Floors or the old computer games Mystic and Riven, definitely give this a try. The first few floors are not terribly difficult.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Ok movie! A better actor than Franco maybe would've made it a better movie. Everyone else out-shined the star!  Good for fantasy flick overall tho.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love hidden object and puzzle type games. This kept me thinking and totally engaged. A ton of entertainment for not a lot of cost. Well worth it!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good show....still watching....Sort of like the soap operas of old My husband even got interested in it and watched most of it with me
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pe is the best game in the world and it is totoly worth the 7 bucks. You have to get it!!!!
0375869026|4.0|I got this book just two days ago, and I could not put it down! The story revolves around a ten year old boy named August, aka Auggie. He has a gene that made his face \\"abnormal,\\" and he has been homeschooled all throughout his young life. Soon, his parents send him to public school (after some disagreement,) and he faces 5th grade, encountering some jerks, some friends, and some \\"neutrals.\\" I could definitely see a 5th grader saying this, but I would like it even more if the protagonist was more mature, around 12-18 years old. However, you could see all the trouble that Auggie goes through, and your heart does reach out for the little guy. The sentences were well written, and you could believe that it was a young boy talking, and not an old man. :) I didn't really like the fact that (about halfway through the book,) the author switched from a POV to another POV to yet another point of view. I didn't really like Justin's part, but only because my eyes and my mind have a hard time processing the incorrect sentences, with no capitalization or quotation marks. I just wish that the author made the characters' parts longer, instead of switching so fast, like from August to Miranda to Via/Olivia. But I did like the fact that we could see what went on in Miranda's and Via's mind, and what they thought about Auggie. I only had 2 \\"problems not problems\\" with the book, and I loved it! I highly recommend this book to teens and adults alike!
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Good idea, and fun to play, but the controls are very glitchy. after the 5th round, I kept having my car fly forward when I tried to turn. It did this at the same spot each time no matter what I was doing (even leaving the phone alone). This continued on a couple of other levels as well, which made it very frustrating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. Please add more levels quick...I'm hooked! Awesome game and challenging. Got stuck on a few levels too.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|great insite into history that i thought i knew! ! I loved the people and wanted to know what happened to them.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Amazing book. I was enthralled from beginning to end. I have been reading this series for 4 years now and can say that this was one of the most satisfying endings to a series I have ever read
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have always been a voracious reader. Why I was never required to read Sherlock  Holmes in all my years of being a student is unimaginable and an oversight in public education.<br />Reading this book has opened my eyes to an incredible writer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Watching television mysteries it is obvious that the methods of deduction seem to be taken directly from this master.<br />Each story is entertaining and a great study into the mind of SHERLOCK HOLMES through his dear truest friend Dr. Watson.<br />It is the beginning of summer and I cannot think of a better read than this complete works.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am 28 years old and I have never read an entire book in my life and this is the first on that kept my attention and I actually finished in 3 days. I definitely recommend it and I an about to buy the next one an start it :)
B00AJER3SE|4.0|The action is great but it does not have a good storyline. It is not one of my favorites but I will watch it again.
B00BUT5I84|2.0|When I think of 30STM, I think in Buddha for Mary. I think in Echelon. I think in Capricorn.<br /><br />From this new album, all I can remember is the song in the title. The rest of the album looks like Coldplay, and this is a offense.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This is one of My favorites. I have watched almost all of John Wayne's movies. I never get tired of them.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This definetely has make the purchase worth. Thomas and Guy created the songs that will accompany me to the rest of my life. I mean, from the moment I pressed PLAY until the last moments of CONTACT, I traveled to the 70's in a spiral of funky spirit, fun and shining discos.
0880796863|4.0|Aim Clairvoyant & have E.S.P. so I wanted to get into reading the Tarot cards for people. The cards are the best the book that I would need a magnifying glass to read is terrible.So when we get to my next order we will see how I fixed that problem!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is a great app for all your basic photo needs. It has fixes, filters, and you can even draw on the photos! Overall, it's a great app and is completely worth it.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I bought this because my daughter wanted to see this because of all the Monsters U advertisements on TV. My three year old loved it, and that is a true measure of this movie's appeal. It is a great family watchable movie worth repeated watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun. The graphics are realistic and the horses are too. This app is perfect for horse lovers who don't have a horse but want the thrill of taking care of one, even though she is virtual.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Funny, engaging, and full of little gems which can be talked about long after the movie is over. Its a great movie for little kids, even though the beginning had a little scary moment.
B00BY8DC2A|5.0|The Heavies are back! Really great album with old-skool dance tracks with a touch of soul in it. Really recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a  easy to use calculator with big  numbers. It's doesn't have all the other stuff you probably won't use.
0770435726|4.0|Brief Summary<br />Kate Moore had quite a past as a C.I.A. operative, but now, with two kids, she's trying to settle down.  But when her husband decides to move them to Luxemburg, her past life begins to catch up to her-and she soon begins to realize that maybe her husband's past is not as innocent as she once thought.<br /><br />The Tsundoku Scale<br />Middle of the Pile (7 out of 10).<br /><br />The Good<br />This novel is built to be a thriller, from the flashy black and red hued color, to the typical secret-laced C.I.A. operative story line-and yet no one dies, the main character is a stay at home mom, and the husband is more or less a geek.  It is uniquely different from what one would expect, and I could not help but find myself liking the book because of that.  The story is brilliantly constructed, taking place in three different time periods (the present, two years before, and deep in Kate's C.I.A. past), without ever confusing the reader about what happened when, and bringing all the story lines together in a fulfilling, revealing end.  Though the story gets a little slow at times, the ending culmination of hidden secrets, backstabbing, and good old betrayal, is well worth the wait. What's more, Kate is a very real, very human, character in the story.  She is not obnoxiously confident, makes mistakes, wants more for her children and herself, and is constantly on edge about the lies she has to tell.  The story is not just full of surprising secrets, but is surprisingly deep in how it relates Kate's life as a normal, everyday person.<br /><br />The Bad<br />Spy novels can often be, to put it mildly, just a little unrealistic with the back-flipping, gun-toting characters who seem to survive anything.  But we're ok with that because it's fun-after all, it is entertaining.  But The Expats has the opposite problem.  In trying to make Kate so human, so much like typical mom trying to balance her family life, it becomes incredulous how unbelievably dim-witted she can be.  Understandably she's retired, but how could a successful C.I.A. operative who has been in missions all over the world and killed numerous people, not remember to put gloves on before breaking into an apartment?  How could any reasonable person think that it would be a good idea to investigate her husband literally right before he comes into the house?  Or not look out for a security camera when snooping around?  These are the kind of simple rookie mistakes that Kate makes ALL THE TIME, and though what she figures out at the end kind of makes up for some of these mishaps, it can't fully erase her annoyingly naïve approach to spying.
B003WKOU0G|3.0|I was disappointed with the lack of verbal language. Just songs till the end. It could have been better if it had dialogues and explanations. I got bored sometimes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy but challenging it holds your attention, they need to make more levels, level 10 kinda got me thinking  so purchase this game
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I haven't liked Adobe reader from day one, but in resent years they have improved things such as editing options for free, and mobile options, however better pdf viewers and editors have come out and in comparison Adobe Reader doesn't stack up at all.  I have also attempted to reach their customer service on multiple occasions because of issues that Reader has caused on my system, such as it's memory allocation and garbage collection breaking and not working forcing me to do a memory dump is just unacceptable.  Time is money and this product has wasted a large portion of my time.
B000G2AHUA|4.0|After not having much luck with Sperry and some others (sizes varied a lot) was pleased that these shoes fit right - the 10 M fit just right to my 10 D foot.  Seem to be well constructed.  Maybe not a shoe to be walking a long time in, because you can feel the lugs thru the sole (thus one star down)  But for a pair of shoes to wear out with jeans or khakis, these fit the bill.  Service from Amazon was excellent.
1423101499|5.0|Accurate description of book and condition.  Fast, easy, prompt delivery.  I have no problem recommending this to anyone who is looking for this book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. It's like owning your own horse with out the hard Labour and smelly horse droppings!
B008M721MS|2.0|Skype is a wonderful tool, and the paid susbcriptions are worth the investment, however the version installed in the Kindle Fire HD does not allow adding people/contacts/phones to a call.<br /><br />I was told by SKYPE technicians that the Kindle Fire HD Version does not have the same functionality as does the Android application (in spite of what this page - and others - say).  It is June 2013, 7 months after the Fire HD came out, and they haven't solved the bug???<br /><br />Its a shame that SKYPE for the Kindle Fire HD is not as capable as other SKYPE versions.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|The characters were so compelling and real to me. I couldn't put it down, read all night! I recommended this to my sister and she loved it too.
B008J05EL8|1.0|It refuses to open in my Kindle Fire HD, I plan to return it tomorrow.  I hate products that don't work as advertised, specially if I have to pay for something that should be part of the OfficeSuite.  Maybe I should return them both....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I THINK THEY ONLY MADE 10 rooms to start with to see if people will like it.WE DO! more,more,more. It is funand challenging

B007W4OZ76|2.0|Though it promises to allow you to see your dropbox files, it simply does not, and it can get confusing because it shows even more details than Windows Explorer.  Sadly, the Kindle Fire HD seems to be full of empty folders, according to this software.
B009FZFONO|5.0|More action. More suspense. We really enjoyed this season more than the first two. The characters in this season are much more complex, it seems. Cannot wait for the fourth season!
B007RQ6WCA|2.0|Tried installing it and found  the Ant Tek Explorer doesn't show the Dropbox anywhere...  I have to add mo.  Downloading from DropBox.com, while logged in, installs it in the Kindle Fire HD so that OfficeSuite can access the DropBox directory.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very good app for kids. It doesn't freeze or stop working in the middle of you playing it. The best app I have.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good.because the levels take some thought but arent too bizarre that you cant figure it out.  Much better than the 99 level equivalent.  I like you dont have to shake or flip your phone to figure out a puzzle, qt least not yet.

B004UC4HCG|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first, but this baby is the perfect size for two hard drives and a Blue Ray RW drive.  I loaded it up with:<br /><br />Intel Core i3-2130 Dual-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 3 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80623I32130<br /><br />SanDisk 64 GB Solid State Drive with Low Power Consumption SDSSDP-064G-G25  and 2.5-inch SSD/Hard Drive to 3.5-inch Bay Plastic Tray Mount Adapter Kit<br /><br />Corsair XMS3 4 GB 1333MHz PC3-10666 240-pin DDR3 Memory Kit for Core i3 i5 i7 and CMX4GX3M1A1333C9<br /><br />all bought from Amazon and a Blueray RW drive and Windows 7 from Fry's Electronics.  I was going to build the system myself, but then I realized I had forgotten to buy an operating system for it.  So I went to Fry's to buy Windoze (I prefer Linux but we are stuck with Itunes) and noticed they had a cheap deal on a system build.  Had them build it cuz I'm an amateur.<br /><br />Man, putting Windows on an SSD makes it FLY.  Dunno if the processor had anything to do with it either.... but man, from power off to Windows fully loaded in 15 seconds, no kidding.  I am amazed.<br /><br />This case is great, stock fans are pretty quiet, and I am going to be able to fit this into a cabinet with a lot of room to spare.  Great HTPC case!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|There isn't much to this game.  If I'm stuck on a plane or need something to pass time, this will do it, but you feel like there is no real sense of accomplishment or success.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|I guess it is time for ole Bruce to stick to producing or directing.  Do not get in front of the camera.
0345529057|5.0|so far, the story follows the TV series.  New added information which adds to the plots.  Great read.<br />Would buy more.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|So touching!  Great lessons for all of us to learn.  I didn't hear much about it until it was already on TV.
1427233748|5.0|excellent reader makes this one of the best audio books I've bought in a while.  Made for very pleasant driving -- even sat in the car for 10 minutes to hear the end!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This movie will keep your attention there is nothing boring in this movie, maybe that's because of Clint Eastwood. This is quite funny but also a little sad. Clint has always put out his share of good movie to watch, and this is one of them.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked the generation aspect of the book,but with so many different characters I had to keep going by to refresh my mind as to who they were and how they connected to the main character,which I never was sure who that was. But the story was very good and held my interest. I also felt like I got a sense of the country and conditions and the things that were important to the people.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I liked this movie because it was based on the truth. I feel everyone ought ta know just how it was back in those days. I felt the acting was great also. I bought the soundtrack because I felt it fit the movie quite well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a great game. They`'ve  added braziers, something like a fragile tightrope with bricks, and a little extra surprise for mining areas.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I've seen so many movies, many good and, of course, many bad.  Generally, they don't make movies like they used to.  But this is probably the best movie I have ever seen.  I was so sad when it ended.  It did not at all seem like three hours.  It candidly suggests how one act can make a profound difference in the future for all.  It is horrific for me to even imagine that African-Americans were treated as slaves.  However, some people decided enough was enough and traversed outside of the norm to alter how society functions, for good or for bad.  And I have yet to see a movie with the picture quality of this one.  Just see it.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I'm a good eater and yet struggle with weight gain.  Dr. Davis' analysis of the wheat in our food supply makes sense.  Thank you for presenting new facts giving consumers more choices in our daily diet.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie but I found it to be too long and very disjointed.  Once again Tom Hanks feels the need to spin politics into the movie (in a very subtle way).  I found the book to be more entertaining.  While the movie was very well filmed, I struggled to make it to the end.  No more Hanks for me, I'm afraid.  I watch movies to have fun.  This was not fun and I did not find it to be thought provoking (unless you consider the fact that I was wondering why I was wasting so much time watching it).  Nuff said.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Basically what this game is very fun! Great graphics! Definitely worth playimng if you like iron man and temple run,
1582406723|5.0|This comic book was delivered in perfect condition! I did very gently read it, then slid it back into it protective cover. I'm hoping to get more very soon! Amazon.com is where I always go first!

B00C061HZY|4.0|Love this album. I love that Daft Punk changed up the electronic game by going back to live instrumentation and a funky groove
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I probably was assigned this in college once upon a time, but would have found it too gushy at the time. Glad I read it when I did.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is a good family movie.<br />Fun for all ages and nothing to have explain.<br /><br />We all liked it.
B005OK721G|4.0|THE VIDEO WAS VERY GOOD, IT HAD EVERY THING THAT I EXPECTED. ALSO I MUST SAY AGAIN IT WAS VERY GOOD
B004LWZWGK|4.0|It was an amazing movie in the theater and just as good in Blu-Ray. I give it only 4 stars because some of the scenes did get drawn out a bit and I wanted to reserve 5-star ratings for only the best movies.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Despite all of the hype over Yeezus, this album is probably one of the best of the year. I have been listening to it non-stop. From the swelling sounds in Villuminati all the way to the smooth ending of Sparks Will Die, I absolutely love this album. Definitely the must have album of the year and it will definitely be in heavy rotation for the summer.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Jeremy Renner is great in this. It keeps you drawn in the whole movie. The price is great. I can't wait to watch it again!
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Let me first begin by saying I have never once contributed a review to a product on Amazon. I've purchased thousands of items without ever feeling the need to describe the purchase. This album has shown me the error of my ways.<br /><br />It's been a long, long time since I came upon an album that surprised me as much as this one. I actually first heard of this band in their \\"Haunt\\". I had forgotten of them until I heard \\"Pompeii\\" on a random internet radio channel. Immediately I searched and saw that they had released their \\"Bad Blood\\" album. Unfortunately it hasn't released in the US yet but having just moved to Australia I was able to purchase it.<br /><br />Dan's voice is just beyond brilliant in every aspect on this album. As some have said, there's not a song on this album I will skip, not one, even after numerous repeat listens. The songs are so layered and Dan's voice just ties everything together perfectly. The sound seems new and fresh yet at the same time familiar. It's incredible. I will be seeing them on tour soon and cannot wait. Top album of 2013 for me by a mile.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|not bad so far. I do wish it was slightly more interactive, but it was free so who can complain?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is interesting,gives a new understanding as to the Responsibility it takes to care for an animal. Defiantly fun and interestingly entertaining. Would recommend to others for sure.w
B00006LLNV|5.0|A great intro to some different types and artists of traditional Mexican folk music, maybe a little flamenco, classical guitar, and music written for the movie. Uplifting, heartfelt, mellifluous, melodious. Makes one feel like dancing and singing.
081297381X|3.0|A bit tedious for the few interesting points the author makes. Author needs a strong editor or more self disciplined writing.
145210655X|5.0|Well made hardcover book. Quality materials, high detail, and funny with close references to the movie.  Made a unique Father's Day gift.
159420411X|5.0|Well written and raises many points that have useful applications to everyday life as well as to business. Use his thought process daily.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app.  I travel often and my watch doesn't have an alarm.  And the cell phone clock/alarm can't be seen unless I hit a button on the phone.  But this alarm clock app is perfect.  And I like the fact that I can set whatever music I want to wake up to.  Definitely worth the 99&cent;, or coins.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The app wouldn't install on my kindle fire so therefore it is bad but the other reveiws said it was good I could tell you the truth if it was good or not but it wont install for me sorry
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Nice very nice game. Recommend it. It is light and fast. Good graphics also, I was impressed with the quality
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Awesome movie, love the story line. great choice in actors, Josh is Awesome and Julianne is in good form. Intence
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|Movies based on books are usually lousy as you feel you're missing something for things to make sense or paint the full picture.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out.<br />It was pretty good but was a little disappointed.<br />Not his best work.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker is an underappreciated talent.  I know its his voice within a couple of notes.  Hearing him makes me smile.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|fun movie with great music!  Fun to watch with friends...especially as a sing along.  My kids watched it more than once!
B0052Z0MJW|4.0|All the elements we have come to associate with Dan Brown are there. Some codes must be understood and some dire threat averted by people who need all their ingenuity to survive, all in about 24 hours. Chapters are short, language simple and suspense builds in no time. There are some normal folk we can relate to, some horrific baddies intent on evil, and one that seems to mutate from one to the other. It is a typical suspenseful thriller.<br /><br />This one is set in a high tech US Military base and also Spain in the 1990s. While the plot twists and turns like strands of spaghetti, we get a glimpse into life in the computer world, the long anti-social hours of the era in a sterile environment like nothing in the outside world and caricatures of people we might meet. There are those who rise to senior management with people skills as well as technical smarts and with good coping skills. And others with technical ability who lack common sense; these floundered in real world situations and were actually vulnerable. Some high achievers in this project-driven world have an obsessive desire to achieve their given assignments and tasks, including self imposed ones. And there is an introduction to the language that the commercial release of the internet brought to the world; concepts like secure encoding for email messages, security software to keep out virus and worms, key loggers, plus chips, stats and more. And how much money could be made from developing such software. Well painted Mr. Brown.<br /><br />Woven into the plot is a disaffected Japanese employee who has been sacked. He wants the world to know that this base has the ability to spy on any email, even though it is only those who attract adverse attention that they have the capacity to deal with. A theme here is the concern about individual privacy that was surfacing in the 1990s. He devises an ingenious way to hold his old employers to ransom, but dies in Spain too soon to give them deliverance. He makes a dying gesture, a sign. A professor, engaged to one of the cryptographers, is hired to go to Spain and retrieve his belongings. Soon he is a hunted man who needs all his ingenuity to survive. I loved the way he cheats death here, despite repeatedly hopeless odds; the sort of thing that brings howls of laughter from today's moviegoers faced with similar situations in early film noir. And the descriptions of the interesting places, such as Santa Cruz and nearby Seville Cathedral with the tomb of Christopher Columbus, that he moves through on his flight  through Seville. He is an early prototype for Robert Langdon folks.<br /><br />Back at the base the bodies mount with the suspense. As they clarify what they are dealing with, having bypassed the obvious and ignored repeated common sense observations, the motives of various characters become clear to us. Disaster strikes, but the heroine escapes to save the day. There are some brief humorous interludes, but also a very touching one explaining that our disaffected worker was Japanese and deformed as a result of radiation to his mother from the American bombs that ended WWII. He was disowned by his father at birth because he was considered to bring dishonour to the family. Yet he passed all employment checks and had no animosity towards America.<br /><br />Yes, it was generally formulaic, but nevertheless I enjoyed it. A light read, reasonably well done and an interesting change from my usual tastes.ng gesture, a sign.

B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I got hooked to American Horror Story during season 1 but season 2 left me perplexed in the beginning.  I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it as much.  I still liked the story and eventually looked forward to watching it...season 1 is still my favorite so far.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun puzzle game, super addictive but definitely needs more levels (level ten was a little ridiculous). Left wanting more!
B002GHHHL0|5.0|Love the movie and wanted to replace VHS. It is terrific!Just as advertised. Good service. Thanks I will be coming back for more
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Just about as interesting taking care of a real horse. I would recommend this game for anyone who loves horses.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|There is nothing I can add to all who have written before me.  This is a must-see for everyone--a true classic.  Perfectly done!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it. it was just challenging enough for me. I. do not like it to be so hard I cant figure it out
1451695195|5.0|The first 148 pages were well crafted, a compellingly told story that was engaging throughout. THEN on page 149, the author took a different approach...and attempted to create a thorough and rigorous theoretical explanation for his Near-Death experience (NDE). This is where he hits it out of the ballpark in my opinion. Eben Alexander takes all his skepticism, honors it, and explores his NDE from a variety of vantage points. It doesn't matter if you believe in his experience, and doesn't matter if you believe or follow his theoretical analysis....what is beautiful is his openness to exploring the possibility of an afterlife (or continuation of life). I have huge respect for how he has languaged and crafted his experiences.

B003XDZLTG|5.0|Thanks so much to other reviews who shared the dryer trick! I am an 8.5 with a widish foot. Bought these in a 9 and they were too big by about .50 inch in length. I think the 8 would have been short. Wet with warm water and put in the dryer on high for about 10 minutes, put them on while warm and they will mold to your foot. They shrank about .50 inch in length and a bit around the sides and now fit perfectly. The straps, which were too loose also shrank to perfect but could also be stretched while warm.You can stretch anywhere. Set your timer, do not go more than 10 minutes at first. The pairs that I bought were exactly the same as this newer model but the heel strap is also movable ( like the one over the arch). I did this with both brown and light aqua ones. Dryer appears to shrink by about a half size. Brown were larger to begin with. Too funny! So for half size I would try going up and using the dryer to customize. LOVE these, they are even more airy and light than my old original cayman clog style (which are now in the dryer because they stretched a lot over the yrs and are now even more clownish) :-)<br /><br />Edit: I used the dryer again to customize the fit after the initial \\"adjustment\\". You can stretch where needed if you put in the dryer for a short time - about 5 min on high (just enough to heat them up). This includes the straps, width etc but not the length. Consistent sizing would really help among the models but at least you can get a closer fit.
0385474547|2.0|I chose this book because I did not know this renowned African writer, but he is no Bessie Head or Marimba Ba. He is writing from a patriarchal perspective and his language is very sexist. He does not distance himself from the sexist customs and the sexist society he describes.<br /><br />I would not recommend the book but recommend African women writers instead.
0670000337|2.0|The listing for this book indicated it was in very good condition.

B004LWZW7E|5.0|Talk about class warfare! In a world where time LITERALLY is money, living from paycheck to paycheck is a dangerous proposition indeed. Very well done. You'll never look at the working poor the same way.

B00004XMTJ|3.0|The cameras bounce all over the place.<br /><br />It's not bad, but seeing Cats in theatre is always better than any dvd/video could ever do.<br /><br />I actually got it because my daughter loves music and she asks for the &#34;dancing kitties&#34; all the time. If I put it on I rarely actually sit and watch it, it's more just for the music to be played as I do things about the house.
0007119550|5.0|I didn't even order the book and the money was taken from my account, this has nothing to do with the book and it was brilliant to read!!!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|So I hate when people review a movie based on how they felt about the book...so I did read the series, I did rent the movie because of reading the books, but I will not combine the way I felt about both. It took me a few hours short of the 48 hour rental period to actually finish the movie. I felt it was, for lack of a better word, boring. I do feel that if you haven't read the book, there are a lot of things that wouldn't make sense...if you did read the book, there are a lot of pieces missing. I would not watch it again...and if there happens to be a second one, I won't watch that either. The actors/actresses were great for their part. It was the movie in general that just sucked. For someone who never read the book...why are their eyes gold? Why are Lena's two colors? None of this was explained anywhere in the movie. It would have been a good movie if the movie had a plot...one that didn't hinge on the fact of whether or not you have read the series. If you have not read the book, give the movie a try...you will probably enjoy it. If you have read the book, watch it and at least you will be able to follow the story line...but DO NOT expect anything from  the book to carry over because you will be very disappointed. All in all, I gave it an Okay rating because it wasn't horrible and didn't deserve a one star rating....but it was just barely an Okay in my opinion. To some, I hope you enjoy it and to the others like me who didn't, sorry I feel your pain realizing you could have spent 2 hrs and 3 mins doing something better with your time.

B002JXK5VU|3.0|I enjoy Eureka for its creativity. The science used in the show is not totally fraudulent, which makes the fiction easier to swallow. It's not my favorite entertainment, but I enjoy watching it. We need more shows of this type.
B0013K1F32|5.0|love this CD, it's worth the price for good classics. Would recommend it to all those who love oldies but goodies.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had this game on my kindle fire and got soooooooooo far. I got the 10million score achievement. But then my fire broke. :(. However this game is so fun that I downloaded it on my new fire HD. Can't live without this game. Super addicting.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is just plain fun.<br /><br />The premise it clever and unique.<br /><br />I've spent many hours playing this over the last few weeks.<br /><br />I love the cute graphics.<br /><br />The achievements make it even more fun.<br /><br />I'd pay as much as 4 dollars probably for this game.<br /><br />A lot of users complain about the permissions.  Its true they suck.  But maybe it does help the developer keep the cost down.<br /><br />And there are no in app purchases or ads.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a good game but it can b  vert frustrating at times especially when the trains won't move and you het squished in between then!! #YOLO SWAG!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|I loved this book. Outin is exciting, engaging and fun at the same time. Nate's fascinating saga continues and Brandt Legg pulls us in right away with some big challenges for Nate and his friends. More challenges for the Movement as it grows and more surprises for us.<br />If you liked Outview you'll love Outin. If you haven't read Outview, read it first and then be like me and count the days until the final book comes out - hurry. You're going to love it!
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|It's a fun game for kids to see the process of having a garden. What timeline it needs to follow.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Hold On to your seat or should I say panties because you are in for one hell of a read when you enter this book of poetry. I would have to definitely say don't read this by yourself well you could but it wouldn't be any fun. Ladies grab your men and men grab your ladies  and head straight to the bedroom because that is exactly where you will end up at when you finish  this steamy exotic read. This poet has a real way with words and I would love to hear more from him. I could not possibly pick just one poem that I liked in this book because every last one was good to the last drop. I say drop because I was soak and wet upon finishing this book.<br /><br />Now Time for my favorite part that's right Q&A baby!!!<br /><br />1) How would I  rate this book on a scale of  1 to 5 ?<br />  I give it a 5 love the way the author took us too ecstasy<br /><br />2) Would I buy any other books from this author based off this one?<br />  Yes I would....<br /><br />3) Would I recommend this book to  my readers?<br />  If you are looking for something erotic then Yes.....
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game.  Objects move so it is not too easy but not so hard that I get stuck.
B00333NCTM|4.0|Book is honest and straight forward...  a good view of behind the scenes and his relationship with Sharon and his famuily
B0011E7JBW|5.0|I like how Will Smith acts in this movie as well as the others. I also like the graphics of the movie, it was awesome. The makeup artists were awesome at making this look so real. Great movie
B005RUV0NY|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Between this, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, AMC is the King of TV
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game.  Still want to play!  Need updates pretty please!  Why 25 words...this gets old and makes me not want to rate!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|getting ready to see the new star trek movie. really enjoyed seeing this again.<br />I was a huge star trek tv show fan but not so much the movies. this is the one that got me back on track with star trek!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This is a very long book and yet the author really did an amazing job at making the story keep you on the edge of your seat.  I don't recall ever reading a story which was so absolutely  amazing.
0525425764|5.0|i love the new character that John Grisham has created. I am a grandma and I really enjoy this series. Then I pass them on to my teen age friends and grandkids.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|We just got this game last night and OMG I can't put it down. The graphics are so life like it is so cool. If you like animals this is a must have!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This was the second time that I had seen this movie. I saw it first and then I read the book. I was pleased to see that the movie was even better after seeing the movie. I understood the back-story better.<br />Very seldom do I enjoy seeing a movie after I have read the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just the right amount of difficulty without being too hard. Could use a hint section though just in case every once in while you get stuck.
B0091WAWTM|5.0|We weren't sure if we wanted to continue watching it, as it wasn't what we thought it was going to be.  We just couldn't look away.  Cult classic, I'm sure.  We loved it.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I've loved this movie for years, and had to add it to my collection.  Robbins and Freeman give excellent performances, and the &#34;secret&#34; is awesome.
B0041T52S6|4.0|ok..I was playing around with a talking robot...Cleverbot... and I asked him what his favorite movie was...and he said...<br />Scott Pilgrim vs. the World<br />so...<br />I went out and bought it..and I REALLY liked it!
B000YABYLA|5.0|I had never heard of Ellen Page until I saw Juno.  I bought it because eveyone (including 2 of my daughters) was talking about it.  Wonderful combination of humor and sensitivity, and great character development.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|The game is fun and mysteries. :D it's cool how you have to find things and see we're they go.
B000I0QL82|4.0|The movie is typical of others from this era.  The music of Irving Berlin is wonderful, but I enjoyed watching Virginia Dale's dancing far more than &#34;lead&#34; Marjorie Reynold's.  Astaire's non-precision dancing was entertaining, but there's something I've never really liked about Bing Crosby (probably has something to do with his chauvinism).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This can  is fun I really like it cuz it's mysteries and I like how you have you find different things to escape. It show if you can handle your self if you had to escape from somewhere. :D
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|David Bowie is one of the great musicians of our time.  This album isn't.  It's good but lacks that something special.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I so enjoyed the latest series of music of a long time true musician of the heart & soul, Carlos Santana.
0374533555|4.0|Contrary to others who have commented that Kahneman's writing in this book is fluid and easy-to-grasp, I find that you frequently have to go through the pages slowly and come back to passages in Thinking Fast to fully get the messages, experiments, and 'drills' exposed. The tone still leans more for the academe than, for instance, a Gladwell crowd. But this is comparing just style and exposition--not substance, because this book indeed has so much more chutzpah in it than Blink (which is a good book for comparison, due to the two books' overlapping themes).<br /><br />It could indeed be rewarding for the reader to finish this 500-pager. The 'lessons' it wants to put forth are solid and sincere in their want to make the reader a better decision maker. If one can just be consciously aware of the biases that is natural to the human mind even 20% of the time, I can imagine the payoff in the arena of business and in personal relationships. Straight applications from investment to 'simple choices'/'daily-life' decision-making  are also peppered throughout the book's pages.<br /><br />The book is undoubtedly generous. The author seems to want to cram in one book all his life's work, he even elected to put the two groundbreaking articles that won him a Nobel (with a co-author). If you are on the sidelines trying to decide if you want to invest time in this book, I suggest you read these two appendices first. If they grabbed your interest, found them potentially profitable, and more so (at the most ideal) understood them in one reading, then the whole book will be rewarding for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game I've ever had. It is so cool with it's blocky  world ,animals, and mobs. MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Another movie that if they would've showed me when I was in high school I would've pass with a high grade . Sad but a must see for those who hate to read actual facts about a president .

B00AA7O22U|2.0|If it wasn't for all the cast members this movie would not take off . But it's still a great dude movie
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I liked this movie a lot.  It made the laugh, I thought the two main characters had great chemistry together, I thought the movie was charming.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|You have to see to understand . Ethan Hawk as always find himself in some awkward situation . Be on he's control . I think he like playing the victim too much .
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I was astounded when my 4th grade class had never seen this movie. I had to buy it as I have 2 young daughters that I will want to show it to. My class watched it the last day of school and loved it.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|If you like psych thriller this is it. You will love it ! Watch it carefully with no distractions or you'll get lost
B000MV90IU|5.0|This is one movie that I've been wanting to see and it was a real good movie. This movie is well worth the purchase.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|As always Tom Hanks gives us a tear churker . Theirs more then one love story . Prepare yourself with napkins by your side .
B00005LK94|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Such a beautiful story !  Have shared with friends.
B008J4L3E6|4.0|Didnt think it was up to Mary Higgins Clark normal writing. Felt that there were too many characters and they got lost in the storyline
B006PTNQGU|5.0|My son loves all of the Richie Rich movies.  He watched it during a car trip.  Would recommend this for sure.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful game but it just wasn't long enough! A very different puzzle game than the usual ones for tablets! The puzzle are hard but not too hard to figure out!
1452110581|5.0|This was a really cute book.  I bought it for my daughter, my sister and myself.  It describes our kitties perfectly!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game.  ot goes on forever and there is so much to do that you never get bored. love it!
0345529057|5.0|Fantastic series, I am completed addicted to the books. Great character development and the plot keeps changing. It is hard to put the books down as one always wants to know what is happening with your favourite characters.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really got tied into the characters.  I even read a story locally about a young man who is wheel chair bound.  I definitely had a keen awareness of the delimma of his situation.  I actually missed the characters after the book was finished.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Written well but with some cursing which I didn't appreciate.  Chris functioned in a difficult military arena.  He had to be tough to undergo the rigors of sniper duty.  He was the best.  It's too bad he's gone.
B002S45V32|1.0|This isn't a movie review, it's a movie service review...signed up for Prime thinking it may be better than Netflix but... two for two neither movie played through all the way....frustrating and a waste of time.  No more, I'll buy or rent through cable from now on.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Love this series and as a Book Club we have enjoyed it so much. Love the characters and their stories! Can't wait to continue hearing about their lives! Archer is amazing!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic show.  Best thing on television.<br />Great plots, acting, everything great television is supposed to be.<br />Why can't American TV give us anything but reality shows?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie, I am such a nerd, I have watched this movie already 5 times and could watch it again another 5 times...lol.<br />The movie itself runs without any problems and would definetly recommend this to my friends and family
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game makes your brain think and get into an interesting storyline great for late nights when you can't sleep!!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|I bought this as an afterthought, while ordering Hunger Games.  This one is worth keeping and watching again.  Country people in too deep with lots of what I like best - Reality.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|The turntable works well. The transfer of sound to my Apple iBook G4 is excellent. I down rated this unit for its less than optimal software. The feature &#34;Automatic Track Splitting&#34; does not work well for me. I'm transferring LP records of classical music. Any minute pause in the music, even if it is as short as a fraction of a second, is interpreted by the software as the end of the track. Useless!!<br />I have to disable the automatic feature, and stay by the unit while the record is playing, splitting the tracks manually. Quite a loss of time. It's possible that the automatic feature works better with popular music. I haven't tried it yet.
B00004RJ74|4.0|Salma Hyak and Juliette Lewis in the same movie!  And Harvey Keitel (ex USMC).  Too much blood and guts and nasty language.  So why have I seen it three times?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautiful, authentic sets and costumes, wonderful casting, superb acting and writing all combine to make some of the most enjoyable viewing of some time.  Does require a certain knowledge of history and politics, but the intelligence factor only adds to the enjoyment.  Recommend to all lovers of drama.
B0012Q732O|4.0|Life in the bad old days of caves and cannibals.  I usually skip movies full of special effects, but this one caught my attention.  You will like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game is a lot of fun when your bored or in the car or even on a horse good time consuming game
B00007L4OM|5.0|Too bad the English version was dubbed!!!  Have to watch it in French to get the full effect of the great Jean Reno.  He is James Bond and Dirty Harry all-in-one here.  All cops should be like him.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I'm usually a book reader, but was looking for something different.  I recently watched the 2 seasons of Game of Thrones and was looking for something similar. The Spartacus series filled that desire and more. We see life from the Master of the house point of view to the slaves that serve them and the Gladiators who fight for them. The story lines are well written and you will find a hero or two to cheer for and some you will love to hate.  The show is filmed with amazing camera work and put together well.  I like the modern music some of the fight scenes are put to, it gives the theme an updated feel.  All in all, the action, story and acting are all packed. This is series 0. Be sure to get 1 and 2. They are just as good. The only thing to caution you is some of the fight scenes are gruesome (intestines spilling out and the like) and you are going to see lots of naked women and men. If you are a fan of True Blood on HBO, you will see Godric (Eric's maker) in the 2nd season.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Silly.  Running through the a forest full of unseen scientific monitors hooked to a distant control room.  Worse than those Special Effects-dominated kids movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the game but it is challenging! Can be a little aggravating when you cant figure it out!!  But still a great game!!!
159448385X|3.0|Although different characters this book has the same setting as The Kite Runner a war ravaged country and the innocents who survive despite heartache, poverty, and cruelty the people go on. It has changed my perspective  another culture. Previously only seen repots from the news media. Held my attention read in two days.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|Love it! Tend to love this one more than his 2nd album even though I also love the 2nd. If I had to choose between, this would be my first choice.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I am a huge Castle fan and this book did not disappoint! I loved every word, turn and twist in the story!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game! I'm on it everyday. I don't give my kids a chance to play on it anymore lol. I make them go to the big computer.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|We were traveling and the alarm clock in hotel was non-functional. I downloaded this quickly and it was very easy to use. Really liked the increasing sound.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty entertaing. If you're bored there's plenty of games to keep you entertained for quite a while.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I love figuring out the hints and puzzles. Just wish there were more levels! Hint, Hint, HINT!
1781162646|5.0|When Stephen King's pen is finally laid to rest, perhaps the one enduring feature of his work will be his ability to connect with his readers on almost a personal level. In \\"Joyland\\", though not nearly the best King tale ever spun, the Master is again able to relate the subject matter (in this case carnivals) so close to your soul that you can't help but get invested.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, \\"Joyland\\" tells the story of a college student who gets a summer job in the carnival business. While working at Joyland one summer, the young man must not only deal with age-related issues such as \\"the loss of the first steady girl\\" and \\"what am I going to do with my life\\", but also fitting into the carny atmosphere and dealing with the ghost that supposedly haunts the premises of the park's spookiest ride.<br /><br />What makes \\"Joyland\\" such an interesting story is that most readers will be able to relate to the carnival atmosphere. As children, usually on at least one occasion, we have all been fascinated by attending a carnival or fair (big or small). I know I could relate. Thus, the rides, terminology, imagery, and themes in the book immediately strike a nostalgic chord.<br /><br />It also helps that this is a good story. Not King's very best, I would have to say, but intriguing enough and visceral enough to produce the kind of emotions that really will make you feel as if you care about the principles.<br /><br />Please, whatever you do, do not be scared away from this novel because of its marketing as \\"Hard Case Crime\\" noir. To me, this was just a typical King yarn and in no way, shape, or form any kind of \\"genre\\" tale.<br /><br />If you are a fan of King or just like human-relatable stories in general, \\"Joyland\\" will be a fun read for you. It isn't too \\"deep\\", but also isn't too \\"scarce\\" either. A nice summer read out by the lake.
B003UBTX72|3.0|Book shows hard work at your craft can payoff. Being at the right time and place may be equally as important. Pretty amazing story. Enjoyed the history and the discussion of the various musicians that had impact on his progression. His noting the lack of quality drugs had a lot of impact. We note the war on drugs has long been pursued with what appears the drugs out financing the effort to extinguish them. Book has its high and low points. Keith Richards has rocked me since I was 13. What a ride the Stones have been.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|One day I was watching a review on this.. the guy criticized the whole game so when I got it I was blown away it was amazing. It looked just like black ops. No joke my only minor complaint is that I can't find the best control scheme that suits me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great Read! Being in a combat zone, very close to heart. America has lost a brave Hero!!. May Chris Kyle rest in peace....
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|I just finished listening to my old \\"Deguello\\" and the new disc does sound like it's had some re-mastering work done to it....not as extensive as some of the other albums have ...but the low end is better and the separation is better.<br />I love the set..and the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the packaging...the sleeves are way too thin and could easily tear...but the music is excellent.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My son loved the sample so much we bought the full version.  My son is 8, but its good for younger kids too.
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|I've read all of  Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.  The books wer outstanding.  You get a mental image of Reacher and it's laughable to picture PRETTY BOY cruise in the role.  I watched the trailer and that was enough for me.  The Reacher role needs a big rough type.[[ASIN:B00COGZ8FU Jack Reacher]]
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The app downloaded but will not open fro my HTC One. I can see that it registered the phone to my Amazon account but I still does not work
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season opener has you on the edge of your seat the whole way! Just when you think you figured it out they change it. Great show!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was such an amazing story. The characters were brought to life and the book touched me in so many ways!
B002ONC9NC|3.0|nothing new and nothing that will make  you want to watch again and again and yet it had a  curiosity about it  because of the time period and everything that occurs and  goes down. it has  some parts of it where  it feels  a bit dry and then it has other aspects of it that keeps  wondering what may or may not happen and  how  it reflects a particular mind set that sees things in a different light. its a  cool film and  you  will  remember the performances more than the film on a whole.  its a cool film though.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|This app is a great idea but the way it actually works is not great. At all. I bought this app expecting to be able to write my books (writing one right now) while on the go. Well the app is SO SLOW and I can't find PowerPoint and you only have a minimal amount of page layouts. What sucks is it in English and then the other half is like Thai or whatever. My grandma only speaks Spanish so she can't even use it. Yay.<br />:p
B005K17RU0|2.0|This app was much better before the last update. Please bring back the old app it was easier to use and understand.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Ultra-annoying that this game downloads for free, takes forever to download, then wants you to pay after the first chapter is completed. All in all seems pretty decent but I hate pay-as-you-go games!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Like many others, I just couldn't see the little pipsqueak Cruise playing Jack Reacher, a smart guy and a big and badass bruiser. But since the reviews were favorable even with this miscasting I gave it a shot.<br /><br />The storyline is action packed, fast paced, and Lee Child's story is well played. The supporting actors do a great job and take some of the pressure off Cruise minimizing his physical difference from Child's Reacher. Duvall is especially good as the gun range owner turned operative. Cruise, in a credit to his acting ability, does a masterful job with every aspect of the Jack Reacher character readers imagine, and keeps us from dwelling upon the fact that he is not over 6 feet tall. A definite thumbs up.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I do not have words to describe this film.  I wish I could, but I can't.  One just has to watch it, be sucked into it, and be redeemed by a story that is more impossible than you can ever imagine.  Take a trip into music history and see with your own eyes why what we think we know and believe is far, far from the truth. That is a COLD FACT!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its a good game but not amazing as I said before. it doesn't have a wow factor or a game changer.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Season 5 arrived earlier than anticipated and in excellent conditon. I would totally reccommend Amazon to a friend, I've order multiple DVDs and boxsets over the years and I am always satisfied.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater in 3D and thought it was the best Superman movie out of all the others.  It starts at the beginning, with SuperBaby being born on the planet Krypton to the mother and father Jorell(Russell Crowe).  (Please forgive name mispellings) The core of Krypton is collapsing.  War has broken out as General Zod fights for control.  He kills one of the high muckity mucks and attempts to take Jorell.  Just in the nick of time, Mom and Dad catapult SuperBaby to Planet Earth, so that he may live, along with a metal object for his later use.  Back on Krypton, General Zod and his henchpersons are banished to the Phantom Zone but swears he will find the son of Jorell one day and take revenge.  (You know all this anyway from the former versions of Superman.)<br /><br />We fast-forward about 30 years where we meet a grown up Superguy Clark Kent (Henry Cavill, who also played in the Immortals).  Superguy is working on a ship.  We flip back and forth for awhile to Clark at different ages and learn about how he got to Earth, how he was found by his Earth Mom and Dad Kevin Costner.  We also look at how Clark grew up and the wisdom his dad taught him.  Now Clark is about age 30 and he moves around a lot, to keep from being identified for his unique skills.<br /><br />In Antartica, he meets reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams from the Disney musical Enchanted), and Lois realizes there is something real special about Super Dude.  As with any nosey reporter, and against the wishes of her editor (Lawrence Fishburn), she begins to snoop.  Meanwhile General Zod is out and about and looking for Cal-El (aka Superman) to get the Codex and bring it back to what's left of the people of Krypton.<br /><br />This is a high-action movie.  Once the action starts, it will blow you away.  The CGI is awesome and so much gets blown and blasted and smashed.  The CGI people did one fantastic job.  BTW - Christopher Meloni (Law and Order SVU) is also in the film and my son recognized lots of other folks that I didn't remember, other than they looked familiar.<br /><br />This was a great movie to see on the big screen and I think you will probably want to own it when it comes out too.  The 3D was great too.s of other folks that I didn't remember, other than they looked familiar.<br /><br />This was a great movie to see on the big screen and I think you will probably want to own it when it comes out too.

B005HSL626|5.0|Whenever I want to pass time and/or when I am bored, I play Fruit Ninja.  This game is very fun, and it makes me feel like I am an actual ninja, minus the actual swords.<br /><br />As for the fruit, the fruit in this game is making me to start eating more fruit because of it!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy reading book. Could relate to. I enjoyed this book  very much.  I will recommend book this to others people.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I didn't follow American Idol, but I am amazed he didn't win. Adam Lambert is a musical genius and I love this album.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|A classic that my family and I love! We can watch it over, and over, and over, the love never fades
B009U9S6FI|4.0|The first part of the book was great. The story and the analysis begin  it was eye opening. The second  part - talking about psychotherapy wasn't I interesting to me - so I skipped it.
159463176X|5.0|It's beautiful,  have not finished yet .... trying to prolong the enjoyment!<br />Read the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns as well,  loved both,  with Thousand Suns being my favorite.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A whole lot of fun.  It is a great way to relax while also excersizing your mind.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I'm sure you will, too.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Well-constructed story. Liked the world in which it was set. Will read the sequels. Would recommend - it's a fun read.
0425263924|5.0|I made the mistake of reading some reviews before starting this book, and expected to be disappointed after so many negative comments. Obviously, reading is subjective and we're all going to take something different from a book, but once I started reading, I realized this was a perfect installment to the Crossfire series, and I'm really pleased that Sylvia is continuing with the story. She's created a whole cast of truly powerful yet flawed characters, and in the first three books she's allowed us to see their growth, their setbacks, and the growing understanding of their conflicted relationships. I'm loving every page, and definitely looking forward to the next in the series.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Very bright and colorful. 4 mo daughter loves talking to them! They stuck very well and so far so good, no peeling. Makes her room look really pretty. Great product for a very good price. Totally well worth the money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This third book of the Hunger Games trilogy is an action packed home run. The characters are a  blend of desperation<br />and an epic quest worthy of Odysseus. The satisfying ending seems to wrest a tenuous peace from the poignant victors that even they are not sure they deserve.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? The Beach boys and the California sounds between back the best of the 60's. Dsiguised in the naivite of their music the the creative genus of composing and blending of voices and &#34;the sound&#34; that made them great!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|Before I start, I should say I have mixed feelings about live albums in general. I've heard so many varieties, but usually for me they never match the originals. And I guess they never can because the live version always has a different energy from the original. And because of the technology available only in the studio and not live, the original can often times sound better than the live, even if the energy isn't there.<br /><br />This live set is fantastic, is one of the few live albums that doesn't even pretend to compete with the orignals. It's totally different, and complements the originals in its own unique way.<br /><br />The core RTF (Chick Corea-Stanley Clarke-Lenny White) power-trio plus Frank Gambale on guitar and Jean-Luc Ponty on violin.  You get nearly two hours of music on CD plus nearly two hours of video. The music covers many of the great tracks from all four of RTF Mark II years, plus a few addiitions, such as Clarke's School Days, Ponty's Renaissance, and RTF Mark I (the early pre-power Latin phase) track Spain.<br /><br />I was a JLP fan before I discovered RTF last year. Ironically, I discovered him the year he did the tour with RTF that spawned this album, and I have kicked myself many times since then for not seeing them play live.....JLP is absolutely superb. If you enjoy his stuff you'll enjoy him and the others here too.<br /><br />Frank Gambale is terrific here. He turned out to be a great choice to fill in Al Di Meola's and Billy Connor's shoes (Di Meola reunited with them in 2008 but left after that tour and Connors was to join for this but had to decline due to ill health).  He really blends Di Meola and Connors with his own style.<br /><br />And I cannot say enough about Chick, Stanley and Lenny either - they are all superb and in top form as well. If you've ever wondered what any of these five would sound like solo, you'll get plenty of opportuity on this live set. Most if not all the tracks have lots of solos and all are superb.<br/><br />The video is superb as well -warning though, If you are expecting  2 hours of concert, you won't get it. Instead you will get a 1-hour documentary on the band and how they came up with the songs for the tour, videos of two performances from the tour, plus additional mini-trailer with shots of the band on the road. Not sure what this is a trailer for, if it is a trailer for the Mothership set, the tour, or an upcoming documentary. Anyway, you'll enjoy that too. If you really want 2-hours of video of performance, get the 2008 Live at Montreux video of RTF with Al Di Meola. That video also complements the Mothership set as well (most of the set lists except one or two songs are different).<br /><br />Anyway I highly recommend this for all RTF and Ponty fans, even if you are a studio album purist like me.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Hearne keeps you reading with incredible wit and tons of modern as well as older literature references.  Highly suggested for anybody thats a fan of the Dresden files.
B004EF65QA|5.0|A movie in the same company of Pride and Prejudice, Jane Erye and other British classics,<br />I could watch these episodes over and over again. If you love a good story of romance, drama and period movies I highly recommend these episodes. This is worth the money or if you have a Prime Membership (free streaming) its worth the time watching it. Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it, I can't wait for more levels! This game really makes you use your deducing skills...awesome game for zero money
B007W8S2MG|4.0|This is one of the best games available for the Vita if you are a fan of the Genre. Expect to spend well over 40 hours on this game.
B00709GTGS|5.0|ACTUALY IT IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT MOVIE WITH<br />NEAR PERFECT CASTING. &#34;THE DOG THAT SAW A RAINBOW&#34;<br />IS SOMETHING TO MUSE OVER.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Bought this on Amazon after seeing Jersey Boys in NYC. I grew up with the Four Seasons music so it is great to have this to listen to now. Seller recommended thanks for offering it.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|This was a great game till today. It won't even load up now. I hit the app and instantly it says world at arms has stopped. If game loft thinks I am going to delete and download again and lose all that I spent , there WRONG! Screw them! If they don't fix my my game I will just report them for fraud and theft. I work for Amazon, so once I report this app they will be done. But before I file a report I will give time to explain and fix the problems like Amazon would they 5 days after I post this review. Here That GameLoft 5 day's. Right now I give them NO stars, if they fix this problem and it playable again they will get 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best knock-off of temple run ever... I actually like this game better! I just love tho game so much this is where my days go
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If there is a way to play this game forever  would  because it it awesomely fun to play and is the best on a trip
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a really nice diversion. The developer did an great job designing the rooms and made them feel multi-dimensional. The puzzles are challenging but not too difficult. I hope new levels are available soon. I thoroughly enjoyed playing the first 10 rooms.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very engaging, well crafted and well developed.  The characters are presented in depth,the world unfolds through the story and is of complexity and depth enough to make you think more deeply about our own.
0525952926|5.0|This book surely brought history into focus for me. It totally changed my perspective of the world I have lived in for 67 years. Along with the first book, it gave me a clear understanding of Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, WWI, WWII, Pearl Harbor, Woman's Sufferage, Nazism, the Atomic Bomb, and of course human nature. So far he has tied it all together in a neat little package. Absolutely loved it!!! My only regret is that he had to skip over a few events, but this is understandable. All-in-all, the account is amazingly thorough.Even the economy, throughout history, is well explained. Eagerly looking forward to the third book.
B00CBT04LI|4.0|This movie of course cant TOP the 1982 version, as cast and effects for that time ,was just Genesis flick & still is to this day ,own it & watched it many times since 80S!<br />BUT this new version is pretty good , I like the updated special effects, cast is Eh.. Story is pretty good & interesting to fallow also Thrilling & Suspenseful, after all NOT BAD!<br />IF U Ever see it under 10 box,Defiantly worth to buy it on blu-ray, like i did!<br />Nice Thriller and real good in PQ & AQ on Blu-ray & is 2.40:1 Widescreen,That's way i like it!<br />Is solid B rated flick!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I stayed up until I finished all possible levels!  It was a surprise to love it so much.  The only problem was how tired I was the next day.  I'd do it again though when they devise more levels!
B003JSU2NU|5.0|The CD was in the original packaging and plays just fine.  In the true alternative vein like the other movies, the music is wonderful.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is very unique - since it is told from the guys point of view. It cracked me up and I was astonished how well this female author nailed the guy POV.  Quit reading all the reviews and hit buy- you will not regret it.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Nice, quiet, beautiful white noise that sounds so natural and beautiful that the sandman cant beat! Nice background for when reading or entertaing at meal time. Very nice app thank you
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I felt like I was trapped in the ground hog day movie - it was the same thing or conversation over and over. Did the author just copy and paste in order to make novel?  I am done with the series! Just make up our own ending in your head and save your money. Totally disappointed and feel cheated in order for this author to drag this series out in order to make more money. Sometimes you just got to say &#34;the end&#34; as a author and move on to new characters and a new storyline. Your fans will follow if you are a good writer (which you Ms Day are) but if you write in circles to make more money - it is hard for fans to trust your work in the future.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Awesome story!  Actors are top notch -- A show I can watch with my 11 and 15 year old sons and enjoy as well!
B000I8G5B2|5.0|Gattaca, in a word, is a brilliant science fiction film.<br />No matter where you look, Gattaca astounds you, and holds up against the years. It is destined to become a science fiction classic.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke gives a flawless performance as Vincent Freeman, one of the last natural humans in a world of genetic enhancement, pre-birth specialization, and advanced science. Jude Law, in perhaps his finest performance ever, beautifully portrays a tortured and broken wreck of a man. Uma Thurman plays a femme fatale, and Alan Arkin, the scene-stealing noirish detective (Gattaca pays a lot of homages to film noir classics of old). The rest of the cast gives brilliant performances, and the result is a character driven sci-fi (Solaris, Blade Runner), rather than a tech-driven sci-fi (Aliens, Star Trek Into Darkness).<br /><br />The characters hold up just as well. Each is real, sympathetic, layered, and deep.<br /><br />Andrew Niccol, writer of The Truman Show, directs with subtle nuance, attention to detail, and an eye for a good image. The cinematography of Gattaca is astounding, atmospheric, and very beautiful, with throwbacks to sci-fi films of old such as Blade Runner, and the great cinematic film noirs. The sets and technology fit the film perfectly - never showy (as sci-fi films often tend to be) but perfectly fitting the world of the film.<br /><br />The action and suspense pack Gattaca to the top. The suspense is kept on full burn the entire film, with Vincent being suspected of the brutal murder of a flight planner. A riveting cat-and-mouse game begins between the characters, with myriad twists, turns, and agonizingly tense bursts of action.<br />But at it's core, Gattaca is a film with a heart. It has an emotional core to it, a sensitive, at times romantic and sad core. It's ending is both thrilling, intensely touching, and brilliant. It also asks important questions about ethics, the nature of science, mankind, and genetics. It's view of the future is believable, entertaining, and ingenious.<br /><br />Gattaca is one of cinema's most underrated science fiction films. A character driven masterpiece, with brilliant acting and direction, cool tech, a brilliant story, and a thought-provoking core, Gattaca is destined to reign with cinema's all-time great sci-fi films.<br /><br />5 Stars! Strongest Recommendation!vable, entertaining, and ingenious.<br /><br />Gattaca is one of cinema's most underrated science fiction films.

B00CATSONE|4.0|When I was in school, history was boring and never delved into the behind the scenes events that shaped people's lives.  This book showed what inventors were up against at a certain time in history.  Not only did you need an invention, but you needed to protect it from your lying, thieving fellow man. If my history textbooks would have humanized their stories the way this book did, history class would have been a lot more fun.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Jack Reacher is an above-average crime thriller. It evokes past genre classics such as Bullitt, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, and Heat. And while not surpassing those films, Jack Reacher still manages to entertain with Cruise's cool, charismatic performance.<br /><br />Don't worry about his height. Cruise evokes Reacher's no-nonsense attitude and brutal ass-kicking to a \\"T\\". As the covers say (and this is coming from a fan of the books), Tom Cruise IS Jack Reacher. He does fine work in the role, carrying the film and capturing the attention. The guy, love him or hate him, CAN act. Just watch Magnolia for that. And recently, he's been putting out some pretty fine performances: his Stacee Jaxx, a muscular, tattooed, death-metal star was the best thing about Rock of Ages, and his performance as Jack Harper in Oblivion was also excellent.<br /><br />The rest of the fine cast holds up well. The action is realistic, fast, brutal, and heavy, but also cool and slick. McQuarrie proves to be a good choice of director.<br /><br />Jack Reacher may not be the greatest crime/action film ever made, but it's certainly entertaining and a cut above the rest when it comes to acting, action, plot, and visual style. Have fun.<br /><br />4 Stars! Recommended!
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|Played on Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy S II.<br /><br />If you're a fan of time management games, you'll like having the portability of this standard. It's fairly easy play on the Kindle and more difficult on the Android only because it's difficult to identify the food items. It's hours of play and occasionally has some item change-up.<br /><br />In about 3 restaurants, when delivering hot food to a bookworm, it only gives you 10 points rather than the cumulative delivery score plus the 75 for perfect cooking. This makes it difficult to attain the expert level, but do-able.<br /><br />I don't like that the optional dessert cake is so close to the end stool that you often end up just cashing them out thereby missing the opportunity to gain points from serving dessert.<br /><br />The last game-play item I didn't like was that when you want to replay a certain level, the game throws you all the way back to the main menu rather than just back one level to the restaurant selection menu.<br /><br />Playfirst does their usual strong-arm after the 3rd restaurant to get you to pay for 5 additional restaurants plus they \\"give\\" you a Chinese restaurant on a \\"free\\" app and then inundate you with ads to buy their other games. Once I've paid for something, I don't want to see ads.
B002AT4K9G|2.0|The dvd came a little later then supposed to, also I was really looking forward for this movie but it turn out to be really disappointed. The box was even broken the dvd could of just fallen how sad. The dvd doesn't look that good it has scratches hopefully it works.
B000002NJS|5.0|What makes Ray of Light so good?<br /><br />This album has truly stood the test of time, the music, the lyrics, the vocals and the production ARE the dance, choreographed in graceful synchronicity with one another.  This album pushes musical boundaries in directions they were never meant to go, the lyrics are mainly positive, and show a maturity that had not been in her music previously, exploring religion, parenthood, and spiritual fulfillment.<br /><br />Each song is a dance, and there isn't a weak dance on this disc, and each dance is it's own style and variation, from the reggae styling of \\"The Power of Good-bye\\", to the driving club beat of \\"Skin\\", to the cinematic grandeur of \\"Frozen\\".  The sheer number of musical landscapes this album covers is astounding.  Each dance on this album has a life of it's own, and is not as easily digested as most of her previous work.  This is the thinking and feeling version of Madonna.<br /><br />William Orbit provides the perfect sonic landscapes for Madonna to tell her stories in, with music that is joined with her voice instead of simply providing a simple and predetermined back beat.  The marriage of voice and music on this record is nearly perfect, and rarely have I ever heard an album with as much emotional intensity as this album has.  This is what music was meant to be.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that everybody listen to this entire album at least once, as there is something for everyone here, regardless of what your preference in genre is.  This album is really a worth a chance.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I just bought this game and having a hard time putting it down!! For a free game it is still fun to play, even though there is the option to buy stuff it's not required :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My grandma and I thought this game was good for your brain to have a workout. We also can't wait for more levels! Thank you for this awesome game!
B005USZYDU|4.0|Very good but weird place to end... I liked the book though it had a lot of good info and never really got boring.
B008476HBM|5.0|Surprisingly I enjoyed this, not sure why as it's not my usual cup of tea, but I felt quite chuffed with the experience.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It give a good amount of skill and keeps you guessing. Very clever which makes it fun and different every level.
0671015206|1.0|This book is one of the most boring books I've ever read on personal finance. The concept is simple, live below your means, save and invest your money. The authors try to bring in other interesting facts such as \\"are English descents wealthier?\\". However I find even that effort to be pointless. I'm very disappointed with this book. Don't buy this book. If you must read it, then go to the library!
B0063IH60K|2.0|This game was fun while it lasted, but within a month of doload,it froze and shut down. Too bad, I was really enjoying it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game very fun and addictive I just wish u didn't have to have Facebook to get friends. Updated are always something to look forward too. Money very well spent!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I think function is beautiful - this product is beautiful.  It's lightweight, well made, sleek, and protective.  It makes viewing movies easy and packing my kindle fire a breeze...
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best games I've ever played played with my friend and we made a huuuuuuuuuuuuge gold fortress
B0084IG7KC|4.0|My wife was very pleased to get the movie so quickly.  I was pleased by the price.  Quite a few changes between the book and the movie but no harm.
B004G600A4|3.0|It arrived 2 days early which was a plus, but the disk was scratched so I am unable to watch the last part of the movie without having to skip certain scenes.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Not sure why I waited so long to try Feedly, but with Google abandoning its RSS reader, I had to find another one. It is excellent and I am now using it on all my android devices.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I give this instalment a 5 because it's one of the best so far I look forward to the next
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A truly uplifting and inspiring documentary.  Doesn't seem that it could have happened to a more genuine, deserving, gracious, contented and down-to-earth person.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I recently read this book on the recommendation of my granddaughter. I found it very interesting in the way in which it was written. A must read ,giving an insight into how cancer patients react with each other. The book although quite sad, is not at all morbid.<br />For any one touched by childhood cancer, this book gives the ups & downs in a very realistic way.<br />Certainly worthwhile reading.
B008MM9630|4.0|Cute little game, begins with detailed tutorial but then drops off.  As with all &quot;free&quot; games, it is laden with in-app purchasing.  Still, it is nice when I need to waste some time at doctor's appointment...
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I have not finished this book yet, but am enjoying the read so far. There are quite a lot of characters in this book & one needs to separate them to see where the plot is heading.<br />Have also bought WINTER OF THE WORLD which is a sequel, so am anxious to see where it goes from FALL OF THE GIANTS
B0040HO01Y|4.0|but better as episodes go.  Enjoy the characters.  Not as good as Downton Abbey but second to that. Would watch again
1565112601|1.0|I thought I was getting a CD but received cassette tapes. I'm not sure why anyone would want cassette tapes. Very disappointed.
B002SR3T10|5.0|Buy this and play this any time of year . Christmas is a great time to listen to it to get away from the regular Joy To The Worlds
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this is a very addicting game it is so fun and it is FREE!! I would suggest downloading it  very fun.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|yes, i ruined it for you but deep down you knew it all along . buy it and play it when it gets to your house
0062238868|3.0|There's an urban legend about a reporter asking a sniper \\"what do you feel when you shoot an Al Quaeda fighter\\" to which he replies \\"erm.......recoil\\".  In reading this book you'll not get a much more in-depth feeling on what goes on inside a snipers head.<br /><br />It's an interesting book.  It does tell the story of Chris growing up and choosing the military.  It describes his training to become a Seal.  It describes his tours of duty and what he saw.  In many ways it does tell a story, but there's so many events crammed in - it jumps about a lot within each chapter - that there's little real depth or real description.  I'd characterize it as \\"we got shot at\\" rather than an account of the sights, sounds and feelings/emotions of the battle.  Bearing in mind the subject that's probably fine for most, but I'd have preferred a bit more.<br /><br />I also agree with others that the passages from Chris' wife Taya - whilst well meaning - didn't add too much.  They were at least kept short enough that I didn't mind them too much.<br /><br />Despite the above, I did still enjoy the book.  I feel a certain affinity for Chris.  He was able to describe some of his traits and characteristics, some of which I could relate to (despite being personally a million miles away from being a Navy Seal!).  He was an honorable man and his death is the ultimate in tragic irony.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I love it this is my new favorite show, and Tatiana Maslany is an amazing actress she makes this show what it is
B008JFUUIA|1.0|This is truly one of the worst movies of any year. It is totally tasteless and revolting. There is not one funny or amusing moment in this entire film. Like all stupid movies of today, this should be avoided at all costs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|As you go through it gets more challenging. The concept reminds me a bit of the Mist puzzles where you need things from somewhere else for the solution. Very addicting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The first season hooked me, but season 2 was captivating.  The story gave a perspecitve on the impact of WWI on those ar home.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|I Love this holster! It's easy, saves my neck & back and frees my hands to make adjustments when needed.
0241951453|5.0|This is a timeless book and an even better motion picture.  It's hard to believe that the same author wrote this and &#34;In COld Blood&#34;.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Tis is a great app to help keep track of your available battery charge.  I love this app!  Highly recommend.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This was the first Slender man game that I've actually played. There is a huge difference between watching someone play and playing  it yourself, I near shat my pants! But I did manage to collect the 8 pages on try number 2 (only because it was on easy:/) I definitely recommend this game, it seems like it should be worth way more than a dollar. The only advice I'll give to anyone who plans on purchasing is stay near the trees. I'm sure you can figure out why.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Fun movie.  Best movie out of the three Transformers trilogy.  I have ben a transformers fan since i was a child.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love it so far. very interactive... much to keep you busy and entertained ... and its free. Perfect for any equestrian and horse lover.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times over the years and decided to introduce my 13 year old grandson to it. Still an awesome movie, and one he really enjoyed. Bueller? Bueller? Oh, yeah! :)
B008P9M614|5.0|It was delievered fast and was in the condition they said it would be(new). I miised some of the shows and now I can grt caught up. Would recomend it to House fans.
B00A6RCSKC|3.0|This is a really fun game I played it online but when I got it on my kindle a box would pop up and say I dont own the app even tho I had paid for it and it makes me get out of the app please fix this I want to play what I bought
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones is great. One of the best shows I have gotten into watching. Look forward to getting seasons i don,t have yet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Love being kept busy using my brain. Not too difficult, doesn't make you want to gi e up or stop playing completely.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app works great, and I can't understand all the negative reviews. To use it to its fullest potential, also get ES File Explorer. After you search for a video, tap and hold to bring up a list of choices. If you download, you will find your file in the ES video files folder, not downloads. Both downloading and watching videos worked flawlessly. I highly recommend this app!
B00CW665VI|5.0|It's true what everyone is saying, this book will make you laugh out loud, cry for all womenkind, and actually root for the manwhore that is Drew. Emma Chase is brilliant in telling this story through a man's POV. I can't wait for more from this author!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Tightly written. All facts are important. Strong characters. Logical plot development, but has some unanticipated twists, so keeps your interest.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Love it. I can read it again and again. Great book from a great author. One of my favorite book's.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I love Ender's Game. A lot. But after rereading both Ender and Speaker within the last few months I have to say that Speaker trumps. The characters are what make this book: you have a whole spread of messed up people that have to deal with issues larger than themselves, as well as the extremely creative interactions between different alien races, all tied together by Card's unparalleled insight into the human mind.<br /><br />If you have only read Ender's Game, do yourself a favor and pick this up next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So hooked on this series and can't wait for the new series to begin.  It draws you in and seems so real to life back then.
0061992860|4.0|This is an excellent book for a backpack reference on how to  get by when life goes bad. It's a book derived by the British special air service. ( special forces ). Remember your imagination is your best tool.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg is a thought provoking exploration of women's ongoing struggle for equality. Sandberg doesn't shy away from the things people think but often don't say out loud or if they do only whisper in guarded situations with trusted friends. Lean In addresses the idea of leadership and women taking a more active role in leading. Sandberg addresses the dynamics between men and women in the workplace and at home. She discusses how we all limit ourselves and one another. Lean In made me want to lean in to my own life and my own goals. Her words made me think about how I live my life and whether or not I'm setting an example that encourages those around me to lean in, to sit at the table\\", and to embrace their power. And, conversely, to think about every time I've leaned back, denied my right to a place at the table, or suppressed my power. Men and women alike will benefit from reading Lean In because Sandberg discusses ways in which both men and women can improve the work environment and the home environment. She brings examples from her personal life into the story with ease to clarify her points and to humanize the experience. Even with the personal stories Sandberg includes, Lean In doesn't read like a memoir due to the numerous studies and the research she references. Lean In is the beginning, or perhaps the renewal, of a conversation that needs to take place in boardrooms, in classrooms, in homes, and in every day life.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really like this book because I love Rick riordan books and adventure.i recommend this to people who like adventure
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this video. I do it almost everyday and have noticed huge results. I recommend it to everyone. I love it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I have seen many versions of this tale, but it always surprises me how each telling can bring something new to the table.  This version was much more upbeat then some and lighter on the snark, yet still kept the wit and flow of the novel.  Very well done!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a big fan of Vince Flynn, his books keep me locked in to a zone.  I can't wait for his next novel, he just cant write them fast enough. Thanks Vince; waiting for your next block buster!!!<br /><br />Ralph McInvale
0307949486|5.0|One of the best suspense novels I've read in a long time.<br />Bit gruesome at times,but a very good read
B004J64QSI|5.0|Everyone has already said it... but it bears repeating. This concert was a very enjoyable event for fans of Les Miserables. Incredible!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Thank you! Great film and quick delivery. Have to get the 2-disc set now. So much more I wanted to see from this production.
030758660X|5.0|I bought this book out of curiosity, I am not a Twilight fan at all, I prefer Bram Stoker's type of vampires, but I love the idea of gothic knitting.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this book and the different type of projects. True, there are only 2 sweater patterns (none of which are for a grown woman), but there are some beautiful scarves, mittens, socks, and a to-die-for lace shrug. There are quite a few lace projects, and a lot of red and black, which gives the overall style a sense of gothic Victorian. The photographs are absolutely mouthwatering, and the writing is cute and fun (even for non-Twilight fans), and I want to make most of the projects in this book. (But as another reviewer said, always check for errata before starting ANY project in ANY knitting book.)<br /><br />Highly recommended as an interesting book to add to your pattern collection, IF vampire inspired / gothic knitting is your style.
0439023513|5.0|Couldn't believe what great condition the book came in for such a goo price. Could not have found anything like that in a used book store
B00CATSONE|4.0|Love the history of technology.  The confluence of factors needed to make a great idea take hold are always interesting to look at in retrospect.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie because I am an absolute Alfred Hitchcock fan and thought if anyone could capture him, Anthony Hopkins would.  I found his performance uneven and a few times his voice sounded more like Hannibal Lector than Hitchcock.  Having seen most of Hopkins' films, this is the first time in decades I wasn't wowed by his performance.  Helen Mirren steals the show as Alma Hitchcock, the woman behind the man who never got the credit she rightfully deserved.  Mirren is strong and subtle, while Hopkins overacts and turns Hitch into somewhat of a caricature. The movie tells you very little about Hitchcock the man, and more about the evolution of his film Psycho.  It's entertaining to be sure and alludes to the rumors about his love for his leading ladies, which has been in the press for years.  Hitch was one of the most famous directors of all time, and so it was surprising that he was held hostage by the studio to make changes to Psycho.  I always assumed he had carte blanche and total creative freedom.  I enjoyed it, but feel it could have been so much more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have been enamored with this series, but I think Season 2 is my favorite.  The acting, wardrobes and cinematography make it worth your while. I love Maggie Smith and she, as always, doesn't disappoint in Downton Abbey!  Although it has its soap opera moments, the story is romantic and entertaining.  I became engrossed with the characters and was so glad that I could watch the entire season  at the pace I wanted to.  I have waited a long time for something this good.
B004QCJA7W|5.0|The book is in great condition and makes a wonderful addition to our collection. I am glad that we were able to find it!
B00007EDY5|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when purchasing this product for my Nikon D3000. But it fits perfectly, locks snugly into place, and gets the job done. I definitely recommend it to other users. :)
B002UELJUY|5.0|The book was in great condition and makes a great addition to our collection. I am glad that we found it!
030758836X|3.0|I'll give it three stars because the first 98% of this book was exceptional.  But that's the best I can do, because the ending was a major let down.
B0074V3712|5.0|A complex subject matter told very very well.. I read it and then listened to it twice. The 1st couple of chapters and the last chapter should be required reading or listening for any educated person. The depth of the discussions and explanations are very deep and can get a lot of folks lost.. but if you really drill in to this book it will change your thinking about so many things about us as humans and also how we going forward and have been.  A masterworks by a great biologist and scientist.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I found this episode intriguing.  It is a little different take on a lawyer show.  I am four seasons behind.  Will probably watch only a few more old episodes to get a feel of who all the characters are and how they relate to each other.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I like the game and will change my rating when they change the feeding amounts back to what they were, or at least lower than what they are now! The amount of food needed to level up the dragons changed drastically and now is way too much.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Love this series. Cant say too much without spoiling it. It had some slow parts but the ending was amazing! Cant wait for next season.
B0013V33DG|5.0|Another of my favorite operas.  I've seen it several times and have seen it with Sills and Sutherland.  Dessay and Flores define the roles.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Enjoyed this game and didn't want the fun to ever stop but it was very entertaining. Finished levels 1-10 in minutes if you jst want to pass the time this is for you
B003G4W49C|5.0|I wish more teen-lit was as great as Ender's Game.  All the negative feelings I have for the author aside I found this to be a very great read with a striking ending and intense theme.
B00CMKPNBC|5.0|I first heard of it on a foreign TV program. I looked up online and love it. i listened to it almost every day. it makes my commute much enjoyable!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I've loved the film Blade Runner for years and finally decided to read the inspirational novel for the film.  Great science fiction novel to read. Offers an interesting view of the future.  Another amazing book from Philip K. Dick.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|omg this is probably my second fav. game ever.  its exciting to c where it will take you and how many clues there are. not like 100 floors!!!!! I seriously started at the afternoon and finished the same day no joke new levels coming soon :)
B0053O89KG|5.0|The show is just great!!!  I have to admit that I'm officially addicted to what consider the perfect police drama.  The<br />lighthearted way the whole cast interacts pushes the sometimes mundane cases to new levels of interest.  I don't<br />believe I've ever seen a more fitting cast/show combination.
1932735410|5.0|As a fresh PMP-holder I'd like to share my experience with this wonderful book.<br />I started learning about half of year ago with the 4th PMBOK Guide but didn't have that much time for learning so I just read the PMBOK occasionaly once or twice a week for a couple of hours. Some days more, some days less. Anyways, I found it quite informative but I couldn't get all of the material easily. Lots of concepts were familiar to me but there were things I found hard to understand, especially because I used to do them differently while managing projects.<br />After around 3 months I finished reading the PMBOK Guide and got myself Rita's book - it was a right decision. I found answers to all of my questions I had while reading the PMBOK. Rita's book is absolutely brilliant and I would highly recommend it as a preparation material. Of course now, with the 5th edition of the PMBOK out, you should wait until RMC's publishes the new version but serioulsy, no way you should miss it as a preparation material! It is very important that you do all the exercises in the book and take all the tests at the end of each chapter.<br />I read intensively Rita's book - daily after work for around 3 hours and 6 to 8 hours on weekends and finished it in 3-4 weeks.<br />Since I only had 1,5 month til my exam from that point I read it again the second time, mostly concentrating on my gaps. When I got finished, I read the PMBOK Guide again - after reading Rita's book it was so much easier to comprehend it!<br />From time to time I checked some chapters in the HeadFirst (and test questions) and the 5th PMBOK.<br />So here's the whole reading preparation process:<br />1. PMBOK Guide - reading carefully<br />2. Rita's book - reading very carefully (and understanding! :-)<br />3. Rita's book again - concentrating on gaps<br />4. PMBOK - concentrating on gaps<br />5. Check Head First / PMBOK the 5th edition from time to time<br />6. Went through PMBOK and Rita's book a couple of days before the exam.<br />I passed the test with a very good result and I wish you all too! This is a fantastic feeling - seeing \\"Congratulations!..\\" on your screen after submitting your test.<br />Good luck everyone!!!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I can't believe it!  Even the reruns are more interesting than much of the competition.  I seem to detect an increasing intensity<br />& cast cohesiveness - even with the side lines that are thrown in for tension.  I know that is the way a great product is created<br />& marketed, by it rarely occurs.  The reruns are great because I seem to catch something new with each viewing.  Sometimes<br />facial expressions are lost in the shadows & you can't see everyone's expressions at once.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I don't normally like apps that much but this one is so much fun and so flipping addicting! I would HIGHLY suggest getting this app!
B003L77FYS|5.0|The show continues to intrigue me.  The relationship between Stana & Nathan keeps the show headed upward.<br />In fact, as lightly as the show seems to sometimes take itself, all the character interactions push it even deeper<br />into an area rarely  realized by a show - enthralling.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm sure there are lots and lots of 5-star reviews of Firefly on here. No new info here, this is just awesome, if you haven't seen it, watch the whole thing, in order, and then watch the Serenity movie. Some of the best science fiction ever put to film.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|How could anyone who likes cop shows not like this?  The actors are great, the stories imaginative & there's enough suspense<br />(physical & emotional) to keep interests alive.
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I guess I must be to old for the humor in this movie.  I found the humorous part to few and far between and really not that funny if that's what you're looking for.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I bought the game a while ago and I stoped playing multiplayer but I played it today It's the best game ever
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book will engulf you from the beginning. It's got an element of love mixed with sadness and fear. There is an element of surprise at the end. It's not what you'll ever expect. One of the best books I've ever read.
B001RUXW48|5.0|I love the premise of this movie excellent!!! I would watch it again and again!! It is one of my favorite spy movies
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book book because it is different and very very very happy and very realistic and it has a good ending
B005LAIIMG|5.0|The summer of 2013 has not been a good one for movies. Again and again I've been treated to mediocre blockbusters from the dreadful Iron Man 3, to the disappointing Star Trek: Into Darkness, and \\"meh\\" Man of Steel. When the best movie I've seen all summer was the underrated sci fi Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion (which wasn't all that great either) you know it's a bad summer for movies. Nothing even came close to wowing me.<br /><br />World War Z on the other hand delivered exactly what I've always wanted from a zombie movie. Typically there are two types of zombie films. There's the Romero formula where a handful of survivors barricade themselves in a bunker of some kind (be it a house, a mall, an underground facility, etc) and attempt to wait out the storm, or the 28 Day Later/The Walking Dead story set a month or so after the war is already lost as the hero's fight to survive in the post-apocalyptic world. People like to complain that zombie movies have been played out but if you really think about it when it comes to bigger budgeted zombie movies almost every single one has followed one of these two formulas. As much as I love zombie movies, I've ALWAYS wanted to see a big, epic, war of the zombies. That NEVER happens.  I cannot think of one example of a decently budgeted zombie movie where we get to see the infection spread in real time and the world's government's attempts to fight it.<br /><br />As a fellow fan of the books, both World War Z and the equally fun Zombie Survival Guide, I understand the skepticism of many fans towards this movie.  No, it's not a faithful adaption. Yes, the only similarities are the title, the character names, and a few situations.  I get it. We fans are the hardest people in the world to please, and there's nothing we like less than an unfaithful adaption of a book we love. If that's going to be your hang up, I understand, and this is not the movie for you. However, if you are willing to overlook this fact, and watch this as its own standalone movie, then what awaits you is easily the best movie of the summer and one of the best zombie movies of all time. Besides Romero's original trilogy, no other zombie film I've seen can touch World War Z. It is the most epic, most intense, most nerve racking and scariest zombie film I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. No, it's not nearly as smart as the original Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead, and isn't quite as scary as Night of the Living Dead, but the shear scope of this film overshadows, at times,  even Romero's best efforts. I was legitimately scared by this film. That hasn't happened since I saw Night of the Living Dead for the first time. Zombies DON'T scare me. They just don't. But World War Z managed to do just that.<br /><br />The movie waste no time putting us right in the middle of the action. Apart from the opening or the PS3 game The Last of Us I don't think I've ever been as impressed with an opening to a movie like this. Twenty minutes into it Philadelphia is a blasted ruin, New Jersey is in chaos, the President is dead, and the military forced to fight the plague from the safety of their Atlantic fleet. From there on we get to witness Brad Pitt as he zips around the world from Pennsylvania, to South Korea, to Israel in an attempt to find the origins, and hopefully a cure, for the plague. Everywhere he goes the pace of the film is kept fast, tense, and in your face. Sure its gets kind of predictable as time goes by; Pitt goes to location A, zombies attack, he escapes, goes to location B, zombies attack, he escapes, etc, etc, etc. This would have really been better as a miniseries as it feels sort of episodic in nature and tries to cram a lot of locations and scenarios into its two hour run time, but frankly I felt they did this really well. Though the locations may change the tone and pacing are very consistent for the first three fourths of the movie, and Pitt being the great actor he is holds the film together even as his adventure spans the globe. It never felt choppy or disjointed, or like this was supposed to be a much longer story that was crammed into one shorter film. It all flowed surprisingly well and the fast pace kept my attention better than any action blockbuster this year. The formula is broken at the end when the film changes from non-stop action to slow, scary, suspense, but again though, I thought they did this remarkably well.<br /><br />I want to also give major kudos to those who made the decision to make the zombies the way they are. Besides Return of the Living Dead, this film has the most unstoppable zombies of any zombie film ever. Sometimes a bite takes ten seconds to turn someone, sometimes it takes a day. This allows for the outbreak to be extremely fast as we see in the opening but also allows for infected individuals to go undetected for long periods of time, only to turn when inside a safe zone. This, combined with the fact that only head shots bring them down and that they are able to climb over walls like a swarm of ants (not to mention they have magical jumping skills) makes these easily the scariest zombies ever put to film. Let's face it, making zombies a realistic threat to humanities survival isn't easy, but this movie makes the scenario frighteningly real. The speed with which the infection spreads and the ferocity of the zombies themselves makes for some very intense sequences.<br /><br />As for negatives, this movie does push the boundary on what we as an audience can be expected to believe. I can accept that zombies are impervious to pain, don't ever get tired, can climb on top of each other, etc. What I don't buy is when they fall off a huge freaking wall and don't break every bone in their bodies. It also gets really ridiculous the things Brad Pitt survives. He survives more potently fatal situations then Superman, and comes away with barely a scratch.  It's a little silly that way, but what action movie isn't?<br /><br />So if you are a fan of zombie movies, or just want a really fun action adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours, I can't recommend World War Z enough. If you've been dying to see an epic globe spanning zombie film like I have, there is no way you can miss this.e spans the globe.

B0025X4OYI|2.0|Is there anyone still gullible enough to give credence to 5 star ratings on Amazon? Apparently yes. Me.<br /><br />Because Ray Charles is one of my all time favorites and this recording has survived from 1962 I uncritically glanced at the reviews - all gushingly glorious - and ordered away. No one would need to pump it up?  Right?  Wrong.<br /><br />I found the recording unendurable - if you can listen to \\"Bye Bye Love\\" and not cringe you have a stronger constitution than I do and there's more where that came from<br /><br />Intrigued, I went back to those profound reviews. What I found on closer inspection ( checking the \\"See my other reviews\\" ) was that most came from let's say \\"professional reviewers\\". Typical was one hack who gives nothing but five star ratings to the likes of  Zesta \\"arousal oil\\",  a flea killer for your dog, incense, a set of Pinzon queen size sheets, Woman's Day magazine, Guinness pewter mugs, the singing group (?) Il Volo, Lipoflavonoid ( that he says \\"stopped the ringing in his ears\\") and so on.<br /><br />So that explains the over the top reviews. Now what is wrong with the album? It must be said that at the time it was released it was as touted a \\"revelation\\". A black man justifiably famous for his R&B and soul diving into a previously all white genre - especially in the midst of the civil rights struggle - was daring to say the least. A bold and admirable move on Charles part and at the time of it's release no doubt was a startling addition to what was then main stream popular music. The underlying connotations of exposing a previously oblivious audience of mostly well educated white people to, even then, a great R&B/soul artist and at the same time to classic C&W music justifies it's iconic place among the great albums. That, however does not mean it has survived - listening wise - the test of time.<br /><br />All you have to know about this album is it was mostly recorded in Hollywood so Ray could be backed up by movie studio musicians. The same people that made the music for the long forgotten movies of that time. The \\"Jack Halloran Singers\\"  pitched in, backed up by the Marty Paich \\"strings\\" and  ably accompanied by what was described as a \\"swinging horn section\\" (the Raeletts appear on only two of the songs here). Dig out your vinyl of that crowd belting out \\"Unchained Melody\\" or \\"There's A Summer Place\\" and see how long you can endure it. Trust me, the era of soaring violins accompanied by a chorus of heavenly angels is gone and it ain't coming back. And that's what we have here, heart wrenching songs whose heart has been surgically removed and a soul singer who has sold out his soul to achieve a sound that matched the vapid society it was pitched to.<br /><br />But you say, it topped the album charts for 14 weeks. Let's look at the competition to see what it took to to be top dog in 1962. There are tens, if not hundreds, of of sites that rank singles and albums from that time - take your pick but to give you a taste of what the public connected with musically  \\"West Side Story\\" had just finished a 53 week run as the top selling album and finished number one for the year.  Ray did finish #2 beating out albums in the top ten by Bob Dylan (new on the scene) and some definite lesser lights like Oscar Peterson Trio and Dexter Gordan. Others he clipped included Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd and Henry Mancini.  To put it in a larger context, unfortunately this set ranks poorly in albums from the 60's. Amazon puts it #56 for the decade.<br /><br />Well, what about those four top ten singles it spun off?  Even though those singles sold well for a while Billboard ranked one title at #24 and another at #31 in 1962  - that was way down the list from the top tune \\"Stranger On The Shore\\" by Archer Bilk (honest). Other artists who pushed Ray down the list, though he did best Burl Ives and Walter Brennan, included immortals like Dee Dee Sharp, Shelly Fabare, Little Eva, and David Rose.  Again, all you need toknow is though they do show up occasionally on some cd's not one single from this recording appears on  the 40 songs included in \\"The Very Best of Ray Charles\\" compilation.<br /><br />Though touted by our Amazon reviewers as a great breakout/turning point for Ray's career it was in fact 40 years before he had another number one album so he hardly set the music world on fire as a result of this episode and he soon went back to doing what he did wonderfully well. Thank goodness.<br /><br />The point of course is that no one listens to to West Side Story anymore. Nor Stan Getz or Mel Torme, the  Jack Halloran Singers, Dee Dee Sharp, David Rose, or even Archer Bilk. We don't walk down the street anymore chanting \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\".<br /><br />Popular tastes have come so far and music from that era is now so outdated as to make it for all practical purposes unlistenable.<br /><br />Ray Charles was a  transformative influence in American music and should be remembered for the best that he did not for what even one reviewer at the time labelled \\"kitsch.\\"<br /><br />Buy this cd for it's historical importance (which is why I gave it a two star rating) but not to listen to.know is though they do show up occasionally on some cd's not one single from this recording appears on  the 40 songs included in \\"The Very Best of Ray Charles\\" compilation.<br /><br />Though touted by our Amazon reviewers as a great breakout/turning point for Ray's career it was in fact 40 years before he had another number one album so he hardly set the music world on fire as a result of this episode and he soon went back to doing what he did wonderfully well.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have followed Michael Buble for several years.<br />We have several of his CD's and I'm always on the<br />look-out for his next new one to come out.
0345529057|5.0|I love the case the books come in, keeps them nice and organized.<br /><br />Some book series I've ordered that are designed after the TV series/movie comes out have had lots of misspellings in them and typos but there none of those that I noticed in this series. The books were good quality paperback and arrived really quickly!<br /><br />The series itself was immersive and I really liked it. It took me a while to get through them all which makes it well worth the price!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is not my usual genre, I am more into Sci-Fi and Action, but Downton Abbey has got me hooked.  Everything from the costumes, to the actors to the scenery.  Everything about this show looks and feels so authentic.  I never did get into other period dramas, but there is something special about this show.  Everyone that I introduced it to has fallen in love with it.<br /><br /> It's available for streaming only on Amazon VOD as they have an exclusive deal and the seasons are free with Prime membership.  Do yourself a favor and start at the beginning.  Brilliant show.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|this was a witty take on the writing process.  it brought some the best literary minds to life.  i am not a fan of woody allen.  i will add this to my collection. such a sweet ending
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this game. It has multi player and single player, and you can change the difficulty and everything. You should totally get this app!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was the second best book I have read. The best part about this book was that there were surprises at every corner
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its great but can be a little challenging all in all it is a pretty good game but ive played better
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to play, good jumps, nice control, awsome sound when it flips. Good fun for all ages 6 yrs to 36 yrs.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|I get the same thing, always a white screen.  Works great on Android phone, but utterly useless on kindle fire hd.  Just get a white screen, just like everyone else.  Any help from WD would bet wonderful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is addictive the first time I plated it I thought it was terrible<br />then I played it again and again and it got addictive I love it u should buy it it's worth the money
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This case is very protective and does just what I wanted it to. I can sit and read a book or watch a movie or show and don't have to worry about holding the tablet. I like the option of being able to have it horizontal or vertical. The case has been very durable as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's so challenging and fun I Have to check everywhere just to make sure there's nothing left and sometimes takes me a few days but I always get it and then think wow it was that easy
1611138434|5.0|well written,narrator was great. exciting and suspensfull just would make a great movie I was actually yelling screaming at the kid.i was angry at the mom until after completing it and thinking of the mental strength it took not to go insane and maintain hope.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|I liked this movie but it could be more real then it was. There was some sene's in it that made me jump out ofmy seat! And then there was some that just didn't make sence. I would tell people to see it at the movies before buying it!!!!!!!!!
1455113549|3.0|slow but some suspense. I wanted more insight into Jacobs behavior with his friends and more info on his granddad
B005LAIH2C|3.0|This movie wasn't long enough and didn't have much action in it. I wouldn't buy it again I like Horror movies. and this movie wasn't even scary. Sorry to say!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Oh my Gosh!!!!!  I could not believe this book.  I read the ending three times.  I shouted &#34;NO WAY&#34; when I was all by myself reading.  The writer makes you feel like you KNOW the characters.  You develop a relationship with the characters.  This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I highly recommend reading this.  Do not miss out!!  And have a friend read it at the same time so you can talk about it with someone.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|Now this movie I really liked.Everyone should get this movie if you like scary movies!! It was better then the first Sient Hill that came out but I have them all.
0767903374|5.0|Highly recommend for those traversing the world where they don't feel they don't fit in....now I know what I was called a cry-baby growing up.  Well I still am, but am now proud of being ME.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Now this is a great movie I would buy it again. I watch all my movies on line before I get them. And I bought this movie can't wait to watch it again. Get It!!! you'll love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its the perfect mix of a challenge and fun. its totally fun. if you like a challenge I recommend it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I wasn't sure about purchasing a used DVD but took the chance. The DVD was rated in &#34;excellent condition&#34;. Played the DVD and it played as good as new. My grandson loves the movie.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|A nice compilation of their unique application on some well-loved & popular tunes.<br />Their sometimes whimsical textures make the music a really delight to listen to.<br />I hope they can do more Broadway music interpretations.<br />Thank you, Piano Guys, for giving me something to look forward to.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I was very excited to purchase the Study Bible.  But it does not work.  The Book and App lock up every time I try to use or read it. I would not recommend it.  I will try another study Bible app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this app wasn't too easy where u got bored. at times the levels stomped me. wish there were more levels.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I ordered this movie for a friend, and as we watched the movie, we did not realize that it was gonna be so good. Real men sacrifice their lives on the daily for our country, and this movie displays real and true acts of valor.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I recommend because it makes &#34;mind craft&#34; more fun.  Download this and have yourself a good time playing mind craft.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Got this as a gift for someone, however I ended up watching some of it as well.  WOW.  I was amazed by the restoration and the work they did.  I now plan to rewatch this entire series on blu-ray!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Graphics were terrible, not fun or entertaining at all.  i definitely would not recommend this game. It's boring and you won't like it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I ordered this product for use with Windows 8 64-bit (Surface Pro) when my original Prolific product (due to old chipset) failed to work. When the item arrived, I went to the website, downloaded the driver and plugged-in the adapter. It worked on first try. No muss no fuss. The price is good and the product is well made. I would gladly recommend this to others with similar needs (64-bit Windows support in a USB-serial adapter).
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|We put off renting this movie for several weeks assuming that it would not be any good.  WRONG..this is the best movie we have seen in a long time.  Good action, the character doesn't do stupid things and the movie is based on a good story, not some sub plot of a love story.  Lots of action and has clean language.  Tom Cruise did a great job and we are not huge Cruise fans.
B001ENS0BI|3.0|While season 1 and 2 were good, season 4 was pretty far fetched.  To much was squeezed in and made the show less than captivating.
B0027MJU00|3.0|First let me say I loved Sharp Objects and Gone Girl. So much so that I'm sure I'll buy anything this author writes in the future. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this book didn't grab me the way Flynn's other stories have. There is a fascinating, dark story here, and great characterization, but the shifting between characters' points of view didn't work well for me in this book, primarily because some of the point of view characters didn't feel important enough at the time I was reading them. I wound up being bored and skimming, especially in Patty's sections. I agree with some other reviewers that characters were not sympathetic and difficult to root for. I did like their complexity, though. Another minor issue is that I read this as a Kindle version on my Kindle for ipad and the formatting was off in several places. Normally, I wouldn't complain about formatting issues but since I paid TEN dollars for a Kindle version I think it should have been free of these types of issues.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this novel, even though it is incredibly sad. Many more characters are involved than his previous novels, but all are compelling. The choices made by one family at the beginning of the novel haunt many of the characters throughout the novel. Well worth the wait.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Great book by one of the masters of fantasy. Drizzt will go down as one of the enduring characters of our generation.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was an amazing read!!! I can't believe it's taken me so long to start this series. After the Red Wedding episode on HBO I was tired of surprises so I started reading A Song of Ice and Fire and finished it in 2 weeks. On to the next one!!! Bravo, George Martin!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really have to think. Lots of fun. Looking forward to more rooms in the very near future, please. Can't wait.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This don't work.  Why would I want a camera that could only take pictures of myself.  Had I know this kindle did not have to ability to take photos I would not have asked for it.  In order to use this as instructed, I would need to be standing on my head.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book & never was able to put it down. I am excited to read the next one.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Very slow, if you like a pic the  screen jumps back up several frames and when you scroll back down to teh pic it wasnt liked. Changing profile pics doesnt work 3/4 of the time. It will just randomly start back at the top of new posts with out warning which is very frustarting iof you are catching up on stuff on your wall and are now waaaay back up at the top of your wall.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Totally inaccurate flying sequences. The Pilot. from where this has been ripped off was a million times better. Denzel Washington comes across as a buffoon. no airline would have hired him.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is an inspiring thought provoking book. All women especially those in their early 20s should take time and read this gem.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Cool sounds and great to fall asleep or just relax. My girlfriend likes using it for reading too. Buy it for sure!
B000U6BT40|5.0|Love the characters.  Love the humor. A fun series to watch and enjoy.  Great show for the whole family. Get it now!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|excellent kindle lightweight micro shell case fits and looks excellent.  Will protect device.  I would recommend.  Very pleased with purchase.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Perfect to distribute to my kindles. On the main computer I maintain the Original versions of the information then send it to my kindles (children).
0547258305|5.0|I loved Kristin Cashore's creative idea of Graceling's and their different powers.  Some of the Graceling's skills make me laugh.<br /><br />Very enjoyable read.  However, I liked \\"Fire\\" even more.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the main character's personality seems almost exactly like the girl in the \\"Throne of Glass\\" books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. Its challenging and creative and I can't wait for new levels. Check it out.
B000J10ERO|2.0|Were do I start; Superman Returns was a dissapointment for the fans as well as the big studio honchos. Eventually,  even they'd had to admit it wasn't a first-class product for the franchise. If you like action films, this film is a two hit wonder because there's only two action sequences through out the whole movie period! The first one is Superman rescuing a a falling jet plane, the second one is him going up against a crazed gatling machine gun wielding mad man on the roof of a building, and that's about it! On the flip side let's say you like those to action scenes well, you can go on YouTube and watch them all day long over and over again, and that would be all your getting from this movie. Furthermore, if you like your Superman to fly around on screen for about an hour and a half doing absolutely nothing this films for you. As I've mentioned above my title 1978's version was a truly a classic, God bless the late actor Christopher Reeve for making Superman honorable, and not just a joke on the big screen. Alas, also in 1978 there was a much better Lex Luthor played by the brilliant actor Gene Hackman I think he got an Acad emy Award nomination for his role. Now I do not mean to sound harsh on the cast of Superman Return Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey which is a outstanding actor by far deserved better than this. They all did commendable jobs with what they had, which wasn't much. The plot line is dumb Superman get's a wild hair in his ass and decides to go back to his home planet of Krypton for what!?...  I have know idea? No, problem  it just takes five years to get there and back. He finds out there's nothing left of the place it's all destroyed and in ruins much like our own planet. Any way once he gets back he falls head over heels  in love again  with Lois Lane aka Kate Bosworth, on top of that they have this weird love child together. However, she's engaged to be married or already married I forgot its been along time since I've seen this movie. Superman spends most of the movie ogling and gawking at her and thinking about her basically being sprung on her the whole duration of the film. They made it into some dumb love story great! And, what is with this love child subplot it's just a waste of time. Superman should be doing what he does the best saving peoples lives and taking down the bad guys. This is what you get when you have a studio and a director that doesn't know there source material from a hole in the wall, this movie ended up being flatlined before it ever came alive.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a great read with some really good witty dialogue.  This is a perfect book to read as an escape from the daily grind.
B00005KB9T|5.0|This was the Wailers breakthrough album.  Every track on this album is a classic.  While the lyrics are often political, the religious aspects of reggae are toned down and the direct threats of confrontation are absent.  It isn't a solely political album, though, there are a number of love songs.  It's more of a collaborative album as well than a Bob Marley work; Peter Tosh even wrote and sang a couple on this one.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|great; quick charge for my IPhone5; conveniently stored in my car's glove box; don't know how I managed without it for this long
B00005KB9R|4.0|This is the last Wailers' album with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  This album, like the ones before, features concerns for social justice with a religious bent; but in this album the call is for more direct confrontation in songs like \\"Get up Stand up\\" and \\"Burnin' and a Lootin'.\\"<br /><br />The well known hits on this album are spectacular, the rest of the album is solid, but not as good as the previous release, \\"Catch a Fire.\\"  \\"Burnin'\\" was released just six months after \\"Catch a Fire,\\" so it's impressive that the album is as good as it is.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Being a big Downton Abbey fan, I had to have this to complete the series so far. Maggie Smith is my favorite actress in the series.If you love the Downton Abbey this is a must for you film library.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|It's cute but it got too repetitive.  I had fun playing it for a while but got bored with it pretty quickly
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|An interesting and fun form of Mahjong.  One you will enjoy playing. The graphics add a punch, and the colors are nice.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  Starts out at a good pace so you can catch on, gets faster and more challenging but still really fun.
0307352153|4.0|Exceptionally researched and unpretentiously written, Cain's book appeals to the cerebral, introspective, and reflective side of all of us, drawing attention to the ways in which American culture tends to favor extroverts despite the enormous contributions to society made by introverts. My only hope is that this book will reach people across the intro-extrovert spectrum, and not just to quiet people seeking to read about the accomplishments of quiet leaders.  Full review available at FlounderingThoughts.wordpress.com.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I loved this at first.  The graphics are beautiful.  Played for several days, but it soon became obvious that you would have to purchase \\"pearls\\" (with real money) in order to beat challenges and advance.  There are ways to earn free pearls, but it would take an extremely long time to have enough to get anything good and get through the challenges.  For instance,  you have to have \\"rare\\" plants to attract a rare fish.  It cost 10 pearls to grow a rare plant and the rare fish only produces one pearl every 3 days.  I got frustrated and removed it from my kindle fire.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Just a great movie, in my opinion. Not a big Cher fan but she was good in the role she played.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book also keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The way he writes will make you read all of his books twice.
0307730700|5.0|What a fantastic story of a real hero. Very inspirational, Im going to hand it off to my son to read next. This is a book that should be passed on and on.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|IT'S A COOL GAME WITH MANY DIFFERENT PUZZLE GAMES AND AN INTRIGUING<br />Story that keeps the mood and intrigue alive
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Luv it!!! So many games to choose from! My children play for hours! The more you play the more games you can unlock!
B0082Z447U|3.0|It was a good ghost story but not very scary.  I would recommend for a quick read to kill time.
B002RI9M2U|3.0|Asher accomplish the task of getting readers attention almost immediately, but when i finished it I was left with a feeling of not really understanding the main character, it ocurrs ti me that she had too many options, alternatives, etc etc. Perhaps her inner suffering was not very well portrayed.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I have always loved this book and the movies it has inspired. Find a quiet spot and you will find it hard to put down.
B002R5V7MG|5.0|The passion of Dudamel in his conducting has led to a superlative performance. An exception recording and heartily to be recommended.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is awesome tons of upgrades hard to beat and cool characters.BUT it takes to long to regain soles! Which is in multiplayer otherwise boss.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this and am looking forward to playing the new levels when they become available. Hope it's not long!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Enjoyed this book, but the two intertwining plot ideas made it too long for its own good. Really love Stephen King's style.  And despite the length, I read every word.
B005FISBTO|1.0|The video and the audio did not quite match. It was annoying, but I watched it because it's a good series.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|It's a good-looking watch and it worked just fine, at least until I laid it aside for about a day, whereupon it stopped cold.  Glad to say  it revived after a minute or two back on my wrist, but then I had to reset date and time.  It will now be my constant companion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When I first stated reading this book I thought i was going to be a love story like all the rest but it wasn't it is a really good book....just when you think life is good for her it changes....it also show women no matter what situation you are end there is a way out no matter how bad it is!!! This book is a really good read....I enjoyed every min of it.....once I started reading it I couldn't put it down!!!! Five start book!!!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Another novel of perfection.  Nalini Singh 's \\"heart of obsidian\\" reveals who the ghost is along with a reveal of who the real power is in the psynet.  I sincerely hope she will be writing more in this series as I just can't bear to let go of it yet.  The stories she tells with each novel in the series keep me coming back for more and this new novel is no exception.  While I can hardly wait to get to the end of any of her stories, I always dread the end because I know it will be awhile before the next one comes out.  I'm glad I stumbled onto this series and finally getting the answers I've been anxiously awaiting is a relief and a joy.
B007R21JJK|5.0|This board has my i5-3570K running at 4.7GHz stable and could go higher if I had better a H2O cooling setup. It would be quite nice if the board had heatsinks for the top mosfets, not just the side ones. I think that the fan headers should be more top located, but an extender or some rerouting solves the issue perfectly. The mSATA feature is certainly neat, but it's better to just get a 2.5in SSD than one of the tiny ones that fit mSATA. I enjoy the fact that, if I wanted, I could add more power to the PCIe lanes via a SATA power connector for higher clock speeds.<br /><br />Edit:  I now have an i7-3770k running in this at 4.7ghz stable on a hyper 212+ and a gtx 780 Killing games. The sata pci power connector is a bit to flimsy to use, but I doubt I need it any way.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app.  The colors and graphics are great!  I do wish there was more instructs to the game and it was easier to earn the pearls.  Overall a great experience.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My oldest daughter found so many cool ideas for her own home...that I decided to look for myself.  I am not one for social media, but I am definitely hooked on Pinterest!
B00CI21EBC|5.0|The Heavies never disappoint. Excellence as always and the band sounds better than ever. This album was truly worth the wait!
1439190275|5.0|I like the scientific research backing up conclusions.  I have reached the same conclusions over time (non scientific but experiential)<br /><br />As a diabetic, I thought ahh so, no wonder diabetics have trouble losing weight.<br /><br />Being on a diet that is ADA sanctioned it has at least twice the carbs that I should be eating.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My niece enjoyed this game. Not too hard or too easy for a child. She was glad to figure out things om her own.<br />gave a sense of accomplishment.<br />I also enjoyed the game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I LOVED IT VERY MUCH. WHEN YOU ADD MORE LEVELS PLEASE ADD HINTS, SO WE CAN FINISH ALL LEVELS WHEN THEY GET MORE DIFFICULT. IF I HAVE TO PAY FOR LEVELS, I WILL NOT BUY IF THERE ARE NO HINTS. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FINISH THEM. I TOOK A STAR FOR THAT.
B00181JGI2|4.0|Very entertaining to me, has it reminded me of my past friendships I always thought there was one in every crowd. but in this case there are three. I do recommend this film
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|John Fogerty proves he still has it!! His voice sounds great, and really nice to hear him with other stars of today on some of his greatest hits!!<br /><br />Loved it!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|would have given it five stars for simply being fun, addictive, and MLP related. but it EATS up my kindle's battery like its nothing and it's rough trying to get it to work with facebook without crashing.<br />I say all that but I'm still unable to put it down.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I keep seeing the debate that, &#34;this isn't rock and roll!&#34;. It's funny that anyone could even begin to clearly define a genre for this album. They have certainly grown as a band. (even if their lead singer has shrunken down a bit.) They have blended every element I like from the rock and pop genres. Not as much Punk sound that I would have imagined. Punk makes me think of the Sum41's and such. That is NOT what this album sounds like.<br /><br />I can't say that they're going to save Rock and Roll. But I get their message. I love the sound.. Love his voice, love their lyrics and I even like the music videos. I was never really a Fall Out Boy fan prior to this. The last time I heard of them they had Sugar We're Going Down Swinging out... or something or other. The growth they've made since then, is unbelievable.
193700788X|5.0|I can't believe this is the last book!  Every year I look forward to the next one, and read it in one day.<br />The books are better than HBO!
0062255657|5.0|I could rant and rave about the myriad things I love about this story, but I'd like to keep this short.<br /><br />I don't read much, and when I do, it isn't for extended periods of time.<br />When I finally had the privilege of reading this book, I sat down and read it.<br />All of it.<br />And once I finished?<br />I read it again.<br /><br />Do yourself a kindness and enjoy the visceral experience that is this book.<br />You deserve it.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I loved this season.  The reason I'm rating it only 3 stars is because of the Showtime promo at the beginning.  IT SHOWS THE SEASON CLIFFHANGER!!  I don't have Showtime, so I watch each season by buying them, this was a huge spoiler!  Also this season's cliffhanger was the biggest thing to ever happen on this show!  I was really upset that the promo, that you can't skip, was a spoiler to the whole season.  Poor planning from Showtime's marketing team.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think this game is fun to play.  The challenges have a good variety and the graphics details are interesting to look at.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Once again a great story written by an amazing author.  I gratis is the end of this tale, and I have to start up his next story line.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this was a trilogy but it's not and I can't tell you how happy I am that I get more Gideon and Eva.  I wasn't able to put the book down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is my favorite way to pass the time. It's unbelievably addicting and just plain fun. This is a must buy.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|It must be tiring for people to hate on her but they are still checking her out. Hate it for ya, if you're a hater, you're a fan. I believe this is a really good concert. She did an awesome job! She is still in front of a crowd giving it her best and it shows through her success from the beginning of her career till now. Her fans are her drive and that includes the haters. She has never let me down yet. Even when everyone talked about her VMA performance in 07, I still watched it. There are so many performers these days who could sing live through the whole show but that wouldn't keep me entertained. Britney loves her fans, who in turn love her back and that is why she is highest on the totem pole for my favorite of all time.<br /><br />Be sure to check this out! It is simply amazing what she can do. Pretty as a picture and Southern as sweet tea. Love always Britney!!
1596438274|4.0|It's a really fun book and I enjoyed the comic format. There's no new material here for readers of Feynman's Tales of a Curious Character or those who read Genius by James Gleick, but the old material is presented in a novel, entertaining manner.<br /><br />The artwork kinda bugged me as I'm used to Spigelman and Miller's graphic novel style with very polished, highly-developed artwork. This one looked more like a series of cocktail doodles, but maybe that added some sort of silent commentary on the subject matter.<br /><br />Regardless, it's a good, topical intro to Feynman's life that will likely spur nascent Feynman fans to move on to tackle some of his other works.
1439153663|1.0|This book was selected for my book club.  The person who selected it had not read it beforehand.  I was excited because of all the 5 star reviews and the subject matter.  How disappointing it turned out.  The characters were flat.  Years would be skipped but nothing, apparantly, changed for any of the characters. One example: the main white character, who was raised with/by the slaves, is shocked that she can no longer be affectionate to slaves (after living in town for 2 years as a priviledged white woman) when she returns home.  Really?!  The author tried so hard to make one white slave owner be worthy of admiration and understanding we joked that it was surprising the author didn't have them singing while they toiled in the fields.  We actually read this quite a few months ago but I felt I had to add to the reviews to try to balance out all of the 5 stars.  There was a lot we picked apart (and that actually made for a good book club meeting) but our summary was: not worth the time.
B002G1K82Q|1.0|This movie was so disappointing I could barely get through it. The music sucked and the acting was horrible. If I were you I'd take it off the shelf.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Where has this guy been hiding?  Love every disc I have, five and counting.  Would like to see him live.
1452101248|5.0|The photos are absolutely GORGEOUS! Makes you want to try every recipe. I did try some and they made a very creative and unusual presentation for guests. Makes veggies more appealing.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Not a clunker track in the lot-vintage (really) Hendrix.  Felt like I was back in college, rounds out my 33 1/3 Hendrix collection.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I got this with Free App of the Day and is my &#34;go to game&#34; right now. I would buy more levels but power ups do not apply here, you must use your brain to solve these. Which box should you smash first when there are 8 boxes? The second one? When do you explode the bomb? Each level introduces a new character with new physics.  The three star scoring is similar to &#34;fling birds and cut string&#34; type games and you are allowed to navigate back to attempt a perfect score.  The graphics are sharp and movements slightly comical, not annoying.  I have had it two days and have one more level, hopefully the developer is working on more.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a really fun game that anybody can play. My little four year old girl just loves this game.
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|I was intrigued by the storyline of the first SH so I thought this one might be worth a rental...it wasn't.  Besides the crappy acting, plot holes, and \\"huh?\\" moments already mentioned I would like to pose 2 questions: if the Order is powerful enough to control the Otherworld and Silent Hill itself, why do they need this stupid amulet and the girl?  And, why the heck does the town have an amusement park????  \\"Ok kids, strap those gas masks on tight coz we're riding Pyramid Head carousel next\\".  Stupid!

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Although I attended one of these tour stops, it was great to relive the wonderful experience again. It is so inspiring to hear such enthusiasm and harmony from a group that has been around for over 50 years at a time when one year can be considered a career.

B00DF0POXA|4.0|While I am a Kanye West fan, I can also be open-minded and admit to his shortcomings. I feel that every album (with the exception of 808s) has been an improvement over the last, however, this album in my opinion doesn't exceed what he did with Dark Fantasy. I wouldn't even say its better than Watch the Throne. Make no mistake, this is a very solid album though.<br /><br />The production quality of this album is indeed top-notch as expected. Kanye took a different approach to the sounds and beats he used on this album, straying away from his usual string orchestra and choir infused beats. This album has a very distinct sound that resembles electronica a lot, which may or may not appeal to some of his fans.<br /><br />The lyrical content of this album holds substance for the most part, which is a welcome break from what we are used to on hip-hop radio stations. Songs like &#34;Black Skinhead&#34;, &#34;Guilt Trip&#34; (my favorite) and &#34;New Slaves&#34; amongst a few others are what I am speaking of in particular. Then you have a couple of songs that seem to be meant for club/party atmospheres. There is a good balance songs though.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very good album that I would recommend to anyone into this genre of music.

1878424319|5.0|A new way of looking at everyday occurences.  The four agreements on the surface look easy but are difficult to really understand and more difficult to put into use.

1608871517|4.0|The book itself has a very weak biding. After only one read-through (and mind you I'm very gentle on my books, as an avid collector) the binding has split. This is causing the pages to shift around and look like they may fall out. I would think for a book that has a list price of $45 would have a lot better quality.<br /><br />When I first pulled this book out of the box I was a bit stunned by the sheer size of it, it's a coffee-table book. The slip cover has Michael's Badd Tour opener coat embossed on the front. Underneath the slip cover is what looks like a drawer pulled out of Michael Bush's workshop with little bits and baubles, tour buttons and all sorts of things that go into MJ's costumes. It's a nice little touch that makes the book eye catching to look at, with or without the cover.<br /><br />Regarding the content, I learned so much I never knew. I never thought so much time and effort went into every little detail about Michael's clothes. Every page was fascinating. The full color pictures are pure eye candy. I found myself staring at the pictures and looking at every detail. I wont spoil the book for you but Bush reveals interesting tricks they used in the way they cut and fit Michael's clothes to function for him as a dancer. It even shows a famous rhinestone glove and rhinestone socks in progress.<br /><br />Michael Bush is a good writer, and was obviously a very good friend to Michael. I love the funny little anecdotes on MJ's pranks and antics. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. The passion both these men had for their work practically leaps off the page.<br /><br />I've been eyeing this book for quite awhile, debating on whether or not to buy it. I'm so glad I did. It's a must read for fans, or even non-fans fascinated by costume. Read it, you wont regret it!<br /><br />EDIT: I complained to Amazon about the damaged book and they approved a replacement right away (I'm expecting it tomorrow, actually.) Amazon was swift in handling thesituation. Hopefully the next copy of this book does not have the same issue of the weak binding.

0765350386|5.0|Mistborn: The Final Empire is a fantasy story about the oppressed skaa who finally take a stand to overthrow the Lord Ruler, God and King of the Final Empire. A band of skaa thieves, each with special allomantic powers, come together and make plans for the rebellion. Among them is a young woman named Vin who discovers that she is a Mistborn, a person with all the allomancy powers. Vin, who grew up in thieving crews that beat her, must learn to trust in her new friends and herself as she uses her new powers to infiltrate the nobility of Luthadel. The rebellion leader, a man named Kelsier, has become a legend as he is the only person to ever survive the terrible Pits of Hathsin. He is the one who will train Vin to become a full blown Mistborn as he destoys the Final Empire.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson is a brilliant writer who really draws you into the world of his novels. Mistborn is no different. It is obvious that Sanderson put a lot of thought into creating the fantasy world of swirling mists. Each scene is full of precise and enticing imagery. There is a full history to the world Sanderson imagined which gives it more depth and makes it more believable to readers. Not ony is the world of the book full of depth but the characters are as well. Kelsier's vision is so bold, especially after the struggle he has been through, that you cannot help but see him as an amazing leader. Vin's growth from a mistrusting thief to a trusting, most powerful Mistborn captures readers and holds them on the edge of their seats. Readers will empathize with the skaa and root for the rebellion to actually accomplish the overthrow of the Final Empire.<br /><br />Of course it would not be a fantasy without some sort of paranormal/magical occurence and in this case it would be the powers of Allomancers and Feruchemists. Allomancy and Feruchemy are unique forms of power. The use of metals as a power source creates an interesting twist for an already creative setting. There is a story behind these powers but it is only implied throughout the first book, which will make readers want to finish the whole series to discover the hidden mysteries. It is not just the mystery of the powers that intrigues readers, there are other mysteries such as the Deepness and the Inquisitors. By the end of the series all the mysteries are answered and the answers are astonishing.<br /><br />Anyone who loves fantasy and adventure will love the Mistborn trilogy. The first book will have you begging to know more. The end of the series had this reader in tears and excitement. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.d these powers but it is only implied throughout the first book, which will make readers want to finish the whole series to discover the hidden mysteries.

0380729407|4.0|Ray Bradbury creates a very interesting fantasy come to life in his book Something Wicked This Way Comes. A dark, evil carnival comes to Green Town, Illinois looking both to entertain and feed on souls. Jim and Will, are two young boys who get drawn into the plots of the evil carnival and must find a way out. The prologue drew me into the book before the story even began. There is a sense of excitement that put me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen before I was even put into the first scene. The excitement kept up throughout the whole novel which rarely had spots without some kind of action happening. The writing however seemed disjointed and odd at times. It was more of a stream of consciousness type of writing at times.<br /><br />The story was fun and creepy all at the same time but there also were a few philisophical life lessons that come into play and made me, as a reader, stop and think. The first thoughts came about in chapter 28. Charles Halloway, Will's father, is talking about happiness and has this to say, \\"Sometimes the man who looks happiest in town, with the biggest smile, is the one carrying the biggest load of sin....On the other hand, that unhappy, pale, put-upon man walking by, who looks all guilt and sin, why, often that's your good man with a capital G.\\" I found this to be interesting, that Charles believed being a good person meant you had to miss out of the fun things in life that could make one happy but to do those things is sinful. Sinners have more fun and do not worry about consequences and therefore they are happy. Being good is a burden. Charles learns at the end that being a good person does not mean that you cannot be happy. Good tends to reap more rewards than the sinful. The carnival folk live off the pain and despair of people because they cannot make their own life but Charles does not need to live off others' misfortunes because he makes his own happiness. It is that happiness and laughter that eventually defeats the carnival. Which brings me to two of my favorite scenes in the book.<br /><br />The Witch is ordered to kill Charles, who is really the hero of the story and not the two boys. As the Witch is trying to cast a spell to stop his heart, Charles starts to laugh. The laughing startles the Witch and frightens her. Charles lets out a huge roar of laughter and the Witch's hands and face are literally burned. She runs off screaming leaving her task unfinished. Later Charles appears at the carnival and volunteers for a trick. It will appear that Charles shot the Witch but she caught the bullet in her mouth. One bullet is ready and placed in her mouth while a wax bullet is given to Charles. He uses a knife to carve a cresent into the bullet. He tells the Witch that the cresent is his smile. He shoots her with the wax bullet and she dies. The wax bullet should not have actually done anything except smoke, but it was the smile that killed the Witch. Charles defeated the darkness with happiness.<br /><br />I am sure Bradbury did not mean for the book to be interrepted as I imagined but here is how I saw it. The evil carnival represents a darkness, a darkness called depression. Charles even admits he is depressed. But in the end he defeats the dark, evil carnival with his laughter and happiness. Even when it seemed Jim was dead, Charles and Will had to create their own happiness to end the whole ordeal and bring Jim back to life. It just goes to show that anyone can defeat their own darkness, whether it be depression or not, if only they can find some way to smile and laugh, for happiness is the only weapon against darkness. Sometimes you just have to create your happiness though, even when it seems there is none to find. By defeating the carnival, Charles defeated his own depression.<br /><br />Overall I loved the book, more for the lessons I got than the story. I found the imagery to be interesting and would love to see it on film. I know there is a movie but I think a newer version should come out to really bring out the creepiness. I give the book 4 out of 5 stars.hink a newer version should come out to really bring out the creepiness. I give the book 4 out of 5 stars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game works fine and I would recommend this game for everyone. this is the game I play the most on my kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game! each room / level flows nicely to the next. so far no bugs or issues with game play. sound or clucks are very low
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Well built and light frame great for on the go shoots.  Mount my gopro on it as well my DSLR, smooth with its grip movements and nice access to screw mount for additional add ons.  Great for following on actions on skateboarding, skiing and any other action sport activities.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I'm not a fan of violence for the sake of violence.  This series is consistently well written and acted.  Given the main plot, it is surprisingly not full of blood and guts.  The blood is necessary to the story and never gratuitous.  Thanks to the producers!
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|I enjoyed the cd but it made a bunch of the oldies sound quite different which was the intent of the cd.  I liked it but I liked the oldies better from CCR.  I would still recommend it as it was fun to listen to.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is another great movie by Alex Kendrick.  We have all of their movies and encourage all families to watch them for encouragement and entertainment.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It's a bit of predictable fluff... that I would see again whenever I just want to feel better about people and/or their efforts.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I still listen the old albums...<br /><br />This one is just not good at all...  Hope they will do better next time...
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|You will need to pay close attention to follow all the switches in time and story lines, but, once you do, the messages of the movie are stellar and so is the acting.  Be sure to watch the credits for all the parts each of the stars play.  I certainly missed a few and these are some of my favorite stars!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I watched this movie just because I paid for it. Wish I would have watched the trailer first. Too bad I can't get a refund for it.
B00BI745AA|2.0|How can you make these stars so dirty and ugly?  Of course, it's great acting and great music but, really... did it need to be so dark?

B00005JM02|5.0|I purchased a book from Dave and the postal service lost it in transit.  Dave offered to reimburse me or send me another book at his expense.  Since it was not his fault, i offered to pay 1/2 of the shipping.  I was positively shocked when I received a new book where Dave paid for the shipping and on top of that, a full refund was inside the book.  That was above and beyond what i consider OUTSTANDING customer service and Dave has earned my business as long as I shop.  Do not hesitate to purchase from Dave, he is easy to get a hold of and responds quickly and follows through.  Just plain OUTSTANDING.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was riveted until the end! I couldn't put it down! Touching and sad! Best book I've read in a long time! Can't wait to see how the last 2 movies compare.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I was suprised by how close the storyline followed the book. There is definitely some deviation (especially towards the end of the movie) but they still managed to get the point across. A lot more action than I was expecting which was a nice suprise.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a challenging and sometimes frustrating (in a good way) game. I hope it doesnt take too long for some new levels to come out. Only thing I didn't like was having to start a level over from the beginning if you had to exit out before you completed it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is the first King book I've read in probably 20 years.  I'd forgotten just how good his character development is.
0007466064|4.0|There really isn't much to say, you're either a huge fan of George R. R. Martin's Ice and Fire series or you've been living in a cave and haven't heard about it yet. This is part one of book 5 and there are two more on the way, each one will be around 1,500 pages so this one doesn't bring any closure, just more of the same. It's what you'd expect and it's great.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|You don't have to believe in ghosts to be thoroughly entertained and spooked by Ghost Radar. It's more hair-raising fun than a scary movie because you get to interact with the entities. If you enjoy scaring the bajeebers out of yourself and your friends, I highly recommend Ghost Radar. For some mysterious reason it seems to work best when you're home alone at night. Or better yet, if you're a teenage girl at a sleepover in a friend's old house. I really would not recommend using Ghost Radar if you're high. Mostly because smoking is bad.
B005USZML4|4.0|I have read two of the Theodore Boone series and enjoy them a lot.  One thing I appreciate is there is no bad language.  The stories hold my interest.  He is quite a young man and it is neat to see a young man like that gain the respect of his peers and the adults.

B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Great family movie-especially since it is based on an Alaskan true story!  A delightful and interesting show for all ages.
0393964582|1.0|I received the wrong version of the book with simply a sticker labeled in writing that said &#34; Frankenstein (Norton Critical Edition)&#34; on the back of the book which is the version I ordered. Of course this was not the book instead I received Frankenstein by Magnum publisher. Very disappointed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game because it a fun and challenging but also because if you get stuck there is help to keep you going.
B000002J6F|5.0|i've alway like steven stills. saw him once with csn, before young came aboard. i like his music, and lyrics. good cd.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|Apparently the author wanted to write a book, in fact wanted to write a series of books.  Since there are at least 2 other books with this same group of characters the author has met with at least partial success.  It is too bad that that instead of dashing off further installments she didn't put a bit more effort into this one, perhaps she should have put a whole lot more effort into this one.<br /><br />The basic premise is that a young woman from a well to do American family has traveled to Europe to look for her missing sister and niece.  We are supposed to believe that an otherwise intelligent woman has agreed to travel to an unfamiliar country where she barely speaks the language, to locate and retrieve a child she has never met and has no legal claim to, trusting completely in a man she had never met who had contacted her father offering to help, for a fee.  Seriously there are more plausible plots in most children's books.  Wouldn't the more believable course of action have been to contact the authorities to attempt to locate the missing woman and child?  Or at least hiring a private detective to search?<br /><br />The next bit of implausibility comes when we are to accept that the located child is then taken out of France and into the US with forged papers?  Just what did the family expect to do, use fake paperwork on this child for the rest of her life?  And a malnourished, mute child with no medical history arrives but the loving, responsible grandparents don't take her to a doctor for a complete exam so no one realizes the child has suffered repeated abuse?<br /><br />I could go on, but I don't want to spoil any plot points for anyone who might wish to read this, I'll just add that the Maggie and other characters have physical characteristics that change from page to page, that it does not seem to occur to Maggie that somebody who has a drug addiction should be checked into rehab, not left alone in an apartment.  There are many more which is quite frustrating because there is the possibility of a good story here, probably even a good series but the author really does need to take the time really work out the various plot points, to let the characters behave in logical manners.  At the very least just decide if the main character has green eyes or blue!

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was filled with wonderful characters and so many intertwning stories.  It was so interesting to learn about these people even though you know they were all fictional.  I am sure that some of the info was based on the author's heritage.  I would definitely recommend this book to all.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved how Martel wrote this fun tale by drawing in the reader through journalism.  The audio version is also awesome! The reader made the book really come alive!

B0000042MY|2.0|I was not aware there were two composers involved in the movie's soundtrack, and probably would not have cared one way or the other had this CD been produced as advertised.  But it is not a 'soundtrack' but rather a hash job...each composer's pieces clumped together so one can never get a sense of being 'in the movie', of following the action in one's mind.  Pity.  If anyone knows of the existence of a soundtrack CD that is truly that...sound that tracks the course of the movie...please email me.  This CD was a waste of money.

This is a great book, with wonderful insight into the technology, the Apple company and culture, but most of all Steve Jobs.  Throughout this book, I alternated between hating him and admiring him ... but you can't dispute the incredible impact he had on music, phones, and us!<br /><br />A true visionary who was taken from us way too soon.  This is a long book (great on the kindle), and I promise you ... you will love it and admire him, regardless of what you think about his products.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Sure there's a free version of this app, but the upgrade is more than worth the low price. You can see how much operating time you have left for each type of usage. You can see how you are using and manage your memory. No surprise power downs. This app is significant and useful enough that it's on my favorites key.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|Luttrell's story is pretty astonishing. In a nutshell - survival against all odds. The first half of the book focuses on his experience training for SEALS and the second half focuses on the events that took place during Operation Redwing. This isn't the most amazing writing but he managed (with the help of Patrick Robinson) to make it pretty darn good for being a non-writer. The story alone deserves a read.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Simultaneously frightening and enlightening view of food as mass produced entity.  Although I am not sure that was the point of the film, it was useful in discouraging meat intake, (especially considering studies showing vegetarians live longer).  Although I am not to that point yet, this film does make me look more carefully at my future food choices which is not something I can say about most films. It is likely after viewing this that I will cut back even more on meat intake and I will definitely buy more organic products. Although some big food processors declined to be interviewed, the filmmakers were fair in giving WalMart credit for the organic purchases they have made, showing they were willing to give positive reinforcement to big businesses making an effort to be more environmentally conscious. Unfortunately, most of the big meat processors don't fall in this category. I have to say I have not eaten chicken since watching this film although conditions in California have improved for the birds. The film is depressing but it also points out that consumers have the ultimate choice in deciding what to eat. At least the film gives you a better idea exactly what that is.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|The story line was good, the view was awesome! The acting sucked! I really expected a lot more but there wasn't!

B00CWY76CC|1.0|this is such a terrible game. there are no hints and the game got stuck on level 4. if you want a frustrating game then this is it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love the puzzles, feels good to figure it out and move to the next level. Warning: this game will make you obsess until you figure out how to move on!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Cannot wait for the next one! Fantastic book.  Was not dissapointed.  Kiera Cass knows how to keep you hanging! Loved it
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Despite the splintering of story lines and the lack of any real conclusions to any of them during the course of the season, it's still a wonderful and thought provoking TV show.
B0028ER4QE|1.0|I ordered this album on May 13 to receive it by June 30, my husband's birthday. The estimated shipping read June 12-21.<br />Today is June 24 and I've yet to receive anything! To add, I emailed the seller and requested a tracking number. They responded and said, \\"it was sent a long time ago.\\"<br />You can imagine how informative that was.<br />They have been of no help and I've received no album.<br />The only thing they're selling is wasted time, energy and money.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|This show was quite funny. We enjoyed watching it. The self reflection of the lead character was great.  And how to deal with parental issues was insightful (at times)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is great to play while watching tv. It does not take much concentration, but is still really fun.
