B000BW7QWW|5.0|Even though Serenity follows up the storyline from the series \\"Firefly\\" the movie can stand by itself.  The characters are well developed and interesting.  There is plenty of action.  The special effects are wonderful.  I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since the original \\"Star Wars\\".  Do yourself a favor and check out the series on DVD, too.  It does give you extra insite into both the characters and the storyline.
0060578793|4.0|This book is a great start to learning survival skills.  However, other books will be needed in conjunction if you are not a plant and tree expert.  I do highly recommend the book for anyone looking to learn to live off the land. It has great tips for survival kits and things you might not ever think of.  The author has obviously honed his skills over many years, and has the authority to give this advice.
B00005ATQF|5.0|\\"This is my rifle, there are many like it but this one is mine.\\"  This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  If you have Platoon and Apocolypse Now, you need to add this to your collection.

B000E33VWW|5.0|This was a gripping story and revealed so much about the real Capote and the men who committed the crime.  Need to watch more than once.  Great acting and Philip Seymore Hoffman worthy of the oscar!!
1577314808|3.0|I found the book to be overly repetitive.  The author mentions this, but it gets boring soon enough.<br /><br />Un-enlighten when he judges every-other with words such as \\"most people...\\"  How does he know about people that do not meditate as he does?  Totally made up!  The book contains some imprecision's on the historical references mentions and other factual happenings.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you are a SUPERNATURAL fan (LIKE ME!!!!!!!!!), this is the ultimate First season DVD!!! Love all the deleted scenes, gag reel and day in the life of Jared and Jensen! Can't wait for the Second Season DVD!! I will be counting down the sleeps!!!!

0060555661|5.0|This is a timeless book for both business and personal investors like me. <br />It lays the foundmental work that needs to be done to be an intelligent investor and basic elements that helps you to become an above-average investor. More you read, more you realize why some of us have lost so badly and some of us not suited as an investor because mental instability and lack of fundamental requirements of being an intelligent investor. <br /> <br />On the flip side, this book also gives us such confidence that it is not the IQ that counts, it is hard work and extra time that put into the analysis that helps one to become an intelligent investor....Patience pays out. This great book requires you to read it more than once for sure. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
0812550706|5.0|First off, to those who only felt this book was sub-par, you're obviously living in a fantasy world where everything meets your standards.  Every author is different and if they all wrote the same way, then we wouldn't be able to see their stories from their own unique perspective.    It's true that he goes from third-person view to first-person view in this book (and others), but this only serves to help us get into the mind of the character. It's because of this that you're able to feel so strongly about the character, to understand their motives.  Yes, it's different, and different is GOOD!    Orson Scott Card is a fantastic writer.  He knows exactly how to flesh out his characters so that you love them, you hate them, you know what their motives are, and in the case of Ender, you completely sympathize with him.  Ender is truly a tragic hero.  He wants so much to make the right decisions and follow his heart, but is conflicted on another level to ensure his own survival.  He ends up having to make some really difficult decisions that we all face in our individual lives.  Not all of them are perfect (he IS only a kid), but no one indeed can be.  His relationship with his sister is far from ideal.  Most of their lives have been spent apart from each other.  It's difficult to imagine someone expressing a genuine heart-felt love for another when they've spent most of their lives apart, and one has become embittered with the nightmares of war.  Again, you can't help but feel for Ender.  There are times you just want him to be real so you can give him a hug and let him know that life isn't all that bad.    What makes this book great for all people is that it isn't hard to understand and it doesn't use all that nonsensical, flowery descriptions that other books have.  There's no need to a be a literary or technical genius.  People of all ages can enjoy it as the great story that it is.  It's imaginative and completely original.  If you haven't read it, then you're missing out on a superb story.  It has influenced me in ways that no other book ever has.  READ THIS BOOK!
0778321606|5.0|This is a story of women from different ages and backgrounds coming together over knitting and yarn.  It's realistic.  Modeled somewhat after some of the quilting theme.  IT's a warm interesting story that keeps you turning the pages.  Characters are thos you want to hear more about (and I did in the follow-on volume).  Very good reading.
B000244FDW|5.0|A vert good adaptation to Jane Austen's book. It is better all that I have seen so far.
1856867889|4.0|This was bought for my 10 year old Grandson, to listen to a kids version of \\"mild high functioning autism\\" and how they related to life as a result.  It did this and more.  The whole family listened to it, then my Grandson, then my Granddaughter, his 8-year old sister will listen to it this week.  It was incredibily effective to help the 10-year old see himself, where is he, how he's progressed positively, and relate to the person in the story, and not feel so different from other kids. <br /> <br />I recommend this highly for anyone with a mildly autistic (high functioning diagnosis) child in the 8-14 year range, or family dealing with an Asberger's Symdrome child.  Mostly it makes the child feel better about themselves, and the story is told from a similar view by a similar child.  The adults might find it kind of off the beaten path, and wandering too far too long into some subjects.  But it can help bond with the kids too --one experience for all, and they can talk about it in a fun way.  6 hours of listening, 6 CDs as I recall.  Fiction.
0143038419|4.0|This is a great quick read for the frustrated armchair traveler which takes you through the amusing travel adventures of the author to Italy, India and Bali.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Good little head tweaker, but I really hope they stop here.  It keeps taking a little more out of the original, which was frickin awesome.  Well, nice set ups, and good camera work and editing.  Realistic gore, and very nice on the mood set up.  Stays pretty intense through out.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|This movie *defines* the whole screwball comedy. It was panned vehemently at the time, and no one really liked Kathrine Hepburn doing comedy, but it has aged extremely well. Now every critic clamors to shout their praise for it.<br /><br />Okay - so Cary Grant is just trying to play golf and impress his financier to give him a million dollars to save his museum, and this crazy broad (Kate Hepburn) completely ruins his game, all-but destroys his car, kidnaps him, gets him wrapped up in a wild goose - er... leopard chase, and finally wins his heart. You will be hard-pressed to find a better (or funnier) romantic comedy. This action (series of mishaps) never stops, often overlapping each other. This movie shows us why omen used to love Cary Grant and why everyone USED to love the movies in a fanatic religious worship kind of way.

0143038419|1.0|I picked up this book on the strength of good reviews and found myself wanting to throw it at the wall.  The author is a fine writer with a good sense of humor who seemed to want to write about her journey to self fullfilment, spiritual awakening and happiness. Instead she came off as a priviledged, slightly spoiled writer who needed an excuse for a writers advance so she could travel for free. She reveals herself to be a spiritual narcissist who obsessively navel gazes. While many passages are light hearted and funny and she is oh, so very clever and witty!! there was no real depth, no real meaningful questions asked or answered except for how she could get more breaks and be FULFILLED.  It seemed like an extended article for SELF magazine.   Instead order books by Kathleen Norris or even Anne LaMott for God's sake!
B000H5U832|5.0|We bought this movie for our son who was turning 3 and it is definitely his favorite movie! He doesn't sit still for much, so it says a lot that he wants to watch this over and over. We are very pleased with it, and have enjoyed watching it ourselves!
0790729342|5.0|If \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" set the standard for serial cliffhangers in the modern sense, then \\"The Road Warrior\\" sets the standard for post-apocalyptic storytelling...<br /><br />Set in a bleak future with no formal laws and a need for gas, bands of humanity scramble for everything we take for granted.  Even though $3+ bucks at the pump is wrong, having to literally fight and kill for it is something I hope we will never have to face ...<br /><br />\\"The Road Warrior\\" is a timeless story of rebellious nobility and the true goodness of humanity despite its struggle between greed and survival...

0060730552|5.0|Joe Simpson proves to be a gifted writer who brings us into the past with him (I'm so happy he was able to do so). This reader constantly had goosebumps on her flesh as Simpson unraveled the events of his climb. When he plummets off a ledge after being lowered by his climbing partner, Simpson realizes that his broken leg is just the beginning of his bad luck. Yates, Joe's partner, hangs on as long as he can, wondering why he hasn't felt a signal on the rope. Yates has no choice but to cut the rope, anything else would've cost two lives. I can hardly imagine Yate's horror when he learned that Simpson fell into a crevasse while still alive. Exhausted, frost bit and haggard, Yates barely stumbles into camp himself.<br /><br />All alone and thought dead, Simpson hangs onto the crevasse wall, refusing to quit on life, though life seems to have quit on him. What happens next isn't just a great story, it's inspiration for us all to never quit until we've taken that last breath! My heart does go out to Yates, who must have had deep emotional scars to heal from. Simpson calls Yates his hero, and rightly so. You won't want to miss reading this book and also watching the documentary. I'm not a climber, but I certainly appreciated the world Joe and Simon shared with me.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />Author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
B00000JSJC|4.0|Suspensful, good acting, interesting premise, a little too violent to rate it 5 stars
087349976X|2.0|I really liked the piece on the cover and assumed that all the pieces in the book would follow in the same vein and I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and the projects are kinda crappy. There are a couple of things worth making but they didn't make the purchase worth the cost of the book. The how to part of the book isn't very good either. Explanations assume that the reader knows how to do things and there are very few pictures showing processes. Luckily I know what I'm doing!
B000KC8O3S|4.0|This CD has a fabulous selection of tracks from both the first and second seasons of Dr Who. Included is the revamped theme and an extended version. The selection of music is great from fast paced to slow and moving. Overall, a very enjoyable CD. One worth adding to the collection, especially for all those Dr Who fans.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I'm going to write this review in portuguese: <br />Sin City é um dos melhores filmes baseados em quadrinhos que já vi. Na verdade, se eu não conhecesse os quadrinhos de Frank Miller, ainda gostaria do filme, mesmo assim. Esse box faz juz à qualidade do filme. Pena que não será lançado por aqui. <br />O único problema é que a graphic novel que acompanha a caixa está reduzida. De resto, imperdivel.
B000004286|5.0|Hello, I just purchased the the original Braveheart soundtrack through amazon a couple weeks ago after seeing the dvd for the mandatory every 6 month review just to see if I too, still have a heart (not to mention tear ducts). Every time I watch this movie it evokes the same emotions I remember sitting in the theater back in 1995 while hydrating my pop corn. Having purchased the soundtrack and, listening to it in it's entirety is like watching the movie through the \\"theater  of your (own) mind!!! James Horner has done a superb job in capturing the intensity of each and every scene and putting it to music for our souls to enjoy forever. I knew I had a wee bit O' Scott in my veins, but each time I listen to this classic it is like having a personal transfusion from the,\\"William Wallace Lineage,\\" reserve.<br />Long live William Wallace, James Horner and of course Amazon.com.<br />Thank You!<br />Casey Pons<br />Portland, Oregon
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This DVD set rules! The extras are awesome! Comes with an original Frank Miller comic book AND the bonus DVD is also cool. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially those with an interest in comic books. And, no need to say, the movie itself is one of a kind with its cinematography.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Both Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet were brilliant in this film! Jude Law and Jack Black were also fabulous. It is one of the BEST movies I have seen in a long time. A must-see film for sure!!!
B000068IEU|5.0|Like many horror films - the cover and title have nothing to do with the film.  Its not about a haunted house whatsoever.<br /><br />A nice creative mix of The Virgin Spring, Godard's Weekend and the short story Wiseblood.  It seems to have been an influence on Deliverance.<br /><br />Ive never been a Wes Craven fan and wondered how he made his rep - Im glad I saw this film.  Its very inventive and has a disturbing sadistic quality thats enhanced by its low budget realism.<br /><br />THe music was mysterious and both enhanced and detracted from the film.  interesting.  It reminded me of Charles Manson's syrupy sweet and bizarro country/folk/pop recordings from the 60s (in contrast to the Tate murders).<br /><br />this film is truly a horror classic.
1594200823|5.0|This book was  extremely interesting and well-written. It changed the way I will eat in the future.  I feel I am now much more knowledgeable about what food to buy and nutrition in general.
B0006IIKS0|2.0|This should be re-titled: Metallica: The making of St Anger staring Lars Ulrich. I felt this was more a making of, or the Lars Ulrich show, (who gives a s*** about you selling your Paintings for millions of dollars) then a documentary of the band falling apart, yes there were some interesting pieces, the interview with a near crying Mustaine, James talking about home life and how badly he treated his family (surprised his wife stuck around... must be his money) & Jason's views on the future of Metallica etc etc... but with a running time of over 2 hours and way too much rehearsal footage I would only recommended only to die hard fans. Or fans of St Anger... if any.
B000002UTY|5.0|A few have labeled this a dull or booring, I'd assume that they don't have a background in other aspects of improvizational music - jazz, ragas...    If you're used to the pop format (frequently associated with comercialized drivel from my perspective) - don't buy this unless you are wanting to expand your musical horizons.   <br /> <br />These were musicians playing music for the music, not for major $$$s.    <br /> <br />By the way, for those who like the dual lead format, Wishbone Ash was and still is dual lead - check out Argus for starters (from around the same era - esp the cuts \\"The King will Come\\" and \\"Warrior\\").  The re-issue CD has some bonus live tracks, with an extended version of Phoenix. <br /> <br />Also, back around that time, Fleetwood Mac was also dual lead - check out \\"Then Play On\\", esp the cuts \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" and the two cuts about \\"Madge\\". <br /> <br />Also, regarding Dino V, I heard QMS live at the Ampitheator twice in Chicago, once pre-Dino and once after - definately liked them better With John C.   <br /> <br />Hope this helps, <br /> <br />Scott
0977326403|5.0|I used the hardback Good to Great as a text for a class I taught.  Then used the monograph for a staff retreat discussion (we are a university department).  They both work well as a basis for discussion, analysis of your own organization, and personal challenge to explore organizational change.  You don't have to totally agree with everything presented, but it makes for excellent reading and discussion.  I used it for class in combination with \\"First Break All the Rules.\\"  Both are great discussion starters.
B0000AI45P|4.0|When you revisit your musical taste of twenty years back a lot of it doesn't sound that fresh any longer, this album, though, really does, everything from the neurotic sounding vocals to the dry drums and the odd guitar works. Getting the full length version of the underrated \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" helped me make up my mind upgrading my old vinyl.

B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I think Joshua Radin's We Were Here is a great album to buy.  It is one that I can put in and listen to from start to finish without having to skip any songs.  I would suggest it to anyone who likes Iron and Wine, Denison Witmer, Damien Rice, The Shins, Simon and Garfunkel, Teitur Lassen,  etc etc.  I look forward to purchasing more of his music in the future.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Not only is the animation gorgeous, but Miyazaki really uses his imagination.  It's enjoyable for adults and kids alike.  One of the best animated movies I have ever seen.
0763631205|5.0|I bought this book because I thought it would be fun to read to my kids at Christmas time.  My expectations were definitely met. <br /> <br />Not only is the story great- there is a lot in there that doesn't make it into the movies- but the illustrations and even the construction of the book are perfect for family reading. <br /> <br />The binding is very sturdy and should hold up to years of use.  It is a great value for the price and I would certainly recommend it.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is another great Beatles album.  It's unfortunate that some people have tried to make these songs into something weird.  But weird people do and say weird things.  If you are a fan of The Beatles, this famous album should definitely be part of your collection.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|What fun.  From the theme song to the hero, everything has been revamped - and it rocks!  I hadn't bothered to watch an 007 movie for years.  They had become so plastic, forgettable and trite.  All those boring gadgets and villains.  Plus a variety of unconvincing, way too suave 007s, who were nothing like Ian Fleming's hero.  Except for Timothy Dalton, none of them had the gritty edge I expect in a James Bond - and that we got with the first and greatest of them all, Sean Connery.  This guy has it.  I have to say I was a little doubtful because he's a blonde, and somehow blondes don't do it for me as tough guys.  But he is perfect in the part, and believably tough and violent - think human tank....  If he does another 007 movie, I won't wait till the DVD is available to see it.  And that's a high recommendation from me!  (hate crowded movie houses)
B00006L9ZT|5.0|For me, this is the best Ring cycle I am aware of - excellent singing, staging, acting, James Levine direction, etc. It is a traditional staging, which I far prefer, with top singing in each role. I am a great fan of James Morris as Wotan and was highly satisfied with all other major roles. If you enjoy a traditional Ring cycle, you can't go wrong with this production.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|[...].    From the one hit wonders like Fall Out Boy, Akon and falling stars like Britney Spears, all these people have going for them is either a place in the tabloids with upskirt shots or drug and alcohol binges, or new wave haircuts recycled from Duran Duran and Flock of Seagulls days and makeup like transvestites.  Let's see where all these one hit wonders are even 3 years from now.     RUSH have been making relevant music, making a difference to those who understand their words and music, and inspiring new musicians and old alike, for over 30 years.   Who else can say that?? Not the Stones, nor the Who nor anyone else.   They may not have sold as many albums as some teeny bopper bands but none have rocked harder. They are consummate musicians, dare I say virtuosos. Absolutely a wonder to watch these 3 guys make music that fill a hall, others would need over 6 men to do.    I have to admit I am a fan of the old RUSH with my favorite albums being All the Worlds a Stage, Caress of Steel, Hemispheres and even the synth sounds of Signals. Neil's lyrics helped me through some lonely and tough times in my teen years and I truly believe it is poetry he is writing.    After their last outing Vapor Trails, I was longing for another new album and I was not let down. Snakes and Arrows is an absolute wonder. I have listened to the words and the music over 10 times and it gets better and better, the way good music should.    RUSH is a band that parents should admire. While others claim to fame is to burn out with drugs, brawls and overdoses, RUSH is refreshing even 30 years on. You can call them the perfect role models for future musicians who need to respect their music and their fans. Not the degradation of women in rap music or the fluff love [...].of pop music, but the thoughtful, well constructed music of RUSH.    Snakes and Arrows is the best music they have made since Moving Pictures and I should know. I have been a fan since 1980 and have bought everything they produced. And I am open to all types of music from R & B to Hip Hop to Speed Metal and I can say no group deserves more adoration and admiration than RUSH. And no band deserves to be in the Hall of Fame more than them.  I look for to seeing then live this summer and you should to. There are not many bands better live than recorded. U2 is one RUSH is another.  Snakes and Arrows is a real treat.   Buy it guys, you won't be disappointed.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Love is quite an accomplishment... it's about as close to perfect so many different ways... <br /> <br />i would give it six stars if i could
B0000027G6|5.0|Many years ago, while I was going through some very difficult times, I listened to this CD EVERY NIGHT for a solid year. I never tired of it; quite the contrary, the more that I listened, the more I heard and felt. It became a meditative and steadfast element in my daily diet of recovery. My point is that the collective composition, arrangement and performance of each piece is without peer, in my estimation; and that covers all genres. I listen to everything that my two older brothers - both professional musicians - throw at me, and I consider this to be the \\"Sergeant Peppers\\" of contemporary orchestral music. Truly one for the ages. Buy it, and enjoy it for a lifetime.
1401308201|5.0|GREAT book, GREAT details and excellent overview of the play.  Good/Fun coffee table book - everytime I sit down I pick it up and find something new.
B00005JPFF|2.0|I thought this movie was easily the best of the trilogy.  All you pathetic comic book geeks who were disappointed in it ought to get a hobby instead of bitching endlessly on why Venom isn't \\"developed\\" enough or why there were too many villains in the same movie.  It's JUST A MOVIE, and a great one at that. <br /> <br />     The action is great, the special effects are amazing, and the overall pace of the movie made every minute of it very enjoyable.  Every cast memeber did a great job with their role, maybe with the exception of Topher Grace as Eddie Brock.  IF this film had any weaknesses, Topher Grace was it.   <br /> <br />     But if that's the worst problem of the film, then I'd say it's still the best film of the year.   <br /> <br />     Instead of complaining about why the film didn't satisfy their pathetic lives, all those comic book geeks should have stayed home (in their parent's basement) and acted out their version of an acceptable Spiderman flick with their mint-condition action figures!! <br /> <br />
0316010669|4.0|I read this for a book club and it's stimulating, fascinating and interesting! It is also a fast read with lots of examples to prove his point of snap judgements ~~ of why we make instant decisions the way we do. This is not a teaching tool by any means, but just a series of examples provided to show that there is more that meets the eye than what we see on the surface. From thin slicing to Listening with your eyes, this book skims over the first two seconds of first impressions. And that is fascinating!! <br /> <br />If you're interested in why things work out the way they do, this book is it. Remember the New Coke campaign? It goes into details here about first impressions and other group studies about the campaign that flopped. Gladwell even writes of Kenna, a semi-famous but very talented singer who just doesn't quite make it on the radio waves. There's the statue story of where just about everyone believed they had the real thing on their hands, but to find out it was a forgery long after they've spent millions of dollars on this \\"find.\\" Gladwell takes these stories and dissect them bit by bit and talks about the unconcious. He explains why some of these people have a nagging feeling that something isn't \\"quite right\\" and how they've stumbled onto the answers that eventually proved their points.  <br /> <br />This book also explains how economics and marketing come into play as well, why some campaigns fail and why others succeed. It even attempts to explain why some athletes are more successful than others. There's even a chapter on why people pick people to be their CEOs or even their president (Warren Harding is used as an example). It is just purely fascinating and interesting! Definitely worth a read! <br /> <br />It is a guaranteed conversation starter for any get-together! If you like nonfiction and psychology, you'll like this one! <br /> <br />5-14-07
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a classy boxset. The design is flawless and unique. The commentaries, behind the scenes and blopper reels are well made, informative and exactly what you want for a show of this standard. An amazing show! I would buy this a hundred times over! I couldn't be happier.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie was a great movie. I am a James Bond Fan. I went to the show to see the very first one. Daniel Craig did a terrific acting job. I hope another is in the works soon.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|The third in the set is a bit different, many of the songs are not written by Meatloaf. Because of this, there is a different feel to this one, I liked the first two much better.
B000KRNCYY|1.0|I really wanted this CD very badly because I love this music.  However, <br />when I received it, my husband and I were unable to play the CD in any <br />of our players.  We are very disappointed.  The CD was too thick for our <br />machines to take.  I had ordered this one and then another, but the same <br />thing happened with the second CD.  This is the first time this has ever <br />happened.  I ended up throwing away the CDs.
B000MQ54OO|2.0|Happy Feet is a wonderful animated feature film which will entertain any child from age 4 through 95! The story is heartwarming and the animation is breathtaking. The voice work by the cast is pretty good as well. I heartily recommend this movie, especially in its HD DVD form. The HD DVD picture is spectacular and reveals every fine detail of the penguins and their environment. A must-own for HD DVD fans!!
B000BT97AO|5.0|This movie is definately worth buying.  I purchased the movie because the Jim Henson company was invloved in it and before they did excellent films/shows such as Farscape and the Labrynth.  Although I had never seen MirrorMask before purchase, it proved to live up to the Jim Henson name.  It was very beautifully made and as usual the effects were to aid the story and not for the sake of popping your eyes out like most movies.  The story is very original and I doubt you will find another movie that is quite like this one.  This is a kind of movie you will watch twice and then want your friends to see.  Great movie, thumbs up.

B000RJO578|4.0|****This review may cointain possible spoilers****<br /><br />I have not seen \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and can't compare the two but I am sure that \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is screamingly funny. The contrast between the first hour of a gentle comedy and the second part with the outrageous twists and turns and bizarre jaw-dropping events is hilarious by itself. The idea of keeping the picturesque sleepy charming village of Sandford the safest and the most perfect place in the country no matter what even if not original was clever. Two main characters, Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, the finest cop London ever seen but could not take for too long and Nick Frost as Danny Butterman, Angel's partner in Sanford, the loyal Sancho Panza to Angel's Don Quixote, are great together because the film took its time to develop their relationship and to make them real and interesting enough to root for them. There are not just the references to and the parodies of the big budget American actions flicks. No, if you look closer, you'll find the homage even to a Woody Allen's film and to the works of John Waters -\\"Serial Dad\\", anyone? The acting is universally good and for me the movie that stars Jim Broadbent, Martin Campbell, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy and my favorite Mr. 007, Timothy Dalton is definitely worth watching. Oh, I almost forgot - there is a very compelling performance by a swan!<br /><br />IMO, the creators got a little carried away in the final part and made it a little too long but \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is still one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time and I don't remember the last time I was laughing in the theater so hard and so loud.
B000O178BY|4.0|I bought this disc a few weeks ago and have been enjoying it. If you are a NIN fan than you will probably like this album. Trent reminds us that the true spirit of rock-n-roll is not dead. It's not about a top 10 song. It's not about angst. Trent continues to lead the way. His quote about the record label (UMG) is classic: \\"I guess as a reward for being a \\"true fan\\" you get ripped off.\\"
B000NVIXFK|5.0|One of the most admirable things about Rush is that they have been creating their own inimitable style of music since the mid-70s and \\"2112\\". They have long since been a band that does not conform to pop culture and pressures of the album charts; instead, they march to their own beat, playing the type of music that they like to play.<br /><br />I gave this CD a top rating because that's what it deserves. The song composition reflects a metamorphosized Rush and a new approach, as the last 3-4 studio releases have. Overall, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a testament to the survival of Rush for 30+ years, as if to say \\"We're still here making music\\". It is well-written, well-produced, and demonstrates the constant finesse that each band member contributes to the whole.<br /><br />Upfront, don't expect any commercially-appealing tunes/Billboard-type songs on this album, except maybe \\"Far Cry\\". That's no longer what Rush is about and they don't ever have to be. Gone are the exhaustive 6-month periods to record albums, followed by incessant world tours. This release is more about music as art and it's obvious that Rush now takes their time creating it, for the sheer joy of the creative experience and for their fans.  The Canadian power-trio of Lee/Lifeson/Peart is not afraid to try new ideas and it is blissfully evident on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Snakes and Arrows\\" requires several listening sessions to get an idea of the \\"flavor\\" of it all. One thing is for certain and that's the fact that Rush has worked diligently at keeping this from being boring. Overall, there's a lot more acoustic work by Lifeson and some surprising new endeavors to include a blues-based acoustic power-strummer called \\"Hope\\" (performed solo by Lifeson), Zeppelin-esque tinged \\"Faithless\\", and a few excellent instrumental segments in \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\". In addition, there were several new instruments introduced into the mix, e.g. mandolin, mandola by Lifeson and Mellotron by Lee that reflect a refreshing new approach.<br /><br />It's apparent that this CD was well thought-out; I read Neil Peart's article about the making of it on his website, and it's clear that they are still strong, vibrant and creative musicians, as they will forever be. Personally, I think that 13 songs is VERY generous and many different styles of Rush are represented, always conveying the legendary virtuosity that they each possess.<br /><br />Some fans may look back in retrospect and wonder, \\"Why can't there be another \\"Tom Sawyer\\"?\\" or \\"Where's the next \\"Subdivisions\\" on this CD?\\" The answer to it all is that Rush has successfully evolved from its style on every single previous album and progressed forward; there can be no turning back in the realm of creativity. As a musician, I can definitely see and appreciate that from an insider's perspective that it becomes increasingly more difficult to create material that is \\"avant-garde\\", yet true to one's style and identity. The modus operandi in all of this is \\"basic elemental instinct to survive\\", to quote from one of Rush's songs....and they have done so, splendidly.<br /><br />If you are a Rush fan, you would definitely want to have this CD, simply to appreciate their latest artwork and transitory \\"leap\\" back into the \\"driver's seat\\". If you are a newcomer to the world of Rush or simply looking for well-produced (by none other than Nick \\"Booujze\\" Raskulinecz himself) virtuoso musicianship, here's also where to find it.hing new approach.

B000NA1OXY|3.0|I loved her first two CDs, I found this one to be average.  Same old same old.
0316172324|4.0|When I bought this book, I thought it would have exercizes to increase one's ability to think quickly. This book does not do that, but instead gives you a look into some of the amazing things your brain does in an instant. An interesting read if you want to learn a little about how we are able to make decisions in an instant.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I am always skeptical about a double CD being good but this was excellent!!
B000001GYC|5.0|Until I purchased this  bargain (two discs for the price of one),  recording of Mendelssohn's \\"Songs without Words\\" that are played exquisitely by Daniel Barenboim, I, in the past, have listened mainly to Mendelssohn's chamber music, Concertos and/or Symphonies kind of forgetting about these most beautiful compositions,  What a real pleasure this recording has been for me.  I believe that Mendelssohn composed these\\" Songs without Words\\" (also included are Mendelssohn's \\"Kinderstucke\\", op 72, \\"Albumblatt\\", op. 117 and 2 short pieces) through out his short life.  Daniel indeed plays all of the works including the \\"demanding\\" ones (there are surprisingly for me some very demanding ones) most beautifully never forgetting that the compositions are above all else \\"Songs\\".   Daniel Barenboim always lets the melodies be heard above all else and there are some very beautiful melodies to hear. <br /> <br /> This recording was made in the early 1970s; however, DGG has done a wonderful job of transferring them to the CD format--the sound is rich, lush and clear.   <br /> <br />If you want to hear some beautiful compositions that are played most beautifully, buy this recording.    <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|This is the most amazing piece of work any artist has ever put together and for Reznor to do it in less than 2 years amazes me. There are no bad songs, there are some better than others but the arrangement helps the album flow naturally. Every time I listen to it I hear a new sound or something I didn't hear before. This CD is timeless. It tells an awesome story in my mind. This is a revolutionary masterpiece!
1932100660|5.0|This is a prescription for a healthy, disease-free future based on what has to be the most profound \\"life-style\\" habit many--myself included--practice: what we eat every day. Perhaps I can't persuade you to read this book, but I sincerely wish you would. <br /> <br />This is not just a prescription for a healthy future life, it's a socio-political bomb. This book is more dangerous than Cindy Sheehan, than Michael Moore, than Hugo Chavez (or maybe Rush Limbaugh or Osama). This book is more like Silent Spring, or An Inconvenient Truth, or All the President's Men; not the opening salvo in a new barrage of revelatory information, but the one that sums it up, that grabs your attention, makes you wish to inquire further; that levels charges and backs them up with facts. <br /> <br />It calls into question the validity of most of modern medical research, and to my reading accuses the \\"health establishment\\" of lying for financial gain. If it were not for the authors' meticulous notes and peer-review-quality substantiation the whole premise of the book--that a whole-foods plant-based diet can lead to a more disease-free and active fulfilling life--would be susceptible to destruction. And what a shame that would be: more confusion, misrepresentation, more unnecessary death. However both the research (the China Study itself) and the subsequent chapters' examination of other researchers ring true. There is a huge industry dedicated, not to making me genuinely well following my heart attack or cancer, but to making money with pills and technology at unbelievable cost to the \\"patient\\" and to society, and at unbelievable profit to others. Profit: that's the name of the game, and if Campbell is right there are many whose voices are being ignored, even suppressed, that others may profit from our--the public's--confusion; not a new thing, you might say. [And who are you to be so naive in the face of the Bush Administration, the Church, the emerging face of massive electoral fraud andcorruption.] <br /> <br />After all, many in this society have made immense profit from gas-guzzling unsafe cars, from \\"wars\\" which are crimes against humanity, from drugs--legal and illegal--that kill, from lives of \\"public service\\" lining their pockets from the misfortunes of others. So why not kill us with food, kill us with health care? <br /> <br />This book says nothing new, but in an eloquent and clear way something old, fundamental and beautiful: reject the crap, look at your diet and health with some common sense, live simply and in harmony with the planet in this and in all things. Live longer. Live better.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Infamous post-thrash metal band Machine Head releases their sixth album, which is titled \\"The Blackening\\", and this is their most epic album to date. If you thought that \\"Through The Ashes of Empires\\" was a return to form, this surpasses it. We have eight tracks here, ranging from 3 minutes to 10 minutes. Tracks like \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" and \\"Slanderous\\" will remind you of how metal should be played. Even after 13 years since their debut, \\"Burn My Eyes\\", Machine Head has not let up. The guitar parts are amazing, Robb Flynn still remains an excellent vocalist, and Dave McClain's drumming is superb.<br /><br />Overall, this could be a landmark in today's modern metal scene. If you're getting tired of the usual, pop in \\"The Blackening\\", and sit back while you listen to this masterpiece of an album.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Best Bond Movie I've seen in awhile.  I hate \\"Formula Bond\\" movies.  This one stuck to the original book and is awesome.  Daniel Craig was hard to get used to, but it's gritty, action packed and worth buying.  Supplemental materials are OK.  A lot of info on disk two.  I enjoyed it.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is the ultimate family movie!  Excellent music, beautiful cinematography and easy story-line that children of all ages can follow.  We love it so much that we have the soundtrack now for the car-- and how fun for our young family to be able to sing along as we go about our own adventures!
B000FVQYYK|3.0|It had one song I heard on the radio that I liked. Be weary buying this though because you may not get it. It is very new aged sounding. I thought it was ok but maybe it is one that the more you listen to it the more you like it.
0800141660|5.0|The cinematography is beautiful, the soundtrack amazing, honesty of the characters and Austen's story is compelling.  This movie sucks me in every time-- and I confess to laughing AND weeping along with Elinor at Edwards's confession... every time.  This is  a keeper!
1400086035|5.0|Jim Dale is truly amazing. You would not believe that there is only one person reading the story. He really brings Dickens alive. I cried at the end.
6305907145|4.0|Most Janeites will disregard this film as not being true to the novel and claim the actors are too \\"pretty.\\"  I however, think this film is strong enough to stand on it's own without having to be completely true to the original.  The characters are strong, the acting honest and raw, and Fanny is very funny, in a very Jane Austenesque subtle, ironic way.  I am glad to own it.
B0007M22TI|5.0|One of the best music CD I have ever bought
B00006GA48|5.0|I have the original album, purchased when I was a teen, and the comparison is incredibly fresh and crisp, not to mention the addition of the extra live tracks.  This was on my Christmas wish list and I'm so thankful for the gift as every track is a treasure.  I highly recommend it.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|One of the best music CD I have ever bought
B000N3ST8O|5.0|First of all, the packaging for Crystal Visions (CD/DVD)is a real work of art. The songs are her best material & just to spice it up, there are some new cuts tossed in, like \\"Rock & Roll(Live)\\" and I LOVE the unique arrangement on \\"Dreams\\"(with Deep Dish).  The CD is excellent (16 tracks), but the DVD is OUTSTANDING! Best collection of Stevie Nicks videos I've ever seen & it's all on one disc! Even if a person owns no other material by Stevie, this collection is so good it stands alone on its merit & is definitely worth buying.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|One of the best music CD I have ever bought
B000H0MKOC|4.0|For all of its nicotine and addictive natures, I never once got into cigarettes. Sure I had a couple but they never once became an addiction. Ironically there are people out there whose sole job it is is to get people to smoke. Criticized for having no moral compass, they basically smooth talk their way into media's hearts by saying the wrong words the right way. As Aaron Eckhart's character says, if you argue correctly, you're never wrong. That is the basic for this film: nobody is really right or wrong, it's just a question of who sounds the most convincing. <br /> <br />Eckhart plays Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies whose basic job is to downplay the dangers of tobacco and smoking and turn things around in their favor. He doesn't necessarily lie, he just makes the truth sound so cool. But when politicians want to put a more grim warning label on cigarettes, Naylor is called into action but a reporter has that come crashing down and he has to once again, talk his way out of rough waters. <br /> <br />A film like this usually rests on one actor, unlike most where it's an ensemble film. Eckhart is one of those kind of actors that he's so good when he's actually given a good part to play although roles in Paycheck and the Core were at least watchable but here he kind of flexes his muscles. The rest of the cast is great as well with funny cameos from Adam Brody of the O.C, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot as the Marlboro Man. The only thing about some of the cast members is that they do feel like cameos with Naylor's ex dating a doctor that practically appears in 2 scenes and Katie Holmes as the reporter just feels miscast (someone like Rachel McAdams would've been perfect). <br /> <br />What's enjoyable about the film is that not only is it funny (one favorite is the senator who wants to eliminate all incidents of cigarettes from movies, complete with hilarious alternatives) but it never really feels like an anti-smoking ad in the guise of a film. It argues its pro-smoking points just as well as its anti-smoking ones and leaves it to the viewer to figure out who seems better to you. If its got any faults is that when we start to learn more about Nick the man and not Nick the silver-tongued man on a mission, it doesn't really have the energy when the film ramps up in satire. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if you'll end up buying this, but it's a great rental and up to you whether to completely go ahead and buy it. Which isn't a bad thing since it's so funny.

0143038419|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love, rearanged my vision, turned up my brain, and journeyed with me to a higher level of being. This is it! The most luscious, delicious, tear-jerking, laughter-evolking, reality-rising book I've read in years.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|The ladies are impresive!  Beautifully sung Celtic folk songs.  It is a definate DON'T MISS for those who love music of any kind!
B000B5UL7G|4.0|I am not that big of a fan of his but I really enjoy his music. His greatest hits are the best. Being in the states now you have to buy his CDs to hear his music. If I were still in Germany I might wait for the second greatest hits.
B00005JPAO|2.0|I certainly understand why this film won Academy Awards - very well-deserved!  Helen Mirren conveys more with her facial expressions than most people can with words and gestures.  It was a wonderful characterization of Queen Elizabeth II facing an unprecedented situation (Princess Diana's death) and how she coped with and handled her own emotions, the royal family, and the nation.  I've watched it several times and expect to uncover even more levels each time I see the film.
B00000JCB2|4.0|I neither hate or love LB, but I do think they have a talent for writing catchy songs. None of their songs will ever challenge a listener. Everything is very straightforward, mindless fun. I consider them a gimic band. Fred is average at best. Really, the thing that carries this band is Wes Borland's guitar-work. He has a very original sound and comes up with some great guitar riffs.  Too bad he is wasting his talent in this band. I'm sure he is happy about all the money they have made, but for an artist like him, it would have to be very stifling, because this album is one big, made-for-radio albatross. It is so obvious what they were trying to do here. They basically sold out. I enjoy this album for the unique, fun-filled event that it is, but it is so one-dimensional that I rarely come back to it anymore. It comes across as a piece of label-created, nu-metal fluff. But, what the heck, I had a lot of good times listening to it at parties back in the day. And that is what it is good for. Mindless fun. Props to Borland for his new band, Black Light Burns. It comes out June 5th, and I am impressed already.
0060245867|5.0|I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson and was immediately his favorite book to read at bedtime. My daughter is now having to read it to him 2-3 times before it is lights out.  In fact, even yesterday during the day, he wanted it read to him.  It is a great book.
B000001Y42|3.0|This is LB's heaviest album, and many people who like their work from Significant Other onwards may only like a couple of songs on here, because they tend to be more raw-sounding and in-your-face. Of course, everyone bought this because of \\"Faith\\", more than likely. I think the first half of this album was good and I like this heavy side of LB, but then they figured out how to sell records and in turn, sold out. LB was considered cool when I was finishing high school and entering college, but now they are kind of looked on with contempt. I think they had their place in music history, albeit not a big one, and they aren't meant to be taken too seriously. They were fun, but their career has run it's course. They peaked in 1999-2000, and it has been a long fall ever since. Still, on occasion, I bring out the old LB albums for some mindless fun at parties. And that's about it.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I enjoyed so much of this CD that I purchased one more for my mother-in-law, who is about 75 year old.  She just loves it.  I ended up buying more IL DIVO music for her -- But to me this is the best one.
B00004XOWM|3.0|There are many people who hate them, and many who love them. I kind of stand in the middle. At times, I think they have shown their potential, like with their first two albums. But lately, they have become more idiotic.  Definitely a gimic band. This album was fun to listen to when you were drunk at a college party, or when you needed something mindless to sing along to on a long drive. I tend to be embarrassed that I own their albums when talking to other fans of the heavy music scene. I think that I have learned to stay away from any new bands that show similar qualities to LB, but God help me, when I was first getting into heavier music, LB was there to bridge the gap. All my friends were into it. My musical taste has become heavier over the years, but LB is still a guilty pleasure at times. I think they have a talent for writing good hooks, but Fred is not a good vocalist. Wes Borland is very talented, and I'm glad he was smart enough to branch out from LB and do his own thing, because it must have been suffocating to be in such a scripted band.  Oh well. I take this album for what it is. Mindless fun with little lasting value.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Personally, I have never been a fan of the Dio-led Black Sabbath.  I'm sorry, but I've always considered Sabbath without Ozzy to not be Sabbath at all, and considering I've never been much of a Dio fan either (solo or Rainbow) that didn't really help any.  However, once upon a time, I gave Dio and Sabbath a chance, and ended up converting.  \\"The Dio Years\\" compiles some of the best material to come from Dio's time with Sabbath after Ozzy's departure, including favorites and no brainers like \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Heaven & Hell\\", \\"Die Young\\", \\"The Mob Rules\\", and a live rendition of \\"Children of the Sea\\".  There are also three new tracks that are worth the price of admission alone: \\"The Devil Cried\\", \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", and \\"Ear in the Wall\\".  This is one of those oh so rare cases when a compilation album is released with some new material, and the new material is actually pretty good.  While one could argue that a few other tracks would have been more than welcome here (like \\"Time Machine\\"), \\"The Dio Years\\" is a pleasently surprising, well assembled compilation disc that fans of Dio or Sabbath, new and old alike, should definitely check out.
1416914285|5.0|City of Bones, by Cassandra Clare, is the first in a purposed trilogy for young adults.<br /><br />When Clary and her friend attend a teen dance, Clary sees something frightening. A group of teens kill a young man. But the body immediately disappears. And Clary finds herself discovering a whole new world that she never knew existed.<br /><br />The Shadowhunters, as the trio calls themselves, slay demons. And normal humans aren't supposed to be able to see what they do. But Clary isn't a normal human. And when her mother is abducted, Clary finds herself involved in a Shadowhunter war, with time running out for her and her mother.<br /><br />This book was an incredibly enjoyable surprise. In this world, \\"all the stories are true.\\" Meaning, the stories about werewolves, vampires, and other things that go bump in the night are all real. With smart-aleck, teenage characters, scary adults, and even scarier bad guys; you never know when the next twist in the story will be revealed. Though some of the revelations are predictable, the larger, more important mysteries are exciting and well-worth the build-up. With intense action scenes, big mysteries, amusing characters, and a little teenage angst; this book should be a lot of fun for teens and adults alike. Fans of Harry Potter or vampire slayer books will probably enjoy this one.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|If you want to see a movie that is not afraid to present itself in a compelling, unapolagetic, and incredibly beautiful way, with the greatest cast you've never seen, along with remarkably strong and original music, then see this one, it's a classic in every sense.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Did I expect this Rush disc to sound like any previous Rush release?   No.   Did I expect that this would be a warm and fuzzy CD?   No.   Did I expect this to be the best Rush CD ever?   No.    Here is what I expected when I purchased this CD.   1. A beautifully written and delivered tapestry of poetic lyrics.    2. Extremely skilled and passionately delivered musicianship.   3. A CD that I would enjoy playing over and over again.  4. Songs that I would play several times in the first listen.     Did Rush deliver on my expectations? Absolutely!    (I repeated Hope 6 times before I would let it move on to Faithless)    I can only guess that the detractors purchased this CD with a pre-conceived expectation of it being another Bastille Day or Moving Pictures, and when they didn't get that they jumped on here and wrote a negative report.     Come on guys, these are with out question three of the most talented individual musicians on the planet right now. They are each MASTERS of their chosen instruments, and they don't have such huge ego's that they had to split up and \\"go solo\\". It is insufferably rare to find 3 artist of this caliber in one band, so frankly I am thrilled that they have graced us with one more distillation of RUSH in this CD.     Typed while on a drive from Houston to Austin and listing to Snakes and Arrows for the 8th time.   My son and I already have our concert tickets. We can't wait!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|The DVD was delivered sooner than expected.  It was brand new and in perfect condition.  Just as advertised.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|This is an intelligent spy movie.  It is reminiscent of Smiley's People or Tinker Tailor Spy. <br />I would recommend it to people who like this genre.  Alec Baldwin puts in a great performance.  All the other characters are well done also.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|\\"Leon (The Professional)\\" is an extremely violent film, which may discourage some viewers from discovering the extraordinary debut performance of eleven-year-old Natalie Portman.  While one would expect excellence from Jean Reno (as the immigrant killer-for-hire Leon) and the demonic Gary Oldman as a corrupt and drug-addicted police officer, the real surpise is Portman's natural and effective portrayal of a child seeking revenge for the callous murder of her little brother.  Leon accepts responsibility for her care, and the two develop an uneasy bond that is actually the main focus of the film.  Several scenes are outstanding, such as Portman's tearful but underplayed plea to be admitted to Leon's apartment after seeing her father's lifeless body lying in a hallway.  (The DVD contains an interview with the adult Portman, and refers to this scene.)  Equally moving is Portman's developing crush on the much older Leon, and Reno's reserved and somewhat confused reaction to her advances ranks high among his, or any actor's, work on screen.  The extended mayhem at the climax of the film is overdone, but nevertheless gripping, and provides a logical and touching resolution to this unusual but very plausible adult-child relationship.  (Be sure to watch the Portman interview, in which she explains her parents' reluctance to allow her to accept the role, given the level of violence, her handling of weapons, and that she appears to be smoking.)  This film was released internationally under the title \\"Leon\\" and in North America as \\"The Professional.\\"  The latter is a shorter version that omits several important scenes.  Choose the extended version, which develops the relationship between the two main characters much more effectively.  Fans of Natalie Portman should also check out the film [[ASIN:6305327084 Beautiful Girls]] in which she has a minor but extremely well acted role as a young and lovesick teenager.  This film predicts her excellent later work in [[ASIN:B00004WI5F Where the Heart Is]] and  [[ASIN:B000067J20 Anywhere But Here]].
B000002UAR|5.0|This was my first Beatles album, which I received on vinyl as a Christmas present the year it was released.  I'm very pleased to have a copy on c.d. to listen to now, and enjoy picking out the \\"bits\\" that were used on the newer \\"Love\\" album that I've bought recently, also.  Some Beatles songs have gotten old and hoary to me, but Revolver still \\"does it\\"!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|If you like the first 2 albums, this one is just as good
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Much better than the previous blue and silver edition.  It has additional features, not to mention an adjustable LED contrast display.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Excellent movie!  I think everyone in the entire world should watch.  Gives you an insight of what hard work is all about.
0374105235|5.0|Well-written.  Provides insight into a world that we read about in passing but do not become involved with.  This book involves the reader and makes you care.  The story is so well-told, that it becomes a very short read.
B000EGCITQ|5.0|When Pink changed her music style from her first CD I was upset b/c I really liked her first CD. But as I've seen her grow as an artist and as I've matured, I have really come to appreciate her talent. This CD really shows her range as far as singing and lyrics. Many of the songs on this CD are very deep and moving if you listen to the lyrics, but they also have a musical quality to offer. My favorite tracks are Who Knew, Long Way to Happy, I'm not Dead, and Dear Mr. President.
B00005JPO8|5.0|The constant thought that may go through one's mind while watching THE LIVES OF OTHERS is the fear of losing the freedom to read or write regardless of what it is.  Indeed, the film resonates \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"1984\\".  The film takes place during the height of the \\"Second\\" Cold War in East Germany, five years before the tearing down of the Berlin Wall.  Writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck portrays the mid to late 1980s as a chilling and fearful period filled with coldness and emptiness, which is clearly displayed within the limited confines of the Eastern bloc.<br /><br />The premise of the film involves the conflict of freedom of expression, which is twofold.  First, the protagonists are those who create arts, and second, the antagonists are those who censorship it.  The character, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muche), a Stasi or \\"thought police\\",turns out to be the surprising part of the film, and his colleague and boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), also a Stasi and an Orwell-like \\"Big Brother\\" is convincing to being the disliked character in the movie.  Hence, the turn of events, which occur during the concluding scenes make the film the most unpredictable and worth watching.  And with most foreign films, the technique of sound and silence - the expressions on the actors' faces, playwright Georg Deyman (Sebastian Koch) and actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), are highly effective in conveying a drench of irony, worry, despair, and desire for solace behind the Iron Curtain.<br /><br />THE LIVES OF OTHERS has a tinge of being a sanguine film.  But what it does provide is food for thought.  Undoubtedly, after watching the film, it makes one think of the things that are taken for granted, and which may easily be taken away.  What would the world be like if we did not have access to the arts and literature?
B000683VI4|5.0|It is an excellent movie.  I am glad i was able to get it from you all.  It was fairly priced and the shipping time was pretty good too.  Thank you so much.
0394800184|5.0|I am just thrilled to see that this classic is still going strong.  I remember this from the early 70s as I was a young girl and my father read this to me daily.  And now, I had the priviledge of introducing the book to my daughter about a year ago.  It became an instant favorite since it involves all the favorite characters of a toddler's life: conversations with a dog, cow, chicken, cat etc.  Parents that enjoy getting creative when reading to their children will love this book!
159562015X|5.0|My husband and I recently took the Strengths Finder test online and found it to be very enlightening.  It is so nice to know our top five strengths in a world where the negative is so often identified/emphasized.  Our daughter recommended this book to us and we can't wait to share it with our other adult children and their spouses so we can continue to learn about each others' strengths.  J. Vernon, Tooele, UT
B000K15VSA|5.0|How many DVDs have you seen that offer the ability to hear a commentary while watching the movie? Would it have been that hard to add Harrison Ford's voiceover (as an option) to the original DVD release for those of us who prefer the film noir quality it added to the movie? I wore out my VHS tape of this film and was so excited when it was finally released on DVD only to be disappointed by the removal of the voiceover and the change in ending.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|melodic, beautiful, lovely.  begins haunting, gets upbeat, then downtempo very similar to prev album
B000MXPE7O|3.0|This is a potentially fascinating story that is badly mishandled by Mr. Deniro. <br />Tedious pacing, clumsily presented symbolism and some poor casting decisions (Angelina Jolie, for one) make for a a dull and frustrating film. The relentlessly dark visual atmosphere of the film serves only to exacerbate the deadened quality of the script and direction.  <br />Its only saving grace is the actual story that it is trying to tell. It is a shame that a more talented director hadn't made the film.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Like no other Bond movie before- and not to take away anything from those, great as they were, that's not a bad thing. They did a really good job of taking the classic character and presenting him in a new light.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|Truly one of the best prog rock albums and certainly one of the best prog rock bands of all time. Bruford, Fripp and Wetton set a level that current bands are still trying to attain. Sounds fresh after all of these years. This band has influenced more musicians than most people realize.
0385333846|5.0|I've had a copy of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five on my shelf for a few years now.  It was never a required reading book in high school where I'm from, read 1984 by Orwell instead, and I'm glad I've read it now when I'm older albeit none the wiser.  I finally picked it up when I heard of Vonnegut's death, so it goes.    While telling the story of Billy Pilgrim, the predecessor of Forrest Gump, and the fire bombing of Dresden during World War II, the author throws in the fourth dimension of time and delivers the narrative alternating between the past, present and future much like a Quentin Taratino movie does now.    Vonnegut's comic relief use of the phrase \\"so it goes,\\" appears after each anecdote on death, dying or morality and occurs 106 times in the text.  Other phrases that were used frequently to tie the story together were the \\"smell of mustard gas and roses,\\" \\"blue and ivory,\\" hands and feet, and \\"radium dial.\\"  Also the Serenity Prayer was mentioned twice in key parts of the text so that even if you have a difficult time with Vonnegut bouncing back from future, to past, to present, you can still see how the story is pulled together with the help of his literary devices.    It's a hard book to categorize, because it deals with so many genres: satire, anti-war, and sci-fi to name a few and like any great piece of literature deals with universal themes like fate, free will, the illogical nature of humans and how life is only enjoyable with the unknown. I loved every minute of reading this novel and was sad to put it down after finishing it, but I will definitely read it again and his other works too.
B000065BPB|5.0|All I can say about this product is that it is an EXCELLENT buy. I have owned several Hi - Def cans and of all of them I must say that these Sennheisers produce the most realistic sound that an audiophile craves. Each and every detail in the audio is reproduced flawlessly. Good for watching movies and simply excellent for music of all kinds. Definitely recommended.
0380730367|5.0|Just by happenstance I bought and read A Drink Before the War the first in this series and am I glad I did.  If anything this is even better than the first.  This book actually lives up to the usual hype used in cover blubs.  The dialogue really does sparkle and I was happy to read that the two main characters, Kenzie and Gennaro got back together again.  This is something since ahhh, they aren't real people.  Their go-to sidekick Bubba remains just right, a guy that verges on a superhero and is always there for them.  One minor complaint.  The evil genius they battle is former Special Forces and, of course, was involved in a war crime in Panama.  The author makes it appear that US Army usually just equals massacre by golly. Lehane is just so good I'll give him a bye just this once.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|This movie is an awesome addition to any video game/anime fanatic's collection.  I bought the original movie when it came out in Japan, and also have the US domestic version (for the sake of having all versions), and recently purchased this item a few weeks ago due to it having \\"Last Order\\" and novel. My only complaint is that the postcards included are not the best pictures, and I would have preferred more of the main team, rather than Kadaj's gang.  However, for the sale price I purchased it for, I will not sulk about it for too long.  I support anything FF7 and would encourage others to do so.  This could mean more prequels, sequels, side stories!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Space, the final frontier...you know the rest.  This set of DVDs contains all the original Star Trek episodes.  The image transfer is excellent and the sound track is in 5.1.  The episodes are presented in  the order they were broadcast.  This is a must for any Star Trek fan.  What more can be said?
630169399X|5.0|I highly reccomend this film and I was so happy to see that it was released on VHS and made available here.  This film, recorded in the early 1980s, follows conductor (and composer) Leonard Bernstein as he records a new version of his brilliant WEST SIDE STORY (originally brought the Broadway in the 1950s, and later to the big screen in the Academy Award winning 1961 film) with Spanish tenor Jose Carreras (as Tony), Kiri Te Kanewa (as Maria), Tatyana Troyanos (as Anita) and others.  I remember this well.  I especially remember the constant bickering between Jose Carreras and Leonard Bernstein over--shall we say--artistic differences.<br /><br />Ultimately, the end product that comes of this labor of blood, sweat and tears is very successful.  It was a bit of a stretch, for me, to believe that Jose Carreras was Tony, a Polish boy, with his pronounced Spanish accent, but he was beautifully expressive.  That's called acting and being a believable and versatile opera singer, right?  Also, Te Kanewa (from New Zealand), was a bit over-the-top with her pronounced Puerto Rican accent, but I believe she was really just trying to get into character.  This was a fascinating account of a musical master at work with other musical masters. Great!  Purchase this before it goes out of print.
B000O178BY|5.0|After his slightly dissapointing \\"With Teeth\\", Trent Reznor went back to doing what he knows to do best: great industrial music with an edge that only he knows how to pull off. The entire album is a masterpiece, with tracks like \\"The Good Soldier\\" (4) and \\"Me, I'm Not\\" (6) standing out particularly.<br /><br />NIN hasn't sounded this good since [[ASIN:B00001P4TH The Fragile]]. Accompanied with one of the most interesting promotional efforts I've seen in a while, \\"Year Zero\\" easily made it to the top of my list of Best albums in 2007.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just finished watching it for a fifth time in four month. This series has amazing variety, actors' play, story, underlying messages, history connections. You will enjoy it for many years to come and always find something new and exciting... Best sci-fi - I've seen so far.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|`After the Wedding,' Denmark's \\"Best Foreign Picture\\" nominee for the Academy Awards has a lot going for it.  Even if there is a soap opera feel to the scenes and the story, the quality is head and shoulders above any serial.  Not to mention the fact we get six months of development in one movie.  Solid performances, and camera shots that capture every revealing reaction give the story a magnetic interest.    The film begins in India where Jacob Pedersen (Mads Mikkelson) works with the impoverished.  He feels at home with the children, but he goes back to Denmark to raise funds for the orphanage and get reacquainted with his family.  At home his former love Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) has married a tycoon, Jorgen Hanson (Rolf Lassgard), someone Jacob is able to solicit funding with ease.  Once they meet, he is invited to their daughter's wedding.  Much like `Rumor Has It' with far less laughs, yet more substantive development, Jacob finds out at the reception that he has more at stake at home than he previously thought.  From there he is reattached to deceptive Helene, and both must sort out the bitter resentment they feel for one another.  (Did he have one affair as he says or was he the philanderer by her account?)  Toasting her mother and step-father at the wedding, the bride Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen) later comes to grip with life-changing information in her own life.      Skillfully sorting out the relationships and priorities of the key players, `After the Wedding,' presents a bitter-sweet story with memorable characters and interesting circumstances.  One of the merits of the film is how it defines poverty in India and compares it with a different kind of impoverishment for the wealthy.  Jorgan's problems wouldn`t make us trade places with him for the world.  Similarly, one of the boys at the orphanage reminds Jacob that he doesn't even like the wealthy.  Another ironically says, \\"If I were rich, I'd be happy.\\"  Watching everyone come to grips with their lives and barter for stability make `After the Wedding` a revealing family portrait.

B000M06K5C|4.0|I liked so much this CD. I had the Silent Alarm title of Bloc Party, and under my point of view it's better. \\"Weekend in the city\\" follows the same way but it's a bit more difficult to listen to. <br /> <br />But if you liked \\"Silent Alarm\\" I think you would like \\"Weekend in the City\\" as well ...
0618680004|5.0|The book is highly provocative and intelligently written. This book should be read by believers (Christians, Muslims/Moslems, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, etc), nonbelievers (atheists), and people that are not sure (what I like to call confused people--agnostics). Dr. Dawkins is not only a fine scientist, but also a great writer (The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor's Tale, etc) and in this book he takes the reader on a journey that truly shows how ridiculous and delusional religion is. We atheists need to be more outspoken like Dr. Dawkins and Sam Harris (The End of Faith and  Letter to a Christian Nation) are or we will continue to be the pariahs of society as we are now (especially in the US).  Religion with its irrational beliefs and myths must be vanquished and rationalism with its truths based on evidence promoted if we are to have any hope of living in  peace with each other. Religion is now trying to bring back Creationism in public schools in a repackaged form called \\"Intelligent Design.\\" It is time to take a stand against religiosity and its irrational dogmas. We need militant atheism....we need to be militant atheists.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I've got this movie on DVD, UMD, and now Blu-ray.  I'll leave IMDB to tell you about the movie.<br /><br />I don't have an HD TV (don't ask), so I can't really comment on the picture quality.  I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really comment on the sound quality (although on DD5.1 it sounds just fine).<br /><br />Go ahead and pick it up!!

B000NQR7KM|5.0|This album marked a change in the band, as Phil Collins took over vocals after Peter Gabriel left the band.  Perhaps to prove to the critics that \\"Peter\\" was not the band, the group created one of their most inspired albums and one of my personal favorites.  The first time I heard \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" I thought perhaps Peter had remained in the band afterall as the vocal style was very similar.  As the album proceeded you could hear Phil's way of singing was similar but yet different.  The band is very tight on this album and with the remastering and 5.1 sound it is simply wonderful.
B000003S5H|2.0|This CD was a little less than I was expecting from it.  Only liked about 3 tracks on it, and only one of those blew my socks off.  I probably would not buy it again if I could go back.
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|Coldplay is absolutley amazing and puts on a great show.  The DVD is great to listen to you favorite songs played by the band live.  After going to their recent X&Y Tour concert I was blown away by the visuals (lighting and video) so I was a little disapoint to see this one which didnt have all the bells and wissles.  So I cant wait till the have an X&Y tour DVD. <br /> <br />
B00005JPCF|3.0|some 15 minutes before the end of the movie, i sent a message to my ex bf (who got the film for my son) a text msg saying \\"happy feet sux\\".<br /><br />he was supprised, and replied with \\"but it gor the oscar!\\"<br /><br />this is for the overall impression:<br /><br />going to the details, i agree with both spotlight reviews - apart from the amazing animation (in detail and mechanics of movement of both the animals and humans) this film is burdened with problems - from direction (pace), message, character development (even some of the main characters were pretty indistinguishable from one another), to the question of the main message of the movie (what sort of ending is that and what does it mean?!) and overall \\"heavy feeling\\" this film leaves you with.<br /><br />my son likes it cuz there is a lot of dancing (he dances to it) and some adventurous and funny scenes (he laughs a lot to it), so i guess i will keep it.<br /><br />nonetheless, compared to the cars and some other films, this is a sadly messed up piece of fine animation.

B000NA297O|3.0|I bought these when they were on sale for $69. I couldn't believe I could get all 5 seasons for $13 each. I just opened the box and realized why they were so cheap.<br /><br />The plastic casing for Season 1 was all but obliterated.<br /><br />Season 2 had chunks missing and cracks everywhere else.<br /><br />Season 3 has a few small pieces missing and a few cracks.<br /><br />Season 4 has a severe gash in the cover and a cracked case under Disc 2.<br /><br />Season 5 managed to escape w/out major damage.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't score this lower is the discs are somehow still pristine despite the damaged packaging. It wasn't shipping issues because the box they came in was not damaged so they were wrapped up & put in the box damaged. This the first and hopefully last problem I've had with Amazon.<br /><br />Discs are a '5' the rest '1'
1400063515|2.0|I recently watched an interview with the writer on a TV show I respect, so I decided to read this book. I expected arguments about why and how we, humans are limited in our ability to really know the world around us and hense cannot predict events until they hapen. Seems this book is more of a venting of the author's frustration of the impredictability in the business world. I don't have any interest in business, so I don't know if the book's conclusions are applicable to it. Being closer to the world of phylosophy and science I can say his arguments are out of place. The world around us is not random as the writer would have us believe. It only looks random if we don't know enough about it. Scientists were able to \\"predict\\" the existance of planets, elements, bacteria based on their effects on their surrounding environment even when they could not observe these objects directly. They could not scientifically \\"predict\\" the black swan because there was no data of its existance direct or indirect. In chemistry, biology, medicine and psychology we can \\"predict\\" what will happen because we have good understaning of the underlying processes. Many times we understand the cause-effect mechanism only after the event. In retrospect neither 9/11 nor the success of Google were \\"impredicatble\\", they just looked very unlikely. Maybe we just don't know enough about economy to predict the market.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is what I would call it \\"the perfect picture of all times\\" for anyone how loves movies, this one is definitely a masterpiece. Tornatore's best achievement. This is a movie about a movie-lover, a story of Toto who fall in love with the magical world of movies, a world that he was introduced to by his friend Alfredo, it is also a about cinema and how it is dying due to the change of time and the aggressiveness of TV. This is a love letter to movies and what it represents in our life... a masterpiece by all means; if you love movies then you must see this one either in the Director's cut or in its original version.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Older acts have trouble pleasing their fans, who rail simultaneously for new stuff and the classics. Ronnie and the boys do a fair job with this one, although it would be nice if Amazon would distinguish new tracks from classics in track listings. It's always a bit of a letdown to hear slow grinding from a band you know can speed things up if they want, but let's face it, Ronnie's around 65. \\"The Devil Cries\\" is a good steering-wheel pounder, if you know what I mean. There's enough channeled anger overall on the album to have it flow together. Makes me wish Ronnie would speak out against the mess in Iraq.
B000JIHP88|3.0|Our twins have two different mobiles to keep things interesting. While they enjoy watching this one move, they soon lose interest. I think it's because you can barely hear the music. Another problem is that the remote clicking is so loud that it defeats the purpose. What I do like are the cute and colorful animals and the nice movements. It's pretty good product, but I wouldn't buy it again unless they turn up the volume quite a bit. Overall - attractive, but disappointing.

B000GUJF4G|4.0|Everyone knows the story of the POSEIDON.  This is only the third movie to bear the name and be based (loosely) on Paul Gallico's novel, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  There was also a sequel to the original diaster film made by Irwin Allen that starred Ernest Borgnine and Shelly Winters and a ton of others that went on to be major stars.<br /><br />This version offers Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, and Andre Braugher.  Unfortunately, it only features the actors and actresses in roles that you can understand at a glance.  There are no real characters here, no sense of history.<br /><br />What you do get is a knuckle-buster of an adrenaline-soaked movie.  After POSEIDON was overturned by the rogue wave about eighteen minutes into the film, I didn't draw a breath till the final frames rolled through.  Was the plot predictable?  Sure.  Could I figure out who was going to live and who was going to die?  I was right more times than I was wrong.<br /><br />POSEIDON was shot on 53 sound stages, some of them several stories tall.  The special effects were amazing and the digital work is unsurpassed.  The ship felt real even though it wasn't.<br /><br />In this HD-DVD version, the video portions are beautiful and really show off the cinematography and sets.  But the audio is where POSEIDON soars.  Captured in Dolby TrueHD, one of the best lossless codec on the market today.  A surround sound system totally enhances the viewing experience, and this is one of the movies you can show off your system on.<br /><br />The viewing can be gut-wrenching and the intensity is definitely pumped up, so young viewers probably aren't a good idea.  But for someone who's looking for a high-end action movie that doesn't slow down during a 90-minute presentation, POSEIDON is great entertainment.

B00005MAM2|5.0|I'm relatively young in the grand scope of things, but after growing up on all things animated and illustrated, I'm still blown away by Akira's graphics. The attention to detail and painfully meticulous artwork on this film holds a special place in the realm of anime and in my heart, especially in the context of when it was created. I was handed this DVD as a passing \\"la-dee-da you should watch this it's really good and trippy zomg\\" and didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised and very very very confused by the story. I had to watch it more than once to completely understand what was going on exactly, but after the second time it dawned on me that this was truly something special. Not only are the visuals stunning, but the story is complex and wonderfully laden with philosophical nuance. The movie covers about the first volume of the Akira manga. (Which is why it is so confusing in the first place; it only covers a fraction of the story!) I strongly advise reading the comic books at some point before (or after) viewing the film as it will prove to be a good read and a crucial supplment to Otomo's story.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|Being a huge Bond fan, I highly anticipated watching Casino Royale and I'm sad to say, I was completely disappointed.  The storyline was very fractured, Daniel Craig was not believeable as Bond and at the end of the movie I found myself sayin \\"huh?\\"  I understand Casion Royale is the first Bond book and this movie introduces Bond to the world and Bond is learning his way, still I don't think the story was told very well.  While there are a couple of exciting chase scenes, I think the time spent on the chase scenes may have taken away from Bond's character development.  Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, the story felt half-told. <br /> <br />Eventhough I am disappointed with Casino Royale, if you are a Bond fan, it is a \\"must-have\\" for your collection.  Maybe it will be one of those movies that grows on me after I have seen it a couple of times, I hope so.

B00003CX5P|4.0|This is one great way to kick off Anakin Skywalker's path into the Dark Side.  It certainly explains that he didn't have it easy growing up.  He had to struggle with being a slave and leaving behind his mom who, up to that point, was the one human being he cared about the most.  My only complaint about this movie, is the sequence in which young Anakin is aboard the naboo fighter and saves the day (the whole sequence is too childish for my taste).  But having young Obi Wan and the introduction to Qui-Gon Jinn is worth getting this DVD alone.

B00004T9VY|3.0|When compared to the original vinyl version, this CD is disappointing. I have come to realize that the claim \\"re-mastered\\" is not an indication of quality.  I own several original master recordings of several artists that are truly spectacular.  But, the quality standard is specific to the organization that produced the work. Apparently, re-mastered and original masters are not the same.  Live and learn.

B00005JPD0|5.0|After I saw MAN ON FIRE in 2004, I was sure I'd never want to watch another Tony Scott film again because I'd had it up to here with his quick edit, camera-jumping style of film making.  I'm happy to say he abandoned most of that for DEJA VU, and the result is a high-concept, intelligent action thriller that takes us through time and space (in an entertainly complicated matter, much in the way that BACK TO THE FUTURE - PART II did) in an attempt to prevent a terrorist explosion from happening aboard a boat in New Orleans.
B00008BXJG|4.0|The last of the '70's Bon Scott albums, \\"Highway to Hell\\" is arguably the best AC/DC CD, save for \\"Back in Black\\". What Bon had that his successor does not is an authentic bluesy swagger, and wolf- like howl. When Bon sang it, you believed it. This is real bar brawl music and requires a swig of whiskey and some Camels to thoroughly enjoy.  These songs rock from start to finish, and with no dogs, this is just about as good as AC/DC gets. Highly recommended, especially \\"Night Prowler\\", one of the best ending songs ever recorded. Nanu-Nanu
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd's 1973 album Dark Side Of The Moon is nothing short of a rock masterpiece, and it certainly has the numbers to back up that claim. 741 consecutive weeks (over 14 years) on Billboard's Album Charts is a record, that even today, no other album has come close to by a long shot. The music and lyrics on the album make Pink Floyd's special brand of madness less threatening and more accessible to listeners. Wish You Were Here seems distant, exclusive, at times almost like a private joke, and we are invited only as spectators, to watch and listen, but not as participants. The Wall angrily points an acusing finger, and demands that the world conform to it's dark, twisted vision of hopelessness, and asks us to be suspicious of the world. Dark Side Of The Moon observes the world in a madman's peculiar way that most people can't, won't, or don't have time to, then records these observations in a reflective manner that leaves us to say, \\"Yeah, I never really looked at it that way\\". Musically, the album is a smorgasbord of style, mood, texture, and sound effects. The classic hit Money and Time both have extraordinarily searing guitar solos, not to mention that great, hard driving bass line from Money. The saxophone and female backing vocals play a prominent role on the album. There is an orgasmic, operatic scream-singing interlude by female vocalist Clare Torry. Us And Them is a strangely beautiful, thought provoking song about war and violence presented in an extremely emotional way. It's a masterpiece in and of itself, and one of the band's best songs. Dark Side Of The Moon is a musically satisfying experience that will leave you to your thoughts, to ponder, among other things, the beauty of madness.
0618680004|5.0|A short series of questions to Commentator #13:  <br /> <br />First: Commentator #13 asserts that \\"God is not a thing or a being like anything we have ever imagined\\" (para 6), but then speaks of a \\"weak [human] ability to sense God\\" (para 8). But a human \\"ability to sense God\\" (whether that ability be weak or strong, as some humans need eyeglasses and others don't) implies that God is like all the other phenomena that we can \\"sense\\" (i.e., see,touch, smell,taste,hear) without special technological instrumentation) but unlike, say, neutrinos--which we cannot \\"sense\\" without such instrumentation. On Commentator's own argument, then, it would seem fair to speak of a God as \\"a thing or a being\\" that is, not unlike many other things or beings, capable of being humanly sensed. Does Commentator regard this as a fair conclusion? <br /> <br />Second, does it also seem fair to add that the God type of thing or being is uniquely distinguiished from other things and beings by its omniscience (all-knowing)and omnipotence (all-doing)? Does it seem fair to claim 'beingness' for such a \\"thing\\" rather than leaving the matter ambiguous? <br /> <br />Third, is it fair to say Commentator's references to \\"virgin birth\\" and \\"resurrection\\" refer to the distinguishing characteristics just mentioned--that is, \\"virgin birth\\" refers to the birth of a partly omniscient and partly omnipotent God type being from a completely omniscient and completely omnipotent prior God type being, and \\"resurrection\\" refers to the death-to-life transition of a born partly God type being to a prior God type being?  <br /> <br />Fourth, given two such God types (one born partly God, the other prior and completely God), does Commentator consider it possible that the partly God type may regard the completely God type as higher than him/herself? In short, is it conceivable that one God may venerate another God as being higher, and that that God may venerate a still higher God, and so on up,higher and higher and higher? <br /> <br />Fifth, is it better for humans to worship the absolutely highest of all Gods than a lesser one, or does it matter? <br /> <br />Sixth, assuming it is better to worship the absolutely highest (or the only) God, does Commentator have an idea about how humans may avoid worshipping one of the possibly infinite lesser, perhaps miscreant and subtly devious (e.g., Satanic), Gods that may be (or are all Gods equally Godly)? In a word, if we worship a God, how can we know that we are worshipping the right one--or,indeed,whether there is a right one, or whether it matters? Is it conceivable that all Gods may be beneficent toward human welfare? And is it conceivable that all Gods may be injurious toward human welfare--that their omniscience and omnipotence may be engaged by aims to which human welfare is merely a sacrificial means? <br /> <br />Seventh, would Commentator say it is better to worship no God and be punished for that, or to worship a wrong god and be punished for that? What is the basis for Commentator's answer?
B000GIXLO8|5.0|Great movie. The DVD video quality is great, the menus are nice, and is nicely compacted in 2 DVD's. You should have it!
B000062XGG|5.0|I'm not usually one for action and too much excitement but this movie was exciting and funny and had a great message to it.  I loved the movie and I think you probably will too.
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale really was a great book. I couldn't put the book down.  It was a mystery with unexpected twists, likeable and complex characters, and an interesting storyline.  I was pleasantly surprised by the book.  My book club read it for our monthly meeting and when I read the jacket summary I did not think it sounded like something I would enjoy.  I loved it!  I love a good mystery.  Through the whole book I tried to guess what was going to happen and she surprised me over and over.  Gotta love that!  Great author!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is an outstanding set. The DVD or CD are each outstanding on their own, but together this is pure blues dynamite! The Godfathers of the Blues are kickin' it up and Kenny Wayne is basking in the glow.
B00003CX5P|5.0|A DVD everyone should have in their collection. Very nicely made menus, great DVD quality.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Theres a reason why this miniseries has a 5 star rating. I've seen it 4 or five times and it just gets better every time i watch it. Everything about it is awesome, Day of Days, Carentan and Crossroads are my favorite episodes, but they are all incredible, for the most part they are all written and directed by different people but the whole series is very cohesive and it all fits together perfectly. The insight from the veterans and the attention to authenticity make this an incredible series. What also makes Band of Brothers incredible is that the men portrayed in the series are real, they really fought and died, and it makes it much more of an emotional experience than Saving Private Ryan which had fictional characters. Don't get me wrong, SPR was great but for me Band of Brothers is more of an experience, you get so attached to these men that you really dont want to see them die, because they are real, that is really what made this special to me. The interviews with the vets before each episode are great introductions to what aspect of combat that particular episode was covering, and the thing that really got me was when at the end of the last eisode, they had some of the vets talk about it, and for the first time in the series it said who each man was, so you can see what they are like now, and you can see just how great the characters were cast.  <br /> <br />Overall this is pretty much the greatest war movie/series i have seen, nothing else had the same impact as this, and its pretty much a must have.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|Having already bought and seen this movie on regular old fashioned DVD its easy to see the difference. <br /> <br />First off, WOW, not only does the higher resolution bring out every detail down to the individual petals on the flower arangements but the colour and vibrance really bring to life the feeling of the theatre. <br /> <br />As for the sound, anyone using 5.1 surround sound will not be disappointed with the True HD sound Available but switch to a fibre optic cable and you will really notice the difference! <br /> <br />All in all, anyone who loves musicals will want this HD Movie, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />Well worth getting!
0060507772|4.0|This story is not as long as most discworld novels and it is not his best story, but it is in the typical Pratchett style. I enjoyed it (3 stars). The fantastic illustrations are worth a 4th star. You should have it in your Pratchett collection.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a great classic! Recommended for those mob lovers. Very nicely made.
B000002J2D|5.0|Anyone who liked \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" would enjoy this album, it's as good as any of the previous post-Gabriel era releases.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Meatloaf still can tell fantastic stories with his music. While his vocal range may not be what it once was, his words and imagery are still some of my favorite \\" go to \\" music when I need to feel the angst and fire of life. <br /> <br /> Allen Schweiger
B000MV9026|5.0|i received this in a very timely manner and it was as it said i will buy from them again
B00003CXCT|5.0|A great classic! It could not be better! This is something you should have in your DVD collection! Excellent!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Bar none.  I watched some of these episodes on my 64\\" Pioneer Elite HDTV.  Probably the best nature cinematography I have seen on HDTV of late or at any time as far as that goes.  I wish everyting on cable was in HD.  What a riot that would be.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Call Me Irresponsible is Michael Buble's newest and perhaps best Cd. It is very elegant music that helps remind me of a time when music talked of the respect one should feel for the power of love and passion. Thank you for reminding us that love is more romantic than lust. <br /> <br /> Allen Schweiger
B000J10ERO|5.0|i received this really fast and i like service like that. i will buy from them again
B000GBEWHA|1.0|I already purchased a grease movie and it has already been shipped to me. If you are over charging me and sending me something I didn't purchase please give me my money back. I have ordered alot of movies from this site and I am not satisfied with the time frame of recieving them or being told they are not available at one point and then being told I have an order confirmation for that order.
6305291446|5.0|The cast of actors-charactors blend in so well with suspense-its just unbelievable.  Ms.Jamie Lee Curtis and the cameo appearance of her mother working together is very nice to see-and historical (Ms. Lana Turner was in the orginial movie of the notorious thriller, \\"PSYCHO\\") and her appearance really contribute to the suspense to the movie-Halloween H20.  And seeing LL Cool J acting, WOW!  Mr. LL Cool J is a multi-talented performer-he can do it all! I just love this movie.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This item arrived in perfect condition and was exactly what I ordered, it even arrived a day earlier then what I was quoted.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I received this DVD from a DVD club we belonged to even though I didn't order it. I didn't know how I would like it. It turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen. Normally I can't watch movies that don't have a lot of comedy but I was able to watch the whole movie without getting bored. I would recommend this movie to anybody. <br /> <br />
1594200823|5.0|Excellent book for anyone considering where food comes from in the US.  It may also be funny for anyone living outside the US to read about how silly our food system is.  Corn, corn, corn, the author is obsessed with corn.  Although there seemed to be a few inaccuracies, and a few oversimplifications, the author was successfull in describing other choices on how we can all eat.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Being a life long Rush fan, i basically put their music in 2 catagories. Classic era and modern era. Modern era for me is everything after the Grace Under Pressure album. I rank Snakes and Arrows right up there with Counterparts. A must own for any Rush fan. The instrumentals Main Monkey Business and Malignant Narcissism are phenomenal and the best instrumentals since yyz. The drums and Bass are unreal in each as Peart and Lee show they have lost nothing as they age. The Large Bowl and Faithless are vintage Lifeson. His solos in each fit perfectly. The Way The Wind Blows is also very good and has a blues feel. Throw in Far Cry and Workin' Them Angels that both kick, and youve got a very good piece. There are a few throw away songs like Bravest Face and Good News First, But in general, every song is well crafted, well written and has the impeccable muscianship we have come to expect from RUSH. Its unreal to think these three aging Canadians still bring this quality of music after 30 years. I cant wait for the tour. So, in summary, do yourself a favor and get this cd. It is well worth it, and might be the last from the power trio.
B000O77RL4|5.0|I went in expecting to see a good film. I left feeling that I had witnessed fine art. Brutal, bloody, and unforgiving, but art nonetheless. The Japanese at this point of the war had to be running on false hopes of some miraculous  change in their fortunes. A change that would never deliver them from the fate that was quickly moving to devour them. Their willingness to persevere in the face of certain and overwhelming defeat confirms their reputation as brave and determined opponents.<br /><br />What the film does so well is to present their individual failings and humanity. They become much more than merely the enemy. They're recognizable personalities who have been thrust into the maw of an industrialized killing machine, without hope of escape.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Ruth Wilson was outstanding as Jane Eyre.  She completely captured the nuances and looks of Bronte's character.  Her plea with Edward Rochester \\"you think because I am poor, plain, obscure and little that I have no heart\\" transported me to that time and era in a manner that few other movies have done.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Finally, an album I can use for cruisin' in the car, or dance to if the mood strikes!  Cale's and Clapton's styles are wonderfully complimentary.  Sure, maybe the album is a bit reminiscent of the '70s, and doesn't explore new territory, but there was lot of FINE and fun music that came out then, which made us SMILE.  It's great these two legends chose to reiterate that feeling, including other notables to team up with them.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Great cd. By far Rush's best since Grace Under Pressure. Cut To The Chase  and Cold Fire are phenominal. Lifesons work on each is some of his best in quite some time. Animate is also fantastic. This release as well as Snakes and Arrows are the best two of the modern era (post Grace Under Pressure) in my opinion. To let you know of my favorites, The would be Hemispheres,2112,Farewell to Kings,Grace Under Pressure,Counterparts and Snakes and Arrows.... They have truely proven themselves to be one of Rocks legendary bands.
1400049628|4.0|Most books are funny because they don't take themselves too seriously.  What makes this book funny is that it does take itself too seriously.  It doesn't actually tell many jokes, (the few that are in there are very subtle) rather it takes a completely off the wall topic and tells you all about it with a completely straight face. <br /> <br />You'll be surprised with all of the information you'll know about zombies afterwards. And the amount of time you can actually spend talking about zombie survival and preparation with your future zombie survival team.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack!  Everytime I listen to it, I feel as though I am in Mexico during the revolution and Frida's life.  Everyone should choose their own life soundtrack and this one allows us to see into Frida's life more clearly.
076531178X|5.0|Wow,...I have to be honest and say that I picked up this book because I loved the sound of the title and the artwork on the cover. Needless to say I gave it 5 stars because I loved it. Truly refreshing is what comes to mind when I think about it. I enjoyed Elantris but not nearly as much as this book. I found the characters interesting and human. I actually cared about them. Not like other books where I am screaming for someone to die because I am so bored. I am talking about most of the books on the shelf today that lack originality and quality of writing. For a new author I must say that this book really impressed me.  <br /> <br />For me, the positives were: <br />1. Unique world building. <br />2. Original story. <br />3. Character depth. <br />4. Original magic system. <br />5. Not too many characters.(no offense, but some authors make me mad when they introduce too many characters because it's too hard to focus on anyone in particular, e.g.Martin) <br /> <br />I can't say that I found anything negative about this book except that I wish it had more poetry in it.  <br /> <br />My favourite series by far is Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. However, this book gets a whopping 5 stars from me because I am a very hard fantasy reader to please. Even Erikson does irritate me because I think he introduces way too many characters but this book had just the right number for me. I get bored extremely easily when I read but this book kept my attention. Excellent job, Mr. Sanderson, I am aching to read the next one. And for those of you out there who want something not copied from Dragonlance or LOTR, please pick this up. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000CNE164|2.0|While I agree with the reviewer who criticized the album for its short length, I dislike this album primarily because of the selections. In her liftetime, Nina Simone recorded many blues songs, only a mediocre handful of which are represented here. However, there are a few gems, such as \\"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl\\" and 'House of the Rising Sun\\" and \\"Do I Move You?.\\" Only buy if you can get it for under 5 dollars.
B000MV8AE0|1.0|Bad acting, horrible writing, and not enough music.  It was a painful hour and a half - do not waste your time!
1582701709|1.0|I still have not received the DVD on The Secret.  I would like my mony back.  It has been too long.  I ordered it last month.  Thank you
B000MRA5EM|5.0|A beautifully done adventure of amazing ocean creatures.  The visuals are great and it is very informational.  I was in awe as I watched the movie. My grandson is 8 and he loved it too.
B000002G8L|5.0|I've got this album on my mp3 player, and everytime a track comes on I'm back in my vinyl days.<br /><br />A mixture of Blues and Rock with Clapton regular Chris Stainton on Keyboards and Albert Lee on Guitar/Keyboards/Vocals.<br /><br />From the first track Tulsa Time you know you're in for a good time. This is a proper live album, no overdubs, no backing tapes just 5 guys and great music.<br /><br />Recorded in 1979 in Japan, neccessarily the sound quality isn't as polished as some might expect these days. Personally I prefer some rough edges and this double album gives it to you raw.<br /><br />Great stuff.
067003830X|5.0|Dr. Doidge's fascinating book appealed to me on many different levels. He has managed to synthesize and present a tremendous amount of important scientific information in a rich, compelling and readable narrative. As an Addictions Psychiatrist, this book has helped me in my clinical work. Specifically, Dr. Doidge illustrates how the plasticity process that \\"rewires\\" the brain to create addictions can also be utilized to \\"unwire\\" the brain from unhealthy patterns. This has important implications for the treatment of addictions.  <br /> <br />

B000CNFC76|5.0|I have read this book and enjoyed it so much.  I ordered this movie as a gift to my grandson who also loves golf and had read this book.  We both found that much was left out of the movie but then no movie can cover everything in a good book.<br /><br />The movie is about the Greatest Game Ever Played in golf.  It was the U. S. Open and two very popular players from England were in Bookline, Mass to play this event.  There happened to be a local young man Francis Auimet who lived next to this golf course and became fascinated with the game.  He would find balls that would land in their field and he made clubs out of hickory stick and would play his own game.<br /><br />He found he could become a caddie at Brookline so on certain times was able to play the course.  He was discovered to have a great talent and was sponsored to play in the amateur events.  During this U. S. Open he earned his way into playing this event  During the difficult days of the event he was tied with these two players from England Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.  Francis ended up winning on the 18 hole playoff.<br /><br />An amazing story and good movie.<br /><br />Letta Meinen
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is a fabulous boxed set, especially if you can get it at a decent price. It is available on-line and in some shops at very comptetitive prices.<br /><br />Alien and Aliens are already classics (as everybody knows) and merit repeated viewings.<br /><br />The 3rd and 4th are not up to the same standard but have their moments.<br /><br />There are 9 DVD's in total.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains both versions of Alien + Commentaries<br /><br />Disc 2 contains documentaries on Alien<br /><br />Disc 3 contains both versions of Aliens + Commentaries<br /><br />Disc 4 contains documentaries on Aliens<br /><br />I have watched these and they are very good. Especially in relation to creating the special effects and James Cameron working in the UK at Pinewood (there were problems - indeed almost a strike!).<br /><br />Disc 5 contains both versions of Alien3 + Commentaries<br /><br />Disc 6 contains documentaries on Alien3<br /><br />I have watched some of this and there is some fascinating information on the original script and director.<br /><br />Disc 7 contains both versions of Alien Resurrection + Commentary<br /><br />Disc 8 contains documentaries on Alien Resurrection<br /><br />Disc 9 More Extras<br /><br />All in all a superb set to get.
B00005JL0I|2.0|Can you name the second, third, and fourth actors to play James Bond in a movie (Sean Connery, of course was the first).  If you guessed Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, you're wrong.  That's right, George Lazenbery proceeded Moore, but you're still wrong.  The correct answer is David Niven (as James Bond), Woody Allen (Jimmy Bond) and Peter Sellers (as a James Bond imposter, though he fit the Bond suaveness well).<br /><br />I was very curious about watching this movie.  I felt it was a waste of time.  It was funny, and the acting was good, but I did not like it.  Part of it was that it was too sexy for a fundamentalist like myself.  Another part is that the plot meandered too much.<br /><br />I will say the climax was hilarious.  There were some good car chases.  But this could have been better.<br /><br />If you like comedy (I'm not a big comedy fan), especially the late '60's style, and you want something a little more risque, you may enjoy this; don't let my negative review scare you off in this case.  I didn't really enjoy it.<br /><br />One last comment.  Peter Sellers and Woody Allen were given top billing, but really David Nivens carried this movie.
B000MXPE88|3.0|Delivery was quick and prompt but for those who have a HD DVD  will need to upgrade DVD player to play HD portion of DVD. It will only play standard version.
B000002UDB|5.0|Love all the songs in this CD except maybe \\"Flying\\" because I'm not familiar with this song. This music was originally created in 1967 and it still sounds good to me forty years later (2007). I have a collection of almost all the Beatles CD's and this is one of my absolute favorites.
B00009MGGI|5.0|Excellent. Acting superb. Story line superb. I highly recommend. Very much in tune with what is going on in the real world.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|While I'm a big fan of the Beatles, I'm not a rabid one. However, listening to these songs after they've been 'toyed' with a bit, makes me want to reconsider my stance. It had been years since I REALLY listened to them and this CD definitely got me interested in doing so. There aren't any hokey re-mixes or overtly strange combinations, instead they are thoughtful and musically provoking ones that stay true to the originals' integrity. This is really a joy to listen to, whether you've seen the Cirque show or not. Especially so if you have!
B000N6TX22|3.0|prompt delivery but once again those with HD DVD player will need to upgrade. Will only play standard version.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is not the story in P. D. James's book, but it is not a disappointment at all.  It is believable and frightening, and very well done.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|It is a wonderfull music by this genial author. However, as a different and  special music you must be used to it to appreciatte this kind of sound
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie at her best and what a treat it is to see her at the various stages of her career. Always a hottie, she sizzles at times on this CD. Anyone who is a Stevie Nicks fan will love this CD, with songs and clips from Her early days right up to the present.
0937381888|3.0|This book has the same information of nearly every other beginning book. I had hoped it might have a little extra, but it is VERY basic. A disappointment. I can recommend it for someone just beginning, but even then, I prefer Joy of Homebrewing. This one just didn't have the same fun tone, and also didn't have anything new or updated. I returned it.
0151013047|2.0|I second the frustration, which arises due to the monologue style employed by Hamid. I couldn't identify at all with Changez's (nobody in Pakistan would name their son after Genghis Khan) character. The ending is weak, if not awkward.<br /><br />Mohsin Hamid's first novel \\"Moth Smoke\\" was a much better read.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  It also included 3 music videos on the DVD side of this CD.  This CD a must for anyone who likes Rock & Classical with a Spanish edge.
0143038419|4.0|I didn't select this book on my own and under normal circumstances would not have chosen it; it was a book group selection.  In spite of my initial hesitance, I found myself enjoying this book immensely.   Elizabeth Gilbert is a talented and entertaining writer.  Aside from the middle section (\\"India\\") where her ruminations on spirituality bogged the book down a bit, the narrative is clever, witty, and delightfully insightful.  I am eager to read more of her work.
B00005JPPL|3.0|Cris Johnson (Cage) can see two minutes into his future.  It helps him avoid things he wants to avoid, and excel in things he wants to excel in.  His gift also lets him look more than two minutes ahead into the life of Liz (Biel), a woman he has never met.  While he is searching her out, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Moore) is tracking him.  She knows what he can do, and needs his help to stop a nuclear bomb from destroying Los Angeles.<br /><br />\\"Next\\" could have been so much better.  In fact, for the most part, it is better.  The twist in the last ten minutes of the film and the abrupt ending thereafter works to undermine all the good stuff that has gone on before.  In fact, without those last ten minutes, this probably would have been a 3 ½ star review.  People generally like or hate Nicholas Cage, with little grey area.  I fall into the former category, and appreciate his off the wall take on most characters he plays.  He is good as Cris, a man haunted by what could happen.  Jessica Biel is adequate as the love interest, and Julianne Moore gives her usual good performance.  The problem with the movie is its attempt to be clever at the end.  While not cheating, it establishes the character of Liz as a mere plot device and robs the audience of a satisfying colclusion.  I recommend waiting for DVD to see \\"Next\\".
B0000CABJ1|5.0|its a double cd and it is excellent listening. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fast music.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is the greatest rock/metal/experimental/intellectual based band of this vulgar era. Aenima is just a piece to their quartet explosions of next reality laden experiences.

B000NVIXFK|2.0|Production notwithstanding, this album is SUCH a step backward from Vapor Trails (not that that was a great album, but it was at least catchy and listenable besides the horrible digital clipping).  <br /> <br />A few basic problems with this album: <br /> <br />1) Not catchy whatsoever...at least Vapor Trails was memorable and rocked besides the clipping noise. Rush's gift always held true the fact that they could write what was seemingly on the surface a 'catchy as hell' memorable simple song that only took one listen to remember...but under the surface was technical as hell (Red Barchetta for a great example of a totally 'accessible by anyone' song that's also amazingly complex and intricate yet it takes NOTHING away from the catchiness and doesn't overwhelm-or underwhelm-the casual listener). Rush have completely lost both the ability to be both catchy and complex on anything above an elementary level.  <br /> <br />2) Boring musicianship...this is supposed to be RUSH; \\"holding back\\" for the last 17 years is NO LONGER a valid excuse. I HATE it when mindless Neilsheep state \\"It's so cool to hear Neil just sit back, groove, and not overplay\\" for the MILLIONTH TIME as if he's been playing at \\"Natural Science/Cygnus X-1/Subdivisions/Losing It/Jacob's Ladder/Marathon/Mission/The Fountain\\" caliber constantly for the last 30 years! HE'S BEEN \\"HOLDING BACK\\" FOR FREAKIN' DECADES! C'MON, BLOW US AWAY FOR AT LEAST 20 SECONDS IN ONE SONG! Dammit, this is supposed to be Rush. Throw us at least ONE thing that makes us go \\"WOW!!!!!\\" again! And all the blind supporters need to STOP reciting what others say about \\"It's so great they are going subtle\\"...they've been subtle since 1990! It's time to STOP with the lameness! Stop making excuses! <br /> <br />3) Neil's lyrics can't possibly get any worse. STOP USING THE GRADESCHOOL SIMILES AND METAPHORS!!!!! EXAMPLES: <br /> <br />\\"LIKE A CORAL REEF\\", \\"LIKE A GHOSTRIDER\\", \\"LIKE A MOUNTAIN\\", \\"LONELY THINGS LIKE NIGHTS\\", LIKE SURRENDER\\",\\"LIKE MALICE\\", \\"LIKE LOVERS AND HEROS\\", \\"LIKE EMPIRES\\", \\"LIKE THE TIDE\\", \\"LIKE PRIDE\\", \\"LIKE HURRICANES\\", \\"LIKE LOVERS\\" \\"LIKE BIRDS OF PREY\\", \\"LIKE DANCING GIRLS\\", \\"LIKE A MILLION LITTLE DOORWAYS\\", \\"LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD\\", \\"LIKE THE HEART OF THE EARTH\\", \\"LIKE A TIMEBOMB\\", \\"LIKE A STRANGER\\", \\"LIKE THE CHINESE CALL\\", \\"LIKE A RARE AND PRECIOUS METAL\\", \\"LIKE A RIGHTEOUS INSPIRATION\\", \\"LIKE A TEARDROP IN THE OCEAN\\", \\"LIKE A STEELY BLADE\\", \\"LIKE AN HOURGLASS\\", \\"LIKE A SHIPWRECKED MARINER\\", \\"LIKE A PAIR OF VAGABONDS\\", \\"LIKE A WOLF IN THE SUN\\", \\"LIKE WE'RE BACK IN THE DARK AGES\\", \\"LIKE CRUSADERS IN UNHOLY ALLIANCE\\", \\"LIKE THE SOLITARY PINE\\", \\"LIKE A STONE IN THE RIVER\\", \\"LIKE THE WILLOWS IN THE WIND\\", \\"LIKE A FOREST BOWS\\", \\"LIKE A FLOWER\\", etc... <br /> <br />You get the idea!!! They should change their name from Rush to \\"LIKE\\"!!! You can TELL that Neil didn't finish school. I think by about the 11th grade, English classes wouldn't ALLOW you to write such simple mindless idiotic similes or you'd instantly fail the assignment. Lyrics so inane come across as being written in 30 minutes...just in time to skip town to head back out on another Middle America hateride. Neil's lyrics appeared \\"intelligent\\" when I was 8. Funny thing is, however...they didn't get gut-wrenchingly bad until around 1990. I think Neil does it now on purpose just to fuel his own disdain for the fans (\\"Let's see what kind of crap I can write that these imbeciles will think I'm God for writing...they'll fall for anything\\"). C'mon Neil...the juvenile nature of your lyrics and uneducated writing style is beyond insulting at this point.  <br /> <br />4) Geddy: please use an amp. Get a real bass sound again. And stop that \\"chunka chunka chunka\\" flamenco crap and play some melodic, memorable, catchy, and amazing bass lines again. Stop being so basic. And, did I mention a real amp? Hey Geddy, there's an album with a great bass sound on it. You might like it. It's called \\"Moving Pictures.\\" It's also called\\"Signals.\\" Hell, even though it's completely different, \\"Power Windows\\" at least has a unique bass AMP sound. Your current bass sound sounds like a ProTools plug-in.  <br /> <br />5) And to the fanboi's and fangurl's: Learn to think on your own. Just because you read online that one person says, \\"I hear traces of all eras of Rush in this new album,\\" DO NOT endlessly post this same mindless drool over an over as if you think it yourself. If Geddy said, \\"Yes I used the same bass tone as I had on Caress of Steel\\" (while clearly he did not) there would be 100's of fanboi's sprouting, \\"The bass on the new album sounds just like 'No One At The Bridge!!!!!!!'\\" just because they read that Geddy said something to that effect. Kinda like how people are saying, \\"The new album is a return to Rush's roots.\\" Yeah? Where??? I don't hear anything whatsoever similar to anything except 90's era Rush. \\"This new album represents all of Rush's past.\\" Really? Where's the Power Windows era represented? Funny, I don't hear any synth. Or did you fanboi's forget that the 80's were dominated by very imaginative synth work? LEARN TO THINK FOR YOURSELF. AND, STOP REPEATING WHAT YOU READ ON THE INTERNET AS IF YOU THOUGHT OF IT FOR YOURSELF, ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN OFFER NO SUPPORTING EVIDENCE AS TO WHY YOU ARE SPEWING YOUR UNFOUNDED WORDS. Just like all the fanboi's posting \\"This is the best album since Hold Your Fire!\\"...\\"The best since Moving Pictures!\\"...\\"The best since 2112!\\" all because they READ it from SOMEONE ELSE.  <br /> <br />It's almost as if...how completely DEVOID can Rush become of RUSH until ANY of the fanboi's realize it? It seems that as they get rid of EVERY ounce of what MADE them \\"RUSH\\", the fanboi's EMBRACE it! Geddy's singing lower! Great! Geddy's more monotone! Great! Neil isn't doing much of anything! Great! These lyrics are so deep LIKE a gradeschooler wrote them! Great! The drums still have that 1987-era reverb on them! Great! Geddy plays nothing like his old self! Great! There's NO synthesizers at all! Great! There's NO long songs! Great! There's no catchiness! Great! There's nearly no guitar solos! Great! There's no instrumental virtuosity! Great! They're holding back! Great! They've been holding back since \\"Presto\\"! Great! They don't write fantasy epics! Great! They write pseudo philosophical \\"I'm better than you and here is what is wrong with the world\\" lyrics! Great! They lyrics don't really fit the music and sound forced! Great! Geddy continues to multi-track cheesy vocal sounds rather than use Taurus pedals! Great! Neil plays at his most elementary just to piss off fans who crave 1/100th of the old Neil! Great! They completely stopped writing strange time signature parts and challenging musical passages! Great! They've written boring, bland, simple, contrite, uninspiring, unimaginative, and basic music! Great! But, they're having FUN! Great!!! <br />
B000HEWEE4|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this film:  it had such great potential but the story was fuzzy and the lack of clairity makes it fall flat.  Too bad, the actors were well balanced.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I was skeptical of Daniel Craig playing Bond, but after watching this movie he nailed the role perfect.  The story is also well written going through how Bond got the 007 title and watching his skills evolve to a top agent.
B00005U122|5.0|When I bought this DVD I didn't really know what to expect from Waters, being more of a David Gilmour fan I was a bit skeptical, but totally blown away nonetheless.  This is a must have for anyone who loves the late seventies/early eighties Floyd.  I hate to admit this, but I actually enjoyed it even more than PULSE.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|I aw this in the theater, and couldn't wait to add a copy to my own library.  Unfortunately, Sony has big problems with production of this DVD.  I have a JVC dual DVD/VHS machine less than two years old and this film will not play.  Anti-piracy software has been a problem that Sony acknowledges, and they cheerfully sent me another copy.  But that one doesn't play, either.  You can get to the menu, but when you hit \\"Play Movie\\" the DVD locks up.  If you go to the \\"Special Features\\" menu, you get a list, but no navigation icon, and the machine locks up again.  I understand that piracy is a problem, but when it keeps the audience from viewing a legally-purchased film, the \\"the tail is wagging the dog,\\" and something should be done.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|My family just loves this CD/DVD.  My son was amazed to see how songs are sung, and how Bruce can just say \\"give me some of this\\" and make up the opening to the song with sounds from his mouth, then have another musician play it on his instrument.  Very talented people.  We love folk music and this is a great collection of songs.  My son is practicing \\"John Henry\\" for his American Idol audition!!!!!  My wife loves it because you don't have to worry about the content (cursing, killing people, etc.).  It is just good old music, a happy CD.
B000088E6D|5.0|Excellent Music.  Vintage, soothing - I heard alot of <br />Frank in some of his tunes and I heard Michael too. <br />Unfortunately, be aware, there is a blank 1.31 selection <br />at the end.  I thought it was a unique defect, but it <br />was produced that way. <br />
B000059XUO|5.0|Received product very quickly and on time, and product was in very good condition... extremely satisfied with this order!
1881273156|4.0|An easy to read, common sense approach to Love.  Chapman provides a clear, concrete, approach to improving your love in marriage.  His reconceptualization of love provides a beginning and the metaphor of a \\"love tank\\" is similar to John Gottman's emotional bank account. <br /> <br />Each of us has a different love language, plan and simple.  We need love our spouse in their love language.  Simple and effective! <br /> <br />It is a good book for the marital therapist and the marital partner looking at saving or improving their marriage.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|A Favorite Film. many layers and subplots, some more obvious than others.The characters are so believable I am suspended in the Italian Country side during WW11. Incredible sets and cinematography immerse the eye. It touches every sense..from ink on textured paper to the tinkling of tiny bottles on a camels back. Letting us soar in the air then dip into a \\"Swimmers Cave\\" aa we feel the passion in unspoken resonance and grief in a place called  \\"Palace of the Winds\\". A love story within a love story, so entwined that they become one tale of many loves. Timeless.<br /><br />Katherine Rosengren
B00004RFFI|5.0|The movie was great seen it one thousand times, perfect condition and the seller i received my copy from was wonderful. Recommend to anyone who likes Tornadoes.
B00005ABIP|5.0|If you're a Cake fan, you've probably bought this already. It's slightly more polished than, say, \\"Pressure Chief\\" (still my favorite), but it still has that marvelous musicality and wry lyrics. If you're new to the band, I recommend you buy more than one CD to experience their extensive range of musical styles.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I really recommend this album. It is awesome for those who like 80's style music.
1582701709|4.0|What a delightful reminder ( from many pov's)that abundance does not mean the same to everyone: Asking for abundance is not \\"taking it away\\" from someone else.I enjoyed the many ways, the same message is presented here. By the end one comes away with the awareness that we are indeed living in diversity on One planet and we really can ..\\" All Have Enough\\" of whatever is needed or wanted. The non secret is now \\"out\\": By setting our intention and holding it in a  positive on going mind-set manifestation occurs i.e. Vision the end before the beginning then have the courage to follow the road to your dreams.<br /><br />Katherine Rosengren
B000MQ54OO|5.0|Not only is Happy Feet on of the best movies you will ever see - but the extra features on this DVD, alone, are worth the purchase.  Our two year old, our sixteen year old, and us all love this DVD.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|good product, great movie with excellent actors... one of my favorite movie!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The setting at the Slane Castle, the lighting, the costumes are nice. As usual, beautiful voices and music, beautiful women. Enjoy.
B000LC4CVA|1.0|There may be someone out there who enjoyed this - but I haven't met them.  Spare yourself the mistake I made, don't purchase this.
B000002GI0|5.0|every rock fan should have a minimum one title by John Hiatt from late 80'. He was strong and romantic, therefore fantastic.
0618680004|5.0|This has to be one of the most perfectly stated, eloquently written, fabulously well-put books I have ever read.  If you are an atheist and have had trouble organizing your thoughts on religion in a place where religious fanaticism runs rampant, this book is for you!  Page after page Dawkins nails everything he addresses right on the head, from the fact that there is no god to the trouble and strife that religion brings our world.  Not only was this book EXTREMELY enjoyable and intelligent, it made me proud to be an atheist, which, like I said before, is sometimes difficult in a society that seems to grow more and more fanatical about religion every day.
B00014NE62|5.0|A really good movie taking place in in a society that shows love, even between men, is often struggled for. The acting is really good as are the wonderful sets and scenes. There is  some male nudity, which often occurs in the older films, strangely enough. This helps the story though as it takes you on this mans journey from a love that was very limited and hidden to a totally uninhibited love that conquers all barriers. Loved the movie and can watch it over and over.  Highly recommended
0060920432|5.0|An very perceptive piece of work that helps you grasp what contentment and a sense of well-being means, and how you can endeavour to achieve this. I wouldn't tag it as a self-help book, rather it's an illumination of what it means to be a human being, and how it's possible to find contentment in many ways and very importantly to be at peace with yourself.
1591841666|5.0|A very quick read that will stick with you long after you have finished it. I read it in under a couple of hours but have not stopped thinking about it since then. I highly recommend anyone who has ever felt they were not reaching all of their goals to read this right now.
055358202X|5.0|My son got me hooked on these books. I raced through the first four of George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" books and am anxiously awaiting his completion of the fifth in a series of seven. If you liked the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" you are sure to like these books.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An Inconvenient Truth is an award-winning documentary that chronicles Al Gore's involvement in educating others about the very serious impact humans, especially Americans, are having on our environment. I've wanted to see this movie for months and finally had the chance this weekend. This is a powerful film that, in my opinion, every American should see. I hope that seeing this film will get individuals thinking about how we affect the Earth and what we can do to help.  <br /> <br />What struck me about An Inconvenient Truth was that it included enough information to convey a powerful message without overwhelming the viewer with facts and figures. It was simple enough to be understood by someone who might not be familiar with environmental issues which I think is especially important. Charts and graphs were included when necessary to define the climate changes we have experienced and will experience for years to come if lawmakers don't act soon.  <br /> <br />I also liked the fact that An Inconvenient Truth focused on the environmental issues rather than politics. US policy was discussed, but I felt that, in general, the filmmakers did an excellent job of reaching out to a bipartisan audience. Viewers were shown well-researched data regarding global warming, including powerful pictures and other graphics that enhanced the viewer's understanding of the issue. While Al Gore was featured in the film, his life was certainly not the focus. Instead, the story of his passion for this cause left viewers like myself feeling informed as well as inspired to take action and speak out about this issue.  <br /> <br />While many reviews of An Inconvenient Truth can be found online, I thought Roger Ebert's review of the film was very good. I also enjoyed A. O. Scott's New York Times review, finding it especially insightful.  <br />
B00009MGGI|5.0|Saw this production when first shown and was so thrilled that it was available on DVD. Still the VERY BEST PRODUCTION EVER MADE. I had forgotten the ending and some of the intrigues so it was like seeing it anew and as thrilling as the first. If you don't like this one, can't imagine anything you might like.
1582701709|4.0|I have a few books I like to reference in the morning to get my mindset on track, usually being this one and Chopra's \\"Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.\\"  My problem with this book is that it comes off as slightly inauthentic.  Why?  Because it has very successfully, and continues to do so as you read it, marketed itself to the public.  The book is charged with buzz words like \\"turbo-charge\\" to give you the idea that it is really that easy to manifest what you want.  In essence, I believe it is actually so easy it is hard, if that makes sense.  But here's the thing: it markets itself to people by being the \\"answer\\" to your hopes and dreams.  Great.  The problem I have sometimes is how much it refers to the \\"answer\\" as being something outside yourself--money, a spouse, a beautiful house, vacations.  Granted, Rhonda Byrne says many times that the real secret is to FEEL GOOD NOW, and to be thankful.  However, I feel that some of the commentators' comments in the book contradict that.  As often as it tells you to embrace what you have now, it also keeps putting the carrot in front of you telling you that you can have a multi-million dollar mansion and a beautiful wife (as one of the people mentions he has--blech).  In my understanding, wealth should never be your goal.  Spiritual enlightenment and service to the world should, wealth hopefully being a byproduct of that.   <br /> <br />In its defense, to get the word out there and to market to people wanting a better life, and then revealing that spiritual awareness is the key is ok.  I just feel like it's definitely very carefully marketed, which makes me feel like I'm being lied to, as many people do when they feel someone is selling something. Is spirituality something to be sold?  Well, if it works, why not? <br /> <br />The other main beef is how little it mentions contributing to society, making it somewhat selfish for a \\"spiritual\\" book.  The reason I compare it to Chopra's book mentioned above is becuase I believethey both say the same thing with different approaches.  I think Chopra's really comprehensive and specific about process and ideas, something Byrne is a little wishy-washy about.  For instance, the 3 steps are ask, believe and receive.  But the 2nd and 3rd are the same thing, arean't they?  It even says for #2, \\"believe that you have received.\\"  Kind of redundant and weak for a \\"process.\\"  Chopra's book--and many others--bring up that self-fulfillment can only come from spiritual fulfillment, and an understanding of your place in the world as a whole.  Byrne says to give becuase it shows you feel you have enough to give, but shouldn't you give because when you give to someone else it's A. the right thing to do, B. the nice thing to do, C. we are all one, and must keep the flow going, or D. all of the above?   <br /> <br />Ok, so now I've gotten that out, I gave this book 4 stars because I DO reference it almost every day, and every time something resonates with me and gives me hope.  I think Byrne is delightfully non-pretentious (while some of the other people are, however), and heartfelt in her intention to get the message across.  And how could you EVER, EVER not applaud something that tells people to creat their own future, take responsibility, live in the now, be good to one another, and go after your dreams? <br /> <br />I think of this book as more of an inspiration rather than a how-to.  The how-to part is actually very difficult.  Controlling your attitudes goes beyond conscious intent and can go deep into psychological patterns.    <br /> <br />And I would definitely recommend \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" over The Secret Movie, as it's much more in depth, structured, and informational rather than being a little infomercial-ly, like I felt The Secret was in comparison (but don't get me wrong--I still liked it!).
B000MGUZKM|5.0|This is a great CD and you can just imagine Joe Sample basically having a jam session with Randy Crawford.  The CD was the focus of a story on National Public Radio one day and that's when I learned about it!  It exceeded my expectation!
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Really good CD.  Has some great songs that I was surprised that haven't made it to the radio.  It's fun and interesting.  It won't be that 'classic' CD that you have to have but you won't feel that you wasted time or money when listening to it.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|This cd has a good selection of pop music including some danceable tunes.  I have listened to it several times and have enjoyed the upbeat and lively tone of the music.
B00008NRLX|4.0|I've been hearing Jayhawk songs for a couple of years now and finally bought this CD for 'Tailspin'.  It's a great.  I was on a long drive recently and had Rainy Day Music playing.  The sun was out, the windows down and it was the most relaxed I've felt in a long time.  These guys can write and sing like no one's business.  I plan on buying more of their music.
0064431622|5.0|This product was a wonderful addition to my teaching arsenal for animal adaptions. I gave the students an humerous start to thinking about the real life adaptions organism have that helps them survive.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|If you love beautiful voices, You will love Il Divo. As their #1 fan, I love all their music.
0060887966|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. It was recommended by a friend. I am not one to read for entertainment and have quit many a novel right smack in the middle because I find myself reading the same page over and over. This book I read in about 2 days. Most of the themes of the book are very common and at first it may seem cliche' but toward the end in about the last 30 or 40 pages I felt a strong sense of inspiration and I could not turn away. It gave me goosebumps thinking about my own life and the lives and experiences of those who are close to me. If there were a million other books of this quality, I'd own them too, but I doubt that many will compare.
0783226845|5.0|ANYONE THAT LIKES AL PACINO, WILL LOVE THIS . IT IS  GREAT. WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE.
0316010669|5.0|Malcom Gladwell is one of those rare authors who make your brain itch. His ideas are novel and fresh and his writing makes his profound concepts easy to grasp and chew.
B00005QGAT|5.0|THIS IS A FUN CD, THAT IN IT'S TIME WAS AND IS SO MUCH FUN TO LISTEN TO. THIS WAS THE MICHAEL JACKSON THAT WAS TALENTED AND HAD SO MUCH TO OFFER. IT IS A GREAT CD.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I believe Joihn Mayer grew as a musicioan for this album. I have greatly enjoyed listening...really listening to the songs in Continium.
B000002IAZ|5.0|WITH ALL THE GREAT VOCALS ON THIS, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. IT IS JUST A CLASSIC.
B00005K3O4|4.0|This is a must have for the horror enthustist.  It is a typical eighties cheesy horror flick, but a classic in my book.  If you love B rated horror movies from the eighties, then you have to add this to your collection.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary is a HUGE wake up call for every human being on this planet.  I think Al Gore did a most excellent job of illustrating just how dire global warming's effects are having on our planet.  The comparison between how earth looked even a century ago compared to today and the disaster that's waiting to happen in the VERY NEAR future is quite shocking.  Although I've felt for quite a while that Earth was in trouble, I had no idea just how serious the situation really was until I viewed this DVD.  Consequently, I believe that if each and every one of us don't IMMEDIATELY start doing our part to reverse the current course, there won't be a planet earth (as we know it even today) for our future generations to enjoy and be supported by.  I highly recommend this DVD and it should be viewed by everyone.
0060594896|5.0|I found this book to be extremely enlightening and empowering.  I had a wonderful childhood with loving and nurturing parents, but realized that many lessons learned in this book were not discussed or learned in my childhood.  After I read \\"The Success Principles\\", I purchased copies for my wife and older children and gave it to them for MY birthday, and asked that their birthday gift to me would be to read it and tell me what they thought.  How is that for an endorsement?  Share this book with the people you love.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Being an enormous fan of Spiderman and greatly enjoying the first two films, I looked forward in anticipation to this film.  I was greatly disappointed.  There was just too much going on in this film.  Where Doc Ock and the Green Goblin were fascinating villains with powerful performances in the other films, the Sandman was a very dry character and Venom was comical like Danny Devito's Penguin in the Batman movie.  Additionally, Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane was all over the place and never properly resolved in the end.   <br /> <br />The best part of the movie is the first battle between Spidey and Harry in his Goblin gear (though it is never explained how he mastered all the equipment and had a much bigger arsenal and better glider than his father).  Their succeeding conflicts do not have the same excitement. <br /> <br />J. Jonah Jameson's character is reduced to a much smaller role than the other movies and I was expecting more from Doctor Connors and the University in this film.  Even Aunt May is reduced in this movie and her only good moment is when she says that she would not take revenge on Ben Parker's killer and would be happy if something happened to him. <br /> <br />I put this film just slightly below the Ben Affleck Daredevil film.  Though the box office has been great so far, I think it will lose out on the repeat business from audiences (I saw the first two films in the theater three times each). <br />
0316010669|2.0|This book is a classic example of how good editorial style masks the flaws of poor writing. The thought leadership in Blink could fill a postcard--at most a sheet of note paper, if you wrote in big, loopy cursive. But Gladwell's anecdotes are entertaining (if loosely tied to the premise) and his prose clips along (if repetitively), making for a mildly entertaining read. <br /> <br />The first half of \\"Blink\\" is about why you should trust your instincts (the orchestra story). The second half is about why you shouldn't (the Amadou Diallo story). And very little effort is made to reconcile this self-canceling arrangement. As for the promised \\"how to improve\\" and \\"how to overcome\\" sections, they largely fail to materialize.  <br /> <br />On a positive note, the book is self-fulfilling in one way. My first thought when I saw Blink is that it was another phatic suit-narcotic. Now that I've read it, I can confirm empirically that my instinct was correct.
0446310786|5.0|A timeless treasure full of chronicles of the \\"old south\\" circa 1935 and the \\"new south\\" as seen through the eyes of an eight year old girl. This author manages to descibe in detail the lives of her characters with such reality that one thinks that you know them as the neighbor from down the street.This depiction of racism gives us pause to explore the way courts were in the south during this time period;where women were not allowed to serve along with other lower class citizens.I read this book forty years ago when it first came out and it was just as enjoyable today.  <br />
B000002U9Y|3.0|Pink Floyd has adapted to the times (thank goodness) leaving their older albums reminiscent of the seventies. Still a great trip down memory lane if you were into them back then.
1932100385|5.0|As a final year medical student, and someone with a long-time interest in nutrition, I really enjoyed reading this book.  I can imagine that parts of it may be a bit heavy if you didn't have university education in science, but the majority of the book is easy to read and absolutely packed full of facinating information.  The author outlines his study of nutrition in China (and elsewhere) and then reviews all of the other major relevant scientific papers on the topic of nutrition and disease, then ties it all together with some really practical information about how to eat well for optimum health (and weight loss or gain if that is an issue). <br /> <br />The final section of the book is about the relationship between the huge institutions of medicine, food production and governement, and it explains why we haven't received the dietary advice he espouses in order to avoid cardiovascular disease, degenerative disease, autoimmune disease and cancer, that we should have.  As a medical student, I can vouch for the fact that we didn't even get taught the simple fact that cholesterol is solely found in animal products (meat, dairy and eggs) and that if you avoid those foods you can significantly reduce your cholesterol, and therefore reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and other \\"Western\\" diseases. <br /> <br />If you want to read about nutrition, I would like to take this opportunity to recommend \\"Healing With Whole Foods\\" to you as well.  Also, visit Dr McDougall's website (this website is recommended by the author of The China Study and it's excellent). <br /> <br />On a personal note, I significantly altered my diet as a result of reading this book and I FEEL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! <br /> <br />Cheers and happy reading!
B000O178BY|2.0|trent is NOT what he used to be.<br /><br />it's a new sound.  a different sound.  sounds like some dude who just got garageband and found the distort button.... and i hate to say that about trent because \\"the fragile\\" and \\"downward spiral\\" sit at the #1 and #2 spots on my all time list.  he's a music genius, but YZ certainly is not.<br /><br />i wonder why it's so popular, and that could be attributed to his clever marketing campaign... maybe the music is a little more poppy or mainstream... maybe the slough of super fans will go out and buy it, like it, talk it up regardless of it's music prestige simply because its a nails album and it must be liked.<br /><br />i personally thought this album sucked and was by far his worst... 3 decent tracks at best.
B00000JPH6|5.0|There is just something about vintage special effects (e.g. models, puppetry) that computer generated graphics will never compete with. This is a beautifully, lovingly crafted film that I still enjoy as an adult. It's only afterwards that I think of all the blood, sweat, and tears that must have gone into creating these sets and 'muppets'. I'm still completely in awe...Dark and haunting. Another Jim Henson masterpiece.
B000O178BY|4.0|I haven't gotten hugely into the story and 20+ websites secretly linked to the album, but this is a good album.  A bit of electronic jamming too!  It doesn't hurt, too, that the cd changes from black to white when heated.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|It's great to order from Amazon. I don't have to waste gas going all over town looking for a rare movie that most stores don't have in stock. <br />Thank you.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I've loved this series since it first premiered on HBO. I am very happy to now have it in my home collection.
B00005JPFH|4.0|I thought that Spider-Man 3 was the best than the previous 2.  I'm glad that Toby did his best in this one as this will be his last appearance as Spider-Man.  Best of luck to the new actor who will replace him.<br /><br />In Spider-Man 1, I could not get over that metallic mask of the Green Goblin.  I mean, really!  In part 2, I guess I just wasn't fond of the whole Dr. Octopus storyline.  Anyways, you have to watch the first 2 in order to fully understand part 3.  But, even if you don't, you won't be entirely lost because part 3 will play some scenes from the first 2 as flashbacks.<br /><br />So, what's happening here?  Spidey is at his all-time high as the residents of NYC are loving him.  Life is just grand for Peter Parker/Spider-man.  He's in love with his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson.  He's even thinking of proposing to her.<br /><br />However, things immediately go downhill once Mary Jane has been booted from a Broadway play.  She finds solace in Harry Osborne, who is suffering from amnesia, because Peter Parker is too \\"full of himself\\".<br /><br />Predictably, Spider-Man finds himself in trouble...not just with one villian but with three!  Venom!  Sandman! And the Goblin (Harry himself).  Plus, Peter Parker is slowly losing Mary Jane.  The question is, can Spider-Man fight them all simultaneously?  Can Peter win MJ's heart again?<br /><br />Anyways, Spider-Man 3 is a wonderful film.  I love how they've added humor at the appropriate time and place.  My favorite part was when Peter was bonding with the Venom symbiote.  He's physically aggressive but at the same time, overly confident with the women around him.  He does these silly little dance movements.<br /><br />Marvel fans can spot Stan Lee anytime, anywhere.  However, I cannot recall if he ever had a line as he had in this movie.
0743496728|4.0|Picoult's book seems to be heavily inspired by the 1999 Columbine tragedy, which is referenced several times in the story. This book, only recently released, does bring to mind recent similar events in Virginia. She does a wonderful job of emphasizing the conflicts and emotions of teenagers faced with the inevitable rift between well-defined cliques in high school. Perhaps my own high school experience was different, but I found it hard to believe the extreme mistreatment of the shooter by the \\"jocks\\" and the \\"popular\\" crowd. I have never experienced, in my schooling experiences, such instances of bullying that were so humiliating for the victim, and where no one seemed to stand up or feel bad. I will admit, however, that at one point during the book I found myself completely sympathizing with the shooter and thinking \\"I'd do the same thing.\\" It does make you heavily consider your own experiences, and you may even feel conflicted as to who you think is in the wrong. The ending was a bit surprising, and even somewhat disappointing, and though one character's fate is not much of a surprise, it is for another.

0385040253|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read, of any category, fiction, non-fiction, bar none.  Yes, it is a book of knots, but it is far more than just that.  The author was an artist as well as a sailor and this book was the work of a lifetime of fascination with knots.  From an early age he took an interest in any knot he saw.  Knots were documented as to where he saw them, exactly how they were tied, who tied them and why, what their names and uses were, the knots' strengths and weaknesses, and any other pertinent information he could acquire.  Over a period of many, many years he kept these notes and finally wrote the book which is profusely illustrated by his own drawings of the knots and their applications.  As his knowledge became known he was sought out as a consultant by industrial firms and as a part of this work he also conducted testing of certain knots.  The book goes far beyond the knot names and their uses.  It explains why sailors tie decorative knots, why some knots are strong, why some knots are easy to untie, why knots tied by certain tradesmen have to have special characteristics. <br /> <br />Mr. Ashley had a keen sense of history and the book is filled with not only the history of individual knots, but the history of trades and how they utilized knots.  You can open the book to nearly any page and read a fascinating story about a knot, a vocation, a way of life, how and why people use knots, the different materials used with knots, or an episode in his own life.  The book can be read as a novel. <br /> <br />But if you are looking for practical information on a certain knot, or on a class of knots designed for a certain job, don't think that this information will be hard to find.  Each of the knots is numbered and is rated with a small drawing which is a symbol of the special characteristics of that knot.  Is the knot dangerous? is it weak or strong? Is it easy to tie?  Does it have many uses?  The same knots that are in different chapters are crossreferenced and other knots that can serve the same purposes but used in other trades are noted.  Thus the book can also be used as an encyclopedia. <br /> <br />I have a library of perhaps 1,000 books.  If, for some reason, I could keep only one, it would be this one. <br />
141694740X|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect from this book - boy was I pleasantly surprised!! It was a wonderful blend of humor, practical advice, and amazing insite into the male \\"mind\\"! Mr. Behrendt showed an amazing amount of understanding for women and how they view life versus men. I learned a whole lot of helpful tips and laughed a lot as well. I shared this book with 2 of my girlfriends who also had a history of bad dating/relationships and they were also impressed by the amount of help and humor in it.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Hopefully without repeating or rehashing much of what's already been said about this disc, I have to say I'm glad I waited about 25-30 listenings before weighing in with my opinions.  It's a lush and complex recording, probably the deepest Rush in an already deep pool of intense, intelligent thought-provoking material.<br /><br />I was initially disappointed in the overall less-than-upbeat tone of the whole package, and I struggled to decipher melodies and hooks because of the sheer weight and verbosity of the lyrics.  But I am thrilled with the sound quality, and with repeated listenings and growing familiarity have found many gems in this collection of 13 songs.  I have nothing but renewed admiration for the trio who have given me such joy over the years; each new album serving as signpost and virtual diary of my own existence.<br /><br />After two weeks, it's difficult to know precisely where to place this among the hierarchy of all Rush releases, but I'd put it up there easily in the top third.<br /><br />And in keeping with the trend here of validating my Rush fandom, if I were somehow forced to give up all my Rush CDs but three, I'd fight to hold on to Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, and Signals.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|this is a fantastic CD. I wish there was a DVD to go with it!
0800177177|5.0|A good film that for me sums up alot of what was good about early 1990s cinema. Oldman as dracula, Hopkins as van hellsing, Richard E Grant as Dr Seward, Carey Elwes as Arthur Holmwood and country legend Tom Waits as renfield make this film an extremely well acted peice. It is an alternative take on the book, much like the last temptation of christ was a different take on the life of christ. The bones of the story are there but some characters are more realistic and different. Van helsing is a pompus , lecherous alchoholic with a good heart, Seward is addicted to morphine and dracula was actually a victim of life but nevertheless a creature of darkness. <br />This movies best feature was that it showed vampires in an extremely unique and interesting way, they are not just normal guys with fangs and charisma like in the christopher lee draculas, but are powerfull creatures of the night, capable of flight, shape changing, mind manipulation and telekinesis. all together a fantastic romp.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|One fun album!. I really think Buble has one of the best arrangers going! Not only does he sound better than Sinatra or any of the guys before him, he makes the songs seem so fresh and new.
B00003CXAT|5.0|When I was driving home from the theater after this movie, I did look at birds differently.  I swore any minute a dinosaur could run out from behind a building.  This is and was the best dinosaur movie I've ever seen.  Who doesn't like a good dino movie?  And how old is it now and it still holds up well against other movies' special effects today.<br /><br />As for the story, some will say it's slow, but I think the pacing is perfect and although kids now a days might think there isn't enough action, I think the build up to the first time you see the Tyrannosaurus Rex attack is one of the greatest moments in movie cinema.  It's intense, scary, even funny, and best of all you don't think about the special effects because you're watching a real 8 ton monster wreak havoc.  The movie is worth this scene alone and then when the raptors come you'll be jumping and at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Love this movie.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|I do not want to say to much about the movie. I personally like it a lot and think it's the best Game to Movie transfer ever so fare. I played the games, i loved the Games (especially the first!) and totally find the feeling and ambience perfectly transfered into the Movie. So if your into the style and mood of the Games i guess you enjoy the movie. <br />Thats the reason why i bought the BluRay, allready owning the DVD - i hoped for a great picture enhancement to a good movie. <br />Well, to tell the truth, there is not much of that since the DVD had a great digitally Transfer, the BluRay does not offer much more. Only fare away sceens look a bit shaper, but since most of the movie is closeups or flying ashes is cutting the deept anyway - you won't notice most of the time. <br />Sound is nearly the same as on DVD, a little better due to a higher datarate, but it's not worth buying the Bluray if owning the DVD for it eather. <br />I use a PS3 over HDMI conected to a Mitsubishi HC5000 frontprojection (Full HD). <br />Sidenote: Best BluRay regarding Best Picture Quality i found so fare: Happy Feet!
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This is a good cast and a fun story, and what I really like about it is not everything they do works for them the first time, so it seems more realistic that way.  There's suspense and action and great characters.  Theron and Wahlberg play off each other well and are both great actors as is most of the cast.  I highly recommend this if you are into the \\"root for the theif\\" type of movie.  It's one of those movies where everyone's a bad guy and you get to root for the anti-hero.  Oh and Edward Norton plays a great bad guy.  You really love to hate this jerk.<br /><br />Nothing unique, but loads of fun.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South brings industrial England of the 19th century into your home.  The sets, actors and drama are so real and vivid, you feel you are there.  Richard Armitage and Daniela Denbe-Ashe are phenomenal, as are all the supporting actors.  This is one of the finest, if not the best period piece I have seen come out of Britain.  The screenplay is very true to the story and provides a compelling plotline throughout.  If you enjoy period pieces with a good romance, you will love North and South.
B000N3ST8O|4.0|Sometimes it's a bit too easy for me to laugh at Stevie Nicks' `good witch' image, with the silken capes and all the twirling about, but the last laugh has always been on me, because her music always manages to leave a mark. Looking back, I might chuckle now at some of the dated imagery and her huge hair, and cringe a bit at the dated production values, but her songwriting and songcraft is no laughing matter.  Her contribution to Fleetwood Mac has been monumental, and as evidenced by this collection, she has also fared quite well as a solo artist.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Visions\\" focuses exclusively on the solo output of Stevie Nicks, so fans of \\"Rumours\\" or \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" may be disappointed to learn that only one song here features her uber-famous bandmates (\\"Silver Springs\\"). The balance consists mostly of huge solo hits such as \\"Edge of Seventeen,\\" \\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\\" (a duet with Tom Petty), \\"Stand Back\\" and \\"Leather and Lace\\" (another duet, this time featuring Don Henley). \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Rhiannon\\" are also here, but in alternate or live versions that are mostly disappointing because they suffer from comparisons to the familiar versions that have become a part of America's collective unconscious. \\"Rhiannon\\" kicks off as a lugubrious piano ballad that soon morphs into a reasonable facsimile of the hit version. Comparably, \\"Dreams\\" fares much worse, because the synthesized dance-floor production is too trendy and has aged poorly.<br /><br />If any song should have been revisited, my vote would have been for a complete reinvention of \\"I Can't Wait.\\" My ability to fully appreciate \\"Crystal Visions\\" is occasionally hampered by the 1980s production values, and \\"I Can't Wait\\" serves as a perfect metaphor for everything bad about that era. If you can listen through the haze of tacky synthesizers and processed drumbeats, there is a good song underneath it all, but it takes effort to see the beauty underneath the excessive makeup. \\"Talk to Me\\" suffers similarly, with booming percussion and echo effects that render it into something Scandal might have recorded (not a good thing in my book). Surprisingly, though, Nicks avoids this trap on most tracks here, and the result is ultimately quite pleasant, if not perfect. A second DVD disk features a generous offering of videos, all of which are accompanied by an optional commentary track. Throughout, Nicks is focused and informative, and the insights of her commentary provide another excellent reason to obtain this collection, especially if you've been a longtime fan. Additionally, the booklet's liner notes are also very generous and a fun read.  B+  Tom Ryaning percussion and echo effects that render it into something Scandal might have recorded (not a good thing in my book).

0316010669|4.0|Ironically, my first instinct seeing this book was that it would probably be a collection of subjectitvely picked research to back some unconvincing hypothesis of overstated importance.  Well of course part of that was true, after all Gladwell is a journalist and not a scientist.  However, in general, he does a great job in describing the research and its relevance to our everday lives. <br /> <br />Blink focuses on 2 seperate but related concepts.  The first is that of \\"time slicing\\", which demonstrates how important information can be encoded in a very short period of time.  Most of Gladwell's examples are socioloical, and the most striking of which was research which aimed to predict whether married couples would get divorced after analyzing a single conversation with them. <br /> <br />The other concept is how the brain acts subconsciously to certain stimulus.  Gladwell's proposal is that if we can recognize this power of the brain we'd make the world a much better place and all sorts of other grand things.  So, although not perfect, this is a good and interesting book.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I saw this movie at the theater, and had to have it for my home library. Definately a \\"chick flick\\". This movie was done by the same person who did \\"Something's Gotta Give\\", which I love as well. Funny, witty, smart dialogue. A cute plot, nothing heavy, just fun and romantic. I saw myself in both characters. I highly recommend, great cast as well, the acting was very good, each actor great in their roles.
B000053VAZ|5.0|What a great film this is!  The acting is superb and the story line believeable, interesting and fun.  A great love story of a brother for his sister,  and then to let her go when she finds a hansome fun character who idolizes Buster Keeton.  They fall in love and live a life of deep caring and fullfillment in a way not thought possible in the beginning of the film.  The music is great too.

B000002U9L|3.0|They used the rejected version of Dance Magic, wich can be seen as an extra in the DVD release. After hearing it, I can understand why they opted not to use it in the movie. It would have been nice if they'd added BOTH versions of the song on the disc, seeing as it has few songtracks & has both versions of Underground. To this day, aside from maybe 3 other songs he sang in the early 80s, this is the best music I've ever heard from David Bowie. (Does his face age at all? He looks just as young today.....)

B000001FSU|5.0|I own all the Belladonna years material (don't bother with the John Bush stuff).  I really don't understand why the fans dog this album.  This album showed their serious side, but also retained their goofiness.  Perfect balance.  It boggles my mind that everyone is trashing the song '13'.  It's a quick little fun instrumental ditty, but people treat it like Anthrax was going for something big with it.  If you're new to Anthrax I'd say pick up this one and Spreading the Disease first.  Disease has bad production, though, so I'd say get this one first.  Among the Living is far overrated.

B0000268M6|1.0|Imagine if John Tesh composed music...oh wait, unfortunately you don't have to imagine. Well, Einaudi's muzak is of a similar caliber.

Seriously, if anyone compares Einaudi to Part or Reich within earshot, slap them. Good and hard.

B000N6TX1I|1.0|Don't buy the hype and selective critical success of this film.  Of the 40 or so movies I saw last year, this was the most disappointing.  As a fan of science fiction, I entered the theatre with expectations of this being a fascinating film made around an interesting premise - what happens in a world where women are barren and hope is dead?  But I left the theatre feeling cheated and robbed.  This film is not the cinematic masterpiece some have made it out to be - the setting is bland, colorless, and more grainy than gritty.  The characters are annoying, unsympathetic, and unmotivated in the sense that they have no reason to do what they do.  The film's themes are needlessly preachy - though you'll like it if you happen to be a liberal who believes in amnesty and open immigration policies.  Finally, the ending was a cop-out.  Instead of a resolution - most of the main characters wind up dead, you never find out what happens to the pregnant girl or why she's even pregnant in the first place, and the viewer is left unfulfilled by the experience.  Pass of this movie - there's a whole lot better science fiction out there.
0743537009|1.0|This was the first SK book I ever read, so I was excited to see that it was available in audio.  I loved this book.  Not so the audio version.  DO NOT listen to this book on a long trip.  It will make you fall asleep.  The story is still awesome - but I would have preferred it be read by someone with a little more interest in their voice. <br />
1591396190|3.0|This book focuses on the obvious, but often neglected question: What will delight the customer? <br />The book uses examples to convey the basic idea of blue ocean vs red ocean at the start and then builds on that understanding. <br />After having read his book, I have been able to utilize some of the concepts and skills to revise the business strategy of my wife's company for the better. <br />The book exposes the reader to ideas and concepts, but does NOT provide a failsafe strategy.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I purchased this because Ridley Scott spoke of the greater breadth of vision and enjoyment contained in his director's cut(he's right). I also purchased it because a recent trip to Israel brought home to me strongly that the world is still fighting the Crusades, and I wanted to be more in tune with the threads of that conflict to offer anything I can to end it. The director's cut satisfies more than the theatrical version, offering more nuances and insights into characters and their motivations,which in turn enhances the story. Also, it, and the extras for this edition, gives more of an education in appreciating both Christian and Muslim viewpoints and the differing views of the world that need to be reconciled.
B000N6TX22|4.0|Great movie, great acting. HD DVD looks great especially at the end with all the explosions, worth owning if you have HD DVD.
B000O178BY|2.0|I've listened to this quite a few times & it just isnt all that good. I dont understand all the 5 star ratings. The production value is fantastic as to be expected from Trent, except theres not much here that hasnt been done before & done better. This would make a great EP but as a full-length album its boring. How Trent sells so many records is beyond my comprehension. The concept for the album is awesome I just wish there was good music to back it up. I appreciate With Teeth alot more now(not that good an album but I was never bored)
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Talk about a clever story.  The satire is amongst the best I have ever seen.  The storyline is catchy from the start and you find yourself rooting for what by all accounts in any other movie would be the \\"bad guy.\\"  There are stories going on at multiple levels, which makes it entertaining from start to finish.  The writers deserve an oversized oscar for both a creative story and a brilliant concept.  If you like intelligent comedies, this is a can't miss movie.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Great DVD! My 7-year-old grandsons and I loved it! A \\"must-have\\" for anyone who owns Toy Story 1.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Great high concept movie, well done.  Intgrigue, mystery, and the dazzling and strange realms of magic and illusion in a period piece--why the 19th century?  Because it is the beginning of the modern age of mechanics, and magic is mechanics.  A good choice.  The only negative is probably the main obligatory thing: for magic to almost become real, and keep the audience guessing.  I saw that one coming, and they did what I though they would do.  That's the only flaw, and I'm not sure it's a flaw one could work around.  Edward Norton fans will be knocked out by his incredible performance.  It would get 5 stars except for the obvious plotting.
0743289684|4.0|I didn't know what exactly to expect from this book.  I found it to be complete enthralling.  It really brings to the forefront that Muslim women are exactly like us.  There are some who are completely rebellious and some completely submissive.  It also was very enlightening to realize that women are brought up to be completely submissive to their husbands[...].  I also thought that her attitude towards immigrants would benefit everyone greatly; [...].
1567315682|3.0|I came to this book with curiosity because I heard that it is a best-seller. Honestly, I'm disappointed a lot. If you have a good attitute to your money (frugal, long-term investing, budgeting, etc...), you do NOT need this book AT ALL. Furthermore, it is highly redundant. <br /> <br />I give 3 stars instead of 1 star because this book will be definitely an eye-opening one for those who have to increase their income to spend more. Easy tests for these are introduced in the book, for example, if you save or invest less than 10% of your annual income, you may need this book. If you have net worth of wealthy less than 4x your annual income, you may need this book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this version of Jane Eyre. I love that it keeps the spirit of the book while modernizing the language. I love the interplay of the characters.

Their histories and characters mesh.The music and photography added to the pleasures of this story. It was truly delightful viewing. All too short.
B000001DYD|4.0|One of her angrier, more energetic albums.  It has a lot of emotional resonance that is familiar to her work.  However it is unlike 'Stories from the Sea' which is more melo/alternative rock.  Overall, a good album.

You will definitely still enjoy this movie if you have not seen the series, but you may not follow some of the jokes.  The series is the finest ever on television, in my opinion.  Be sure to buy the Firefly series, as there was only one season, it isn't very expensive to own the entire series.  Help fund the possiblity of a triumphant return from Firefly!
0307236722|5.0|Well what can one say about Martha. Coming from Australian and not knowing much about Martha Stewart I tuned in to her show on the How to channel on cable TV in Australia. I was blown away by Martha and how she could do almost anything. I purchased her Baking handbook after it was previewed on the show and awaited it's arrival with much  anticipation and joy and this book has not disappointed in any way. Every recipe I have tried has turned out perfectly
B0000AQS0F|5.0|They seriously need to bring this show back.  I can't stop watching it.  It is the best television show I've ever seen!  You should definitely check this out if you haven't already!
1593083246|3.0|I decided to purchase this book after I watch the movie, to be honest, the movie is somewhat more entertaining than reading the book, the landscape is best describe in the movie. I need an extra effort to read every line in the book, word by word. Maybe my perception would be different if I read the book first, then see the movie.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I read the book twice.  I am currently reading the second book, Eldest, and will read the third book when it comes out (if it currently out, forgive me, I haven't checked yet).  This movie is as good a movie to see as the book was to read, and I completely enjoyed it.  I loved Saphia!  I love Dragons, having believed in the lore, the mythology of Dragons, as they were when they were on our side, not when they fought against elves and men.  Eragon was worth watching, I bought the DVD, and refused to watch it, until I had re-read the book, to remember what it was again, because movies can't fit in every detail and I didn't want to forget any part of the story while the movie was playing.  I thought it flowed well along the lines of the book/story line.<br /><br />Well Done.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|There are no real \\"fun\\" songs on this record, and I think that's what a lot of us miss.  But the songs are incredibly soulful and moving.  After many listenings, some of this material could be on 2112, some on Power Windows, and some on Counterparts.  It's a perfect mix of all of Rush's talents, except like I said no song where you get a chuckle. <br /> <br />Did get a little laugh from it being brought to us by the letter \\"sssssss\\".  :P
B00005JPCF|2.0|First of all, don't get me wrong, I'm all for saving the animals and humans on Earth - it is all we have at this time to leave for our children to live on..  But, to try and say that 'Happy Feet' was simlpy a cute little kids movie, was way off base. I am not sure little ones even understood the simple plot of \\"Everyone, if they are different, are ok\\".  Let alone the larger plot of we are destroying the land and outer lying lands of animals, causing problems we didn't know about, and we need to become more aware.  Yeah, the little kids really understood that!!  I think it was too long, too PC - just too P period.  I think its sad that I have to see politics in movies that I wanted to enjoy with my kid for a couple hours.  So, no I wasn't thrilled with the overly Fuzzy Wuzzy Save The Animals Movie.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Out of all 3 Buble albums, I'd have to say this is his best work. Don't get me wrong, I have and love his other 2 albums, but there's something about this one that is more emotionally raw. I can't stop listening to it. Great album, Michael Buble has done it again! It's rare to find an album where all the songs are great. Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed. A must have if you're a Buble fan.
1582701709|5.0|Great book!  I've bought so many copies as gifts to my family and friends and this book really changed our lives!  It may be a little difficult at first, not that it's difficult to read, but to change our \\"old way of thinking\\".  We all experimented with little things in our lives at first, and saw great results!  It's truly a \\"must-have\\" book - if you want a better life!
032147404X|5.0|I LOVED this book!  It is a must for digital photographers!  It gives great tips in everyday language so it's easy to use!  My photography practices have improved!
1594200823|5.0|I think every one in the United States should read the book and realize what we are eating in our daily diet.  So much is hidden and we don't know what is really in our foods or how it gets to us.
B00005JPCF|5.0|This is a lovely movie with a very good messages.<br /><br />All of us must see it.
B000000W6F|5.0|This is easily The Smashing Pumpkins' best album, and possibly one of the best albums of all time.  All cylinders are firing on this one; Jimmy Chamberlin's furious drumming and deft snare work is nothing short of brilliant.  It's no wonder why Corgan decided to later take on all instruments EXCEPT the drums.  Even with his growing ego, Corgan was wise enough to acknowledge that NOBODY could handle the kit (and still be musical as all hell) like Chamberlin.  Every drummer should be forced to listen to this in order to learn the true meaning of \\"tasty playing\\"... <br /> <br />The guitars hit you like a wall of bricks, and do it with a tone sent straight from the gods.  Nice and fuzzy, super thick, and clear as a bell; Corgan's layering of guitar tracks here is a technique that every recording musician, producer, or engineer should experience and remember.  In addition to the incredible performances and songwriting here, Butch Vig's production on this album is top notch and only serves to intensify the effect on the listener without getting in the way (as great production should).  <br /> <br />Forgive the expression, but this is balls-out gypsy rock and roll.  Buy this album even if you are not a Smashing Pumpkins fan.  In fact, buy this album ESPECIALLY if you are not a fan, because it hardly represents the albums that would follow, and those who came to learn of this band later on have no idea of what they're missing.   <br /> <br />10 stars across the board.  Don't even think about it.  Buy this masterpiece, and thank me later...
B000BP86OG|5.0|With the driving guitar riffs and screeching vocals, The Darkness represents a throwback to the glory days of bands such as AC-DC and Van Halen.  This is excellent music to drive fast to, or to work out to.  I discovered after being pulled in by their one big recent hit \\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\\" from their album \\"Permission to Land\\".  After hearing the tracks on this album, I realized I had stumbled on a hidden gem of a band.
B000NA28IE|5.0|After having become interested in The Lord of the Rings and of course Star Wars, it was logical to take a look at Eragon. I read the book in WA on a trip and will be buying the next two books. The author is quite talented and shows imagination.
B000M06K5C|5.0|While I love Silent Alarm, this follow-up album is surprisingly stronger. A clear new direction is being forged by the band as they are growing into their own.  Already excellent the first time around, it somehow manages to get better and better with each listen as each song lends itself to the overall cohesiveness of the album.  Highly recommended.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|A should have DVD in your collection!  The special features are awesome!  John and Olivia reunited again on stage...wow..lots of emotions there!  Buy it, you'll enjoy it as much as I did!
B000MV9026|2.0|The best part of this movie was when the little pengiun was dancing.  This movie is to advanced for small children.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I certainly enjoyed watching Dirty Dancing over.  The special features are nice.  Lots of memory.  The only thing is there are no interview with Patrick Swayze...really strange...
B000BI0WOA|5.0|This is an excellent 2 disc set for long time Dire Straits fans, and those who are new to Mark Knopfler's music. The first song is \\"Telegraph Road\\", which is best enjoyed driving down a long lonesome highway. I find myself skipping around a bit after that, trying to follow the orginal sequence of songs in the albums that are represented. Good tunes, and most excellent road music!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I was glad that I bought it.  My kids 8 and 5 yrs old love it as well.  Now they want to take Karate lessons...
032147404X|5.0|This book is an excellent reference. It gets straight to the point on some of the most common issues that photographers face during shoots. I like the fact that it spares me the techno-babble and gets right to the techniques I want to accomplish. In this case size also matters in the sense that the book is not very large so I have a tendency to always have it when I need it.
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is one of the best exercise program!  I have tried it years ago and lost 20 pounds in 3 months, with a diet.  I just purchased it again to repeat that goal.  Cindy is really great in this DVD. She explains well what to do and it's easy to catch the steps...
B000NVIXFK|3.0|All I can say is please lose the atonal parallel fifths in the vocals and the muddy power chords and give us those wonderfully melodic tunes that peaked with Test for Echo. I really miss those tuneful guitar hooks, Peart's manic drumming, and Geddy's simple but colorful synth parts. Nobody could combine those elements like Rush could.  Plus, in albums like Power Windows, Presto, and Roll the Bones, there were always lots of spaces in the music, that is, spaces between the notes.  Snakes and Arrows sounds as if every aural space and frequency and every measure has been completely filled in. <br /> <br />I know Neil, Alex, and Geddy are outstanding songwriters, but it seems as if they have consciously attempted to sound like so many other metal bands who don't have an ounce of the melodic invention they possess. You can be heavy and melodic: witness Driven, Red Sector A, or The Big Money.  <br /> <br />What has not suffered are Peart's lyrical gifts.  He's dealing with some heady stuff and for good reason.  Still, it'd be great if the music matched the quality of the lyrics.
B000J103WK|1.0|I bought this specifcally because it said HD DVD. It was a gift for my mother and she owns a HD dvd player. It not only did not work in the HD DVD but on none of the other 5 DVD players we tried.
B000002ADT|5.0|THIS JAZZ ALBUM IS PPERFECT FOR HAVING A GLASS OF WINE AND CHILLING BEFORE DINNER OR WHENEVER YOU WANT. I HAVE IT IN THE AUTO SET ON MY PLAYER AND PLAY IT AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|My wife and I celebrate our 30th anniversary of marriage this year and remember this movie fondly from almost 30 years ago. We both agreed that every aspect of the movie seemed better than when we viewed it last. The story was easier to follow, the humour seemed more ironic and the music exceeded my expectations in it's placement within the movie. I was left wanting more. <br />
0307237699|5.0|I have not finished this book, though it's hard to find me outside of work without it in my hands! I love this book, it's an easy read and VERY interesting and educating. I am inspired to read about such an accomplished man who has maintained his genuinely kind nature and held on to his commitment to do the will of the American poeple and have the foresight to look and consider our children's and great-grandchildren's lives in the types  of policy he either authors and/or supports.  I look forward to a wonderful Presidential race!  <br /> <br />
B000NA77YO|5.0|Great CD!  I already have the three albums/CD's that Black Sabbath recorded with Ronnie James Dio, so I mainly bought it to have the three new songs that were recorded for this latest release. <br />The new three songs are really good, so I am glad that I spent the money to purchase this new CD.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|These two hours are by far the most I've enjoyed myself sitting through an action movie in my life. I won't pontificate on Craig as Bond, because the quality of the movie is stronger than that particular quarrel. Highly recommended.
0618680004|5.0|I am an atheist myself, so this book did not made any changes in my view of the universe. It did offer some great insights and arguments to be used when debating the issue with religious individuals capable of logical thinking and reasoning.  But again - as soon as you bump against a true theist with ingrained from the childhood system of irrational believes - no amount of reason or hard facts can make any difference.  Very well written book, which I truly enjoyed reading.  Also gave me confidence to openly say that I DO NOT have any respect for religion or people's unfounded beliefs in supernatural that caused nothing but suffering and destruction throughout the human history.
B000002KBU|5.0|Not a single off note in the entire record. This is the sole album that you should buy if you want to appreciate Joni Mitchell. Or women's music in general. Highly, highly recommended.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Wow! Let me just say, this movie is awesome. You're thinking, a movie about magicians. How lame. I know, I thought the same thing. The previews didn't really inspire me that much either. But this was a total surprise.<br /><br />The movie is about two magicians who are bitter rivals after an unfortunate event that occured at one show involving one of the magicians' wife. The plot follows them as they try by any means to steal the other's secret.<br /><br />I must admit, the ending was somewhat confusing. You had to be paying attention. I actually ended up wikipedia-ing it just to clarify some loose ends. But this movie, I can't even adequetly describe it, is amazing. Good for teens and adults.<br /><br />Kudos to Hugh Jackman for a great performance! If you liked this movie, I would recommend The Illusionist.
B000002KOJ|4.0|This record is a little samey, even for Joni, although most of the songs are just beautiful. My favorite Joni song, \\"Both Sides, Now\\", is included on this album, and it alone is worth the purchase price. But this is one of those peculiar products of its time, that seemed normal at the time and now seems windy, self-indulgent, and slightly ridiculous. Still and all, Joni has quite a lot of talent and it's in full flower here.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Movie trailer editor, Amanda of Los Angeles, CA and journalist Iris of Surrey, England live five thousand miles apart and have never met, but are dealing with the same problem: men. Amanda having just broken up with her cheating boyfriend, Ethan and Iris having pined for her ex, Jasper, becoming engaged to the woman he left her for decide to take a vacation during Christmas. They come upon a website called home exchange and swap houses for two weeks both with a goal to forget their troubled love lives. But love ends up finding them anyways. Amanda starts a romance with Iris' older brother, Graham, a book editor and Iris starts a romance with a movie composer named Miles. With new found romance, both their lives change forever.<br /><br />Let me say, this was a tear jerker for me! But they were tears for happiness, which is the best kind. I had my doubts as the movie started, but they were quickly dispersed. It's a sweet movie, definately girly and perfect for watching with girlfriends. Jude Law and Jack Black are awesome! Also good acting by Diaz and Winslet.
B000J103WK|5.0|We were not Eagles fans when they (and we) were younger, but after listening to this concert many times we definitely are now!  It's 2 hours and 40 minutes long and they sound great on every song.  Both the audio and the video are fantastic.
0743496728|5.0|Nineteen Minutes ties with My Sister's Keeper for being Picoult's best works. One of my favorite books.<br /><br />The story takes place in the town of Sterling. Peter has been bullied his entire life: shoved in the hall, pants pulled down in the cafeteria, private emails spammed out to the entire highschool. He finally snaps. One day, Peter brings for guns to school. He kills 11 people and wounds even more than that. Josie, daughter of a judge, used to be friends with Peter, until she started fitting in with the popular crowd. Her whole life is a constant worry that someone will find out that she's not as perfect as everyone seems to think she is. On the surface, she has it all. She's pretty, rich, and has an amazing boyfriend, Matt. Her world comes crashing down around her the day of the shooting. Matt is one of the fatalities. Picoult guides us through the past of Josie and Peter and shows us the devastating effects of bullying. We also see some familiar faces from some of Picoult's other books: Patrick Ducharme, Jordan McAffee, and Selina.<br /><br />An amazing book with a powerful ending. I highly recommend it!
B00014K5TQ|5.0|Okay, I'm going to sound contradicting here, but hear me out...  This has to be, by far, the WORST acting I have ever seen in my whole thirty-six years of being, HOWEVER, it contains comedic genius from Marilyn Manson, charm, wit and strange intrigue of Macaulay Culkin, as well as a fantastic soundtrack that is worth putting-up with the bad acting, all in itself.  I happen to be a big fan of the \\"Club Kids\\", including Michael Alig, James St. James and DJ Keoki, so it helps to know this is based on their whirlwind lives (although I honestly wasn't aware of that until I watched the additional features) (doh!)...  Most definitely a cult classic!
1591795230|3.0|Appreciated the research into this subject, however I felt it could have been presented in a more user-friendly manner.  I read, understand and finish many subject-related books, but stopped after a few chapters with this book.
B0002W18MU|5.0|Great album, even if Johnny's vocals were added posthumously,,, honestly , you can't tell, they have done it so well. For an almost heart-rending look into the true soul of the man nearly on his deathbed, give this album a listen
B000002MFE|2.0|This par I'm talking about here is not golf, where under par is good. This album just does not measure up to Clapton's other work. Cranking out albums because you can is not alway a good idea and this is a good example of such.
1881273156|5.0|Excellent.  Easy read, straight to the point with plenty of examples to help you start right away.
B00005R8GU|5.0|The greats such as Otis Spann, Paul Butterfield, and Buddy Miles, who join \\"papa\\" Muddy Waters on this album make for some blues in the best tradition. I love jammin' with it on my harmonica. This became my favorite Muddy Waters album after the first time I listened to it. I think you will too.
B000N3T0DW|1.0|Penelope Cruz was wonderful.  We loved all the women in the movie.  And her flamenco singing was stirring.
B000EULJLU|5.0|If you missed TOOL in the last decade, they are back and just as good as ever. Worth every Penny if you are a Metal Head.
0060776757|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my boyfriend.  He hasn't stopped talking about it and continuously quotes facts about U2 that he's read in the book whenever we're together.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I wouldn't have known about the book if it wasn't reccommended in the \\"if you liked this, you might also like that\\" section when I purchased a U2 CD.  Thanks!
B00005ATQF|5.0|Having gone through Marine Corps boot camp, I'd have to say this movie pretty accurately covers the emotional shock of the whole experience.  It's actually a a cult classic amongst Marines because it reminds us of the \\"hell\\" of our indoctrination to the Corps.  That indoctrination in turn has made the Marine community an extremely cohesive brotherhood that lasts well past our time in the Corps.  In fact, would any other Marines agree that this was actually a pretty light depiction of the mental stimulation that is boot camp?   <br /> <br />On a side note.  If you think that Lee Ermey was funny in his dark and nasty quips at the recruits, think of 3 drill instructors doing it at the same time.  It's like the most hilarious comedy routine that you have ever seen with a dark twist; you laugh--you lose.  Hilarity ensues.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Great to hear some new work form Dio and the boys from Sabbath. I only hope they hold it together long enough to do more!
0316789720|4.0|Ed Emberley's drawing books are great.  Step by step easy instructions you can follow to draw almost anything!<br /><br />I enjoyed these as a kid and now my step-daughter enjoys them too!
B00005JPGO|4.0|Great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see what the diamond trade really has happening.
B000002AGN|5.0|I just absolutely love this CD  The song Time Out is one of my favorites.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Very funny and worth watching.  Jack Black makes some of this happen so much in the movie. <br /> <br />
B000021Y7X|5.0|i'm only casually into the talking heads, but i really enjoyed this movie!<br /><br />i put it on while cleaning my room -- great music, perfect tempo
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Intense and worth spending the time watching.  If this is what is to become of mankind we had better be prepared.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|A world where women are no longer giving birth. A world in turmoil. A world that will end for mankind in less than 80 years.<br /><br />A lot of war still going on in the world in this movie and it's sad. You'd think at the end of times, man would come together to figure out a cure for what is wrong. Or maybe just not die mad, but peaceful. That part was kinda sad for me. You can just look at most of the people and just see in their faces that the end is near. Why people were even working anymore was a surprise to me.<br /><br />Theo (Clive Owen) unexpectedy gets mixed up in a series of events starting off with a lost love that ends up with him meeting a pregnant girl that he will soon have to get out of the place that he lives to a more peaceful area of the world, and hopefully save mankind.<br /><br />I thought the whole story was pretty well done in the movie. It definitely kept my attention throughout the movie. The pace of the movie seemed very fast once the action starts to pick up.<br /><br />The camera work in the movie was phenomenal. The action scenes were so well choreographed it seemed real. The best part about the movie in my opion was the action scenes. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (the director) made every action scene without taking one cut which made it all look so damn real. The last big action scene had to be about 15-20 minutes long with no cuts. I was just in awe with how well it was done.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about the movie was the ending, and it wasnt even that bad, it was just not how I would've ended it. Also some parts of the story seemed to have been thrown in for filler. Other than that though...great movie.
B000001F45|4.0|This is the first album that I have ever bought, so it reminds me lots of memories from the past...how time pass too quickly ! <br />This cd is a classic album for Uriah Heep, the band was at its peak ! <br />All songs are magical with some special mention for \\"Echoes in the dark\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Tales\\" and the title tracks. \\"The Magician's Birthday\\", these are favorite of mine.
0805047905|5.0|she never gets tired of it, she is 7M old and keep asking for us to read it to her over and over for the past 2 month.<br />She loves it  when we make the animal sounds for each animal.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|This is a great follow up to the first CD, however if you're thinking this is a complete CD collection of their latest TV broadcast performance - think again. Several songs are missing as well as the music that was performed from their first CD and TV special. Still good but less lively then the first CD and disappointing that some of the livelier crowd pleasing tunes were omitted.
0679422714|4.0|My first attraction to this book was the author, because I read \\"Wild Swans,\\" which she wrote in the early nineties.  This book she co-wrote with her husband, a professional editor.  I believe he assisted her on \\"Wild Swans,\\" too, but his role in the writing of this book seems to be more prominent.  Not sure what that means, but the contribution is noticeable.  This book is well written and very readable.<br /><br />I can't remember when I have been so conflicted about a book I have read.  And it seems I am not the only one.  This book has been alternately praised and cursed since it arrived on the scene.  Having read the book now, and worked through the frustration I have felt with the brazen assumptions and questionable documentation, I still have to say that I think it is worth reading.  I say that because, although the book is seriously flawed, and certainly not as \\"new,\\" or groundbreaking as it's title seems to claim, it does address questions in it's own flawed way, that demand to be answered.<br /><br />\\"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,\\" and Jung Chung is nothing if not angry.  Mao's policies deeply hurt her family, and she is determined to get even. This anger, more than any other factor, is the root of this book's inadequacies--inadequacies that overshadow every observation, every conjecture (and boy there are lots of them!), every interview.  The bottom line is that this book is tough to evaluate, because it contains so much material that is of questionable origin, obviously designed to support conclusions that are sharply hampered by a poor knowledge of the actual history.  According to Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, they listed as an interviewee a close personal friend of his who told him that, in fact, she declined to be interviewed.  In this sense, the book is aptly named.  In ordinary parlance, a book of this kind would be called the \\"Untold Story.\\" In choosing an unusual name like \\"The Unknown Story,\\" the authors have, no doubt unwittingly, identified what is the primary weakness of this book.  In other words, if the great body of stuff that is thought to be true about Mao were to be divided between that which can be clearly documented, and is known for sure to be true, and that which is largely conjecture or innuendo (gossip, in other words), this book would be the repository of the latter.<br /><br />But I need to get back to the history problem.  This book is not written by people who really know the history, and build the story of Mao into that contextual background.  Rather, it is written by people who quite obviously knew very little of the basic historical context before they started writing the book, and built the history by looking for \\"facts\\" that supported the conclusions they had started with, and ignoring those which militated against those assumptions.  An example might be helpful here:<br /><br />Regarding the shelling of Quemoy (Jinmen Dao) and Matsu, Chang and Halliday refer to Quemoy at least twice as the \\"springboard\\" or \\"jumping off point to Taiwan.\\"  They conclude that Mao must have known he could never take Taiwan , so he must have had an ulterior motive for shelling Quemoy and Matsu, which was to manipulate the Russians into giving him the nuclear weapons he craved.  But Chang and Halliday have the story exactly backwards.  In fact, Quemoy was not a springboard for China to go to Taiwan; it was a springboard for Chiang Kai-shek to retake the mainland.  How they could have missed this is a mystery.  Even if we forgive them their complete ignorance of the history surrounding this event, simple geography should have set them straight.  If you cannot travel to Xiamen (which, by the way, is a beautiful city), go to Google Earth and take a look at it from the air.  Xiamen is mislabeled on the map (Google has it situated on Gulangyu), but Quemoy (Jinmen Dao) is labeled correctly, and has a very distinctive shape.  It sits right in the middle of Xiamen Bay, and is not anywhere near Taiwan.  Chang and Halliday's suggestion that this was a springboard for the Chinese to take Taiwan is absurd, and betrays a surprising lack of awareness of the known history.  Here is the story they should have told:<br /><br />In August of 1954, Chiang Kai-shek moved 58,000 troops to Jinmen Dao in preparation for retaking the mainland.  He also moved 15,000 troops to Matsu (further to the north).  China responded with a massive artillery bombardment of the islands.  U.S.  President Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons in defense of the Nationalist government on Taiwan, and Mao backed off.  This is not to suggest that Mao was not interested in \\"liberating\\" Taiwan, but to refute the idea that His shelling of Quemoy and Matsu was completely without provocation, and must, therefore, have masked some other motive.<br /><br />But there is a larger problem with Jung Chang's portrayal of Mao as the sole source of everything bad that happened to China.  Generally, in my study of history, I try to operate from the basic rule that only God gets to be God, and only Satan gets to be Satan.  To make anyone else God is to completely distort that person's actual contribution to history.  To make anyone else Satan is to exonerate a whole host of guilty people.  To a just man, clearing the guilty must be as onerous as punishing the innocent.<br /><br />Look, Mao did a lot of really bad things.  And it is right and proper to assign blame to him for what he did.  But there were lots of injustices that were perpetrated against innocent people a long time before the Cultural Revolution.  Watchman Nee (Ni To-sheng), for example, was arrested in '50 or '51.  I use him as an example, because he is widely read among Christians in the West, and he spent the last 20 years of his life in prison because of his Christian faith.  He is only one among many whose arrests had no connection to the Anti-rightist campaign or the Cultural Revolution.  In other words, these human rights abuses were standard fare in the early days of \\"New China.\\"  To blame Mao for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution is appropriate, because whatever may be said about the \\"Gang of Four\\" (more on that later), Mao did start the Cultural Revolution, and nobody denies that.  But to transfer over to Mao the blame that is due Jung Chang's parents and their cohorts in the vast, diabolical system that devastated so many lives before they got their own comeuppance?  No.  This we cannot allow.  And what about Jung Chang herself?  She was a Red Guard.  Perhaps she would protest that she never personally tore down any temples.  In all the narratives I have read by former Red Guards, they all describe themselves as having been on the fringe of the movement, almost as if they were unwilling participants.  Jung Chang is no exception to this (read her book \\"Wild Swans\\").  But the fact remains that she voluntarily made herself part of the reckless rabble that destroyed this country.  There were decent kids during those days who refused to be part of the nonsense.  Jung Chang could have chosen to be one of them.  Instead, she chose to follow the crowd.  That was not Mao's decision.<br /><br />Now to the gang of four.  Chang and Halliday begin their chapter on Jiang Qing by saying that \\"she never originated policy, and she was always Mao's obedient servant.\\"  It's hard to read such nonsense without laughing.  Jiang Qing was sensitive to how far she could push the envelope, and she certainly paid the obligatory homage to her husband, especially before the media.  But she unquestionably had her own agenda, and pushed it with energy, much to Mao's consternation.  He publicly rebuked her on several occasions.  And she showed herself opposed to his agenda in key areas.<br /><br />Jiang Qing hated Zhou En-lai.  He knew this, of course, but was a master at maintaining an equilibrium that made him indispensable to Mao.  Zhou was certainly not blind to Jiang Qing's ambition.  Toward the end of theCultural Revolution, he confided to Sirin Phathanothai, daughter of the Thai diplomat, \\"We have a dowager empress on our hands.\\"<br /><br />Jiang Qing also despised Deng Xiao-ping, and tried very hard to destroy him.  She failed, because Mao needed Deng, and seemed, throughout the Cultural Revolution, to be determined to keep Deng available, but she certainly made life miserable for him, and was largely responsible for him being purged a second time.<br /><br />Too be sure, there are those in China who go to the extreme of suggesting that Jiang Qing was the prime mover behind the Cultural Revolution.  \\"It wasn't his fault,\\" one of them told me, referring to Mao.  No doubt Jiang Qing was a convenient scapegoat for those who could not come to terms with the fact that the father of their country attacked his own people.  But if it is absurd to suggest that Jiang Qing was the architect of the Cultural Revolution, it is just as absurd to suggest that she was merely doing Mao's bidding.<br /><br />Look, if you are in desperate need for someone to hate, you will love this book.  It will give you plenty of excuse to blame all that has gone wrong with China over the last half-century on this one man.  If you're a little creative, you might even be able to figure out how Mao is somehow to blame for whatever has gone wrong in your own life.  But this kind of thinking does not do service to history.  A history that whitewashes Mao's impact on the lives of millions of innocent people is nauseating.  But a history that puts all the blame on Mao and lets everyone else off the hook is also less than worthy of high regard.  Jesus said, \\"You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\\"  And if it's not the truth, it won't set you free, no matter how good it makes you feel. And for all of his weaknesses, Mao, after all, was the one chosen by history to build China into an independent country free from domination by foreign powers.  We may wonder at the wisdom of Providence, but we would all have to admit that no one before him was able to pull it off.<br /><br />So what, then, is the value of this book?  I believe it's primary attraction is that it is very personal.  Sometimes we have to use imperfect sources in our attempt to get at the truth.  I read the China Daily every day, because it gives useful insight into the people and places of China.  But I am not blind to the fact that it is regulated by the government, so it is not my only source of information about this country.<br /><br />Put yourself in the place of Jung Chang.  You are so angry you can't see straight, but you feel there is a story that needs to be told.  Should you recuse yourself because you can't possibly be objective, or should you go ahead and do your best.  This book is  a very personal, engaging story.  It is heavily encumbered by the lack of objectivity with which it was written.  But Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have employed archives from the old Soviet Union, the study of which needs to be expanded.  This book is a step in that direction, and raises questions that need to be debated.  Because of its highly personal nature and readable quality, it will probably be read much more by Chinese people than any other biography of Mao.  So it will serve to raise questions which might not otherwise have been discussed.  Perhaps it will even open the minds of the powers that be to the importance of openly discussing Mao's part in the history of this great country. When Mao stood on Tiananmen and said, \\"China has stood up!\\"  he was expressing the exultation of the masses at being finally independent.  Could any other leader have achieved this?  If this book encourages attempts to answer that and other questions raised, it will be, for all its weaknesses, a contribution to the ongoing study.hese human rights abuses were standard fare in the early days of \\"New China.\\"   To blame Mao for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution is appropriate, because whatever may be said about the \\"Gang of Four\\" (more on that later), Mao did start the Cultural Revolution, and nobody denies that.  But to transfer over to Mao the blame that is due Jung Chang's parents and their cohorts in the vast, diabolical system that devastated so many lives before they got their own comeuppance?  No.  This we cannot allow.  And what about Jung Chang herself?  She was a Red Guard.  Perhaps she would protest that she never personally tore down any temples.  In all the narratives I have read by former Red Guards, they all describe themselves as having been on the fringe of the movement, almost as if they were unwilling participants.  Jung Chang is no exception to this (read her book \\"Wild Swans\\").  But the fact remains that she voluntarily made herself part of the reckless rabble that destroyed this country.  There were decent kids during those days who refused to be part of the nonsense.  Jung Chang could have chosen to be one of them.  Instead, she chose to follow the crowd.

B000O174CM|4.0|I'm sick and tired of hearing people babble on about how the \\"Dreamgirls\\" movie is a \\"blatant ripoff\\" about Motown and the Supremes. If anyone who had the slightest bit of knowledge of the history of this Broadway musical, then they already KNEW what it was all about. Just what were you expecting when it was made into a film? If you were aware of the subject matter already, then you SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED TO SEE IT - PERIOD.<br /><br />The late Michael Bennett, who created the original Broadway production, said himself in 1981 that the musical was BASED on the Supremes story, but it was not necessarily the SAME story. I was fortunate enough to see the original stage production back in the day and being a fan of Motown music, I KEPT THAT FACT IN MIND. If you had allowed yourself to do the same, whether or not you had seen the Broadway musical, then you might have enjoyed the film a little bit more. The screenplay very much plays on the similarities between what really happened with Motown, and I admit it annoyed me to a small degree (especially the knockoff Jackson 5 group and the Beyonce-as-Deena montage - felt like I was watching \\"Mahogany\\"), because the Broadway production didn't do this.<br /><br />Deena's character was rewritten from being the bitchy Diana Ross-like lead singing diva in the Broadway production to being another innocent, sympathetic victim of Curtis' power plays - perhaps to not make Beyonce (who tried hard to channel Ross here) look like the bad guy to her fans. But I can't see how anyone could discount the outstanding performances of Eddie Murphy as a fading, womanizing, drug-using R&B star, Jimmy \\"Thunder\\" Early (who seems to be a composite character of James Brown, Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson) and Jennifer Hudson as the strongwilled and talented but wronged diva Effie White (whose character was based on original Supreme Florence Ballard) - they deserved every accolade they've received for their roles.<br /><br />This is clearly Eddie Murphy's finest role, and shows that he can also excel in drama as well as he does in comedy. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson came to the public's attention through the TV talent show, \\"American Idol\\" a couple of years back and she is excellent as Effie. Her rendition of \\"Dreamgirls'\\" signature song, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" is certain to make her as famous as the original Effie in the Broadway production, powerhouse vocalist Jennifer Holliday, made her.<br /><br />Anika Noni Rose was also a highlight, and I just loved her bubbly enthusiasm in the role of Lorrell. It was good to see Danny Glover on screen again, and Keith Robinson as C.C. White was a delight. Jamie Foxx (playing the villain in the role of Curtis Taylor, Jr.), and Beyonce (who really can't act - just because she's been cast in movies doesn't mean she has the skills) are just there - nothing really special in their performances and in all honesty, anyone else could have played their parts and we would not have been deprived of anything.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie, and yes, it has its flaws. But I personally don't give two hoots in hell what Berry Gordy, Jr., Smokey Robinson, and Diana Ross say. If they are so concerned with accuracy and really want folks to know the TRUE story of Motown, warts and all, perhaps they should all work on something that will set the record straight, once and for all, to counter what was presented in \\"Dreamgirls\\" - instead of whining \\"That's not how it was\\" and writing tired books that sugarcoat the whole experience. But it's a sure bet that a tell-all will never come to pass, because among other things, it means Gordy and his greediness would have to be revealed as the primary reasons why so many acts from Motown's golden years died in poverty.shows that he can also excel in drama as well as he does in comedy.

0374105235|4.0|This book was very interesting to read, however I didn't think it was written all that well. It would have been nice to have a chapter dealing with how things developed over the next few years of the authors life. I some how felt the book incomplete at the end and had lots of unanswered questions. Finally, it probably needed to be more graphic as it didn't convey the horrors of war in a manner so compelling as to spur me to take action which a book of this nature might want to do since the US basically looks the other way concerning the issues involved here (re: Darfur).

Unfortunately by the time I bought the album, I was too cheap to buy the 8 track of it or I would have the Golden Sombrero!  It is every bit as dynamic, clean, soulful and powerful as back in the '70's when I first heard my college roommate's album.  Dewar's voice is still great and Trower still rocks like nearly nobody else.
0618477942|5.0|Alison Bechdel is a very well read, literary author. Meaning, I have to look up some of her words in the dictionary. She also references great books in literature and events in political history. I have read and supremely enjoyed every book she has authored, so it was a sincere gift to read this eloquent and entertaining memoir of her life. She mananges to blend some deeply intimate and tragic events with her witty and spontaneous humor. All of her fans and anyone new to her craft will most certainly enjoy and be moved by this treasure of a book, no matter your sexual preference or if you have one at all! I highly recommend not having one, and I highly recommend this book, to all genders.

This work is genius in simplicity. Lessons of the value of life and life-process are clear. The book may be among the most important you ever pick up. And when you're finished, pick up Coelho's, The Valkyries, too.

0517548232|5.0|The lesson of Economics in One Lesson is that any interference in economic systems that helps one group of people always ends up taking something away from another group of people. The author believes that the less interference in economic systems there is the better the economic system runs. He is against make work schemes, excessive taxes, public works, tariffs, a minimum wage, and unions. He is even critical of Social Security. This book was written originally in 1946 so there is no talk of the issue of Globalization and the numbers used are smaller than we are accustomed to, but otherwise it talks about timeless issues. I think it is important to remember that there are other ways of thinking about economics that are not so extreme in their opposition to public works, unions and a minimum wage. I also think that, although the market does correct itself without intervention and therefore the overall arguments of the author are correct, wages, for example, would be a lot lower if we did not have a minimum wage. Many minimum wage jobs require no skills and therefore there are lots of people to fill them so there is no competition for labor and therefore no incentive to offer higher wages. This book left me wanting to read more about economics, not just for more of the author's point of view, but also for opposing points of view.

0451191153|5.0|I cannot stress how much this novel, reading it 10 years ago has changed my life. I cannot by any means explain how Howard Roark is my ultimate idol for achieving my dreams, keeping my integrity, and have a better understanding about us humans. <br /> <br />By far, no one needs to praise this masterpiece more. It's a classic with words, pages, and sentences that will definatly rattlesnake forever in one's mind. What is a man's purpose? What's the difference between selfishness and will? What is objectivism or universalism? Why would you stay original in your endeavors and believe in them no matter what? <br /> <br />My favorite part is when Roark brings down the designs that they have changed. Call me idialistic but what if Howard Roark would emmerge from each one of us? What if we never supplicate to a social programming of what should and what shouldn't be? Believe this is a charchter that if you always remember, it coudl change a couple of decisions in your life for the better. <br /> <br />I know it's a ficticious charcter, but it jumps out of the pages. <br /> <br /> Imaginary, intellectual, and so fabulously written it makes me think it is a spell book of magic hymn to a better mankind. This is a long book, that usually most writers don't know how to make it interesting and keep it in tempo. But Ayn Rand writes so beautifully with a consistency you can't deny that at the end you still want to read more. <br /> <br /> Also every chracter is drawn perfectly. Every Charachter even Peter Keating, Elsworth Toothy, is just so believable and with reasonning logic and motive of their own.   <br /> <br /> Also I really like the strange love relationship between Roark and Dominique. To many this relationship, or affair, whatever you want to call it, is out of the ordinary and not believable and sometimes unethical to some people. But this a side love story with reality biting at it. <br /> <br /> That's Ayn Rand's magic! <br /> <br /> The philosophy she imposes might seem radical and counter-intuitive in the beginning. If you don't read carefully you might get confused of why the charcters act this way. It needs time to shift your thinking to one of the greatest philosophies of history.  <br /> <br /> Ayn Rand is a great and detailed obsever of the human beahviour, analyser at best, on-purpose, and accepts it that we are paradoxically a conflict-based bein. We swim betwen between our real needs and wants and those social ideas bestowed on us. <br /> <br /> I don't want to sound poetic or as if i try to be writer ... read this book and buy some other copies for your grand children ... <br /> <br /> Awsome! <br /> <br /> [[ASIN:0452011876 Atlas Shrugged]] Atlas Shruged is as good and at moments even better.  <br /> <br /> [[ASIN:1419652583 The Human Effect]] is also a novel intensivley interested in human paradoxical behaviour explained chracters who are architechts as well. Only beware it is a phsycological hunting horror in genre with a mystery plotline. <br /> <br /> [[ASIN:0684833395 Catch-22]] is my ultimate human condition book that on contrary of Rand, this one makes me laugh at the ideas imposed on our lives as individuals. One great book! A classic of course. A catch will alwys remain with you for life. <br /> <br /> Reviewed by PJ

B000N6TX1I|5.0|I love, love, love this film.  I love the performances (Owen, Moore, Caine, etc., everyone marvelous, the story and the music, both rock and classical (John Taverner, Modern wrote the latter).  However, I hesitate to recommend it.  It isn't for the faint hearted.  It is a kind of \\"Matrix\\" or \\"Dark City\\" without the fantasy.  The idea that the world might really come to this point someday is sobering.  Margaret Underwood already wrote of a world where pregnancy is a miracle in her \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\".  However, her book centered on an well kept internal situation, and it has never been well done on film.  This story widens the scene to postapocryphalic (?) England where the things we live with are twisted and dirtied.  It has trusted friends who suddenly have their own shocking agendas; it has sacrifice by friends and family and it has hope for the future.  It has scenes where the cry of new baby quiets a war but also brings out the worst in people. <br /> <br />Again, this is not for the faint hearted, but it might be a natural next step in our world.  I hope not; I dearly hope this is not the world I am leaving to my children and grandchildren.  However, if it is, I do believe in miracles and do have hope for the future.  See this film for your own edification but do so with care.

If you are new to Don Coscarelli's movies I hope this will encourage you to check out the sequels to Phantasm and of course the mighty Bubba-Hotep! (Long live the king!) The movie has a great balance of drama and good old 70's cheese (not over the top in my opinion....just enough to make you sit back and smile). After all when was the last time an aging ice cream vendor with pattern baldness was a hero!!? All kidding aside though, as a pretty avid horror movie junkie, and a fan that looks for really good horror films that continue to stand the test of time....this is one of them!
B000JJRIP2|5.0|Yes, I must Admit I did buy it for the so Called Millennium Concert. I am Happy that they did release some of that concert: anyone with tapes of that concert knows they could quite easily have done two discs of the Millennium concert, since the entire show was fully recorded, so why only one song from Ace, and no solo? Anyway, I am happy for the Bits they gave on disc.<br />The Alive 1,2 and 3 are great discs, sounding superb in 5.1 systems; much improved. I must admit I did think that Gene ( or Someone, :-) redid the Bass work for the Live 1 and 2, but I guess with a Remaster that fixes all sounds.<br />Each of the discs reprises the Packaging of the original albums, as well as the disc bed, which has a reprise of the cover shots. The Booklet tops the memorable tour of the KISS  past.<br />It really does bring home that KISS has material that is better than Good. Ace has said that the Reunion tour was DAT recorded. With a great selection of other songs, why can't they release more. Anyways, I more than Love what I got. Its a Great Buy, and I am more than happy with the great sound<br />  It should be interesting to see if the  remasters get \\"Re-Mastered\\" as in after DESTROYER resurrected, will there be more items re-done, like the 4 disc set which has the packing case. Should be great to see if this collection is put into 5.1, since it is do-able. but time and money will tell.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This is my first movie review for Amazon, other than my irreverent take on \\"The Ten Commandments\\", which I titled \\"Hangin' With Jethro\\". The DVD release of \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" (unlike the movie theatre counterpart) gives away the \\"identity\\" of the city. But don't worry - I won't tell.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is more than competent (and very tall) as Harold Crick, the IRS Auditor. Since you've probably already seen the trailers on TV, or some stills online, it won't spoil anything for you if I say that the guitar stuff goes a bit too far for me, but it does work wonders for him.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is great (and noticeably short next to WF) as Prof. Hilbert, the \\"I'm much too busy for this\\" University Literature Professor. He transfers lots of coffee around between various alembic vessels.  Best Line: \\"Well, it's been a very revealing 10 seconds\\" in response to HC saying \\"10 seconds ago you didn't have any time for me\\".<br /><br />Emma Thompson is brilliant as Karen Eiffel, the towering writer of tragic fiction, unheard from and quite untraceable for the past 10 years. She gets rather attractive the way you want her to be near the end, when she can't make up her mind and approaches the professor.  Best Line: \\"I don't *need* nicotine patches - I've got cigarettes!\\"<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite precocious as Ms. Pascal, the boisterous baker and the subject of HC's attentions, professional and otherwise. Didn't know about her - I'll definitely have to look for more.  Best Line: \\"But Harold, the whole *point* is to swindle the government!\\"<br /><br />Queen Latifah plays it straight and serious (another dramatic first for this film) as Penny Escher, the \\"assistant\\" from Eiffel's publishing house, prompting the troubled writer to wrap things up asap. I'd like to see her take on more roles like this one. Best Line: \\"So do you always come up with your best ideas outside in the pouring rain?\\"<br /><br />Tom Hulce (from \\"Amadeus\\" and \\"Animal House\\") is supposedly in here somewhere - does anyone know where? Maybe his looks have changed more than mine have over the last 20 years. I couldn't figure out which part he played.  Best Line: I have no idea.<br /><br />Despite everything you may have heard, STF is *not* LOL comedy. I thought it was very enticing, and chuckled in many different ways in many different places, but it's probably not going to have you rolling in the aisles. It may not be the greatest descriptor to use, but for lack of \\"different\\" words, I will just say that this is a very \\"different\\" kind of film story from your typical Hollywood dramedy screenplay. Having watched, I'm now rather interested in learning about other movies that pursue a similar \\"story-telling\\" tack. Any suggestions? (\\"The Truman Show\\", yes, sinister.)<br /><br />Amazon reader/buyers will recognize themselves somewhere in \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\", that's my guess, and they just might find it fun to watch over again or to share with someone who hasn't seen it yet just to watch *them* for *their* reactions. Amazon reader/buyers are also notoriously outspoken individuals (isn't that the whole idea?) - so somebody please tell me if I've over-stepped my responsible bounds with this review. I intentionally didn't read any of the other 160 reviews in an attempt to keep mine original and not inadvertently \\"lift\\" anyone else's thoughts. But Imc, writing about music is much easier for me, where giving away sub-plot-lines is pretty much de rigueur. (My title line is a reference to Thelonious Monk's cynical assessment of people who \\"write about music\\" for a living.) Hope you enjoy STF as much as I did.? Maybe his looks have changed more than mine have over the last 20 years. I couldn't figure out which part he played.  Best Line: I have no idea.    Despite everything you may have heard, STF is *not* LOL comedy. I thought it was very enticing, and chuckled in many different ways in many different places, but it's probably not going to have you rolling in the aisles.

B000KJU1HI|5.0|What can he say? Where else can he go? Any damn place he wants to. This is great stuff showing exactly why Bob Dylan stands well above any other popular culture figure of the 20th century.
B0000DZ3DR|5.0|This album is a revelation as it not only reassures us of the brilliance of Gene Clark but also showcases the talent of the wonderful Carla Olsen. This is a must have album for serious music lovers.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I love Michael Buble and own every song he's put out... so I thought something must be defective with the CD when I played the title song.  But it seems that it's not the disk but Michael himself.  I don't understand the shlurring and the lithping - Was this intentional??? If it was, I don't think it adds anything whatsoever. If it wasn't... were the producers/editors asleep at the mixer??  I'm sad, because I don't think this CD collection is up to the high standards I've come to expect from Buble.  I'll listen online first before I buy his next one...
0783240287|5.0|This is the best version of Joseph ever. The DVD is almost as great as the live performances!
0307346609|5.0|Although WORLD WAR Z is, without a doubt, fiction, it's also so much more than that. You can call it a satire; what you can't call it is totally made up story that could never happen in the real world.<br /><br />Told in an interview style, WORLD WAR Z is the story of the Zombie War that nearly decimated Earth. From the Great Panic to VA Day, every possible voice is heard from--politicians, soldiers, divers, dissidents, deserters, and the everyday, average Joe who found himself fighting for his life and way of existence in the face of the undead.<br /><br />Max Brooks has a very unique writing style, a very loud \\"voice\\" that draws you into his story from page one and never lets go. Although there's never been an actual war against an insurgent tide of undead, there have been plenty of wars and squirmishes throughout history that the author had to draw from. From the Vietnam and Korean wars, from World War I & II and the fight against Hitler, from Desert Storm to the current fight against terrorism in Iraq, Mr. Brooks has managed to pull the best--and worst--from everyone involved and use it in his fictional account.<br /><br />There's no doubt that WORLD WAR Z is an amazing, addictive, wonderful read. It's also emotional, disturbing, and thought-provoking. Although I may not worry, per se, about an upcoming fight against zombies, I do worry about the world that my children, and future grandchildren, will be left to inhabit after I'm gone. In that respect, this story is frightening. It's scary to think that the world, whether it be the mighty democracy of the United States or the iron fist of Russia or China, would not be prepared to defend themselves against a global attack from something outside of their human enemies.<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Brooks for such a great read. Fiction or satire, pure speculation or hard fact, WORLD WAR Z is one book you don't want to miss.
1400031001|5.0|It is surprising how comparatively little there is written by English authors about the generation who saw the two world wars and the collapse of the Empire, considering the huge interest of their experience to understand the UK as it is now and the astounding number of fascinating individuals that period gave to them. It might be a problem of lack of historical perspective. At any rate, this book is starting to fill this gap.<br /><br />William Boyd has accomplished what seems to me a considerable feat. His novel is considerably believable and highly entertaining. Don't be deluded by its diary form, Mr. Boyd manages to nest in that style different genres (action, crime, thriller, historical speculation), which grab the reader's attention from first page to last.<br /><br />His research seems very accurate and his stand is fairly neutral(as far as I know, for instance for the parts referred to Spain and the Spanish War) which also no small accomplishment.<br /><br />I most enjoyed the portraits of celebrities of the time (Virginia Wolf, the Duke of Windsor, Pablo Picasso, Evelyn Vaughan, etc.),which are portrayed in a subjective light, with a strong accent on their personalities, about which the author takes a bold and well informed stance.<br /><br />The book doesn't loose it's rhythm at any moment. The sturdiest novel of him I have yet read (which is a list made only of Armadillo, A Good Man in Africa and this one, though)
0743496728|5.0|I always find it hard to read books dealing with school shootings, since I am the mother of two school-aged children. NINETEEN MINUTES, however, is an emotional story that should be required reading for teens, along with their watching of the movie [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)]].<br /><br />Reading this story of a bullied teen who finally has enough and takes out his anger on his high school is enlightening, and, at times, hard to read. I found it very easy to identify with many of the characters in the book: not just with the shooter, but with the judge's daughter, who wants only to fit in and be popular, and the jocks, who don't know how to be anything but what they are.<br /><br />NINETEEN MINUTES is a great book. I can honestly say I enjoyed it, even while crying my way through several passages. Read it -- whether a teen or the parent of a teenager, and find out what REALLY happens in high schools around the US -- and what could be happening, quite possibly, in your own hometown.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|I agree with many other reviewers that the movie is too long. At just over two hours, the same film could have been made in about 90 minutes. However, I disagree that there was no \\"emotion\\" in this film.<br /><br />Many have said they want the \\"real\\" story of the World Trade Center. They want to see jets exploding into buidings, they want to see people jumping to their deaths from sixty stories up, they want to see the towers collapsing as thousands of people scream in horror.<br /><br />Me? I already saw that story, on the news the day of 9/11 and the weeks that followed. I don't need to see it again.<br /><br />What WORLD TRADE CENTER is is a story of courage, strength, and the desire to help your fellow man. What those two Port Authority policemen went through is a tribute to everyone who died on 9/11. The spirit of working together, of working to stay alive, is one we can all do well to listen to.<br /><br />Sure, the movie could have been shorter. Yes, it's \\"just\\" about two men who spent hours trapped under the rubble of a collapsed tower. Yes, there are scenes of their \\"bawling\\" wives. There is also the news that these officers survived, endured unimaginable pain through countless operations, and emerged as heroes on a day that surely needed them.<br /><br />That was good enough for me.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I was a little leary of purchasing this box set.  There wasn't much info about it when I bought it, but I am really happy with it!  It was just what I was looking for!
B000MV9026|4.0|Personally, my children and I all enjoyed watching HAPPY FEET. Watching Mumble learn to be himself during his quest to make the world a better place was a great moral lesson; the music is fun and fresh; the supporting characters are a blast. Of course, as always, there will be those with \\"moral issues\\" concerning the movie, as there always are. For my family, though, this was two-hours well spent.
0340822783|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was intelligent, had some interesting things to say, the approach was very fresh, and one section of it had me laughing outloud, and I continued laughing about it later while I was thinking about it. I think it deserves 4.5 stars, but seeing as I can't give it that many, I will work on the glass half full principle.
0743289412|3.0|So many others have given an outline of Stephen King's newest release, but I just wanted to leave a few comments. This isn't a typical King book. I'm not saying it's bad, just different. It also takes awhile to get into the action, but once there the story is quite satisfying. As many have said, this is as much (if not more) a love story than a horror novel. The similarities between King's fictional characters and real life are remarkable (I'm guessing he planned it that way.) Overall, this is a book for the ultimate King fan. If you've never read Stephen King, though, I wouldn't recommend LISEY'S STORY as a place to start, since it's so divergent from what he normally writes.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Some movies keep their magic over time and this is one of them. Disney animation coupled with a heartfelt story makes for excellent viewing time and time again.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Season two, at least for me, moved soooooo slowly! I'm glad I waited and watched the entire season on DVD; I would have gone insane only watching one episode a week! As it was, my husband and I had to watch three or four episodes at a time to even feel like something had happened.<br /><br />And yes, strange things continued to happen. Some deaths, the Tailies meeting up with our regulars on the beach, a pregnancy, another healing, and some strange dealings with the Others.<br /><br />In the end, though, we're left with even more questions than we were left with at the end of Season one:<br /><br />Did Michael and Walt really escape the Island, and will they be rescued?<br /><br />What happened to Locke, Desmond, and Mr. Ecko? Did the Hatch really explode?<br /><br />Does Hurley make it back to camp to warn his people not to hunt the Others?<br /><br />What will the Others, seemingly led by \\"Henry,\\" do with Jack, Sawyer, and Kate now that they have them?<br /><br />What happened to Sayid, Jin, and Sun aboard the boat?<br /><br />Yes, I'm still LOST--lost in an ocean of clues that still don't seem to have any really answers.<br /><br />I guess I'll just have to wait and watch Season three on DVD when it comes out in late 2007.
B000NA77YO|5.0|This album is the one that all the fans have wanted for a long time. Although this could have easily been a double or triple set, it at least has REMASTERS of the best old songs. Then to see this current tour and see them all performed LIVE is a wish come true. Well worth getting especially with the 3 new songs included.
B00005OM5L|5.0|excellent sound , great solos . shot the sheriff is a standout, with gadd in top form keepin it all together as usual.His tom work and soul in wonderful tonight is worth the price alone.
B00003CXBK|5.0|My family LOVES this movie.  It is \\"One of Roger Ebert's top 10\\" for a reason.  The cast is great, the story is moving and the animation is breathtaking.  The really cool thing about this DVD is you can watch it in English or in Japanese with English subtitles.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This movie brought the story back to life, whereas other interpretations have paled in comparison to the book. This is worth your money and time. See it and you won't be disappointed!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I mean, I'll always buy a Rush album, I guess, just out of loyalty to my own youth as much as to the band itself. But this CD is as squashed as Vapor Trails was, without being quite as musically compelling (One Little Victory? Genius I tell you.) Fire the limiter-happy mastering engineers, and write some more cool songs.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film is an objective, logical presentation of the scientific fact of global warming.  The historical data graphs showing the greatly increased rate of warming, are really alarming. No one who views this data could  possibly deny the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br />The tragedy is that those who most need to view this film, will be the least likely to see it.  They just don't want to hear it.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Although nothing can compare to seeing this wonderful movie for the 1st time in a theater - having this DVD has rekindled some great memories. What a great movie!
B000MNP2KS|5.0|This is a great film!! I love James Bond films but they were losing their edge. Well, Daniel Craig is the sharpest Bond since Sean Connery. He is sexy, sexy, sexy!!!! I loved this film so much I ordered the DVD and the PSP copies. Get for your own collection.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Kudos to Kenny Wayne Shepard for taking on a project like this. He treats the subject and the performers with huge (and well-deserved) respect, and they deliver the goods. This is an amazing piece for blues fans, and a great eye-opener for young folks.
0446677450|1.0|I have bought this book for more than one month, but I have gotten it. Why?
B000MNP2KI|2.0|this is the only bond movie I have not watched twice <br />there is no style and where did they find the so called <br />leading lady,she has no appeal at all,the supporting  <br />ladies were much more attractive
B00007KWHG|4.0|I bought this to get the exquisite ballad \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\".  I hope it was properly honored when it was new, because everything about it is flawless: the song, the vocal, the production.  As for the rest of the CD, I was surprised to find myself enjoying it very much.  The songs from the early days (\\"Sherry\\", \\"Walk Like A Man\\", \\"Rag Doll\\") are excellent and brought back a lot of memories.  In the mid-60's, I was too preoccupied with The Beatles and The Stones and Bob Dylan to pay much attention to the Four Seasons.  I now see that several of their songs from that period were very good also:  \\"Let's Hang On\\", \\"Opus 17\\" and \\"C'Mon Marianne\\", to name a few.  But I also have to admit that I don't like the last 4 tracks, all from the Disco/Grease period.  Of the 4, \\"Who Loves You\\" is the only one I find tolerable.  On the whole, though, I think this is a pretty complete collection, and I imagine that most people probably don't dislike those last 4 songs as I do, so this CD would probably please anyone who wants the best of Frankie Valli and those other New Jersey boys.
B000002VRZ|4.0|For those of you who aren't old enough to remember, the Outlaws were arguably more popular than Lynyrd Skynrd in the heydey of southern rock (1975 - 1980).   Skynyrd's unfortunate demise led to them being canonized, though they certainly had several wonderful songs to justify it. <br /> <br />The Outlaws' first 3 Albums (Self-titled, Lady In Waiting, Hurry Sundown) were amazing LP's and this \\"Best of\\" CD captures most of their high notes.  Its missing a few great tunes (Holiday from Hurry Sundown immediately comes to mind) but overall is a good survey of their music. <br /> <br />The quality of their music tailed off quickly after Hurry Sundown -- partially due to Henry Paul leaving, but probably due to burnout on several levels.  Billy Jones was an amazing guitarist with a unique voice, on par with Neil Young.  Its too bad he wasn't with us longer.   <br /> <br />These guys were the 'metal band' of the Southern Rock area, so if you enjoy loud guitars and Skynrd-esque music, this CD is for you.
B00079ZACM|3.0|A fairly good version, although rather stilted in execution. The best of the remakes is the Alexander Korda production starring Anthony Steele and re-titled, \\"Storm Over the Nile\\", which, unfortunately, is not available. RH
0060005696|4.0|I thought this book was most excellent.  I took my time reading it but it still went fast.  The opening about choosing jeans at the GAP really struck a chord with me.  I have had the same dilemma and therefore I only buy two pairs of jeans every 2-3 years.  It's confusing.  On a business sense this has helped me with providing excellent customer care with AUDIN Web Design.  The sense of past loss versus future loss/gains really helped me in my business.  I am able to create a pricing model that is able to help my business as well make the customer feel comfortable.,  If you are a business owner, I suggest you take a look at this book.  I've also used this book to evaluate my personal life.  Have you been holding onto something because of some (ancient) intrinsic value?  This book helped me realized that I have a lot of things that will cost me more in the long run than it would if I just tossed it out.  That's the past loss.
B000LE1GVW|1.0|I had hoped that the whole album would be good but the only song that I liked was New Shoes. <br />The rest of the cd was poor at best
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in an American History Class as a teenager.  I still love it.  It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again without getting tired of it.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I was wowed by the eponymous release of Brandi Carlile's first album and this equally-rewarding sophomore production dodges the jinx, establishing Brandi as a rising star among contemporary female singers.  The title song, \\"The Story,\\" shows this girl next door's winsome voice at its best as she shows her range as well as her charm.  At times plaintive, at times gritty, her voice soars, breaks, and changes pitch seamlessly.  It IS the story of this CD.<br /><br />Other strong pieces from Brandi include \\"Late Morning Lullaby,\\" \\"Losing Heart,\\" \\"Until I Die,\\" and \\"Shadow on the Wall.\\"  Most interesting is how Brandi crosses the genres.  There are traces of folk, whiffs of country, beats of pop, and undertones of the blues.  Both THE STORY and her debut CD, BRANDI CARLILE, are equally accessible and worthwhile for those new to her work.<br /><br />Her music is great company both in the mellow hours of the morning (with your coffee) and in the pensive hours of the evening (with your wine).  Highly recommended -- End of Story.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I've always enjoyed James Bond movies but wouldn't call myself a huge fan, that is until this film.  Daniel Craig is superb.  The movie has just the right mix of action and romance with a more believable plot than many of the other Bond films. I truly can't image anyone not finding this movie entertaining.  Can't wait until the next installment of this franchise hits the screen!
B00005JO20|5.0|Thank you for your prompt service.  You made it very easy to order this product online.  The movie was great.  I enjoy doing business with Amazon and will continue to do so.  Again, thank you for your service.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I returned to Rush with the awesome sounds of their last album of original material, Vapor Trails. I left the band, except for occasional visits, after the album Signals. Although that album is excellent, it marked a departure in the band's style that I found far more commercial and less interesting.<br /><br />All that intro to say that Snakes and Arrows is powerful from the get-go and, like Vapor Trails, sounds exactly as the band who created 2112 and Moving Pictures more than a quarter century earlier should sound. It IS a five star album, stacking up just fine to anything like it that is presently being produced. It's distinctiveness from Vapor Trails tells me that this is a band very much still in the harness of creativity, not resting on its laurels or basking too cozily in its past glory.<br /><br />Rush remains one of the finest sounding, most intellectually pleasing bands of this head banging genre! The writing goes deep, if ya care, and the music throbs, pounds and pulsates!<br /><br />See ya' at the bowl in July!
B000001EUL|4.0|a classic Scorpions album with the bonus addition of Rudalphs Fantabulous guitar brother Mike. A good extra guitar to replace Uli. This album is a must have for scorp fans.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have watched a number of adaptations of this classic novel and I would have to say this is the best I have seen.  The strength lies chiefly in the development of the relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  Most adaptations do not as fully depict the developing attraction between these two central characters.  The dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester is outstanding.  Also, Jane's time away from Thornfield with Saint James is portrayed more closely to the novel than in many adaptations. <br /> <br />The treatment of Jane's youth is rather cursory, but the message is conveyed.  The only other potential criticism might be that Mr. Rochester (Toby Stephens)is more attractive than what is depicted in the book, but the acting is superb so this is easily forgiven.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book.  It is so beautifully presented.  It follows the DVD very closely (exactly?).  It is a good read each night to set you in the right frame of mind for the next day.  There are lots of good tips on how to view life as it should be viewed - as a wonderful adventure - the book teaches you to be grateful and enrichens your life.
0446677450|5.0|Wonderful book to teach one the very basics about finance and the tax necessity of incorporation. Great seller.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I use to watch this movie as a little girl and I still enjoy it now as much as ever. I watch it with my friends and their kids. Definately a movie to be passed down!!
B0000073BG|5.0|I have been looking for this cd for a while. <br />I had the lp but haven't listened to it for years
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Great movie!! The dialogue was witty.  I especially loved the comparison between LA's luxury and warm weather and Surrey's country life and cold winter.  A must have!!!
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon have distinguished themselves as two of the best actors of their generation. And in this movie, they both seemed to do it at the same time, in the same scenes. This film had the courage to explore issues within issues with guts. For example: Who grieves for the victimizers family? After this triumph why Tim Robbins doesn't direct more often is a mystery. Without a doubt Dead Man Walking is absolutely one of the best cinematic collaborations ever made. BRAVO!
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|With their tongues placed firmly in their cheeks, the songwriters have captured the techno-silliness that was the 80's music scene.  I am a product of that music and I love the inside jokes that abound!!  I also enjoyed the skewering they give current pop music with the over-the-top sexual lyrics and pseudo-Buddhism that is so popular.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|didn't know much about Buddy Guy before I got this CD - it's full-tilt blues-rock and sweet melodies with great lyrics and vocals - Buddy Guy is truly amazing - Eric Clapton credits him with being the musician he emulated - can see why - catch him live too - at 71 he looks 20 YR younger and as absolutely phenomenal
B000N3SRRC|4.0|It's true, \\"Beale Street\\" finds Clutch taking a slightly different course than on \\"Robot Hive\\" or \\"Blast Tyrant.\\" It doesn't slam as much as those CDs, but it swings harder and oozes a bit more grease. That \\"Beale Street\\" is so far removed stylistically from much of the band's early material is more evidence of how great this band is. If there were any justice at all, Clutch would selling out stadiums, but that might preclude true fans from seeing them up close, in a club or as part of a tour like Sounds of the Underground (that's where I saw them; been a huge fan ever since).
B000O1799U|1.0|This movie gets one star because for all its hype and awards this movie was boring. The story was not all that interesting, the music was even less interesting. I don't what type of singing it is that Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson sing, but it has no melody and follows no beat, I would call commercial gospel. Nevertheless, it's a real turnoff and does not do any justice to the great music produced by Motown. Beyonce is just horrible and a fake. Can she ever make you believe she is playing anyone else but herself? Yeah, compared to her, Jennifer Hudson does seem like an academy award actress. Hudson has potential but isn't quite there yet. The accolades and awards where a little premature. I am not sure what criteria was applied to this movie to make everyone think it was so good, but it's not. Save your money and buy the Supremes Greatest Hits.
1596680199|5.0|This book is beautifully illustrated, covers a multitude of techniques, including ones not previously covered, and has very clear instructions.

B000002UDB|5.0|Great album. Haven't heard some of the songs in years. The album is shorter than I realized. On cd you can pick up nuances like the line \\"I'll stay until it's time to go\\" on Hello Goodbye. Get it.
0375831002|5.0|Beautiful and poignant.  This book will stay with me forever.  The only other thing I can compare it to for impact is the movie American Beauty which still haunts me to this day.  If this is a children's book, then children's literature is way better than adult literature.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This is a fun, original movie based (partly) on a true story. The entire ensemble of actors is superb. A stellar performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor leads the way. His performance here is so good it inspired me to search for other Chiwetel Ejiofor films (Red Dust and Dirty Pretty Things are two). When you purchase the DVD be sure to get the soundtrack on CD too. This is a feel GOOD movie. Enjoy!
B000M5AJQS|1.0|Wow, let me tell you how disappointed I was in this Academy Award honored film.  It is everything that is wrong with Hollywood today.  The actors are the Lefty cadre of Babylon.  You know them.  They're in every IMPORTANT film, Leo, Matt, Jack, Alec, and Uncle Marty, the inner circle of the KGB.  They rant off screen about poverty while unloading Hollywood gold into their vaults.  They rant about environmental waste and drive a fleet of limos. But stop me before I puke.  Can they act?  Sometimes, but in the awful Hollywood school of the soulless-on-acid, I wish they would shut up and study old Humphrey Bogart films.     Is this plot and the awful cop dialogue believable?  NOOOOOO!  And does that one love interest, Vera Farmiga, give you any skinny shivers at all?  No!  For a Harvard shrink, she comes off mousy and dumber than a brick. Who'd fall for her? Not me.    Don't waste your time or money.  Scorsese is toast.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've enjoyed Emmylou Harris's work for over 30 years.  I had never heard of Mark Knopfler until the night that I heard this CD playing at the local bookstore.  I walked back and asked, \\"Who's the guy singing with Emmylou?\\"  [I am sure there are equally benighted souls who heard it and wondered, \\"Who's the woman singing with Mark Knopfler?\\"] <br /> <br />Thanks to the wonders of the Internet, I learned that he'd done the soundtracks for two of my favorite movies, [[ASIN:B00005LOKQ The Princess Bride (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:6305558205 Local Hero]]. <br /> <br />Most of the songs on this CD are ones he wrote; his lyrics are wry and witty.  Their voices work well together.  This is a highly singable CD, and the woman you see on the freeway on your way to work, singing her lungs out?  That would be me, singing along.
0307346609|5.0|the best part about this book is that, in the modern setting, brooks explores all the social, economic, and geopolitical factors that would play into a crisis such as a worldwide zombie outbreak. it's truly telling about the time we live in
0060853980|5.0|This was absolutely amazing! I picked it up on the recommendation of a friend, and am so glad I did. This is the first book I've come across in years that I've actually sat down and read straight through in less than two days. I'll admit that some of the humour went a bit over my head, seeing as much of it was british, but that didn't keep me from enjoying it at all. A wonderful read!
1571200851|5.0|Just the special technique I was looking for.  Book is well illustrated, directions easy to follow.  Nice projects!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I am a big Phantom fan and have seen the live production several times and have the original cast soundtrack. Yes, I love the original cast but this movie version is still an incredible version! The leads are all talented and I absolutely love this Phantom! He's rugged and passionate and I think you will feel for him on a whole new level. With the film you can really see the Phantom's pain, love, and loneliness. It's also a beautiful film with additional music and scenes. It's a little bit different than the orignal libretto, but again, it still stands on its own as a wonderful POTO spectacle!

0765315246|1.0|Actually, the first chapter had a rather novel premise. A couple pages into the second chapter I threw the book into the trash. I will not stand for subliminally being preached to. Far, far too many references to religion and god. I wanted Sci-Fi not mythical fantasy. Caveat emptor.

1582701709|1.0|This book is a load of bull. It says over and over you can have whatever you want if you say it to yourself over and over. A phoney crap load and a 1/2.
0790733226|1.0|it was long, unengaging and frankly, the end was not creative in the slightest.  Don't know what else to tell you.
0790731479|5.0|I feel in love with this movie when it first came out, years later I am the parent and decided to puchase this movie so my children can enjoy it as well.<br /><br />My son loves this movie, Michael Keton does a wonderful job of portraying the off humor Beetlejuice, Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis does a great job of being the plain Jane/John couple who dies and have not crossed over. Outstanding job to Winona Ryder as Lydia, the misunderstood teen ager who no one appears to understand.<br /><br />I give this movie two thumbs up, one scene in particular that still cracks me up is when they brought back the couple, Alex's character begins to speak and his jaw falls off... not to forget the beloved scene when Beetlejuice is sitting next to the Witch Doctor and steals his number, the head shrinking scene is just too funny for words.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Once again, Stevie Nicks gives us her best. She always does because she doesn't know how to do anything less. This prolific singer/songwriter/poet, (I think of her as a poet), is truly amazing. I love the live versions of \\"Landslide\\" (my favorite Nicks song) and \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" with the Melbourne Symphony. <br /> <br />The videos are fantastic as well! Seeing the \\"Scarlet Version\\" of \\"Stand Back,\\" especially with Stevie's commentary was hilarious. I highly recommend watching them with her commentaries. She's great! I had never seen the video for \\"Whole Lotta Trouble\\" another one of my favorites and I was there when she filmed it in Houston, Texas that night. I got a real kick out of putting the video on slow track in the beginning and seeing myself. <br /> <br />If you are a Nicks fan, this is a \\"must have.\\" If you have never listened to Stevie Nicks before or don't even know who she is (hard to imagine), BUY IT. You will NOT be disappointed!!!
B000NJM4JS|5.0|Quite simply, outstanding!<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit, at 28, I'm a young Doors fan.  I grew up with kids in the late 80's and early 90's who worshipped the Doors, especially Jim, as their messiah, and I never got it.  I've known their hits, enjoyed them, and that's kinda where it stopped.  I didn't even own a Doors record (The Doors) until I was in college in '99... that's when I started to understand what was so great.  However, I never investigated further.<br /><br />This past year, at the end of '06, the Perceptions box set came out and I made it my mission to save and buy it, 'cause my old copy the The Doors sounded horrible.  Well, before I knew it, it was gone, but thank you Warner for atleast re-issuing it ASAP in a slimmed down, frill-less box.<br /><br />I now own the best box I've ever owned.  I've read all the reviews for the LTD version, from people saying it's a waste of money compared to previous Doors boxes (fools!), to the the 5.1 mixes being poor (fools again!), to everything being redundant (yeah, but between 2 formats, not on the same disc or anything).  Here's my opinion... this is AWESOME!  Seriously.  I haven't even touched the CD's yet.  The 5.1 high-res audio mixes are blowing my mind, not to mention, for me, the exposure to a whole slew of songs I've never heard before.  Sure, The Doors doesn't benefit much from 5.1, but the high-resolution is what makes it better than any other mix you've ever heard previously.  Starting at Strange Days you can start to hear clever use 5.1.  Never anything to be distracting, but maybe just some good ambience, or background vocals actually being in the back.  The real fun starts at Waiting For The Sun and Soft Parade.  Those two, in 5.1 high-res are leaving me breathless.  I carry on rediculously to my girlfriend about the clarity of the mixes and little nuances to the point where she's just ignoring me!<br /><br />If you can't tell yet, I'm a huge fan of DVD-A's and high-res sound (SACD as well).  I've heard some people complain about 5.1 mixes, from saying that it ruins an original recording (too fancy, sounds swirling around), to there's nothing but abmience and it's nothing special (nothing fancy, no sounds swirling around).  I think it's obvious when listenin gto this what the band and engineers intentions were.  To place you in the studio, or in the case of some songs, sort of... transport you into the heart of the music.  I got sucked in.  I heard someone say it wasn't as good as Beatles' Love.  Well, Love is all studio trickery my friend, based on original Beatles songs.  That is not, in any way, how the Beatles intended for those songs to be heard.  These are easily as good as DVD-A's for Eagles' Hotel California and Queen's Night At The Opera.<br /><br />Anyway... enough rambling.  Go to a high-end stereo shop, ask if they have it as a demo to hear it properly.  Don't use MP3's as a basis for this.  Borrow it from a friend, or better yet, trust a strangers opinion and buy this for an amazing listen.  If you're already a Doors fan and you think you've heard this stuff before and this won't be a reason for you to dig out your collection any more often, you're wrong.  Sell your old stuff (even your LP's, they're re-releasing those in August '07!) and get this.  You'll never be happier.ACD as well).

0895260131|5.0|This book is a devastating attack not so much on Islam itself, but its PC (politically correct) Western supporters. The very fact that it needed to be written and published in English is a sad indictment of the direction that our culture is headed.<br /><br />Spencer traces part of the West's confusion to the deconstructionist school of thought (p3). He doesn't, however, mention the founder of deconstructionism himself, Jacques Derrida. Basically, deconstructionism, when applied to written texts, states that the intention of a text can never be known for certain because the setting (cf sitz im leben) of the writer is very different to that of the reader.<br /><br />A good write up of the murder of film-maker Theo van Gogh is provided. However, one doesn't need to look far for further instances of such bloodshed that couldn't all have been included in Spencer's Guide. Consider, for example, Hitoshi Igarashi.<br /><br />It is doubtful that many of the PC crowd will actually read this book, let alone act on it (Spencer's sensible suggestions for action are listed on page 226f), as it is quite confronting. Especially the name of the series to which it belongs - Politically Incorrect Guide (PIG). However, Spencer does include many book recommendations that could quite easily be sourced and lent to a PC friend.<br /><br />Let's not be fools. If there are two sides in a war, and only one side actually realises that they are at war, it is obvious who the victor will be. For your grand-children's sake, read this book, take it seriously and be totally unashamed to be a Westerner.
0679745653|5.0|I can't  believe I waited so long to read this brilliantly written tale!  Truman Capote paints  a picture with his stories using every colour, shape, texture and tone imaginable!  Loved this story, and although I thought the movie was good, it doesn't come close to the book itself.  What a great gift we have been given....as no movie can ever compare to the mind's eye!  We watch Holly Golightly as she comes  to life  before our very eyes. Incidentally, she is quite  different and far more  multidimentional than  in the movie!  A well-told tale.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!!  A great summer read.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'm going to start this out by saying, do NOT! make a final judgments of this record until you've listened to it a few times all the way through. the first time I listened to this, i was just like a lot of the reviewers and just felt kind of disappointed, but then directly afterwards I listened to it again and got more into it, the 3rd time I started to really enjoy it, the fourth time I found myself singing along to it. In the past five hours I've listened to this record none stop, and I still can not get enough. I almost made the mistake of reviewing it after only a couple of listens, but in reality, this record needs to grow on you, and once it does, you'll realize exactly what they were trying to do. <br /> <br />This record is for people with open minds and that are willing to accept the fact that they are doing something totally different. You will not find hybrid theory or Meteora in this record. That sound is totally gone, but once you give this record a chance, and it grows on you, you'll love it just as much or maybe even more then their last records. I can not believe all of the negative reviews I have seen for this record, but I can't help but think that its because you haven't given the record enough listens. Before you review this thing, just listen to the record a bunch of times.  <br /> <br />in my opinion, this record is amazing & it was totally worth the four year wait. There are so many different genres of music in this one little disk that a music freak like me would just totally eat it up. The record goes from metal, to modern rock, to hip-hop, to punk, to ska, and a lot of others. The record is so different but at the same time it still feels like a linkin park record, which is very hard to pull off. i think my only complaints about this record are its too short (but longer then their other two records) and it would be nice to have more Mike and Joe on it.  <br /> <br />stand out tracks imo would be: Given Up, one of the heaviest songs on the record if not the heaviest, and will defiantly satisfied old linkin park fans or people that want their heavy stuff i should say. Leave Out All The Rest, a slower song but Chester's voice is just amazing in the song and the music is just so relaxing...this song will grow on you, just give it a few chances. It would make a great single. Bleed It Out, one of the two songs that mike raps on, his rapping skills are amazing, it's a very upbeat song and would make a great single as well. What I've Done, you've heard it, love it or hate it, I've always loved this song. Hands Held High, a song obviously about the bush administration and if you read the lyrics they actually say some pretty humorous stuff about bush. No More Sorrow, another really heavy song and will make older linkin park fans happy. Valentines Day, great ballad that explodes into a very heavy song and is very emotional and great. Probably a lot of people will be able to relate to it. In Pieces, the song I was looking forward to the most. It has really different drumming, ska/clash-like guitars and also a great guitar solo in it. One of the best songs on the whole record. The Little Things Give You Away, amazing song and has the solo that every linkin park fan has been waiting for and its very beautiful and the whole song is just great.  <br /> <br />Agree or Disagree, I think this record is amazing and if you give it a few listens I'm sure you'll fall in love with it. If not, that sucks and its too bad you don't like it. <br /> <br />Just like Meteora, I'm dying for their next record already. Hope the next one comes out a little sooner though :P <br /> <br />peace!   <br />
B000A6T262|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet...BUY IT! This \\"IS\\" the ultimate Star Trek movie collection. When I bought this set on Amazon, I paid less than $10 per movie. Now, that's a pretty low price for any \\"ordinary\\" DVD...but, these \\"are not\\" ordinary DVD's! These DVD's have audio commentaries, trailers, gems from the cutting room floor, and much more. Simply put this is the best DVD set I've ever purchased and the price was unbelievably LOW! I couldn't find it for less ANYWHERE! <br /> <br />P.S. - Make SURE you get WIDESCREEN so you don't miss a thing!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Awesome! This movie rock!<br /><br />Audio is much better than the original version. It's really worth it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minuets to Midnight is different from their other cds, but its Linkin Park!!! To hear Chester and Mike together doing what they do best is awesome. From the other reviews I have read, the people who think this cd sucks, you are NOT a true LP fan. Who cares its different. Everything changes and this is a great change. Mike and Chester, they are LP and why not have a change with those two? I'm also excited to have another cd to my LP collection!
1591396190|5.0|I really recommend this book for those that have the challenge of growing a mature business or the need of coming up with a business strategy that changes the rules of the game.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|The final Star Trek film is the most underapreciated in my opinion. I have and always shall be a trekkie. I have all the films and enjoy everyone of them though some are better than others. I have always enjoyed the Romulan stories and for the first time the Romulans are in one of the movies, and it just happens to be the final one. It was a very well done story and is one of my favorites.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Well, I must say that as soon as the local music store opened this morning, I was there buying this album. The single \\"What I've Done\\" was a huge hit with me, and I was hoping for more of the same with the rest of the tracks. I was a little let down, hence the 4-star rating, but I still think it's a good album overall. I personally have no problem with the deeper meaning to most of the songs. Plus, you have to admit, Chester is a pretty good vocalist. The song closest to \\"old-school\\" LP, is \\"Bleed It Out.\\" I had to listen to this song 5 times in a row because it's so catchy. Like some other posters, I miss Mike. His presence just isn't felt for most of this album. He's at his best in \\"Bleed It Out\\" and Hands Held High.\\" Also, I'm left wondering where Mr. Hahn is. Outside of directing the \\"What I've Done\\" video, he doesn't seem to be included musically to the best of his abilities. In both the previous albums, Mr. Hahn had a full track to showcase his talent. Not this time. Now that LP has branched out, I'm kind-of hoping that they trim some of that extra growth and find a happy medium between the prior two albums, and this one.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was really suprised to see the negative reviews. I am currently enjoying the album. It's different from the old stuff but it is still great. I actually like the \\"Filler Song\\" Given Up, it's rather catchy. But to each there own I guess.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|Cohen's timeless debut has been enhanced by the addition of 2 extra tracks. The lilting poetry of Suzanne lures the listener into his world of romantic despair while introducing the essence of his sound: a deep monotone framed by sublime female backing vocals over simple but engaging melodies.<br /><br />Master Song, Winter Lady and Stranger Song reinforce the desolate landscape although the melodies are less immediate. Cohen's genius shines brightly on the immortal Sisters Of Mercy, a strange mixture of the spiritual and the sensual that must be one of the most beautiful musical poems in the English language.<br /><br />This delicate gem is followed by the powerful and evocative So Long Marianne and the understated Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, both masterpieces of words, melody and arrangement - the female vocals on Goodbye is especially impressive.<br /><br />Stories of the Street appears as a poem in one of Cohen's 1960s poetry books: [[ASIN:0670002348 Selected Poems 1956-1968]] and deals with a visit to Havana during of just after the revolution. Interesting fact: The line \\"some girls wander by mistake\\" from Teachers was later used as an album title by the goth band Sisters Of Mercy: [[ASIN:B000005RMY Some Girls Wander By Mistake]]<br /><br />One Us Cannot Be Wrong addresses the beloved in a series of strange images before moving on to melodic whistling and ending with bitter shouted la la lahs. For those interested in other artists' take on Cohen: Suzanne has been beautifully covered by inter alia Judy Collins [[ASIN:B0002M5TE8 Sings Leonard Cohen: Democracy]] and Geoffrey Oryema: [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]], while Sting and the Chieftains' celtic version of Sisters Of Mercy is available on the [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen]] tribute album.<br /><br />On the I'm Your Fan tribute there are interesting interpretations of Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye by Ian McCulloch, Stories Of The Street by That Petrol Emotion and So Long Marianne by James.<br /><br />This reissue booklet includes liner notes by Anthony DeCurtis, three black & white photographs of LC and two full-color paintings by the artist. Both extra tracks were originally produced by John Hammond and for reissue by Bruce Dickinson.

B000NVIGC0|4.0|Contrary to other reviews (perhaps written impulsively after one listen through), Sky Blue Sky is neither Wilco's best nor worst album.  While it's very much different from the past three (in good and bad ways), there are still glimpses of past songs here and there that make it undeniably Wilco.  The overall sound seems heavily influenced from 70's AM rock, reminiscent of Steely Dan and McCartney/Lennon's solo stuff.  Tweedy's lyrics are less abstract than the previous records, and gone are the wild, experimental tracks like \\"Spiders/Kidsmoke\\" and \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\".  What results are some beautifully-written songs using more traditional instrumentation (think \\"How To Fight Loneliness\\" and \\"Kamera\\").  While this may disappoint some Wilco fans who aren't ready for a change, Sky Blue Sky is still a good record worthy of praise.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|When I 1st learned of the release of all 7 seasons of West Wing in one package I knew that I would eventually be in possession of it. <br />It is certainly cheaper than buying the individual seasons on their own, and this box set is a MUST BUY for all fans of the series. <br />If you like politics, history, or just good drama, then you must be interested in The West Wing. <br /> <br />The box contains all 7 seasons, which are neatly organized in 7 folders just like in a west wing office. Also contains a sort of table of contents for the seasons, it goes over every episode with a little synopsis to remind you of what happens, and for ease it also provides you with the season and disk number so you can find it easily. And finally it includes a  script of the 1st episode especially fun for occasional fans and die hards alike.  <br /> <br />In the end this was an amazing buy that I don't regret at all. It's a good way to kill a rainy weekend, or to just spend an afternoon all to myself and enjoy a good episode (and those are plenty) of West Wing.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I've been a Linkin Park fan since \\"One Step Closer\\" first came out, and I was really excited about this album. Even after hearing \\"What I've Done\\", which grew on me very quickly, I wasn't shaken because I thought the album would still be solid. Well, all I can say after a few listens is that it's not bad. I can't really offer much more. It's not Hybrid Theory or Meteora. It's really mellow, although the band does show a few glimpses of its former self on songs such as \\"Given Up\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\" (in my opinion, the best two tracks on the album). Not all the songs are melodic, but are just plain different. \\"What I've Done\\" is a good example of this, as is \\"Bleed It Out\\" (which is one of the only tracks on the entire CD that features Mike rapping). All-in-all I consider this album slightly above average, but it's no where in the league of its predecessors. The band said the first two albums took between three to six months each to make, while this one took well over a year. If that's the case, I really hope they don't spend much time on their next album.
0743289684|5.0|Very pleasant reading, you learn so much about about the culture of the Somalis and muslims told by a female author. In her story (autobiography) you are learning without reading a history book . It is a cultural shock for us westeners, but you can't stop reading it.It\\"s also about the aweakening of a girl and her believes about her faith and family values. <br />I loved it.
B000NA2776|5.0|this CD will make you happy!! <br />most of the songs are fast beat and you just wanna dance! <br />
B000NQR7LQ|4.0|I cant say enough about the sound of the enhanced Cd. Dont worry about <br />an SACD player,this will \\"kick\\" on your own system! The only part I did not like was the DVD footage, the interviews were quite good,but the \\"US television bootleg\\" and the the Japanese television bootleg\\" were terrible! <br />The TV boot,came from the Mike Douglas Show. You can hardly make out their <br />faces,poor quality of sound. The Japanese footage was full of shadows! <br />In the interview section,Steve Hackett(of course leaves after this one) <br />talks about feeling  intimidated with the other members on their writting <br />capabilities. Banks gives you the impression that he is \\"the boss\\" on this musical journey! Rutherford does compliment Hackett on the great job on \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\". Hackett states he did almost everything except play the drums on that one. I am really excited for this musical <br />venue to come out. Again, dont worry about the SACD player ,you WILL HEAR THE DIFFERENCE! Remember,its the sound we are after,the DVD is just an added feature.
B000002JNJ|2.0|I bought this ancient cd at a thrift store, donated back 3 days later. I didn't find this cd all that great. Cowboys from hell was the only good song. everything else on this cd is just noisy boring riffs with typical guitar solos that have been done to death by millions of other players. The song structure is typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus-verse-guitar solo-chorus. This is one of the main reason I don't listen to modern day music except rap (underground). Dimebagg Darrel needed alittle more practice, He is not a Legend. Don't get me wrong, he died horribly. But come on people.. A Legend??! They are hundreds of amazing blues and jazz guitarist that have had a short life and they didn't get the praise they deserve. <br />Phil cannot sing (scream). He sounds like he's singing on the toilet and taking a huge dump. The drummer is so-so. And I cant even hear the bassist. <br />I tried to give this album a chance but I always fall sleep halfway through the album. I don't understand why is this album so popular maybe I have poor taste.. whatever it is I still give it 2 stars for the effort and the 1st track.
B000NQR7KM|4.0|Whatever they did to enhance the sound of this Cd,its wonderful! The packaging of this is very nice too. One CD  music, the other Cd the Enhanced version of Trick plus the DVD section.  <br />  The DVD is comprised of interviews about Trick and footage of the band. On this particular DVD, it has \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\", which was played  on MTV many moons ago. That was great! Genesis in this stage of their musical journey  was just getting over the departure of Peter Gabriel.Watch the interview part,they explained how Phil was not to be the original singer. They had many singers, but just could not make that unity. I am sorry back to DVD concert footage. This is the first time you have a great view of Bill Bruford playing extremely well.(looks like a young kid!)  <br />  This is going to be a series of all the Genesis music, including The Lamb. I saw on the internet everything, Foxtrot,Nursery Crime..etc.. I suggest only the best one Trick of the Tail.Guys this is worth getting!
B000O174CM|4.0|Based on the 1981 Broadway musical comes \\"Dreamgirls\\", a story of greed, tough hate, and romance. Three young women - Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles),  Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) - desire to become pop stars and get their wish when they're picked to be backup singers for the legendary James \\"Thunder\\" Early (Eddie Murphy). Then they're set free for leads, but Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) and Effie's brother C.C. (Keith Robinson) decide for Deena to be lead which upsets Effie. Spanning the rock `n' roll sounds of the late `50's, pop sounds of the 1960's, and the disco spin of the 1970's- \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a mix of a rock `n' show, a Broadway musical (they sing a lot of their dialogue), and an urban city drama- rarely do we see any Caucasian actors unless they're being portrayed as \\"the bad guy\\" (example: the \\"white\\" audience at the Vegas night club).  \\"Dreamgirls\\" is entertaining in the story which could just as well be called \\"Diana Ross and the Supremes- Road to Motown,\\" in it's similarities- check out the scene with the `70's group that is a carbon copy of \\"The Jackson 5\\" with the little boy singing and dancing like Michael!<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, however, the soundtrack is lacking any \\"stand out\\" songs, that we haven't heard before.  Jennifer gives a powerful performance singing \\"And I Tell You I'm Not Going\\" which brings to mind an early Aretha Franklin.  The other songs are pretty much forgettable and the  only song that has some real stage performance presence, is \\"Only One Night\\"- which goes from a soulful ballad to a disco dance hit.  Jennifer and Beyonce both do a great job singing this one.  The entire cast does a great job bringing \\"Dreamgirls\\" from the stage to the screen and took home several coveted awards for their efforts.<br /><br />2-disc version is the way to go if you REALLY loved the movie or 1-disc version if you only enjoyed it somewhat.<br />I purchased the 2-disc version mainly to add it to my DVD library of musicals- and it was on a really good sale! Kudos to Jennifer Hudson's award winning performance and to Beyonce Knowles for her stellar performance as Deena (another name for Diana Ross- the Diana likeness really shows in the numerous photo sessions) and Jamie Foxx's \\"grab-for-power Quincey Jones\\" role as Curtis Taylor Jr is also notable. Jennifer Hudson's award winning performance is a knock-out! It's just too bad there's a short supply of attractive leading men (except for Keith Robinson) for these beautiful ladies to co-star with- Jamie Foxx (Ugg!), Eddie Murphy (Ugg!)- but then again the movie is called \\"Dreamgirls,\\" not \\"Dreamboys,\\" and it shows!als- and it was on a really good sale!

0743289684|4.0|The book is an autobiography of this courageous woman - Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who tells her story from childhood in Africa, to Dutch citizenship and through to her current day stay at United States. Although autobiographical in style, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's real goal is to tell her story of her experiences with Islam and contrast it to free societies such as the ones she encountered in Europe and particularly in Holland.<br /><br />Having come from a regular African Islamic family, she managed to escape an arranged marriage, sought an asylum in Holland and achieved the unimaginable for a person of her descent - climbed to the position of power, an elected Parliament member.<br /><br />She defined herself as the most prominent critic of Islamic culture, especially focusing on its treatment of women - calling it an act of submission. Having suffered an unfortunate, although regular, childhood for an African Islamic girl, having experienced a death of her friend filmmaker Theo Van Gough and having lived under constant serious threats for months on end, she continues to admonish Islam, its culture and religion, working out of American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Although an atheist and a freethinker, she annoys the liberals  with her constant criticism of Islam and worries conservatives with her rage  rant against religions in general. To me, however, she is nothing less than a hero!<br /><br />The reason why I gave it 4 stars, is simply due to her writing style, particularly her rather quick and sporadic transitions. In addition, she utilizes too many names in her book (family, friends, members of Parliament) which can be quite confusing and unnecessary at times.<br /><br />Otherwise, a terrific read and highly recommended, especially for liberals who spend countless hours debating and defending the diverse cultures, even such as ones she harshly criticizes in her book. Also, good read for conservatives who can possibly learn from this and hopefully push back on the modern Religious Right movement which has hijacked this country, its true ideals and values and substituted it with their theocratic views.lly push back on the modern Religious Right movement which has hijacked this country, its true ideals and values and substituted it with their theocratic views.
0743270754|5.0|At first glance, it might seem easy to write a biography of a legend like Lincoln, but in fact it must be really difficult to write about an icon. This difficulty has led to lots of revisionist history. Ms. Goodwin does not succomb to this temptation. This is one of the most readable books I've ever read. We see such a description of Character. In Lincoln, there is humility, loyalty, compassion balanced with skill, insight and wisdom. It was a very inspiring book. You can see the worth of this remarkeable man and why this team of what started as rivals became men totally impressed with the President that they loved to serve.

0618680004|5.0|This puts into words the angst one feels being oppressed by religion in the modern world.  Dawkins breaks down the theistic arguments into manageable pieces like an experienced diagnostician, and puts them into an analytical framework:  Define god.  Weigh the evidence.  Point out misinformation and sources of confusion.  Put possible outcomes within probabilistic tendencies and leave it at that.  Spend life learning and considering anything and everything.  Recognize that any \\"faith\\" is in a premature decision that would stifle others exploring other equally probable outcomes. <br /> <br />It's a breath of fresh air in this age where unchallenged rhetoric passes as debate and christianity is a force fed requirement of goodness.  If you believe you \\"gotta have faith\\", if you believe the founding fathers were evangelical christians, if you go to church, if you come from a religious background, if you feel the need for answers to life's questions, you need this book.   <br /> <br />Dawkins demonstrates that not only is faith unnecessary, it may be the greatest threat to freedom and democracy.  Dawkins points to the warnings of our founding fathers. <br /> <br />This is a must read.  A faith that cannot sustain the arguments of this book has fools for followers.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|This is a good cd...had it been a new band coming out that wasnt Linkin Park. Linkin Park has built its name on the fusion of synthesizing great beats and rhythms along with hard rock & rap. As a former die hard fan their music was classic even before it was classic...if you know what I mean.  <br /> <br />However because they chose to become beyond commercial with their latest \\"regular\\" rock music I give this CD TEN THUMBS DOWN because the general consesus agrees with me: THIS CD SUCKS! (read more reviews) If your a linkin park member reading reviews on AMAZON know that you dissappointed your fans. Stick to what your good at and dont be another rock band, they are a dime a dozen...which is about what I should have paid for this lame cd.  <br /> <br />Here is some advice: dont think that you cant lose your fan base because your linkin park. Your name means nothing if your music isnt what we expect and want. Supply and Demand!
B000JBWWRY|4.0|good quality. daughter enjoyed it. happy with the way it was shipped.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Is this the Linkin Park (LP) we've come to adore and jam with? Definitely NO. What the album lacks is cohesiveness; one song sounds uncannily like U2 another blatantly Metallica. Indeed another song sounds distinctly ballad-esque. If you're thinking, WTF, you'd have every right to be confused at this point.<br /><br />  While musicians can certainly attain inspiration from other artists, LP on this album sounds like they're trying to emulate the sounds of other bands, rather than re-invent the sounds as new. Basically the music doesn't \\"sound\\" anything like what LP fans have been listening to for the past two albums. To worsen matters, the songs seem to vary from soft rock to rock to metal. It's a mediocre, mixed bag of songs at best.<br /><br />  The techno/rap/electronic influences are mostly absent so one gets a sort of diluted, artificial sound. To characterize the album in one word: ersatz.<br /><br />  It's woefully disappointing to hear an increase in cursing on the tracks as anyone can swear, but we demand more of artists: creativity. There's a noticeable increase of cursing verbage used, which again seems utterly uninspired. Sadly, many of the tracks are utterly forgettable.<br /><br />  Frankly, the best song on the album is the single currently on airwaves, \\"What I've done.\\" It's mostly for that song alone I'd rate the album a C+ (3 stars). Hopefully this new sound is a phase, a stepping stone towards something authentic, and memorable.<br /><br />P.S. This listener has not lost all confidence in, and hopes better from the masterful group, Linkin Park.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|When the single(What I've Done) was released I was hoping it was one of the softer songs on the album...  Wrong! There is only one or two songs on the album that are harder/heavier.  Most of the other songs are ballad-like.<br /><br />The album has a U2 feel to it, which is not a bad thing.  However, as everyone else is saying, it is not the Linkin Park sound that...well...makes Linkin Park who they are.  Perhaps they are trying to redefine themselves.<br /><br />It is just not the sound that Linkin Park fans have come to expect from Linkin Park.  Very little of the heavy screaming, heavy guitar munging, and angry rap.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers definitely make great great music. \\"Somebody Told Me\\", \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and \\"Mr.Brightside\\" are some of my favorite songs overall. <br />But some songs I don't like..... <br />I still think it's worth buying!
B000NA28HU|3.0|I had seen the commercials, \\"man I cannot wait to get to se it.\\"  Well I saw the movie it was awesome! After being so pumped up about the movie, it was only natural of me to read the book.  After just a couple pages I realized that the movie STUNK! They changed like SO much and also added stuff that was so unnececery!  Like at the end, Eragon did not kill Durza in a dragon fight, He killed Durza by stabbing him with Zarroc!  Listen if you read the book first you will be disapointed, but if you read the book afterwards you will get to enjoy the movie then be dissapointed later.  All-in-all I think that if you see the movie, you need to read the book.  And for your information Eragon id an AWESOME BOOK!!!! I would totally recommened the book but the movie would be up to you. <br />-BHC

B000IFQLSW|5.0|What a wonderful CD and DVD.  I'm glad to see that the music of these \\"old timers\\" won't be lost.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Like many of the posters, I've been waiting on pins and needles to get my hands on LP's new release. And like most of the reviews I've read, I'm disappointed. Listening to LP was a state of mind. It got you pumped up. The mix of Chester's screaming with the hip-hop created a one of kind sound you didn't get from any other band. This album erases all that. I want screaming Chester, not the mild, thoughtful and melodious Chester. An earlier poster said this was LP's version of U2's Joshua Tree, a defining album for their future. I agree with part of that assessment, except I think the LP album is more comparable to  U2's Pop disaster. I'm all for growing musically, but remember your roots. LP pulled up the tree with this thing. <br />
B000MQ54OY|5.0|The Happy Feet Blu-ray DVD is a wonderful (if not the best) example of the current state of the art in animated film technology married w/ 1080p video output.

One of our family members stated that \\"the picture really jumps off of the screen\\".
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|What a great way to show the world what we need to take care of now. Kind of scary what the imagination of the future may hold.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I'm listening to this record for the third time, and I think it's their best effort in a long time.  As it grows on me, it might surpass Presto. <br />That said, I haven't been overwhelmed by anything they've done in the interim.  Roll the Bones had two or three decent songs, but by Rush standards I thought it was quite a letdown.  Counterparts was a refreshing change of direction and had some good songs, but also some very bad songs.  Test for Echo saw this band hit rock bottom- it was so bad that a buddy of mine put his cigarette out on the disc to express his disgust with the effort, and I did not harbor a grudge.  Surprisingly Rush bounced back with Vapor Trails, which I, like many others, found to be extremely well-conceived, but extremely poorly executed- some very good, hard-driving Rush that was mixed and edited in awful fashion. <br /> <br />There has been lively debate here about whether Snakes and Arrows sounds like old-school Rush.  While I find some aesthetic similarities to Permanent Waves, this is an album with its own identity.  There may not be any instantly recognized Rush \\"anthems\\" to come from this album, but aside from \\"Bravest Face\\" I don't find any throwaway tracks either.  All these songs have something to offer.  There are some catchy melodies, but they are used sparingly, even within the songs that exhibit them- a technique that I like.  I love the sound of the guitars on this album, and Lifeson plays them expertly.  The bass seems somewhat subdued for a Rush album.  Neil's drumming is expert as always, with more fills and shifts than the last few releases (the sonic quality of Vapor Trails made any drum fills virtually undetectable).  My favorite tracks early on are \\"Spindrift\\" and \\"Main Monkey Business\\".  <br /> <br />Hemispheres this is not.  But this a surprisingly solid effort from this ageless trio.  The music of Rush appeals to its fans on many different levels; some have listened to this album and were disappointed.  I find it to betheir best release in almost 20 years. <br />
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Anyone who deems this album boring is stuck in Wilco's \\"AM\\" days.  This album is a work of sheer art.  Nels Kline surely adds a whole new dimension to the sound and compositions.  Tweedy is spot on as usual - great lyrics, music and soul.  Buy it and support on of the last pure American rock bands.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|wow..alt, country...i wanna love it ,i try to love it..but i dont..im sure all alt country acts have great record collections themselves, but AM by WILCO is the only lp of the alt country scene that ido truly love..i love all wilco and loose fur and autumn defence records..for me WILCO are one of the only truly great,intreseting bands of the last 30 years or so....they are also one of the only bands who evolve,change, flow, and follow their muse..i think its mind blowingly tragic how conservative most music listeners are these days..they want their bands to stick to the formular...surley what made such a big part of THE BEATLES,NEIL YOUNG,DYLAN,VELVETS.ETC..EVEN..JOHN COLTRANE,SUN RA ETC  was their relentless dedication to their art and muse...its their uncomprimising stance that made them who they are..And it was WILCO,S  similar stance for YANKEE FOXTROT that has made them whom they are...please ,dont tell me we have got sooooo conservative that you cant love a gentle country love song.followed by a long electronic drone??.. SO, that brings me to SKY BLUE SKY..ive heard it over and over for a few weeks now..and i love it...its very much WILCO and again its very much something new..the journy continues.and i still cant spell....nels cline guitar solo,s are beautiful thoughtful, strange dreamlike, jewels that have added a strange wonderking demension to this albums..i cant explain how much he has added to the album...and TWEEDY,S song all make sense..a calmer,open,beauty bounty of songs coming from a man whom i gather has just left a fairly hellish period of his life...so lyrics..like MAYBE THE SUN WILL SHINE..etc make perfect sense to me...a great great album..by one of the only great bands left
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this movie at a theater and was moved. When I bought this item and watched it on Good Friday alone, I wept like I have never wept before. After the movie was finished my head was full of everything, mental and physical. It took me many tissues to remove what this movie had done to me. Christ saved us. He took all our punishment on Himself, which this movie has shown us. If this movie doesn't affect you, I would suggest pleading to God for Him to send down His Grace upon you.

B000NA28I4|5.0|I preordered the movie Eragon from the seller, product came exactly as advertised and in the timeframe listed in the sellers advertisement
B000OCXMAE|4.0|There is 2 ways I look at this album.  One from being a LP fan and also from a total music perspective.  As a long time LP fan I'm a bit dissapointed.  There is definately elements of this album that could've been on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but very little. LP have branched out in some other territory...maybe somewhere near U2. That would be the best way for me to explain it, but still somewhere else.  Minutes To Midnight is LP's slowest and softest to date.  Not to many rock out parts.  Stranglely on the song \\"Given Up\\" they come up with their heaviest part ever.  Not a good way to start off the album, when the rest is pretty mellow.  That was a letdown for me. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this album was totally unpredictable for me.  I enjoy hearing artists evolve, and try new things.  When I first heard \\"What I've Done\\", I was a bit letdown.  It sounded too much like other LP songs.  Though I do enjoy the song, I found the rest of the album a big change. Song by song, I was hearing things I've never heard from LP.  Brad breaking into a solo, choir like chorus', Mike singing, longer songs, and LP breaking away from the verse-chorus-verse-chorus formula.  The drawback is these are mostly mellow songs.  This is a different Linkin Park. They took an awful lot of risks with the album and may alienate some fans. I think this is their most musical album to date.  Time will tell if it has long legs, but after a few listens it's growing on me.  Last song on the album \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\", best track overall.  Amazing song.  <br />
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is truly an amazing album, not for the pretend fans though that bash it because they tried something different.  This album is for fans that are open minded, and can appreciate all kinds of music, as long as it is quality<br /><br />This album takes two listens: one to get you over the initial shock of the change, and another to get you deeper into the meaning of the music. Song breakdown:<br /><br />Wake: cool intro, great way to start off. 5/5<br /><br />Given Up: One of my favorites on the album.  The best Chester has ever sounded vocally; great song! Has a punk feel to it, which is not a bad thing at all.  5/5<br /><br />Leave Out All The Rest: Mellow song, but not bad.  This sounds like another single; it is a soothing ballad with clean vocal talent and great musical accompaniment.  Not my favorite track, but it is still very well done. 5/5<br /><br />Bleed It Out: another favorite; you can tell through the music and live performance especially how much LP loves this song (they smile the whole time).  No one can argue against the rhythm and greatness the track offers. 5/5<br /><br />Shadow Of The Day: takes a full listen to enjoy it (don't skip after ten seconds).  Really cool string section and guitar work. Absolutely AMAZING song; reminiscent of U2's \\"With Or Without You,\\" which is also an amazing song.  At first, this song is shocking to an Lp listener, because it is so different from the other material, but this song is one of the best ever to be recorded.  5/5<br /><br />What I've Done: good song, but not the best on the album; took a few listens to get into it.  Still, it's a great song. 4.5/5<br /><br />Hands Held High: I love this song; if I could give more then 5 I would; it;s deep, powerful, and Mike's talent never ceases to amaze me.  The band's choice of instruments and vocals are genius. 5/5<br /><br />No More Sorrow: Arguably the heaviest track here, and it's great. Really solid intro, heavy music and lyrics, fantastic vocal delivery. 5/5<br/><br />Valentine's Day: This song is kind of blah, not a personal favorite.  It does grow on you though, and it does fit into the album's sound.  Overall, the song is enjoyable. 4/5<br /><br />In Between: cool song, but does border on being boring.  Music is great, but I like a little drum beat in my music; this song lacks that. Plus, Mike doesn't really sing here, he just kind of talk-sing-whispers; it's not regular singing.  Toward the end it begins to redeem itself, and it ends up being a worth-while track. 4/5<br /><br />In Pieces: another favorite for me.  Really cool song, just listen all the  way through. Ska guitar, guitar solo, and great vocal delivery. One of the best on the album. 5/5<br /><br />The Little Things Give You Away: starts off slow with weird sound effects and acoustic guitar.  Kinda of weak at first, but after a minute, the track turns for the better.  The drums really stand out for me in this track, as well as the rest of the musical accompaniment.  This song is really well done, and the end is chilling.  The harmonizing by Chester sounds great, as well as the music behind it. This has turned into my favorite song, as well as the best song ever done by them.  It is incredible! 10/5<br /><br />No Roads Left (itunes bonus track): really cool song.  Mike is singing, and actually singing this time, unlike in \\"In Between.\\"  The song should be on the regular release, but what are you gonna do? Cool violins, guitar work and great vocal range make this track worth the itunes download. 5/5<br /><br />Overall, this is a five star album, with a wide range of music and talent.  The band has never sounded better, and I look forward to what they make next, hopefully in less then three years.  I hope you find this review helpful in determining whether or not you should buy this album.  I will say this also; I was not a \\"die hard LP fan\\" before this album.  I have always enjoyed their work, but I never considered them in my top five; this album has pushedme to the other side, and I can personally say they are now my favorite band, as of right now.<br /><br />If you look at any of my previous reviews, they are not nearly as extensive, so that should tell you that this album is important to me.  The music is deep, and well worth the money.  Buy this album, and congratulate Linkin Park on their success for changing for the better by clicking \\"Yes\\" for the helpfulness of this review.<br /><br />P.S. For all of you expecting Meteora pt.2 don't waste your time here bashing this record with your negativity.  You are close minded, and are not open to new things that differ from the past.  Hybrid Theory and Meteora were cool, but I would not be happy if Minutes To Midnight sounded like those; that genre died a while ago.  Don't bash this record because it's different; embrace the changes and see the beauty in the music.
0393327655|3.0|The book starts off with a convincing argument against religious faith and makes a compelling case for reason and scientific thought. The author then in my opinion completely loses his mindset with a long discourse on abstract \\"spirituality\\", and eastern mysticism in the chapter before the epilogue. He seems to suffer a fit of literary schitzophrenia that seems like it belongs in a different book altogether. Very confusing.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was blown away by the incredible layers of tracks; the transitions between tracks was incredible!  It was a psychodelic aural experience!  The liner notes were right: the music does not sound dated, but fresh and current.  I was impressed by the Anthology albums, but this is beyond description!  George Martin has truly outdone himself.  Who knew that 40-year old music could evolve with technology?!  It's difficult to stop in the middle of the album, and not just keep flowing with the music.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Yes, most reviews you read about Minutes To Midnight are negative. \\"There are many slow songs\\" \\"There aren't any songs you can rock out to\\" \\"There is no more rap that made Linkin Park unique in the first place\\". Truth is,  most of these reviews ARE true. However, that doesn't mean the songs are bad. I actually prefer the \\"no rap\\" Linkin Park, but I wish the \\"no rap\\" songs were ones you can actually rock out to. There are some really, REALLY good stand out songs, but only 4 or 5 of those are on this album. I hope Linkin Park releases a better album in the near future after they realize what fans are saying. Don't neglect this album; it's decent, but not the best it could have been.
B000KB6D0A|5.0|Great album.  If you don't know Saxon at this time, then why are you here?  For me, this album and 'Wheels of Steel' are it.  This is what I call European metal.  Its raw, edgy, and just some sweet rock and roll.  Pass the bowl.

B00003CWPL|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CWPL Eraserhead]]  What could I possibly say about this awesome movie that could prepare the uninitiated? Somehow \\"Good luck!\\" or \\"\\"Have fun!\\" or even \\"Trip out!\\" would not suffice...... I saw this movie a dozen times on the midnight circuit over the years, and with gems like \\"Pink Flamingos\\" and \\"Phantom of the Paradise\\" and \\"Freaks\\" and \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\", the midnight movie became my staple for a long, long time. Of them all, \\"Eraserhead\\" ruled supreme. I have had various versions of this over the years, and have seen it more than 30 times. This is the movie that makes, or breaks a relationship. Really. I have my own interpretation of this movie, but you probably wouldn't agree. Henry, our hapless hero, marries into a family that makes the fine folks in \\"Two Thousand Maniacs\\" look like the Cleavers. She is pregnant (the horror!) and has a baby that makes \\"It\\" look like an angel. Henry is tempted by the neighborhood harlot, falls in love with the Cauliflower Lady (who sings the beautiful \\"In Heaven\\")and wanders about looking generally uncomfortable. The kicker is that his head pops off..... and is scooped up by a kid who sells it so that standard #2 pencil erasers can be made from it..... yeah, that kind of movie. This is a GORGEOS print, of one of the greatest movies of all time. The interplay of light and shadow is closer to visual expressionism (I always hear people call it surrealism- but I think it's closer to \\"Caligari\\" myself)and many of the cool effects that Lynch used here showed up in the beautiful \\"Elephant Man.\\"
B000OCXMAE|5.0|When I first listened to the album, my initial reaction was that LP had gone soft/melancholy and I too was a bit disappointed.  However, the more I listened to it and the more I let the melodies and lyrics sink in, the more I enjoyed it.  Sure, it's not the rap/rock, heavy guitar riff Linkin Park from previous albums but every band needs to grow up.  It's not all change though as Chester's screaming is back and Mike's rap on \\"hands up\\" is reminiscent of  a track from the Fort Minor album but for the most part, this album is a departure for them.  It's full of political/social undertones and lyrically, LP have never been better.  I hope all LP fans (and everyone else who enjoys a good album) give it a chance and judge this album as it's own entity (stand out track for me include \\"Leave out all the rest and Shadow of the day\\".
0790737345|1.0|\\"Wings of Desire\\" (the movie that \\"City of Angels\\" is loosely inspired upon), is a masterpiece and \\"City of Angels\\" is...is... how could I explain it not being too rude? It is just a piece of junk in comparison. Somebody wrote that he didn't like \\"Wings of Desire\\" because he didn't feel the same as he felt watching \\"City of Angels\\". I agree in the \\"feeling\\" part, because  I felt nausea watching \\"City of Angels\\" and that didn't happen to me watching \\"Wings of Desire\\"!! I own \\"Wings of Desire\\" and have seen it and enjoyed it many times. Regarding \\"City of Angels\\", well I rented it and barely could see it once!
B000HLDFKE|5.0|First, I'm prevewing this HD DVD combo version of this film.<br /><br />This is a very unusual story. It's interesting and romantic. I can't reveil the content of the story without spoiling the enjoyment of watching it. It is a creative movie with new ideas, perhaps never attempted before.<br /><br />The HD DVD picture quality on this combo version is absolutely awsome on my 101\\" projected screen via HDMI on my Toshiba HD-A1. It does display film like quality and the transfer was clean.<br /><br />The standrad DVD version (on the back!) is also sharp. Well worth the money!
B000MV9026|5.0|This movie will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time. Anybody who knows me can honestly say that I don't smile easily. I think it's because I have little or no sense of humor, and things that most people find funny, I don't find amusing at all. When I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised because I was on the floor laughing. I think this movie is so visually beautiful at times I couldn't help but smile. There are few cartoons that I like, watch, or even give the time of day, but I just felt drawn to this movie. I'm glad to say it wasn't a total waste of time. I think people of all ages will love this despite the fact that it is a child's movie because the music is awesome and done with taste instead of being raunchy and disrespectful. I have watched this movie so many times that I love to sing-a-long. I recommend buying this movie definitely. I think the kids will really enjoy this one.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Great DVD of one of Shania's best concerts ever! Though, not as good as seeing her live and shaking her hand!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I must admit the mixed pre-release reviews of this album left me a little anxious about my iTunes pre-order. I have been a fan of Linkin Park since \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and jumped to their rock/hip-hop beats every time they played a show in my area. It is with discriminating ears that I listened to \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" on release day. Without going into a review of each song as several people aleady have, my overall feeling at the end of the album is: Wow, that was awesome! While very different from both \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", Linkin Park has surpassed the quality, range and appeal of these previous efforts with \\"Minutes to Midnight\\".
B000NVIGC0|4.0|This is the best Grateful Dead album I've heard in a long time.  But seriously, it's a great listen, if you're willing to accept the fact that for now, the Wilco that brought you YHF and AGIB is dead.  This album sounds like a soft-rock jam band sequel to Summerteeth.  It's good, but the driving avant-garde pop piano riffs of the past few years take a backseat this time around.  Jeff Tweedy is clean and the tension is gone, for better or worse.  As a diehard fan, this one's obviously a must-have, and it should have a bit more mass appeal, but I was expecting something with a few more risks.  A lot of people have maligned that attitude on the past few records, and those folks will be tickled pink by this album.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I would label myself a relatively casual Rush fan...really loved them in high school (Moving Pictures/Exit Stage Left etc.), lost track of them a bit in the 90's, now back on board (I was lucky enough to see them on the Vapor Trails tour, what a great show they still do after all these years).  Vapor Trails had its moments but I like Snakes and Arrows MUCH more, the songs are more intricate and memorable, I also love that Alex Lifeson is incorporating more guitar textures (acoustic, effects, etc.) instead of just wailing (even though his wailing is awfully good in itself!).  The bass lines are awesome (I love to turn the bass up so I can appreciate Geddy's genius) and believe it or not, I am kind of glad that Geddy can't hit the same high notes he used to.  I never had a problem with his voice, but the fact that he is a little less shrieky actually improves their music in my opinion.  Not every single song on here is a \\"keeper\\" but overall there are a lot of songs that stick in your head and the instrumentals are pretty cool, too.  If you love any of Rush's past work, you'll find plenty to like here.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series should win every Cinematography award for the next five years!  Even if there were no narrator and no information, this would still be a great DVD series.  My family and I watch it, the kids don't even know they are learning.  We plan to give this as our standard present to all the families we know.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble got me interested in \\"the classics\\" like Sinatra, Elvis and many other greats. This new album shows, like his previous ones, how great their music was and how sad contemporary music is. \\"Call me irresponsible\\" is absolutely fantastic, especially \\"I'm your man\\" and \\"Comin' home baby\\".
B0000CDLA7|5.0|For fans familiar with Dream Theater, nothing needs to be said about the musicianship.  For new fans, it helps to listen to a song at least 5 to 10 times before passing judgement.  The songs have so much depth that a listener cannot grasp it all with a single listen.  I'm a guitar guy, John Petrucci is the most skilled rock guitar player in the world IMHO.  Mike Portnoy's percussion on this album is mind boggling.  Not just technical, but really accessible and interesting.  This album, along with Octavarium, DT displays a new level of polish with their song writing that really appeals to my ear.  Buy this album, listen to it ten times, and prepare to become a new obsessive Dream Theater fan.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Ok, Here's what I think. If you're a die hard Linkin Park fan, then listening to this album for the first time is going to disappoint you. But, give it about a week (if it takes that long) and you soon find out that the sound isn't THAT different, they just don't have Mike Shinoda on the Lead Vocals and Joe Hahn isn't DJing much. Most songs on the album are unmistakably Linkin Park (\\"Given Up\\", \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\", \\"In Pieces\\", \\"Valentines Day\\"), But even those songs sound like another band could do them without sounding like Linkin Park. Other Songs (\\"Shadow of the Day\\", \\"No More Sorrow\\", \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\") Take a different direction and make them sound like a different band. Mike Shinoda is the lead vocalist on only Three songs, two of which he raps on (\\"Bleed it Out\\" and \\"Hands Held High\\") and one of which he sings on (\\"In Between\\") which is something he should leave to Chester in my opinion. \\"What I've Done\\" is probably the most of the old LP that you're going to get out of this album. Actually, when \\"What I've Done\\" came out, everyone was saying how much different they sounded, something I really didn't hear, and how much they've changed and it just so happens that this song sounds the closest to the Linkin Park we all know and love than any of the others. <br /> <br />One thing on this album that differs from their previous albums, for me, is that I find myself skipping two tracks (\\"Shadow of the Day\\" and \\"In Between\\"). This is different because I'm usually able to listen to Linkin Park albums, including \\"Reanimation\\", all the way through without skipping one track. So, needless to say, I don't really think this is their best effort and I don't believe this is a classic. <br /> <br />Overall the album is good enough to listen to. It's still Linkin Park. They haven't really change that much, but as I have said, you probably won't really like it the first time around. This album has to grow on you and it's a pretty good album when it does, but this will probably be your least favorite of the Linkin Park albums.
1582701709|5.0|It is very interesting way to live easier. It is a way to see things better and to feel better. There is nothing new but it is how to do it! <br />It is a book to read every time and have it close to you! Just to remeber! To consider every time that you start feeling not so good! <br />Read it! Have it!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I Don't Understand all the negative reviews this CD is getting...especially from Pitchfork they are so caught up in weird music they don't appreciate good real rock music..with guitars...and not overdone sampled beats or whatever. This cd is honestly the best wilco cd to follow 2 masterpieces...Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born..which both ive listened to hundreds of times and never dissapoints. but this new cd has guitar solos and genious melodies. BUY IT!
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Wonderful album of Rod Stewart! Fast shipping and great customer service.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have to say - being a Bond fan - that I was concerned that this film would be a watered down, PC version of Bond... starting with the alterations to the imagery of the classic Bond opening and a somewhat different personality for James Bond - more isolated, cold, calculating, not so much the cool double entendre quips - but any concern was erased.  I really do think this may be the best Bond film to date.  Daniel Craig is off to a great start in his role as James Bond.  The level of action in the opening scene is amazing.  My attention was captured - all the way to the enticing ending - this film makes you want more Bond!
B000NA28HU|4.0|I really like this movie, I haven't read the book and I heard that the book is better than the movie, but it doesn't matter to me! I liked the plot, all the caracters, the shadow, the dragon...I was entertaining and the best at all NOT TOO LONG!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Worst album by Wilco??  Come on!!  Sorry there's no drug/pain induced lyrics...no hidden meanings...no 15 minute repetetive songs...if you want abstract, A Ghost Is Born this is not...even Jeff Tweedy himself said he didn't know if he could perform those songs once he cleaned up...fortunately the songs became alive again through sober eyes and ears and they had whole new meaning for him...which is where \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is...eyes opened, ears listening to the world outside the door...it's beautiful, and the best damn thing to come out in years....BUY IT!!!
B000N3ST7K|5.0|Once again, Tarantino offers us a soundtrack with \\"dialogue clips\\" that we will listen to over and over again. Buy it. It belongs in your \\"Tarantino\\" soundtrack collection right next to all the others.
B000M343BM|4.0|Well, thank god they finally updated this movie. The transfer and sound are the same, which is not bad, video is clear but could have used more. The extras are awesome! Tons of material from a very funny interview with Bob Euker?? to cast members then and now, plus a commentary track, alternate ending wich should have been left out and tons more. If you own or even don't own this movie, pick it up. The nice turf cover is cool too. Would have loved a pair of Rick Vaughn Glasses though.
B000001FCB|5.0|At the risk of being accused of massive heresy, I'd like to point out a few things that the potential buyer should be aware of: 1) if you're of a certain generation(younger than say, 40)and aren't accustomed to hearing sacharrine-like string arrangements then there will be about 4 or 5 slow orchestra + singer tracks(non-bossa) on this album that will drive you nuts and distract from Elis's amazing voice. For example, if you get the chance, listen to the version of \\"Modinha\\" on this CD vs. the version with just Elis and Cesar on piano in the Elis DVD. I always skipped this song on the CD and now I'm realizing how sad it is that it was orchestrated...Good heavens just get out of the lady's way and let her sing. This song sounds so much better 'unplugged'! I bet the same would happen with the other tracks. It sounds a bit pretentious since the strings are not needed to make Elis 'better', due to the inherent greatness of the songs...thus, sublime songwriting by Jobim...but he should've nixed the 'ambitious' arrangements! Btw, I also dislike the version of Corcovado here...and I'm not so sure it's the definitive vocal version...I think that honor should go to Joao Gilberto...and once again, I bet if Elis has/had an unplugged version, it probably would be the among the best. Anyhow, just a controversial opinion of mine. I'm sure many disagree!  <br />2)Many are calling this a quintessential bossa album...but nearly half the tracks are not bossa nova but modinhas...slow-tempo dramatic songs that may sound a bit 'over-the-top' to modern ears.  <br />3)This is not my favorite singing by Elis...for my taste she is too polished and restrained on a few of the songs here(with some very notable exceptions such as Aguas de Marco)...although her singing is indeed flawless and unmatched. Call me crazy, I'd much rather hear the relaxed, soulful, or fun Elis in \\"Como Os Nossos Pais\\", \\"Upa Neguinho\\", or \\"Sou Caipira Pira Pora Nossa\\"(not sure about the title), or \\"Alo, Alo Marciano\\". At any rate, Elis was soooo much more than a bossa nova or jazz singer. She was and could be anything!  <br />   Now, as for the priceless songs...these are the ones that I pick as my faves on this CD: <br />1) Aguas de Marco (btw, the end part, in which Elis starts laughing is I think due to the fact that, based on my limited understanding of Portuguese, Elis and Tom start chopping off the first letter of each word starting the refrain phrases...it's onderful!) <br />2) Triste: So sexy...tua beleza e' um aviao, Elis!  <br />3) Retrato em Branco e Preto- Just amazing! The strings aren't as obnoxious here, either. <br />4) Fotografia: brilliant! <br />5) Chovendo na Roseira: One of my favorite songs ever!  <br />6) Inutil Paisagem: Great song for when you're feeling depressed...very cathartic!
B000J10EQU|5.0|This is the best Superman movie in a long time. Some of the special effects are extra cool and the new suit looks great. Brandon Routh did a wonderful job of continuing Christopher Reeve's portrayal. Kevin Spacey is probably the best Lex Luthor I have seen (with the exception of Clancy Brown in the animated Superman and Justice League). Bryan Singer has done an excellent job with this just like he did with the first two X-Men movies.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I love this album.  I can't stop listening to it.  Best new artist that I have heard in a long time.
B00005JKG7|5.0|As an avid horror movie fan I have to say this movie more than any started it all for me.  I remember seeing a run of this on TBS when I was a kid and it scared me half to death.  From there I was hooked and after watching hundreds of horror movies spanning the century this remains one of my favorites.  It's creepy, mysterious and thrilling all of the good components that make for a good scary movie.  There is a remake of it which expands the plot a bit, but didn't seem to me to be any better than the original.  Though dated, I think most would still find it entertaining today.  I couldn't recommend this one more.
1582701709|4.0|This book makes you think about what you think about.  What's your attitude toward life and what you expect.  Bad expectations begets bad results.  Positive expectations brings more positive outcomes.  The old saying: \\"the best time to make a sale is right after you make a sale.\\"  This book applies this concept to all aspects of your life.   <br /> <br />Easier read than applied however.
B000002JS6|5.0|For those who don't know, this is not only a great album but it's also the important album that demonstrated AC/DC had a future after Bon Scott.  This album is not only critical for fans of AC/DC, but those of rock n roll period.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I just have to say, upon first listen, this is the most amazing Wilco album... its beautiful, soulful, painful...  I loved Ghost and Yankee, but the soulfulness of these songs is just the ringing through factor.  Man, these songs make me cry... Got to get the deluxe edition and watch Jeff talk about how he has stripped back the songwriting, and some of the themes it is about.   I don't know what people are talking about saying \\"this record has to grow on you\\".  Maybe I just like slow mellow stuff... I dunno.  I just feel ever note of this album.  You be the judge.  Thanks Jeff and co. for making great music.  Music saves lives. Can't wait to see you this summer.  [...]
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Awesome CD from beginning to end.  The sound of this album goes back to the Rust In Peace and Peace Sells era, and what a line-up! The guitars are heavy along with the bass and the drums will definately make your speakers thump! It's a shame that all of these new so called rock bands coming out can't sound this good.  Maybe that's why I stick to the \\"old school\\" metal.  Metallica should pay close attention to Mr. Mustane because he will take them to school and remind them how metal is supposed to sound!!!! Crank it up!
1577314808|5.0|Having been a \\"seeker\\" for 25 years, read hundreds of \\"spiritual books and attended countless workshops and seminars I read this book 8 years ago and was profoundly effected by it. I've also had the good fortune of being with Eckhart several times and found him to be a teacher of the rarest kind, that is, actually living in and from the state he talks about. This for me is the most important spiritual book of the past 20 years.

0060832819|4.0|The Zahir was the first book by Coelho that I read.  A friend of mine lent it to me on a road trip, and I found myself not able to put it down.  This novel was like stepping into a familiar life, as he provides all the details that you need to know.  The book drew me in, and the story of the missing wife and her searching husband was good.  My heart broke for the main character, who, through finding himself, solves the mystery of what happened.  I promist you that you will not be able to stop reading this one.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|man this cd is kick azz from start to finish. i would give it a 6 if i could. All of there cd's are good but this one is great.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I was always a huge fan of Linkin Park. I loved Hybrid Theory and Meteora and even went to their concert in Texas, which was great. But dude, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED IN THE NEW CD? They turned into some emo band like Fallout Boy or something. There are only 2 songs I like: \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"No More Sorrows\\". It's hard to listen to other songs and I'm really disappointed; therefore I believe it's a waste of money to buy this album and I regret. Next time just download or buy those 2 or 3 good songs because the rest just SUCKS.   I ask myself; why would Linkin Park totally change the style that made them so famous and loved by the public? Just don't buy it because you'll be disapointed. Students from the college I go to can make a better CD than this.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|i love this movie so i just needed a new copy and its newer.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I can't believe it says they wrote over 150 songs for this album.  I wonder how bad the other 135 were.  When I first heard the album I thought they put the wrong cd in the case because it sounded like a high-school band. <br /> <br />There is nothing \\"grown\\" up about this album.
B0000DDAU9|3.0|this one is a 3.5 i like it but the other by these guys are better.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I'm not a Nu-metal junkie.  LP is the only Nu-metal band I own CD's of.  I love HT and Meteora, they're great to workout to and have strong driving music.  This album sounds like a CW television series soundtrack.  Don't buy this POS!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|first off this is not where im at in music right know but that doesnt mean that it sucks. I just listen to this cd three times in a row. I read online that this album was way softer than anything they have done as a whole, but i like my december and that song is old as hell like before hybrid theory came out. And for all those who judge so quickly maybe you arent as big of a fan of this band than you thought, no big deal becuase i not the biggest by far but they do have good cds and they rock live, and the live show to me makes all the difference. Its sad to say but there will be a lot of people who buy this cd just because its LP and not because they like it. I give it 3.5 right know could change later.
B000P7V45S|5.0|The release of these remasters could not have been much more confusing - there are three versions of each of the 5 Genesis re-releases. I have a SACD player, and purchased the European import version of this CD for about $5 more; the only difference is a SACD layer (with stereo and surround) on the CD. There is also a UK SACD version that uses a PAL format on the DVD instead of NTSC. I thought that the European SACD version was worth it; the sound is excellent. However, I must admit that the DTS 96/24 surround mix (on the second DVD disc in every version) is also quite good, and if you do not have an SACD player and do not intend to get one, save your money and buy this US edition. You are getting a remastered CD, a Dolby Digital surround version and a DTS surround version, as well as a number of DVD extras including recently recorded comments on the original album by the members of the band, along with some filmed live versions of Genesis material from a tour circa 1976. Really, it is well worth the purchase price, and if you are a die hard fan, there is a box set available with the first five post Peter Gabriel releases. All are equally well-done.     I would argue that the SACD (absent from this US edition) sounds crisper and slightly more detailed. However, the DTS version has a \\"fuller\\" or \\"fat\\" sound that is quite nice on the heavier songs like \\"Squonk.\\" All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the DTS versions, and the graphics on the screen during the songs (which show the album cover, song titles and credits) are nice as well. Depending on your equipment, you might not even be able to tell the difference between SACD and DTS. There is no question that the DTS version sounds better than the standard CD. And, even the CD sounds a little better that the origninal \\"Definitive Edition Remaster Series.\\" The Dolby Digital, to me, sounds a little harsh. The bottom line, I suppose, is that if you don't have a SACD player, this is the version to get. If you do havea SACD player, you have a decision to make - personally, I think that the extra $ for the SACD is worth it, but it is a close call.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Sorry, I really enjoyed Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but this is just a poor effort for such a talented band. I had expectations like anyone else, but this is so below what LP is capable of.
B0007O38XU|4.0|\\"Spaceballs\\" is a sci-fi spoof that reserves some fair ribbing for the Star Wars franchise. With the comic genius of Mel Brooks, \\"Spaceballs\\" reduced me to choking attempts to sustain life while blowing popcorn from orifices that I would rather not mention.<br /><br />The great comic acting from the likes of John Candy, Bill Pullman, Mel Brooks and Rick Moranis made the movie something special. It is a great laugh, though nothing high-brow. It is a spoof through and through, and it does that very well.<br /><br />Dark Helmet (Moranis) really steals the show. Scenes such as that where he is acting out sordid fantasies with some action figures, or when he orders the ship to \\"ludicrous speed\\", really make the movie. Moranis was surprisingly good in that role, making Dark Helmet seem like a vindictive 7-year-old. I loved him.<br /><br />\\"Spaceballs\\" is a great laugh, both for the verbal and visual humour, (the huge ship's bumper sticker: \\"We Brake for No One\\"). Overall, an awesome spoof and one of the best spoofs I have seen in ages. I loved it and have watched it many a time.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Like everyone else here I didn't like this upon first listen and was expecting more of a heavier album so I was in shock when I heard all these soft songs but I gave it a chance and its not that bad.  I've had this since May 5 so that gave me 10 days to review this cd you can't judge it by first listen.  Most of these reviews are people who heard that this album was bad but not actually sitting down to listen to it.  Now if this was another Hybrid Theory or another Meteora people would still be complaining because \\"LP hasn't changed there sound in the past 7 years.\\"  There are some Meteora moments on this record Given Up, No More sorrow, Bleed It Out, Hands Held High(nobody's listening comes to mind).  There are some really good ballads on here like Shadow of the Day, + Leave Out All the Rest.  However I think that The Little Things Give You Away is the best album closing LP has ever done and the most experimental to date, love the guitar work on this one another classic.  So please don't give this 1 stars unless you actually listen to this album from start to finish.  FYI:  This album has been leaked since May 4th, all other leaks before them are fake be careful what you download from torrent sites.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This album blows! It totally failed any expecatations I had about this much anticipated album.  It's full of touchy feely ballads. not one song got my adreneline going. You would be better off ripping mp3.s from a friends copy than actually spending your hard earned $$ on this one. I hope this is a wake up call for Linkin Park to produce a better album next time if there is a next time.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|When I First Heard That Rick Ruben Was Behind This CD I Got Really Excited, With All His Work With Slipknot, Jay-Z, And Countless Other Bands I Though This Would Have Been Old School Rockin LP But No.  They Change There Style For The Worst, When Some Bands Change Style It Can Be Refreshing And A Good Thing But Not With These Guys.  This Is One Of The Biggest Flops I Have Ever Heard, The Days Of Headbanging And Mosh Pits Are Over Traded In For Slow Garbage.  It Is Not Even Worth Time To Sample It, Find Some Sucker That Has It And Laugh At Him For Making Such A Bad Mistake Like I Did.  When They Go On Tour This Summer You Will Not Hear One Song Off This CD, Maybe The Single Because That Is The Hardest Song On Here.  I Feel Your Pain Die Hard LP Fans, Let Hope They Never Repeat This Sound, EVER.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Just great to have old classics redone with modern twists! Hopefully a Melbourne DVD will be next. A great add to any collection. AMAZING Bella Donna studio footage I could have watched for hours. Commentary very insightful and funny and gives a great glimpse into Stevie's thoughts and humor.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I am a real fan of heavy metal music. LP is usually not heavy metal, but as for this album...  i think they get a little closer. i can't beleive reading all of these other reveiws that all they are doing is trashing LP. Yeah... it is different, but it is not bad at all, in fact, in my opinion, i think is just as good as the previous 2 releases. it is way more chester, by that i mean... way more screaming. but all in all i like it... i usually don't write reveiws, but come on LP fans, don't be so hard 'em for trying something different... especially when it works.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I enjoy this DVD even more than my toddler granddaughter.  Great music and story.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|At first listen, I was shocked. Surprised that half the songs were slow. But I listened to the album as a whole and loved it. They harness old-school Metallica on Given Up with the guitar work. Chester still screams, which I love. I love when he sings too. As he does on Shadow of the Day. This song will be huge, much in the vein of U2 or a Coldplay anthem. What song is most like other Linkin Park songs on there previous albums? Then listen to Leave Out All The Rest. Every song grabs you once given a chance. To say this album is a sell-out, you are musically retarded. To sell out would be to release the same album, which they have not. They have grown immensely musically and personally and you feel that. Hands held high is a total slam to our ignorant president. I liked Hybrid Theory, loved Meteora. And honestly, I did not know what they would do next, but they have shown how amazing they are once again. I honestly feel Linkin Park is the best band on earth. They are hard but also can sing a ballad. They may lose some fans but for sure will gain more diverse fans. All I can say is I will be listening to this for a long time.
B000002HEM|5.0|Any 10k maniacs fan will LOVE this CD. All their best songs in 1 pkg. <br />Defintely a good buy and great CD.
B000000OTY|3.0|Released in 1994, this comes from a concert in Italy from the tour to support Gabriel's Us CD.  It is 99 minutes long. <br /> <br />The sound quality on this CD is mediocre.  The dynamic range is a little muted.  The low end is flat.  And there is a fuzziness to the sound.  To really enjoy the sublties of the music, the sound quality really needed to be better. <br /> <br />The worst part about the sound is that the audience is mixed in way too loud.  Many intricate moments are overwhelmed by crowd noise.  There is no reason for this.  To get the crowd this loud, it is necessary to have microphones pointed at the audience, and then purposely mix it loud. <br /> <br />For the most part, Peter Gabriel's live music has not translated well to CD.  This was true when Gabriel was part of Genesis and it is true in his solo career.  Although it wasn't a better band, the Phil Collins led Genesis sounded much better on live records.  His only really good live album has been Plays Live.  <br /> <br />With Peter Gabriel, \\"you really had to be there\\".   There is a DVD of this concert, but unfortunately, it also has problems.  The sound quality isn't any better than this CD.  The filming of the concert was not that great.  But, the translation to DVD was horrible (the orginal VHS version is better).  The was a video/sync problem with the DVD leading to rumors that Gabriel lip synced this concert. <br /> <br />This is mostly a new, international band for Gabriel.  Only the great Tony Levin on bass remains from the earlier touring bands.  The group adds some interesting interpretations to the music. <br /> <br />In spite of the problems I mention with this album, there are still some fantastic tracks like, In Your Eyes (the best version I have heard...I have heard many), Kiss that Frog and Shaking the Tree. <br /> <br />I found that some of the hits, such as Sledgehammer and Solsbury Hill are just boring and tedious on this CD.  Again this is probably the case where the songs weremuch more enjoyable in the live environment where you can see the stage show. <br /> <br />There are some great moments on this CD and it is probably worth buying if you a Gabriel fan.  It just isn't perfect throughout as you would expect from Gabriel.  A good quality DVD would be a better choice if it were available.  You may want to go for the DVD anyway.
0321146530|5.0|While I have only read half of this book, what I have read has been extraordinarily useful. <br /> <br />Years ago I attempted TDD with mixed success.  It was very interesting and I liked having the enforcement of quality control but found it cumbersome.  This book, however, has removed my reservations about TDD.  Regardless of how simple the concept of TDD, its practice takes some finesse, which this book helps to provide. <br /> <br />The examples are quite effective at demonstrating where the traps are and how to avoid them.  His appendix also includes a very simple example that is a simple explanation to give a taste to someone who is considering the technique. <br /> <br />The examples show not only how to do things correctly but also how to recover when you make a mistake.  This practice provides both information about recovery and why certain practices are good, such as only writing new code when there is a single red light and only improving code when all the lights are green.  <br /> <br />Finally, the book was very enjoyable.  Kent uses a humorous, self-effacing style that illustrates thought processes, both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\".  It kept me completely engaged for the first eight chapters or so (before life interrupted my enjoyment of the book).  It does tend to get more technical after that but I just see that as speaking to all levels of TDD practitioners - beginners to experts. <br /> <br />If you are thinking about using TDD, this book will convince you.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Best Count Dracula I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Kinski is a marvel, in fact, the entire cast is spot-on perfect. Direction and writing, cinematography...just about flawless--and this is praise from someone who was never a huge fan of Dracula to begin with. A friend suggested I see it, and am glad I did. <br /> <br />Better than Bela, than Lee, than Peter Cushing, et al... Kinski is the man. Some talent. <br />R.I.P.
B00005JPFH|4.0|This being the third in a series, Spiderman 3 has really created a lot of buzz, and criticism, and continues to break box office records.  I movie was good, but I'll admit it was slower at the beginning, and it was hard to figure out how they would tie the whole thing together, but the did a fair job, and of course left it open for another film. I guess their is a plan to do 5 movies total.  So, as expected, this being the third movie, the plot may be slower, but hopefully it will be a good building block for 4,5, and 6 (planned so far).   3 villans was a bit much, Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin-harry osbourne, but agian it was tied together at the end. I did feel this was a bit more violent than the other 2 films, so parents, i would watch this first before having the kids see it.  So for those who are worried about all the criticism, think of it in similar terms as the star wars trilogy, they have been out for many years, and millions of different answer are around at which one is the best, but together they are a film dynesty that will live on forever regardless of the pieces.  Spiderman will be the same, so think of this as another piece in the set, awaiting completion.   Must see in theaters, definitely will be on the shelf when able to purchase.
0385486804|4.0|Solitude. Wilderness. Adventure. These are the things a twenty-four year old man seeks in Jon Krakaur's biography of Chris Mc Candless. His book, Into the Wild, explores the mysterious individual, renaming himself Alex Supertramp, who left a well-to-do family and bright future to explore the depths of Alaska's wilderness. He gives his savings to charity, leaves all possessions behind, buys a ten-pound bag of rice and a small rifle, and lands himself in Alaska, foraging for food and living off the land. In the April of 1992, he leaves his home in Washington, D.C., his mother, father, and sister and is found by moose hunters as a decomposed corpse weighing sixty-seven pounds four months later. What happened in these four months? Krakauer interviews McCandless' family members and people Chris had met in his journeys. This chilling account of a man driven by adventure and the ultimate search of raw nature will force you to understand the strange workings of the human brain.  <br /> Jon Krakauer tells this account in a truly unique fashion. The first third of the book is devoted to explaining the early years of McCandless' life. Chris had a bright future in front of him, yet he chose to shed his life and begin anew. As the book progresses, Krakauer begins to compare McCandless to several individuals as well as comment on readers' ranging opinions. He disagrees with readers who state McCandless is a reckless individual seeking a death wish. He writes: \\"McCandless didn't conform particularly well to the bush-casualty stereotype. Although he was rash, untutored in the ways of the backcountry, and incautious to the point of foolhardiness, he wasn't incompetent...he wasn't a sociopath, he wasn't an outcast. McCandless was something else--although precisely what is hard to say. A pilgrim, perhaps.\\"  <br /> Chris McCandless' life is remarkable and unsettling at the same time. He was plagued by the expectations of society and his parents. Roaming Alaska sounded like the long lost paradise his soul was waiting to explore. He wanted to separate from established civilization as much as he could, often resulting in scrounging for food and work. This book highly appeals to those who love reading mysteries steeped in sadness. I found this biography to be compelling and a quick page-turner. While Krakauer's description is fascinating, the narrative midway through the story feels like a side trip. This part compares McCandless to several similar characters from history. In addition, he compares his own experiences to those of Chris. Interest in the finish of McCandless' story motivated me to read through this vaguely interesting bit. Readers who managed to pass through will be greeted by an astounding conclusion and heartbreaking finale of a youth's life cut short by tragedy and mistake.  <br /> This book will leave serious questions and contemplations swirling in your mind long after you finish it. Why would a man be motivated to take such actions? What causes someone to just pack up and leave his family after twenty-four years? It is only guesses and theories that can possibly grasp what McCandless did. Though a disputed character, he is a haunting person. Krakaur's biography of Chris McCandless is mind-blowing, genuine, and deep, as are the mysteries that plagued his mind.  <br />
B000H5TVKI|4.0|Great movie, Stallone's best movie next to Rocky.  The only thing that was kinda disapointing is the video quality of this Blu-ray version. <br /> <br />First Blood looks only slightly beter on Blu-ray than DVD.  So close that I even Beleive most average joes and not enthusiasts like me would not be able to tell the diffrence.   <br /> <br />There are not many extras either.  However this is the trend for up and comming media formats. However if you were to watch new release movies on Blu-ray instead of a re-release. The HD quality will blow your mind.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately First Blood is a Re-Release.
B00005JPO8|5.0|This masterpiece movie does not only apply to East Germany. It also applies to half of the globe's nations where intelligence services play a dominant role at all levels. For those familiar with Arab countries, the East German Stasi was responsible for the training and organization of the secret police of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Syria's Hafez Assad and many other nations ruled by tyrants.<br /><br />Yet in East Germany, dictatorship fell because members of the Stasi themselves were not willing to further tolerate tyranny. In The Lives of Others, Gerd Weisler (Ulrich Muhe) plays the role of an East German Stasi drone. The setting of the movie shows him as a German who loves his country and serves it in his capacity as an intelligence officer. When one of his missions landed on artist Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), Weisler was exposed to the hypocrisy of the system he serves and accordingly changed course.<br /><br />Of particular importance to Arab viewers is the character of the good-willed Stasi officer, compared to the Arab intelligence officers, most of who are simply malicious and opportunistic. The German drone was honorable enough to take the side he felt was right. When the Berlin Wall fell, he did not join any insurgency (as is the case with many Iraqi intelligence people) but was rather settled for a low profile job. Perhaps that's why tyranny in Eastern Germany fell overnight and without a single drop of blood spilled while dictatorships of the Middle East cause much pain and bloodshed whenever they are forced out.
0446677450|2.0|I will say now that I don't own the book but borrowed it from a friend. I can say that Kiyosaki gets you thinking and does have some good advice but most of the book is pure fluff. You finish it with the mindset of enthusiasm but with no real ideas on where to start.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, Kiyosaki's stories are full of holes and his Rich Dad may have never existed. By his list of books you can see his way of making money is capitalizing on everyone buying his books. His main teaching method is getting you to fail so you can learn from your own mistakes. You definetly do not need his books for this. <br /> <br />Lastly, if you simply visit the Wiki page on Kiyosaki you basically get all the information his books give you without the excess rambling and filler.  <br /> <br />To sum it up his ideas are good but no where near complete. I'd look into a good investment book (Ben Graham) and a good \\"Start You Own Business\\" book instead. Or better yet, sell your own stories (true or not) in book form and get to where Kiyosaki is now. He reminds me of those Saturday/Sunday morning \\"Get Rich Buying and Selling Real Estate\\" guys. They are making their money from you buying their garbage not real estate although that's not to say it can't be done.
B000654OUG|5.0|Schubert was a phenomenal composer. This set of CD's is now one of my most treasured possessions. His last sonata is almost 45 min long, an epic peice. Not for one second does Uchida's playing slow; she holds you completely engrossed in music so beautiful.  <br /> <br />The sound quality is superb, the playing dense in personality and detail. As the previous reviewer mentioned, anyone interested in the piano, Uchida or Schubert this is a must have masterpeice.

B000NA77YO|3.0|I was very let down by this album. I was planning to go see the concert after I bought the album, but changed my mind after listening to it. The older Dio Sabbath on it is great, but also available on Heaven and Hell or The Mob Rules,which in my opinion are the best 2 Sabbath albums ever produced. This new stuff is a far cry from that. Its really lacking in the guitar parts, muddled in my opinion.It could use more solos and some clarity. The singing by Ronnie James Dio is mediocre at best,he sure isnt the Dio of the late 80s, but you have to give them credit for trying. At least they touring and putting out new albums. <br />
0684843749|3.0|I bought this book because I'm a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and I was looking for a comprehensive body building book that would exhaustively cover all kinds of weight lifting exercises and techniques, muscle group science, nutrition, and other factors that need to be considered when developing a personal strength and fitness program. This book is quite thick, and it has a lot of great information, but it didn't go down to the level of detail that I expected from a book this size. I liked the fact that it has lots of pictures and it does touch on a variety of topics beyond lifting weights. There are sections on nutrition, competing, posing, and so forth. What I didn't like is the lack of detail, and the amount of space that was used to talk about posing, tanning, and competing. If you are a competitive body builder, it's probably good to know about this stuff, but for most guys in the gym just trying to find what plan works for them and how to grow muscle and stay trim, most of this information is quite useless. I would have liked to see more exercises discussed. I know that there are a lot more exercise out there that were not discussed in the book. I would have liked to read Arnold's take on them all. Overall, I'd say for the money it's a good book and worth having in your library. However, because it lacks great detail, it should be the only fitness book you own.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My five year old received this for his birthday.  It's a bit too sophisticated for him, but it is currently my favorite game. I find it challenging, interesting, and quick.  It is wonderful for developing spatial thinking.  Take heed--however--there are lots of small pieces (all are essential) which can easily get lost.
B000H30B2C|5.0|This movie has eccellent scenes that were added to it that was left on the cutting room floor . There were more spooky scenes with dinosaurs not on the first Peter Jackson King Kong version . I would have been able to sit through four hours in a theater .
B000MNP2KI|3.0|For once James Bond appears to be modern. A character who has spent most of his existence with a wooden, Ken doll personality finally, in the hands of Daniel Craig, has joined the rest of us in the year 2007. Of course Bond can never be as edgy as say, XXXX, Craig's character from \\"Layer Cake\\" the film that won him this most prestigious role. This is, after all, a franchise built upon a foundation of bling so anything the least bit offensive most be removed. And yet still they found a way to flesh this Bond out with humor and bravado. \\"Shaken not stirred\\" may have won them over many moons ago, but today our audiences demand more, they demand sexual innuendo with their ostentatious action set pieces. And Craig delivers, creating a Bond we can believe in, even when he is stealing cars and fornicating other people's girlfriends on the floor.<br /><br />At the center of this good, but not great, film is a poker game in Montenegro. We are back at the beginning of Bond's career (although the setting is modern day) and he is one of those shameless self-promoters who is looking to move up the ladder as quickly as possible. After an awe inspiring opening chase scene Bond is sent into the high stakes poker game (because he is the best, duh) with hopes of shutting down La Chiffre, a known terrorist. If he loses he has to live with himself knowing that he helped finance terrorism to the hefty tune of $10 million. Now poker isn't really my game so there is a chance that some of the nuisances of the game itself were lost on me. Stopping short of having an ESPN announce team in the house, Bond's co-conspirator Vesper works as the Greek Chorus filling in the poker simpletons (such as myself) and letting them know what is transpiring. \\"Rounders\\" made poker actually look exciting, but this film has no such trick up its sleeve. More than anything the central game works best as a way to slow down the pace of the film and in the process keeps it afloat.<br /><br />To watch this film back to back with the one that preceded it, \\"Die Another Day\\", would be to not believe that the came from the same genre much less the same series. Pierce Brosnan looked the park, especially when driving cars and acting cool, but I'm pretty sure I could beat him up. Daniel Craig would wipe the floor with me and that represents a major upgrade in that department. \\"Casino Royale\\" has its feet planted firmly on the ground and is helped along greatly by director Martin Campbell who can actually direct action sequences. \\"Die Another Day\\", with its embarrassment of a climax, was nothing more than special effects and fantasy lands, where somehow Bond ends up driving this uncrashable car through an ice palace. Oh, it is so bad. The old complaints about Bond refuse to go away however: plots are predictable, it doesn't have a thought in its head, and it represents commercialism above all. And still, for once, I am going to recommend a Bond film. It didn't give me whiplash and I am secure in the notion that Bond can once again clean my clock. What else does a man need? ***1/4back to back with the one that preceded it, \\"Die Another Day\\", would be to not believe that the came from the same genre much less the same series.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|You can only count the number of films like this on one finger of one hand. That other film could be on of many films starring Sir Michael Caine. Take your pick. From Zulu to Secondhand Lions. The scenes are long and in one take . The movie is riveting and you can not stop it until it is finished .
B000NA28I4|2.0|Most people, at least those who read books and watch movies, agree that usually the book is better than the movie that is based on it. Books are more interesting and principled whereas film only has the fun factor going for it. You can't have a blue CGI dragon in your book, for instance. Well, sad to say I found the book version of \\"Eragon\\" to be a mess, marred by a 12 year olds vocab and a cliche filled laundry list of fantasy book must haves. There are dragons and languages (mentioned but never developed) and arbitrary rules. It was also an overweight book made that way to in hopes of keeping with the tradition of that genre. Even sadder to say that the hypothesis holds true in this case as well as the movie version is an ever bigger mess. Only this time there are millions upon millions of dollars involved so everything had to feel safe and sanitized. In fact, it looks as though the makers were solely focused on making a decent looking dragon and that they ignored that whole plot thing so much that it resulted in a disturbingly dull and uninspired film. I'm sure they didn't care because people show up for the CGI dragons not the tale being told, and with this being a blue dragon and all I'm sure the producers slept easy at night dreaming of children lined around the block clutching their dollar bills and studio marketed merchandise. But then the movie opened, as movies tend to do, and it got trounced by Will Smith playing poor in \\"Pursuit of Happyness\\". Of course this film is terrible and deserves the shellacking it took but my concern lies with the rest of the trilogy they had promised us. I sincerely hope that the egg \\"Eragon\\" laid last winter won't be the end of \\"Eldest\\" and the subsequent sequel. Fox just needs to saddle up and make a better movie, then those kids will actually show up.<br /><br />The film is quite obviously trying to be \\"Lord of the Rings\\" for a smaller set. The story involves an impoverished people living under the boot of a ruthless king (yawn). One day a boy named Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds an egg which hatches the oh so famous blue dragon. Since the dragon, Saphira, becomes the hope of the proletariat the evil powers that be feel as though she must be killed. Jeremy Irons, good here but no miracle worker, is the town rabble rouser who sits in the town tavern and taunts the royal guards. Soon he joins forces with Eragon and Saphira to hunt down some young piece of meat who honestly nobody cares about. Eragon, like all kids these days, feels as though he can conquer the world just by mustering enough can do spirit. It is the type of mind set that lands people in the Middle East. The team travels the countryside dodging baddies and trying (and failing) to crack wise. It is all a pretext for some stupid battle that only exists to send the fan boys home happy. And really there is no reason this movie had to be so unwatchable, it is just poorly written and poorly directed. Plus Speleers acting won the movie no points either. He with his frozen face and forced delivery was plucked from who knows where for his ability to attract the Tiger Beat crowd, not his acting ability.  How do I know this? Well because near the end of the movie, for no good reason, he takes his shirt off and shows us some skin. Just what I had been hoping for. *3/4(yawn).

B000OCXMAE|3.0|This album was very dissapointing. After loving the first album I couldnt wait to hear Meteroa and it surpassed expectations. I went into this one the same way and it failed hard. There are a couple pretty good songs which is why I gave it 3 stars, but not nearly up to par with Linkin Park in the past. It's not as heavy, the Mike Shinoda rap songs are slow and non-interesting, and there are a couple political boring songs as well.  <br /> <br />Rick Rubin is a legendary producer and I respect him, but he really needs to stick with hip hop. Every time a rock band decides to go to Rick Rubin for their new album, it winds up being bad. The same thing happened to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Weezer for example. I don't know why they decided to go this direction but I can only hope that they go back to their old sound on their next one... too bad we're gonna have to wait another 2-3 years to find out...
B000OCXFCO|4.0|I've been a fan of Megadeth ever since Peace Sells, so I have the background of a fan who's listened to most of what these guys have to offer. I think it's an interesting exercise to compare what bands are currently doing to what they have done, to get some perspective. That said, I also feel that an album should stand on its own and be judged primarily on that basis. Well, this album can stand on its own two feet, let me tell you.<br /><br />We start with \\"Sleepwalker\\", a song that was available well in advance of the album's release from their Myspace page. It begins with a slow melodic intro, to lull you into a false sense of security perhaps. Then the bombastic crunchy riffage begins and builds up to a flurry of vintage thrash. What a return to form for Dave and co. Lyrically, the whole album is a bit more leaning towards the sociopathic and disillusioned than ever before. Check out the opening line, \\"I should be calling collect from jail for the things I commit each night in my head. Like last night in my sleep I got to snuff you then I woke up again, safe in my little bed.\\"<br /><br />From then on it just gets more interesting. My only criticism of the whole album is the inclusion of a lackluster version of \\"A Toute le Monde\\", though the female vocalist in the back half of the song was an interesting change. I don't believe they've ever used female vocals in any of their songs. Interesting, but not justified in my mind. We've heard this song before, and it sounded better. The album loses .5 stars because of this.<br /><br />Overall, however, I highly recommend this album. For your money you get heavy, fast, politically charged rants in the greatest Megadeth tradition. The production is great, and the musicianship is first rate. Glenn Drover's fluid legato solos (boy, are there a lot of them on this one) are a welcome change from Poland's work on TSHF. Not that I didn't like that album. I actually liked it a hell of a lot and it still gets frequent spins in my CD player. Still, something about it seemed a bit soulless, though it was a step in the right direction after Cryptic Writings, Risk, and the like. This album is like taking one step closer to the Megadeth we all know and love, yet it's new and fresh.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Megadeth, you'll buy this album and love it, most likely. If you're a fan of metal, you MIGHT buy this album, and I suspect you'll like it. If you're just on the fence- go for it. I honestly don't think you'll be disappointed.ing about it seemed a bit soulless, though it was a step in the right direction after Cryptic Writings, Risk, and the like.

1589269063|4.0|This is a great new perspective on relationships (spousal or otherwise).  If you can learn and commit to someone's love language, your marriage won't be perfect but it definitely helps!   <br /> <br />After reading the book (or listening to the CD), go to the website.  It's got great information. <br /> <br />
1400063515|3.0|His first book was better.  Simple thesis here, that one should expect surprises in life as well as in investing or trading securities.  In his first book I remember reading that the author resists editing, which both books cry out for.  He is talented and smart, but not a good writer.  He also exhibits an ample ego and rambles, so I cannot commend this book.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Just got my copy on iTunes and I'm disappointed for the most part.    I loved every second of Hybrid Theory and Meteora. I loved the heavy guitar riffs, the mix of rap + rock. This album lacks the heavyness that characterized its predecessors. Most of the tracks are soft. Gone is the Points of Authority style headbanging except maybe that guitar solo part of What I've Done. I'm not even talking the peaceful serenity of the Easier to Run or In the End intro segments. This is way softer than all that. If you remember jumping up and down to the LP songs of the old days, use these to put you to sleep at night.    What I've Done is probably the only track in the album that still sounds like the old LP. It's got that old feel that distinguished LP from any other rock band. Some other tracks show promise and hints of the old style that endeared LP to the masses of us that rushed to get Meteora, like the intro track (Wake), Bleed it Out, No More Sorrow. In Pieces is an OK track in light of the band's past work. Valentines Day has a decent heavier part near the end but is still quite light and soft overall. But if they did write 50 songs for this album, I wonder how the other 40 or so were like.    I'm still a big fan of LP and will continue to be, but I must admit that their intent to sound different did not produce good results. I hope with the next release they can go back to the old days. I feel kinda bad saying this, but unless you liked \\"What I've Done\\", you probably should wait for the next release.    Interpret my 3 star any way you like. The only reason it's a 3 star to me is I can't decide how low to go. Also, I figure that like one or two tracks I deemed unworthy on the predecessors, some of these tracks seem like they could just as well grow on me.    For the meantime, check out [[ASIN:B0013D8JYW End of Silence]] by RED if you haven't already. The blend of the entire band creates a similar style to LP as we know it without the rapping.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This 7th and last season of Gilmore girls may not contain the same number of crazy referances as the previous seasons (since creator and writer Amy and Daniel Palledino were not longer with it) but it is still a wonderful show that I will sorely miss next year. This is a crucial year with Lorieli getting married, and divorced, Rory getting ready to leave college and evaluating her relationship with long time boyfriend Logan, and all the other crazy characters being, well, crazy! Luke has a fist fight with Chris, Kirk seals himself in a clear box suspended above the street and Taylor breaks his leg, again. The banter may have dwindled a tad but it is still a brilliant show with fantastic actors. I really hope the WB/CW change their minds (or who ever's mind needs to be change) and bring it back for another year! I cried when I found out that this was the last season. It should stay!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|If you like Ray, you'll love this too. Better then his first outing of Trouble which really was hard to top.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I was anticipating this album for a while.  The sound of Linkin Park was so strong and they were the king of the rap rock era.  With the release of this album i was hoping for another strong disk in the realm of Hybrid Theory.  I was lookin for the hard riffs and sick rhymes.  This album however does not sound like the same band.  Jumping ship from the dieing rap rock genre Linkin park is trying to make a dashboard confessional album or somthing.  They are just trying to make the most money they can.  There gonna be mad when all people who show up to their concert will be middle school girls and whiney emo losers who probably took 3 hours beforehand to put on their eyeliner.  THIS CD IS GARBAGE.  What i've done is the best song on the cd which dosn't say much because i'm already sick of that one.  Is Mr. Han sill in the band? They should have changed their name before releasing this album so Linkin Park wouldn't be assosiated with it.  You got Mike whos at his lyrical prime right now and hes on only two songs? rediculous.  Pretty much this album could have saved mainstream rock music, but instead of being origional they are just following the crowd.  At the time i never thought i would miss raprock but now I'm learning it was the best music of my generation.  Any real Linkin Park fan will hate this album, but I will still be awaiting their next effort which will hopefully go back to their origional sound. Get the new chevelle or sevendust cds if you want some good new rock.
B000O178BY|2.0|I'm going to make this short, and true to the point in context. This album, is a flunk. Trent Reznor's tribute to himself on his own album. I have never heard the combination of I and God in the same sentence on any other album than a Creed multi-platinum hit.... and that is not a complementation to him at all. The lyrics of this album are at an all time dull low. About the only thing salvageable from this album has to be the instrumentals. If they kicked Reznor out of this CD, then it would be quite a piece, but yet he sing on...and on....and on. 2/5 because I appreciate ONLY the instrumentals. <br />

B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album kicks [...] from beginning to end. It is definitly the heaviest since 'Rust In Peace', But I feel it ties up with 'Countdown' and 'The World Needs A Hero' as well as 'System.' I've been a Megadeth fan since Rust In Peace came out so I like to think that I know what I'm talking about. 5 stars may be pushing it for some, but I take into consideration 'Cryptic Writings', 'Risk' and yes, 'Youthanasia'. You kids whose 1st Megadeth album was one of the 3 just mentioned and consider those albums one of Megadeth's best don't truly understand what being a Megadeth fan is all about. Granted the solos aren't as interesting as anything Marty has done with Megadeth. I don't agree with some of the political statements on this album, but I guarantee you it's perfect for our guys in Iraq. The war sucks and Bush is an idiot. Personally the song 'Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms' is my favorite, and just for the record 'Peace Sells...' has always been and still is my favorite Megadeth album. Thanks Dave, keep 'em comin'!
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The Pursuit of Happyness is based on the true life story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith), a bone density scanner salesman seeking to make a career change in 1981 to become a stockbroker. He pursues his dream in spite of his wife leaving him, and insists on custody of his son, Christopher. He finally lands an unpaid, six-month internship, where only one of twenty candidates will be offered a paying job. Every obstacle imaginable is in his path, but father and son will just have to prevail.<br /><br />I looked forward to seeing this movie with some trepidation. The title for one thing, had me on guard against the protaganist being some kind of misspelling apologist, and I am adamantly opposed to people of that kidney. Early on, however, I was disabused of that notion, and found instead that the central character was in fact, a correct spelling stickler. What a relief.<br /><br />He is also a fan of the poetic writing of Thomas Jefferson in The Declaration of Independence, and in voice-over ruminates on how Jefferson , in his wisdom, realized that perfect happiness might not ever be possible, but was something that nevertheless, all had a right to pursue.<br /><br />The other contributing factor to the aforementioned trepidation was that this retelling of the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches fable would be tedious drudgery. Too much hard work. This was not your usual Hollywood mindless entertainment, instant gratification for Live-For-The-Momentsters, but it was well worth the time and effort invested. Hard work, yes, but productive work that paid many dividends.<br /><br />In a promotional appearance on a talk show (probably Letterman, since I eschew Leno) with his real life son Jaden Smith in tow (who also plays his character's son in the film), Will Smith bragged about what a great actor his son was. He had even given him advice pertaining to his own acting that had greatly enhanced his performance. I was very skeptical of this claim, because of course he would be biased in his son's favor. But, after seeing the film, I would have to agree with him. His son did a great job walking that tight rope between being cute, but not so damn cute that it becomes annoying.<br /><br />A prime example of that is the kid who plays Bobby Jr. on the sitcom, All of Us: Khamani Griffin. In case you haven't seen it, the show was conceived and created by Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and is based on their own modern approach to raising kids with divorced parents, in evolving, caring relationships. Bobby Jr. is so repulsively cute that he would make anyone want to puke after watching him for five seconds. Surprisingly, that never happens in this movie, possibly because of the harrowing situations father and son goes through together.<br /><br />Will Smith did some great acting here as well. One scene in a Metro/BART terminal restroom was very moving. Homeless, he and his son are forced to sleep there, and he tries to make it an adventure. He is lugging one of his unsold bone density scanners, which he has rescued from a crazy street person who believed it was a time machine. He tells his son it really is a time machine, and when they press the button, pretends they are back in the time of dinosaurs, and the restroom is a cave. He cries actual tears here, and is totally believable. Another scene with a Rubik's Cube shows another side of his thespian skills, as well as evoking 1981. Another scene where he must interview for the stockbroker internship in paint splattered jeans was well done. Don't ask why. Parking tickets. If you have ever lived in San Francisco, you would know what that was like.<br /><br />In fact, San Francisco in 1981 was pretty much how it looked in this movie. Sometimes movies or TV Shows are set in San Francisco, but they get everything wrong. Like you know it was shot in LA, with just a few establishing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge thrown in, but totally in the wrong place. Suddenly Susan, Full House, Greg & Dharma--even Bullet, with Steve McQueen had him in the Tenderloin, and then on the next block, suddenly he was in The Marina. The crazy street person (John Robb) who thought his bone density scanner was a time machine was a bit jarring, like the tone suddenly shifted, and we were in a different, less realistic movie, or one of those stupid sitcoms, but since this was based on the real-life experience, I have no doubt that it probably happened exactly as depicted. All of the rest of the people were very believable, especially the stockbrokers. A friend of mine, who actually was a stockbroker intern during that same time and place concurred that it was pretty accurate.<br /><br />Finally, I was pretty excited when I saw the opening credits and found that Thandie Newton was in it, but she didn't have much to do as his wife but nag and eventually leave him. Oh, well. That is a pursuit for another movie, I suppose.an, Full House, Greg & Dharma--even Bullet, with Steve McQueen had him in the Tenderloin, and then on the next block, suddenly he was in The Marina.

B000G2YD3C|4.0|Influenced by bands like Pink Floyd (particularly their earliest works), Led Zeppelin, as well as The Beach Boys and The Cure for their vocal harmonies, and even modern day Tool and some grunge elements, The Dark Third is a challenging debut album by Pure Reason Revolution.<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"The Ambassadors of Morning\\", is a solid representative of the full album. It clocks in at a little over 12 minutes; blending numerous musical statements, from the Celtic folk parts to semi-electronic and analog synth work, to ambient atmospherics, to both male and female harmonies often sung in counterpoint, to classic rock guitar nuances. The song starts off with subtle keyboards while you can hear lots of sample sounds happening in the background. Far back in the mix, female vocalists hum wordless melodies before a heavier synth layer is introduced. This is followed by a very folky segment mixed with ambience and could make for a great movie soundtrack. The ambience generated by the keyboards is a testimony to the band's love for Pink Floyd. However, as the four-part harmonies kick off, the song turns into post-pop tune with great melodic sensibility. The multi-vocals take a back seat when the first chorus hits the tune with a very repetitive lyrical approach sung by deep, clean male vocals. Eventually the melody reaches its end and another lengthy instrumental section follows with lots of wind effects and sparse synth notes flying around. A grungy Tool can be felt before male and female vocals begin to sing in counterpoint and lead into the second big chorus that is repeated over and over until the last second of the piece.<br /><br />The other songs are also composed similarly, always injected with a multitude of similar sounds, but when put together, they form these easy-listening pieces which indicate a promising future for this band. The first song, \\"Aeropause\\", evokes Pink Floyd with its droning rhythm and slide guitar. Three members in the band play guitar, and that culminates in a wide-ranging sonic pulse, especially on \\"Apprentice of the Universe\\". Also, the \\"dreamy\\" feel of the whole album fits the concept. Obviously, the band is quite interested in the phenomen of dreams and their interpretation, and that feel is perfectly captured on the whole album. That said, the avid Floyd, Zeppelin or The Cure fans may question the songs' validity, and to an extent, they may have a point. It's great the band wants to mix all these genres, but doing it right is more important.<br /><br />The production done by Paul Northfield (Gentle Riant, Rush) is amazing; he's rendered an incredible sonic intensity on this album.tes in a wide-ranging sonic pulse, especially on \\"Apprentice of the Universe\\".

B000OCXMAE|1.0|I absolutely love linkin parks meteora and hybrid theory.  But unfortunately, this album isn't very good.  It's soft and somewhat calm.  Whatever happened to their loud music and angry rap?  that's what i loved about linkin park, and now, it's just not them anymore.  The only songs I actually like in this album is What I've Done and Given Up.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an AMAZING CD. Filled with songs ranging all the emotions. Idina Menzel carries her skill beyond the bohemian 11th street lot from RENT, into a powerful and skilled role as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. Combined with an all star cast of voices including Kristin Chenowith, and Norbert Leo Butz (Roger Davis in RENT); this soundtrack is a must hear for all ages.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is the second time I had purchased this Title.  The first one had anything but the original actors.  This one is the real deal and the movie is excellent.
B000O178BY|2.0|I can't believe this is a NIN album. I ended up liking one song off the whole album. I had high hopes for this album but maybe Trent should have chosen a different route. The overall base of the album is kind of silly in my opinion. I ended up throwing the album after listening to it. I have no idea where it is and don't even care. I hope this isn't what the future has in store for us with other albums, because that is what looks bleak.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Look, ive been a fan of Linkin park since day one, ive supported every single thing theyve done even that fort minor [...], but come on!! this is ridiculous, never has a band gone so pop and mainstream in the matter of one cd. There is maybe one good song on it, but wait no , there isn't, leave the politics to the politicians, if you want make political songs then hey be my guest, but dont expect me to listen, all i can say is that linkin park just lost A LOT of fans, including me. I hope this is the last time they attempt to change and be what they are not, which is a crappy band
B000NVIGC0|2.0|Say what you will about Wilco, but you certainly couldn't have ever accused them of being boring.  That ends with the release of \\"Sky Blue Sky\\".  Yes, it's a beautifully produced record.  It sounds like it was taken from a time capsule that was buried in 1972.  And that sound is consistent across every song on the album.  But cohesion is overrated.  At some point, the songs have to be there.  And with the exception of the gorgeous \\"Either Way\\" and \\"On And On And On\\", which bookend the album, \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" contains the dullest songs Wilco has ever written.  Songs like \\"Impossible Germany\\" start off interesting, only to then wander aimlessly and get lost in a sea of quiet guitar doodling.  Other songs like \\"Shake It Off\\" are just plain bad.  Nothing here will grab you. <br /> <br />Wilco was due for an album like this at some point.  You don't produce some of the most important music of the past decade without the occasional misstep.  \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is a mild hiccup in a otherwise spotless catalog, and you can bet Wilco will return with the kind of passion and vitality that is noticably absent this go round.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Everyone writes that they don't like this because it doesn't sould like the other albums. DUH!!!! They have been warning fans that Minutes to Midnight will have a whole new sound. From the second Given up starts spinning you know this is a new LP, a more mature LP, more hardcore. Give it a few spins to sink in. Some said Meteora wasn't very good, but after a few listens the album got better. Bands have to grow, people accuse them of selling out, I think they have done just opposite. If all they were concerned about was money this would have sounded like Hybrid Theory and Meteora. Instead they went in a new direction, took a chance, and instead of going for money they went for what was in their heart. So if you want the same old LP sound, don't buy, but if you want a more hardcore LP with more guitar, and less electronic Minutes to Midnight is for you.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Love this movie! The turbulent romance that still manages to surprise us in the end is on the same level as the all time classic of Pride and Prejudice. A must see if you love period pieces and BBC movies.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|On first listen I was turned off by Wilco's lack of ambition.  With each record they've pushed themselves to create something much different and daring than before.  This time it seemed as if Tweedy took a break from his bag of tricks and left us with a bunch of thin and unexciting songs. But man, by the sixth or seventh listen I was delighted to see these songs open up.  Tweedy's gift of melody and musical arrangements have never sounded better.  He's one of the modern day greats and this record prooves he could pull back the reigns a bit and still sound fresh.  Do not let up on this record.  You will be rewarded.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|As I am from Australia, the Supernatural DVDs didn't have special features, so I was excited when I got the American DVDs. It was awesome
B000MR9D5E|5.0|There are many documentaries out there especially nature ones but this is up there with the best of them such as [[ASIN:B000BI5KVA March of the Penguins (Full Screen Edition)]].  The viewer is shown footage while learning from narration through the legendary David Attenborough (the voice you think of when someone suggests making a wildlife documentary) about life existing in the most remote or harshest environments on earth.  Note a shortened version of this series was shown on the Discovery Channel with actress Sigourney Weaver replacing Attenborough reading the rewritten script (probably to cater to US audiences although if you read the other reviews on this site you'll see most of them prefer Attenborough too) but this DVD package is the original BBC version hour plus long chapters, with lifelong wildlife commentator David Attenborough.<br /><br />In some cases years of planning were needed to get permission to film in some areas and with the case of some of the footage in the chapter Caves, no more footage will ever be allowed to be filmed due to the fragile nature of the ecosystem within.<br /><br />As well as the general wildlife and plant information the best parts of the DVDs are the ten minute \\"making of\\" documentaries at the end of each chapter where you get to see the whole wider picture of the animal in relation to man today other than just the edited part which was in the documentary pretending no cameras were there.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys good documentaries, the Discovery Channel or is interested in the natural world will love these DVDs.

I can tell you, I have honestly acheived many spectacular things in the past few years because of his writings and inspiration. This book lays beside my bed and I read from it every single day, as I have many times. When I travel, so does the book. I honestly live my life by the success principles set forth in this book and have literally achieved things I previously thought impossible. I was so empowered by these principles, that I wrote all of them on the walls of my home office. (I was expressing my creative side) They are all displayed in bright colorful sharpie marker, along with my goals, affirmations, goal boards, and quotes. The energy from my office is AMAZING! In turn; my energy is high, I'm super productive, and successful!<br /><br />When I first encountered Jack's work, I was on a path less desireable to say the very least than I am today. All odds were stacked against me in ways unimaginable by most, and beyond the scope of this review. My point is buy this book!! Buy the Aladdin Factor!! BUY!!! The Secret! Buy all the Chicken Soup books. The principles Jack teaches allowed me to pull myself up by the bootstraps and enjoy an amazingly successful life and it can do the same for you!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I was actually in disbelief when I heard this album \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" I expected so much more out of LP since Hybrid Theory and Meteora. Alot of bands hurt themselves by changing the sound of their music in this case LP put themselves in the mode of self-destruction. No more hard hitting lyrics, powerful vocals, edgy chorus's, dj's and the days of rap rock are gone for LP. Rick Rubin is mostly to blame for the destruction of LP he ruined them like all the other bands he's produced. This album has no replay value what so ever you will get bored with every song on here. The only goods songs are Given Up, What I've Done and No More Sorrow, as for the other songs they are mostly slow songs and aren't very gripping. Alot of my friends bought this album and were disappointed with the outcome and refused to even listen to the album all the way through. LP may have lost the heat we can all hope that they find it again, until then I'll just listen to their old music.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Disclosure:  I did not rent this movie because I am a big fan of the futurama drama genre.  Normally, grim apocalyptic fables do not draw me because \\"bleak\\" and \\"depressing\\" don't constitute my idea of entertainment.  However, most bleak, depressing, apocalyptic fables do not star Clive Owen.  I would sit through the driest of actuarial company training videos if it were delivered by Mr. Owen, so I was willing to give this a try.  According to various rumor mills, Mr. Owen was either passed over for the role of 007 in \\"Casino Royale\\" or turned it down due to his commitment to this project.  He does good work as another kind of reluctant action hero here, and not unlike Bond, the fate of the world rests on the success of his mission.  Owen will not achieve Bond-like status on the basis of this movie or any other, but the autonomy to choose a wide range of disparate roles is its own reward.  With his trademark underplayed style of acting, he has been compared to such laconic American icons as Gary Cooper & Steve McQueen, but in this movie he reminded me of no one so much as James Stewart.  A similar Hitchcockian Everyman-in-a-bad-fix dynamic is at work as Owen's depressed protaganist Theo, made passive by drink and by the sorrowful events surrounding him, is suddenly thrust into action against his will and discovers the hero within. If you like shoot-em-up, crash 'em-up futuristic thrillers like \\"Mad Max\\" or \\"Blade Runner\\", you'll find plenty to like here.  Even if you don't, you won't be able to take your eyes off Clive.  Let's hope someone gives him a shot at comedy one of these days.  I think, like Stewart or Tom Hanks, he would excel at any role he tries.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Some people liked it, some didn't. I loved it. I thought it was very powerful and moving, the action scenes were amazingly done and after seeing it twice in theaters I knew I had to preorder it right away.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Anyone who is saying this cd sucks hasn't given it a chance. On May 4th when this cd leaked I skimmed through the cd quickly just to get an idea of what the cd sounds like as a whole. My first thoughts were they can't be serious with this crap. Hardly any rap and their sound has become more traditional rock. In comparison to Hybrid theory and Meteora I thought this cd sucked. Then I listened to it again because I've been waiting for this cd for so long that I was determined to find out what was going on with linkin park my favorite band forever. After the first time of listening to the entire cd all the way through, I instantly started to like it. The second time I was hooked. This is pretty much the only cd I have listened to for the last two weeks and it's still getting better everytime I listen to it. Out of all LP's albums, Minutes to Midnight has the deepest lyrics. While Hybrid theory and Meteora will forever hold a place in my heart Minutes to midnight will probably end up being my favorite out of all their albums. The band has matured and in a way that will turn off some classic linkin park fans. However, Whatever you do buy this album and listen to it all the way through and make your own judgment because no review is going to predict how you will react to this cd.  <br />The only problem I have with MtM is how the cd ends. Ending a linkin park cd with 4 slow tracks is a big mistake in my oppinion. I like all the tracks but this band is known way too much for their energy to end a cd with that many low tempo songs. While I love every song on this cd I would have really liked to have seen some more tracks considering how long it's been since Meteora. They could have at least included \\"qwerty\\" to balance out the slower tracks. However don't think this cd is all about ballads. It still has it's fair share of energy packed tracks. \\"Given up\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\" being my favorites.  <br />I consider Minutes to Midnight a perfect balance to it's more explosive brothers and a must own for any fan of Linkin Park. I beg you to just give it a chance and make sure you don't have a leaked version that came out before May 4th.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album is a great album if you just give it a chance to sink into you. Everyone on here is complaining that Linkin Park changed their sound for the worse. It is inevitable that a band changes their sound, you cannot expect a band to just pump out the same exact stuff year after year. People have branded Linkin Park as having a certain sound, but how long can they really sustain that sound and still be interesting, new, and different from what everyone else is doing. This album answers that question. The songs are very powerful and emotional and very deep once you listen to them. The album is just another stepping stone for Linkin Park and in my opinion, it is a step up.
0765316978|5.0|I'm more of a fantasy buff than a sci-fi fan, but I can and do cross over from time to time ... and a number of months ago, with nothing on my shelf to read, a friend recommended Old Man's War to me.  It took me about three chapters to become a fan of Scalzi's style.  A reviewer above compared Scalzi's books to Frank Herbert's Dune.  I couldn't disagree more.  While both are great, Dune was the ultimate in inaccesible Sci-Fi.  It required effort to the point of being painful to understand and enjoy, and even the most hardcore reader probably found themselves wearing a path to the back of the book, to remind themselves what the heck was going on. <br /> <br />Scalzi is the polar opposite.  His work is eminently accessible.  Not simplistic, by any stretch of the imagination, but technology and science becomes part of the story, and not the point of the story.  He understands, as do most of the great writers, that sci-fi or fantasy is simply a new way to tell an old story, and that the key is interesting, logical characters, and flowing dialogue.  Reading OMW, Ghost Brigades and now this was like reading an Elmore Leonard book in space. <br /> <br />There's really no point in writing reviews for this book ... if you've enjoyed OMW or Ghost Brigades, you'll love this one as well - so quit reading revies and order the book.
B00005JPCF|2.0|The trailer for this movie looked so cute!  I mean, come on!  Dancing and singing penguins?  So I put this movie down on my to-rent list.<br /><br />After I pushed play on my DVD player, I started finding faults from every corner.<br /><br />1.  Nicole Kidman is not convincing as a mother figure.  Every scene she was in, I kept thinking she is Satine from Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />2.  The story is not very fluid.  We go from Mumble's pre-birth to his birth fairly fluidly, but then we suddenly jump several years (probably months) rather rushed.  And how much time does he spend with the other penguins?  How long is he in the zoo?  None of this makes any sense.<br /><br />3.  The music and Lovelace are very sexualized for a child's movie.  I was appalled at some of the things coming from the character's mouths.<br /><br />4.  It was hard to appreciate Mumble's dancing because it was hard to see what his feet were doing.  If it wasn't for the tap dancing sound track, I wouldn't have known when Mumble was dancing or when he was running, jumping, or trying to find a bathroom.<br /><br />5.  At the end, how do all the penguins know how to dance?  I thought dancing was bad and singing was where you found your heartsong?  When did the penguins miraculously cultivate this talent?<br /><br />6.  The plot is rather unimpressive.  Poor Mumble has no Heartsong and has to convince others his Heartsong is his dancing and that is OK.  In the meantime, he must also save the penguins from starvation, knocking Lovelace from his spiritual pedestal, befriending dancing penguins from a remote part of the island, and winning the heart of his long-love.  Certain details are never brought back up again (i.e. the attacking birds, the seal, etc.).  And the ending?  Puhlease!<br /><br />7.  At the end of the movie, I just sat staring at the screen asking myself, \\"Is this it?\\"  How could something that looked so cute in a trailer be this tepid?  This show has been done, in parts, much better elsewhere.  Why did the producers think we needed another film with all these hodgepodge pieces mashed together like a bad salad?<br /><br />8.  It seems silly to me that the whole \\"humans are taking the fish away because they are over-fishing and polluting the earth\\" angle can pass.  Did anyone see how many Empire penguins alone there were?  Probably around 30 million--no wonder they are having food problems!  Anybody remotely familiar with biology or differential equations can tell you that is what is going to happen.  Food goes up, prey goes up, predators go up and kill more prey.  Food goes down, prey goes down, etc.  With this many penguins all competing for the same food source, it should be clear that humans aren't the only reason behind the food shortage.  The penguins are their own worse enemy.<br /><br />Not to sound overly negative, I liked Elijah Wood as Mumble and Hugh Jackman as his father (I never knew he could talk and sing like that!).  The animals were very realistic and adorable.  And the dancing was pretty cute (when and if you could see it).<br /><br />I walked in hoping for some laughs; I walked out feeling confused.  I am glad that I rented the film and had not watched it in the theater or bought it.  It was barely worth the time I spent watching it; it certainly wasn't worth the $20 or so buying it or the $10 or so seeing it on the big screen.eeded another film with all these hodgepodge pieces mashed together like a bad salad? <br />8.

B0000069DB|5.0|From the remote 1954 when Callas registered for EMI this Rossini's 'dramma buffo' I've never listened and enjoy an excellent version like this. Chailly delight from the podium and give it to the cast with a dazzling performance. Bartoli makes a beautiful Fiorilla with your charming voice and expressiveness; Corbelli with your voice and portrayal of the tortured Geronio is a fine comediant. Vargas, Pertusi and De Candia are all excellent, but one pleasant revelation is the Zaida of Laura Poverelli, great and enjoyable voice ant performance. The quality sound and balance of this London register are also very good. Essential recording for all opera lovers.
B000LPS47U|5.0|The latest release of \\"Re-animator\\" does actually contain elements of previous releases, stemming back to its initial laser-disc, extra-laden presentation in the 1990s.   <br /> <br />What is fetching in this latest release is a very comprehensive documentary, which subtly conveys Stuart Gordon's expertise as a director. Additionally, the transfer looks grander (and gorier) than ever before, and the unqiue packaging should be enticing to any horror-movie collector. <br /> <br />Indeed, if one has never purchased \\"Re-animator\\" before on DVD (or VHS/Laser Disc), this edition will prove quite mind-blowing. For those who have purchased the movie before (or who have simply viewed it many times over in the past), there is still enough new fringe offerings to make this entry a glorious catch, especially if one can obtain the highlighter/syringe collectible as part of the packaging. <br /> <br />\\"Re-animator\\" is an indisputable classic, and this particular special-edition is the ultimate to possess to date.

1400049628|4.0|This is the prequel, as it were, to Max Brooks' more recent zombie epic, [[ASIN:0307346609 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]].  In many ways, it's a tentative first step into the deep waters of the follow-up.  When it first came out, I saw it in a bookstore, and even though I was amused after perusing it a bit (yes, I peruse in public!) I still dismissed it as just another cheap knock off of [[ASIN:0811825558 The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook]], this time taken to ridiculous extremes.  After eventually reading the incredible WWZ, I just knew I had to go back to the source.<br /><br />The book's title pretty much tells you about the contents.  Written as a straight-faced guide, Brooks goes to great lengths to present this as non-fiction.  Even though a reader with a very acute irony meter might detect the hint of a wink, it's probably just your own reflection winking back at you, because Brooks is having none of it.  Sure, the \\"handbook\\" does occasionally dispense some maxims like \\"Be Prepared!\\" (complete with exclamation points), just like the most cornball of sirvivalist tomes. According to Brooks, though, there really is a virus named Solanum that can infect an unsespecting person, causing them to die and then \\"reanimate\\" into a ghoul that mindlessly feasts on the flesh of the living.  There really has been a long but hidden history of recorded zombie attacks throughout human history.  There really is a threat of a wider solanum outbreak that could potentially threaten not just the human race, but all life on earth.  Therefore, we're presented with detailed chapters about zombie physiology and behavior, weapons and defense and what to do in order to survive a full-scale outbreak.  This is all imagined to an insane level (though again, Brooks presents it as not just level-headed, but also common sense), and , truth be told, some of it might even be accurate in the event of a more likely catastrophe (e.g. large scale terrorist attacks).<br /><br />The final portion of the book is a chronicle of recorded zombie attacks, from 60,000 B.C. until 2002 A.D.  It's here that the groundwork for what would beocme \\"World War Z\\" is laid.  Once again, it's all presented as non-fiction reportage, even noting where many of the stories may be innacurate or hyperbolic.  One section (\\"1073 A.D. Jerusalem\\") briefly relates the \\"...story of Dr. Ibrahim Obeidallah, one of the most important pioneers in the field of zombie physiology...\\"  The good doctor apparently captured an undead specimen and was able to make detailed observations, before the city was captured by Christian invaders, he was put to death and his work suppressed (those damn Crusaders!).  The book may not be \\"laugh-out-loud\\" funny, but it at least guarantees a wry smile throughout.<br /><br />Side note: when I reviewed \\"World War Z\\" on Amazon awhile back, I decided to take Brooks at his word and proceded as if writing about a work of non-fiction, much to the puzzlement of my fellow shoppers, who awarded me with mostly \\"not helpful\\" votes.  I guess some people can't take a joke...> <br />The final portion of the book is a chronicle of recorded zombie attacks, from 60,000 B.C. until 2002 A.D.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Not since Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, have I enjoyed a show so much.  The characters are wonderfully played by Jared and Jensen.  In fact, the entire cast is top notch.  The episodes are well-written, funny, witty, and scary.  Season 2 has only gotten better.  I can't wait to see what happens next!
1400082773|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough.  It's a must for Obama fans, and a great read for anyone interested in racial identity development.  Obama's family history is intriguing and poignant, particularly because of its presentation from many different points of view.<br /><br />He paints such fascinating portraits of the people who have influenced him.  These portraits stay with me as I watch him on TV or read about him in the paper. They make me feel like I know him personally.<br /><br />Read this book if you are at all curious about Barack Obama, especially if you can't figure out why he is so appealing to so many people. You won't be disappointed.
B000286RKW|5.0|What a wonderful inspiring film-making by the only director who could possible make the film, the undisputed classic. The cast is superb, the pace - incredible; 145 minutes simply flew by. My beloved \\"Sopranos\\", all six seasons of it could fit perfectly like in a case in these 145 minutes. Ultra-violent, mesmerizing, enthralling, \\"GoodFellas\\" is an unforgettable wild ride. I have not seen the film for a while and what a great fun it was to re-watch it again and I know it always will be.<br /><br />Favorite scene - after Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) killed Billy Batts, they and Henry Hill stopped at Tommy's mother (Mrs. Scorsese) house. The contrast between earlier horrifying scene at the bar and the nice family dinner is simply breathtaking.

0140557741|4.0|This book was mentioned in another book I was reading and I was curious about it, so I ordered it.  Even though the title is \\"Zoom,\\" it seemed to be a \\"reverse\\" zoom to me, i.e., it had already zoomed and was now zooming out.  Regardless, I enjoyed the book for what it was and found the idea extremely creative.  When we're having a not-so-good day because little things are going wrong, looking at this book would be a good way to help us gain back our perspective.
1572705329|5.0|EMMA is a joyful read, made even more entertaining through Prunella Scales's vocalization of several characters and through her interpretation of the text.  Her complementary pace actually improves the listeners' appreciation of Austen's comedic plot.  Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales.
B000PY52EU|5.0|\\"Black Snake Moan\\" isn't a perfect movie. I am definitely not a fan of Justin Timerlake, as a singer or an actor. I find it weird that the makers of this film would really think Timberlake was the best person to play the part of Rae's boyfriend.<br /><br />For the most part, however, I find this movie enjoyable because it is differnt from what is normally available in the theatres. I only saw the director's last film, \\"Hustle & Flow,\\" after I saw \\"Black Snake Moan.\\" This guy definitely has a different way of looking at things, and I hope he does not let too many Talking Heads start making creative decisions for him as he crafts his films.<br /><br />For a movie with an unrealistic premise, I think that the conclusion of \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is very realistic. I feel that most people who view this will, at the very least, be entertained by a unique flick.
1400063515|3.0|There is a lot of great stuff in this book, and it's fun to read.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion of Mandelbrot and fractals, without being able to explain why.  It is rare that someone would tackle a topic like this, and it is clear that the rarity of discussion is related to the fact that this idea is not a very attractive meme.   <br /> <br />But besides that, here is the problem with the book.  It is long on problem and short (or vague) on solution.  I think that the anecdotal exposition of the problem wasted too much ink, because it is pretty intuitive to understand.  (I skipped pages 160 to 200 without missing anything). <br /> <br />Now when you get to the solution (or at least, the alternative approach), you get a fascinating description of fractals, but unfortunately, I don't think the book actually ties this approach in with the problem.  I can't see how anyone is going start a hedge fund based on Mandelbrot, but maybe that's the point.   <br /> <br />His real life approaches are actually more effective, but he brings them in too briefly.  Basically, he prescribes living with a lot of little failures in order to maximize the chance of a big win, while protecting against the big failures (in investing, for example).  We need more exposition on that. <br /> <br />His argument is basically that life is the only real game of chance, and it is probably impossible to compute or predict.  And I think he needs to spend more time saying, \\"But cheer up; it's not so bad (and this is why).\\"
B000NA28IE|2.0|I saw \\"Eragon\\" in the theatre.  While the concept was interesting, the execution somehow fell short.  If you haven't seen the film and you want to-just rent it.  Don't buy this film unless you have seen it and you want to keep it in your collection.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|If you gave this album anything less than a five, you probably bought the new linkin park, which was released the same day, and gave IT five stars.  I don't think Mustaine could have done a better job. period. <br />      For those of you who aren't stuck in the past, and think that everything has to sound like rust in peace to be Metal, don't be scared off by the comparisons.  Don't get me wrong, I love those albums, but this sounds nothing like any album Megadeth has ever done.  The closest is TWNAH, and even that's a reach.  It has a fresh, new, 2007 approach to what \\"metal\\" is all about. <br />      The album is full of hard, heavy, message-driven songs that sound like a collection of musical tantrums toward the world as we know it.  If you are looking for solos and heavy riffs, this thing is soaked in them.  The do-over of a tout le monde is just as powerful.  If you think you might be turned off by female vocals, just listen to bands like Nightwish and Lacuna Coil, and you'll have a better appreciation for what chicks bring to music.  Would you rather have Beyonce on this album? <br />      I could get into the high points and low points on the album, but after listening to it twice, I'm still trying to find something negative to say.  If you are any kind of fan of heavy metal music, do yourself a favor and get this album. Oh, and pick up some antibiotics too, cause this album is just plain SICK.   <br /> <br />   <br />
B000OCZ0ZO|4.0|About the packaged kit later.<br /><br />About the music:<br /><br />This CD is what I would call the equivalent of an acoustic or live CD. Less distorions, less electronic sounds, more hard guitar, more real instruments or real instrument samples.<br /><br />The band made over 100 starts of music for this CD, and chose these. Every song is well mastered. I respect an artists' choices of expression, and realize that people are not static-- they grow, change, learn, age and evolve. This is a perfect evolution. No jumping from monkeys to humans here, its easy to see how they got to this place. They said they intentionally tried to abandon everything that was \\"comfortable, easy and they'd done before\\". That's clear.<br /><br />Its clear here that LP has done what they wanted to do, and not what they \\"thought they should do\\". Yet they prove that they can still be what they were (track 2, example), and chose not to be that.  Bands typically take one of two routes-- replicating exactly what they've done to make more cash, or doing what they feel, to be a real artistic group.  They are being real artists here.<br /><br />I feel influences here that I haven't heard before-- Metallica, U2, Coldplay a bit, some NIN like beats in one spot, a small Blue October feel with some more calm introspective stuff that I haven't quite identified yet. It's all good. No bubble gum pop, no 80's hair band stuff. Some incredibly hard stuff, some very revealing stuff.<br /><br />I found myself liking the stuff that was most atypical because its like getting to see the other side of someone you feel like you know well. Deeper, different, and thought provoking.<br /><br />In this CD Chester is more able to do his thing. Shinoda is more able to do his thing as well.  Shinoda isn't limited to his 5 second hip hop responses to Chester's chrous. That's refreshing that each gets full time to do his respective thing.<br /><br />It was said that each member of the band contributed just as much as the others during the process of development of tracks, where previously it would be the Shinoda & Chester. It's clear that others had more input.<br /><br />I'd almost say this CD could be considered a \\"Prequel\\". I think had the band had the full freedom to do what they wanted, their first CD may have sounded like this.<br /><br />There is a marked uptick in the curse factor. I know how difficult it is to refrain from that, and with the first two instances I smiled and chuckled, becuase I had a great feeling of release for them. Be real and let it all out...<br /><br />I have only had it one day, so I'm refraining from making an outright \\"AWESOME!\\". It definitely doesn't suck, I wouldn't even call it mediocre. It's good. I just don't know if I've had enough time to discover how good it is.<br /><br />I don't like artists who sound exactly the same on every album. Those are the ones who get a single play, and get put away. I don't expect people to not evolve. Its like going back to your home town and expecting your old friends to be who they were \\"back then\\". \\"Back then\\" isn't anymore.<br /><br />The packaging:  Very _very_ nice book looking booklet with the DVD of PCM audio, interactive stuff for the PC including MP3's so you don't have to extract. Images, PDF of the album book internals. More.<br /><br />I always buy every LP CD, because I respect them as a group. They do their own artwork, and I really appreciate that as well. I take it in as their conveying an artistic message. I listen, chew it up, think about it.<br /><br />If you are one who listens to the words, you will definitely not be disappointed here. Lyrically, as good as ever.<br /><br />[edit in, a couple days later]<br /><br />I can't put the CD down.  I am really liking it, a LOT.  If I could change the 4 star to a 5, I would do so. I think a lot of people who have been reviewing the standard CD could really benefit from the video on the DVD about the making of the CD. It really makes it all make sense.<br /><br />The only additional comment, is that I still really like the new totally different introspective slower tracks. I also really like stuff like track 2. I wish they would have released a dual disc set here-- one CD of hard hard stuff, a CD of the introspective slower quieter stuff. That way, instead of a roller coaster of emotions, you can \\"get it out\\" whether you're feeling the need to rock, or to chill.<br /><br />I want more of those 100, soon.  I feel like I want to encourage them to really push the fringes with the house beats on a couple tracks, the slow almost beatless tracks, and the industrial beat/80's Police style beats mixed 50/50. Great stuff.e.<br /><br />The only additional comment, is that I still really like the new totally different introspective slower tracks. I also really like stuff like track 2.

0385333846|5.0|With the recent passing of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., which eerily coincided with the first day I was going to teach this novel to my class, it was difficult to re-read \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" without a lump in my throat. It always gave me that effect, but now, moreso. <br /> <br />This breakthrough novel of the late 1960s holds up incredibly well. One reason--out of many--is that Vonnegut's honesty and his very real sense of the loss of a once-great city (Dresden) rings through every page. I will resist discussing the plot, tempted as I may be. But what must be discussed is Vonnegut's tempering of dark satire with his very forgiving, human tone. Just when things get bleak, Vonnegut injects just the right amount of humor which has the added effect of heightening the tragedy, too.  <br /> <br />I can type until my fingers fall off about how marvelous and joyous this book is. And I will swear on whatever you want me to swear on this one truth: I have never had a student tell me that they didn't like this book. That's some testimonial coming from students who are not majoring in literature! <br /> <br />Rocco Dormarunno <br />College of New Rochelle
0393061434|4.0|I really Woz pleased with this purchase. The book was excellent, dispelling a myth or two about Apple, but really just giving a wonderful insight into the mind of Wozniak. Easy to read, easy to understand, getting just technical enough to push the envelope at one spot for the uninitiated without being boring. A great read.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I have only been a fan of Wilco for a little over a year now but when I got each album of theirs they always had a great deal of growth musically from album to album. I saw Wilco play live last year in Huntsville and they played 3 of the songs on this album that night. Is this album mellow? Yes. Is this album terrible? Hell No. The band has gone in a direction that let's the songs shine and the simplicity of these songs are what makes this album great. I read a comment made by Jeff Tweedy about this album where he said this time around he wanted to put songs on this album that you could put in your pocket and go. What does that mean? It means that this time around he wanted the songs to shine on their own and not have to worry about having a specific effect pedal or sound that went into playing the song live to recreate that sound off of the album. This is a great album and frankly there is not a bad song on here. I have not bought the cd for this album yet so I am not sure if the song Let's Not Get Carried Away is a hidden track on this album or not it is on the Itunes version Though. If it is not on the cd I suggest you download it because it was one of the songs that they have played on encore's in their last tours and it is a great song.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Nine Inch Nails have both enjoyed major success over the years.  Both bands have changed dramatically from their first album in the 80s to what they are now with Stadium Arcadium and Year Zero. Both bands have also put out a lot of great records.  Even their weakest albums were still great to listen to.  With RHCP, they started with sexually-charged funk metal/hard rock music in the 80s and early 90s and slowly evolved into a layed-back funk rock band with By The Way and Stadium Arcadium.  The Nine Inch Nails have been the main driving force of industrial music and each album they released has a distinct sound and style (all 5 major releases including the recent Year Zero).  However, a sudden change from one album to another can lead to a serious backlash (for example, Metallica moved away from thrash metal to radio-friendly hard rock/heavy metal songs on The Black Album, which was a major backlash to the band and remains as a diving point between Metallica's fanbase). <br /> <br />Now, Linkin Park has fallen victim to this.  Their new album Minutes to Midnight is a change away from the nu-metal sound, but a little too much.  Hybrid Theory and Meteora were known for angsty rap verses, screaming, and distorted guitar riffs with a mix of hip-hop and electronica.  On the new album, the rapping is down to just two songs. The screaming can only be heard on a few tracks (will be discussed below).  And the lyrics are much more maturer, even a few politcally charged songs.  The problem is the album is much more soft than their previous efforts.  A lot of songs are ballads and Mr. Hahn does not use his signature turntabling he's done on HT and Meteora. <br /> <br />Anyways, a runthrough of all 12 songs: <br /> <br />1. Wake <br />--This is the introduction to the album.  It is an instrumental that sets the tone for the album.  However, when compared to their other 2 instrumentals (A Cure for the Itch, Session), this song just doesn't give acatchy and interesting feel to the song.  6/10 <br /> <br />2. Given Up <br />--This song is similar to their past works on HT and Meteora, only the style is different.  Compared to most of their works with HT/Meteora, the song can be described as faster-paced along with the well known distorted guitar sounds.  One of the best on the album 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Leave Out All The Rest <br />--This IMO, might be the song that picks up young bandwagoners in the same fashion as Boulevard of Broken Dreams did for Green Day.  This is the first ballad on the album, and feels like a pop song rather than the rock we are all familar with.  The song isn't bad though with maybe better lyricism than previous albums, but as an LP song, it's just ok.  7/10 <br /> <br />4. Bleed It Out <br />--This is one of the only 2 rap songs on the album.  The lyrics are more comparable though to Mike Shinoda's work with Fort Minor.  The song can be described as a classic rock/AC-DC syled riff with Motown drums, as stated by the bands.  The song sounds like something that can be played at a sports arena with the clapping and catchy rhythm.  Not too bad....8/10 <br /> <br />5. Shadow Of The Day <br />--The first thing that will come to mind on this track is the similarity with U2's With or Without You.  This is also another pop rock song, but probably one of the best on the album.  The song might be about a U.S. soldier leaving for war.  10/10 <br /> <br />6. What I've Done <br />--We've heard this song for over a month now on the radios.  This can be described as a standard alternative rock song, kind of like Breaking the Habit.  Mr. Hahn's presence can be felt in the song.  The song is a reflection on how the band has changed.  Watch the music video too.  My only problem is the song is a little too short.  I would like to have heard longer verses or a longer instrumental portion after the second verse.  9/10 <br /> <br />7. Hands Held High <br />--Interesting, I should say.  This is a Fort Minor-styled rap song with politcally charged lyrics.  You can hear marching drums in the song, kind of like Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers.  The refrain though...was kind of lazy...AMEN AMEN AMEN...I think they should have after the AMENS, added in the ending chorus \\"With Hands Held High...\\" at the end and as the full chorus. 6/10 <br /> <br />8. No More Sorrow <br />--This is followed by another politically charged song.  The song used the E-Bow from Brad Delson and has a lengthy introduction along with the hard rock guitaring.  The instrumentation in the song sounds like it would work well for a military-based video game.  The lyrics are clearly an attack on George Bush and his war on Iraq.  This is easily the best song on the album.  10/10 <br /> <br />9. Valentine's Day <br />--Another ballad, and this one is quite forgettable.  In fact, I think this could be LP's worst song.  The song starts up slow with some electronic elements and ends loud with the song title \\"On a Valentine's Day\\".  I just didn't enjoy it and honestly, I think it's one I will skip.  2/10 <br /> <br />10. In Between <br />--Well, Mike Shinoda instead of rapping, sings on this track.  In Between is another electronic ballad sounding kind of like the Postal Service.  It's interesting to hear Mike singing, and maybe we can look forward to more of it on the later albums, but other than that, it's just an average song.  7/10 <br /> <br />11. In Pieces <br />--Yet another soft ballad, but like Valentine's Day, it progressively gets loud.  Once again, it starts like an electronic-Postal Service styled song, but at the second verse, you can hear a reggae/ska styled beat as the songs feels like it is getting faster.  Eventually, Delson puts in a nice guitar solo near the end.  The song might be regarding one of Chester Bennington's failed relationships between Meteora and Minutes to Midnight. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. The Little Things Give You Away   <br />--The last song really shows how far Linkin Park has come since Hybrid Theory.  The song is their longest work to date, running for over 6 minutes.  It's an alternative rock song that has the feel of an older mellow alternative rock song.  The song might deal with the events of Hurricane Katrina.  The song really builds to it's peak halfway through with a slow but moving guitar solo by Brad Delson and the vocals near the end.  Mr. Hahn also has a role with sampling on this track too.  Another favorite from this album. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, LP has made a lot of changes from their previous album, but I think LP should have worked more on keeping the rap and some elements of their past work.  Remember QWERTY?  The major issue was there was too many ballads and a stride towards more pop-rock/synth rock and a move away from hard rock/alternative metal.  A lot of people will be dissapointed with this album, but overall, just like with Metallica's Black Album and Green Day's American Idiot, it is still a decent album worth listening to, but I prefer for new LP listeners to start with Meteora and Hybrid Theory instead.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth is back with their 2nd great album in a row!  I liked TSHF and this is even better! Like a lot of reviewers have already mentioned this album has even more of an old school thrash feel. And while it's not RIP II it's the closest they have come heaviness wise since.  <br /> <br />'Sleepwalker' and 'Burnt Ice' are just sick as well as all the solo's just ripping all over the place! I love it. I am so impressed by Glen's lead playing. While he may not be the player Friedman is he is wasting anything Marty ever did after 'RIP' Well maybe since 'Youth' you get the point. The Drover brother's are the kick a#@ bandmates Dave needed.  No disrespect to the other very talented band members prior but talent alone doesn't make good albums.  The Drover's, like Dave, eat, live, and sleep, real metal and you can hear that in the whole attidute of this album! <br /> <br />Some other killer tracks are 'United Abominations', 'Gears of War', and 'Blessed are the Dead' though every song on this album is at very least good to great. <br /> <br />Using Andy Sneap to mix the album was another wise move.  This is the best sounding album production wise Megadeth have ever had.  The sound is perfect, crushingly heavy and crystal clear! <br />   <br />UA is the album I was hoping for from Megadeth for a long time. I am not one of those fans that expects RIP again cause I know it will never happen. I just expect Megadeth to play the metal/thrash style of music they are supposed to.  And now with this new album along with TSHF they are doing just that. <br /> <br />Thank's Dave for all of the great metal music over the years!! <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|'Casino Royale' is the best bond in ages.  The writing is crisp, the direction is top-notch, the music is great, the action is exciting, the music (score and theme) are well suited to the movie and great listening, and the acting is fine. <br /> <br />In particular, Daniel Craig is well suited for the role:  he's conveys a seriousness to Bond that Brosnan was lacking, without being dour like Dalton.  His screen presence is commanding, and you believe it when he's in the action sequences.  All the other players do a great job, although I wasn't too keen on Vesper, but not much. <br /> <br />The action is exciting, and believable, and not over the top or too excessive.  The introduction of Bond after the credits, in Africa, and the chase through Miami airport got all of us watching off the edge of our seats watching it on the DVD.  And the final action scene, in Italy, was also quite memorable. <br /> <br />The whole card game was a chance to take a rest (with, the exception of a small tussle with some enemies) and develop the characters more fully. <br /> <br />There were some surprising plot twists that didn't follow the usual Hollywood or Bond formula, and at times a bit complex.  I needed to watch a second time to figure out who's who. <br /> <br />This movie ranks up there with any Sean Connery movie and I hope that the producers return to this type of Bond in the future.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|while the record has grown on me (i've had it for a few months) <br />a bit, it's still gonna be my least favorite when it's all said and done.  \\"Either Way\\" is a nice opener, \\"Walken\\" just builds and builds, and \\"What Light\\" will become a wilco classic.  \\"Shake it Off\\", however, maybe the worst song Tweedy ever wrote (yea, great lyrics on that one). <br />still one of my all-time favorite bands, still going to see them live.  just don't call this album a masterpiece, because it isn't...
B000OCXMAE|4.0|When I first heard this album, I was very taken aback by how soft it felt on the back end. I nearly felt betrayed that Linkin Park, masters of edgy, hard rock/rap would put out something that is really easy on the ears. After listening to it a few times, however, I came to appreciate the musicianship and higher quality of the music. There's no blazing anthem like 'Faint' or 'Papercut' from Meteora and Hybrid Theory, respectively, but it's obvious that the band has really improved in terms of writing and musical technique as evidenced by some wicked guitar riffs and very original drum work. This is not to say that this album was without flaws, but it is worth the price of an album today and succeeds in standing alone as a good, if not great, collection of music.       In terms of a new direction, Linkin Park has taken just about everyone by surprise. With previous releases up to and including LP Underground Volume Six, the edgy sound is very apparent. High amounts of distortion, revved beats, and Chester and Mike's vocal stylings can be both easy and [...] the ears at the same time, much to the enjoyment of LP's fanbase. On this record, however, it is harder to find that edge. 'Given Up', 'What I've Done', and 'No More Sorrow' preserve some of the hard rock sound fans have come to know and love, but it seems different, almost more subdued. That said, these songs are wonderfully produced and are capable of carrying the album initially. Upon further examination, the listener discovers the excellent guitar riffs on other songs, like the one  found at the end of 'In Pieces'. This, coupled with much more mature lyrics, make 'Minutes to Midnight' a joy to discover and listen to repeatedly.       While the band as a whole sounds fantastic, the production was inherently flawed. This is not to say the album itself sounds terrible or is of low quality, but listeners are most assuredly going to take issue with the instrumentation. 'Wake' sets the tone for many other songsincluding 'Leave Out All The Rest', 'Bleed It Out', 'Valentine's Day', and 'In Pieces' in that it takes far, far too long for the track to get going. In each song, it is nearly half over before the listener hears the full band. It is questionable why Linkin Park would choose to mix tracks in this way, as it is blatantly apparent that they are at their best when they all play together. Without bass, drums, and a full compliment of guitars, Chester Bennington's voice sounds meek and awkward on 'Valentine's Day'; Mike Shinoda's rap on 'Bleed It Out' has the potential to get fans in a frenzy, but the thin instrumentation flatlines the song. In fact, if LP had just introduced some of their old-school flavor to this track, it could easily be a number one hit. Instead, it's just a decent song. There's a sneaking suspicion here that the reason for much of the thin sound is to make the record seem more drawn-out. If this is the case and LP is concerned about the length of the album, the simple answer would have been to add a few more of their 'over 100' songs written for this record to add more substance. The long buildup just makes 'Minutes to Midnight' initially seem like a ballad album, which upon further inspection is most certainly not.      In making 'Minutes to Midnight', Linkin Park will almost assuredly alienate some of their fan base. In all cases, change from record to record should be expected from great bands, as pigeon-holing into a specific genre can very easily lead to irrelevance in the music scene. It seems, though, that this change has gone just a little too far for some fans to follow. If they had just allowed more full-band instrumentation throughout the record, it would have been much easier for fans to accept. Because it succeeds in many aspects and is an album worth keeping, it's deserving of four stars, but its shortcomings limit it from being held in such high regard in terms of success as LP's predecessor albums.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is where Rainbow should've stayed at -- Ronnie James Dio on lead vocals with Ritchie Blackmore on lead guitar. The songs on this album are hard hitting and showcase Blackmore's neo-classical guitar style that predates the shredders of the 80's. And of course with Dio's voice and choice of lyrics you can't go wrong. \\"Run With The Wolf\\" and \\"Stargazer\\" are my favorites with the later's extended guitar soloing that showcases Blackmore's liking for exotic scales. One of the best guitar players out there with the best singer in metal/hard rock!!!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Awsome is one of the most over-used words, but in this case it really is the best discription. The cd is incredible and the dvd is even better. While the songs on both are the same, they had different agendas for both mediums. What ever your favorite style of music, this combo will help you learn to love the \\"blues\\".
B000002JB8|5.0|I've been getting more and more into New Age music and the more I hear the better I like Vangelis. I've been a fan for years and this CD Oceanic is one of my favorites. The sound and the orchestrations are mystical, mysterious and haunting. His use of instrumentation, sound and vocals is simply awesome. In my opinion this CD represents the true sound of New Age in that it takes you to \\"another world\\". Highly recommend.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Tron is a blast form the past. Awsome story its just a good SIFI movie. Tron is comming from the dawn of special effects. A simplely enjoyable. if you like stuff from the Early 90s and Late 80s this is the way to go. and the THXcertified audio is amazing. It takes this movie to the next level.
0143034901|5.0|I loved this book  It is well written and flows like a beautiful dance. I am recommending it to all my friends
B000OCXMAE|2.0|This album is exactly the reason why the average young American doesn't fork out the $12 at record stores any longer, and instead just downloads the album illegally off of the internet.  WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE ENTIRE ALBUM IS BALLADS!  Slow, sensitive crap!  First off, I have to say that 90% of the reason that I bought this album today (the day it came out) was because I'm going to see Linkin Park at the KROQ Weenie Roast in L.A. this weekend and I wanted to be familiar with the new songs before seeing them in concert.  Boy, what a mistake! <br /> <br />If I could describe this album in one word, the word would be FILLER.  Aside from maybe 2 or 3 songs, the entire album is FILLER.  \\"What I've Done\\" is in almost the exact same key as \\"Numb\\" was, and even sounds almost identical in the chorus.  The only reason I am giving this album 2 stars and not 1 or 0 stars is for the songs \\"Given Up\\" and \\"Bleed It Out.\\"  Those 2 songs are the only very very slight redeeming quality of this way over-hyped, way over-rated record.  I have never been one to encourage bands to write music that all sounds the same and that never changes, but in Linkin Park's case that sure might have been a good idea!     <br /> <br />Part of the reason that I was really looking forward to this album was because of Rick Rubin's involvement in the production of it.  After the incredible and career-changing things Rubin did for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, System Of A Down, etc., I really thought he might push Linkin Park to make the career-defining album that their fans deserve to hear.  Apparently, he just sat around all day with the band watching soap operas so they could write about their feelings.   <br /> <br />I would highly recommend that you save your money.  If you are a huge Linkin Park fan, go to your nearest used record store...I'm sure there are already quite a few copies of this album in the bargain bin as we speak.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Gulag Orkestar, the debut album of Albuquerque native and then nineteen year old Zach Condon, is a memorable and beautiful musical journey through the beer halls and streets of Eastern Europe. Condon, whose production of the album was helped by Jeremy Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel, A Hawk and a Hacksaw) and Heather Trost (A Hawk and a Hacksaw), was heavily influenced by the alluring, folk sounds of violins, cellos, ukuleles, mandolins, glockenspiels, drums, tambourines, clarinets, pianos and the accordion. These instruments, brought together in the style of Balkan folk music, play host to Condon's voice. His crooning, dusty voice rides over every melody.  <br /> <br />The result of the collaboration of the above is a haunting collection of mournful ballads and pulsating beats that touch the human spirit. Like the tide, this music ebbs and flows and washes over you again and again. The bohemian wonder that has simply poured from the previously unknown artist is simply extraordinary. This musical achievement heralds Condon as one of our most promising new arrivals yet.
0739308726|4.0|I am not that far along in this book yet, but I LOVE IT!! Mr. Dotrice does a fantastic job of reading it and helps bring Martin's characters to life (I have the audio edition).  As always, Martin leaves you hanging with one character as he then wets your whistle by catching you up on a character he left you behind with earlier.  I cannot wait to get in my car every day just so I can follow along on the next journey.   <br />     I am actually not a fantasy reader by nature and started the series not only because my co-workers recommended it, but I got tired of being out of the loop as they discussed it constantly.  I started the series believing I would dislike it because it was a fantasy book.  However, Martin really grabbed me from the start and I have needed no further proding to catch myself up to speed.   <br /> <br />*Side notes:  This is the third book in a series that begins with A Game of Thrones.  The second is A Clash of Kings.  Martin can get graphic, gore and sex, in portions of the novel and this series may not be for younger readers or those who may find those scenes offensive.
B0000042H4|5.0|Okay, so we numerous recordings for Wagner's epic Ring Cycle: Solti, Bohm Furtwangler, Levine, Haitink, Barenboim, etc. And all of these leave me to one conclusion: the many differences lead me to believe that all of these ring sets have their own authenticities and setbacks. And here we have Sir Georg Solti with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />Everyone knows that this is the first studio recording of the Ring. And everyone knows that Solti has become a famous name that's attributed to this. But what I don't understand is why \\"Die Walkure\\" was recorded last. It went \\"Rheingold,\\" \\"Siegfried,\\" \\"Gotterdammerung,\\" and then \\"Walkure\\". \\"Walkure\\" is supposed to be the second opera in the Ring, but I guess the producers wanted \\"Walkure\\" to be heard in a more stereo sound later in the years.<br /><br />Solti's conducting is driven with sheer muscle, but sometimes he makes the Ring overemotional. His \\"Donner's Song\\" & Gotterdammerung Preludes are clear examples: they're annoyingly loud and bombastic. Nonetheless he almost seldom loses control with anything. His clear focus on the drama is astonishing.<br /><br />The Vienna Philharmonic is a very powerful orchestra. The woodwinds aren't really the most beautiful in Solti's Ring, but they are still a plus. French horns and Wagner tubas make this a recommended listening. The strings could've added a bit more work, but they are strikingly spectacular everywhere else. The orchestra gives it their all in Siegfried Act Two & Three, but they are at their weakest in Walkure Act One & Three (Bohm's Bayreuth does it better). Overall, it's the loudest and certainly most bombastic out of all the Ring orchestras combined.<br /><br />As for the singers, they're top-class, though some of them really were past their prime when this Ring Cycle was made from 1957 to 1965. Hans Hotter is the superior Wotan. He sounds powerful throughout the Ring (except Solti's Rheingold, in which a less stellar George London performs). It's true that he gives an utterly heartbreaking performance during \\"Der Augen Leuchtendes Paar\\", and it's true that he was well past his prime when he did this Ring (but don't let that stop you from listening to his classic \\"Dir unweisen ruf' ich's in's Ohr\\"). Makes me wish I heard Keilberth and Knappertsbusch's Ring recordings sooner.<br /><br />Birgit Nilsson is the best Brunnhilde on the market. Her Valkyrie cry is delightful, and her \\"Soll fesselnder Schlaf fest mich binden\\" is brilliant beyond belief.<br /><br />For Siegmund, we have James King. For Sieglinde, we have Regine Crespin for Solti, they are absolutely spectacular here. The emotion that they pack in their roles: lots of incredible singing here in Walkure.<br /><br />Wolfgang Windgassen may very well be the best Siegfried for the ages. His `Forging Scene\\" in the latter renditions are defiantly inspiring. His last scene in Gotterdammerung is celestial and overwhelming. Be careful, though: he may sound a bit past his prime when he performs \\"Gotterdammerung,\\" but don't let that carry you away from his \\"Siegfried\\".<br /><br />Gustav Niedlinger has a heaviness that overwhelms a few other baritones. When he sings his only sequence in Gotterdammerung Act Two Scene One, his emotion is so pure that his son Hagen would've drowned himself in tears (Too melodramatic? Sorry about that.). No one can top him, and I'm talking about Zoltan Kelemen of the Karajan ring & Ekkehard Wlaschiha of the Levine ring. The only problem is that his character sounds too one-dimensional. Alberich isn't just some cardboard-cutout bad guy. He has a very good reason why he wants to take revenge on the world. Overall, Niedlinger is amazing throughout Wagner's Ring (He deserves many awards for \\"Bin ich nun frei?\\").<br /><br />Gerhard Stolze is the creepiest Mime ever known to humankind. This dwarf outsings other Mimes on the market. When he sings \\"Die stucken! Das Schwert!\\" his anger and fear is the most effective to almost all Ring listeners. Butof course, Stolze's truly unsettling caricaturing of Alberich's brother will catch on after repeated listening.<br /><br />Set Svanholm may be the weakest Loge on disc. He is not very ominous throughout all of his scenes, and his lack of a sinister atmosphere greatly affects the entire Rheingold. But he'll soon be forgotten later on during the Trilogy.<br /><br />As for eveyone else, they're great, also. Gottlob Frick ranks with Matti Salminen as an ultimate Hagen. The Rheindaughters sound a bit distorted due to the flawed sounds in Rheingold, but it all improves once they return in Gotterdammerung.  Jean Madeira sings Erda in \\"Rheingold\\", while Marga Hoffgen sings Erda in Siegfried, and they both sound equally beautiful and mystical. The Valkyries in \\"Walkure\\" are one of a kind, but they still don't match the Valkyries found in the live Bohm recording. Choir in \\"Gotterdammerung\\" is wonderful.<br /><br />The Solti recording is just one of the many Ring recordings that are available. If you like bombast and heavy drama, then this should be a no brainer.brother will catch on after repeated listening.     Set Svanholm may be the weakest Loge on disc.

0609610570|1.0|I was looking forward to this book with a great deal of anticipation on \\"how.\\" The trouble was, the underlying assumptions were that any reader has the carte-blanche power to hire and fire CEO's at-will. In the more common work-a-day world, I know of virtually no one with this kind of authority, so there was precious little I was able to take away from it. Overall, the theme of the text was more to instill a great deal of fear in those who are under you so THEY execute tasks, not the one who is in charge. I fail to see how this could apply to anyone but the precious few in the U.S. who have a 7-8 figure salary. I am also very puzzled at the positive reviews I have seen so far.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I've seen the live musical 4 times and this is as close as you'll get to having the show in your own home.  It illustrates the story much better just because it has character development.  I love the musical- Live or DVD!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Magnificent images, intuitive editing, august, vivid narration. I've never been happier with a DVD purchase. This beautiful survey of the world's ecosystems leaves me with mixed feelings. While I am awed by the tenacity and diversity of the life portrayed, my sense of what we are losing, destroying, for the sake of our lifestyle, blooms and spreads. The narration rarely makes reference to issues of sustainability or the tenuous hold some species and systems have on survival. My title for this review was drawn from the Deep Oceans segment, late in the series. For the most part, the series leaves informed viewers to come to our own sense of what we value, what is at stake, and what we are prepared to do about it all. The series may either damn us, proving that we knew the beauty of what we were destroying, or inspire us to do something about reversing the destruction before our own reputation as a wastrel species is sealed. I cannot recommend this series highly enough.

B000002KZA|3.0|CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN, Depeche Mode's third album, was as large a step forward in evolving the band's sound as much as [[ASIN:B000HIVQ8U A Broken Frame]] had from their [[ASIN:B000ESSTKQ debut]].  No doubt, new member Alan Wilder was a crucial part in honing Depeche Mode's new development, as well as Martin Gore flexing a stronger songwriting muscle for this album.  CONSTRUCTION is the most focused effort of the earliest Mode albums, being more musically consistent than either Frame or it's much-praised successor [[ASIN:B000HIVQ94 Some Great Reward]], with a integration of industrial (emphasis on the lower-case \\"i\\") sounds and textures used throughout.  Many of these tracks, in retrospect,  are early templates for more overtly Industrial-inspired songs to come such as \\"People Are People\\", \\"Blasphemous Rumors\\", and \\"Stripped\\".    Like many early 80's electronic records of it's day, CONSTRUCTION utilizes much synthesized horns, with  \\"Love In Itself\\" being the most glaring example (not one of my fave Depeche songs anyway).  \\"Told You So\\", on the other hand, uses this same sound quite inventively. This album's most notable track, the single \\"Everything Counts\\", is among the band's greatest songs of all time (... at least in my opinion).   A fluid track from start to finish it features great percussion and catchy hooks all around. (Check out the enthusiastic crowd participation it received in the Depeche tour documentary, [[ASIN:B0000CEB62 101]].)    Fans of this particular album should consider Rhino Records' [[ASIN:B000N3ST8Y deluxe reissue]] of this CD. The noticeable difference being that the deluxe version is based on the original UK tracklisting, and concludes with a very brief reprise \\"Everything Counts\\" instead of an extended remix.  The deluxe version also includes a DVD featuring a highly-informative documentary on the making of this album as well as additional non-album tracks and B-sides (including the extended \\"Everything Counts\\" and the excellent single,\\"Get the Balance Right\\").  Also remember when making your decision that the bonus music on the Rhino version is only accessible on the DVD (as well as double the price).

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I've been a Rush devotee since I was a pre-teen when I first heard A Farewell to Kings (which remains my personal favorite). Having said that, Snakes & Arrows is the first Rush album I've bought within a week of its release since Grace Under Pressure. I've since purchaced the late 80s and 90s material, but find that while all of these releases contain some classics, they also contain material that comes short of the very high mark I have set for them. Hit and miss, I guess you could say. <br /> <br />Snakes & Arrows comes along... <br /> <br />I won't go into too much detail about the sounds and themes since there has already been so much said. What I will say is that the music on this album is doing for me what Rush's music hasn't done since Signals and Grace Under Pressure, and actually I find Snakes & Arrows a stronger album overall than those! Don't get me wrong, as I mentioned above, there have been personal favorites sprinkled over the past couple of decades. But I've never been so satisfied with a Rush album beginning to end, maybe since Moving Pictures. <br /> <br />If you are a big Rush fan, but have been wondering whether or not its worth picking this baby up, I encourage you to do it! I have been listening to it non-stop since I grabbed it last week, and it just keeps getting better...
B000OCXFCO|4.0|This record is pretty good from start to finish. A very tight recording, more like Countdown. This record has a heavy driving sound mixed with cool clean guitar sounds, similar to the great \\"So Far, So Good, So What\\" record.   -An album that is always overlooked by Megadeth fans.  <br /> <br />What makes this record sound most \\"Megadeth'ish\\", is the politically driven lyrics within each song.  Dave is once again pissed off about the world's conflicts, THANK GOD!  <br /> <br />One disappointment is the remake of \\"A Tout De Monde\\"  This song and \\"Return to Hanger\\" on the previous record are just fillers. The originals should be left alone!   <br /> <br />In my opinion, Megadeth was Marty, Dave, and David.  Dave will never be able to replace Marty... Marty added soo much taste and unique qualities that made Megadeth in their glory days.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, buy this one for sure.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Great assortment of songs. Yes, there's some f bombs and other swearing, so avoid if you are easily offended. Love this CD!
0790731509|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest movies of all times.  Paul Newman is amazing, the ultimate rebel.  Who else would cut the heads off parking meters because \\"Small town, not much to do in the evenin.\\"
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Ok the season isn't over yet but it has had some of the best episodes so far. It starts out slow in the beginning and Lost some fans complained about the season premiere being disapointing because not much happened. But Lost fans complain about everything really. When the show doesn't give answers...they complain...when the show does give answers...they complain that the gave too many answers. Oh plus they always complain about it's breaks. It took like 3 months off to satisfy fans that were complaining about it taking a break, coming back and then taking another break and another. Of course they still complained about the 3 month break though lol. Plus next season, the show won't be back until January, I wonder how much whining that's gonna cause.<br /><br />  Anyway the season starts off at the camp of the Others with Jack locked in his own room while Sawyer and Kate are locked in seperate large cages. Jack meets Juliet who brings him food and also obviously did her research on him. She also trys hard to gain his trust and I'm still not sure if he's a fool or not for buying into it evntually. Eko also has to be rescued early in the season by Locke who mysteriously lost his voice for a brief time after th hatch explosion. Sadly though the awseome Mr. Eko dies like an episode later after Locke rescues him from Polar bears. The black fog disguised as his brother tests him and he fails the test obviously. It sucks that he dies but the scene is done sooo creepy that it's satisfying anyway. That is if you can get passed that it's sorta silly that the fog takes the form of a giant hand and picks Eko up and tosses him around violently.<br /><br />  You also have some pretty mysterious but cool stuff going on with Desmond who has an odd new gift of knowing what will happen next after the hatch blast. He has visions of Charlie dieing and does everything he can to stop that from happening. You also have Jack having to decide whether or not if he wants to perform a surgery that will save Ben's life from a tumor. But since Jack is a smart guy, he realizes he can use that to his advantage. As he threatens not to save Ben if the Others don't let Kate and Sawyer go. Which is good for Sawyer since one guy that had his g/f killed by Sun  for some reason thinks that killing Sawyer will get him revenge.<br /><br />  We also get some awesome stuff with Hurley finding out something shocking about the plane survivors and finding out how Locke got crippled. We also find out who it is that conned Sawyer's parents and Sawyer gets his deserved revenge. You won't shed a tear though because the guy is pretty evil and has it coming. Since what he did to Sawyer's parents was hardly the worse thing he has done. We also find out that Jack and Claire are infact related and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You also get to know the Others a bit more as well and get a creepy scene where Ben introduces Locke to the mysterious Jacob. This season has had some truly great episodes and might've shut-up the fans who complained earlier in the season about not much happening. But I doubt it since Lost fans complain about everything lol. Anyway a lot of great stuff has happened in this season and it's not even over yet!at will save Ben's life from a tumor.

B0006B2A2E|4.0|i enjoyed this movie...it makes you think about fate and what is meant to be will ultimately happen, no matter what you do to try to change it. jim carrey and kate winslet work beautifully together.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I first saw this when I was about 12. I hated it at first because I wasn't mature enough to watch it with out having nightmares. Luckely after occasionaly watching it over a period of about two years I final was able to to watch the whole movie from beginiing to end without stopping except for bathroom breaks. If you saw the original black and white version of this made in the sixties and the off brodway play which ran four about four years in New York. I also thought I would inform you that the whole alternate first ending is not include on this dvd. The al;ternate nding was only avilable for about the first three days the dvd was avilable for sale on line and in stores when it first came out. Unfortunately Mr. Griffen had not given approval to have the alternate ending included on the dvd so only fragments of it remain on the second release of it. When young rick morransis  discovers a mystery planet trouble some comes up. Can rick tame this blood thirst monster will he is forced to murder to feed it;s growing hunger. I also thought I'd inform you that two of the members of this cast are currently decased. John Candy died from a heart prtoblem I belive it was shorly after his role as Barf in spaceballs the famous spoof of the starwars triology that came out after this. In addition shortly before the dvd release vincent Garden also passed away. Can seymor control this  monster of nature and what fate lies in store for the human race. Find out in thrilling action packed hillarious finally.  This movie should be fine for kids 13 and up due to mild gory images mild rude humor mild violence in a couple of parts, intensity and occasional inapropriate language at the begining, middle and the end of the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is hard to believe what little fanfare this received when in production and even harder to believe that it only lasted one season. Fox Network screwed the pooch with how they handled this show. Why won't Sci-Fi Channel pick this up?
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album is awesome. I haven't been listening to Meagdeth for too long, but I have all of their albums from Killing Is My Business through Youthanasia, and The System Has Failed. For me though, I gravitate more toward 80's Magdeth, the real thrash sound, basically their first 4 albums. I was somewhat disappointed with Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia, because they weren't really thrash, but they grew on me. The System Has Failed was a relief to me because they sort of went back to their thrash roots. But, this album blows it away. Thrash Megadeth is back! I've always loved how Megadeth has multiple solos throughout their songs. This album is a total solo-fest. Solos everywhere. This album is heavy, loud, and fast. It's a very political album, obviously, but Dave tells it like it is. If you like Megadeth you will love this album. If you like metal in general, you'll love it. It does not disappoint. Highlights for me are Washington Is Next!, United Abominations, Gears of War, A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free), Play For Blood, and Burnt Ice. Burnt Ice has blazing solos. The whole second half of the song is basically a solo. I was rattling my goddamn head so much I got dizzy. Hell yeah. Nowadays, Metallica only wishes they can make an album like this, considering their last effort had no solos whatsoever. Megadeth's bringing the thrash back. Rock on!
B000089RV6|5.0|Hands down the best AC/DC CD. This is the cream of the crop, and it doesn't get any better than this. To this day, each song rocks loud and hard, and vocalist Brian Johnson was never better. A must for any hard rock collection, your ears will be bleeding.
0375505091|5.0|After my sister worked with Annie in a photo shoot here in Madrid, she recommended I buy this book, since I have always been a huge fan of Annie.  This book is very insightful and complete of her work.
B000M3452Y|5.0|I enjoyed their 2005 release 'LCD Soundsystem' so I thought I would give them a listen for their second time around. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprized! They are making much more sense to me now and I appreciate their dance/pop routine much more. In other words, if you liked their previous effort this is much better! Buy it!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I have never written a review before, and generally I don't expect that anyone really wants to hear my opinion.  However; this album is so bad that I felt obligated to say something. <br /> <br />Yes, I downloaded it, and yes, it's before the official release date.  Let me just say that this album is the perfect example for why free downloads SHOULD be allowed, because a lot of LP fans are going to run out and buy this thing, and waste $15-$20 of hard earned money. <br /> <br />I will not waste everybody's time describing each song, but please let me say that this album consists of 2 nu-metallica wanna be songs (God help us), 2 awful Fort Minor-like rap songs, and the rest of the material is slow, watered down, unoriginal \\"ballads\\" where Chester whines about something, over really poorly crafted beats. <br /> <br />If you've heard the rumors of this album showcasing a \\"grown-up\\" side of LP, or that the band was trying to edge more towards the rock side of their genre, (i.e., no Shinoda) those runors do NOT accurately describe this album.  It is overly whiny, with weak political themes, and music that does not inspire.  I got into LP because I saw them live and they were amazing - energetic, spirited and driven.  If they are supposed to showcase their new work on tour this summer, I don't know how they'll do it. <br /> <br />Please save yourself the money, do not buy this album.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I love monsters, and i thought this movie would be awesome!  Although the creatures/monster are awesome, i just felt like the movie was just \\"OK.\\" It just didn't keep me captivated.  I like Hugh Jackman, especially as Wolverine, but this is just so typically aweful at times.  Kate Beckinsale is a good actress and she was a highlight to the movie, but it was just cheesy, I'm sorry to say that is movie was a disappointment to me, but if you love monsters/creature of the Old, this is a movie for you, it just wasn't for me.  It would of been nice to just have one monster per movie maybe, but it was just too much.  Sometimes less is more!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I bought the Linkin Park album and put myself through the pain of sitting and listening to every second of every song. This album is Linkin Park at their WORST!! They should of never went with producer Rick Rubin and should of stayed with Don Gilmore. Linkin Park is ruined!! I have bought all there cds' as they have come out but because of this one I will listen to somebody elses before I will buy there next album!! DO NOT waste your money!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is a 2004 record that I got in early 2007 but it is still relevant today and will continue to remain relevant as long as people die! Yes, this is because \\"Funeral\\" is almost bound to make you cry and seems quite helpful in helping you get over a loved ones passing. It also features one of my new 'all time favourite' songs, the garguantan, \\"Wake Up\\". This album is for any true musick fan. It features now as one of my favourtie albums ever!
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I am an old guy.  55 years old, love good guitar/vocal/lyrics.  John seeme to have captured the magic in music that made you want to go out and purchse the album, bring it back home and spin it countless times.  Very good music.  Everything falls into place.
B000GW8VTO|4.0|I like this movie, and especially on HD.  Overall, the story was good, and it was just passionate scene with Mel and Pepper at the end. I bought this for my HD Collection and I'm happy to say that it was worth the purchase!  Although, its not the best HD DVD Movie that I own, it is certainly a great movie about a war.  Keep me at the edge of my seat! Good war movies, and I hate war movies, but it drew me in every minute.  Atleast give it a watch to see if you would like it before you by the Standard or HD version.
B000002MFN|5.0|I absolutely love this album!!! I heard about it back in 1992 when I was in the 10th grade! I LOVED IT!!! This is  really Madonna's best album. It kinda gives me memories of high school. This album rocks!!! My fave track is Deeper and Deeper!
0553296981|5.0|Great book. A valuable addendum when reading The Freedom Writers. A very positive teaching tool. My 17 year old daughter has enjoyed the book and it has enhanced her views and opened her mind to many issues that still exist in the world today.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|If you are looking for comfortable,light weight, full sized headphones with excellent sound.. look no further..For the money these are about as good as it gets. I bought my first ones 15 years ago and only just recently got a new pair.
B000E1MTY0|4.0|I watch the movie on Standard, but I finally watch the HD DVD version.  Although the movie was \\"Ok to par,\\" the HD version is awesome and at times it is brilliant, yet at times it was just \\"OK,\\" I have it for my HD Collection but it doesn't top some other HD DVD movies (Seasbicuit or Phantom of the Opra).  I love the dark side of Batman and that made this movie a little better than a playful hero.  I'm happy with the purchase and its a good collection for your HD's.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I was so excited to buy this album, but when I got it and listened a few times I was very disppointed. I was hoping her next album was just as original as the first. Unfortunately, there's nothing that sticks out in this album. Every song sounds like the other. I really do like \\"Keep Holding On\\", but it's the only song I like at all. It's almost like she just wrote whatever songs she could fast enough to produce another album and please her fans. She's lost her edge.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I've always been a fan, but CD doesn't measure up to anything they've done in the past. I hear everyone's cries of musical maturity and progression, but this is not either of those. It's just a mess of Fort Minor having too much effect on what Linkin Park is and the album never quite figuring out what it's supposed to sound like. <br /> <br />Take notice that What I've Done, their first single, is the track that is most reminiscent of their old sound. They wouldn't want to scare anyone away, now, would they? Once the smokescreen fades away and everyone realizes it's not the old LP, I predict they'll throw out yet another overly-political video/single (Hands Held High) while Bush is still in office. In Between and In Pieces would have been lackluster B-sides on either of the other albums. On this album, they make the final cut. Finally, I'm annoyed that they put an intro track in there. LP has never been one to tease me with garbage like that. Waste of a track, in my opinion. Similarly, Minutes to Midnight was largely a waste of my time. Download Given Up, Bleed It Out, and No More Sorrow off of iTunes.
B000O179A4|3.0|The music was great.  When I first heard about this movie all I heard was Beyonce, Beyonce.  But if you are going to call the movie by one person's name then it should be titled... Jennifer. Jennifer Hudson can sing Beyonce up under a table.  The movie was okay, kind of a story heard many times before, but still it was enjoyable. Lots of wigs... and gowns.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!  Everything about it!  I truly truly, did i say truly? LOVE this movie!  The music is amazing!!! But wait, the HD version is on top of its game!! It is absolutely amazing!  Goosebumps on some scene!!  I was so much happy with this HD Version!!! You \\"HAVE TO\\" buy this especially if you own HD player and LOVE this movie!!! I'll be honest, I dont like Opera movie, but this movie i totally fell in love with it!  Amazing Picture! Amazing Music! Amazing Movie!!!!
B00005JPGO|5.0|This movie is one of the best.. I think it was very well done and the actings are so great.. I saw the movie in theater and fell in love with the movie ;) <br />also the original score of this movie is amazing as well..  <br />
B000HCO83Q|2.0|this movie is a great example of one of my biggest gripes about sequels.  a sequel will never be as good as the original if the original director doesn't do it himself.  that was the problem with this movie, the original director went off and did superman returns, (which sucked by the way) and another lame director took over this movie.  i believe this movie could have been truly spectacular if more attention was paid to story and character development.   <br /> <br />a few of the most important characters were killed off, like Stewart's character Xavier.  and it seems like they simply cheated us by bringing back Jean Grey with only a sentence or two explanation that feigns credibility to the original story. like \\"jean grey was always the most powerful mutant ever, we just didn't mention it to you throughtout the first two movies.\\" a very cheap way to bring her back.  also cyclops was killed of right away, for seemingly no reason other than to get rid of him.  mystique was also given this kind of lousy treatment.  this new director totally screwed up this sequel. <br /> <br />overall the director relyed too much on the special effects (which were pretty good all things considering) and not enough on the characters and an involving storyline.  the thing that made the first two xmen movies so great was because they had a great story and strongly driven characters, and then the special effects were like the icing on the cake.  just like you can't have a good cake with just the icing, you can't expect a movie to be great if the story and characters have no substance. <br /> <br />the second xmen movie should have been the last in my opinion.  the special effects aren't bad, nothing spectacular.  but the story doesn't even compare to the first two's depth and believablilty.  but if you want to finish off you xmen collection, go ahead and buy it.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I discovered Muse from a movie soundtrack.  I had never heard of them before.  This CD is amazing.  There are a few songs I didn't care for, but overall, I'm in awe at the sounds they produce.  Truly mindblowing melodies and fantastic harmony.  It is a very political CD, so if you're squeamish about that, I can't recommend it.
B000GFLEAY|5.0|Simply the best HD DVD movie out there!  That's it!  Its a great horse movie!  King Kong was great on HD DVD, but this overwelming takes over the HD realm of Demos.  If you want to show people how HD looks and feels, this is the Movie!  I was so eager to see what this HD movie was going to be! I own about 12 HD DVD, and i love 'em all, but this Seabiscuit is by far the Best HD movie! Hands down! (not to say its the best movie out my collection, but in picture, this movie Blows them out of the tracks.)  A great story about a Trainer, Jockey and Owner and the Horse that brought them together to conquer thier obstacles called Life.  This is the one you HAVE TO get for HD! I am overwelm with joy with this purchase!  Add it to your Collections and Show OFF the HD!!!!!

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a recording from original cast and it is terrific!  We purchased this CD in advance of  upcoming trip to see Wicked on Broadway and my children (ages 6 and 8) love the music.
630469654X|5.0|Humor, romance, drama, fantasy...this movie has it all.  A family ready story of love denied.  Matthew Brodrick at his best, using sly wit to counter the seriousness with which the others actors played their roles.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is one of the smarter bands in the rock business today - their cryptic lyrics, unexpected chord changes and clever use of studio effects put them a cut above the idiotic mid-90s pop-punkers they shared the spotlight with. Lots of creativity. For example, this group's got three lead guitarists, but DOESN'T use those guitars in the two senses most three-guitar bands do: either crush you with volume, or craft quarter-hour guitar jams. While there's some fine hard-rock here (Electioneering, Climbing Up Walls, bits of Paranoid Android), the best of this album comes from the quiet, moody, pensive songs with plenty of studio experimentation: the chilling Exit Music (for a Film), climactic closer The Tourist, mellow, paranoid, piano-driven (and Beatles-quotin') radio hit Karma Police, the chilling Subterranean Homesick Alien (gotta love the Dylan reference), and the slightly more optimistic but still extremely dark Lucky.<br /><br />Then there's Paranoid Android.<br /><br />This three-part suite is quickly becoming one of my favorite songs of all time. It manages to contain every element of this album: a quiet acoustic section, a blaring rock section, the haunting \\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain doooooooooooown on meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.... from a greaaaat height, from a great aeeeee...\\" part (which is so fjordkin' awesome...) with the overdubbed \\"That's it sir, you're leaving\\" and the Gregorian chant backdrop; a brutal one-note guitar solo, and paranoid (it is called Paranoid Android, after all) lyrics. Think The Beatles' Happiness is a Warm Gun, only longer and even more depressing. Plus it quotes Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Schweet!<br /><br />Thom Yorke is one of the best vocalists ever - his voice is less a way of communicating the lyrics and more of a sixth instrument. Throughout the lyrics are cryptic, more about setting a mood than anything else. Compared to most of today's \\"alternative\\" (a genre I don't like - it fell apart when the grunge scene died, at least to me) rock, it sounds completely out of nowhere. There are a few touchstones: Pink Floyd, U2, late-period Beatles (all bands certainly worth getting to know if you don't know them already), but you can tell these guys are more leaders than followers and are destined for great things. I'd like to seem them on the fast track for rock canonization.<br /><br />Now before I proclaim this one of the ten greatest albums ever, I'd like to discuss the only mistake. Fitter Happier. Bad, bad idea. The computerized voiceover/ironic recitiation works perfectly in a fifteen second situation, but dragged out to two minutes? Uh-uh, doesn't work. But that's all that keeps OK Computer from being able to compete with the Abbey Roads, Kind of Blues and Sticky Fingers of this world.ock, it sounds completely out of nowhere.

B000065BPB|3.0|The product was great but, like so many things you get online, the \\"deal\\" you get is illusory when you factor in the enormous shipping charges. Why can't there be an option to use normal mail service so you won't incur such horrendous costs?
B000003BES|3.0|For those looking to start a Rolling Stones collection (as rock fan should): DON'T GO HERE. The first of many Stones compilations? Yes. But all that does is make it completely obselete. You can get most this album on the far-better Hot Rocks: while it's missing two key songs (Tell Me; The Last Time) that show up here, those two can easily be found on England's Newest Hitmakers and Out of Our Heads, respectively - those are both worth picking up in the first place. The only surprise is Good Times, Bad Times, which in truth didn't belong here and could've been shunted in favor of The Little Red Rooster, which so happened to be a UK #1. Yeah, there's (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, 19th Nervous Breakdown, Time Is on My Side, As Tears Go By, The Last Time, Play with Fire, Heart of Stone, Tell Me, Get Off of My Cloud and numerous other goodies, but those can be found on better, more coherent compilations that were later released. Now, in its day this was probably a pretty big hit, since it did contain a BUNCH of awesome Rolling Stones hits in one place. But these days it's not really worth getting for any reason other than nostalgia.
0156027321|5.0|A little slow to start but it was a truly ingenious story that I would recommend to anyone
B000FIMG68|3.0|Sadly, what promised to be one of the greatest tv series of all times has become a salad of clichés, predictable situations and improvisational ideas.  Seems to me that the writers/producers had a nice idea and never expecting such a huge success, decided to make the story several seasons and chapters longer by filling it up with soap opera situations along with ideas and characters that were not initially conceived. <br />The producers themselves confess that they didn't have a clue on what was the infamous hatch and what was inside of it, so they made the story along the way (two thumbs down for that!) <br />Season 2 box set is nicelly presented and although made in Mexico, it doesn't have spanish subtitles (brrrr).  The bonus material is nothing you should slip your wrists if not seen. <br />Fans only.  Otherwise, watch it on tv and spend your money in something else
0385335997|5.0|I love this series and have been reading straight through from Outlander to Voyager. Diana Gabaldon has done an heroic job of making her characters so endearing, so multidimensional -- I think about them often the way I think about a friend and feel like I know them; she's made me care about them so much. Her dedication to detail and to layering of each character is a gift.<br /><br />The only thing is there are some parts that are not believable:<br /><br />* I couldn't believe how easily Claire's daughter, Brianna, accepted the idea of Jamie as her father. I know Roger and Claire presented her with the evidence but what little anger or outrage she showed was short lived. She went from outrage at her mother even suggesting that Claire's first husband, Frank, was not really her father to a giddy declaration of Jamie as \\"Daddy!\\" I found it strange that there was very little confusion or anger with her mother at all this news. I guess the story had to move along so the author couldn't linger on this point.<br /><br />* Aside from the odd mention of the woman's \\"courses,\\" I was kind of surprised at the lack of mention at how menstruation was handled, practically, by a woman at this time in history. There's such detail about the way people prepared food, bathed, etc. at that time and was surprised by this omission.<br /><br />These are minor flaws for a remarkable series... If you are looking for a one-of-a-kind historical/romantic series, start with Outlander and keep going!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I bought the cd as I've always believed that Rush is one of the bravest and most honest bands of all times and also by reading Amazon client's reviews that rated the album as \\"great\\", \\"fantastic\\" \\"made me almost cry\\" and \\"their best work since moving pictures\\". <br />Now, as much as I like Rush I'm not a blind fan and I must say that although this is a much better and balanced work than Vapor Trails, it is still decades distanced from works and masterpieces such as Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace under Pressure or Counterparts. <br />To me, the first five songs are oblivionous, the instrumentals are by far the best and the rest is same old same old: great lyrics, power interpretation, nice voice, but nothing shocking, surprising or even disturbing. <br />A good cd by one of rock and prog icons of all times, but not their best work.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|First of all, this has to be the most diverse album Linkin Park has made musically and lyrically. Musically, the album is quite mellow and lovely(with the exception of \\"No More Sorrow\\", which is probably the most metal Linkin Park song ever made, and \\"Bleed It Out\\" a pure Mike Shinoda rap song); there are many layers of sound in alot of the songs that one might not pick up on during the first few listens, but that's just a sign that the album will grow on me like all good albums instead of the immediate gratification.<br /><br />Lyrically, Minutes To Midnight is an undisputed step up for the band. The Lyrics reveal the bands anger towards the war in iraq, the feeling and emotions after hurricane Katrina, hope, and most of all forgiveness and redemption. Alot, of the lyrics are open to personal interpretation as well which is what I like alot about Linkin Parks previous albums as well. Minutes to Midnight is an album for music lovers, those who have an open mind, and most of all true LP fan. I really like the record, and I hope you do to.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I don't know why this album is getting bashed so much. Yes, the sound is different, but that's good because the guys aren't repeating themselves with every album. The band even warned listeners that this was very different and might surprise some. There are still a few traditional heavy songs and a little rapping. (Watch out for the F word.) The lyrics are deeper, and there's a good variety of song styles. Like some others have said -- let it grow on you. I love it.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I have seen 4 versions of this story, and Branagh's is the best. I had to watch them as part of a school project and I was most moved by this interpretation.
0802130208|5.0|This book is amazing.  One of the few books i truely enjoyed from beginning to end.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Linkin Park since the beginning and I believe Hybrid Theory is one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Meteora, Linkin Park's second album (excluding Reanimation) was also very well made and every song had a nice flow to it and I even recommend that CD to everyone... Linkin Park's third album, Minutes to Midnight, however, is a complete waste of time and money.  None of their songs even sound remotely like the Linkin Park that the world fell in love with.  Also, the rapper makes very few appearances in the album, which is a shame because they were known for the genre that they created--a mixture of rock and rap.  Every song on this CD makes me want to go to sleep, or hit the 'next' button.  I did not have high hopes for this album, though, because the hit single \\"What I've Done\\" doesn't even sound like Linkin Park... It's an OK song, but it just doesn't sound like them.  Oh, and in case anyone is wondering, \\"What I've Done\\" is arguably the best song on their new album, and that doesn't really say alot about the other songs.  I feel like a fool for having spent money on this CD, and I even feel like a fool for having spent the gas money to drive to Best Buy (which is only like ten minutes from my house).  If you really really want these songs, just download them... It really isn't worth the money.  Linkin Park has either tried to re-invent themselves, or has just gotten lazy.  You'd think that with six members they could come up with a great album, but that just isn't the case.  If you don't want to pop a new CD into your car stereo and just say \\"WHAT THE F***?!\\" to yourself aloud, don't buy this album.  They have completely sold out... But hey, I guess they had a good run... For all of two albums...
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is one of the best mob movie series ever made and well worth the cost. Buy the 5 disc set with all the extras, you won't be sorry.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|People, you gotta give this album a chance! When I first heard this album, I thought it sounded very weird......and I'm a seasoned Rush listener! I have ALL of their studio albums! But, when I heard it in its entirety two more times, every song fell into place perfectly! That's how it is with very experienced bands like Rush! They make complex albums like this one that NEED multiple listens to get the true feel for the album! I must say, now that I have the true feel for this album, I am enjoying each and every song MORE & MORE with each listen of the album. In fact, I've had that awesome riff in \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" in my head ALL DAY TODAY!!! And....each song flows flawlessly from song to song....beginning to end! I can't get over how awesome this album sounds and is! Awesome album, from beginning to end!!!!!!!!! Each song has true texture and feeling....and Geddy's voice is second to none on this album! Powerful sounding voice! <br /> <br />When I compare this album to all their others, I must say that this album has to be in their top 5 best albums ever made. Buy it and truly listen to it, one, two, three and more times. You will think it's one of their BEST as well. Also, as if everything I've stated so far weren't enough, the production and sound quality on this album is PERFECT! Crystal clear sound.....even at high volume! (Unlike Vapor Trails, which I had to return to the store and exchange it for another copy of VT because the sound quality was horrible on the first copy I bought, and I don't think it was much better on the second one either) In summary.....'Snakes & Arrows'.....ENJOY!!!! Sure to be yet another classic by one of the BEST Rock bands of all time........RUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br />
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Never watched any of her live shows on DVD. So when I bought this one together with the Confessions on a Dancefloor CD I was really amazed that at 48 she can still strut her stuff bending her body like no one else can. She also plays instruments too LIVE! Some say that they have seen the end of her reign with the lukewarm American Life but she came back and still sits on the throne as pop queen and dancing queen of the modern era. This tour also marked 60 shows all sold-outs, not even the biggest female singers like Britney, Mariah or Whitney can achieve. If you want a music concert DVD to party with, the Confessions Tour is highly recommended.
B00001OH7U|4.0|After DB's excursion into blue-eyed soul on \\"Young Americans\\" which yielded two sizable hits in the form of the title track and the even more popular \\"Fame\\" (co-written by John Lennon), he returned to his trusty weird pop and created a new alter-ego The Thin White Duke for this album. It's difficult to believe that he was so heavily into cocaine at the time this album was created as it's got some real gems on it. Unfortunately it has some real crap on it as well. Let's deal with the good stuff first. The title track opens with galactic train sounds (reminiscent of those heard in  the film \\"The Man Who Fell To Earth\\") inspired by one of Bowie's muses at the time, the synthesizer-based German band Kraftwerk and evolves into one funky number that hardly seems over ten minutes long, what with the odd references to black magic, fascism and the ubiquitous coke. \\"Golden Years\\" was the lone hit from this album and it's a joy of jumbled genres like funk-pop and space age doo-wop. With that golden falsetto and catchy hand-claps, this piece is one of my all-time favorites. I also really dig Bowie's ode to loving a TV in the funky \\"TVC15\\" which is simply contagious. \\"Stay\\" isn't a bad song but it's overly long at six minutes plus. As for the songs I dislike, there's the over-the-top sentimentality of \\"Word On A Wing\\", though its lyrics aren't atrocious. The melody's just tired and a bit cliche as it also is on \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" in which David seems to be channeling Sinatra. At least this mediocrity is a cover song and not a Bowie original. That said, he does sing these songs beautifully and puts a lot of heart into them. Get this one for the rockers and personal taste aside, you may find yourself loving the ballads.
B00005JPAO|4.0|<br />Interesting movie - it tells the story of which no one could possibly know was happening to the Royal Family directly after Princess Diana's death.  The tabloid press they say was invented by the British - and the death of Diana was certainly no exception.   <br /> <br />Helen Mirren is great as the Queen herself.  Because the movie takes a look at the inside family drama, you see the Queen as a real person; sadness, irritations, quiet, and occasionally cracking a joke (very occasionally!). <br /> <br />Very informative too about the relationship with the Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Liked seeing how their different perspectives on the media came together and shaped each of them in a new way. <br />
0800177177|4.0|The most grandiose retelling of the legendary story, and one that casts one of the world's most famous tales of horror as a love story (although certainly a very dark love story), this 1992 version of Dracula features Gary Oldman turning in probably the greatest portrayal of the Count ever. <br /> <br />  Everything in this huge, haunting tale centers around the love story between Dracula (tied in much closer here than in most depictions to his supposed real-life counterpart, Vlad The Impaler) and Mina, the reincarnation of his centuries-ago love, Elisabeta.  Beginning with the origin of Dracula's vampirism following Elisabeta's death, the story then flashes forward to late-1800s Transylvania and Johnathan Harker's famous trip to the Count's ancient castle.  Having dwelled in and terrorized Transylvania for centuries now, the Prince Of Darkness comes by chance upon Harker's locket, in which is a small picture of Mina, the exact image of Dracula's deceased wife.  The passion reawakened in the lord of the vampires, he journeys to London and confirms that Mina and Elisabeta are one and the same.  From there the vampire Dracula preys on inhabitants of the city even as the mortal and emotional side of the beast is reawakened by re-discovery of his true love. <br /> <br />   On a technical scale, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is brilliant, with masterful cinematography, an outstanding dark score by Wojciech Kilar, chilling shadow imagery and extraordinary special effects.  The romantic angle is also a total success.  Where the movie does run into some trouble is here: despite the intensified focus on Dracula and Mina, the Dracula tale is still very much an ensemble piece, and some of the other characters just aren't captured as well as I wished they had been in a movie that was otherwise so great.  It's not the performances per se, it's just that things didn't come together for some of the other characters.  Dr. Van Helsing (although very well played by the always impressiveAnthony Hopkins) comes off cold, arrogant, and curiously unconcerned for the people he's supposedly trying to protect - a far cry from the compassionate, courageous and emminently likable versions of the doctor seen in movies like \\"Horror Of Dracula\\" (with Peter Cushing as Van Helsing).  I think that they may have been thinking that in presenting some sympathetic aspects to the otherwise evil Dracula, they had to counterbalance it by 'darkening' Van Helsing a bit.  I don't think it really worked.  Add to this a somewhat wishy-washy Harker and a Mina who wasn't nearly as developed as her pivotal role would have seemed to dictate, and it detracts a bit from the whole.  The 'lesser' players - Lucy, her three suitors, and the insane Renfield, were all better done in my opinion. Dracula himself is done to perfection.   In spite of the occasional problems with some of the characters, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" keeps coming on strong all the way through - until, tragically, the last five minutes or so.  With a kind of anti-climatic (though far from terrible) ending to what was a vibrant and dramatic movie, plus the difficulties with some of the characters, we're left with a great show but one that fell a bit short of the mark it could have hit. <br /> <br />  Still highly recommended; the weaker parts wouldn't have been so noticeable if 95% of the movie wasn't so awesome.  A very, very good version of the Dracula tale despite a few chinks in the armor.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Michael Streissguth is surely one of God's honored clay vessels from which He pours His rare gift of prose.  I cannot count the times during the consuming literary journey of, `Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison', that I stopped to remind myself, \\"Wait a minute, Streissguth was just a kid in 1968­-he was not at Folsom with John\\" or, \\"No-Streissguth is not absent from all of the photos because he was the one with the camera, he just wasn't there-he was not with the Cash entourage.\\"  The compelling detail seems divine-perhaps it is, for it is related as though from the heart and hand of One­­-who saw the whole thing as it happened.<br /><br />-Rev Jack Shaw; Johnny Cash Show Evangelist
B000OCXMAE|1.0|LP has sold-out.  This CD is completely different from Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and not in a good way.  The cover of the CD shows an Emo-like LP and gives more of a melancholy feel, something they have never represented.  The tracks range from decent to terrible.  I had Hybrid Theory the day of its release and the same with Meteora.  After sitting and listening to MtM I am just sad to see how a label can destroy a band.  They need to stick to what made them special in the future if they hope to maintain a solid fan base.
B000002UB3|5.0|Indeed it is music for the ages. No wonder The Beatles never get out of fashion. The best part is that you don't need to be a Beatles fan to appreciate the fantastic sound and lyrics of Abbey Road, because this album touches your feelings and your soul. Only the greatest group of all times could prepare their final show and get out in their prime like this. From \\"I want You/ She's so heavy\\" to he beautiful \\"Something\\" (That Sinatra called the most romantic song ever and never says I love You) To the final medley that sums the whole experience of The Beatles career, this is an essencial album for any self-respected pop music fan.
0793509602|5.0|I have no idea about playing guitar. I bought this book as a gift for my nephew. He wanted me to order especially this (well known) book and said that it is very useful. Now he is very happy and he uses it a lot.
0393061434|4.0|This autobiography's greatest weakness is Wozniak's style, and this book's greatest strength...  is Wozniak's style.  Woz expresses himself in a manner that is reminiscent of any TV interview you've seen with him.  Basically he writes like he talks - it's almost stream of consciousness.  Early in the book I actually started to believe the book was written for children, and in the final chapter it was confirmed that part of his goal was to inspire youngsters.  However he claims he only decided to go in that direction halfway through, leaving me wondering if the style is a decision independent of such a target audience.  Anyway, the bottom line is that while it makes the book seem authentic and down to Earth, it sometimes also seems a little amatuerish. <br /> <br />As far as the content goes - well I certainly found it interesting.  Maybe that's because I was already a huge fan of Mr. Wozniak's, but I think that all readers interested in invention, engineering, computers, or electronics will find an inspirational story well worth the read.  Indeed, that is what you take away from iWoz - inspiration.  That this very good person (good in the nice, compassionate, and friendly sort of way) is able to use his intelligence, hard work, and perseverance to positively change the world in a big way with few initial resources, is truely the message to take away. <br /> <br />I would like to stress though that this is not a juicy 'tell-all'.  While there are a couple Steve Jobs anecdotes, and a few comments on the politics of early 80s Apple, it's nothing that those who follow these things didn't already know.  Basically, Wozniak ends his personal story sometime in his mid 20s and from then on it's mostly about his work, philanthropy and US Festivals.  There's not much about his three marriages, interests outside of engineering and music, or perhaps what many are curious about - his current relationship with Jobs  and other important figures.  Even the days at Apple in the late70s/early 80s don't give a good feel for the company's day to day existance - Wozniak chooses instead of focus on the engineering/product side of things.  Further, the last 10 years of Woz's life are practically skipped over entirely - even though this seems to be a career minded autobiography, there's no mention of Woz's last startup, Wheels of Zeus, at all! <br /> <br />However, it seems clear that Wozniak very deliberately tried to shape his story to be about his main message - the possibility for anyone with a good idea, perseverance, and enough know-how to change the world.  And Wozniak is able to express it very effectively.  However, I am going to hold out hope that Woz does someday give us another volume filled with much more detail regarding the latter part of his life.
B000O174CM|5.0|Musicals aren't really my thing. Many feel forced as the cast breaks out into song at the most bizarre of times. Cheesy is perhaps the best descriptor, but occasionally I enjoy a good toe-tapping flick if it's done right. And DREAMGIRLS is definitely done right. It certainly ranks up there with MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO as one of the more recently successful musical films, it too being a period piece (covering the late 50s through the early 70s).<br /><br />Acting in these style of films tends to lend itself more to dance moves than actual roleplaying of characters, but there are two highly mentionable performances in Dreamgirls: first time actress Jennifer Hudson of American Idol fame, and a major comeback role for Eddie Murphy. Hudson took home Best Actress trophies from The Golden Globes, The BAFTAs, The Screen Actors Guild and The Oscars for her portrayal of Effie White, the powerful and ultimately embittered lead singer for The Dreamettes. Eddie Murphy as James \\"Thunder\\" Early is surprisingly excellent, perhaps helping wash away the stains of DADDY DAYCARE and THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH from his more recent, acting, downward spiral. Murphy can sing alongside Hudson and Beyonce and hold his own, too.<br /><br />The added entertaining fact about Dreamgirls is that there's an actual story behind the music, making this film much more watchable than many musicals which rely solely on their high notes rather than acting skill. This story is firmly entrenched in the early music industry as a \\"white-washed\\" form of entertainment, separating it from \\"black music\\"...until Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx, JARHEAD), a car salesman in search of more, jumps into the music biz and launches his own record label (Rainbow Records). Foxx's Taylor character is another smashing success for him in that he makes this man both lovable and despised as he turns from caring manager to control freak.<br /><br />Likewise, Murphy's Early character is someone who's moral ground we're never quite sure of. He's a married man with womanizing tendencies, but he's also a musical purist, trying to create sounds that are true to him while at the same time dismantling what he once was (a great, yet small, singing sensation). His fall from grace hits the viewer hard as heroin, time, and his own industry begin taking their toll.<br /><br />But veterans Murphy and Foxx can't hold a candle to newcomer Hudson's performance. She is the crux that holds the entire production together, and she does so with power, grace and a great emotional range. The ending is sure to choke-up many viewers.<br /><br />The only complaint I can lodge against the entire film was within one small section where Effie (Hudson) breaks out into a long chorus about being wronged by Foxx and the other Dreamettes. This seemed rather awkward and I would've liked to have seen this acted out in dialogue rather than burst into song.<br /><br />Still, this is a powerful musical film that deserves much praise ...and has rightfully gotten it.quite sure of.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this album. Ms. Carlile is extremely talented, and a joy to listen to.  I would highly recommend this album.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|Daft Punk has BEEN playing at MY house, now I can sing about it.
B0000AKCLS|4.0|This was a very good blues cd combined with a lot of stevie ray vaughn influence. I would recomend this to others.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Excellent movie -- great fun to watch with kids, even as young as 4.
B00005JPGO|4.0|From the director of Glory and The Last Samurai, Ed Zwick creates an eye opening tale that displays the violence and strife that ripped apart the City of Freetown, Sierra Leone Africa.   <br /> <br />In 1999 Civil War between the RUFs (self proclaimed Freedom Fighters) and the government Army claimed the lives of over 200,000 Africans in Sierra Leone.  Funding for the RUFs came from diamonds, mined by the enslaved people of the region and then exported to the western world.  The education you get on this film will really make you think, if you know don't know anything about it.  Personally, I was already aware of the internal problems of Africa.  It is a country in chaos.  At this time though, the city of Freetown on the west coast was particulary hit hard.  <br /> <br />The guilt trip the movie puts you through is unwarranted, as they state in the movie, the diamonds are mixed with stones from all over the world and then sold.  So there is no way the retailer would know, much less the consumer whether or not the stones they were buying are conflict diamonds.   <br /> <br />The movie follows the characters as they start on different paths but eventually come together to find the Fisherman's son.  Djimon Hounsou gives a strong performance as Solomon, a father desperate to find his family after he is taken by the Rebels to pan for diamonds.  When he finds one bigger then his thumb he hides it amid a raid on the Rebels.  After being taken to jail, Danny Archer (DiCaprio) catches wind of his find and eventually convinces him to split the diamond profits.  Along the way, Archer meets Maggie (Connelly) a journalist tired of writing about the atrocities and no one noticing.  She's looking for hard evidence to write the story of her career and Danny has that evidence since he's been dealing with the illegal aspect of the trade for years.   <br /> <br />The movie is a morality check amidst an action set piece.  The violence and gunfire add adrenaline to what could have beena boring political statement.  DiCaprio is excellent as usual and plays his part with world weary and pecimistic venom.  This is the first movie I've seen him in where he comes across as a man, and not a YOUNG man.  He seems mature, almost too mature for his age, implying he's seen too much for someone of his age.  And his military skills are very convincing.  Connelly plays the other side of the coin, pecimistic as well but hopeful that word will get out and things will change in Africa.   <br /> <br />Eventually, things get wrapped up but not before there is a lot of sacrifice.  Some other reviews state it is a neat and tidy ending, but I disagree.  It doesn't come without death and lives changed forever.  The movie is thrilling and thought provoking even if not perfect.  I recommend it.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I've waited since March 2003 for Linkin Park's next cd with ferverent anticipation.  After hearing that cd today, I wonder how it was possible for them to take 4 years and have over 100 drafts for songs and produce a 43 minute piece of garbage.  The thing that kept repeating over and over again in my mind was, \\"Wow, I can't believe they're pulling a Stain'd\\".  This cd is absolutely horrible, overly melodramatic, way too up-beat in a anti-depressant drug-induced kind of way.  Linkin Park, here's some advice: stop taking all the Prozac, Zoloft, or whatever else you're doing and put some passion back into the music.  I, and everyone I know, feels cheated out of the last 4 years of waiting for this over-produced, over-hyped coporate buy-off.
B000NA28IE|4.0|Eragon stands as a cross between a complete rip off and total homage to stories that the author grew up on.  It's part Dungeons and Dragons, part Lord of the Rings and part Star Wars...yes, I said Star Wars.  You have a young apprentice (Luke Skywalker), his mentor (Ben Kenobi), both of whom have magical abilities (the Force) as the Mentor teaches the student to use them, and use them wisely (don't go to the dark side).  We even have a princess and a Han Solo like character who pops up later.   <br /> <br />But don't let any of that deter you.  It's a classic setup and there is plenty of originality.  The inheritance of the Dragon and the bonding of rider to beast is a very original concept and played out well in the film.  The F/X are spectacular, the scenery and landscape are unspoiled and the pace and dialogue are efficient and well directed.  Jeremy Irons gives a solid and enjoyable performance as the mentor.  John Malcovich, who is only in a few scenes, is good but he doesn't have a lot to do.  Robert Carlyle plays his part creepy and viscious as an evil sorcerer.   <br /> <br />Overall the movie is very enjoyable and even though it is not terribly original you don't find yourself getting too upset about it.  It plays out more like a tribute to past movies and does so with great respect.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|So I'd been looking forward to this album for a couple months. I didn't get my hopes up too much because while I thought that 'The System Has Failed' was a solid album, it didn't live up to my expectations. Megadeth lost their way a little with 'Cryptic Writings' and completely fell off for a while after that. Then 'The System Has Failed' comes out and it seemed like they were making a step in the right direction.<br /><br />'United Abominations' is exactly what 'The System...' should have been. Melodic, well-made, and heavy. Dave's vocals are very good on the album, and while Marty isn't there still, Glen Drover does an excellent job and is an improvement over Poland. The album is great to listen to all the way through, no songs really stick out in my mind, rather, they all shine equally in their own way. Only complaint is the re-make of A Tout Le Monde. If you have heard the original version of the song, this version isn't quite as good (not terrible, though).<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like Megadeth or metal in general this would be a good pick up. If you want to start building your Megadeth collection, this isn't a bad place to start.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I have been anxiously awaiting this album. I really enjoy Linkin Park and loved HT and Meteora. I heard a lot of the rumors about the change in style and maturity and I was open to it. I think that bands need to grow and evolve. I was very excited when I heard \\"What I've Done.\\" I really liked the introspective aspects of the song and hoped this is what the changes were people were talking about. So having listened to the entire album I have to agree with the title to the song \\"Leave Out All the Rest.\\" Apparently I may be the only conservative that is a Linkin Park fan. I found songs like \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" very distasteful. Personally I think musicians should keep their politics out of their music. I fully support their having political opinions, but expressing them in their music can lead to them alienating some or all of their audience.  And as a conservative I was a little disenfranchised because I don't agree with their  take on the war in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina. Between this and the increase in explicit language I was disappointed. I hope the next album is better.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|Very good. Obviously, towards the end they got worse and actually a little boring, but otherwise matrix and matrix reloaded were very good, and the first part of matrix revolutions was good. animatrix is very entertaining(some of them), but some are a bit strange for me.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|This is definitely a grower. Takes about a dozen listens or so to really get its hooks sunk deeply in. But by the time that happens you should be in agreement with most knowledgable fans of good music that Sky Blue Sky is right up there with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as Wilco's best work. <br /> <br />Listen to a song like \\"You Are My Face,\\" the lyrics, the harmony, the shimmering notes leading into the bridge, the slam and the rhythmic tempo change and snarling guitar on the bridge, the passion in the vocals on the bridge, and then how amazingly perfectly they set the song back down into the final verse. <br /> <br />Listen to a song like \\"On and On and On.\\" After slowly and tenderly pleading \\"please don't cry,\\" the song builds up in force (and another great rhythmic change-up) and in the last line pasted here, Tweedy delivers the perfect clincher: <br /> <br />Please don't cry / This world of words and meanings makes you feel outside / Something that you feel already deep inside / You've denied / <br />Go ahead and cry <br /> <br />Just about every single song on SBS has a moment of perfect, brilliant  musical craft like those listed above, a moment where, if you're a musician, you'd say \\"I wish I had thought of that.\\" From the ferocious groove-jams on \\"Walken\\" and \\"Shake it Off\\" to the delicate turnaround on \\"Leave Me Like You Found Me\\" to the monstrous White Album riff on \\"Hate it Here\\" to the soaring vocal after Nels' beautiful solo on \\"Either Way.\\" And the craft doesn't exist just for craft's sake, it exists to let the very direct emotional content of Tweedy's lyrics come soaring through the music. The music has depth and passion underneath its seemingly subdued presentation. And the band sounds amazing.  <br /> <br />Boring? Only if you're not really listening. This record gives me chills every time.
0596007124|4.0|So far it is an easier read for a potentially dry subject.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|So what if they changed. They have the right to change their style. First ppl complain that everything sounds the same and then they complain that it doesn't sound the same. It's called variety and LP has variety. For what it is, this album is good. They poored a lot into this album and should be shown some respect for it. If you're going to be a true LP fan, then understand what they did with this album...  <br />
1878424319|5.0|You must read this book.  It was just the wisdom I needed to get through the challenges life put in front of me.  The four agreements speak to human nature's need for resolution and blame, helping you get through those struggles.
B000006OBQ|5.0|I never had the pleasure of hearing Frank Sinatra live although I passed up some chances that I wished I had taken advantage of. I grew up hearing Frank Sinatra in movies and seeing him on numerous TV specials, I think not quite realizing how truly special a performer he was. It's true as it is with many singers, that his voice and music styling's changed over the years. This album I think is a audio snapshot in time of a world and a place(Vegas), that will never be the same. It is a world that was sophisticated and cool, but with a raw edge and political correctness wasn't even on the horizon. And if anyone would have suggested such a thing they would have been laughed down or thrown out on their ear. This is a great listen,but don't buy it if your looking for easy listening, it is a high energy live concert that should be listened to with the volume cranked up! Franks voice is a little smoky and he is clearly relaxed and is having fun. It isn't like some of his early studio recordings or later for that matter where his voice is a purer instrument. But it is well worth it, I would definately recommend it to have and enjoy.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|i got this cd and after listening to it i went to see her live in concert and the music was more beautiful in person live then the cd thou the cd is still very beautiful
B00005YW4H|5.0|I will not give in depth analysis of the music, or each song. Some part of me wants to, but I haven't the time or the expertise, on some accounts. I bought this CD a few years ago now, and it has always been a favorite of mine.  <br /> <br />With two more popular albums out now, I feel very strongly that this is her best of the three. I understand artists evolving and exploring different things, and I won't downplay that, I just feel that with the songs on this album she really did some things right. Some of the songs here invoke memories of classics. The sentiments of the sultry power of Norah's voice and easy to listen to sound of the music she carries with her make this an album to remember. I don't listen to it often, but it is one that I can always come back to.  <br /> <br />If your musical tastes range anywhere from jazz, blues, classical, pop even(this isn't pop, but I'm willing to give you a chance), or if you just appreciate a good variety, I highly recommend this CD. If you appreciate the female voice and a sort of homage to good blues and jazz singers of past generations, you will probably enjoy this. As I said, in my opinion, this is Norah Jones' best CD, far better than the second, more country-ish one.
6304645635|3.0|I'll buy the DVD if this is ever converted, even though this isn't my favorite Masterpiece Theatre-type adaptation. I am a big fan of the novel, which I think is underrated (it's poorly structured but very original, if a little school-girlish at times). This film follows the book pretty closely -- the ending is a little different but in the spirit of the book.    Toby Stephens' Gilbert was beautiful and compelling (& he does a good northern accent), but his performance here doesn't have quite the zing of Jane Eyre because of Tara Fitzgerald's failure to respond to him. (Half of Ruth Wilson's performance in Jane Eyre is her Nancy-Reaganish adoring gaze at Toby, which enhances him greatly.) I was more drawn to the scenes of Toby and his sister, whose scenes were more touching because it seemed like she was more sympathetic to him. Actually Tara's problem may have been following the book too closely -- you don't really get why Helen & Gilbert fall in love in the book, and you don't really get it in the film either. You certainly see that there are good reasons Helen comes off as cold and disgusted with men, both in the book and the film. I think Tara could have cheated a little on this aspect of the character and responded more to Toby so the love story would make more sense (the scriptwriter could have helped by drawing this out more too).    Rupert Graves was pretty good as Huntingdon, but his kissing was so gross it's amazing Helen doesn't dump him straight away. Actually, the solution to the film's lack of spark may have been to cast Graves as Gilbert and Toby as Huntingdon -- Toby's knack for playing bad guys would have found a wide field in this character.
B0008ENICU|4.0|This movie was fun to watch.  It is the only movie I have ever seen that starred only women.  It is indeed an indictment of social status among women that still holds to this day.  The transfer from film to DVD was excellent and the fashion parade section in Technicolor was amazing.  I can heartily recommend this film for a fun night of viewing. <br /> <br />
B0001I561E|5.0|It is the best and only Arabian movie that I watched when I was younger and I still enjoy to this day. It has great action,
B00067BBQE|5.0|What can I say, I love Evanescence so this DVD is fantastic to put on the TV and sing along to while doing the housework! It reminds me of the great time I had at the concert and of course Amy Lee Rocks!!!
B000GRUS22|4.0|Not bad instrumental, but this CD has the fewest vocals/ lyrics of any of Enigma releases.  You hear Michael Cretu's voice like twice.  What made enigma exotic sounding were the female vocals.  This CD is obscure and devoid of them, maybe a hint in track 4.  His wife Sandra didn't make this release.  Nor did Ruth-Ann Boyle whom vocals were behind Gravity of Love and Follow the Sun was also neglected.  Voyageur was shocking to be sort of folksy, but after a couple plays, it was pretty magical.  Voyageur had one top tier track (hits) and a couple of 2nd tier tracks (good to replay).  Every other release had 1-2 top tier tracks and a bunch of 2nd tier tacks.  A Posteriori is filled with 3nd tier tracks (background music) and one or two 2nd tier tracks.<br /><br />This CD does sound like you are tripping in outer space, but not as ambient as The Thrillerseeker: \\"Synaesthesia\\" nor as exotic as before.  Cretu is the master of difference types of instrumentals and effects, but this CD felt like he was just messing around on a sympathizer and didn't have the varies as his other releases.  Sound like he morphed some of his previous tracks here, but that is true to most of them.<br /><br />As a fan of Enigma with pretty much all his CDs, even the lesser \\"Invisible Man\\", I'll be waiting another 3 years for it next release.  This is my least favorite CD of the series, but would not pass on any of them.  Hopefully, Cretu include more vocals next time.  I will use this CD for background music like Thievery Corporation: Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi.
B000089CJI|5.0|I've been reading a lot of the reviews on this album, and I find some of the negative reviews to be completely absurd. Some claim that the synth sounds rough like ataris. If you listen carefully, you hear that the synth used has beautiful layers of crisp sound. To those who call it boring and monotone- I have to say that you clearly must think beauty only comes in exciting and flashy forms. This album has emotional depth that touched me during an uncomfortable and confusing time. It also introduced me to the wonders of Ben Gibbard. I don't understand the criticism of his vocals. No, he's not American Idol, but he's never off-key or harsh sounding like the Decemberists or Modest Mouse often are. The use of the half-speaking/singing style is the postal service's trademark and I enjoy it's uniqueness.  <br /> <br />Some albums should be respected simply because of the way they have touched people's lives. I dislike it when people diss remarkable bands like the beatles. Half of the value of music is it's interaction with the people who listen to it- not just it's complexity, ingenuity or uniqueness. <br /> <br />That's not to say that this album is lacking in those things, but to say that some people are too quick to judge music and miss out on some things (like Give Up) that demand appreciation.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|This CD is just a horrible follow up to a band that had a great unique sound. Gone is the heaviness and darkness that surrounded their first CD. Instead, it has been replaced with over the top monotone singing by Lee. It worked in the first, but let's face it...the music is what makes her voice good...not the other way around. She belts out notes just fine, only there's no excitement or anything. <br /> <br />Average singing...below average songwriting...nothing catchy.
B00065GX64|4.0|M is an essential film. But this DVD was a little disappointing, I felt. The picture and sound were better than other versions I've seen, but still not as pristine as I would have liked. Special features were so-so. Price was as high as Criterion usually likes it. All in all, I've seen better adaptations of similarly legendary films to DVD.<br /><br />But if you are at all interested in the great films of the past, this is a must-have, and Criterion MUST be kept in business at all costs (wince). So this is a good buy overall.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|The combination of Morricone and Ma is pure perfection.  This CD fills my heart with so much joy that I could just cry.  I listen to it almost daily and have given it away as a gift to my loved ones.  I am captivated by their incredible talents, and I know you will be too.
0740748475|5.0|The product was quick to arrive & in perfect condition.  Thank you so much!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|People's reviews are really disappointing me here. It reminds me of all the people who complain that Korn isn't heavy anymore now that they're finally making some great (though overlooked) albums. Linkin Park is doing the right thing here. They're trying to leave behind the Nu Metal genre that has pretty much fizzled out. Without this move, they probably wouldn't be around much longer. Luckily, they did the smart thing and expanded their sound. Does it sound different? Yes. Is it still Linkin Park? Yes. I remember reading that Mike wouldn't be rapping much, and I was disappointed at first. But the album's depth really makes up for that. The songs sucked me in to the point that I almost forgot about the absence of rapping verses. They're that good. Sure, there are softer songs. But they're executed perfectly. Not to mention, the few heavy songs on here are, in my opinion, heavier than anything else the band has done. Finally we get to hear true hard rock songs without that overly produced distorted guitar. We also get to hear acoustic songs on this album. I would also like to say that Mike's presence is not missing! He co-produced the album, plays most of the rhythm guitar so that Brad can finally play some lead, contributes 2 great raps, and actually sings one song all on his own (which he does amazingly, I might add... kinda reminds me of a deeper version of Ben Gibbard's voice..) Look, if you only like bands like Evanescence, Breaking Benjamin, etc etc (Don't get me wrong, I love those bands) then this album probably isn't for you. But if you have a diverse music taste or can adapt to change for a good cause (LP surviving the test of time), then pick this up while it's still cheap.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Where are the guys from Linkin Park and who are these wimpy imposters? Seriously, this album is very soft and lacks any style that made LP famous in the first place. After listening to LP Underground 6.0 I was so stoked to here what was coming next. Songs like QWERTY, Reading My Eyes, and even the live piano rendition of Pushing Me Away totally rocked. Someone please wake me up from this horrible nightmare known as Minutes to Midnight. I'll just pretend they didn't release this sorry album. All of this coming from a HUGE LP fan!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|First listen I gave this album I was quite dissapointed like, appearantly most here, that the 'hybrid' sound was gone...after 3 more spins, this album actually grew on me a lot. Just forget there ever was an album called 'hybrid' or 'meteora' and judge this one on it's own merit.  <br /> <br />* have to agree with another reviewer, the politcal songs s*ck...enough with the bush-bashing already. when am I gonna get a bin-laden-bashing song? anyone?
B000OCXFCO|5.0|DAVE MUSTAINE!!!  As far as I'm concerned... no more need be said.. Anyone who is a Droog knows exactly what I meen and if reading this are probably nodding in aproval while doing so.  For those of you who are still not quite sure what I'm saying, let me say this: if you like \\"Heavy Metal music\\" in any way, shape, or form, after listening to United Abominations it will be no question to you who the \\"King\\" of metal is, but if your still in doubt or your answer still isn't Megadeth , you can't deny you considered them while thinking of your answer.    The harsh reality of metal and music in general is that we're all expecting that next \\"Peace Sells\\", or \\"Master of Puppets\\", or \\"Reign in Blood\\", or \\"Practice what you Preach\\" albums which all too often leads to much disappointment.  I meen really, in a world that is so quick to criticize, how easy do you think it would be to actually top one of these \\"Monumental Recordings\\"?  As far as I'm concerned topping any of these really isn't possible, but to write something that might compare isn't out of the question.  So far it doesn't seem to have been done yet.  Although I will note that Testament is currently recording a new disk with it's original lineup....Can't wait to hear that one, but as far as Megadeth and United Abominations.....I've heard most of the album and I honestly think this could be the \\"Peace sells\\"/\\"Rust in Peace\\" that we've all been waiting for. I recently saw Megadeth on the opening of the Heaven and Hell tour in Vancouver and got a good earfull of whats to come.  The new songs provide strong proof that Mustaine and Co. are still at the top of the metal chain.  As this is only my opinion, criticize it if you will, I think this album will be a pleaser.
B000083C49|5.0|The Star Trek franchise has taken its fans all over the galaxy.  From its deepest unknown reaches with \\"Voyager\\" to the bridge of the \\"Gorkon,\\" fans have seen plenty.  The peculiar thing is that one of Trek's best tales takes place in late 80's San Francisco in \\"Star Trek IV:  The Voyage Home.\\"  After recovering Spock in \\"Star Trek III,\\" the crew of the Enterprise find themselves as exiles in a Klingon vessel on Vulcan.  When repairs to the damaged ship are completed, Kirk and company decide to return home to accept the penalties waiting for them for their numerous violations from the third Trek film.  When they do decide to go home, a strange ship is spotted making its way to the Federation's headquarters in San Francisco.  Everything in its path becomes inoperable, and it impending arrival on Earth spells certain doom for mankind.  The ship is sending out a signal that cannot be decoded.....until Spock deciphers it as the vocalizations of a humpback whale which, as fate would have, are extinct in that particular age of humanity.<br /><br />Desperate to save mankind, the crew of the Enterprise take their Klingon vessel back in time to San Francisco in the late 80's in order to recover a whale and bring it back with them to their present in hopes to save Earth.  Can they do it?  The only way to find out is to watch this wonderful film.<br /><br />Directed by Leonard Nimoy (Spock), \\"Star Trek IV\\" is one of the best Trek films I've ever seen (and I've seen them all).  The story is very far-fetched, even for Star Trek, but it works perfectly.  There is a bit more humor injected into this tale than the other films, especially during the interactions with late 20th century humanity.  The film does focus quite a bit on Kirk and Spock, but Scottie, Bones, and the rest of the gang have their own moments as well.<br /><br />There are plenty of wonderful special features for folks who enjoy that type of thing.  A wonderful text commentary, production gallery, and a \\"making of\\" documentary are nice, but my favorite special feature was the commentary from Nimoy and William Shatner.<br /><br />Younger fans may cringe at a few of the special effects, especially those involving the cloaked Klingon ship, but this film was (thankfully) made at a time when films weren't all about special effects.  The story is what drives this film, and it is an excellent one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ing of\\" documentary are nice, but my favorite special feature was the commentary from Nimoy and William Shatner.   <br /> <br />Younger fans may cringe at a few of the special effects, especially those involving the cloaked Klingon ship, but this film was (thankfully) made at a time when films weren't all about special effects.

075640407X|5.0|I had my doubts at first (with the spider) but this story [...] right in when Kvothe started the tale of his life thus far.  It is descriptive without being boring and the characters are thought provoking and intense.  The only thing I don't like (and this is true of all authors) is when certain characters call each other's names.  For example, he exchange between Kvothe and Bast.  Why must they say one anothers names at the end of every line when they talk?  No other characters in this book do that, just those two.  Is there a reason?
B000NVIGC0|5.0|It is about time! Once again the band I love is back to playing great songs. I cannot wait to hear this live. Songs like Walken, Hate it here, and You Are My Face are just great. And the opener Either Way is just great. This will be a great album to listen to on those long weekend night drives from Chicago to Wisconsin. I am happy that they are back to doing great songs done without the crap. Guitars turned down is a good things here. The best album I have heard this year. <br />
1881273989|3.0|I learned a lot from this book, but not really in the exact way the author intended.  I think we all know that everyone expresses love in different ways, whatever is most comfortable and natural.  I like the idea of breaking it down into 5 languages - it helped me think about the separate ways to show love, but I don't think love is that simple. <br /> <br />To me a very important aspect of love is disclosing your personal thoughts, feelings, goals, etc.  This is effective communication and should be present in any relationship - I don't think acts of service or gifts can save a relationship if there is no meaningful communication.  Chapman would probably say this is quality time, but I think it's a separate  language on it's own (more than just spending time doing an activity together).   <br /> <br />I don't really think we are \\"born\\" with one main love language that we need the most.  For example, some of those languages are more intimate than others (maybe someone who can only express love in acts of service is uncomfortable with the intimacy of physical touch or talking about feelings -that's not always a good thing).   <br /> <br />Also, he seems to say that everyone is wired a certain way and stays that way for life -I think people change.  The ideas are good, but the reader should just take them as an outline for more complex thought on the subject.  For example, some types of love you might appreciate more from certain people than others.  Every relationship is different.  We need certain types of love more strongly at certain points in our lives than at others too. <br /> <br />There were some other insights that helped me but made me want to study them more in-depth in other people's writings since he just provides surface reasoning.  I also didn't like the way he implies that his ideas are law, and the absolute truth when they are just one theory.   <br /> <br />So, you will probably gain something from it- I would still recommend it, but take it with agrain of salt, and think outside the box that he creates.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|After a brief guitar intro titled \\"Wake\\", Linkin Park's third studio CD is followed by the blistering rocker \\"Given up\\" which ensures that you do wake up. And with that, Linkin Park announces their return after about 3 years.<br /><br />The sound this time pares down the rapping; The dramatic Eminem-like \\"Bleed it out\\" and the marching band/organ/choir sound of \\"Hands held high\\" (with lyrics like \\"like this war's really just a different brand of war/like it doesn't cater the rich...\\") both feature rapping.<br /><br />The album also features more downtempo songs; \\"Leave out all the rest\\" (with lyrics pondering mortality), \\"Shadow of the day\\" (similar in feel to U2's \\"With or without you\\"), the Greenday-like \\"Valentine's day\\", the atmospheric ballad \\"In between\\" (with no drums), and \\"The little things give you away\\".<br /><br />\\"No more sorrow\\" is another raging rocker (with insistent drumming and bellicose vocals) in the same mould as \\"Given up\\", while lead off single \\"What I've done\\" is not unlike \\"Somewhere I belong\\" or \\"Numb\\" from \\"Meteora\\".<br /><br />Standout in my opinion has got to be \\"In pieces\\", a tender piano ballad with skittery beats and touching lyrics, which builds to a razor sharp catchy rocker, not unlike \\"Breaking the habit\\" from \\"Meteora\\".<br /><br />I know loads of fans have been moaning at the new sound but I find it brilliant!!!!
B000F8O4DQ|4.0|Jeff Lynne is a master tunesmith who was always finding ways to expand his pop aspirations within his classical vision. The terrific prog-rock of \\"Fire On High\\" and the symphonic scope of \\"[[ASIN:B0000025DP Eldorado]]\\" were just the preludes to the pop nuggets that surfaced on \\"A New World Record.\\" I always considered this Lynne's most Beatlesque album, from the John Lennon style of \\"Mission\\" to the homage at the end of \\"Shangri-La,\\" Lynne was realizing his rock and roll dreams.<br /><br />This was also the ELO album that contained a rock classic, as Lynne resurrected \\"Do Ya\\" from his days with the move. Containing one of the greatest rock riffs every deployed from the radio, its timelessness is measured by the fact that it still shows up as an attention grabber for advertisements. (Yes, we boomers are getting old...) Along with that rock chestnut, there are also a pair of huge hit singles, \\"Living Thing\\" and the sublime \\"Telephone Line.\\" \\"Telephone Line\\" even became the anchor for a Randy Newman satire on the band (on his CD, \\"[[ASIN:B000026E7W Born Again]]\\"). It's also the moment that the flying ELO logo was introduced, an icon that is recognizable to this day.<br /><br />To that end, this is a classic album from Electric Light Orchestra. The remastering may just be the best of all the ELO re-issues, since the older CD always sounded flat and muffled to these ears. Now the strings pop and swirl like they never did before (or at least since my album was retired), and especially evident on the opening of \\"Tightrope.\\" (I find little to recommend concerning the bonus tracks, however.) If this was one of your AM Radio guilty pleasures in the seventies or if (like me) you blasted this out of your car stereo through 76-77, you're going to have to reset \\"A New World Record.\\"
B00080Z53O|4.0|I had to watch this for one of my classes and I was amazingly surprised by how wonderful the movie was.  I did not mind reading the subtitles in the least.  It was a very powerful, thought provoking movie that inspires discussion.  It is also a very good movie to test your moral issues.  The actors are amazing and the plot is well laid out, with a very artistic approach to some aspects of it.  I thought some parts of the movie were slow though, but overall, I would watch this movie over again gladly.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Rush deserves much respect.  To be around for 33 years as a band is simply amazing.  To still have the same band members since 1975 creating music and selling out venues is astounding.  Rush--they are a progressive band, progressing with musical styles and making the best out of each one...keyboards, no keyboards...who really cares?  Each of Rush's recordings offer something new; subtle changes are evident with each record, if one listens carefully, of course.   <br /> <br />\\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is no different.  With each listen I find one more element that was hidden from me previously.  A true Rush fan will appreciate this recording.  Certainly their songwriting has matured...gone are the days of screaming about Ayn Rand stories and Mark Twain characters (which I miss by the way)...but \\"Snakes\\" deserves the respect from every Rush fan.  I recommend this to EVERYONE!  Buy it now!
0679422714|5.0|I read this book in both English and Chinese versions. I respect the authors' hard work. It is a milestone in revealing Mao's crimes. Western world has been too naive to be cheated by Mao and his accomprices. The government of the U.S. helped Mao and the Chinese communists in the late 1940's. As a \\"gift\\" form Mao, the U.S. received the Korean war with over 50,000 American deaths. Isn't it enough to wake up many American \\"scholars\\"?   <br /> <br />Certainly many Americans hated the corrupted National government (KMT), yet, it is a bad one. However, the communists are much worse. Is it wise, or correct to choose a worse one ? <br />
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I walked into Circuit city today all happy to get the new Linkin Park CD.  After doing so I put it straight in my CD player and listen to it straight through.  I am sorry to say I am disappointed.  I mean the CD is okay but not as hard hitting and or addicting CD as the other two in which I love.  The CD is worth listening too but not as good as you thought it would be. My advice is wait awhile and buy it used when the price goes down on Amazon used and new!!
0887307280|5.0|If you're reading this, then you've probably already begun a new business venture or you're on the verge of doing it.  If you are on the verge, then you're an entrepreneur so that means you ARE going to do it and it is just a matter of timing. <br /> <br />Things are going to be different.  Not just different than your old job.  Nothing is going to be like you expected it to be.  I discovered this the hard way and I fought it tooth and nail.  Only to be undone and forced into management and leadership by necessity. <br /> <br />As this book will show you, more elegantly than my words, you MUST assume these roles.  Even though you are the technical wizard and the expert, someone MUST run the business.  Learn to think of it as it's own challenge and you'll likely learn to love it.  Maybe even more than the core elements of your business? <br /> <br />Good luck and enjoy the path since in business there is rarely a final destination...
1569242739|5.0|I just bought this book and I'm very excited about it.  The only problem I see in the recipes, as a soy-allergic vegan, is in substituting some of the soy products such as soy yogurt, powdered soy milk and vegan margarine (which nearly always has soy).  Nonetheless, this cookbook provides a great basis for experimentation and a lot of fantastic ideas.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|While not a Marine veteran, I am a Gulf War veteran.  And I found very little redeeming about this movie.  There are only two elements of this film that were worth bringing to an international audience.   <br /> <br />1) The \\"Dear John\\" letter board.  For whatever reason, especially confusing given the shortness of this war, there seemed to be a disproportionate number of breakups and divorces among Desert Storm participants.  Perhaps it just seemed that way from the inside, or because suddenly women were everywhere in a combat-zone for the first-time making it easier for soldiers to cheat (not a knock against female soldiers) or because without a draft there were so many eligible young men still left back in the states to cause trouble there.  Whatever the reason, even this important statement in Jarhead was as poorly underdone as a Herfy goat burger (inside joke). <br /> <br />2) The other important element shown in this film was the frustration of waiting.  Sitting in the desert and keyed up for 5 months with no proper outlet or release.  Again, they missed their cue there.  I do not believe for a second that a Marine NCO would allow his recon unit on the edge of a battlefield to behave in such an undisciplined and coarse manner.  Especially in front of civilians and worse, reporters.  This stinks a little bit to much of the early stages of Heartbreak Ridge before the Gunny shows up. <br /> <br />The main character/author is nothing short of a crybaby wimp.  His is not a personality that can be suppressed throughout Boot Camp, AIT, and TIS.  He should have never been in a warzone because he should never have been allowed to be a Marine.  The closest this guy should have gotten to the military is by working for the Air Force MWR (another inside joke). <br /> <br />I see this movie as an insult to the Corps and the military at large.  Its timing was very suspect.  Its time of filming and release was during the early stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom, a war that isdepicted by liberal Hollywood and the media as being very unpopular.  Touted and sold as a patriotic celebration of our military, its really just another example of how the left \\"supports our troops\\" but cutting their feet out from under them.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone should see this movie.  It is shocking at times but perhaps we all need to be shocked into thinking about our lifestyles, how we can change, what needs to be done to prevent further global warming.  I think it's  well done and thorough, explains issues well so viewers understand.

Notice the lyrics -they are a special part of this album. Moody, violent, revolting, political, beautiful. This is powerful -brutally honest expression. It literally makes you feel ill.

0743298020|3.0|The story was very interesting and could have been so much more. It lacked that extra little push to make it totally scandalous like it should have been. It was certainly a page-turner yet a let-down at the same time.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Man how DiCaprio has grown...from the little skinny no-body on Growing Pains, to the muscular heart throb on Blood Diamond, among other movies...  Both Dicaprio and Hounsou seek the same diamond, but for different reasons.  Dicaprio wants to get paid and Hounsou wants his son back.  It's very intreguing and moving, two human stories with an outcome that will have tremendous impact on our lives today.  Lies, denial, and bloodshed, for what...a rare pink diamond that is worth far less than any human life...

055358202X|5.0|Many people have died since the beginning of the War of the Five Kings. The death tally now includes Robb Stark, Renly Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon, and Balon Greyjoy. The major players left in this monstrosity of a war are Stannis Baratheon and newly appointed Tommen Baratheon, who has been rendered a powerless figurehead by his grasping mother, Cersei Lannister. Cersei's mind is troubled  by the recent murder of her father, Tywin, by her brother, the Imp Tyrion, and Tyrion's subsequent disappearance from the realm. What starts as a simple search and find mission becomes a relative obsession for a few hell-bent on glory from their beauteous queen's hand. Cersei scours the realm for Tyrion, but he has vanished, along with his fair young wife, Sansa Stark, who has actually gone under the protection of her mother's former childhood friend Petyr Baelish, who is now master of the Eyrie after the murder of his wife, Lysa Arryn.<br /><br />Brienne of Tarth has sworn to Jaime Lannister, Cersei's twin brother and ardent lover, that she will rescue Catelyn Stark's lost daughter (believing Arya Stark long dead) and restore her to her rightful place in Winterfell. Along the way she encounters many people and misadventures that force her to grow as a maiden warrior. Meanwhile Arya, now called Cat of the Canals, has taken residence in the free city of Braavos where she studies with the faceless men, searching for herself.<br /><br />Jaime Lannister, the once proud head of the King's guard, has resumed his position as such, even with his newly maimed sword hand. He refuses all notions of becoming anything more than that, much to his twins annoyance. Added to this is Samwell Tarly, a member of the night watch, has been sent on a mission from Jon Snow to take Maester Aemon to the Citadel in Oldtown to learn what he can of the others.<br /><br />Added to the typical characters in this series are several new points of view. The newest narrators are Pate, Aeron Damphair Greyjoy, Areo Hotah, Cersei Lannister, Asha Greyjoy, Arys Oakheart, Victarion Greyjoy, and Arianne Martell. They join the existing narrators of Samwell Tarly, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Brienne of Tarth,  and Jaime Lannister. These new voices not only add to the story but completely enhance it, in that several of the characters bring in the cultures of the Iron Islands and  the Dornish  as well. These diverting storylines enrich the already existing plotlines and add a lot more flavor with new and intriguing characters.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book grabbed me the most so far in the series. Don't get me wrong, I understand that it cannot stand on it's own without the previous three books, however I think this book gets a bad rep in the series. Having worked in a book store the past few years I was present when this book came to the shelves, and I heard all of the subsequent disappointments that many folks seemed to have with this book. Now, I totally understand that the negation of certain key characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, Daenerys, Bran Stark, and Davos Seaworth) in this book can be frustrating, but I only felt that their lack helped to hone the stories of other key players whose voices have thus far gone unheard... like Cersei Lannister for instance. This book is her book. She is the strongest driving force in this novel, and one of the strongest in the series, and the relationship between her and Jaime is explained so well, once and for all, that it definitely fleshes her out to an insane degree, though it does not in any way shape or form make her an empathetic character. I do miss certain people, most notably Jon Snow and Dany, but I deeply appreciate that Martin took the tactic that he did in order to carefully craft and explain one of the most vile heroines ever to grace the pages of fiction.<br /><br />I adored this book.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is a must have for HD. I've had my HD TV for 2 years now (1080i), and this has to be the best quality DVD I've seen.<br /><br />I don't buy many movies, but this one was one I felt would be worth every penny. We rented disc one from Netflix, and after watching it felt why rent the rest when owning and wathing a few times would be better.<br /><br />Your eyes and ears will be in sensory overload as you watch this. The crispness, the sound, the colors, the amazing cinematography. You'll soar with flocks of birds, swim with the elephants, and see wildlife and scenery you've never seen before, and that's just in the first disc.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This my friends is the album that will define Linkin Parks career. When all is said and done we will look back and know that this album is their Black Album(Metallica), their American Idiot(Green Day), their Joshua Tree(U2). This album for better or worse is that moment. They wanted a change, they didn't want to be pigeon-holed into a sound and they've succeeded. Gone are the moments that made Hybrid Theory and Meteora the upper echelon of the rap/rock, nu-metal movement. They've been replaced by a cleaner, softer sound. A different sound to be sure, a non-Linkin Park sound(except that its still Linkin Park). The issue at hand is NOT how does MTM compare to their previous works but rather does it stand on its own? My opinion, it does and it does so with flying colors. Sure fans will be divided and as someone said before, legions of 14 year old girls will flock to LP if Leave Out All The Rest is released to radio, but none of that matters. What matters(to me at least) is that LP has come into their own. They've matured, they've changed and they've done it just as well, if not better, than their previous albums. Everyone hears something different. Everyone has their own style that they prefer, maybe this is it, maybe its not. I simply ask you this... Listen to the album, but listen to it not as a LP album, but as simply an album. Don't compare it to their other albums. This is a seperate work, only then can you truly decide.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|Minutes to Midnight...Should be more like Minutes Till I Slash my wrists, or maybe Minutes Till I Jump Off a Bridge. Very big disappointment on Linkin Parks part. With the exception of 3 to 4 songs you might as well take the CD and use it as a coaster when you swallow 40 pills and take a swig of JD. I have been a huge fan of Linkin Park since day 1 and all I have to say is congratulations Linkin Park you have now joined the Emo race. Put on your girl pants and run to the nearest store to pick up this amazing album. Lets just hope that this is all a big joke and Linkin Park will grace us with their presence at a later date.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|Two gripes I have with reviews in general: <br /> <br />First, what exactly is alt-country? Music has been categorized to hell, it doesn't even make sense anymore. I think Jeff Tweedy had it right when he said that Wilco is, and always has been a rock & roll band. That is the only genre actually means anything in the context of Wilco. <br /> <br />Second, what does it mean when people say things like, \\"it's pink floyd meets Eagles\\" ? If Wilco was composed of Roger Waters and Don Henley, I'd understand. Stop comparing Wilco to everybody and realize that the only thing Wilco is, is Wilco. This is not true for every band, but Wilco is definitely about at unique as they come. <br /> <br />Moving on to my other gripes: I don't understand why people don't expect bands to evolve. The best musicians grow and tinker with their sound. Wilco has changed their sound with every single record. Why are people surprised when Sky Blue Sky sounds different from A Ghost is Born and YHF?  <br /> <br />Lastly, this isn't so much of a gripe but more of a disagreement, I don't think it takes long to like these songs at all. They are all very accessible. The first time I heard this album I knew it was something special. Nels Cline adds another dimension to this band that takes it to a whole other level. Wilco goes from slow and contemplative with Either Way, Leave me (Like you Found Me) and Please be Patient with Me, to beautiful guitar Solos in Impossible Germany and Side with the Seeds, to folky in What Light. Tweedy even manages to sound happy in Walken. All in all, this is one of the best albums to come out in years, and does nothing but add to the collection of one of the greatest bands out there.

0140177396|5.0|If you ever wondered what the ultimate devotion of a true friend is like, then Of Mice and Men is the book for you.  In this novel John Steinbeck explores the interesting lives of two men, Lennie and George.  Lennie is a man with a big body and an even bigger heart. Lennie is the kind of gentle giant who loves anything soft. George is the opposite of Lennie. George is a small dark man with sharp features.  The two men travel to California in search of work.  When they arrive at a ranch they find more then just work. They make new friends, new enemies and get into trouble.  Lennie has a learning disability and is a little slow, and George said he would always watch out for Lennie. In their time at the ranch they meet a few different characters, one of which is a woman who happens to be married to the bosses' son Curly. Curly is a small jealous man who picks fights for random reasons. Curly's wife is a flirtatious woman who loves the attention she receives from the men on the farm. One event that shows Georges strength and the lack of his ability to make good judgments, was when Curly stormed into the bunkhouse accusing Lennie of having and affair with his wife. When Curly throws a punch Lennie catches his fist and easily crushes it. This event only added to Lennie and Georges problems. George and Lennie are working to save money so they can live a life they always dreamed of.  After a series of unfortunate events the plot takes a sorrowful turn. This is a very entertaining book that has a little bit of everything: comedy, drama, action, suspense and tragedy. This book shows what a true friend would do for another friend. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. We can all learn from Lennie and George

0743442539|5.0|This book centers on the swan song of retiring, or soon to retire, Alec Leamas.  After losing numerous agents to the German counterintelligence, he is asked `I wondered whether you were tired? Burnt Out?. . . one can't be out in the cold all the time; one has to come in from the cold.\\"<br /><br />And, so we watch the spy come in from the cold, become alcoholic, fail at his post-spying jobs and become an inept member of Britain's civil society. He even punches out a man, and for breaking his jaw he is ordered to spend three months in prison.  When released, the \\"other side\\" takes him in - offering him deserving  money that his own would never offer.<br /><br />Crossing the line in espionage or covert operations is not like leaving your job for better pay.  The people who are behind the scenes masterfully set the ball in motion in this chess game of counter-espionage during the times of the cold war.  This was written in the early 1960's - when the Berlin Wall (which is referenced at the beginning and end of the book) represents \\". .. A perfect symbol of the monstrosity of ideology gone mad.\\"<br /><br />This book interestingly applies to today's news. Now our own government stands back after being implored to stop building a similar wall in Baghdad in April of 2007 - are we now like our enemies of that war? Are we becoming ideologically mad?<br /><br />The ability to move the chess pieces ahead of the reader is what makes this mystery so marvelous. Le Carre created a style in this book which has been copied so successfully in the future.  Cinema's \\"No Way Out\\" and each \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" prove the public has a great  interest in such surprise twists. Television's \\"Man From U.N.C.L.E.\\" and \\"The Avengers\\" each borrowed from Le Carre's formula.<br /><br />Now, that we have read or watched this style on numerous occasions, the novelty of this book is not as pronounced.  But, it is the founding father of such literature.  And, to that we thank Le Carre. I recommend reading this book which should always be enjoyed and rememberedecommend reading this book which should always be enjoyed and remembered
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Even though it's different it's still great.  I liked their old sound a lot, but this is just as good in my opinion.  Money well spent!
B000059QYB|4.0|<br />   Firstly, I'll just say that I rate AC/DC as the kings of the rock riff. What you get in Billy Idol's music, especially the good songs, are just a taste of a great guitar riff or lick. I.e. the riff/lick doesn't permeate the whole song, just a really cool bit of the song. <br /> <br />   I'd say that this would have to be due to the guitar work of Steve Stevens. The songs that I rate highly on this compilation are: <br /> <br />Hot In The City, White Wedding (Part 1), Eyes Without A Face, and Flesh For Fantasy. <br /> <br />   There are other good songs of course, and politically active songs like \\"You don't need a gun\\", as relevant as ever in light of the frequent massacres that occur in the US, always involving guns.  <br /> <br />   For examples of what I mean by great \\"cameo\\" guitar bits in songs, check out \\"Eyes without a face\\", which has a very fluid and mellow guitar break, and \\"Flesh for fantasy\\" which has a spiky and dirty sounding guitar riff with a cool synth drum beat. In AC/DC songs, often the riff forms the backbone of the whole song. With Billy Idol, the guitar is often the cherry on top of the ice-cream.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|NOBODY DOES IT LIKE MEGADETH!!! THIS IS A ROCKIN ALBUM FROM BEGINING TO END! MEGADETH CAN BE USED AS AN EXAMPLE TO A BUNCH OF NEW, OR UPCOMING BANDS OUT THERE TO SHOW THEM HOW ITS DONE!
B000001YOW|5.0|My review is based after only few listening of this cd, in fact, I am new to Porcupine Tree, a friend of mine suggest to get some cd's of the band and I can tell that I am very pleased of what I have heard.  The more I listen, the more I like !  If you are a prog music fan and you are looking for something new, you can't go wrong with Porcupine Tree. <br />Very good cd from the beginning to the end.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Be weary of people who rate this album 5 stars.  5 means perfection, music that will stand the test of time.  This, citizens of rock; is not even close.       I will be honest, I like me some Linkin Park.  I have seen them twice in concert and in general, I enjoy their music.  I don't worship them or write 8 page diatribes in their defense if someone decides to flame them.  This album has to be heard to be believed.  I was moved by it, moved to come on here and warn people that this not what you expect.  Whatever idea you have of this album it wont be that.  There are no punch to the songs.  They removed every musical aspect which made them, them.  I mean, honestly the songs simply put, the songs aren't any good. <br /> <br />In a interview they said they made hundreds of songs and these made pick.  Linkin Park, did you even listen to this album before you presented it to us, your fans?  This is awful you should be ashamed of yourself, go to your room.
B000002HPT|4.0|Very good cd...played by amazing musicians, very heavy sometimes, quite soft and commercial on some songs but overall, a very good album to listen to.
B000002KFJ|4.0|By most accounts, Black Sabbath's stride began to waver a bit with the release of Sabotage.  In strictly relative terms that may be true.  Any band is bound to peak sooner or later, and Sabotage is clearly the day after.  No new ground is broken and the performances occasionally lack Sabbath's typically tight delivery.  Nonetheless, Sabotage stands quite nicely on its own merits and offers enough to keep any fan happy.  On no other album will you find Bill Ward working as hard as he does pounding out Symptom of the Universe.  Megalomania is an unheralded classic, displaying great production and quintessential Sabbath song construction.  The rest of the album includes similar efforts except Supertzar which is just weird, and ends, thankfully, before it ever really begins. For the most part Black Sabbath are guilty only of resting on their laurels, but, given their credentials at this point, zero growth isn't necessarily a bad thing.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|Much of the music of Crosby, Stills, and Nash thrived beautifully from the presence of three (or four) amazing voices and layering of rich acoustic and electric guitar work.  The music of Neil Young was always the odd man out with that quartet.  It isn't that the presence of CSN damaged Neil's music but the simple fact is, Neil Young's songs never needed three voices, layered instruments, or overdubs.  In fact, the power and beauty of his songs seems to emerge with more emotive force the more you peel off those layers.  This famous bootleg-turned-CD offers brilliant proof of that.  Some of the most powerful song performances of Neil Young's career are in this concert and it consists entirely of one voice and one instrument (guitar or piano).  That happens to be the perfect set of ingredients for a Neil Young song.  The lack of harmony and accompaniment actually reveals the stark power of Young's compositional skills and the poetry of his lyrics better than any of the studio work he did as part of the famous CSNY super-combo.  As much as I have always loved \\"Harvest\\" this performance actually strikes me as a peek at \\"Harvest as it was meant to be.\\"  Songs like 'Old Man' and 'Needle and the Damage Done' have always been beloved as solo acoustic numbers.  But to hear 'A Man Needs a Maid' with the orchestration stripped away is a revelation I never expected as the song becomes more beautiful and powerful with less embellishment.  Anyone who values Young as a performer would naturally seek out any live recording they can get.  But those who are more enamored with his songwriting should also seek out this CD because if anything, the simplicity here shines a brilliant light on his compositional skils.  I hate seeing people label certain things as a \\"must have\\" but to anyone who loves the music of Neil Young, this CD ... well, it is.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park should've stayed with their original sound.  This album is background music at best.  Very disappointing.  As fans, we should figure out what we have to do to make them really mad and return to what they do best...be angry!

B000O174CM|5.0|Now let me explain.  It is not the Broadway play.  It couldn't be.  That was a masterpiece.  There was after all Jennifer Holiday. I saw the movie twice.  The first time I thought it didn't really hang together.  The second time I started to appreciate Bill Condon's concept and thorouhgly enjoyed it. Now here's the DVD with extended and deleted scene intact. <br />Well, Mr. Condon, if some of these scenes were included, Dreamgirls would have become one of Hollywood's best musicals. It's almost there and better than Chicago. The Steppin to the Bad Side is as good as anything in West Side Story.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album isn't awesome, but it is great.  Good to see Dave rose above System Has Failed.  I felt that album had a handful of good tunes and the rest was garbage.  Here we see Megs back on the track to metal.  Alot of the riffing reminds me of Rust In Peace, specifically Take No Prisoners.  I don't know if this will be Dave's swan song or not, he has hinted at it, but I'm sure sales will be great.  My biggest beef is that the Out on the Tiles track is only on the Japan import.  I'm pretty mad about that.  And, that being said, I'll probably trade away my copy and get that one when it's available.   <br />Best Tracks: <br />Sleepwalker <br />Washington is Next! <br />Blessed are the Dead <br />Play for Blood <br />A Tout le Monde--I like it better than the original <br />You're Dead <br />Burnt Ice <br /> <br />The only other complaint is when there is so much talking instead of singing.  I don't like it and I don't see those tracks translating well to live performances.  It seems like during the talky songs, the music is background filler and rather boring.  Some of it is like carry over from the last album.  Hopefully if there is a followup to this there won't be anymore talk tracks.  Dave has a great voice in my opinion and he surpassed Hetfield's ruined voice years ago.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|I love this CD!  The blues are becoming a lost art to the \\"younger\\" generation and thank goodness for Kenny Wayne!  Take a listen to this CD and you will hear so many of today's popular musical offerings that are copied from the blues.  It is true what I have been hearing for years - the blues is what inspired Rock and Roll, Funk, R&B, etc....  Sit back, listen and enjoy, by the end of the CD you will have a smile on your face, a tap in your toes and to top it off, a wonderful musical history lesson. I was so fortunate to catch Kenny Wayne on tour in April, he brought along some blues legends - so if he comes to your town, you better run, not walk, for tickets. You won't be disappointed.

0060899220|4.0|This book was recommended by several people I work with, as they knew I enjoy getting a glimpse of life, not otherwise known about. This book didn't disappoint. What a wild subculture exists, just beyond the wall from the general dining public! Even though this is one man's experience and perspective, and every kitchen may not be the way he describes, this voyeristic view into the world he has seen is captivating! If you are not easily offended by crude situations and language, this book should be on your stack to read. And potential readers should also know that this book is not so much about what the kitchen and wait staff do to the food as it is about the personal lifestyle and kitchen adventures of the people in the industry. Really a good book.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|If I could I would give this album no stars.  This was a major let down as I was looking forward to this album for so long.  The songs are just such a bland and boring departure.  I am all for a band trying new things, but be sensible about it.  Maybe only do this kind of departure or 2 or 3 songs and then do your standard stuff.  I should have known this album would have been pretty bad just by the simple fact Rick Rubin produced it.  He has a thing for taking well established bands and making them do sub-par albums.  I've tried listening to this album several times through to give it a fair shot, and there are some songs that hand great potential, but didn't quite make the grade.  I have a feeling this album is going to alienate a lot of standard LP fans.  At least I will still have their tour to look forward to.

B000K7UBTI|4.0|I found this highly watchable in spite of the mixed reviews here.  Firstly, Iron Man works really well in animation.  Secondly, the soundtrack here was impressive and gave this a big movie feel.  Well scored.<br /><br />Iron Man has undergone many incarnations and this story is unlike the actual origins of Iron Man that many older fans know.  It retains the spirit of Iron Man however, and that's what counts.  The ending is unexpected but hopefully there will be further developments in the series.  3 & 1/2 stars.
B000002I55|4.0|This is a great album, but as other reviewers have noted, Ornette has done better.  For example, his colloboration with Pat Metheny, Song X, is far more adventurous, intense, and powerful.  This was a groundbreaking album in its day, and it's still really good.  The liner notes from the original LP said that Ornette and his double quartet went into the studio, jammed for 37 minutes and 3 seconds, recorded it, and left the studio.  The fact that there is a track called \\"First Take\\" (literally, a first take of Free Jazz) shows that this is false.  Ornette's music was composed for the most part before the improvisation started.  Ornette is an amazing musician, and this album is great, but there are better albums by him (Song X, The Shape of Jazz To Come, Change of the Century, and Chappaqua Suite).
B00005JPD0|3.0|Dejavu was a great movie with it always keeping you on edge.  You anticipate what will happen each second prior to its happening.  What this movie lacks is a solid ending.  The movie concludes with the two main characters meeting each other again.  I would have liked to have seen what events in the future the act of going in the past changed.  We know that Denzal came out a hero, saving the womens life and the lives of all the people on the ship, but we dont know how his actions altered the future that he already lived.  Another problem with the movie is that it is too predictable.  I had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen and how it was going to end.  I had ideas of how the future would have been changed, but those went unconfirmed.  Besides that, the movie was good.  There was a decent amount of action, and the scienctific ideas brought into play made it very interesting.  I like how they toyed with the idea of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, making it seem like a somewhat believable physics concept.  Overall, I give this movie a 3 out of 5.
B000002OR4|5.0|this soundtrack compliments one of the greatest films ever made. that being said, this can also stand on its own as one of the greatest classical music ever composed. just be sure to keep a towel next to you. i was just hearing the samples and i am already crying my a** off. enjoy
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Ok first off, if your a Nu-metal junky than you will not like this album period.  They experimented alot in this album and most of the songs are pretty soft.  Theres about 3 heavy-ish songs.  This album is very different from LP's first album.  Theres very little rock-rap if any.  Its mostly Chester singing and Mike only does 2 songs.  If your expecting the old LP than you'll be disappointed but if you come in with an open mind and welcome the change than you'll enjoy it.  I think Meteora showed that LP was progressively getting softer so this isn't really a surprise to me.  Every song on this album is unique which is nice because a lot of their older work sounded similar to eachother.  I was disappointed with a couple of the songs on this ablum but I enjoyed almost every song.  Like I said, If you come in with an open-mind than you will enjoy this album.  If your expecting the old LP than you will disappointed.  Simple as that.
B0001KZM4I|4.0|The music on this album is great and the album repackaging and the addition of a new CD with outtakes and alternate takes enhances the value of the original album.     IMHO, the worst part of the repackaging are the new comments by Mike Scott in the CD. They are a mixture between self-indulgence and own pride not everybody would be pleased with.    If you are looking for a Waterboys album, get this one or Fisherman Blues.
B000MV9026|5.0|I really can't believe that smb can not like this film at all. I watched it after my mom that found it very \\"cute but a bit boring\\".<br /><br />We watched it with my husband (who mostly likes films like \\"Training day\\"<br /><br />or \\"Saw\\") and we both were charmed by almost little thing in this movie:<br /><br />kindness, charm, bravery, love and power to be different.<br /><br />Really nice film with nice animation, good music and voices of favorites<br /><br />actors.<br /><br />It's amazing movie for all people of all ages. I'm sure that children would be trilling from it. Think it's amazing example for kinds of how one person (penguin or human) can make a difference in the world.<br /><br />I recommend it to everybody - if you not sure that you wanna buy it - at least rent it. You will take no regrets.
B00007GZR5|4.0|Very good movie. I saw his several years ago and enjoyed it then, and felt it was worth having in my library.
0783240287|3.0|Let me start by stating this is perrenial favorite of mine.  I've attended several productions of this from Tuacahn to high school productions.  My daughters drove me nuts playing the soundtrack.  I finally broke down and bought the DVD.    Let me also state that we have high Christian standards.  This did not meet those standards.  My wife and I both flinched several times while viewing this version.    Some of the costume are very risque' and some of the behaviors are very inappropriate.  The Potipahr's wife scene was just short of brazen nudity and overly sexual.    The narrator was not up to the caliber of other performances I've seen and Richard Attenborough did a mediocre job as Jacob.  Donny Osmond played Joseph well and continues to deliver the level of vocal performance he was known for in the 70's.    I liked the sets and the creativity, although a 'for film' version would have been nice.    The sound was poor.  We had to adjust it several times during our viewing, especially in the beginning.    Minus one star for inappropriate material.  Minus one star for poor sound.  My wife and I rate this at PG-13, drifting slightly towards R.
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is an extremely interesting read, and I would suggest it to most who enjoy reading.  It makes you think, and understand what's going on in your brain just a little more.  I highly recommend this, especially for people in, or entering, the psychology field.  I can't wait to read The Tipping Point.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|There's a few songs that are pretty sweet like \\"In Pieces\\" and \\"What I've done\\" but a lot of this album's other songs sound drastically different than Linkin Park's original style found in Hybrid Theory. I understand the band was trying to be experimental with this album but there's so much change you can make before you start sounding completely different. It definitely feels like I am listening to a different band.  <br /> <br />For instance, the first 2/3rd of \\"Given up\\" sound like it came out of a grunge band. The remaining third of the song switches to a more heavy metal style. I was pretty pleased with it being a metal fan myself but still it's no Linkin Park.  <br />You then, have songs with completely different and contrasting sound, shifting from a somewhat Hardcore Rock as aforementionedly presented to a softer genre that I would be embarassed to call Rock. \\"Leave out all the Rest\\", \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"Shadow of the Day\\" would be an example of this. The latter in my opinion sounds a bit like Coldplay.  <br />Finally you have songs with Mike Shinoda MCing throughout the whole track (Hands Held High, In Between) which is fine I guess but it sounded a whole lot better when the rapping was accompanied with Chester's hard vocals and Hahn's awesome mixings, melodiously orchestrated together in one track.  <br />Anyway, I could go on and on but all in all I was disappointed with this album... <br />
0385340559|5.0|There are many reasons to admire Jack Reacher, the taciturn hero of Lee Child's \\"Bad Luck and Trouble.\\" He is a low-maintenance individual who travels with just his passport, ATM card, and toothbrush. He is incredibly strong and an expert in weaponry and hand-to-hand combat, and will go out of his way to protect the people he likes and respects.  Reacher is also intelligent, intuitive, and creative; by thinking out of the box, he usually finds the answers to whatever questions are puzzling him.<br /><br />In \\"Bad Luck and Trouble,\\" Reacher has a reunion of sorts with three of his buddies from the army,  Frances Neagley, Karla Dixon, and David O'Donnell.  They reunite because of a tragic event:  Calvin Franz, who worked with them years ago in the military police, was thrown out of a helicopter in the California desert after suffering unspeakable torture.  The victim left behind a wife and little boy.  Three other MPs from the same special investigations unit, Jorge Sanchez, Tony Swan, and Manuel Orozco, have disappeared, as well.  Reacher and his remaining ex-colleagues band together to find out what happened to these men and why.  He is also plotting revenge:  \\"There are dead men walking, as of right now.  You don't throw my friends out of helicopters and live to tell the tale.\\"  The slogan that Reacher and the others live by is: \\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"<br /><br />Lee Child's Reacher is a modern day cowboy, who generally travels alone from town to town, minding his own business.  Yet, somehow, \\"bad luck and trouble\\" always manage to find him.  This time, in a refreshing variation on Child's usual formula, Reacher takes his place as the commanding officer of a tightly knit and focused team, each member making his or her own invaluable contribution to the investigation.  Neagley is smart and tough, and she has plenty of money to bankroll their operation.  Dixon is a forensic accountant with a sharp mathematical mind, equal to Reacher's.  O'Donnell is fast, powerful, and fearless.  This formidable foursome is pitted against a group of ruthless adversaries who always seem to be one step ahead of them.<br /><br />Child has created a cadre of well-drawn heroes, and the fast-paced action never flags.  The terse, often dryly humorous dialogue is enormously entertaining.  In addition, some nifty mental puzzles are thrown in to challenge the investigators' powers of deduction; brawn without brains just doesn't cut it in today's world.  On the downside, the villains are one-dimensional and the finale is a bit too pat to be believed, even in a fantasy such as this.  Still, this novel is great escapist fun; it will have wide audience appeal among long-time Reacher aficionados, and it will probably earn the author a host of new fans, as well.O'Donnell is fast, powerful, and fearless.

B00005JNS0|4.0|...That is, my son would have loved this when he was a kid.  And let's face it, this film seems mostly made with little boys in mind - bright, shiny cars and trucks racing along like so many HotWheels.  The visuals were stunning, the humorous caricatures very droll and amusing.  The story is basically a hot-shot Nascar-like celebrity learning about life and humility in a small town, presumably in the California outback.  However - and this is a personal \\"however\\" - I must be too old for envisioning a world where the dominant (indeed, only) lifeform is the car.  Ford Prefect made that same mistake in \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\".  In Disney's 1952 original car film, \\"Susi the Little Coupe\\" (who looked as if she would have fit into this movie just fine) there were humans around in background roles, and I think a human audience would have been less unsettling than an audience full of cars.  But maybe I am just being picky.
B000O178BY|5.0|NIN has always something to say with their new recordings.This record is not Pretty hate machine or the downward spiral but is the return of NIN's more electronic way, with slow, hypnotic and noisy songs with the incredible voice of Trent Reznor making it more enjoyable
B000OCXMAE|4.0|A good number of my friends look at me with mild disgust when I suggest that Linkin Park owns a unique brand of musical genius.  But as someone who listens to large quantities of music from mainstream to indie, I contend that no one has mastered the art of rap-rock like they have (Quarashi is the only band I can think of that even belongs in the same neighborhood).  There's an almost mathematical perfection to both Hybrid Theory and Meteora, their first two full, non-remix albums.  Ultimately, Linkin Park has offered something that I couldn't find anywhere else. <br /> <br />I'm not one to say that bands shouldn't change and mature.  But, honestly, I didn't want to see Linkin Park change, because they're already unique.  They have changed in Minutes to Midnight, and the metamorphosis isn't a positive one. <br /> <br />Upon a first listen, two things are glaring:  <br /> <br />1) Mike Shinoda's rapping presence is minimal.  I've always preferred Chester's raspy vocals to Shinoda's rapping, but he's so underutilized on this album that you realize that he's an integral part to the Linkin Park sound.  The fusion of his rapping and Chester's vocals combined with excellent beats and melodies makes the band.  <br /> <br />2) There are a lot of songs that almost qualify as ballads.  The good news is, most of them are pretty pleasant.  Chester really does have a great voice- even when he isn't screaming and rasping.  The bad news is that they take up slots on the album that I wanted to see filled with the rap-rock-electronica-metal that immediately entranced me on Hybrid Theory and Meteora. <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, this album is the type that grows each time you play it, but it simply doesn't do what fans of the band wanted it to do.  There are a few hints of where the band has been.  Stand-outs What I've Done, Bleed It Out, Given Up, and No More Sorrow all convince me that this may actually be Linkin Park and not some evil clone band from Mars. <br /> <br />Again, the album isn't bad- I enjoyed it even on the first listen, but most of it doesn't really do anything to distinguish itself from the type of alt-rock that you can find almost anywhere. 3.5 STARS
B000002LCB|5.0|wonderful soft music makes one dream
B000002GKT|5.0|After reading one extremely positive review for this album after another, I thought it would be a wise idea to buy the thing...    and I'm glad I did.    All the reviews are correct- simply put, this album cooks.  This is actually my first exposure to Humble Pie, and I think owning this album was a good choice because it's about as consistently pleasing as live rock music can get in the early 70's.  Lots of heavy guitar jams, solid bass work, and drumming that blows my mind.  Oh, and the sound quality is about as good as it gets too.     The only minor complaints I might have are that \\"I'm Ready\\" is one or two minutes overlong, and \\"Rolling Stone\\" isn't a song I feel like giving a listen to everyday (because of the talk-singing that occurs during most of it) but other than that, yeah, all the reviews are exactly accurate.  You must buy this album if you like your classic rock loud and heavy.      Oh, and I also want to point out, for those of you who might be familiar with the band Black Sabbath and the Sabotage album, that the song \\"Hole in the Sky\\" features drumming and cymbal-bashing *exactly* the same as the opening track on this Humble Pie album.  Coincidence?    Get ready for over 70 minutes of classic rock jamming at its very finest.  Rockin' the Fillmore is a must have for sure.

B000N4SADC|5.0|This is a mixed bag of a concept album. <br /> <br />First off, this kind of music should not be viewed of in terms of modern songs. This is a continuation of her concept of orchestra, what she introduced on Spiral. The music is more like an improvised concerto, with solos less having to do with playing riffs on top of chords, but more to do with improvising freely in the style of the mood and the group concept. <br /> <br />This is NOT jazz music, but more like orchestral fusion. If you could imagine a classical orchestra of master players playing and improvising in modern grooves, this would be it. <br /> <br />Even concepts such as time signatures mean nothing, because with Hiromi's music, it could change at any point in time. This music is to be consumed as a whole: do not try to categorize this music into chunks with solos and  choruses. <br /> <br />The most conventional song she sets up is on Time Out, with an outrageous classic solo taken by Dave Fiuczynski in the Scofield style. <br /> <br />However, give it some time, and like Spiral, Hiromi's genius will continue destroy categories and conventions. You will catch traces of all kinds types of music here: Bach, Jimi Hendrix, New Age stuff, smooth jazz, as well as Ornette Coleman, and even Miles Davis Bitches' Brew. <br /> <br />The best way to enjoy this is to quit thinking and just listen, and then you will understand what is going on here: Hiromi has become THE biggest force in instrumental music. <br /> <br />LIKE ALL OF HER MUSIC, NOTHING COMPARES TO THE LIVE PERFORMANCES OF THESE PIECES.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wilco is basically the reigning king of countryish alt-rock -- even when it stumbled, it was still keeping a hand on the throne.<br /><br />And fortunately, after the disappointing \\"A Ghost is Born,\\" Wilco returns with a mellow, more optimistic sound in \\"Sky Blue Sky.\\" Frankly, Jeff Tweedy sounds more at peace with the world, and he wraps that peace in a back-to-basics country-rock blanket.<br /><br />\\"Maybe the sun will shine today/The clouds will blow away/Maybe I won't feel so afraid/I will try to understand either way,\\" Tweedy sings over a folky guitar, a swelling violin and a flickering piano. It sounds like a promise to a loved one, after his stint with addiction: \\"I will try to understand/Everything has its plan/Either way I'm going to stay right for you...\\"<br /><br />He follows it up with a gentle river of mellow, smooth alt-rockers laced with keyboard, stomping rockers, loosely-wound acoustic ballads, drawling electro-country, and combinations of all of the above. And they're all slow-burning, meditative and reflective, right up to the hopeful \\"What Light\\" and the delicate piano'n'strings of \\"On and On and On.\\"<br /><br />You could call this Jeff Tweedy's \\"recovery album\\" -- it's filled with new hope, old fears, repairing relationships with loved ones (\\"you're gonna need to be patient with me\\") and reflections on the world. There's something very personal about most of these songs.<br /><br />And the music has gone back to basics -- rippling acoustic guitar, piano melodies and ripples of retro keyboard, and some blasts of bass and violin. While Wilco doesn't forge any new territory, they do polish up what they have with some lovely harmonies and layers of delicate instrumentation.<br /><br />Tweedy's slightly rough voice is a pleasant one, registering yearning, sorrow and optimism through the album. The lyrics stumble at times, such as one cringingly awkward intro (\\"Impossible Germany/Unlikely Japan/Wherever you go/Wherever you land\\"), but fortunately are fairly solid for the rest of the album (\\"When the mysteries we believe in/Aren't dreamed enough to be true/Some side with the leaves...\\")<br /><br />\\"Sky Blue Sky\\" isn't quite Wilco at its best, but it is Wilco in a solid, musically adept place, with a note of optimism that hasn't quite been there before.e mysteries we believe in/Aren't dreamed enough to be true/Some side with the leaves...\\")    \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" isn't quite Wilco at its best, but it is Wilco in a solid, musically adept place, with a note of optimism that hasn't quite been there before.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park. <br /> <br />Picture, if you will, an insanely successful rock group with an innovative and incredibly catchy sound. Their first two albums utterly epitomize the phrases \\"hard rock\\" and \\"lyrical angst,\\" and they have to spend years touring just to expend all the collective fan-energy their music has collectively created. <br /> <br />Altogether, they go over four years without releasing any new material. Four years of sell-out, no-holds-barred concerts. Four years of the same tracks, over and over. Don't you think they might be ready for some more of that innovation that got them started? I know I'd be ready to try something different and fresh, instead of writing more of the same. <br /> <br />Indeed, all bands change over time, naturally evolving to avoid creative complacency, and Linkin Park was even so good as to warn their fanbase that change was coming. You'd think people would have seen it coming and braced for it. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, their newest album, \\"Minutes to Midnight,\\" is going to cause a whole lot of malcontent in the fanbase, and that can't be helped. Lead vocalists Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda are renowned for the blistering rap-rock that put them on the map, and it's natural that some people will be pissed that there's no rap-rock on this album. <br /> <br />Yes, none at all. <br /> <br />And then some will listen to it again, and again, and again. Some will slowly start to understand the reality that it was time for a change. If Linkin Park is known for innovation, then it's time they innovated again. Then, after a few weeks, they'll be saying to themselves, \\"This album is one awesome piece of work.\\" <br /> <br />When great artists go years without an album, it takes a long time to get used to the new songs when they finally arrive, and then it takes even longer to decide whether you like them more or less than the old stuff. No human being on the planet who's ever given Chester and Mike the time of day will be able to listen to this album the first time through and like it as much as they will the tenth time through. <br /> <br />Long story short: Linkin Park's reinvented themselves, and \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is a strong message to fans that they're back, and that they've done plenty of thought outside the box they created for themselves with their first two albums. They've enjoyed the process more than ever before, and they want us to enjoy the music. <br /> <br />So let's give it a chance, shall we? <br /> <br />Tracks: <br />1. Wake - No Rating <br />The band calls attention to the double-meaning of this track's title in the booklet accompanying the album. It's appropriate that it starts with a sound not unlike a small fire mixed with an old crackling record. Gentle bells against the growing hum of an electric guitar put you in a contemplative mood, and then the song opens up into what is almost a classic LP guitar riff lasting only a few seconds before the track fades. This is a wake for what the band is putting behind them, and also an awakening of a new evolutionary stage for their music. <br /> <br />2. Given Up - 7 / 10 <br />And then comes the key-jingling, rapid-clapping opening of the first new song. Quiet electric strumming gives way into angsty, upbeat chords leading into a low-key, growling verse from Chester. In a few moments, he sings the title of the song and kicks it up a notch in an instant. You're already rocking in whatever seat you're sitting in by this point, and then all of a sudden, you hear Chester actually swear. Yes, Linkin Park's accepted the fact that some of their stuff's actually pretty moody, and now they have some language to go along with it. For this song, it fits. <br /> <br />Especially when the bridge hits and you hear him scream \\"Put me out of my f***ing mi-se-RRRRRRRR-\\" Cue seventeen-second, blood-curdling, bone-chilling scream. You will bow before Chester Benington before this song is over. <br /> <br />All in all, the song is good. It's not great all around, but it has elements (such as the scream and the new style of opening) of greatness that make it a great introduction to the new album. <br /> <br />3. Leave Out All The Rest - 7 / 10 <br />Now it's time to introduce another aspect of the new Linkin Park: Songs that will actually make you smile, songs with a softer side, and with a softer sound to accompany them. This track is not among the album's best, but it has a great deal of lyrical meaning to it, and it's actually kind of a pretty song. As such, it's a deeper song than we're used to hearing from LP, and so it deserves credit for that. <br /> <br />4. Bleed It Out - 9 / 10 <br />The single catchiest song they've ever written. <br /> <br />Seriously. If you're not grinning ear to ear and clapping and/or tapping your foot before the first chorus is over, you need to get your brain checked, and possibly your arm and leg muscles too. This is Mike's first song on the album, though Chester sings the chorus. The band writes that it was important to them that they enjoy the process of writing the album, and it shows in this song. Just read the first words of the first verse. <br /> <br />Yea, here we go for the hundredth time <br />Handgrenade pins in every line <br />Throw 'em up and let somethin' shine <br />Goin' out of my f***in' mind <br /> <br />Enough said. Listen to it and enjoy. <br /> <br />5. Shadow of the Day - 8 / 10 <br />I want to give this song a higher score because I love it so much, but objectively, it's an eight. This is the second slow(ish) song for the album, and it's much better than the first. It's better because it doesn't try as hard; it's a simple song, and it knows it. After a few verses, the song slowly starts building and focuses on a own moving, refreshing chorus. <br /> <br />The song itself is about going your separate ways with a loved one, and while the words are sad, the notes themselves slowly build up to create the energy and happiness that one associates withmoving on in life. Furthermore, the buildup is handled wonderfully in that just when you've started to feel that energy, you hear the instrumental bridge and start to think the song's almost over. <br /> <br />After all, most songs only repeat the chorus one more time after the bridge, so you listen to what you think is the last chorus, and then they play the bridge again, only with more power. Then Chester comes in with the true last chorus, and it's just great. One of the best on the album. <br /> <br />6. What I've Done - 10 / 10 <br />We all know this song's been out for a while, and we all know it's great, but we had no idea how awesome it would be in the context of the album around it. For all intents and purposes, this is a classic Linkin Park song (minus Shinoda and Benington combining their talents... Shinoda's actually on the instruments here). However, it's more tuned down and less synthesized than their older stuff. The piano and drum tracks in the background are more distinct during the verses, and the electric riffs during the chorus seem somehow purer and simpler than, say... \\"Somewhere I Belong.\\" <br /> <br />I also like that Chester spends this song simply singing, without actually yelling at any point. He does have a decent voice with a tremendous range, and it's nice to hear him using it in the truest sense. <br /> <br />Oh, and it helps that the song's pretty positive (the final verse is about new beginnings) as opposed to the wallowing-in-self-pity themes that dominated most of their old songs. <br /> <br />7. Hands Held High - 8 / 10 <br />This is a great track. Shinoda owns this song, in the deepest, most personal sense. His verses will move you because he has a message to send and he sends it with inspiration and power. It's a beautiful song, and by far the most powerful stuff Shinoda's ever written. However, I've got to be honest, because there's a little problem. <br /> <br />That \\"message\\" is political. <br /> <br />Again, I like this song. It's on a mix I've already made with the new songs. But I'd have given the song a nine without political beliefs clouding music. I've said it before in other reviews and I'll say it again here: Music should be an escape from reality, something to surround yourself with so you can breathe easier, even if just for a few moments. Bringing politics into the equation is not a way to further that ideal. I just wish musical artists could write songs without treating the mic as a political activist's soapbox. <br /> <br />Moving on! <br /> <br />8. No More Sorrow - 6 / 10 <br />See above. Now it's Chester's turn to be political. <br /> <br />The opening to the song is amazing, filled with a dark upwelling of energy until it bursts into a deep, heavy set of chords and more low-key singing from Chester a la \\"Given Up.\\" <br /> <br />When I realize the similarities between this song and Chester's first on the album, I can't help but give it a low score not only for the political theme (just my personal opinion, again), but because it is so similar, and because the other is better. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the opening is amazing, but the song doesn't follow through. I had higher hopes for this track last month on account of the title... it's a shame. <br /> <br />9. Valentine's Day - 7 / 10 <br />A sad song, but in a more interpersonal sense than Linkin Park's written in the past. A lot of their songs focused on relationship issues or personal insecurities, but this one is written around dealing with the loss of a loved one instead. Chester opens the song with his voice sounding coarse (perhaps intentional after his screams in \\"No More Sorrow\\"), and the song slowly gives way to a non-stop, heavy second half that's enjoyable when you just need something to which you can rock out for a bit. <br /> <br />10. In Between - 6 / 10 <br />The worst so far, but not the worst of the album. Shinoda actually sings this one (not raps, sings!), so that's pretty neat, but the openingof the song just isn't much of a hook at all. The song delivers lyrically, but you're never quite sure what exactly Mike's trying to say. The song's an apology, but it's unclear what he feels he has to apologize for. <br /> <br />It's just odd, really. I don't quite know what to make of the track, and that's not good in any event. <br /> <br />11. In Pieces - 7 / 10 <br />I think this one is still growing on me, because I like slow build-up tracks, and this is one. It's also got a great little solo that starts off simple and blows up into a rockfest. Lyrically, the song's great (once again), and the catchy vocal/instrumental harmony at a few points later in the song is hard to ignore. All in all, however, the song doesn't inspire me to write more than this many lines about it. <br /> <br />12. The Little Things Give You Away - 5 / 10 <br />It hurts me to give an LP song a five, but the album just doesn't end as strongly as it began. You can tell that the guys were going for an inspirational chorus with this particular track, and it just doesn't quite come together. The vocals don't seem to flow with the instrumentals, and it feels disjointed and even forced at points. It's not a song that makes you want to keep listening to it, and songs really are supposed to do that, right? <br /> <br />---Overall album score: 7.2 / 10 <br /> <br />I said all that stuff at the beginning for a reason: We've all got to go into this with an open mind, ready to accept change. Most albums have their high and low points, and you can usually tell a good artist when you can walk away from a listening session with at least three tracks that stuck out. Over half of this album stands out to me after several listens, and I think that's awesome. <br /> <br />Linkin Park's trying to take themselves in a new, less commercialized direction, and I know they're going to lose some fans, but you know what? I like the new sound, and I think plenty of other folks will too. They might even attract a few new listeners (gasp) with their new approach. <br /> <br />---Verdict: <br />\\"Minutes to Midnight\\" proves that Linkin Park has what it takes to emerge from a vicious cycle of making too much of the same. They're on the right track to a glorious new sound, and while they're not completely there yet, this is an awesome first step for the journey. May the next be even more revolutionary.
B000N3SRRC|2.0|I love Clutch, they're amazing, but this album is poor at best.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I will state the obvious right off the bat.  Yes, it's a different Linkin Park.  Yes, there sound is much softer.  But to say that it's a bad album because they dare to try something different is completely off.  Every great band that has stood the test of time at one point or another has to venture into what they feel is artistic freedom of expression.  The Beatles did it with their Revolver album, U2 did it with Achtung Baby.  This album is the album that may just catapult LP into a new, more mature band, whose music will stand the test of time due to their growth as artist, not nu metal, rapcore rockers.<br /><br />  The highlights in this album include: Leave Out All The Rest, Shadow Of The Day (Which by the way, sounds all too much like With or Without You, by U2, which is a good thing!), What I've Done, and The Little Things Give You Away.  Special mention needs to be given to the intro track, Wake.  This track alone would be a great way to start off any concert!  Talk about epic!<br /><br />  Many LP fans will protest the new album.  I can almost hear them say,\\"How dare they try to fix what NOT BROKEN!  Werent they thinking about US when writing the music?  Did'nt they know that the new sound would'nt fly with us?\\".  To a certain extent, they kinda have a good reason to protest.  LP would not be where their at if it werent for their loyal fan base.  On the other hand, a band cannot be restricted because of their fan base.  A real band needs to risk what they currently have in order to find and achive what they believe their potential is.  I say, great job.  This is an album that will stay in my shelf for years to come.
1582701709|5.0|The contents of this book encourages life changing strategies.  It had inspired me to take a look at the world around me and how I fit into that world. How both positive and negative force impacted me and what can I do to change them.  Great inspiration book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|BBC America's new series Robin Hood turned me on to the wonderfulness that is Richard Armitage (Sir Guy) so when I stumbled across North and South and heard it repeatedly compared to my favorite movie of all time \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Colin Firth I had to have it. While this movie is not as romanticly centered as P&P it still has it's own charm that is slowly stealing my heart. The world that is created is fantastic and the slow building tension between the two main characters is phenominal. A MUST have for any Historical Romance fan!
B000009DUY|5.0|The playing is excellent, especially the trumpet playing by Tim Morrison and Thomas Rolfs.  Definitely worth having in anyone's collection.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|All I can really say is that im highly upset! I BEEN A LINKIN PARK FAN SINCE HYBRID THEORY AND I HAVE WAITED 4 YEARS FOR THIS. THIS CD IS PURE B.S AND GARBAGE. THE ONLY SONGS THATS REALLY GOOD ON THIS IS WHAT IVE DONE TRACK 6, LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST TRACK 3, AND SHADOW OF THE DAY TRACK 5. IN ALL RESPECT FOR LINKIN PARK I KNOW THEY PROBABLY TRIED TO INVENT SOME NEW SOUND IN THIS L.P WITH RICK RUBIN BEING THE PRODUCER OF THIS ALBUM. BUT SOMEONE F'D UP THIS ALBUM AND RICK RUBIN BIG PART OF THE BLAIM IDK HOW OUTTA THE 6 BAND MEMBERS SOMEONE CANT SAY NOOOOO IM NOT FEELING THIS ALBUM AND WE NEED TO DO US AND NOBODY ELSE. I HOPE AFTER LINKIN PARK HERE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR FANS COMPLAIN HOW THEY DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE ALBUM. THEY WILL QUICKLY GO BACK IN THE STUDIO THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR AND MAKE SOME REAL L.P HITS THAT HAVE THERE OWN DISTINCT SOUND. I WAS EXPECTIN ANOTHER METEORA WITH A NEW TWIST SOMETHING I CAN BANG IN THE CAR AND ENJOY BUT THIS ALBUM IS SO QUIET AND BORING IN ALL HONESTY U CAN FALL ASLEEP. ANYONE THAT BUY IT WILL BE SUPPRISED BUT THATS MY OPINION. BUY THE ALBUM FOR YOURSELF AND U DECIDE. ALL IN ALL L.P FANS KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO HERE AND THIS IS NOT THE L.P I GREW 2 LOVE. AND THE NEW ADDED SWEARIN IS NOT NECESSARY AT ALL NONE OF THERE OTHER ALBUMS HAD PARENTAL ADVISORY ON IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SWEARING AND IT WAS BETTER! AND THIS HAVE SWEARING AND WHAT CAN I SAY :-(
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park's third major effort, 2007's Minutes To Midnight is exceptional to say the least. No, it's not Hybrid Theory and no it's not Meteora...Both previous albums were classic in their own way, especially the latter of the two, so most people were expecting Meteora II with the third record. However, Linkin Park does the exact opposite. They hired legendary producer Rick Rubin to handle the album and develop a new era of the band. I've had the album since last Wed and my opinion on it has been the same since I've had it: Amazing. Despite hoping for something like Meteora, Linkin Park delivered a new sound that is just as or even better than their previous. It would have been ridiculous for the band to stay in the era (Rap-rock nu metal) that was defined by Limp Bizkit and bands like that. The band has grown and I actually am surprised by saying, this might possibly be their best album to date. Meteora is great too, but LP must be commended for taking chances with this new record. Minutes To Midnight means rebirth for the band and they have been reborn beautifully...There are only two tracks on the album which really don't live up to the rest of the album. the rest is a masterpiece...
B000NVIGC0|4.0|When I first heard the buzz about this album I was worried. I'm a big fan of Wilco and the other bands that Jeff is part of. I was concerned for nothing. This album is good. You can hear the progression of sound. It does harken back to earlier albums, but with the addition of the techniques used/learned on their last 2 albums.   It seems that people love to focus on the problems with things, such as the issues that caused Wilco to re-structure themselves, and not on the music being created. I focused on the music. I enjoyed it, and if you like Wilco you will too.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Because of the excesses of advertising, in a tabloid world, our language has been trivialized and minimized to the lowest common denominator.  This leaves little to describe something genuinely so amazing, so filled with wonder as these films are.  Most of us will never see the wonders filmed here, the places the cameras have been, but we can vicariously experience them in awe and appreciation of the planet we're so busily destroying.  It's hard to believe anyone could watch this series and not care about our magnificent gift of the earth, and want to take better care of it.
0374105235|5.0|I thought that this book clearly shows the horrors of what children soldiers and the people living in Sierra Leone are having to deal with during and after the war. It is a very well writen book and I think that it is a good book for people to read because it talks about issues that we need to be thinking about and trying to fix.
0790729644|5.0|Unforgiven is definitely my favorite western of all time. Clint directs and stars in this film. This is a must watch for any western film fan.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I admit that upon first listen, I was a bit shocked and disappointed. Because I'm a big fan of LP and especially Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor, I so looked forward to hearing their kickass signature sound, only louder and better. Guess what, LP changed gear on us. I'm sure some fans are completely thrown off by this. But I'm glad I've given this album more listen and really started enjoying its more carefully crafted songs. I think in this album, LP is more thoughtful, more provactive, more dimensional. Chester's usual strong, angry voice still good as ever, and now he adds more color to his sound. I do wish it could have more Shinoda.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think this is a solid album, differend, yes, but a worthy one.
B000003TA4|5.0|If you like rock and roll this is a must have. <br />A classic album for all. <br />A start of a new trend and a key impact on the next generation.
0060920084|5.0|It would be a real stretch to say that Bill Bryson thoroughly researches everything he writes about, goes out of his way to learn about and see and document only the most interesting aspects of places, and presents his portraits of places fairly and with an effort to see every side of both places and issues.<br />A real stretch.<br />But, it wouldn't be a stretch at all to say that Bill Bryson is undeniably loaded with wit and humor.  This book is, I believe, Bill Bryson's very funniest.  I laughed so hard at his descriptions of eating in small town diners that I woke my wife up who was sleeping next to me, several times.  I tried to read passages from it to my brother over the phone, but couldn't get certain words out because I was silenced by laughing, by the sort of full-body laughing usually only high schoolers drinking milk get to enjoy.<br />This book is not an objective or a thorough or a totally accurate picture of America; its passages about the West, places I'm especially familiar with, almost appalled me at the total lack of effort Bryson made to go out of his way to see anything other than major attractions like the Grand Canyon.  Even there, he just stood on the edge and looked over.  However, what this book is, is funny.  Very funny.  Dangerously funny, especially if you ever find yourself hiding in an Anne Frank-style bunker, living secretly in fear of the government, where laughing very loudly could end your life.<br />I highly recommend this book.  Writers about American subjects will find quotable quotes on almost every region, and lovers of good comedy will find a very enjoyable read.<br />Plus, and I couldn't believe this, it's really well-indexed.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This film made my trip to england even more surreal and beautiful. The peak district and the rolling english countryside is shown at its best int he movie. It was inspiring, and my trip was very emotional. The film itself is great! It's one of the few movies I can watch repeatedly! And i have a short attention span! I'm happy there was a bit more affection shown in this adaptation. I  found Macfayden and Knightley to have extraordinary chemistry. 5 stars!!!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The light show stimulates your eyes while the sounds of Pink Floyd stimulates your ears. It's a sensory work of genius! It also makes a great gift!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums of 2007,being that i am a hardcore Linkin Park fan i at first had some reservations about their \\"new\\" sound when i first heard out about them experimenting with it.And this album totally does not dissapoint at all,it still retains classic Linkin Park sound but also adds in a lot of musical maturity and growth to the greatest band around. Ever since the Hybrid Theory commercial was on TV promoting it before they were publicly know i jumped at getting that cd then and with Hybrid Theory they made the jump to being in my opinion name brand to begin with.Following the 10x Platinum sales we move up to 2003 with the March release of Meteora - another fantastic album basically a HT Part 2 but still added new innovative sounds and continued maturity -both albums from front to back are masterpieces.Then the dreaded wait........2 years go by, no album-ok i guess they are just taking much needed time off - 3 years - wondering whats up with them-4 years - getting hyped about some speculation of a new cd,then finding out that a new cd is in fact being released - i totally was ready.Here came today May.15th,2007 and Minutes To Midnight is released and to be perfectly honest not everyone will like it at first but before you give up on it please give it a couple tries to get the full effect of it and trust me you'll love it - changed sound and classic LP = lasting presence for sure - it was only a matter of time before they changed up a bit, beings the fact that nu metal basically left. And if you ever noticed usually every band by the 3rd cd changes their sound or \\"formula\\". EX. Audioslave - Revelations, John Mayer - Continuum, i mean it aint 3 but Godsmack at least held out until 4 to change,but as i stated change with bands is inevitable,but with Linkin Park it is a good one.
B000OCXF0Q|3.0|This new CD is really weard. I only enjoyed 6 out of 12 tracks. And the B-Sides (Alone n the other can't recall @ the moment) r better than the A-Sides. The DVD is very good, coz it shows what the CD really is: something produced in a hurry while she was drunk. She repeats herself in many tracks instead of creating good lyrics she only talks about a Paris Hilton life and shows her pathetic way of living (spraying pepper in her \\"friend's\\" eyes, etc). Of course we cannot judge her because of one track, but when we have got a whole album saying things such as: \\"I couldn't give a damn what you say to me\\", \\"Always get me what I want\\", etc. we know that it is something in her mind. But not everything is lost. We still have got some gr8 tracks such s the ones she show on the DVD (1,2,3,4,9,11,12 in my opinion). For an Avril's trully fan it doesn't matter: we're just here to support her.
B000O174CM|5.0|Oh my GOD!  I went to the movies 3 times, now i own this dvd and i just can't get enough of it.  WOW!  This two-disc showstopper is really great.  The disc two is awesome.  What i loved the most about it was the fact that they give a closer look of JENNIFER HUDSON when performing AND I AM TELLING YOU I'M NOT GOING and you can actually see her tears.  Man, i cried like a baby again!!  This is a no brainer, get it now, it's really worth it. <br />Just for the record, in case you don't know, this movie won the Golden Globe for Best Picture and JENNIFER HUDSON won the OSCAR for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|If you like Linkin Park, then don't buy this CD. What the heck happened to them?
B00003CXE6|5.0|Amazingly, interestingly, and surprisingly, the movie Gladiator received 5 Academy Awards because of its rich quality and Russell Crowe's perfect, pleasing, polished, prized performance. The movie Gladiator is a Ridley Scott film which is a Dreamworks and Universal production, and stars Russell Crowe as Maximus:  the general who became a slave, who became a gladiator.  Although Gladiator is rated R for intense, graphic combat, it is an excellent movie lasting a highly refreshing two hours and thirty-five minutes, and is a movie that most teenagers are permitted to watch along with their parents.  <br />    <br /> The movie Gladiator is about the Roman army's general by the name of Maximus who becomes a slave, and then is made a gladiator.  When Rome's Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, begins to grow old and weak, he decides to crown Maximus as Emperor before he dies, because he had realized that his only son, Commodus, was unfit to become the next Emperor of Rome.  Unfortunatly, Commodus was informed of his father's astute decision.  Commodus brutally murdered his father.  He became Rome's Emperor.  Maximus fled for his life.  Tragically, Commodus tried to have Maximus secretly slaughtered by his men in the wilderness.  Escaping the Emperor and his men's wrath, Maximus hurries to his home to try and save his family before they can be killed.  Across the rural terrain, Maximus rides his horse, treads the path on foot, and rests on the rocky ground until he reaches the outskirts of Rome. <br /> <br /> Maximus faced his worst nightmare.  Arriving at his home out in the wilderness, Maximus finds that he came too late, since the Emperor's men showed up before he did and they killed his wife and son, who were not warned of their fate.  Hopelessly, Maximus trudged away from his beloved home and the life he used to have because there was nothing left for him there.  While Maximus buried his beloved family near his homestead, he was slowly lossing his strength and losing the will to live.  Along the edge of the road, he plodded on until he collapsed on the ground, unconscious.  He laid there, motionless.  Maximus was soon spotted by an ignominous slave caravan, was captured by the slave caravan, and was displayed for sale as a slave when he awoke.  After a man came along seeking to purchase some slaves to become gladiators, Maximus was immediately and wisely chosen as one of the men.  Maximus' life becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Since Maximus had plenty of experience in battle, because he was an army general, he fought surprisingly well in the arena.  Defeating every opponent in the arena as easily as if he were swatting a fly, Maximus was prolific as a gladiator, and so he gained a wide reputation.  Because of Maximus' great reputation, Commodus, (who is) now Emperor of Rome, not knowing that the great well-known gladiator is Maximus, decides one day to watch him fight.  Angrily, Emperor Commodus realizes that Maximus had evaded the wrath of his men, that Maximus had survived all these years, and that Maximus was standing in front of him at that moment as the idolized and famous warrior himself.  Commodus plots an evil scheme.  Maximus is challenged to fight the Emperor for his freedom, and when they fight, the outcome is utterly shocking. <br />After reviewing the movie Gladiator, Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post stated, \\"Russell Crowe is simply magnificent!\\"  Personally, I love the movie!  Viewing, reviewing, and critiquing Gladiator, Andrew Johnston, who works for US Weekly, rates the movie as \\"****\\" because he, too, thinks that Gladiator is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I heard so much raving about this new musical that I wanted to see it for myself.  Unfortunately, the show tickets were completely sold out the first few hours they were released when the show was coming to town for a few weeks.  That speaks volume about how great the show must be.  So I bought the CD, listened, and instantly loved it.  Eventually, I saw the live show too.  I have so much to write about this show, but I'll try to limit myself to give a review only about the CD.    The CD features a good selection of songs from the play without giving away any surprises from the stage production (and there are many surprises!).  It leaves you wanting to see the live performance to see what you miss in the whole story.    All the singers are excellent.  They do a very great job conveying the personalities, emotions, and energy of the characters.  \\"Defying Gravity\\" is one of my favorites as it very well conveys Elphaba's sense of freedom and independence to do what she believes in.  \\"No Good Deed\\" is another energetic and emotional song.  \\"For Good\\" is a very meaningful, emotional, and touching song about friendship and parting.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This is avery good and typical job of all Tom Selick's movies. He is one of the best. Could have done without the sex scenes. Would have made it an even better movie.

0743454537|4.0|This was my first book by Ms. Picoult and I know now that it won't be my last.  This story gripped me from the first few pages on and I just didn't want to put it down.  I actually loved the multiple narrations and it wasn't as jarring as similar books I've read with multiple storytellers.<br /><br />On the downside I tried (as a mother) to see Sara's point of view and sympathize with her, but she was so cold and distant and unlikeable that I really couldn't.  It seemed as though Anna was just a spare part that Sara had to keep close to use as needed and I found her to be somewhat unrealistic.  Also, while I didn't think the ending was horrible, it was extrememly jarring and hurried and it was so disappointing to have our only view of the secondary characters reactions to be through a 3 page narrative at the end.<br /><br />All in all this was a great read and it's one of those books you'll want to give to your significant other and friends just so you can discuss it.  You'll be thinking about it long after you read the final line.
B000000H57|5.0|I love this album as a whole and songs individually. I can listen to it over and over, year after year and continue to love it after many years. Definately one of their finest albums.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I'm just a casual fan of Linkin Park, I have most of their most \\"popular\\" songs on my collections but I don't own any of their CDs for a reason. Ever since I found out Rick Rubin was producing this album, I was a bit curious to hear the \\"new\\" LP and also because they said that this new album had no rap in it...boy I was wrong!. After listening to it a couple of minutes I deleted from my hard drive and wished that I could get my 10 minutes back of precious time wasted listening to this!<br /><br />Dont get me wrong. Rick Rubin did a great job like always but the music just doesn't work for me. Good thing Megadeth new album came out the same day so I picked that baby up!!!!!
B0009VBTA0|5.0|This one flows.  It is intricate and the transitions from cut to cut are seamless.  Really enjoyable and doesn't get old or tired. Down To the Moon and White Winds are good but this is a 5 star to their 4's.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|As I tell anybody that wishes to view Serenity: you must watch firefly first. Serenity wastes no time in getting to the story and as such there is no character development and new viewers tend to get lost and frustrated without the background. Figure out who everyone is and their relationships first and you won't be disappointed. Besides, Firefly is probably the best space action-comedy available and you won't be wasting your time.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Sounds like the LP got back to basics.  This album is a mix of Hybrid theory and MEteora.  It combines the emotion found in Hybrid theory with the Elcetronic Punk sound found in Meteora.<br /><br />The CD has at least 9 hit singles if not 11.  I must say that it sounds like the Band had a good time making this.  I have been listening to it non stop and cant wait to see them when they tour.

B00006YXOX|5.0|I was happy to acquire the Bruckner/Jochum cycle many years after having owned Bruckner's 7th & 8th on a 3-cassette(!) DG set during my college days.  This was where I first heard these two symphonies and grew to love them.  So there is some nostalgia here for me.  Hearing these once again felt a little like a home-coming.  Thanks to Amazon, I was able to acquire this set on an amazing deal.<br /><br />I am not going to debate the other reviewers' opinions on the merits or shortcomings of this set versus others.  I have the Solti/CSO set, the Inbal set with the original versions of several symphonies, as well as some of Barenboim's, Boulez's, Chailly's, and Karajan's, not to mention Klemperer's recording of the 6th, which continues to be re-issued.  While some of the pure digital recordings may have sonics that surpass this set, the performances and the warmth of that late 50's/early 60's sound will surely prove enjoyable.  (I am writing this not having heard all nine symphonies yet.)<br /><br />The compact packaging of envelope-clad 9 CDs in a simple cardboard box (with a booklet) avoids the risk of hearing your CDs bouncing and scraping in the jewel box set upon shipment, so there is less anxiety about receiving a scratched CD and wondering whether it will play.<br /><br />One of the features of this set that I appreciated was the booklet.  It features Jochum's own essay on performing the symphonies, which I found insightful.  Too seldom do the conductors these days take the time to document their intent and approach for us listeners.  This essay reinforced for me that this really was a body of work, not just a collection of nine recorded symphonies.  There is another essay, examining the symphonies from a musical historical perspective.<br /><br />For listeners looking to take the plunge on a Bruckner set, but without a lot of cash, this set is a good value.  For serious Bruckner fans, this is the first full cycle recorded, and has never been out of the DG catalog; that certainly says something about it.  Bruckner was not so much in vogue in the late 50's/early 60's, or so I have read, so these recordings may have had a hand in the revival that has put more Bruckner performances in concert halls today.G catalog; that certainly says something about it.

This is a strict business book with internal memos and charts at the end so it can lend itself to being a bit boring in some parts.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Olive is a young girl who persistantly attempts to fufill her dream of becoming a pageant winner in the worldwide \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" contest. She is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this dream and strieves to gain support from her family who eventually gives in and decides to take a road trip to where the pagent takes place. Along the way several obsticales prevent them from arriving at the pagent on time. For instance, the family is having debt problems, the mute brother realizes tht he is colorblind and therefore is incapable of being a pilot, the grandpa dies, the family car breaks down. The length that Olive's family is willing to go in order to assist her in fufilling her dream is very heartwarming. If you love movies that are unpredictable, hilarious, yet have true important meaning and values behind them, then Little Miss Sunshine is the movie for you! <br />-Alyssa
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Simply said, Thank You for Smoking is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The script is brilliant and all the actors are well cast and do a fabulous job.  As an extra plus the exploration of spin and its effects is a real education.  Don't miss this one!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I dont like to use the term \\"return to the roots\\" how many roots they have??? megadeth were never one dimensional band since begining, every megadeth albums has various type of songs with different tempo.<br /><br />This album need more then 10 listens for me to like it, its not as catchy as the world needs a hero & the system has failed. apart from a tout le monde remake all songs on the album are perfect. i dont say the new version is bad but its still an old song with new sounding, the extended solo by glen is my fav part of this tune. There's slow tempo ,mid tempo & thrash part which has been megadeth trademark since begining and one thing that will always there, it is thrash yet its melodic!<br /><br />the opening is progressive type of song, no chorus no verse, only riff 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and pure thrash outro! perhaps heaviest closing track megadeth ever done! finally i have to say the solo on this album are powerfull! everyonce in a while you'll hear a solo or at least a fill background solo, it just never end. there's more then 60 solos on this album.<br /><br />if you're disapointed then you're probably typical \\"I want RIP 2\\" type of fans, i'm not for sure. again i have to say, 3 listens wont get you into this album, you need at least 10.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am a big fan of the Timothy Dalton BBC version of Jane Eyre because it is so faithful to the book.  The Masterpiece Theatre version won me over on the first viewing.  While it is not as faithful to the book as the BBC 1982 version, it is still beautifully done.  Toby Stephens did a magnificent job as Rochester, despite the fact that he is really a handsome red-headed man.  Ruth Wilson embodied Jane Eyre very well. The performances made up for the liberties taken with the story.  A very well done updated version to this classic timeless novel.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I've listened to LP off and on for the last seven years, but it was only recently that I began to really like the band. I absolutely love every song on Hybrid Theory and Meteora, so I was very excited for the release of Minutes to Midnight. \\"What I've Done\\" is a fantastic song. I had high hopes for the album after hearing it on the radio and seeing the video on television. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, those hopes were unfounded. Having listened to the CD after purchasing it yesterday, I find myself very disappointed. The songs are far too slow. Linkin Park is supposed to be FAST. And where's Mike's rapping along with Chester's vocals? Instead of pairing them up, the band has split them into separate songs. And the song with the \\"amen\\" is terrible. <br /> <br />A huge let down. 3 out of 5 stars.

B000JJRIN4|5.0|So I've always loved Gwen, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape are my favorite albums. I've written a review on this CD before, but I just wanted to say, that after i saw her on The Sweet Escape Tour in Tampa on May 8th, i love her even more, my friend, who used to hate it when i listened to her, and wanted to throw away my Gwen CDs, now loves her and listens to her all the time, we went to the concert together, and even her boyfreind, who isnt a Gwen fan, liked her music too. I saw her on her first tour Harajuku Lovers, and it was amazing as well, but on this one, she really knows how to work up a crowd, she is one of the most amazing artists out there, and she's someone i look up to.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|As creator Kripke said, this show basically revolves around the stereotypical Han Solo-and-Luke Skywalker duo running around America with chainsaws in the trunk. There's a reason why the original Star Wars series was so popular, and that reason was because this stereotypical duo really /works/. <br /> <br />Supernatural is fun, witty, and just a great kick-back-on-the-couch-with-a-bowl-of-popcorn type of show. You need to think, yes, but you don't need to think so hard that it feels like you're back in school and chained to the desk. There is also angst, of course, and like any good television show, the Winchester boys end up getting under your skin and actually making you care. :) <br /> <br />This DVD is the perfect way to enjoy the series brand-new, or to reminisce and watch all your favourite episodes. There are a lot of great special features, and the gag reel is a definite must-see.  <br /> <br />That said, purchase this DVD! It's guaranteed to give you a good time. ;)
B00062RCBW|1.0|My wife is a big fan of Patrick Stewart and of ST:TNG.  I got the set for her birthday.  When we watched the first disk, it froze near the end of the pilot episode.  Amazon said to return all 50 odd disks, not just the defective one.  I did so and received a replacement.  When we attempted to watch the end of the pilot episode, we got a little farther before the disk froze again.  We watch about 10 DVDs a week and have had no other problems with our DVD player.  It makes me wonder about the quality control on the copying of this set.  I returned the entire set and requested a refund.  It has now been 6 weeks and still no refund.  When I requested the replacement disk, I was advised that the warranty lasts only 30 days.  That is not enough time to verify that 50 disks (approximately 150 hours of video) are good.

0312321376|4.0|This is an excellent, if rather dry, summing up of a body of evidence regarding reincarnation... or at least the evidence compiled by researchers associated with the University of Virginia. If it isn't as purely readable as Michael Newton or Carol Bowman (some of whose cases are in the book), it doesn't set out to be. The book's arrangement by scientific argument means that the cases are presented less as stories than as factual evidence, where some part of the information might be in Chapter 1 and another part several chapters later. On the other hand, viewed as information and not as narrative, it's hard to fault the book. Dr. Tucker calmly addresses and rebuts the arguments against reincarnation (at times, the counter-theories of those determined to accept any theory before reincarnation seem the more farfetched). If anything, Tucker - like Dr. Stevenson - is very conservative in his pronouncements. He dismisses hypnosis as evidence, and it would be interesting to read a discussion between him and past-life regression practitioners. There is little here about \\"between lives\\" or any attempt to map universal spiritual journey. The emphasis is on facts, to which the reader will add his or her own biases.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|To quote my friend \\"G\\", \\"This is WEAK SAUCE\\". This is their worst album, it just has nothing. Ok, yes there is two maybe three songs that are good, but the rest of the album is \\"WEAK SAUCE\\". I mean the other two albums had a great jams by Mr. Hahn, and this album needs it! I do like \\"Bleed It Out\\", \\"What I've Done\\", and \\"In Pieces\\" they are best tracks on a Weak album. I don't understand what happened, on \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" their is not a bad track on those albums, both albums rock from start to finish. This album puts you to sleep with the opening track. <br />This album is \\"WEAK SAUCE\\"
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Snakes & Arrows is a far superior album to Vapor Trails. I like Vapor Trails, but it has too dense a sound and as many have said, the individual instruments are lost and indistinct. S&A is dense, but at the same time the individual instruments are heard again. I LIKE this album! The best track is the Main Monkey Business- an instrumental that to me sounds like Rush of the 80's. I also like Far Cry, Armor and Sword, The Larger Bowl (a different song for Rush, but very well executed!), Hope, Malignant Narcissism, and the closer- We Hold On- is a great way to finish the album! I have tickets to see them in concert in July and can't wait to hear the aboe mentioned songs live. I'm not impressed with Bravest Face, the one track that I don't really like. Not that it's a bad song- it just doesn't do much for me. Oer all a very worthy album from Rush. Now if they would just redo Vapor Trails- if only for Earthshine and Ghostrider!
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Dave Mustaine has dusted off his guitar for this.. some blistering solos are on this cd. Lyrically it is broad. Political, personal ect.. This cd is better than 'System' which was better than 'Hero', which was better than 'Writings' ect... Now they (mustaine i should say) have come full circle with a great cd that delivers on all levels.<br />The only issue is the 'LeMonde' cover.. Its pretty horrid.. the original is much better.. Hate the fact that he is trying to spin some airplay by dueting. And the original SOUNDS much better. This is very cheesy. Sad for such a classic song. 'Washington is Next' is pretty bad as well. Points deducted...<br />If you liked older Megadeth. youll like this. Especially if you liked Rust In Peace.<br />If your affraid of Mustaine being a christian now and lightening up, think again.<br />Finally he has lived up to the promise of a great cd. Thanks Dave. Now you can actually say your band has surpassed Metallica. Better late than never. With good handling by RR records, this may sell better than Metallica's newer stuff as well.
0811828697|5.0|Although this is another starwars art book, it is a great book in and of itself. The artwork is amazing as well as well thought out and researched.  I have shared the book with many including children who are fascinated and inspired by the animals and environments within.  This book is a great buy for artists looking for inspirational work.
B0000086D2|5.0|A very enjoyable album.  The music is powerful, exciting and fun.  It was a favorite when I watched the film and it has remained one for me.
B000O178BY|3.0|The title sez it all.  A well constructed album.  Very hard to read the lyrics (weird txt against black background), but it's fairly easy to understand the message of this conceptual album.   <br /> <br />Track 2 and 3 (survilalism) are hard hitting while most of the other tracks are not as heavy as his usual work.   <br /> <br />If you want a heavy metal album then buy with teeth, otherwise for something different have a listen to year zero.   <br /> <br />Lots of underlying sounds and tweaks so the net samples won't give a very clear indication of the sound. <br /> <br />Keep up the good work Trent.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I was needlessly \\"hyped\\" over the Final Fantasy VII movie. I was a fan of the first game, and a movie version seemed to be a dream come true. However, there was little new in the movie, and even so it seemed fan service. Only a dedicated fan would appreciate it. Other passerby would only stop, curious, just to see the graphics. However, there is little else to recommend it.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|Minutes to Midnight continues 2 themes that have been with Linkin Park from the beginning: rap/rock hard crunching songs and albums that are very short in length.<br /><br />When an album is as short in length as Linkin Park albums are (this one is 43:29 thanks mainly to the final song on the cd which is over 6 minutes in length) you have to have quality in a majority of the songs or the album will fail to meet fan's expectations.  I'm afraid they fell into this problem with Minutes to Midnight.  Not one song stands above the rest.  I wouldn't go as far as to say they all sound the same but nothing jumps out and grabs you as a song you could listen to over and over again as \\"Breaking the Habit\\" did to me on Meteora or \\"In the End\\" on Hybrid Theory.  After Hybrid Theory I bought Meteora without even thinking about it and was a bit disappointed but overall it's a good album.  I was more careful about Minutes to Midnight and am very disappointed.  The next album they put out I'm afraid I, for one, will be at the stage that bands hate to have fans at: I'll have to listen to it in it's entirety carefully before deciding to buy it.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|In my opinion its a good cd, but not the one i was hoping to hear. I was expecting something like Meteora, but its not as good. They changed their style, the one that made them be unique, now they just sound like other bands...
0316010669|4.0|The book is an entertaining read filled with stories suggesting that our quick decisions made \\"in the blink of an eye\\" can be just as good as (or even better than) decisions made cautiously.  The first part of the book gives examples when snap judgments have turned out good, whereas the second part of the book provides examples when such decisions have turned out bad.  The question then becomes: \\"When should we trust our instincts?\\"<br /><br />The author suggests that we need to work out the \\"right mix of conscious and unconscious analysis on a case-by-case basis.\\"  Although this statement may appear vague for someone who is looking for a direct answer, I believe that Gladwell does provide guidance when one reads the entire book.<br /><br />In the end, I believe the author is trying to make us understand our decision processes a little better.  We need to be wary that we all have snap tendencies based on our own experiences.  As such, decisions would be optimized if we try to identify and filter out irrelevant biases.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Warning!  Spoilers!<br /><br />There really isn't another show quite like THE GILMORE GIRLS.  No other series so thoroughly dedicated to words.  There are no doubt other series with great talk:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER definitely comes to mind.  But no other show that I know put language and witty talk so completely at the heart of what it was trying to do.  Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said that she was inspired by great Hollywood comedies like the Thin Man series and HIS GIRL FRIDAY (one of the few films where the characters talked faster than they did on THE GILMORE GIRLS).  And for five absolutely brilliant and one less than brilliant season the show was magical beyond any reasonable expectation.  Then came Season Seven.  I still watched with great interest.  Well, until the marriage to Chris part (I asked a friend to tell me when Lorelei and Chris busted up and stayed away until they did).  Season Seven was not a truly awful season.  There were still many great moments during the year, including an absolutely splendid series finale, but by the end the show was having fewer and fewer of those wonderful moments that made it so special.<br /><br />One major reason Season Seven struggled so much was the absence of the show's guiding genius.  During contract negotiations at the end of Season Six, the WB offered Amy and her co-producer husband Daniel Palladino a one-year contract.  She wanted the respect to be offered a two-year contract.  The WB refused to budge and she and Daniel left the show.  Since the two of them had either written or directed separately or together the bulk of the episodes on the show, the loss was irreparable.  The show was built mainly around great talk, but what happens when the person most responsible for that talk leaves?  Unfortunately, the brilliance of the talk went with them.<br /><br />Those left behind tried gamely to carry on.  But they also had the misfortune to be left with the remnants of an exceedingly bad story arc that Amy left behind.  Most fans of THE GILMORE GIRLS came to dislike Lorelei at times during Season Six, including Lauren Graham.  While most agreed that Luke was being too secretive about learning that he had a daughter he knew nothing about, most also felt that Lorelei's reaction was excessive.  She became pushy and needy and impatient and just generally unlikable.  Then incredibly stupid by giving Luke an ultimatum to either elope on the spot or lose her.  And Season Six ended with her sleeping with Luke.<br /><br />This whole story arc has to be laid at the feet of Amy Sherman-Palladino and the show had no choice but to continue the arc in Season Seven.  As brilliant as Amy was over the first five seasons, the falling apart of Luke and Lorelei's relationship in Season Six and then whole Chris mess in Season Seven were her worst contributions to the show.  Luckily, it didn't last forever.  By the end of the season Rory had graduated from Yale and Lorelei was yearning to be with Luke, acutely conscious of what she had lost.<br /><br />The season ended on some of the best moments of the year.  One memorable episode had all of Stars Hollow laid out as a vast maze, in a weird plan by Taylor that for once truly worked out.  Lorelei and Luke meet and express some of the regrets that they had felt for some time.  It was a great moment.  But the highpoint of the season and one of the highpoints of the entire series occurred in a scene in which Rory gets her mother drunk enough to sing on karaoke night.  She starts off singing Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" (and the Dolly Parton arrangement, not the overly ornate butchering that Whitney Houston did) in Rory's direction.  But Luke walks in as she sings and inevitably her gaze shifts.  As she sings (and quite well, thank you), you see a world of conflicting emotions overcoming her:  regret, yearning, hope, resignation, good will, and love.  I don't know of another actress on TV other than Lauren Graham who could have pulled it off.  It was one of those utterly perfect TV moments that reminded me not just why I watch THE GILMORE GIRLS but TV in general.<br /><br />Until the very end of the season it appeared that there was going to be a Season Eight.  The CW (which had taken over the show when the WB and UPN merged) hoped to have a 13 or 16 episode shortened season, but in the end Lauren Graham and Alexis Bedell, who were both up for contract renewal, declined to sing new contracts.  But after seeing what turned out to be the series finale I am almost grateful of their decision.  What a lovely end to a wonderful series!  Few shows get to go out perfectly, but THE GILMORE GIRLS managed one of the most perfect finales ever.  As Luke marshals the town for a farewell party (on one day's notice) we get a beautiful episode that allows us both to see all our favorite characters one last time and to say goodbye to them.  Everything that should have been done was done.  Rory is off to join the Barack Obama campaign as a reporter.  Lorelei, when Sookie tells her that the planning of the party \\"was all Luke,\\" realizes that Luke, who is sometimes slow to speak, has shown how he feels about her with actions.  When she thanks him and he tells her that he likes to see her happy you know that they are going to be fine.  You don't even need the kiss that follows.  And the series ends just as it began seven years earlier, Lorelei and Rory sitting in Luke's diner.<br /><br />I'm not sure that this is a show that can be replaced.  Some shows are sui generis, truly one of a kind.  This is one of those.  The premise of a mother and daughter who were best friends was at the heart, but it didn't make it unique.  It was the combination of the amazing group of characters, the wonderful town, and the endless stream of magnificently written scripts.<br /><br />I want to end by praising Lauren Graham.  This was a great cast with a number of remarkably gifted actors.  But Lauren Graham towered above them all.  The Emmys never did her justice.  It is almost inconceivable that she never received a single Emmy nomination.  Yet for seven years she was without serious competition the finest actress on television.  How can such a travesty occur and the Emmys not feel a profound sense of shame?  It is true that last year the Emmys were \\"reformed\\" in order to make it possible for deserving performers more likely to be nominated.  Lauren Graham's name was the one mentioned as an example of such a performer.  Yet even with reform she didn't receive a nomination.  But to me her performance as Lorelei is one of the great achievements of television acting.  No one came anywhere close to her in handling comedy; no one could rival her delivery of the machine-gun like dialogue.  But neither could many rival her with drama.  The karaoke scene I mentioned is a perfect example.<br /><br />I will truly miss this series.d have pulled it off.

B000002GQE|5.0|A day in the life from dawn till dusk, reminiscent of Holst's \\"The Planets.\\" This sounds like a classic film score, and could very well have been adapted as such. Some of the best rock to come out of the '60s, and surprisingly not ranked amongst the greatest ever recorded if my memory serves me right. An often overlooked masterpiece of composing and pure listening pleasure. Puts one at peace with one's self. \\"Nights In White Satin\\" is the finale of all rock finales, with the exception of few.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I wasn't really sure sure what to expect from this since I hadn't seen anything from Chan-wook Park, but having been so disappointed by American movies lately and so impressed by foreign films of late I gave this a try and was very impressed by it.<br /><br />Twisted love story to the nth degree.<br /><br />Pretty much every other review and the film synopsis will tell you the plot so I don't need to rehash that but I will say that the acting was fantastic and the plot twist was unexpected and disturbing. It's certainly not a film for people who like lighthearted themes as this will likely not be the movie for you. It stuck with me for a while and I loved that about it. I just rented Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and am looking for to seeing if it will meet my expectations!

B00005JPFF|4.0|In SPIDER-MAN 3, Director Sam Raimi has kept the tone the same as in the other two great films.  Again, the heart of the film is the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (Tobey McGuire & Kirsten Dunst) and this has been been the driving force of the film series. Each film has been emotionally powerful because of this. However, it might have slightly weighted down this film which is a minor complaint to this reviewer.  It didn't allow the full development of Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) and Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). However, whatever screen time they had, their characterizations were excellent. Once again, another key character in the film series is Peter Parker's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) as Spider-Man's voice of reason.  It's great that the creators of this film series have had the insight to carry over this element from the comics and use it in all three films (even the use of Ben Parker --Cliff Roberston--in flashback sequences). Rosemay Harris as Aunt May has been so good in all three films. SPIDER-MAN 3 had a lot to prove because SPIDER-MAN 2 was such a great film and this film had a lot of information to sift through. Such elements that were added to the plot was resolving the issues of the Peter Parker/Harry Osborn conflict and the real story behind the death of Ben Parker.  Another minor plot complaint is how the alien symbiote just happens to conveniently find Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Then again, this is a film based on a comic book and these type of coincidences happen all the time. The scenes with Peter and the symbiote provide a bit of comic respite in the film between all the mayhem. Tobey McGuire and his portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is probably one of the best comic-book casting adapations to the screen. Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 is a very entertaining and satisfying film. The action and special effects were once again excellent, and the casting was great. Also, with all the plot elements in the story, this film, as in the first two, had another very emotional third act.as in the first two, had another very emotional third act.
B000KJU182|5.0|Excellent Movie.  The theme and the historical accuracy is amazing for the time of the film's making.  The plot brings out the push and pull orf Good & Evil and what can and does happen when the Law meets the Good at right angles.  The Captain must up hold the law and uses his position as the Captain to bend the Courts Martial to see his view of the Law when everything else points to a \\"Not Guilty\\"  To say more will ruin the story.  As another review states if you liked Caine Mutiny Then you will ejoy this movie Too.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album stands alone, when you talk about jazz. I have yet anything that compare's, and probably won't in this liftime. The melody's, chords, and mood that is created on this album is timeless. \\"So what\\" is probably the best opening track I've ever heard on an album period. I could only imagine the chemistry and vibe in the studio, when Miles put this album together. I bet he could sense greatness was taking place, what a talented group of guys. I also wanna thank murray for the chord layouts, you seem pretty conversant in music notation.
1416500286|2.0|Emma is twenty years old, living in the countryside of Victorian England.  Her father is a wealthy hypochondriac, constantly worried about his own health or the health of others.  He dotes on Emma and can see no wrong in anything she does.  Emma's mother died when she was a small child, and her older sister married and moved away some years ago.  This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking. <br /> <br />At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well.  She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor.  Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings. <br /> <br />Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused.  Will she be a successful matchmaker?  Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married? <br /> <br />I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow.  I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book.  Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Edit: 6/16/2009<br />My view has drastically changed on this album. I now support this album and every song on it. I cannot wait for the Transformers movie with their new song New Divide. Rick Ruben has done some amazing albums and songs, including 99 Problems with Jay-Z. Linkin Park wanted to find the real Linkin Park; so hiring Rick to do the job was the most logical reason, and it worked! I wrote my review on the day I bought the album, and it may be a little biased. I apologize for my crash behavior. End  <br /><br />Why oh why did I decide to buy this album and not try it first? My first words as I played the second track in my car and cringing at the 17 second scream of me after chester screams f-word. The new album produced by Rick Ruben and Mike Shinonda...respectively; has a new twist and turn that does one for the worst. Something is different and eerely sickening to the mind on the new first album. I've read other reviews on Amazon and iTunes and it's gotten mostly 3 stars compared to the other two outstanding albums. I am mad that only 6 songs are likeable. Continuing my opinion, Bleed it Out, Shadow Of The Day, What I've Done, Hands Held High (currently my favorite); In Between, and In Pieces are the only songs that are instantaneously likeable. There is no 13 track album where Joe Hahn makes an insanely instrumental with his dj skills, then the following 13th song where it's kinda sentimental. Rick, producers of Stadium Arcadium, Metallica, and a bunch of other stuff researchable on Wikipedia, didn't do too well on this album. Other stuff he did was good, but this album was just junk. I know i've only listened to it for a few hours, and I'll definitly have to let things soak in like with the 2nd Kayne West album. If you have the new album, listening to Breaking The Habit sounds like they got rid of screaming and did more emo or whatever.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Tim Allen mocking Captain Kirk, Sigourney Weaver repeating everything the ship's computer says, classic.  Bored, bitter and alcoholic from touring the conventions, the washed up has beens are suddenly beamed onto a ship modeled on their TV series and expected to defeat a formidable foe.  The problem is -- even though their hosts expect them to know how to do everything (after all, they did on the show) -- they initially can't even perform basic tasks.  This is a silly movie, but if you liked Star Trek and can handle some silliness, this is among the best you can get.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I don't know why I expected this album to be so good, oh wait yes I do, the song What I've Done.  If you liked that song, you will not like this album.  That song is one of the only songs that reminds me of the old LP stuff, and its also one of the only songs on this album that is not quiet, slow and totally not LP.  I understand that bands mature, grow older, change, whatever you want to say, but wow talk about a major change.

I loved the simplicity and realism of two young people, who just met, walking around a beautiful European city like Vienna, and getting to know each other.<br /><br />You might wonder what they have left to talk about in this film since they tackled so many subjects in the previous one.  Believe me, they have plenty to talk about, and you wish that this film would never end.<br /><br />The story takes place nine years after the previous film.  Jesse is now a successful author who is doing a book tour throughout Europe.  Paris is his last stop.  He's sitting in a small book shop, answering questions from some readers, when he looks over his shoulder and sees Celine standing there.  The film takes off from there as Jesse and Celine spend a few precious hours together before Jesse must be at the airport to make his flight.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine) both co-wrote this screenplay along with the director.  It's obvious that these two actors know their characters so well, that I'm sure that even they had spent those \\"nine years\\" wondering how it would end.  Does Jesse come back for that six-month-later reunion?  Does Celine?  Do people, who really live so far away able to keep, what seems to be an unlikely promise?<br /><br />I'm not going to relate anything else about the story here for those who have not seen the movie yet.  This is a film where the thrill is in the journey, not the goal.  Each step that Jesse and Celine make as they walk around Paris, is another step in that journey.<br /><br />I recall telling friends about the first film and what it was about.  They couldn't understand how a movie about two people walking around could be so good.  But just like that first film, their conversations are so real and enthralling.  I think part of the reason that it's so compelling is that when these two characters are together, they are themselves.  There is no fakery or need to put on another face in order to impress the other.  Perhaps because they are in a time crunch, they figure that there's no need to be anything other than genuine because they don't feel that they'll ever see each other again.  There is a powerful scene in this film that is a recognition and a tribute to that \\"genuiness\\" and why they feel more comfortable with each other than with anyone else they've ever been with.<br /><br />I've always said that sometimes the best stories are the simple ones.  And this one is simple, yet again.  These two simple, yet real characters, captivate the audience again with their genuine conversation that holds nothing back, and invites the audience to try and do the same.to put on another face in order to impress the other.

B000NA28IE|5.0|It is hard to believe that such a wonderful book could be a spine tingling and an amazing adventurous movie. Dive head first into the wonderful world of Eragon and get blown away by the adventure, fanasty and friendship. It is a must have.
078681859X|4.0|It was an interesting and exciting book.  The mystery of each chapter made it an exciting read.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|It helps to listen to this new album with an open mind--in particular, to be receptive of LP's evolution.  It is only reasonable that change is inevitable, and to deny that would be to live in a self-induced lie.  On the other hand, those who proclaim that LP sounds completely different fail to see the vestiges of LP's former life.  Notwithstanding the metamorphosis of said, it is an excellent album per-se. <br /> <br />PS: It does help to take some effort to spell things properly, and to use the right word.  For example, take care to differentiate between \\"there\\" and \\"their\\"; the former is a noun representing a location, whereas the latter is a possessive.  If hypothetically someone would like to rant (not to point any fingers at all), and say write repetitive trite phrases in all capital letters, at least make some effort to sound intelligent.
B000002HMH|5.0|The CD arrived in perfect condition and my dad really enjoys his b-day present!! Thanks
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Ok well first off, I'm a music fan of all sorts of music.  From R&B, rap, rock, some country and I've been a fan of LP since the first HT album. The 2nd (Meteora) was another great album.  Now I, like many other fans, heard they were gonna experiment with a new sound but this is starting over.  I've listened to it 1 time and was gonna just disgard it but I've heard that it grows on you.  Well I continued to listen to it another 7 times and have the same conclusion as when I listened to it the 1st time. It's boring, and a not very well put together album.  I'd suggest that Rick Ruben just don't mention at all he helped with it and to LP, that you sweep this under the carpet and get back in the studio quick to try and put out a real album.  This was such a crappy album, that it should be given away instead of trying to make people buy it.   <br /> <br />In conclusion, I ended up just giving it away to a friend and he ended up running it through a shredder.  So it is a terrible album.  IMO, Chalk this album up as a failed experiment and get back to what you do best.  Growing is good but this wasn't a growing album.  It was a total 180 from what you did.  Don't go down this road again.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|A number of established bands have taken a more political stance than ever before the past couple years, and Megadeth is no different.  Since Dave Mustaine re-formed the band (with a new lineup yet again), he's back on track and looking back to the glory days of 80's thrash metal that he helped pioneer.  \\"United Abominations\\" is just that, as Megadeth makes their debut on Roadrunner Records with this raw sounding, politically laced treat that may very well be the album of the year.  Opening track \\"Sleepwalker\\" slams forward with Mustaine's scratchy voice and ripping guitars, while \\"Washington is Next!\\", \\"Never Walk Alone...A Call to Arms\\", \\"Play for Blood\\", and the title track are all excellent metal blasts as well.  What longtime fans of the band will notice right off the bat however is a remake of Megadeth's mid-90's hit single, \\"A Tout Le Monde\\".  Here, we get \\"A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free)\\" which is a faster, more driven version of the song, and it also features Lacuna Coil's Cristina Scabbia on vocals as well.  This is Megadeth at their most raw and primitive sounding since \\"Peace Sells...\\", which in itself is really saying something.  Undoubtedly the best metal album of the year so far, \\"United Abominations\\" is a metal masterpiece.
B000HL0GA6|5.0|The thing I like best about this episode is that is shows the strong spirit of the Enterprise crew.  While traveling in space, the crew meet a mysterious alien race.  Not to tell you too much, but this is the episode where we see them use the phase cannons on the ship to defend it.  Very enjoyable, and for the $1.99 price, you will be glad you downloaded it.
B000O174CM|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching the movie.  As the story unfolded, I kept thinking it was going to get better.  Alas, I was so bored that I turned it off after an hour.  If you like the actors or are big into musicals, then maybe this won't be your opinion.  Yes, they are certainly a talented group of actors/actresses with wonderful vocal cords, it just seemed like a dozen other 'somebody crawled out of anonymity to fame story'.  I felt the dialogue dragged as if someone just retold an old story but freshened the words and added the requisite characters.  I have already told others not to waste their money but revisit a classic such as \\"Ray\\".
0552550299|5.0|This is a fun series with enough depth to entertain teens and adults alike.  I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />Like another reviewer mentioned - the first couple pages lead me to think this was just a Harry Potter clone which is disappointing, but I was very happily mistaken.  The story is rich and fresh all on it's own and doesn't compare terribly closely to HP.   <br /> <br />The stories are complicated enough to keep things interesting and the predictable parts are presented in a way that feels like the author intended you to predict them. <br /> <br />I've just finished reading the trilogy and enjoyed the last book the most - as it should be - each book successively got better. <br /> <br />Enjoy the read.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I am a huge Linkin Park fan since 1998 when they release the EP version of what would be their first album, Hybrid Theory. It was unlike any other album heard in the music industry, blending everything that would connect different styles together: rap, alternative rock, electronica, etc. Then, Meteora dropped and they ventured further outward and give the fans more of what made them famous - - the \\"rap/rock\\" fusion. But, then, they ventured out and toured too much and focused on other project - - the \\"mash-up\\" cd with Jay Z [which was good by the way, wish there were more songs to that]; the Fort Minor record, which was flawless by the way, and were featured with different artists like Adema, Young Buck, Ghostface, Apathy & Lupe Fiasco; just to name a few. <br />When I read nearly a year ago in an old edition of Rolling Stones magazine; that Rick Rubin was gonna produced the record and try to stear away or break the stigma, that is \\"rap/rock\\" on the LP boyz; I was totally against the view. I continue to read further and they said that it would blend sounds like AC/DC, The Clash & Grandmaster Flash & 'ol Skool Rap into the songs; I was nearly relieve and figured that they won't actually change but just mature the sound and keep what made them famous. That was until about nearly two months ago when I found different that they were not gonna go through wit it. <br />Well, when I read just a month or two ago, again in Rolling Stones magazine; that the boyz went in and retooled the album, cut songs and added songs into the album; more ballads and more singin with Chester & less rappin' from Mike. I grew really scared and weary of the album as it approached its deadline. <br />I listen to album and seen the movie of their first performance in New York together in nearly 3 years: It was good, but, not the exact LP that I have grown to love. Here are some reasons as to why the album may not be as a success as their previous albums... <br />1.) Lyrically, yes, they have grown, but just in the wrong direction. In the previous works, they talked a lot more about the struggles within someone and the struggles of relationships; this made them great to hear and connect with. In Minutes to Midnight, they tended to sound like everyone else; talkin bout politics and the War in Iraq; not a great combination. <br />2.) The comrodery between Mike & Chester is losted in this album. In their previous works, Mike & Chester fuels off of each other, giving a raspy & screamin vocals of Chester & deliquite & strong verbal lyricist of Mike. In Minutes to Midnight, Mike is not used as much as he should be in this album; only two songs where he is used in the record & Chester carries the load in this whole record. Not sayin' its bad, which it does do a bit good; however, as a fan, I am extremely disappointed in not givin' Mike a bit more leeway in this album & givin a few more tracks to display what made him a success in their previous albums. Overall, this weighs down the album & it doesnt look promising. <br />3.) There are too many \\"ballads\\" in this album than it should be. It tends to get boring and loose it sting to grasp ahold of any LP fan. In their previous work; from their riffs of their guitars to the sounds of the turn-tables & keyboards & drum patterns was amazing. Plus, each track seem to mesh together and blend extrememly perfect from track to track. In this project, it seems fitting to the title \\"Minutes to Midnight\\"; it seems like that they retooled the album just to meet the deadline. It just not really sounding like them at all and what made them popular. <br />Overall, the album is kinda solid, but, has many places to retooled. The LP boyz were thinking too much about tryin to venture out of their \\"rap/rock\\" fusion that made them famous instead of just making the music that pleased their fans. They said that they made over 50 songs -- I wish they would use those songs and wonder what those sound like. Sure, I will commend them on trying to grow and mature and develop; but, they took too long and thought too hard as to how to \\"mature\\" their sound. There are a couple of songs, including \\"Bleed It Out\\", \\"What I've Done\\" & \\"Giving Up\\" that could give the fans some flashes of the old LP; but, it fails to live up to the hype that they hoped for. But, in the end, I will still be loyal to the group. I just hope that they return to what made them famous. Remember the 'ol saying goes...if it's not broke, don't fix it.
0385333846|4.0|Very interesting - need to read again.  Not sure what the goal of the author was.  Enjoyed the ending more than the first, because it directly dealt with the bombing of Dresden.  I need to re-read, because I am certain I missed much of the message - there is more there than I read.  Writing was creative - but seemed flat - and I suspect for a reason.  Need to re-read.
0743496728|4.0|This was the first novel I've read by Jodi Picoult. It was very good! The subject interested me because there has been two school shootings in Minnesota, the state where I live, and I know Ms. Picoult interviewed some of the students and families involved in those shootings as research for her book. <br /> <br />The book is very well-written, well thought out and well-researched. I felt sorry for everyone involved, especially the antagonist, Peter. The book really makes you think about how your actions affect others. Every day, someone like Peter is bullied in school by someone like Matt Royston or Drew Girard. And nobody really cares until something tragic like a school shooting happens but then, just like after 9/11, people seem to forget and go back to their old ways... <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending. That is why I am giving this book 4 stars, instead of 5. I thought it was extremely abrupt, although very realistic. I couldn't believe how Alex Cormier could just move on with her life with the Detective after her daughter's trial and even get pregnant again! If I were Josie, I'd be really upset, especially considering how that poor girl had no one to look out for her all those years and all the terrible things that had happened to her (the way her father treated her, the way her boyfriend abused her). Her mother -- the only person that poor girl had in her life -- had never been there for her before, and now she wouldn't be there for her again. Usually, I like realistic endings -- even if sad and tragic -- but not this time. <br /> <br />Josie got screwed!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|The first thing that should be noted about Rush's `Snakes & Arrows' is this: This album is not a return to Rush's earlier sound! Purchasing this album with expectations of hearing another `Permanent Waves' or `Moving Pictures' would surely generate some massive amounts of disappointment. However, any fan of Rush should by now understand that Rush will NEVER return to their glory days! Rush is a constantly evolving entity. A return to form would strictly contradict the very foundation of what makes Rush one of the most recognized rock names in history. Rush has always been about creativity, pushing boundaries, and always trying something new. Fortunately, unlike most bands with an ambitious focus, Rush experiment with an acute know-how and end up with exemplary results almost every time. `Snakes & Arrows' is no exception to Rush's stellar catalog.<br /><br />The foremost new element the to brew is a thick, dense layer of texture. As most reviewers have already noted, this is accomplished by the addition of the mellotron from Geddy, and twelve string electric guitars, mandola, mandolin, and bouzouki from Lifeson. Rush has never sounded this thick. These creative additions generate several new dimensions to the already stellar music of `Snakes & Arrows.' Song writing is also much more developed and complicated than former Rush releases. Yes, even more complicated than `Moving Pictures', and far more developed than `2112.' \\"Then why were these releases immortal compared to `Snakes & Arrows'\\" you ask? Because the focus on dense atmospheres and texturing has unavoidably stolen some of the fire from Rush. That fierce Rush passion is generated by forceful speed and toe-tapping strength is largely replaced by slower, glistening pools of sonic beauty. This new height of atmospherics and textural focus will surely turn some fans of earlier material away, but any Rush fan that understands Rush's tenancy to change and experiment will find this new dimension very enjoyable.<br /><br />Remarkably, hand-in-hand with this new element is absolute catchiness. Every song is absolutely moving in depth, but at the same time, delightfully fun. This unique balance is immensely rare in the world of music. A focus on atmospherics generally creates a largely unconventional and sometimes, boring release. Absolutely not the case with `Snakes & Arrows.' Rush truly prove their worth as masterful musicians by balancing their mix with utter flawlessness. There is not one moment when one of the elements overpowers the other. This fun appearance will mask the underlying beauty to the careless ear, but if you pay attention, you will grasp the painstaking effort that was put into creating this album.<br /><br />As far as the musicians themselves go, there is no overt display of virtuoso talent. Geddy Lee keeps his bass completely under control, Alex Lifeson textures all elements beautifully, but feels no need to strut his stuff, and Neil Pert is still master skin-man, yet remains contained. It is obvious that Rush realized their focus, and stuck strictly to it. As a musician, I can appreciate how difficult such an uncanny focus is to accomplish throughout an entire album, and especially one as tediously preformed as this. Every element is utterly perfect, every song utterly beautiful while still being utterly Rush. An absolutely top notch release from one of the greatest bands in rock history.y, hand-in-hand with this new element is absolute catchiness.

B00008GKEG|4.0|This Beatles Anthology DVD set is a great bargain because when it originally came out in the mid 90's on VHS tapes it was about $120 more. I still have a catalog from then to prove it. I was very impressed with the sound quality. The best sound quality I've ever heard Beatles music presented in. Makes me wish my old Beatles CDs sounded that good. On alot of my other DVD's I have to crank the volume way up to get any decent audio. The only thing I didn't like is that during some of the songs like \\"Revolution\\" & \\"Hey Jude\\" there is talking. I'm interested in what they have to say but not during the songs. And it doesn't seem to have a feature where you can just play the music videos. But I guess it's supposed to be a documentary & not a collection of music videos. Also I seem to recall some minor scenes when I saw it on TV in 1995 that weren't on the DVD, like the reunited Beatles in the 90's admiring one of the member's fancy car.
B0000029DD|5.0|If I had to pick one CD to take with me to a far off deserted island, this would be it. His version of \\"Hallelujah\\" is now considered definitive, with good reason, too. If this CD doesn't move you it's a pity because you are missing out on something truly wonderful.
B000NA2776|5.0|This CD is great for singing out loud in your car. Mika is a mix of Freddy Mercury and Robbie Williams. His music is fun and carefree in the style of Queen and it is just a great road album
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|Why do I love this movie!!!???? I just do, no matter how many times it comes on tv,I catch myself watching it. Infact there maybe a sequel to this. Yup you heard right!!
B00005LOLD|4.0|This is a rather silly story line, and Brando is really miscast but as always he is fun to watch.  Red Buttons gives an excellent performance as  a soldier married to a Japanese woman during the occupation.  Still an interesting performance from Brando.
037582913X|5.0|An all time favorite for our three girls while growing up - especially for reading outloud with fun voices!
B0002JY1NQ|5.0|Brando is at his best in this film he directed.  Karl Malden is wonderful as Dad Longworth.  I love the expressions on their faces and the dialogue is great!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I never expected this movie to be so good. The previews did not do it justice at all. The whole atmosphere of bleakness and decay really got to me.<br /><br />The scenes at the abandoned elementary school were particularly moving. You see how things on earth are quickly rotted when no longer needed, when most everyone has given up hope, believing those things to be useless forever.<br /><br />One of the scariest moments occurred deep in the woods, at the hippie's house when their trespasser alarm went off. That alarm was one of the ugliest, most foreboding sounds I've ever heard. And I couldn't get it out of my head for a few days.<br /><br />Another memorable scene is when the good hippie woman is forced off the bus. The last we see of her is someone pulling a black bag over her head.<br /><br />The final scenes by the water were very troubling, desolate. But it is interesting to note that while the anti-gov't \\"terrorists\\" tried to steal the pregnant woman, using violence for the sake of violence and their cause, the government's military stood by in awe as she passed them among the ruins.  The gov't is not entirely evil then. I mean, it looks like they are mostly fighting against the terrorists, which is the right thing to do. But their behavior to the immigrants was very disburbing.  Life is valued in this society, but only if it meets the right conditions. New babies are valued, of course, but if you're an immigrant you're likely to be caged, seen as more animal than human.<br /><br />This movie is also full of sacrifice. Several characters give their lives in order for others to live. So, there is definitely redeeming value in this depressing hulk of a story. Oh, and the soundtrack was excellent too.
B00005JPKE|4.0|I saw this movie on the big screen, and now own it on DVD.  It is a really good movie, although you will probably find the constant reading of subtitles while trying to take in the action quite a challenge, but then watching it on DVD allows you certain controls that you do not have at a Theatre.  I went into that movie with a long instilled hatred of the Japanese because I saw result of what they did to my Uncle who was a prisoner in Changi during WWII. But after watching the movie, I walked out realising that they treated their own soldiers with the same barbarity and cruelty that they did their prisoners.  The Japanese were in no position to show any form leniency to any prisoner, especially when they refused to show any to their own soldiers.      Although I will never forgive or forget what these people had done to my family, I do have a better understanding of why. It was insightful, action packed, and a great watch!

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Years after Metallica lost all credibility and become a parody of themselves, Megadeth keeps on rocking and delivering some of the finest metal out there. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is perhaps the best record.  Musically, it's almost in the same league as Rust In Peace and Killing Is My Business... <br /> <br />For any fan of Megadeth or metal in general, it's an obvious must have.
B00006JKLI|5.0|I've found it hard to find reviews just for the DVD-A or SACD versions of releases. There really should be a separate section for them. Hello Amazon...how about showcasing these great audio formats! Also, Amazon, is it too much to ask that you start listing kHz/bits ?!! It would sure be nice to know when looking at a potential purchase whats on the disc. Is it 48kHz/24bits? Or 96kHz/24bits? etc etc etc. Come on now, help these formats out!    Anyway, the DVD-A is my 4th version of this album. Vinyl, Tape, CD, and now DVD-A. Holy audio nirvana folks! This is one of the best in my small, but continually growing DVD-A and SACD collection. If you loved this album in any of its forms and have the equipment to both play AND hear it....and you appreciate good sound.... you will be blown away. Phenomenal! A showcase of how good older recordings can and should sound. I'm partial to the 96kHz/24bit stereo track, but the 96kHz/24bit DVD-A surround is good too. I'm just a bit of a purist.     This is a benchmark for re-releasing older albums in a wonderful format. In our over compressed MP3 dumbed down world it's too bad more attention isn't paid to either of the formats. SACD or DVD-A.
B000MV9026|1.0|I was incredibly dissapointed by the producers of this movie by them insensitively incorporating the \\"Hollywood Latino stereotype\\" for the other Penguins. It was incredibly uneccesary and racist. Just because the penguins are from Argentina they must speak that way and its appropriate? <br /> <br />I find it unfortunate that a family film can have such insensitive images of a group of people. This movie is trying to make it seem that all people who speak Spanish act the same way. <br /> <br />Had this movie had monkeys from Africa speaking in jive..EVERYONE would be up in arms, and this movie does exactly that with Spanish people.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|The new Linkin Park album has gotten bad reviews and people saying that the ban is going in the wrong direction.  As I listened to the album I was dissapointed that the Linkin Park sound was gone, missing.  After their last album I could not wait to hear more of it.  But as I listened to Minutes to Midnight i realized something else.  This is quality music.  The only reason I was having a hard time with the album was exaclty do to the bands new sound.  Once I began to get use to it I got into the album.  I do hope that they return to their old sound though, becasue I could never get tired of it.
0375703764|1.0|It wasn't scary.  It wasn't interesting.  It wasn't particularly well-written.  It was difficult to read.   In short, WTF?
1577314808|1.0|It is self-contradictory that authors like Tolle claim problems are mind-made. If problems do not exist at all in their mind, then why do they perceive that others have problems? Why do they provide solutions? Ask you to follow their prescription? Why do these people write a book or ask you to attend their workshops? For otherwise if you do not follow, it will only make you further depressed.  <br /> <br />Their problem is that their NOW `thinks' (do not know how they can think when their mind is still) others have problems and they are the only enlightened beings. If they expound an idea that in reality there are no problems, they should refrain providing solutions or stop writing books about the subject. It is amazing how a well educated society falls for the rhetoric and follows the path to an illusionary Garden of Eden.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Will Ferrell as IRS agent Harold Crick seems at the edge of an abyss. Complacency, sameness, loneliness lure him into the empty hole of existence vs. living.<br /><br />One day, during his non-wavering daily routine, he hears a voice, a narrator.<br /><br />Clever slightly mocking to often sarcastic dialogue and narration invited me to laugh out loud several times. The characters are rich. Subtle special effects and camera angles created a sense of impending doom and made the movie alternate between racing to the conclusion and standing still, peeking into Harold's abyss.<br /><br />Not everyone is going to care for this movie. Some will detest it. If you can't stand Will Ferrell in any of his movies, you may not be able to get beyond the similarities to his innocent, childish characters. If you expect him to overreact and quip dirty jokes, you're going to have to stretch to find it in Stranger.<br /><br />Part love story, part second-chance-at-life story, part suspense, part character-sketch Stranger than Fiction feels Woody Allenish without the whining. The seriously logical may struggle with the \\"must suspend belief in reality here\\" happenings.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson play off and twist stereotypes, and breathe new life into them. The coffee swilling professor who \\"helps\\" Harold, and the chain-smoking blocked author who \\"ruins\\" Harold's life both add charm and quirk to this film.<br /><br />If you love The Truman Show, Big Fish, Joe vs the Volcano, Woody Allen, or feel-good movies in general, you may find much to like in Stranger than Fiction. If you like clever, unique or words, give it a shot.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. I have always adored Romeo and Juliet. I love Shakespeare's poetic language. This movie is both funny and moving and poignant. The first time I watched it I was thrilled. And it has gotten better every single time I have watched it. And by now, I have probably watched it 35 times. It still makes me laugh. It still makes me cry. It still makes me sigh. It still makes me put my hand over my heart and gently shake my head at it's brilliance.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies.<br /><br />Will Ferrell fans fall into two camps: the ones that appreciate his raunchy side, and those who find his goofy innocence charming.<br /><br />I'm in the second camp.<br /><br />My children and I quote Elf often. \\"Does somebody need a hug?\\" is a favorite.<br /><br />But I know perfectly wonderful people who hated the movie.<br /><br />If you go for art or brilliant acting/writing, or a deep heartfelt message to take away with you -- you probably shouldn't go there with Elf. The logical will be annoyed with the elf adoption and flying sleigh logistics.<br /><br />But if you find it at all amusing when grown men wear tights and get sideswiped by taxis, Elf may be singing your song. Does excessive childlike behavior no matter how old the child, coax a smile? Then Elf may be a movie you'll add to your favorites list.<br /><br />Elf may fall into that category with Napoleon Dynamite...either you love it or you hate it. And I'm a Napoleon fan.  I even loved Nacho Libre, Three Amigos and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Give me an excellent sight gag, some physical humor and a few great one-liners and I'm in.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I agree, season 7 was not the best season of Gilmore Girls, but this will not affect the 5+ stars this series rates for me.  <br /> <br />This series has a preferred place in my heart like no other due to the similarity of my relationship with my own mother. It was a show we enjoyed together and we could relate to most of the times. It was smart, educating, sensitive and funny.  <br /> <br />It impressed me week after week how much you could learn from this show, at the same time as you where laughing, crying or getting angry. This show proves that tv series can be educating and fun at the same time, for everyone and any generation. I was also impressed how people I knew where a little skeptical about the show (mainly men) and how fast they got hooked up with it (again men!).  <br /> <br />Even though the last episode felt to fast ad ended to soon, I have to say that I like it how the final emotion was. The show ended at the correct moment, I believe another season could have been boring and negative to the show. <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls will always be a 5-Star for me! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minutes to Midnight is a reflection of the world as it is today.  The lyrics capture an angry kind of sadness that meshes brillantly with the compelling music.  This album gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it.  It can hold it's own along side any of Linkin Park's other great albums.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|LP is one of my favorite bands!  It is difficult to find a band that rocks and does not cater to bubble gum school kids.  LP has shown that they can be very innovative with their music and I think Meteora epitomized that notion.  The first and second albums were some of the best modern rock that I have heard!  I guess every good thing must come to an end... I understand that bands want to evolve and grow as musicians, but LP does not need to do it this way!  Do not ever, ever, ever, ever, ever go soft LP.  I listened to a friends CD and will not be buying this.  I think this band needs to step back and evaluate what made them great.  Buyer beware, LP has gone soft and has decided to sell out.  LP, the next CD had better be harder than ever before because this thing stinks!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I have always liked Linkin Park.  Based on the reviews that I have read, I didnt expect much from this CD.  It doesnt affect me if this CD is good or bad, I have lots to listen to and if LP is done, someone better will be along shortly.  I have listened to it three times and I really enjoy it.  I read alot of these reviews to find new music or to see what people are saying about a CD before i purchase it.  In this case, people have been judgemental about the band changing style or production.  Get over it, You will never duplicate the period in your life where you were rockin to Hybrid Theory.  You grew up and so did the band.  I listen to alot of diffrent music and honestly and objectively I can say this is a great CD.  Diffrent but still good.  I have been into a lot of rap lately and Im glad that LP can bring me back to rock for awhile.  I suggest you listen to it for yourself before you discount it due to others opinions.  Again, this is a great CD that flows very well, Chester sounds great, the beats are total LP and it has good clean production with Rubin. Its not bad like the haters say it is.  If you dont like it thats one thing (maybe you should try country) but dont deny that these guys put together a good cd.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|i LOVE LP but hateeeeeee this album...it doesnt even sound like them! I had to relook at make sure i bought the right CD!  the lyrics are so emo and whoever wrote them is highly disturbed.  overall NOT impressed!!!!
0440241030|5.0|Inexorable like any good thriller should be, where the conclusion is surprising, yet completely inevitable, THE HARD WAY, carefully eases its iron-jawed lead character, Jack Reacher into a spiral of trouble that only a man of his kind can get into. Even minding his own business, he ends up witnessing part of a kidnapping plot and is soon sucked into a gripping plot involving a band of mercenaries, murder (the bad kind) and some judicious arm-breaking with fireplace implements. Man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.  Reminded me of Todd Buchholz's new thriller THE CASTRO GENE. Check 'em both out.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|After crying all throughout the series finally I have to say that it really was time to say goodbye and I would buy this seasons set for the last episode alone!  That scene when Lorelai and Luke make-up is precious and as a fan of the show from the beginning I truly feel that in that moment Lorelai is completely happy, and she finally realized that Luke is a big part of that happiness.  The show has definitely had it's up and downs but I'm giving it 5 stars because as a whole I have never seen a show like this one and don't think I ever will. I often feel that GG fans are so hard on the show because they really don't realize how good we had it, we got use to such a high standard of writing and acting that anything less brought out red flags.  Nonetheless, it seems unreasonable to think that the series could keep that standard for every episode in every season, especially after the original creators left abruptly after the sixth season.  So whatever that's worth I feel this show is a great investment and although it's centered around a mother-daughter relationship, a lot of men like the show as well even though they might not like to admit it:-)     <br /> <br />Growing up with the Gilmore Girls has been such a pleasure and I cannot wait for the day when I can re-watch the series with my daughter and relive all that funny banter, crazy town meetings and just all the wonderfully unique characters...I think Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson will go down as having some of the best chemistry on TV as we watched their love grow and Alexis Bledel has a great future ahead.  I think I will instinctively follow these actors around and continue to see their new work, how could I not?  After seven grateful years I feel like I know them, and as the song goes, \\"Where you lead I will follow...\\" Thank you Gilmore Girls for such a wonder journey!  You will be missed! <br />
B00005JPFB|4.0|Have not seen much Spanish cinema nor much of  Spanish History on the big screen but this film was enthralling. As with most good films you have to pay attention to all the subplots and characters. This is not your typical American blockbuster movie where you can sit back and let it wash over you! Costumes sets music all first rate - a very satisfying film and one I would watch again.

Get a life, set goals, and do something every day to make your dreams a reality.  Brian shows many ways to get the job done.  Pick one, pick all, pick the one that works for you.  I like the one on creative procrastination in which I choose not to do the unimportant tasks and just take the time to work on the necessary, important tasks. It gives me more time to do other things with freedom.  Enjoy this slim but meaty read.
0767827791|3.0|Years after become famous for his role in the film version GOLDEN BOY, William Holden was still working against being typecast in \\"hunk\\" roles, none  odder than the drifter Hal in this this beautifully photographed film version of William Inge's famous drama of loneliness in small-town Kansas.There were so many younger fine actors who could have played the part--Brando, Newman, Ralph Meeker (the latter two who played Hal on Broadway)--that it's a bit astonishing to wonder what the studio saw in Holden: he's certainly got the torso for the part, but he's fifteen years older than his love interest in the film (Kim Novak) and seven years older than Cliff Robertson, who plays his college classmate--and he looks it, too. And the role of the boisterous braggart Hal is almost exactly wrong for the ruminative Holden's talents. But he's still fine enough an actor to be moving, and he and Novak have an incredibly memorable slow erotic dance to the tune of \\"Moonglow\\" at the Labor Day festivities of the film's title for which alone it is worth seeing the entire movie.  <br /> <br />Novak is herself ideally cast as the insecure passive beauty queen Madge Owens, and she has solid support from Verna Felton as the sensible Mrs. Potts and Arthur O'Connell as the bewildered Howard Bevans. As the loud and awesomely lonely schoolteacher Rosemary Sidney, Rosalind Russell is also very well cast, although she tends to overplay her hand too much (as she always did in her later years); Susan Strasberg tries hard as Madge's intellectual sister Millie but is far too beautiful to be taken seriously as a teenage \\"goon.\\" The screenplay is a bit too worked out and stagey, but the gorgeous James Wong Howe cinematography beautifully displays that midwestern American Gothic territory so peculiar to the work of William Inge--that odd and fascinating combination of wide open landscapes and claustrophobically repressed emotional space.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Nice small size, works well for in-house portraits, especially good with the bouce to create warm nicely lit shots w/o the deer in the spotlight harsh glare of a straight-on shot
B000OCXFCO|4.0|First, to get some things quickly out of the way, despite the pre-release hype, United Abominations DOES NOT represent a return to the classic thrash metal days of 1990's Rust in Peace or 1986's Peace Sells...But Who's Buying.<br /><br />What this album is though, is an extremely solid traditional metal release that has a bit more riffage than 2004's The System Has Failed, but not quite as much of the enjoyable variety that that 2004 effort showed.<br /><br />United Abominations strengths are the great guitar interplay throughout and the compact but intricate arrangements.  The CD is just a little under 49 minutes in length.  Dave Mustaine's vocals continue to improve and this album might represent his best vocals yet.  The production is also clear as a bell and very punchy.<br /><br />Now for the negatives, the lyrics are WAY too topical and sometimes he tries to cram too many words into the space of a particular song.  There are also a bit too many spoken word passages as well, at first they're effective but then get a little annoying.  There also isn't quite as much as variety as 2004's The System Has Failed (which I thought was a fantastic album and I've been a Megadeth fan since they first came out in 1985).<br /><br />The thing that sticks out like a sore thumb on this album though is his ill-adivsed re-make of the 1994 track \\"A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free)\\" from the album Youthanasia.  The original version of this track was great as is.  While I realize that this track is one of Dave's all time personal favorites songs of his, there was no need to re-work it, other than to give this album something to cross over to the mall core masses as it features guest vocals from the hot chick from the awful mall-core metal band Lacuna Coil.  He sped up the tempo a bit and changed some words here and there, but it's still pointless and completely doesn't gel with the rest of the album.  Take this one track off and the album flows better in terms of overall feel.<br /><br />While a lot of hardcore fans were really hoping this would be a return to Megadeth's thrash metal days, it's not that at all.  This album has a bit more of a thrashier feel at times in terms of the guitar tones, but this album is just very good traditional metal.  Megadeth quit being a thrash metal band on 1992's Countdown to Extinction and it appears that while this album might be a small sign that these days might be returning at some point, on this album it didn't happen.<br /><br />Not that that's a bad thing though IMO.<br /><br />Recommended!l. <br /> <br />While a lot of hardcore fans were really hoping this would be a return to Megadeth's thrash metal days, it's not that at all.

B000001GJU|5.0|I'm obviously not as \\"into\\" classical music as I should be as I wasn't familiar with The New World Symphony until I happened to hear the National Symphony perform it in March 2007.  But it's a beautiful piece of music with not one, but several, beautiful melodic lines that I recognized, but hadn't previously associated with this piece of music.  \\"Oh, that's from the New World Symphony!\\"  It's gorgeous stuff.<br /><br />One thing that's sort of interesting about this symphony is that Dvorak doesn't repeat his melodic themes very often.  There are some beautiful strains, but you'd best catch them when they arise because he clearly doesn't have a lot of repeats built into the score.  On the plus side, this characteristic of the music encourages re-playing the CD.<br /><br />Let me also say a few words about Smetana's \\"Moldau.\\"  This CD is more expensive than some other \\"New World\\" CDs, but I think it's worth the price premium due to \\"Moldau.\\"  \\"Moldau\\" is, as I understand it, the national song of the Czech Republic.  It's a lovely tune, you can almost hear the river flowing through Prague.<br /><br />I've found myself playing this CD a lot, which is the ultimate testimony to its virtues.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the best investment for a nature/planet documentary you can get.  It provides the most interesting facts and video that you've probably never come across even if you are into biology.  Recommended for kids to watch over mindless cartoons.  Sadly the last disc goes a little too far into how they think we should control our global warming problem.  Plus some of the footage is repeated sporadically through the discs which was a let down.  Overall though you can't beat the quality and quantity for the price.
1591841666|4.0|If you're facing a go/no-go decision, you'll find The Dip to be a useful, concise guide -- one you might actually have time to read in a gut-wrenching situation.   <br /> <br />Conventional wisdom from sports coaches, business coaches and life coaches alike, urges us not to quit when the going gets rough.    But what if you're truly on the road to nowhere? <br /> <br />In mapping the road to success, Godin has deconstructed the difference between a truck-sized pothole and a dead-end.  He may have oversimplified the scenarios, but who has time to read more than road signs when driving in the fast lane?
B00000K31Q|3.0|10 Things I Hate About You is another variation of Taming the Shrew and generally succeeds in its attempt to keep things light-hearted and humorous. Its strength is in its script since it is brimming with dry humor about our modern teens. <br /> <br />Yet, where this movie falls flat is in its insistance on staying true to Hollywood forulas and making a forgetable carbon-copy of so many other boy-meets-girl stories. <br /> <br />A good movie to watch on a date, but it won't stand the test of time.
B000HWZ4A2|3.0|I've never read Ayn Rand, and this Grand Guignol monodrama doesn't inspire me to start now-- the subtlety of a jackhammer (including an *actual* one), the extreme one-dimensionality of virtually all aspects of this movie,  the confusion of intransigence with principles, and the naive suggestion that all that is mainstream is inherently bad and all that is non-conformist is inherently good, paints an outrageously cartoon world.  It is a fairy tale that only those who choose to \\"play the victim\\" (of society) would find appealing. <br /> <br />In spite of all that (actually, mostly *because* of it) I give it three stars.  It does have 1) great production value, 2) quite a bit of laugh-out-loud unintentional burlesque and 3) instills a total amazement that anyone could ever take this remotely seriously even as a metaphor or morality play. <br /> <br />It is in fact, Le Théâtre de l'Absurde which, if intentional would have done Camus proud.  I shudder to think that Rand's outlook on life in society was truly as vacuous as is suggested by this movie.  But she wrote the screenplay, and apparently had *complete control* so it's not like one can blame someone else for its shallow idealisms.  All this makes the claims that \\"the book is a lot better,\\" rather faint praise, IMHO.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I have been a loyal follower of Megadeth since the 1980's, and even though they have had their peaks and troughs over the years, they have finally delivered their best album since \\"Countdown\\". What I really admire with this new work is that Metallica usually set the pace for innovation (and not always successfully), but how the tide has turned! Dave Mustaine - if he had stayed with that mob then the world would have missed some awesome music. <br />Anyway onto the album. Firstly the production is first class, with Mustaine and Andy Sneap making us wait 8 months overtime to finally get this masterpiece. To not rush it out when tour mode was at full throttle has been the masterstroke, with a concerted effort paid to the dynamic of the sound and pacing of the album. <br />And this is what wins me over - the mix of thrash and just out and out heaviness (almost like a crossover between Rust in Peace and Youthanasia). <br />It had been tried before with Cryptic Writings, but what that album lacked was \\"Angst\\", which is crucial to the Megadeth sound. <br />Track by Track Synopsis. <br /> <br />1. Sleepwalker -  an unexpected thrash metal assault with some of the coolest lyrics Dave has written for some time. The venom in which he spits this out is glorious. The work of the Drover brothers and LoMenzo in their debut song shows us they will be reckoned with for years to come. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. Washington is Next! - Guitar, guitar, guitar!!!  Probably my favorite song on the album! Sounds like Hangar 18 on caffeine. (and Dave is at his political bruising best when it comes to lyrical content). It's foot to the floor stuff! 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Never Walk Alone....A call to Arms - Probably the quiet achiever on this album. The way the song is constructed, metal riffs with a glorious radio friendly chorus make for a fantastic number. Write it off at your own peril! 8/10 <br /> <br />4. United Abominations - Heard this was their finest moment on the album before purchasing.First impressions weren't much, but I must admit I have done a complete about face on this song - which to say after repeated listenings - is just awesome. The midsection is at its heaviest, and even though cliched, the lyrics are catchy and well written. Glen Drover's axe does the talking and almost steals the show, kinda like Marty Friedman used to. Pure Megadeth! 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Gears of War - Simplicity can be the best of things, and I know this song has been bandied around for sometime now, making it seem a little stale to hardcore fans. Not so! Awesome song! Lyrically straight to the point and you probably haven't heard better production in a Megadeth song. For the naysayers, imagine this album without this song. It is the linchpin which connects new with the old and is one of the finest moments - heavy, dark with sneering guitar work and drum work to rival Nick Menza. Do not underestimate this song - metal at its finest! 9.5/10 <br />6. Blessed are the Dead - Not as catchy as some on the album and lack of big chorus is noticeable. Musically though it holds its own with Dave revisiting one of his favorite topics - the Four Horsemen of the Appocolypse. 6/10 <br /> <br />7. Play for Blood - This is the one I love to crank up loud when stuck in traffic. Ballsy, shredding, bouncing guitar work which would not have been out of place on some of their earlier works. This is Dave at his most chaotic, lyrically and the way he sings. Dripping with angst, Dave provides us with another unique facet of this album - Megadeth can still be as nasty as anyone, without the overkill! Musically brilliant! 8.5/10 <br /> <br />8. A Tout Le Monde - I think I am the only person who believes this is an improvement on the original! Not because it is a duet. Not because it has been sped up. But for the way it is sung! I always felt something was missing from the original - and now I know what it was. The older songs chorus was spat with venom, but this newer version is sung from the soul. Listen to the way he sings \\"these are the last words I'll ever speak\\" and compare the two. Dave speaks from the heart in this newer version, almost like its his last chance to get this song across to a wider audience. It is this feeling that resonates through this newer version. I believe for what the song is about, Dave has finally nailed it! Just don't skip to the next track when this comes on, listen for the heart that has been put into this one. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />9. Amerikhastan - Pretty cool! Spoken word is not usually my forte, but Dave manages to pull this one off. Heavy and dripping with sarcasm, it emulates what Megadeth are all about politically these days. Getting across the point, no matter what your point of veiw! 7/10 <br /> <br />10. You're Dead - A surprise really, came out of left field. My reasoning is that at number 10 on the album you usually get filler - not so this time (could have been track 2 for example). Good tempo changes with angry guitar work and Dave running amok at the mouth. Top stuff! 8/10 <br /> <br />11. Burnt Ice - More I listen the more I'm hooked. In a similar vein to the previous track, Dave amps up the guitars for one final aural assault, leaving us wanting more! Perfect closer to the album. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall, I hope you can have a listen to the tracks from my perspective of a longtime Megadeth fan. I really do hope this is the beginning of a new era for the band. And even though it may fall short of the heady days of Megadeth's classic line up, I believe this ensemble of musicians that Dave has acquired can lead us to a reincarnation of what Megadeth truly is - the loudest nastiest and most talented of the four NWOAHM bands(New wave of American Heavy Metal). <br /> <br />Just go and buy it and enjoy!!!! <br /> <br />
0446528056|5.0|Another must read by Nicholas Sparks.  REALLY, REALLY ENJOYED THIS!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I'm a BIG fan of hybrid theory, one of my all time favorite cds the songs never get old. When I first heard What I've Done on Myspace I thought okay this new album sounds great. So I marked my calendar for today and went and picked it up. After listening to the whole cd the only real LP song is What Ive done, I felt robbed. They released that song to give you a flavor for that album but the after-taste wont wash out now. After listening to that CD I had to pop in some heavy metal to get it out of my head. This CD is boring, uninspired and lame. I'm sure all the girlies will love it but not us metal-heads. Maybe I'll listen to it if I can't get to sleep otherwise it'll be collecting dust. STAY AWAY FROM THIS!
B0009MAO46|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theatre while I was in college.  I never DREAMED I would be watching it with my kids, and it would still be a favorite 12+ years later!  This movie is destined to be on the all time classic list.  The lessons learned in this movie are great for kids of all ages, while still being enjoyable for adults to watch.  My kids can quote whole blocks of dialogue from the movie, love to re-enact scenes, and still ask for toys from this movie.  We first had it on VHS, and had to replace it because we literally wore out the tape.  Now you would think that we must watch a lot of TV in our house, but we don't!!  We have a movie night once a week as a family, and this is one they would watch almost every time if I let them.  It's a great movie for the whole family.
B000003FMY|5.0|The only comparable orchestra to Reiner's late fifties Chicago Leviathan was another Midwestern ensemble a few hundred miles to the east in Cleveland (also commanded by an expatriate Hungarian Jewish maestro). <br /> <br />It's a toss up over which orchestra was better, but this disc features ensemble playing of such overwhelming strength and authority that I can hardly think of a Szell/Cleveland recording that tops it, especially since the RCA Living Stereo sound is far better than the shabby sonics of Columbia/Sony. <br /> <br />Glinka's \\"Russlan and Ludmilla: Overture\\" alone is worth the unbelievably low admission price. The orchestra is simply on fire and it was captured in fabulous fifties sound that hasn't aged. <br /> <br />If a little tape hiss puts you into a hissy fit then by all means avoid this disc. (And also avoid those musty old paintings in the Prado and the Metropolitan.) Otherwise just buy it and crank up the volume to something approaching the hundred-plus decibels Reiner heard as the CSO burned onto tape one of the finest recordings in the history of classical music.
B0009O9LWK|5.0|I just love this version of Jane Eyre with George C. Scott. I always remembered this from watching it many years ago, and was very surprised and pleased to see that it was out on DVD; I purchased it immediately. It did not disappoint, as was every bit as I had remembered it.  The film has a very old quality to it, and is not perfect, but does not bother me, I like something that seems old and vintage.  Exquisite version.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|I have read all the Bond novels at least twice. I've seen all the movies several times. Craig is good. He looks tough. He looks cold and calculating. Even though, he is blonde, he looks convincing. I like the gimmick that he is starting his career. The first time he looks at himself in a fitted tux was pretty cool. The \\"Do I look like I care?\\" remark about the martini was good. The Aston Martin was a nice touch. The Walter PPK was left out.  <br /> <br />The plot was okay. They merged into the original novel territory about half way through. Some of the action sequences were awesome. The chase scene at the beginning was very exciting. The pursued was making Jackie Chan type stunts. <br /> <br />The problems I have are two-fold. First, Craig is almost as bad as the terrorist he is trying to stop. How many people did he kill in the embassy? Maybe, they just got burn. He is reckless with other people lives and he lost some sympathy there. Second, the movie is too long. I know they are doing character development, but the plot is too long and the holes in the plot start appearing at the end. I don't want to spoil the ending, but one character makes stupid, contradictory choices. Furthermore, the whole building falling down scene was silly. It is like the car chase going down a tree in Jurassic Park. It is a director or the stunt coordinator trying to be impressive instead of in the moment of the picture.
0385340559|5.0|Ex-Army, ex-M.P Jack Reacher has a debit card, a bank account and very little else.  He is a drifter who takes off on a whim but doesn't even own anything.  When he checks the bank statement he finds a significant amount of money has been deposited in his account.  This is a signal from Frances Neagley, one of nine in his army unit, so he calls her office and her assistant tells Jack she is in L.A.  They meet at a Denny's where she tells him one of their own, Calvin Franz, was tortured, his legs broken and thrown out of a helicopter.  She called all of the eight in their special unit and only Jack has answered so far.<br /><br />At Frances' office they figure out he had a post office box so when they open it there is a thumb drive in it.  When they place it into a computer and get the password they find a spread sheet with numbers on it.  It also has five names on it and they believe the person's real name is Azhari Mahmoud and the other four names are aliases.  Two other team members arrive while three others are murdered but when they figure out what the numbers mean, they realize they are dealing with a danger international in scope and whoever is behind the murders must be stopped at all costs.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is one of the most interesting anti-heroes in thrillerdom.  He stays under the radar but is a believer in justice and that idealism makes him a warrior who fights when necessary.  He is a survivor in a world that doesn't understand him yet he has friends that are totally loyal to him.  There is adrenaline pumping action in this enthralling thriller but it is the unity of the group that that makes BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE a special reading experience.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I've been waiting for this album to come out since about 2 months ago.  I've been counting down days to go and buy this album.  The very first thing I did today was rush over to the record store and pick this up.  I was pretty amazed at how mindblowingly good this was.  Despite that is the 21st century, Megadeth still remained heavy as hell on their new album.  this is amazing.  \\"Sleepwalkers\\" was a great opener.  \\"Washington is next\\" is an awesome politically inspired song that rocks real hard.  All the following songs pretty much ruled.  I didn't have to skip one track.  It was one heavy, hard metalfest from beginning to end.  If anyone is unsure about this album thinking Megadeth might have softened up, you are dead wrong.  Get this album!  The political songs were amazing too with incredible lyrics.  Buy, buy, buy.
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|I don't get all the people saying they're true LP fans. I am glad to say that I'm a true LP fan. I've been following LP since HT. But those who expect the Nu-Metal recordscratching LP, this album won't cure your itch. Think of this album as more reflective of the band members themselves....not just record-scratching and electronics, given that's still sweet. But this is definately gonna be a big one for 2007....oh yea baby!
B00004YZFR|4.0|This all happened years before I was born so it's not surprising it took me so long to check out the documentary. After all this time, I'm glad that I finally did. And I'm glad that someone filmed it all so that I could.<br /><br />Gimme Shelter is an amazing documentary. It starts out a bit slow, with the Stones watching footage of their concerts and listening to tapes of people calling into radio stations to talk about the event. Seeing their reactions is pretty moving, and just to watch Mick Jagger do anything is pretty interesting in itself.<br /><br />As the footage of the concert itself unfolds, it starts out looking like one of the best events ever. A free concert with huge stars and all the drugs you can handle... but then things take a turn for the worse. And the amazing thing is that it is all on camera. The Hell's Angels attacking the crowd, and the crowd attacking the Hell's Angels... and Mick Jagger pleading with everyone to just \\"be cool\\".<br /><br />What a stunning documentary. Check it out if you're interested in rock, history, or just plain good documentaries.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Different can be good, in this case it's excellent!  While there are some hints at the old, it's mostly a new amazing blend of sounds and styles.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I read the reviews and am glad I went with these.  Other headphones have better spec.'s, but these really deliver!  There is nothing better on the market for 3 times the money.  You will look at them, feel how light they are, and wonder how they can possibly provide the sound quality (handling the deep bass(s) as well) they do.  Buy them and enjoy.
B00004SVID|4.0|The live version of the Wall is a must have for advid fans of Pink Floyd. Seeing the group perform in years(decades) past gives me an appreciation for any of their music recored live on a CD.  Its that simple.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Well, I'd give this CD a rating of 8.5/10 <br /> <br />They did something different in this CD, and a lot of fan prob won't like it(their loss), since this CD is less intense than the previous 2-3 CD. <br /> <br />Personally I like this one in its own way. There are more \\"slow\\" pace songs on this CD. Though still have a couple fast pace intense songs just not as much as the previous ones. Lesser rap, which works for me, though I do think Mike Shinoda is an awesome rapper, and that's a huge compliment coming from me since I don't really like rap that much. <br /> <br />Personally I just love Chester Bennington's vocal, with such passion and intensity. My mom loves his vocal too, I think my mom is the only Asian mother in her age group that likes Linkin Park which is awesome. (She also like Green Day's lead vocal too) <br /> <br />Though Chester still did awesomely in this CD with his vocal parts, still, I'm feeling I'm not getting enough, I feel like there need to be like 2 more song of him screaming. I do love his slow, melow vocals songs too, I just need more pumping though, that is why I give it 8.5/10 which 10 - 2 more screaming songs I need but add .5 for new style so 8.5
