0761169431|4.0|This book comes with an ample supply of paper to practice with. This makes a great gift for a child over the age of 8. Some of the pieces are very challenging to fold and requires patience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Hope you enjoyed as much as I did!!!!! Looking forward to the rest of the books.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This one is definitely a guilty pleasure. Would recommend to anyone who just wants to sit back and enjoy a show.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Written so well, keeping the reader so in tune with the characters and feeling like your in their lives! This book made all emotions surface!
B00004RD54|5.0|I used to own this album in an eight-track format  many years ago. Just bought it in CD format, still rocks after all these years!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My mom has a lot of trouble sleeping but when I made her listen to this she fell asleep. It made me so tired. I love this app.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This is is the best and most realistic game I d/l for the Kindle Fire. I play this the most  an play anyone on the  Kindle network or challenge a Facebook friend and even 5 levels and you can even have private games.<br /><br /> Only cons are that the ball and the cue sometimes  do not appear, to use for 5 minutes or more
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was a good book with a lot of action can't wait for the next one. Great job Mr. Riordan
B0081SPK0I|1.0|Paid for this game on the Kindle HD Fire, but it will not play right side up, no matter how many times one plays. This occurred with many other games i bought for my Kindle HD Fire
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I rated this book five because it was really funny and it taught me. Some new things that I could do one day and it also taught me things not to do and things to do and things I love
B006OCM0G0|5.0|5 of 5 stars. the product is what i ordered and there was not a problem with it. It made a great gift.....
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Best app game I have played ever.  Plenty of missions to keep you busy and enjoying every moment of it. Smooth controlling and nice graphics make it hard to set down.

B0026MOVO6|5.0|The VOICE Had done it again with this album this is my Favorite Album of hers because it steers more away from that pop diva image she obtained in the 80'S and Early 90's although her voice wasn't as strong as it once had been it was still better than most artist and no artist could beat Whitney Vocally the only people who come close are Mariah Carey of Course and Deborah Cox. This album works with more modern music producers Like Baby Face,Miss Elliott, Rodney Jerkins , and Ms.Houston herself. All in All this is Whitney's second Best Album with her Debut Album being The first(Whitney)
B0086700CM|5.0|5 of 5 stars. the product is what i ordered and there was not a problem with it. It made a great gift.....
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I have this game over reviews the rating would be 4 stars but I'm saying chapter 2 is going to be a new map there minor problems like the screen and barely any scattered papers so it could be better
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|5 of 5 stars. the product is what i ordered and there was not a problem with it. It made a great gift.....
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Too many new and less interesting characters.  Repetitions to help new readers catch up<br />are annoying.  The story lines are still exciting and interesting but the prose is not as lyrical<br />or as pointed.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Stick man is a game where you create 2 stricken and one of them gets taken away and its up to you to save him you go through different courses and levels until you get your friend back
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|We were looking for something different for family movie night and found it in ParaNorman.  We enjoyed this movie (sons 7yo, 9yo, hubby, and me) and were surprised at how fun it was.  This might be too scary for younger kids, though, there are some scenes that can be frightening.  There are some places where it lagged, overall though, it was cute with an interesting theme.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It's ok, but not great. Not as good as the first three. Confusing at the beginning. Probably better on big screen (not laptop).
B0058VW36U|5.0|Runs great on my android tablet. Had to have my daughter help me to download it on my tablet. Quite addictive, but so much fun!!!
B00APUYN0I|1.0|I did not want to see this movie; my wife made me.<br />She was disappointed also.<br />The trailer is NOTHING like the film.<br />Adam DeVine was the only bright spot and they got rid of him in the first half of the film<br />This is not a musical nor a comedy
B007VUA7VO|5.0|One of the (very few) less-than-positive attributes of the Kindle Fire HD that I've found over the past few months is its lack of an easily accessible battery level indicator. A user of the Kindle Fire HD \\"out of the box\\" must go through three sub-levels of the drop-down menu in order to determine whether or not the device's battery needs to be charged.<br /><br />\\"Battery HD\\" is a small, unobtrusive, and elegant app that quickly and easily solves this problem. Once installed, \\"Battery HD\\" monitors every aspect of the Kindle Fire HD's battery, putting battery's charge level, charge and discharge rates, and temperature, along with other essential information right at the user's fingertips. A quick swipe of the drop-down menu reveals an easy-to-read icon showing the battery's charge level.<br /><br />The app's strongest feature is that it turns itself on automatically when the device is plugged in and charging, and turns itself off again when the device is unplugged. A very convenient feature indeed!<br /><br />\\"Battery HD\\" works just as well on Android-based smart phones as it does on the Kindle Fire HD; I now have it installed on my phone, where I get the same great results.<br /><br />\\"Battery HD\\" is a very well designed app that's absolutely essential for both the Kindle Fire HD and Android-based smart phones. Highly recommended!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|G5 has been coming out with some interesting storylines lately and this is no different. Not overly long, but lots of fun.

B008M36ER0|5.0|Are Mexican prisons really this way? I guess I don't want to find out. Loved this movie, as a bonus, I believe it was free with Prime membership.
1449433251|5.0|My grandson absoutly loved getting the Complete set of Calvin and Hobbs in the case. It replaced all the smaller books that were scattered all over the place.The set arrived on time. They were in good condition-- no bent corners or rips. I plan on ordering another set for my other grandson.
B008M34INW|3.0|The movie story line was very good.  I had trouble understanding some of the dialog. A lot of the movie dialog is in Mexican (spanish) and that is all right but the subtitling was small and weak in color and all that made it hard to read, other than the weak subtitles I enjoyed the movie a lot even at 3:00am, i did not sleep,The movie kept me awake.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This had a fun plot and I liked that the author didn't make the lead character an idiot. I enjoyed it!
B004K8WJ5C|5.0|bought this for my brother's Christmas present.  i enjoyed it as much as he.  so much music going on that you just don't get in a digital format!  great buy.

B0034G4OYK|1.0|I have 4 year old twins and I went to the movie theater around Halloween to see this movie. Not only was I completely bored but so were my 4 year olds. We all are not that fussy - we loved Frankenweenie, Brave, Monsters which also have seen in tbe past year. But, this one was terrible. Plot was weak and it went on forever. I am a big Adam Sandler fan but this STUNK! Don't waste your money. It's the kind of DVD that ends up at the Salvation Army.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This was a gift for my 7yr old grandson. He was having to watching from a recording on the DVR. But, now he can take it to his room and watch it and not be bothered! He was thrilled to say the least!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Really great movie. Sparky is cute as can be and Igor steals the show. A real winner. Beautiful. Even the texture of the clothing the characters are wearing is interesting. Beware of the ending though for really young kids.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great app with many good sound selections.  I give it a 5 star rating but the only thing missing, in my opinion, is that there is no sleep timer.  Some of the other apps have one.  Still, I highly recommend this app!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love Christian Grey..  wish he was real.  To bad there was not more books in this series.  Still on this book, hope to find they had a family, but like all good novels, the author will probably leave us hanging

B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was great .This book was great because it was a bit of a mystery ,then it was like a thriller.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the layouts and look of this app. Some of the other mahjong games bore me quickly. I keep coming back to this one. My new favorite!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so full of surprises it never gets boring. When the characters are happy, your happy. When someone gets killed or something tragic happens, you want to cry. I've stayed up till two in the morning not wanting to put the book down because  I feel like the hunger games are really happening and I might miss something!!
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I received this album for Christmas and can't stop listening to it. There are just some really, really intriguing and interesting beats here that you just don't find in most other popular music, even previously be Dr. John. The first track, for example - they don't accent the \\"1\\" and the beat is just killing. The guitar playing is great also. It really adds to it - that old Fender-y sound is just great with DJ's piano/organ.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't get enough!  Perfect show for our Binge TV habit.  Characters are great in this real life dramatization of what's happening in our country.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|heavy riffs and great lyrics..he is still on top!!! every song tells me of a story of the intense music ability of this man.
1439192812|2.0|Reading the existing reviews I notice there is often a disagreement between those who are religious and those who are not. I will have nothing to say in that area, and am respectful of what somebody believes or does not believe. My concern is about the science...and how successfully the book describes the scientific method, and what science can say about Dawkins' topic of reality and truth.  That is in fact the reason I felt compelled to write this review. I take issue with Dawkins' explanation of the scientific method. In this regard, I urge the reader and parents in particular, in addition to Dawkins' very fine books, to consider the popular works of Richard Feynman. I know of no finer expositor of what science is and does and certainly few have equaled his deep physical understanding.  Feynman's \\" The Character of Physical Law\\"  (available in inexpensive book form on Amazon, or in a video on the web) -- which is on a level accessible to the general public -- so impressed Bill Gates that when he finally discovered it a few years ago, he purchased the rights to it and made it freely available on the web (project Tuva).<br /><br />  Before getting into the details of the review there is one error that I cannot leave uncorrected. On page 15, Dawkins states that atoms have always existed. While this error is partially corrected later when he discusses the formation of new  and heavier elements in stars and  supernovae, according to the standard Big Bang model, the very early universe was simply too hot for atoms to form.  Therefore, we believe atoms have not always existed - at least according to our current best model. This idea is not difficult and so could be included in the book.  Indeed, Weinberg mentioned this last century in his book for the lay public, \\"The First Three Minutes\\", which I can speculate explains why Dawkins' book is graced with an unequivocal recommendation from Krauss rather than Weinberg.<br /><br />  The first thing a scientist reading Dawkins might object to is Dawkins' title and the words \\"really true\\".  Socrates stated the only thing he knew is that he didn't know anything. Einstein stated those who claimed to know the truth are shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods. But Dawkins claims to know how to tell what is \\"really true\\". In general, Dawkins' statement is not representative of a typical scientific statement.  Scientific \\"truths\\" are of necessity tentative because they are extrapolated based on our experience (known a posteriori) and the possibility of discovering a new fact tomorrow that overturns today's theories is always present.  Dawkins' \\"really true\\" does not quite capture this idea.<br /><br />  This tentative nature of science was highlighted recently by the voluntarily resignation of Ivar Giaever, Nobel Laureate physics, from the American Physical Society (APS).  The APS had issued a statement on global warming, that \\"the evidence is incontrovertible\\",  and Glaever objected to the word incontrovertible.  Now I am not arguing either for or against global warming. I am stating that the language that a scientist, like Dawkins, uses to communicate with the public needs to accurately reflect what we think we know, and the degree of uncertainty of that knowledge. Personal and political agendas cannot be motivations to overstate a position beyond what the evidence and the associated uncertainty of this evidence allows.<br /><br />  The phrase \\"Really true\\" has another problem, as the addition of \\"really\\" is, to a logician, meaningless. Dispense with it. Is the negation of something that is \\"really true\\"  \\"really false\\"?  Dawkins should model the standard use of scientific language to students, not invent his own.<br /><br />  Moving on from the title, Dawkins begins by defining what he means by \\"reality\\" - reality is everything that exists. Dawkins admits that emotions are real, but qualifies this by stating they are contingent on brains.  Dawkins arbitrarily omits mathematics in his list ofwhat is real. This is an unfortunate omission, as perhaps the only truths that we know exactly are mathematical truths. They are known a priori, and do not require the existence of brains. It would not matter if sentient life ever existed, that would not alter the fact that 1 + 1 =2. The omission of mathematics is egregious if one realizes that the \\"magic\\" Dawkins is talking about is \\"poetic magic\\", rather than supernatural magic, because mathematics rates high in \\"poetic magic\\". To quote Bertrand Russell: \\"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty -a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.\\"<br /><br />  Next, we come to Dawkins' explanation of how we know what is real: `We come to know what is real, then, in one of three ways. We can detect it directly, using our five senses; or indirectly, using our senses aided by special instruments such as telescopes and microscopes; or even more indirectly, by creating models of what might be real and then testing those models to see whether they successfully predict things that we can see (or hear, etc.), with or without the aid of instruments.' - (Dawkins, MOR, page 18)<br /><br />  There are problems caused by Dawkins' definition.  The first is minor, but it should be made explicit.  There is no reason to believe that humans, as a species, are intelligent enough to discover all that is real, or exists. Our senses are limited, our ability to perform experiments is limited, our mathematical models are idealizations, and our intelligence is finite, and so it is rather anthropic to claim to know what is \\"really true\\". Another, and more fundamental problem, is Dawkins' description of models in science. There is, in fact, nothing in the scientific method that says our models have to reflect reality. The main requirement is that the model's predictions agree with experiment. Yes, Dawkins example of the discovery of DNA was a triumph for biology, but to generalize the success of biological models to the atomic and subatomic domain, and indeed to all of science, is not justified. You are allowed to assume anything you want in your models, as long as the predictions agree with experiment, and ideally, your model should predict something new that was previously unknown. As Feynman says in \\"The Character of Physical Law\\", you can have as much junk in your model as you like. The idea is to make progress, to advance our knowledge.<br /><br />  The target audience of Dawkins' book is younger readers. Most of the Amazon reviews have been by adults, but I did read a kids review (age 7) in the January 9, 2012 issue of Chemical & Engineering News that expressed a disinterest in the myths that Dawkins insists on presenting in every chapter.  I suspect many kids will likewise be bored by the myths...just show them the science, which after all is the main thing. I own a rather extensive library of books on the physical sciences, but do not own even one book on mythology since to understand science, it is not needed. The inclusion of myths in every chapter by Dawkins is arbitrary. However, if one insists on constantly mentioning myths in every chapter, but one is not willing to discuss the positive benefits of these myths (assuming there are positive benefits) and only ridicules them, then it seems to me you are not showing a scientific objectivity. You are demonstrating a bias. That is not a scientific attitude and it is not one that should be modeled to students. However, it is possible for a scientist to legitimately discuss mythology in his work. A beautiful example is the work of B.F. Skinner in psychology, in his discussion of the causes of human behavior. Skinner noted that progress in physics occurred with the abandonment of the notion, held by the Greeks, that Greek Gods could take possession of an object. When physics began to consider that causes were external to an object, and not internal, such as a Greek God that had temporarily taken up residence inside the object, only then did physics progress.  And so, Skinner argued, that one of the reasons progress in understanding human behavior has been difficult is we have models that, analogous to the Greek Gods, attributed causes of human behavior to an internal indwelling agent...such as an ego, superego, and id. And Skinner suggested that psychology should follow the lead of physics, that to understand human behavior, look at the relation between human behaviors and the external environment, rather than internal characteristics like feelings, personality, and states of mind. That to me is an excellent use of mythology in the context of science. To indicate how mythological models have tended to hinder scientific progress, and rather than ridicule a belief in mythology, instead to see if there is anything we may learn, so that maybe the failures can help us progress. But it is a point that only needs to be made once - if it is in fact ever made -- and not repeated in every chapter.<br /><br />  On page 239, Dawkins makes the statement: \\"People who would laugh at the idea that a pumpkin could turn into a coach, and who know perfectly well that silk handkerchiefs don't really turn into rabbits, are quite happy to believe that a prophet turned water into wine or, as devotees of another religion would have it, flew to heaven on a winged horse.\\"  As I said, I have nothing to offer on what religious ideas a person choses to believe or not, only on what science can say. But Dawkins has switched gears here, to the consideration of human beliefs. Dawkins is stating it is silly to believe things that are not true. This is not a scientific attitude. The idea in science is to suspend judgment, to take a look at the idea, in this case, humans holding false beliefs, and test it. When you do that, when you maintain the attitude of a scientist, you discover a surprising thing about humans -- that beliefs that are false can be beneficial. I don't play golf, but my understanding is that a sports psychologist might very well instruct a golfer seeking to improve his game to not only visualize himself shooting a 70, but instruct him to say things that are false, affirmations like \\"I shoot a 70 golf game\\". An utterly false statement and belief, yet a very useful tool to have at ones disposal if the goal is to improve one's game. Similarly, one may look at Alcoholics Anonymous use of a \\"higher power\\". The question is not is the existence of a higher power true. Human belief can be a tool. You don't ask if your car is true. It is a tool that allows you to travel faster and easier than without it. To ask if a car is true is not a useful question, and so it is with the AA higher power. The question to ask of a tool is does it work, and is it ecological?  It is not enough that the belief helps one attain a goal, it should also not have any unwanted consequences. Now I understand this idea of the utility of false beliefs is not news to Dawkins, since it has been studied from an evolutionary view.  And it's not news to Doctors who understand the placebo effect. So I think on the topic of belief and truth, which includes religious belief, Dawkins has omitted ideas that could be profitably explained to students.<br /><br />  And finally, we come to Dawkins' actual presentation of science. On the whole, Dawkins' explanations are satisfactory. There are trivial technical issues, but they are not critical.<br />I might not use the metaphor of \\"soldiers on parade\\" to describe crystals. Soldiers on parade march around the field, break off into groups, and do a variety of things not seen in acrystal lattice. Crystals are rigid. The ions are fixed in the lattice, and do not march. I bought Dawkins' book twice. First I bought the kindle version, which has no diagrams. When I read about the \\"soldiers on parade\\" I thought he must be trying to describe a primitive cell of the crystal, and so he must have a diagram or something to illustrate this metaphor, so I ordered the book. No, no soldiers on parade illustration in the book either. And there is no mention of quasicrystals, so perhaps a discussion of crystals is really too advanced of a subject for this level. A simple discussion of the three states of matter -- solid, liquids, and gasses -- is perhaps all that is needed.<br />And if one is going to discuss stars, supernovae, and the mass of atoms, electrons, and protons, then perhaps the equivalence of mass and energy, and E=MC2, could be profitably mentioned. But still, I think Dawkins' has done ok on this part, in his discussion of actual science.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, despite the many fine qualities of the book, such as I just mentioned his actual explanation of a few of our scientific theories, in my opinion the good is overshadowed by the questionable aspects. So I would recommend Feynman first, to lay a proper foundation on the scientific method and then Dawkins as a supplement, particularly for Dawkins' explanation of evolution.ner in psychology, in his discussion of the causes of human behavior. Skinner noted that progress in physics occurred with the abandonment of the notion, held by the Greeks, that Greek Gods could take possession of an object. When physics began to consider that causes were external to an object, and not internal, such as a Greek God that had temporarily taken up residence inside the object, only then did physics progress.  And so, Skinner argued, that one of the reasons progress in understanding human behavior has been difficult is we have models that, analogous to the Greek Gods, attributed causes of human behavior to an internal indwelling agent...such as an ego, superego, and id.

I bought Dawkins' book twice. First I bought the kindle version, which has no diagrams. When I read about the \\"soldiers on parade\\" I thought he must be trying to describe a primitive cell of the crystal, and so he must have a diagram or something to illustrate this metaphor, so I ordered the book. No, no soldiers on parade illustration in the book either. And there is no mention of quasicrystals, so perhaps a discussion of crystals is really too advanced of a subject for this level. A simple discussion of the three states of matter -- solid, liquids, and gasses -- is perhaps all that is needed.<br />And if one is going to discuss stars, supernovae, and the mass of atoms, electrons, and protons, then perhaps the equivalence of mass and energy, and E=MC2, could be profitably mentioned. But still, I think Dawkins' has done ok on this part, in his discussion of actual science.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, despite the many fine qualities of the book, such as I just mentioned his actual explanation of a few of our scientific theories, in my opinion the good is overshadowed by the questionable aspects. So I would recommend Feynman first, to lay a proper foundation on the scientific method and then Dawkins as a supplement, particularly for Dawkins' explanation of evolution.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting novel about (corporate?) greed and the cyclical effect of intrusive government abuse on its citizens. Worth the quick read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Hard to believe this show has been on for 8 years.  Just stumbled onto it two or three months ago.  Have watched every episode since then via Netflix and Amazon. Love it.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Very good clarity and was a fun movie to watch with good story line. I would definitely buy it again.
B004SIP8OI|2.0|\\"Why am I watching this?\\"  That's never a good sign, when you ask yourself that 20 minutes into a movie.  What we have here is plenty of bloody action, but no plot, and intentionally poor dialogue.  Artfully staged mortal combats, but no reason to care about the main character.  Sure, she was shot in the head on her wedding day.  But why?  And by whom?  Who is she anyway?  Why should I even care?  And then I find out I need to sit through a second movie just to find out why?  Are you kidding me?  It was all I could do to get through this one.  Pulp Fiction this is not.  Unfortunately.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Where to begin ?<br /><br />If you enjoy poorly constructed characters engaged in meaningless acts, then this 3-Hour turkey will delight you.<br /><br />Others - stay away.<br /><br />BATMAN: The Batman of the Dark Knight was something to behold - a hero so overwhelming that even vigilantes in that film were yearning to follow in his footsteps. This Batman hobbles around for nearly the entire film. He's slow, dim, unexciting in every way. Dull as Dishwater.<br /><br />BANE: What a backstory - NOT. So his mother and he were thrown into some third world prison. Ok. So what does he do when he escapes ? Rescue his mom ? Take revenge on the goverment that incarcerated him ? No. He wants to kill everyone in New York City - err - Gotham. And kill himself in the process. Sure.<br /><br />Now right off the bat I can think of at least two American hellholes, that if Bane targeted them, I might be cheering him on. But NYC ? Again ?<br /><br />And how come no one ever targets Bane's lame mask ? Does it ever occur to Batman that if he tears it off, Bane dies ? Oh wait, Batman can't deliverately kill anyone. Sigh. Where's the Punisher when you need him !<br /><br />CATWOMAN: Anne Hathaway is easy on the eyes, no doubt. But is she even CatWoman ? Julie Newmar had the claws, the curves, the purrs and the hisses. And sported a pair of perfectly formed - um - EARS. Yes, a beautiful pair that no man can take his eyes off of. Quite a gal.<br /><br />Anne could have been great if the writers gave her a chance. But no. For starters her motivation is she wants to clear her criminal record ? Really. So she commits MORE crimes ! THe first rule of getting yourself out of a hole is QUIT DIGGING !<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Does Bane even die ? The villian is supposed to go down after a ferocious battle. Instead we're supposed to believe a single gunshot did the trick ?<br /><br />And the final scene - why did they even film it ? They could have just spliced in the final minutes from Angels and Demons.<br /><br />Worst - Batman - Film - Ever.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|This show is one of the best and recommend it to everyone. So excited to have gotten this season on sale!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was so much fun to play. I found myself sitting for hours playing this game. Definitely worth my money!!!

B0007TKNL0|5.0|This was a gift and was loved so much, she cried over it.  It has wonderful clarity.  Thank you so much!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|A wonderful book writen in the authors own hand. Having followed the WHO since attending the famous &#34;fire&#34; concert at the Filmore East this book makes clear what Townshend and the Who were all about. Reccomend highly.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|It always is more impressive on the big screen, but since the whole family loves the twilight saga we enjoyed it very much to refresh the memory before going to see the last part.
0451232852|5.0|This book is amazing.  I've noticed some of the other reviewers commenting on the unlikely coincidences in this book (war torn lovers reunite, a Russian exile is sent home and meets his brother), but this book is truly phenomenal. I couldn't put it down and immediately read it's sequel and am now anxiously awaiting the final book!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I got the app and tried several times to get it to load.  One time it almost did, but then shut down.  I just dumped it.  I don't need anything that hard to get to work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|almost to the end and the update erased. my progress. good. game otherwise. I share this game with the grandkids
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Just as addicting as the first 4; sad to have to wait for the next!  Not disappointed at all!  Glad I purchased regardless of the negative reviews!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. It was a good book, I definitely recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was a great book from start to finish. I really loved Sky's character and imagined everything from her point of view. At the beginning of the book I never would have imagined it was gonna end the way it did. I definitely couldn't stop reading until the very end. Best book I've read in a long time!!!!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|movie is great. good movie. me like movie. buy movie and watch with friend. happy movie friend night. two more words required.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really think that this app is wonderful. Easy to use. Very useful.5 stars!!!<br /><br />It is really great at estimating battery life for different types of use. I would highly recommend this app.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app. Love to play this. Never any glitches. This has been on my phone and my kindle fire since day one.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I have never been disappointed with any of Susan's DVDs. She has amazing talent. I am so glad that she was discovered!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|They have watched it several times since receiving it for a Christmas gift.  It is a good movie for kids.
B00992CF6W|4.0|good app I love it but how do u blow up Tnt in creative mode? on the next update thar should be included
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just have finished the book and I am crying. I highly recommend this if you want an emotional love story that you will never lose interest in.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very touching, sweet and thoroughly thought provoking. A masterfully written piece of literature. I'd easily recommend this book to anyone.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Wonderful game for all ages. When I first got it,  I was worried it was a waste but I was wrong!!! It's addicting and super fun. LOVE THOSE CUTE LITTLE PUDDING MONSTERS!!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Worked okay at first. Now I get an error message, and it won't work. Disappointing that I had to pay to &quot;unlock&quot; the camera. Really? Probably unstable because I changed the pixels. I found out that was a problem after the fact. If it becomes unstable when you change the pixels, then why give the option? Spent the money on the app, which now doesn't work. I went through the process of their &quot;fix,&quot; and that didn't work. Now what can I do? I would like to delete the app and start over, but I can't do that without paying again. Sheesh!
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Good stuff, does it's job like it's supposed to.  Hard to say much about PC components but I've had no problems. Recommended.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|After reading Pride and Prejudice and seeing the Colin Firth version, I was hesitant to watch the movie, but decided to try since I like Keira Knightly's acting.<br /><br />The movie stays fairly true to the book, and is so beautiful. The costumes and settings are breath taking, and add a whole new wonder to the already amazing story.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game looks boring.  The box is boring.  Setting it up is boring.  While reading the instructions, looking at the board, and trying to convince my family to give it a shot, I was almost convinced myself just to give up and consider it a waste of money.  But despite every groan while I read yet another rule, all my family was addicted within just a few games.  It's a very fun strategy game - a mix of Risk and Monopoly.<br /><br />Basically, if you like Risk but don't like the fights it inevitably causes, this game is for you.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I recently heard an interview with one of the head writers at ABC family, during which she explained that their shows are designed to appeal to 15-35 year old woman. Being a 24 year old woman, I decided to watch Pretty Little Liars, and see if I agreed with the interview.<br /><br />I did not expect to enjoy the show, I mean it is about high school girls, and I am out of college and have a job. But the writers and producers know their audience, and the show wrapped me in during the first episode. The show is delightful.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|we had of course seen the old total recall... and had heard mixed revews for this one... but it was really good..
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This is a fun movie but pretty formulaic movie with no suspense. It does entertain and the singing is very good.
B0086700CM|5.0|Me and my brother love it and it is almost the same as brave.It is a nice game because there is no pop ups and dose not take long to lode. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I watched it The movie is very good to watch the 3 movie pack is a good deal i love it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|okay so some people might think it is to hard (if to jaard go online to cheat :) but once you get the hang of it you'll love itttttttttt
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Cute childrens movie with a good message and on the advice of a 15 y.o. decided to watch it.  Animation was great
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was the first Vince Flynn book I read but it won't be my last one.  It really had some surprising twists to it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a fast Bible data base and there are several versions.<br />I use this for all quick referances and I use to use it is church but it appeared that I was not paying attention.
0767802519|5.0|Thanks for the great deal and the quick, fast shipment. The item arrived, gently used and all in tact. It was great doing business with you.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|Joseph Gordon Leavitt is great in this film as he fights for his life in the present while his older self played by Bruce Willis fights for his life in the future. Great action and superb acting this is fun sci-fi action fare!
0545265355|4.0|I loved the first book and the second one was good also. Third is not as great but still a good read. My older kids have also enjoyed reading them. They have a good message but are very violent.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I am so happy Cooking Dash is on Kindle Fire! I like the bigger format and I didn't have to pay hundreds more for an IPad just to play my Dash games.I will feel complete when Wedding Dash comes out!
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|I love this series, but they have finally hit the wall.  This movie was almost unwatchable for me, and I consider myself a fan of the series and genre.  Sad day for me after watching this one.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Kindle will not stand up.  It slides down.  Strips not tacky enough to hold it upright.  I had to put a thick rubber band around cover to keep Kindle from sliding down.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This was a Christmas present to someone in the family. It arrived in great shape. Family member was very excited to receive this.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|How could any Conan Doyle reader give this collection less than five stars?<br /><br />When I was a teenager, I think I read every Sherlock Holmes story. But when I came to the last one, it was a sad day. I wanted more.<br /><br />So the great stories remain the same, but now it's on my e-book reader and I can carry them with me and re-read them any time I want to. It's easy to deduce five stars. In fact, it's elementary.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|Not really free game continued to fail to work correctly. Graphics are great but really would like for game work correctly and be upfront on price. Don't think I will try any of their other games buyer beware.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|Iwas excited to get this game but unfortunately it began to crash after a few minutes of play. Everytime I select a game the app shuts down... I'm uninstalling...
030758836X|1.0|This book started off interesting, but ended up crashing and burning into one of the worst plot endings I've ever read. I only kept reading to see just how \\"Amazing\\" Amy would get her just deserts after her years of manipulation, deceit, and pure evilness. But, alas, the joke was on me! The ending of this story left me flabbergasted and not in a good way, which is too bad because this book had a lot of potential.<br /><br />I will not reveal any spoilers, but I will say some of the plot twists, especially the ending, were ludicrous, ridiculous, absurd, etc..... Overall, I was underwhelmed, let down, and left feeling disgusted and irritated. Similar to feeling like I found a bug in my food. Just repulsed...<br /><br />Helpful hint: If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend or check it out from your local library, like I did. It's not worth purchasing in my opinion.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great, sometimes frustrating game, where you try to get your opponent (in this case pigs) by diving bombing them! The game gets progressively harder as you finish each level.  A great stress relieving game!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just when you think you got it.....bam!  You need to take your time and think some of them through. Makes you use your brain:)
0393314804|1.0|...but I have no idea if this is a good story because I became bored and frustrated trying to translate the cockney crap. Forget the book, go see the movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I fell in love with this book and with Charlie, it reminded me of so many of the awkward feelings you have in high school. First love, discovery of who you are and how you fit in this world. Charlie comes to discover things about his past but didn't let it define him which is why I loved this coming of age story. I would defiantly recommend. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I was a little disappointed that we never really find out who  is \\"friend\\" .
B008NR8YTQ|2.0|Bad recording and not Gary's best work. God rest his soul. There are many, many recordings that showcase Gary's genius - this ain't one of em.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I was looking for some apps to kill time over break and found this. I assumed it would be a zynga game, which it somewhat is, but was proven wrong. You can pay but it only takes a short time unlike farmville for getting stuff. I love this game! See, unlike what the top rate  review says, you can get diamonds without paying. I have about 20 diamonds and haven't paid a penny even though I've only had the game since yesterday. I only give it 4 because of the pay to win feature.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was well written and entrancing to say the least. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a taste for conspiracies, treason, and sacrifice.
0374275637|5.0|Statistics can be utilized for a number of applications in modern society; defrauding retirement accounts, creating health scares, and political mischief. That is why Daniel Kahneman is an interesting author, using his training to explain why the human brain has problems with statistical thinking. He presents himself as his first example of the fallibility of the human brain regarding statistics. He eagerly admits that despite his statistical training he failed to apply statistics and probabilities in a useful manner during everyday situations. However, instead of sweeping the problem under a tenured position, he decided to isolate why the brain cannot easily think in statistical terms.<br /><br />It needs to be remembered that this book covers nearly fifty years of work, this is not a pop-science book but a detailed review of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work. Perhaps this is the single greatest book available regarding the limits of the brain. In fact, the book goes beyond limitations and explains how amazing the brain is, but, humans have created a society that often shortcuts our natural cognitive abilities. Trying to understand things are brains cannot understand is a genuinely honorable pursuit, and Kahneman has created a wonderful foundation for all of us to build upon.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone, even if they do not understand it at first. Over time the lessons present themselves in the real world, you start to use the tools Kahneman suggests in the book. We cannot help that our brains are not evolved for modernity, but we can recognize the limits of our abilities, and not become a turkey. This book truly makes us question ourselves, and society.
B008H08XW2|4.0|Every Maroon 5 album is slightly different and has its own unique sound. Their first album is heavily influenced by rock and jazz, the second has more of a techno sound, and the third takes a softer, mellower approach to many of the songs. Overexposed, Maroon 5's latest album released on June 26th, 2012, is the band's \\"poppiest\\" set to date. It adheres to more mainstream tastes, much to the chagrin of many, including myself. While I do love this album there are times when myself and others wish that Maroon 5 would go back to its roots and make music that sounds more like their classic rock, ala \\"Harder to Breathe,\\" or jazz, ala \\"Sunday Morning.\\" Both of those songs were and still are wildly popular in various circles. Success like those songs are what first brought Maroon 5 into the public eye over 10 years ago; why not follow a tried and true formula? Nevertheless, \\"Overexposed\\" is still a solid album with several really interesting tracks.<br /> \\"Overexposed\\" manages to cover a lot of ground in its sound. While the basis of every song is pop, songs like \\"Wasted Years\\" have a much older feel to them than the rest of the contemporary feeling album. \\"Lucky Strike\\" is a fast paced and high energy song that contrasts greatly with a track like \\"Sad\\" which is, quite obviously, a sad, slow song. Akin to \\"Sad\\" is \\"Beautiful Goodbye,\\" one of the only other somber songs. I'll admit that a few of the songs stump me as to their meanings, such as \\"Ladykiller.\\" For the life of me I can't figure out whose point of view the song is from. Others I don't particularly have a taste for but that's just my personal opinion, and I don't want to influence anyone else with those. Some random trivia: the album was actually named for the front man Adam Levine's overexposure in the public eye recently. Of course in my mind there is absolutely no problem with a little more Adam Levine in the world.
0807014273|4.0|The book was selected because of its listing in &#34;must read&#34; books. It is in fact two books with the first being his Concentration Camp survival story and the second about Logotherapy. The former is an incredible story of survival with perhaps a significant amount of sheer luck. What shocked me was the manipulation aspects of controlling prisoners by their own and the absolute lack of respect for life. I could not help thinking that many unpalatable incidents were left out of the book. I was not disappointed in the author's desire to show that survival was closely linked to having a meaning in life or positive attitude. Frankl did not wallow in pity, bitterness and was factual in his account during those dark years.<br />The Logotherapy analysis did use jargon and technical terms. However, I was impressed with the argument of not digging into the past to solve all problems. More could have been done to highlight differences to Freud and Adler. Selected case studies did help.<br />For any person wallowing in self-pity this book is a must read. It does add a great deal to the field of 'self-help' literature and a glimpse into the ability of a human being to survive atrocious conditions.
B007MDQW3C|5.0|Nowadays it seems like music sounds too refined, there's just not enough emotion which is what makes great music great. Most of the music I hear on the radio sounds like the same song over and over. That might be good enough for the casual listener, but not for me. I crave sustenance with my music and with Regina Spektor you get it! She has a unique sound and a beautiful voice. Her earlier music is mostly just her and her piano, which is fantastic, but now she seems to be taking it to the next level. She is including more instruments and even other singers. Some people don't like the change, but I for one love it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I choose this app, because I like to keep up with the weather.  It is also easy for me to check on my Kindle Fire HD.  I like that it shows the present temperature where you are at the time, when you put your zip code location in.  I have really enjoyed this app.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|though it is similar to the glee show we loved it and watched it twice.It is a great movie where the popular girl doesnt always win.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I choose this app, because I think that it is a good search engine.  I really do like google and I would recommend it to my friends for their different tables.
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|I actually bought this CD for my 25 year old daughter for Christmas.  She likes the oldies for some reason. She was happy with it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|The Oxford dictionary of English is good because if you have it when you go to a place and you have to look up something you can use this  to look up your information  you can find it easily
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great unexpected twists and turns. I fall in love with these two and their relationship more and more by the chapter!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. This book caught me by surprise, and I especially loved the ending.  He showed her friends!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is so much fun and i love the graphics! Addicting!!!!! The safari part is my favorite! getting to go rescue the animals is fun. i cant wait to keep going!
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids and I enjoy playing this game. We can't  get enough of this game. It's full of vibrant colors.
B005THRU0C|5.0|Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.  We used it already and recommend it to others. My daughter loves to sing along to this CD
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My family and I love playing angry birds. I like  the variety of choses the game has and different levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its cool and fun to play with my friends and family when we are bored at home on weekends and thankyou
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I saved the penguins 4 times but the game would not let me advance to the next trial. The levels I tried were okay but its not work the storage.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|The free dictionary has more to offer than just a simple dictionary. It also acts like an encyclopedia ad is easy to use. I recommend it for anyone.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed the singing in this movie.  There were some really great moments, musically.  The story line is geared toward high school and college-aged persons, but I thoroughly enjoyed it (I'm quite a bit older!).  It had some corny moments, some predictable moments, but overall, an interesting movie. I would recommend it.
098357670X|5.0|As an artist and cartoonist I can say this is one of the best books on the subject of caricature and the instructions are well written and informative. A great window into the world of a cartoonist.
B004GYY714|5.0|I loaded this app based on it's great reviews and I am so thrilled with it, I can barely articulate my elation.  I live VERY rurally and can literally only get one or two country music stations on a radio - NOT something I would ever wish to listen to.  In my car, the radio reception is not a lot better.  I particularly enjoy talk radio and this app gives it to me in an abundance I had never imagined would be possible where I live.  Sound quality (with and without my cheap earphones) is perfect and it's no exaggeration to say that this app has changed my life.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Little did my wife suspect she was unleashing a flock of angry birds and hiding &#34;pre-bacon&#34; targets when she got me that Kindle for Christmas.
B001BR3P0S|5.0|This is one of those cult classic films from the 80's that has a great storyline and message for the masses of the time! Great lessons to be learned from the film and at the same time is entertaining! I could watch this movie over and over again. Even my own children (teen) have seen the film and liked it so it is a multi generational classic!
B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|I liked this product because the movie is fantastic the problem i was annoyed at is the digital copy :(<br />i bought i because it had the digital copy but when i went to put the code in it said this digital copy does not work in your region (which sucks because I thought all digital copies work worldwide, but i supposedly doesn't)<br /><br />If I had known that I wouldn't of paid the amount i did.<br />So I am very disappointed but the movie is still ok I guess
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I've ever read! The story line is great! Katniss is my favorite character! She's a fighter. Love her
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game uses simple, hand drawn graphics to create a fun environment that's appropriate for all ages. The puzzles in each level, and hidden items, are clever and entertaining enough to give this game great playability and re-playability. Overall a very good game worth every penny.
B009AMANBA|5.0|As a Spielberg production, \\"Lincoln\\" is often a highly manipulative tearjerker, but it can at times also be an intelligent, thoughtful, and complex work.  The movie is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals,\\" but I think the script owes more to Robert Caro's Lyndon Baines Johnson biography.  In \\"Master of the Senate,\\" Caro reveals Johnson as the master prevaricator and vote counter, knowing exactly how many votes he needed to pass the bill, which Senator was voting which position, and if and how the Senator's position could be switched.  Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" very much follows the same lines -- how Lincoln would ultimately pass the 13th amendment through manipulation, bribery, compromise, procrastination, and ultimately prevarication.<br /><br />It's the first week of Lincoln's second term, which he has won by an overwhelming majority, and he is determined to use his power and his popularity to pass the 13th amendment, which would strike the right to own slaves from the Constitution forever.  Lincoln feels urgency for two reasons.  First, the North is soon about to overwhelm the South, and if that were to happen whatever popular support for the 13th amendment would vanish with the winning of the war.  Second, Lincoln, as a lawyer, knows that his Emancipation Proclamation is filled with legal contradictions that a Supreme Court, no longer afraid of a wartime president, would strike down immediately.  To pass the 13th amendment, Lincoln must use all the immense power and popularity he has amassed for himself, and the entire movie offers a clinical study of how Lincoln would manipulate his wife, his most trusted subordinate (Secretary of State Seward), the different factions of his own Republican Party, and Democratic congressmen with a conscience to pass the 13th amendment.  That Spielberg could fill such a legislative triumph with high melodrama is a testament to his film-making prowess.<br /><br />Ultimately, what makes \\"Lincoln\\" so compelling to watch is Daniel Day-Lewis' precise portrayal.  Day-Lewis imbues his Lincoln persona with authority and compassion, but also grace and elegance, and it's simply a delight to watch Day-Lewis onscreen.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I play this game on facebook and cannot access the game I have already been playing for a long time.  would be nice if I could play the one game.  it gets better the harder the rooms.
1451695195|5.0|Whow can Christians believe in a holy God. A God who makes a difference between good and bad! We need a God who enjoyes atrocities done to millions of little children and women; Beaten and abused, tortured and killed.<br />Hitler and his SS-troups are the good God given excample for this world and the only true futur and eternity. That's what E. Alexanders book is suggesting to everyone by telling \\"There if nothing you can do wrong\\".<br />What a blasphemy in view of all the men made suffering in this world. What a treachery! - My father had a ND-experience, similar to the ND-story of Marvin J. Besteman. \\"My journey to heaven\\". He also stood before the gate to heaven or what's in reallity the forecourt of heaven, where everyone once will be gathered for the final judgement. There, he heared Gods voice, speaking to him, \\"you will never enter heaven, unsless you accept my son Jesus Christ as your Saviour and Lord\\". After 3 days in coma he returned and the first thing he did was giving his heart, his live to Jesus, the true Light. A half year later he went through the gate of heaven to meet his Saviour.<br />St. Paul tells us that we are born with evil already within us and that nothing can clean us and make us pure except Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us, that in the endtime the devil will appear as an angel of light and mislead the people this world. That's what happens through this book, producing a deadly wrong \\"hurrah-felling\\" within thousands of readers.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game! I have played it on my friends kindle. but everytime I try to download it... it always says error can not download.. so can anyone help me?
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's not like the other games and your not timed, which I like! It still challenges you to get five minutes or less on each puzzle.
B004UID2LC|1.0|We want to be able to watch Disney Junior (which you also DON'T HAVE) youtube shows while attending doctors visits and etc..and honestly I'm not sure what this is. Searches bring up videos with half naked woman or cussing and we are looking for kid shows. Please step up your app game. Going to put this Kindle Fire on ebay soon.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|my friend told me about this game but when I got it and typed in my e-mail password it said it was wrong but I think ji know my OWN email password
B00A757EFW|3.0|I'm not going to complain too much about this game because it was free, but I'd probably be pissed if I had paid for it.  Maybe I just suck at Pac-Man (which I kinda do), but I'm not real crazy about it, and probably won't be spending much time on this one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book and as always Grisham keeps you guessing a while.  It is a speed read. The book plays well on the paperwhite
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This guy writes fantastic, innovative, stimulating fiction.  The only other author that moved me so much upon my first \\"discovery\\" was Haruki Murakami.  Seems to be a self published author - the first example I have found of such unsigned talent.  Unless he is a plagiarist and we don't know it yet....
0739384198|5.0|This is one book out of three, I thought they were the best interesting stories I have ever read, I've read them several times and I will not get rid of them they are great.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Thanks to FX I started wathching this addictive series and wanted to see how all the charedcters came to be.
0739384171|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, it was difficult to put it down I would recommend this book , all three stories Are fantastic. I've read them several times.
0439023491|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift. I had already read it, and I loved the book. My niece was very happy.
0553582038|5.0|Another amazing book in the series.  Can't wait for #5 - I will be reading that next.  Hope you enjoy
030758836X|1.0|After hearing several friends reference Gone Girl, I decided to give it a try. I'm so surprised this has been a good seller. The story is absolutely riddled with implausible dialogue, phony-sounding character names, repeated specifics (motes of dust, anyone?). Ugh, it was beyond trite. The scene with the abandoned shopping mall was so silly and contrived I almost had to stop reading. The Amazing Amy children's book series playing so prominently was, time and again, so self-indulgent and implausible. The whole thing was just a complete mess. I also found the language lazy and gross. One of the last lines has the husband feeling sorry for the wife and he explains to her it's \\"because every morning you have to wake up and be you\\". I feel the same for Gillian Flynn! She's somehow convinced a lot of people that this book has some redeeming qualities. It's a sham.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this series. Easy reading! I most definitely recommend this series to everyone of any gage. It is great.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The 25th anniversary to Les Mis was my first introduction to the musical.  And as a lover of all the classic musicals, I'm clueless as to why I knew nothing about Les Mis.  It is now my number one musical on my top ten list.  Every song touches me in someway and hearing Alfie Boe sing &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; is so emotional that the audience has to stand up to show their appreciation even before the end of the show.  Norm Lewis who plays Javert  never verrs from his role of trying to capture Jean Valjean by pulling you in with his stunning rendition of &#34;Stars&#34; . Ramin Karimloo who plays Enjoiras leads his fellow patriots with his powerful tenor voice, as he sings &#34;Red and Black&#34;. Both women Fantine and Eponine have voices that lead you wanting more from them. Matt Lucas  who plays Thenardier brings a lighter side to the musical and makes you want to start dancing with the chorus. Lastly Nick Jonas and  Katie Hall who play Marius and Cosette look well together but it is Nick who at times doesn't come through as a young man madly in love with the beautiful Cosette. I can honestly say I did think Nick pulled off his version of &#34;Empty chairs & Empty tables&#34; but it is Katie's voice that steals the show when the two duet together.  Lastly there are no words to describe the whole cast as they sing &#34;Do You Hear The People Sing&#34; and One Day More. Les Miserables is a Masterpiece.
B000FC1192|2.0|II chose two because it a kids book and I understood the movie better than the book n  teen should read this book
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This fast-paced book provides a great escape that mixes current reality with fiction. As usual, the main hero is bullet-proof.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am really disappointed with this app.  I expected more from Facebook. Just use Dolphin Browser on desktop mode and save yourself some hassle!
0440244870|5.0|I used to be a journalist so I could totally relate to Becky's adventures in the publishing industry. Probably because of that, I also found it hilarious from the beginning to end. I chuckled to myself on many occasions, and if I was not laughing, I was smiling away like crazy. The story flows naturally and quickly, making this one of those books you can read non stop until the end.<br /><br />While the premise for the plot seem simple enough - a girl trying to clear her debt - Sophie Kinsella makes each scene riveting, each character likeable and the protagonist lovable. I also fell in love with Luke Brandon here, the love interest of the story and was surprise to look back and realize how little he features in the book. That shows how well Sophie Kinsella writes her characters - she can make them come alive without needing too many words or scenes.<br /><br />This was my FIRST chick lit and I don't read chick lit often after that, because this book has set the bar so high.<br />If you are new or old to the chick lit genre, this is definitely, possibly the best you can read in the genre!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|The giorlfriend loves the cd, wont stop playing it kinda to much to be honest but she is happy. lol
B005DI9HPI|2.0|I feel bad writing a bad review, but this book bored me so much I stopped reading halfway. It's not a terrible book - it's just a bit outlandish, especially if you have been reading chick lit for a while. I found the fact that the protagonist can up and move to New York and suddenly have male interests popping out everywhere a bit cliched. Maybe I read the book at the wrong time or maybe it was meant to be pure escapism.<br /><br />If you just want to fantasize about living in a new city, going shopping and having male interests, this book will probably fulfill that fantasy. For me, I just didn't relate. Not from the opening wedding moments to her arrival in NY and her progressing love relationship. So I just stopped reading.<br /><br />Again, this might just be me since the book seemed to have garnered enough attention that it spawned sequels. So to each his own.
B003O86FMW|4.0|So hard to put the book down. So many twists and turns. Would recommend to anyone weather a steady reader or not.
B005974C94|5.0|amazing sound<br />amazing songs.<br />love it.  great for road trips.<br />the quality of the sound and the skills of the performers.<br />just amazing.
034580404X|5.0|These books are so captivating! I couldn't put them down! I felt as if I was a part of the whole experience! I recommend as a must read to anyone!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is good.  Fun.  Well done.<br />But, It is annoying to have all the crap at the beginning.  In fact, it is so annoying that I probably won't buy another product.<br />Seriously, 5-7 minutes of stupid stuff.  I have no idea what it is anymore, i just turn the thing on and then leave and go do other stuff.<br /><br />my issue here is -- YES, I bought this and I'm stuck listening to this pre-workout garbage.  I'm stuck.  Captive Audience.<br />BUT, it will preclude me from EVER buying another one of your videos.<br /><br />I'm not angry, just annoyed.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|this dvd set came in mint unopened condition as the description says. and arrived early. get it while you can. this set new will not be available forever!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always good reading and good service in receiving the books and in mint condition all the time. I buy all my books from Amazon.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book. It captured me from the first chapter. It's a great love novel. I recemend this book to anyone who is interested in romance.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is my first g5 game. The free portion intrigued me enough to purchase the full version. I like the map feature which is a hint unto itself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yes there are good books and lots of great book end. But this book in particular surpasses them! Wow wow wow! This book is one you must read. The last book of the hunger games was great but I feel it could have been better but overall amazing trilogy!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This was  a good clean show for the entire family with enough umphf for grown ups. Male and female in our house enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although there was a lot of talking and katness seemed weaker than she normally is I was still moved and I loved it. I was so sad when prim died.. I can't believe she died or finnick ah it's so sad :( but amazing trilogy!
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|Spectacular writing. Simple and fluid. Praises running and life. Every runner should be allowed to reading it. A true masterpiece.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'd read it over and over. Can't wait to read the rest of the books by S Collins! Awesome book and author.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This was a great second part to the series. Amazing scenery and acting. I had never watched any of the movies and I'm wondering what I was thinking then.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The game has an unassuming charm. It has a good blend if cleverness and ease of use. It was brilliant to have us draw our own goofy stick figures and have them be the centerpiece of the story.
B00447G29S|5.0|What has become perhaps the best Christmas movie ever is something to behold in 3D. Really brings to life the characters and a big hit with kids of all ages.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This played from the time I got it till Christmas was over.  LOVE IT.  Really nice songs sound is great.  Enjoyed it very much.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game ha a very interesting storyline.  The objects were hard enough to find but not so difficult that it was frustrating.  There were other things going on as well which made the anecdotes fun.  On casual mode the hints recharged quickly enough when you get stuck. I have a Kindle HD 8 inch and the graphics were excellent!
B000SW4DXK|5.0|A great Holiday story, well cast and very effectively retold with a modern twist.  Still very relevant years after the original.  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
B0058A119G|3.0|I need to contact the sender as there is a flaw in one of the CDs.  I love the  music of the Bergman's.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The ability to see the stories I have read in book form adds a nuance to my pleasure of this genre.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Shipped on time with no damage.<br /><br />Product was as described.<br /><br />I love supporting the BBC.<br /><br />Love the extras as well.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Trouble with the Curve had trouble with acting honestly.  There was nothing stellar about the story or the acting it was just alright.  I wouldn't tell my friends they have to see it.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  She has been dragging it around with all of her Barbie's since.  The zippers are sturdy- not cheap and &#34;sticky&#34;.  Keep in mind that the sides and lid are made of a vinyl material over what I'm assuming is cardboard inside. If a child is rough with their toys, I could see it ripping and being garbage.  It seems durable for average playtime, but, at the same time I can tell it's not intended for rough play.
B00846F1YW|1.0|Don't like it ,  Found it boring  and not my cup of tea. What more can I tell you except that.
B006JSXYPA|2.0|This movie overall was disappointing.  I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D.  This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased.  The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion.
B004SBX112|5.0|This is a very good game .  For me it keeps my mind alert by trying to figure out the angles  you have to let the birds go in order for them to get rid of the pigs.  Ha ha.
1423124960|5.0|This is not a beginner reading book but my 3.5 year old loves it. There are lots of words and yet still lots of pictures and with 300 pages it is a book to add to her collection.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Trailer revealed the best of the movie - it was good enough entertainment, but not a top 5 or 10
B00992CF6W|5.0|I usually play the X-Box edition, but when I do play the pocket edition I will play it for hours at a time! This game is definantly worth the money, and I reccomend it to all the peoples of the world!
B00787IR2Q|4.0|Got to enjoy this movie all over again through the eyes of my 8 year old. She thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of fun.  Couldn't put it down once I got started.  The harder games were very challenging and I had to finish.
B001OMJGD0|1.0|It didn't work, i coudn't see the movie, i tried for more than an hour without luck, I want a refund of my monet.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The Martian was an optimistic portrayal of what could really happen in our efforts to colonize another world. this book offers a Strong scientific lean toward detail. you can actually image the sheer challenge of facing such a dilemma and come to realize the science and engineering of what you will face. was clear and concise. you can actual imagine the integrated systems as they are described. the author does not patronize the reader. unrealistic though some of the challenges and outcomes may be, i was drawn into the martian because in made me think. Who knew: that the science to actually make oxygen was relatively simple - the caloric properties of potatoes - crop production in an enclosed space - solar energy practical requirements and other stuff but most importantly what it takes to just live. all of this may sound a bit boring however there is the drama of being left behind on an alien planet with supplies for thirty or so days. astronauts are a special breed. the drama of the situation provides context for the need of detailed science. it all makes sense. relax and just be nerd
B005LAII12|5.0|One of the funniest movies to come out recently. If you enjoy Family Guy, you will like this movie. The jokes are great, the story is creative and its downright hilarious. the Unrated version is slightly different than the movie theater version and is worth watching.
0143036424|5.0|Craig Johnson is a very good writer and the other characters from one book to the next provide interesting support to the adventures of Walt Longmire. I recommend it highly.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|First movie is pretty good but the other two movies get progressively worse as the series goes on with over-the-top action sequences, and the horrible acting of the woman in Dark Of The Moon makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep in comparison. But both women do look amazing in blu-ray.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Excellent ending to a riveting trilogy. You'll be glad to have closure to the hunger games that had you captured two books prior.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The Hunger Games series of books is a phenomenon and the movies and cast of actors really capture the spirit of the first book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|So many cool birds. Good times spent playing this with my son. It is worth the $3 to by it.
B007ATOBFO|5.0|My daughter and I are learning Mandarin, and she loves this movie, so it was a definite win-win - great movie, definitely recommend!
0060987464|4.0|This book was very interesting. Not for the pure minded, just a warning. I could not put it down, as gross as it was I loved it.  Brian Warner is very creative and talented. Some of his thoughts and ideas are so close to my own, at times I felt as though I was reading my own journal. I hope he writes more books, I'd buy them!
B001AGXEA6|4.0|Beetlejuice is one of my all time favorite movies and while the Blu Ray quality is certainly better than my previous VHS copy, it's not perfectly crystal clear and neither is the sound. There is one fun part about this Blu Ray too, it includes 3 of the Beetlejuice cartoon episodes.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|It is a bit slow at the beginning, it gets better eventually. Overall, it is a good movie specially for kids.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great puzzle game! just like the Wii version! Addicting and appropriate for all ages. The design of the game as well as the graphics are superb!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book touched on several ideas and beliefs that I have held true for years. I believe that one day, the world will finally open its eyes and see the real truth. We are the masters of our own world and our own fate. We are God's.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging but not frustrating. It is fun to play alone or in a pair. The app works well with no cliches b so far.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband, who wanted to own the movie.  He enjoyed it.  I didn't, so much, but that's just me and the story.  Probably should have given this 5 stars, because the quality was fine.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Far more dumb than I even expected. I'm a big Mark W fan.....but this was ridiculous. Save your money please.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Bought this for my 4 year old grandson's birthday, and had it sent to him in Texas, so I didn't see it personally.  However, he loved the movie. :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I keep going back to this classic.  The game is challenging and yet solvable. It beats having to shuffle and deal each time.
0307454541|5.0|I could not put it down.. and if i had to i was right back to it again.. easy reading
B006H5120E|3.0|I liked the movie however, the 3D graphics could be better. I would not recommend it because it was like watchind an ordinary blue ray movie.
030745455X|5.0|I could not put it down.. and if i had to i was right back to it again.. easy reading
B006JSXYPA|3.0|The movie was good. the 3D graphics could be better. I would only recommend this movie if 3D graphics is not important.
0307742539|5.0|I could not put it down.. and if i had to i was right back to it again.. easy reading
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing story great lay out the story is amazing this story is my second time reading it I hope people will do the same

B00AA7O22U|5.0|We loved the first one but the second was even better.  Would highly recommend this movie.  Has a few suprises.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I had to have this... and its perfect... it is the begining of a classic collection...a must have by everyone
B001FOK70S|5.0|It's from some Korean company. There are no subtitles, though, in case you might think there is.<br /><br />Movie only. Other menus include a Lynch filmography and I think a Lynch bio, but those are only frame shots, not interviews or anything.<br /><br />Perfect for those who just want the movie on DVD. No frills.
0425263916|5.0|I could not put it down.. and if i had to i was right back to it again.. easy reading
B000FC10WU|5.0|I love it.  A mystery lover can never go wrong with Agatha Christie.  She's one of the best ever and, certainly, an example to any writer who came after.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|I actually haven't seen the movie yet, so it was nice to read the book first. Actually, my first Kindle book read. Good read,took less then a week to go through. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Dr. Quinn is something I can sit down with all of my family, all ages, and truly enjoy.  Thank you so much!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|What can I say. We loved, loved this movie. From my one year old(who actually sat through most of the movie)to my 57 year old mother. Every one enjoyed it. Even my sons watched it with out complaining about it being too girly.
B009NPA3Q4|2.0|Save your money.  This album is a dud. Disappointing since I had expected so much.  He should have left the songwriting to people with more experience--he's not ready for such a heavy project.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Super cool app. You get to create your own stick man character that get's used in the game. Highly recommend.
030759565X|5.0|The best blog, the best book<br />my first place to go for any recipe.<br />I love it and my friends do to<br /><br />Luigi
B005HSL626|4.0|the kids love this game, but I don't get it. As long as it's their favorite, that's all that matters to me!
B005LAIGQ4|1.0|The Alaskan Inuits and the big oil company got together and decided it'd be the best PR if they put on a big show of trying to save the 3 whales instead of going on about their bloody business as usual. It showed the whale-killers in such an earnest, altruistic and humane light I almost wanted to start bawling at what a sad tale it was that they were *forced* with no choice but to continuously slaughter and massacre a species of beautiful animals so much more intelligent than them. What blatant propaganda.<br /><br />When whale killers and an oil company start smelling like roses and heroes in a movie, you don't need to stick around for the ending, which I didn't. What a mercy that I missed it too, because I read that Sarah Palin popped her face in to suck up some of the limelight. I was already well nauseous by that point. If you care about whales & other sentient beings and propaganda kind of makes you sick, you'll want to skip this fairy tale.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I finished it in one day!! I couldn't put it down. It won't disappoint you! I will definitely be reading more books by her!
B009MB682W|5.0|I love Bond and I love the themes. I even discovered a new favorite (Gladys Knight) and was shocked to find one I didn't like (Madonna).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved everything about it, there are no dislikes. This is a lot more realistic then 50 shades of Grey. I can't wait for the next book.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|Couldn't beat the price and it's 51 songs of pure greatness (minus that one remix). Amazon beats GooglePlay every time!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|great app. these guys know weather. any location,any time,even on the go. a must for vacation time. best there is.
0767836324|5.0|I bought this is as a present for my husband, because of the way he talked about loving it as a kid.  We still thoroughly enjoy watching Hook.  Great movie for adults, even more so than it is for kids.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|This movie had its funny moments.  There were some places where it dragged a bit.  I thought the cameos by a few famous actors were pretty neat (even the voice over).  Plenty of Family Guy type moments ( I liked), but there were a few times when the jokes fell flat.  All in all a decent movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very enjoyable book. I look forward to the next two books to see what happens with Katniss & Peeta.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|If ever a movie appeared to be an infocommercial for an organization this is it.  It had all the earmarks of a set up as  a public service spot, the crash happening near a church, the faith of a flight attendant. A total disappointment after seeing the previews in the theater.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Bourne was kind of a good guy in the first three films, not here,<br />in one scene he kills 4 security guards who work at a normal factory.<br />But the worst part is the office massacre when an employee snaps and<br />kills everyone, very troubling to watch, don't waste your money.
0345803485|1.0|I love good erotica. Unfortunately, Fifty Shades of Grey is neither good nor erotic.  I made it about half way through this book before giving it up. I gave it one star because 0 stars was not an option. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing or reading the other two books in this triolgy.
B007YJ8ZRK|4.0|Liked the movie but my problem is that I can't manipulate the video in order for me to put it on my Iphone or PSP. That is my suggestion to you Amazon instant video allow the buyer to use their purchased material however they want to use it.
B00000ITOY|4.0|This will be a great gift to play with our granddaughter.  We received it quickly and we are very happy with the quality.
B0039208CG|4.0|My daugher has become quite the Batman fan and I bought this movie to complete her collection.  She absolutely loves everything Batman, so this was a perfect addition.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so fun. I tottally recommend it! You can get coins powers turn and you can bye powers guys and backgrounds with your coins.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|We have been catching reruns of this series, and run into episodes we cannot find.  Amazon is great to fill in the missing ones - always the most interesting, of course!  The show is a combination of quirky humor and murder mystery with a hint of romance around the edges.  Not a gritty, realistic show, but enjoyable and watchable for the relationships as well as the events.  Good show to watch to relax from a hectic day.
B005COO1X6|4.0|A fun, short story. If you are a Stephen King fan and have an hour I would recommend this one.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Draw a Stickman : EPIC is a really fun adventure game fun you go out and try to find your friend, which you draw and then name , who was taken into a book by an evil stickman who also has a magic pencil.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This was a Christmas gift.  The only thing that i really regret now is that I will have to pay taxes on amazon now as of Jan. 1st
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was fun, mostly a hidden items game but the puzzles it contained were relatively challenging. Definitely a good way to waste some time.
1608870081|5.0|This is a must Have for all PotterHeads (Harry Potter fans) and much cheaper than it is on WBshop.com get it.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Good cooler for the price.  Had a few hiccups during the install bc the manual doesn't cover all of the supported socket types.  For anyone wondering, you need to use the middle screw setting for FM2 socket.  I had to reapply thermal paste bc I used the wrong setting at first.  It does kind of fit at another setting so I thought that it was just a tight fit.  Be warned that it should not be a stretch to get the screws in.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Not up to the caliber of the first three Bourne movies. Not a bad movie - just below our expectations based on the Matt Damon versions.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Although the book is highly unrealistic, as it should be, it is very interesting and comical as a light legal read.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It's deffinatly kinda cool to see from the point of view of th Hogs! The app is free so not too much of a loss or gain!
1401324649|5.0|This is a book that is a combination of Forrest Gump meets Albert Camus's Stranger meets Quentin Tarantino with a dash of Harold Fry.<br /><br />From the beginning I thought this book was going to be an even older Harold Fry and nothing more but very quickly this became a funny, wild, bloody mess. Allan Karlsson is turning 100 but he decides that instead of spending his big day in a retirement home he's going to take to the road and find an adventure. Along the way Allan manages to find himself in the center of a gang with some equally colorful characters including a man who is a professional college student and a sassy elephant.<br /><br />In addition to Allan current escapades we get a glimpse into what made him the man he is at 100 years old. Allan is a very interesting man who happened to find himself playing an instrumental role in some of the biggest events of the 20th century including the invention of the atomic bomb (for more than 1 nation).<br /><br />The author of this book didn't take much time to jump into interesting events. I was disappointed by the first chapter that described Allan's childhood but I was motivated to keep reading because of the cliffhanger from part 1. After I forced my way past that part of the book I was hooked, I didn't want to stop reading. Allan is one of the most ludicrous and likable leading characters in any book I've ever read. I highly recommend this book if you want a entertaining and funny read.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|At first I thought this would cloud up space Bc I bought it once and didn't look back...However surprisingly the app is more fun than I thought! It has a sort of simple ,old school gamers vibe! Overall an entertaining app!
B004EEPOBI|4.0|The first Oscar Wilde book I've read. Sometimes, it was a little dry or pretentious, but it was overall pretty good.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Pretty fun game somewhat like a puzzle though! You basically find the best way to get the goo balls to the pipe to complete the level by creating bridges,latters, and etc. Using the actual little goo balls!
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I wish every one could read this book and make the changes to improve our where we work. Bring more heart felt energy into our world.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love the game but some times it can take up to 6hrs for a home to make. And its not really free. but it is fun to play.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it! It's good quality, made out of metal, and looks really nice. But, as any Star Trek nut will tell you, IT'S NOT A TOY! It's a collectible. ;)
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|this movie was very very good. wish they would have shown back to how the younger version became a looper and gave us that story the way the did with older Joe. great action, emotion but not much of a thinker(for me anyways) I wont spoil the end but I was talking to the TV (watching alone lol) saying just do #%$@&^#&* from early on. Also loved the Acting very much! Joseph Didn't even look like \\"HIM\\" great job there!, and he killed it great performance Mr Gordon-Levitt!! only other thing I wish they could have touched on was the rain mans story of who he was ect in the future. great concept I Loved the movie and say its a must watch! You'll either love the ending or hate it. I loved it!! Worth buying for sure!
B0068LYEHA|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found it equally relatable and amusing, but many have described it hilarious and I just didn't. I only got a few good out-loud laughs, but I would still recommend it if asked.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Magic Mike had a lot of promise, but it does not deliver.  Not much real dancing, just the same &#34;grab a girl from the audience and pull her legs around  your waist,&#34; or &#34;throw her down on the stage and hover over her.&#34;  The story was just plain stupid and poorly written. The &#34;Dallas&#34; character came across as a real sleeze, too.  No professional dancer behaves like this bunch did.  All in all, it was just &#34;Showgirls&#34; with guys instead of semi-naked women. For me, it was a waste of money. If  you just have to see it, rent it for a buck at a kiosk someplace, but don't buy it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|If you like the way Facebook is laid out on your PC, you'll absolutely hate this app.  Its nothing like the Real Facebook on a PC.  But, there is nothing else out there.
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|This is an all-out fun, charming and entertaining movie that we all (guys and girls) really enjoyed. Not a typical &#34;rom-com&#34; formula.  We watched it twice on New Year's Eve! Lots of big-name celebs are featured, but Zac Efron and Michelle Pfeiffer stole the show with their amazing chemistry and acting. Also, Lea Michelle gave the best-ever performance of Auld Lang Syne! Be sure to watch all the way through as the credits begin rolling at the end, where Zac Efron and Michelle Pfeiffer end up at the big party together and do some pretty funny dancing.  There are also &#34;bloopers&#34; from other cast members at the end, as well as the Gag Reel that features even more.  Everything about it was fun, start to finish.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This is silly, unless you have a HP Printer that has its own unique email address, don.t bother.  It does not work with my HP printer.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|My wife got me hooked on this show and itz a mind bender. Manchurian Candidate fans will enjoy this take on the original theme. Watching this program like many others on &#34;Prime&#34; is a rush since there is no &#34;I can't Wait till next week&#34;.
0802473164|5.0|I chose a 5-star rating because the book was in excellent condition (as advertised) and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|What more can I say I got this whole album for a steal! I love all the songs it was really it was like a electric pop it was really cool!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|We love the Big Bang Theory and when we finally purchased a Blu Ray player, this TV series was top on our list. Funniest show on TV.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is so addictive and trying to find them all, game after game is a new adventure for anyone to play
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie when it was in theaters and was excited for the book. It was better than I expected!
1419705849|5.0|Anything to make children read is a good for the mind, heart and and soul.  Reading will help with other things in life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story very healing! I cried I laughed I truly felt the love of the characters. I related in so many ways.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Love the series, love the series and love the series,  and by the way Tom Selleck is still hot for his age
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very cool and interesting would recommend to anyone love the graphics and story line. Games should be more like this.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It was a nice change up from Matt Damon.  Great story line and it worked well without him.  Nice surprise!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such an amazing book but it pissed me off way too much.  I hope it does the same for you.
0307943259|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  It was something she wanted<br />and I think she was happy with the selrction.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A slow read at the beginning, reasonably suspenseful throughout, ending is a disaster. Felt like a waste of time after reading the last 10 pages or so.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I got this CD for Christmas.  After listening to the song, 'Need You Now', on Pandora and liking it,  I put it on my Amazon Wish List.  Listened to it for the first time today. Just love every song!
0061438294|4.0|I volunteer in a Social Service Organization wherein we get professional Scammers, liers, dead beats along with the really sincere ones.  It is sometimes difficult to tell the difference.  Lots of our clients are homeless and out for what they can get.  These represent a big minority, but it is nice to be able to tell the difference up front.  This book helped me greatly.  Helping those in real need is totally rewarding.  Fortunately, that's MOST of our clients.
B00005NB8K|2.0|I wonder if something is wrong with my DVD player... it seems this film wasn't encoded as anamorphic (to fill my widescreen TV like all other films) but they burned the letterbox onto a 4:3 encode. So I see the picture surrounded by black.<br /><br />Also the soundtrack sounds flat... I read somewhere that you have to enable a 5.1 track but I haven't found that option.<br /><br />I picked this up at a flea sale eager to relive my first experience with this film in a proper theatre many years ago... so far no love! I wonder if I got a non-special edition disc in a special edition box.
B004OC07N0|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend prior to starting a new job. The position represented a significant transition and so I purchased this book to ease the transition. I am eased with it and thought that it provided valuable insights. It was a bit short and the content somewhat limited, but the over material was good and gave me some things to think about during the transition.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this to others making significant transitions.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I think this film charaterizes the abilities of both lead actors to make veiwers believe in what they are watching.
B009M1QRM8|4.0|I am a great fan of Agent Pendergast and this did not disappoint.  Already waiting for the next instalment please
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a seek and find game, but it's sometimes a little short on items to find. It asks you to find the same items again and again. It's ok for vegging out though.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a fabulous game and gives an endless ammount of entertainment!  I only have one warning: its terribly addictive! :)
0345803493|4.0|My wife isn't much of a reader but when the Fifty Shades triology was released and she heard that &#34;everyone&#34; was reading it she asked for it so I ordered it for her.<br /><br />She appears to have enjoyed the books (she ended up getting and reading all three).<br /><br />I'm glad that she picked up a book and read something!
B004UFEJW6|4.0|I had all but forgotten about this movie -until I saw it in my recommendations. Look, this isn't \\"The Thing\\" (another of Russell's movies) but it is a well done action/sci-fi flick. We're not talking instant classic but it does have a bit of a cult following. The effects may be dated by today's standards but as a whole, this movie holds up very well.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is done so well, and its so fun. It is such a creative game too. I could play this for hours. I got it when it was free but I would of definitely bought it for the price listed now. :) love it.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|It works simply, quickly, and reliably. Of course it's a slimmed down, simplified version of what you'll have in your main computer at work or at home. It's an App for a cell phone people. It's supposed to be smaller than a computer program. That way it burns less memory and processor capacity. It does what it's supposed to do and does it very well.<br /><br />It's a good app.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is perfect! I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys solving mysteries! perfect perfect o did i mention perfect?
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I'm finding I love these books as much if not more the second time around! The characters, especially Jamie and his words of wisdom on loving someone, are excellent and the location and history description's wonderful
0439023513|3.0|I will make this short.<br /><br />I found the book very juvenile at times which I suppose was intended but still annoying.  On the other hand, it has very mature themes and is depressing throughout, there are no happy moments, not really any love story any more either.  A few times characters would come up with an idea and then they would go on to talk about as if it is the only logical thing to do, even though the idea was trash in the first place (at least in my opinion).  I won't say it insulted my intelligence, but it could definitely improve in that area.  Finally, it felt like a lot of the plot points were forced to work and reaching in some instances.  The ending seemed like it was thrown together in a few hours. It didn't really make a lot of sense and it seemed like it was there just to give the book a \\"twist\\" or something - a pointless endeavour.<br /><br />However, it was still entertaining and a fair addition to the trilogy. I based my rating on how enthralled I was with it. For comparison I would give book 1 a 5/5 and book 2 a 4/5.
B009K2SLYG|5.0|This movie was a one of the ones we stayed up late watching in High School and we still quote today. It is stupidly funny and I still enjoy watching it. We even went and saw the stage play in Vegas!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app really surprised me with how easy it was to get everything working. Absolutely no issues. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting full, quick easy way to have full control.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Please do not rent and try to watch this.  I say this to you because I love you and don't want you to go through the six minutes of hell I did.  I know what you're thinking  \\"Oh, Tom Cruise is in this.  Alec Baldwin.  I love these songs.  How bad could it be?\\"  No!  Walk away.  They are just there waiting to s*** on everything you love.  There is no non-lethal dose of drugs or alcohol to make this watchable.    I actually came here to try to get a refund since I only watched six minutes of it, but I feel much better and the money better spent warning my fellow humans.    Keep looking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good quality and fun game! if you like mind games and puzzles this app is for you! my sister introduced this to me and I showed my mom and now we all play it. great game if you have spare time or want a game during some sort of time interval!
0316067601|5.0|I can't express to you how moving this book was for me.  I literally laughed, cried, and thought about the strength courage of these men during the times in between reading the chapters.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Everyone should read this.
B00476Q8KO|5.0|Action-packed film with oodles of character.  Jake Gyllenhaal is beautiful and story is intricately woven throughout the Persian reign.  Probably not appropriate for under 12, as the action includes a lot of sword swinging.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I use this as my workout music.  It is upbeat, raw, and fun.  The way that Madonna evolves with the times is truly amazing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game is fun to play and helps by showing how to win so that for a change I can WIN!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|An amazing story that is so real it's almost like you are watching this right before your own eyes. Makes me hug my babies tighter !
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband laughs and says it is a game for kids but I really do enjoy playing and seeing if I can get all of the pigs
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This battery monitor is more accurate than the native one. It gives a breakdown of battery life for each available activity. It constantly recalculates as the device is in use.
B002VECM72|4.0|I choose this rating because there were some intense scenes in the movie, such as the car accident and the beating up one another. I like the movie itself, but towards the beginning, the movie was flashing every 2-3 minutes. I recommend this movie to 10-12+, anyone who likes to make a difference in the world and football fans!
1451695195|2.0|The author went into great detail about his coma and the sorrow it brought his family. However his not being able to put into words his descriptions of \\"heaven\\" leaves one taking the doubting physcians and scientists point of view.<br />I guess I was wanting what the title implied...\\"PROOF.\\"<br />I'm sorry I wasted my money.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I was looking for the Appstore app, this was not what I expected. I buy my devices at retail stores or from my cell phone service provider.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|First off the first one , MIB was the best, number two was , compared to this? Just ok.<br />The effects and story were pretty good, but TOMMY LEE... he acted like somebody was holding his family hostage in order to force him to make this movie. Its been awhile since I watched it, but theres not much on TV so, give it a watch.<br />Will doesnt look like &#34;the kid&#34; anymore so he might need to adapt to a newer (older) character persona.<br />Just my 2 cents...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I chose this app because of the previous ratings.<br />Worked well on my tablet freeing up enough space for it to work more efficiently
B007SYWFRM|2.0|The message about Adobe and which Adobe to install on the Kindle is confusing to a newbie like me.<br />I haven't spent much time yet, but it looks like I won't be able to use it.
B00637HXNG|5.0|I have a Sony KDS-60A2000 HD 1080p TV and a Sony Blu-Ray BDP-S550 player (neither-3D) and the disc played without any major issues.  The only thing I noted was some of the lighting colors looked somewhat odd at times.  Also, when they did some smoke effect on the stage the picture got rather &#34;flat&#34; but I've noticed that on other Blu-Ray concerts when they use smoke on stage with lighting or lasers.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the performance.  I'm not sure why they went with the 3D effect for this production but it worked ok for me in the end.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Good read, disappointing ending, good character build, easy and fast read that I was able to finish in two days
B004RKXHZY|3.0|I enjoyed the book but didn't find that it lived up to the standard that Anna and the French Kiss set. While I found the  snippets of Anna and Etienne a nice additions to the book the multiple large time gapsimpractical romantic situations, too many crying scenes, and unrelatedable characters made this book a failure in my eyes. However I am not a book Scrooge so I shall tell any possiblereaders that there is definitely an unmistakable attraction between the protagonist and male love interest that must have required the interesting and creative mind that only Stephanie Perkins possesses. However it is still a disappointment.
B001PPGAK8|5.0|I was originally looking to rent,but discovered this copy that had the digital rental included for free with purchase!<br /><br /> Great quality, great deal that gave me more than I expected.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book to readers, who are seekers.  Who want to question reality as we know it. Eben clearly communicates his experiences, as experienced from no neocortex.  Perhaps his unique situation provides a deeper view of reality that is unfiltered.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love historical fiction and this is one of the best!! Lavinia had a hard life but soon learned what life was all about.
B00425S1H8|5.0|i am so pleased t recommend this item. for how long i cant say but there are many Serial items that i thought were out dated and useless. then i discovered this .<br />great!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I watched this with my 6 year-old grandson, who seemed fascinated with the entire movie. The animation is delightful; the colors amazing. Unlike some of the animated movies that are filled with violence and darkness, this one seems peaceful and filled with light.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|a classic movie still amusing every time i see it, i would rent it again next Christmas, great family movie
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|The story is unusual and the idea of a young man with an old woman may seem repugnant to many but Maude, even at 79 comes off as so cute and even sexy.  The gift that she gives this young man seems to be one of finding the value in life but based on the ending it may seem to be more a promotion of hedonism.  The unconditional love and understanding that Maude provides though seems to be just the thing that Harold needs to help him heal from his rather cold mothering.  Car chases and violence should appeal to the men and the romance should appeal to the women so I think it is a movie for everyone.
B004GXJBWA|5.0|Was just perfect size for what we needed it for...Good quality. My daughter is teaching kindergarten and using these in her job chart.
B005JABSB6|5.0|We've watched two full length movies with these glasses and they work great. Requires about 90 minutes of charging time between use. The batteries hold their charge well - we were able to watch Avatar (over 3 hours) without any problems.
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|I can't say I was terribly impressed. The catapult is what all the kids had the most fun playing with.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great job by Grisham once again, a must read... very well written, great job keeping you guessing and a great twist. Can't wait till the new book.....
B008H6GHL0|5.0|Got love Resident Evil movies. I got this for my son for his birthday and we really enjoyed this movie.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|i enjoyed the book but more so being able to read it on my new kindle was so much easier..and quicker..reading 2nd one now.
0140067477|5.0|Really in depth and actually a fun read. Easy for those who don't want a difficult and confusing explanation. Good book!
B00A50PE6K|4.0|I love Christmas and i particuarly love the first Glee Xmas cd but with the exception of Lea michele's beautiful rendition of 'O Holy Night ' and a few other tracks, good but not a favorite . However if you are a Gleek and collecting all the volumes then add it to the collection .
0061726834|4.0|I'm going to start with a disclaimer - I didn't want to read Delirium. Why? A variety of reasons, but mostly because I'd heard there's a BIG cliffhanger at the end. I hate cliffhangers with a passion. And the idea of the story sounded so good, that I was scared I wouldn't enjoy it and I hate being disappointed! But when I won a copy of the book it stared at me from the table beside my sofa for weeks, taunting me. So with my cynical eye wide open, I started reading.....<br /><br />I found the beginning of the book, in fact, the first half was OK - I liked Lena as a character but I wasn't enamoured with her - she seemed a little, well, blah. There wasn't anything about her that really made me sit up and take notice. The world building in the first half of the book was OK, not great and left me feeling a little like there was something fundamentally missing. When Lena met Alex I had that 'oh, that's kinda sweet' feeling, and it wasn't until much later in the book that I really started to warm up to him as a character.<br /><br />As the book progressed, the world building did get better and I felt that I knew more about the world, the conspiracies and secrets and the way that the government was manipulating the residents of Portland with veiled threats and bullying.<br /><br />The idea of the book, that of love being 'curable' is quite disturbing. Imagine not loving your children, or your family and friends, even the person you share your life with - not having the urge to laugh, cry, sing or dance is a depressing idea!<br /><br />The writing is great - that 'one more chapter' feeling was definitely there, but I think the time that it took me to read the book is a direct reflection of how the pacing worked for me - I read the first 200 pages over the space of 5 days, and the last 240 pages in an evening.<br /><br />Yes, the cliffhanger is massive and I immediately started reading Pandemonium (which is going to mess with my head so much. I know there's a cliffhanger there too!) otherwise the physical safety of the book would have been in serious doubt.<br /><br />In summary, Delirium is a great idea, good execution and the characters and dialogue are realistic and likeable, if not a little bit crush-able. The pacing builds gradually, but 200 pages is a long lead in, so if you need action from page one and cliffhangers make you want to punch a wall, proceed with caution.<br /><br />This all sounds a little negative, but that's not my intention at all. I really enjoyed Delirium and I'd recommend it to most readers of dystopian YA.e too!) otherwise the physical safety of the book would have been in serious doubt.<br /><br />In summary, Delirium is a great idea, good execution and the characters and dialogue are realistic and likeable, if not a little bit crush-able.

B00APUQH0W|5.0|We need more movies like this one.  It has a good story .  Good acting, good writing and good direction!
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book a few months ago, but it took me a while to build up the courage to read it. Reading about cancer is a difficult thing for me to do, as cancer has touched my own life several times and the subject hits pretty close to home. But upon seeing nothing but glowing reviews for The Fault in Our Stars, I knew that I had to read it.<br /><br />Both Hazel and Augustus are fantastic characters - perfectly suited to each other, their personalities are both smart and sarcastic, a combination that I love. Hazel's negativity is sympathetically portrayed - in a girl that isn't living on borrowed time it would be irritating, but for someone that has lived with a spectre over their head for years, it's understandable and refreshing - anyone that lives with a ticking clock would struggle to be positive and sunny all the time.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the trip to Amsterdam that they took (the mention of the town that I live in had me tickled pink), because I knew the places they went to and the experiences they had were pretty close to reality. Those trees in autumn really screw with my allergies.<br /><br />John Green writes a simple story, but keeps the focus on the characters and their experiences, both good and bad. The Fault in Our Stars is nothing if not a page turner, and I challenge anyone not to care deeply for the characters, and to keep their emotions in check whilst reading this.<br /><br />As a book about battling cancer, it's not all fun times and puppies, but even the sadder moments are written sympathetically, without being condescending. And although this was a difficult book for me to read, I'm so glad I overcame my fears and took the plunge.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Excellent CD for his freshman release!!!!! AAAAA++++++ it was a very good cd hope his next one is just as good!
B008518MOW|3.0|I was a fan of the other Men in Black movies, but was kind of disappointed with this.  Not much of a plot and not all that funny. I hope III was the end of the line for Men In Black.
0440422973|4.0|Very cute and so funny.  enjoyed very much.  Grisham is a great author and can write about anything.  Gave as gifts.
B005LAJ212|5.0|My daughter is hooked on this series.  It was the perfect Christmas gift for her, and the price was right.....
B009D4Z7SY|5.0|I feel in love with Emeli Sandé from the moment I first heard &#34;Daddy&#34;. I'm upset that the special edition isn't available in my country, but that's why I ordered the import and it's amazing! The alternate version of &#34;Breaking the Law&#34; is too addictive to ignore. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
B0032KNA4I|3.0|Typical end of the world type movie.  The action parts and special effects were well done, but didn't think it had much of a plot or story line.  I've seen better.............
0316228532|5.0|I was stunned by this book. On the surface, it had everything I love about an English village mystery, with all sorts of colorful characters, but Rowling explores all the darkest problems of our present-day world. Compulsively readable, funny, and tragic.<br />I loved this book
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Great movie.  If you're a dad who is just sitting back and taking your family and life for granted, you need to watch this movie.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Cute family film, but lesser quality than the original Ice Age. Adults can enjoy the film as well. Always enjoy Scrat!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Big fan of this band!  Halestorm and In this moment are great bands that I have recently found and love the chick, rock band greatness.
B0091LS07E|5.0|In my opinion it is one of her best album, its my second favorite after AS I AM ALBUM. Alicia shows growth and maturity of motherhood and her sexy side.
B009MO57H6|2.0|I have watched all the resident evil movies and was very excited to see this new one only to be disappointed in the entire movie. It seemed like a video game with lots of gunfire..... I still dont get what the story theme was.  I probably wont watch another.  Very very unsatisfied.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I like the way the DVDs are packaged and I think the box is cute. I'm not much for watching the interviews with the cast or alternate scenes, but they seem decent. Basically, I love the Gilmore Girls and these are not available thru Netflix.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app!!!  It's great for keeping you on a schedule and marking where you are. It would be nice to be able to select a different version once instead of every time you scroll to the next portioned reading. Maybe you can but I don't know how.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this game!! Has great storyline. Has great graphics. I would recommend this game to any one!! Can't wait for the next!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Was sent and received unbelievably fast, product was exactly as described and was a wonderful gift to my fiance.  Definitely worth the amount I paid for it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is great for reading and a great classic book at that I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B006O6FK2W|4.0|My grandson loved this vehicle but it was a little hard for him to figure out how to put the batman figure in to shoot him out.<br />It is well made and I think it will hold up well to a 6 year old.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I got this headset for Christmas, and I am loving it. The headset itself feels sturdy and has a perfect weight. It fits perfectly on my head and the leather earcups sit comfortably around my ears. The battery life is decent and I enjoy the fact that I can charge the headset while I game and the detachable mic is a plus.<br /><br />The audio is amazing using the 5.1 Surround. The included presets is an added bonus, though the only one i find useful is the increase of footsteps for ANY gamemode (preset 7).  I have experienced ZERO signal interferrences with its 5.0GHz frequency, and the range of the headset is about 25ft before it brgins loosing the signal. I now ditched my Dre Solo HDs and began using this instead.<br /><br />Conclusion: Great Headset and would recommend this if you have the money (at the time $200)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Have been a Jack Ryan fan since Hunt for the Red October and always looking for them.  Liked all his movies too.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Wonderful show! Highly recommended! Easy to get addicted to! Great story line! About so much more than zombies! Watch it!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent. It kept the watcher on his or her toes wondering which was real or which was memories.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|okay look this app isn't for small children or adults that don't read everything before they agree to it. besides when you click on okay it sends you to another message box that asks you how much. you can then quickly exit out ofthat and continue with your game. ilovee this game. five stars!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good game lost track of time while playing kept me intreged and not to hard but not easy cant waite for the next one
B005LAII62|5.0|...granted, I tend to go into movies with 0 expectation because my taste in entertainment tends to divert from the norm. I just watched this today on a whim, and I thought it was cute, with a good message. I'd watch it again; I'll probably buy the DVD in the near future. I highly recommend it. (Yes, there is *some* profanity, but from what I recall, it wouldn't be any different than hearing the \\"d\\" word in Church - which I have, several times). I liked the characters pretty well; Norman the most, honestly, due to the fact they made everyone around him seem on a lower level of intelligence.<br /><br />But, all in all, I recommend this movie and it's worth a second watch.
B0027MJU00|5.0|What a story I am so impressed by the way the book twits and the moment I  think I have it all figured out I'm thrown by a unforeseen surprise. Hooked on Gillian Flynn loved gone girl, this book was equally riveting
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book is really fun and it reminds me of my daddy's life when he was a kid. If you like funny books and crazy adventures you'll like this book.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I researched which virus protection was the highest rated and this was it!  So you can't go wrong with AVAST  mobile  security
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I'm older now and thought I pretty much knew what makes me tick. Well, I learned a lot from this book, not only about myself but about my loved ones. One of the premises of &#34;Quiet&#34; is that we are essentially wired a certain way at birth.  Observations of a group of 4-month-olds revealed that introversion/extroversion could be predicted among the infants based on the infants' response to various stimuli.  For instance, a burst balloon brought a wide range of reactions among the babies, from indifference to inconsolable crying. It turns out that some of us are simply wired to be more sensitive to outside events, and that can predict introversion. The threshold question posed is how do you reenergize and refresh yourself -- introverts tend to find renewal in alone time while extroverts find renewal in a crowd.<br /><br />So why read it?  As a parent, it would have been helpful to understand the makeup of my children earlier.  I think i could have made better decisions and been more helpful as a parent. And as an adult, Cain's book explained a lot of why I am how I am. Very enlightening. Terrific book and one of the rare ones I've purchased for others.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was an amazing book. I highly recommend it to all readers. It kept me up late several night in a row. All night I was thinking, &#34;I NEED TO FINISH THIS BOOK!&#34; It was full of excitement, thrill, and mythology. A wonderful mix of modern and ancient times.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|The movie itself was rather well shot, the actors not too shabby, but the story line is somewhat strange and the movie wanting. I believe less special effects and better dialogue would have done this movie alot of good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I don't think it was as good as the first or second but it does answer most or all of your questions. Overall it is a great read.
B007H7XRLI|5.0|An interesting plot; a number of decent actors; and a viewer who thinks the movie rocks! I own this movie. THATS how much I liked it.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|After reading the first 10 volumes, I had to come back and let you all know this is a must read! Even if you don't like the zombie genre, the story is very compelling. For all you people who have watched the walking dead series on amc, you don't know the real governor. Plus, its very different than the comic. I'm addicted and I can't wait for new editions.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Vevo works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. This app makes downloading music videos a breeze. Very similar to you tube except this is for music videos only. I love it and would highly recommend it. This app is another must have!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I chose this book because I love romances and this one seemed to also be a comedy of sorts and I just couldn't put it down. Recommended to anyone 16 or older who still believe in fairy tales.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|THIS IS VERY UNIQUE YOU CAN LOOK UP A CHAPTER OR VERSE QUICKER. MOST PEOPLE ARE USING ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN THE CHURCH THAN CARING A BIBLE NOW DAYS.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Had a friend introduce me to this book and now I am so glad she did! This book was a great experience!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A typical Clancy (Jack Ryan) read....it grabs you at the very beginning and holds you until the end!  I really enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game almost as fun as the one and only game called, &quot;Temple Run&quot;. I knew there was game that are really fun but none are almost as good as temple run! I highly suggest you get this game! And temple run!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read.  Typical Vince Flynn (Mitch Rapp) novel.  Once you get started you can't wait to get to the end.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|I wanted to watch a fun, light hearted movie and what I got was a tedious, bad acted, travesty of film making that caters to shallow consumerism and sexual free for all with no point.  Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed Sex and the City and liked (not loved) Sex and the City I, but II is an embarrasment for everyone involved in it including me who paid to watch it.  Carrie Bradshaw should grow up. I no longer care about the character after this horrble film.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I GET KINDA CONFUSED ABOUT SOME OF RUSH'S ALBUMS!!!///THIS ONE IS THAT, A QUESTION???/// ABOUT ALL THE GREAT STUFF THEY HAVE DONE OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN HUGE,BUT THIS ALBUM-RUSH'S 2012'S CLOCKWORK ANGELS,IS ONE OF THOSE,MISSING???A QUESTION???WERE ARE THEY GONNA GO,UP,IT WOULD BE GREAT!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game, quick moving and several levels to keep you occupied. Good colors and motion, graphics are adequate to keep your eyes on the game.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I love this cd by the new,but the IS THE SAME??? Soundgarden of 1996!!!///\\"King Animal\\"2012, has it's great moments as weLl as some good songwriting,music-skilled with these rockers!!!///I LIKE IT ALOT!!!///IT IS A COMPLETE ALBUM!!!,,Thanks
B00004RF98|5.0|Grandddaughter adores this movie as she is a great dancer herself.  On a dismal NW day, what could be better than this movie and some warm cocoa?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great. Really awesome. Peeta is hot. :) :) :) >:) blah blah :) The book is better than the movie.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|This started out all right with fairly well developed characters but was lacking some grit for lack of a better word. It had some interesting and exciting moments, but I would just be getting into it and then the storyline would get repetitive in nature. The author would give the same information over and over.  As this was a book club choice, I had to stick with it.  But about the last 20 pages or so I just skimmed through to the end.  I really wouldn't recommend this novel.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Could not believe I was at the end.  The book did remain 86 percent complete.  I am sure the author is a lovely person, but I was very disappointed at the way the story just stopped.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the games. would love it even more if you didn't have to earn so many points. however, that is gaming in the tablet world
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game!! Quite addictive!! Has potential to compete with angry birds. Love the background music. It is worth downloading. Love the puzzles it provides.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love this series, and this collection is great as it is the un-cut edition, although PBS didn't take much out when it broadcast the episodes.  The storyline is beautifully interwoven and the interactions between the characters is interesting and compelling.  I can't wait for the next series.  If you love Downton Abbey as much as I do, buy this collection and enjoy it over and over again.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|My grandson loves this movie, me I think it is good also but I am a little older & like otheres too
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't see the movie so I can't compare it to that but I loved reading the trilogy. Great story and it gave me a lot to think about human nature.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|We really liked the actor in this when he was on LIFE (which was discontinued on tv)but when we watched the first three episodes it was porn.They could not get through an episode without showing plenty of nudity.sorry, there should be some kind of warning at least.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have this game on all my electronics , and it's the first game my kids wanted to download after getting iPods for Christmas.  Challenging for all ages, so addicting, and just enough strategy to not lose interest!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to switch between radar animation, current weather, 2-week forecast. video reports,<br />for favorite locations and nationwide.  And the ads in the free version are not oppressive.<br />v2.1.2 on Kindle Fire.
B0012909NQ|5.0|Genesis: When In Rome Live 2007<br />The definitive collection of a totally unique Prog-Rock band.<br />The staging and Photography are incredible
1416550550|5.0|great book! victorian intrigue with a heavy dose of fairy tale and art.  Jumps around from 1900 - 2005, from Australia to England, depending upon which part of the big mystery is unfolding so at first it is hard to grab hold of the story but well worth turning the pages till then.
0439023491|1.0|Poor service. Placed order 4 days ago and still has not shipped. Very dissapointed and will not be a repeat customer.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this second book! The excitement, the suspense of what would happen next just made me never want to put this book down!
1469984202|5.0|I bought this book on a friends recommendation ..... and boy did I enjoy the ride. Its a thriller based on post apocalyptic world. There are NO vampires, NO zombies, NO androids ... just regular humans facing the results of their own undoing. I would call it 'Hunger games' for adults ... in the sense there is no silly 'which boy to choose' question stretched for the length of an entire book. If you want that ... I suggest you look elsewhere.<br /><br />The first book will pique your interest .... if you didn't find it that great (the odds are less btw) ... trust me ... hold on ... read the second book and get plunged into the adventure !!<br /><br />Yes, the name could have been different .... and yes at times the descriptions could have been briefer ... but the name doesn't matter to me as much and the detailed description kinda helped me visualize the silo as I read the book.<br /><br />All in all ... excellent book(s) and I suggest you grab some while the price is low :)
B009IF7V2S|1.0|I'm not here to rate the actors, but the story line itself. What adults behave like this in real life?? I admit I too long for my younger days, but I did not act immature like these guys do. Grow up and act your age.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I would highly recommend this CD to everyone, especially fans of Carrie Underwood. Ever song on the CD is great.
0062073486|3.0|I enjoyed this &#34;period piece&#34; for what it was, an old fashioned, English, whodunit.  This was very early work for Agatha Christie and she was very good at keeping clear the ongoing multiple characters, making it a very easy read.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Until now I've only ever seen the movie... But I decided to read the book, and it was great! I was afraid that since it was written so long ago, the story might get lost in old-timey words, but this wasn't the case at all (I mean, sure they used words like queer in a sense that they aren't used now, but there was nothing too distracting or confusing). I especially liked that there was a bit of humor in the story. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud reading a book. Loved it, and recommend it!
B004R5Z30Q|3.0|Initially I found this to be a charming, well written piece, and was very disappointed in the tons of ongoing, graphic descriptions of horrifying, violence that I thought would never end.  I eventually found myself skim-reading over those area in an effort to somehow &#34;get past&#34; the horror and finally move on to the heart of the story.  I was sadly disappointed as it just dragged on and on.  When I would pick up the book I would find myself  dreading the experience. I stuck it out till the end because I valued the authors work, but I was left feeling very disappointed when the &#34;adventure&#34; was over.  I would not do that again.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game just wish they are up front about the app it's not free . they should not say it's s a free app then let you play and then tell you need to pay to finish they game how fair is that
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It's much fun while it lasts. Before you know it, the game is over.  It needs more levels. Anyone can beat the game.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great movie. Great performances by Gordon-Levitt and Willis. Great story. Very original, moving, and exciting. Well-directed. Overall a great movie.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Geared heavily for women. However it works as a great gap filler or quick workout for the guys. Ran my first marathon in October but this app still makes me sweat.
B0086700CM|5.0|its awesome....im addicted.....GET IT.....GET THE APP<br />....ITS AWESOME!!!!!you play it once n ur addicted to it........soooo yah u bettrr get it....
B00867GJYK|5.0|Purchased as a gift, came as I expected. Would highly recommend movie and adding this film to your movie collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is very descriptive, which makes very erotic. But what I like the most is that it keeps you interested the whole time, not just for the sex. Love it!!!
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|LOVE CHRISTINA, SHE HAS THE BEST VOICE EVER,SHE WAS GREAT IN THE MOVIE BURLESQUE, KEEP THEM COMING CHRISTINA. AND GOOD LLICK.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|what can i say, it is google. itr is juyst what it is. i would recoment it on its merits alone
B007JWKLMO|4.0|I have always been a fan of the Beatles and at 57 remain true to their music and history that lives on today because of such videos as this. While there is lots of new information and interviews in this one , I found times that it seemed like George was siting in the room with us as we watched. The magic of George's touch within his musical notes and chords are stronger than ever in so much of the music he wrote and produced. I am so glad to see that youth today have a chance to re-live those special moments of the greatest music era of rock & roll.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|I don't like the option that you have to play the game of UNO I just make sure all of the option's are set to off! They have jump in and uno 7-0 and two more options.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|The game is really fun, just a little on the short side.  If it was longer, or if there was more content, then it would be five stars.
030758836X|1.0|I don't understand how this book was chosen as one of the best books of 2012. I thought it was awful, and I'm really sorry I wasted my time and money on it.<br />I figured out the \\"big mystery\\" very early in the game and just kept reading to find out how the author would manage to unravel the mess (not very well). The worst thing about this book was the characters. There was no one in the book to like, never mind to identify with. Each one was more disgusting and unpleasant than the other.<br />This book seems to have benefited from a great deal of hype, and to my regret I fell into it as well. I'm going to read the reviews more carefully next time before reading something that is so highly touted. Interesting that it got more \\"bad\\" reviews on Amazon than on Goodreads!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I ordered this movie for my daughter.  It is a fantastic movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Lots of guy humor. as a grandmother if was funny but 30 something guys in the family found it belly laughiing funny.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I found this book easy to read and full of adventure. It wasn't at all typical, but not disturbing either. I wish there was more to read about their lives.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|I MiKayla  choose this rating because I HATED this dictionary so much that I gave it ONE star out of FIVE stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Takes alot of time to get going. after you get going can just check in every hour or so.. just for xp and gold... very addicting game.. alot of fun
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Funny, witty and sarcastic. The characters are relatable and have many amusing stories.  The actors are great, and the writing is fantastic.
B002HH9TUG|1.0|I used this on a PC.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Initial setup was easy.<br /><br />No lag, good reception.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />As others have stated, cheap build.<br /><br />Buttons number 3 and 6 (right shoulder) exhibit phantom presses.  Not sure if it's software or hardware.  In my case, I had to change these functions to something that wouldn't affect my gameplay.  I would not map either of these buttons to the handbrake :)<br /><br />Couldn't figure out how map button presses to keyboard presses with the included software and couldn't located advanced programming software compatible with this gamepad; maybe some third-party software is out there or maybe I just couldn't figure out how to navigate Thrustmaster's site.<br /><br />L2 and R2 are difficult to manage, especially when trying to combine with other key presses.<br /><br />I bought it for the steering wheel, but I found it difficult to use.  Trying to trim your steering left or right just a degree or so means switching your thumb to either side of the knob on the wheel.  The instructions state that you shouldn't place your thumb directly on the steering pad knob, and now I know why; after a couple of hours of using it this way, it now grinds when turning to the left.  I ultimately ended up switching back from 7-axis mode to 4-axis mode; for my tastes, the dual joysticks works better.<br /><br />Because of the integrated steering wheel, the D-pad is small and hard to get discreet button presses out of it.<br /><br />Handles are small for my hands (average size, male).<br /><br />Update: Left ministick won't register forward movement, stuck in reverse.  Useless.<br /><br />So to recap, after less than 20 hours of use, left ministick doesn't work right, L1, L2, DP-Down, and button 3 all register phantom presses, and steering wheel grinds like I've used it in a sandbox.  I'm not a heavy gamer and definitely not hard on gear; this is the first gamepad (out of 6 or so) that I've had physical failureson.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't believe it took so long to find this show.  The acting was incredible, the plot line was fantastic, I'd defiantly recommend this to others
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. This book is just one more example of why Stephen King is such a great writer and storyteller.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|We're used to seeing Bradley Cooper in movies like \\"The Hangover\\" and \\"Wedding Crashers\\".  So when I read a review of \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\", I was intrigued.  How would Cooper handle a challenging role like that of Pat Solatano, the bipolar mess of a main character in this movie, which was billed as a romantic comedy but is dark and gritty, more like an indie movie with a star like Joseph Gordon-Levitt?  Beautifully, is the answer, and he and the terrific cast of \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" make this movie work.<br /><br />In David O. Russell's gifted hands, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" becomes one man's struggle to right the world which he thinks has desperately done him wrong.  Pat (Bradley Cooper) is in deep trouble when we first meet him.  His mother cuts a deal with the courts for his early release from a mental institution in Baltimore and it is clear from the first that Pat is hardly ready for this transition.  He refuses to take the meds for his bipolar disorder, which was kicked into high gear when he discovered his wife in the shower with one of her teaching colleagues.  He almost beat this man to death, and despite institutionalization and group therapy, the rage is still boiling within.  At home, father Robert DeNiro is obviously walking a fine line himself.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic and has a plethora of OCD rituals which he employs before every game to ensure the team's victory.  Dad has anger issues also, and the two get into a fist fight before too long, so a cop is assigned to shadow Pat to ensure that he treads the straight and narrow.  At this point in the movie, it is difficult to find much humor.<br /><br />Into this mix walks Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany).  We saw just a glimpse of this gifted actress in \\"Like Crazy\\", where she played The Other Woman with such finesse and sympathy.  Her character in \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is much more complex, and she is a bit of a mess herself.  A young widow who reacts to her cop husband's untimely death with reckless promiscuity, she recognizes a kindred spirit in Pat.  She falls for him immediately, but he is too mired in his obsession with his wife to recognize it at first.  After cutting a sharp bargain with him, she begins spending a lot of time with Pat, and in turn this leads to redemption for both of them.<br /><br />At first I thought the plot device tied up the threads of the story a little too neatly, but then I decided it hardly mattered.  The acting by the entire cast is stellar, and I especially enjoyed DeNiro and his football obsession.  There is a scene in the Eagles' football stadium that is just funny and terrific.  And Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry, which really makes it work.death with reckless promiscuity, she recognizes a kindred spirit in Pat.

B00000DQSS|5.0|great shape . I was huge fan of kate bush because my mom play her music in her dance class.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This movie has works hard to maintain the sense of astonishment and despair at the power of evil.  But the only tools left seem to be explosions and betrayal.  The betrayal by Batman's lover and the heroism of Batman's burglar are not credible.  So unless you are fascinated by explosions, this movie is stupid.

B008N1LL42|2.0|Taylor Kitsch portrays yet another sullen and stubborn youth with authority issues (when has he ever done anything else?), who joins the Navy and somehow becomes a Lieutenant in what cannot be more than a year or two. The aliens, despite being able to travel across interstellar space with the purpose of conquest somehow cannot identify a threat unless it's looking at them. Their weapons technology and especially their ability to shoot straight or track targets are woefully inadequate to their mission. Rhianna never distinguishes herself other than to look completely miscast and out of place. Miscasting is especially rampant in this movie, where even Liam Neeson cannot mask his accent when he tries to deliver an emotional, and poorly written line.<br /><br />Good science fiction is at the very least plausible, if not it's simply techo-fanatsy. This film fails on so many levels it's difficult to address them but one that stands out is the act where a war memorial battleship (USS Missouri) is somehow brought into action complete with with live shells for the main guns. To get these guns to fire requires a handful of men to carry a shell through the ship to the gun that needs it. Since these shells weight a ton (literally) it would be an impossible feat for 3 times as many men.<br /><br />For a easily impressionable child the massive explosions and clownish bad-boy behavior of Kitsch (making a strong case for the worst actor in Hollywood), this film might provide a short time of brain-numbing imagery and slapstick comedy. For a Navy veteran and huge fan of good science fiction it just seemed like another poorly written Transformers episode. You might argue that it's a throwaway summertime movie, but that doesn't excuse dialog and situations completely ignorant of reality.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had originally steered away from reading this book because of all of the hype, however, I am sincerely glad that I did! I laughed, I cried, and my heart ached while reading these books. It has been truly liberating to be able to delve into this imaginary world!

For me the most useful part was the list of key questions to be asked, when working on a strategy:<br />- who is the client and why we matter to the client<br />- what we deliver to the client<br />- how we deliver it better than others and<br />- what will enable us to do it better than others.<br /><br />Nothing particularly new or different from the myriad of other business books, but still time and money were well spent.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I really liked this one better then the first one. There was more action, more characters and more adventure. Absolutely must see.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|For a Grishham novel, the plot is not as complex as some of his other works however an easy and entertaining read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|My ten year old daughter and I had a lot of fun doing this together.<br />I just wish it were a little easier to get around.  We completed this the first day.  It would have been nice if it were a bit longer, especially since I paid to upgrade.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Have been using this in a chruch computer for the 3 projectors and it works great.  Very fast and reliable setup.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|The quality of the pictures are not clear but have a grainy appearance. I really don't understand why I had to purchase this product because I thought it would have already been on my Kindle. I bought the same Kindle for my granddaughter only hers had 16 GB and she didnot have to purchase the camera. My Kindle cost more 32 GB and it didnot have the camera. Really!!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|All the planet earth series are always excellent movies.  Hope they come out with one big set of all the series.
B00632HWOG|2.0|hard to switch over from my 2 email addresses. font too small. dont like. wish i could get the old version back.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love this movie and the blu ray is superb.  very good price for the pack.  Finally Joss Whedon gets the respect he deserves.  He always bring a perfect mix of comedy, action, and suspense.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book was amazing. Without a doubt one of the best pieces of fiction that I've read in the past few years. Hopefully the movie does it justice.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|So different from the movie that i have loved for many years!  Much more fulfilling than the movie was. Loved it!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Kept me involved.  The plot and characters were real and interesting.  Clancy has been a favorite of mine for some time and this book lived up to my expectations.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Passes time well. I enjoy the transportation and business strategy of the game.  I thought the only drawback was not enough earning opportunities.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Until now I've just thougth he simply is the king of pop, rock and soul. With this album, however, I finally realized that he is God of mucic. Although I have more apetite for classical music where genius such as Mozart, Bcah can compete each other with creativity and a lot of virtuosos shows their own skills, Michael, in my true estimation, is the only one who can supberb them. I have always thougtht Heaven treats people in equal way and with this reason, the heaven expediated the date he calls Michael.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I think this book just ruined my rating qualifications, a 5 star may be much harder to reach from now on! This book is SO AMAZING, from start to finish--which is shocking to me! Normally I suffer through the first 1/3 to 1/2 of a book, trying to get attached to characters, etc. The first part of the book is soooooo incredibly funny, I was laughing and laughing (laughing so hard I was snorting)! There were moments that absolutly took my breath away. Charactors were way too easy to get to know and love. Then the second half was totally shocking, and I didnt hurt the love story of the book--which I greatly appreciated.<br /><br />I loved this book, it was Amazing--as I said before, \\"this book just ruined my rating qualifications, a 5 star may be much harder to reach from now on!\\"<br /><br />Thank you Colleen Hoover, I needed this book!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez reminds us of Bob Dylan in this CD, yet it is music all his own.  This music from  the early 70's finally available to a wider audience.  It is so worth hearing!  Too bad it was lost for long but so good it was found!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was a gift from Amazon due to the delay of the release of Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled (10-Disc Limited Edition Six-Movie Collector's Set). I want to thank the folks from Amazon...They Rock!  It's a nice Blu-Ray /DVD combo which is perfect if you don't need 3-D or a digital copy. I've review films before, but there's nothing I could add to the Avengers that you haven't already read or seen for yourself. If you haven't watched it with Joss Wedon's comments going on, do it! DO  IT  NOW!  He's makes some really excellent comments and tells some good stories. I saw it 7 times in the theaters and 81 times at home. The Only thing I would Change is I would have liked to Have Captain America do a little more damage to Loki in Germany. Loki tossed him around a little too much for my tastes. Remember, Capp defeated the HULK and is worthy enough to lift Thor's Hammer, so I would have preferred to not have him bounced about like a rag doll. That said, Everyone should own a copy of this movie and this version is perfect for every level of collector...or for a non-collector. I just want to say this last bit: If they put Spider-Man in Avengers 2, I want Toby ! (I know that is not likely to happen, but if it did...Cool!)
B008BDZOZY|5.0|I have never heard such a mesmerizing use of brass in any setting. A perfect blend of the unmistakable genius of David Byrne's writing, insanely awesome lyrics, and brass-fascinating, exciting, and always interesting. St. Vincent has THE voice to perfectly complement the bold, brass sound. Powerful song writing meets brass band (TUSK, anyone?); it has been too long since brass was this prominent in a pop album, and it works.
0316228532|2.0|It's like Rowling was trying to get as far away as possible from the HP series as possible. Like when a child star poses for Playboy as soon as she turns 18.<br /><br />And this is definitely a book for those over 18.<br /><br />It's a nitty, gritty book about small town politics and what goes on behind closed doors for all those involved, including the children.<br /><br />And that 1/2 a star came from part six; that's what really saved it for me. I bought this as soon as it came out and only just finished it today. I had to force myself through every page.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|I enjoy the happy, sad and heartwarming stories of this movie. Something for everyone who likes this type of movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is wondering! Had my heart racing toward the end I never would have guessed all that with jo! I kinda wished it would have ended differently!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an outstanding series. I am a closet zombie movie addict and this series is great. Great plots, great effects, overall a 5 star series.
0307383415|1.0|My GOD how did a moron like this get to be president?..First 6 years of school was in a Muslim school( he wasnt even raised in America)...both parents were MARXIST...his father was a drunk womanizer who had kids by three women and killed a man...his mother was sexually promiscuous America hater who dragged OBAMA all over the world chasing her men...she even got mad at one husband for starting a business that actually made a profit. His Grandparents were far left loons who raised him in a \\"church\\" that had communists on the board of deacons...his \\"black\\" mentor in Hawaii was a leader in the local communist party. Obama himself hated America to the point he wouldnt even wear an American flag on his lapel till it looked like the liberal media was going to MAKE him President.  He had years in school he claimed were just a haze because of his Drug habits. And he wont even release his college grades because everyone will see he only made it thru affirmative action. The people that support trash like OBAMA need to get OUT OF MY COUNTRY NOW. If a second revolution comes like I think it will..we will run you out of it anyway...like we did the first group of TORIES in the first revolution.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I purchased all 3 available movies for my &#34;dancer&#34; and I to view together. We have a good time &#34;bonding&#34; over dance, ,music, the arts.  We have a blast.  She Shares her dreams and her thoughts of her and for her during these times.  The best time to get to know her better is to the music and beat of what and who she is.  That also includes her ballet as she is an accomplished point dancer.<br /><br />It makes me feel good that she can see how the different dancing melds together to become something fantastic.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|then I guess it's not a bad book.  I found myself caring about the characters and I enjoyed watching them evolve and fall in love.  I felt the abundance of sex scenes to be a bit much. I didn't feel as if they were completely vital to the story.  I understand why some of them were necessary to the plot, but not all of them.  So if the intimate scenes don't shock or bother you, this story isn't bad. I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I know but I'm not sorry I read it, especially based on it's role in pop culture.  I'm at the very least &#34;in the know&#34;.
B004529NKC|5.0|Again,. this movie is awesome.  Watching the moviews in  a Marathon sweep was really fun and my dancer explained and &#34;slo-mo&#34; showed me how it is done.  A great time with my teenager!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I got the first season for a friend for christmas and she loved it. I've never seen the show, but she seems to love it.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching this with my daughter.  She being a dancer as well it was a good time just talking about the moves.
0525478817|5.0|The book was amazing and it got me addicted to John Green. I love his work. the book was the appropriate amount of comedy and realistic moments. And I cried for the last like ten chapters, but in a good way. It shows how connected to the characters you can get.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|While many people don't like Dave Mustaine because of his outspoken, though protected by the 1st Amendment, views, this book gives an excellent insight into the life of making it in Rock n Roll. Dave is brutally honest about himself and his hard path to making it to the top. His candid accounts of life on the streets as a young teen to life on the road in the band add to his self-destructive behavior. In the end he finds salvation through several things. When you're faced with losing everything, you finally wake up.<br /><br />Loved this book and having my teenage son read it too. He's an aspiring musician and we have Megadeth in common, among other things. Dave is an inspiration to us both. As a mom, I'm glad to have this book as a teaching tool for my son.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was different than any other thing I've ever read in my life. The book made me blush during the majority of the content, but there was more of a story than i expected. everyone at work read it and we all chatted about who we thought was the best representation of Christian and we made inside jokes about the book for a long time after. Good read to share with the girls.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I like Colin Farrell as an actor  he reminds me of Sean Connery at a younger age.  I expect to see him behind the camera's if he hasn't already done so. All my friends who like sifi
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I watched the first 6 seasons of the show on netflix but when the 7th season was on tv, it wasn't on netflix yet. I watched the first episode on amazon and it was a pretty cheap option.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade doesn't miss a beat; the concert has all her classics. Can't miss for any Sade fan. It is one of the best dvd concerts we own.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|The diction and the story line of the novel is so amazing, The Darcy/Elizabeth chemistry is amazing and great for any romantic reader.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I have this on VHS as well. An absolute classic in my book. I'm a fan of Spielberg. I don't think there is a movie of his that I haven't liked.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I reviewed the part 1 dvd and said that i waited for it to go on sale for like $4 and i think it's a great deal. It was the only one i had missing from the collection
B000VS6R26|5.0|I got this when it was first released on VHS (went to see it as well its opening night at our local theater) and it was played quite a bit. A classic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know that it seems like a stretch, but I've never been more in love with a book trilogy except harry potter. I love the metaphor and the way Collins makes it seem like this could really happen. I liked the first book best.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I got this when it was first released on VHS. I'm a fan of all who starred in this great movie. It's touching, it's comedic, it's suspenseful, it's romantic.
B00015YVD6|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. it's such a classic with young tom hanks. I love mermaids and it's such a great movie.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I'm acquiring all of my favorites that I currently have on VHS on DVD or BluRay as I find them. I'm a child of the '80's and this is one of my all time favorites from that decade.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I waited for the dvd to go on sale for like $4 and it was such a good deal. I love the movie and the series and I have been collecting movies and this was one that i didn't have.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I got this when it was first released on VHS and I wore it out. Watched everyday, I'm not kidding. It was and still is my most favorite movie of all time.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Obviously, this is an errotica book. Don't complain about how dirty or inappropriate the books is, because it's not like it's a secret what the book is about. It's about this guy's BDSM relationship. I just find it annoying that people are annoyed with how graphic it is. Okay, minirant over. Sorry, lol. The book wasn't as good as the first, but I still thought it was good.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|The book is way better than the movie but this movie is a must see! The movie is more of a romance ghan an action but I promise you'll love it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is the besterest app I have EEEVVVEEERRR had and I have alot of awsome apps!!!!!!! I luv it. I toataly recomend it if you're not sure try the free version it will give you the basic idea of the game GET THIS APP NNOOOOOWWWWW:-)
B005LAII8A|5.0|This is the only movie I have ever went to the theater 2x's to see.... It's done very well although the ending kicks you in the butt. If  you don't get all hung up on the time travel conundrum.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I know some people may be taken aback at the content of this book. As usual J.K. Rowling writes a beautiful story woven with many characters. This is not a kids book. This is a book that could easily be someone's reality. No character is sainted. Everyone is flawed. It was thought provoking and sad. I loved every bit of it.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I'm not a die hard Deftones fan by any stretch, having only rocked out as a teenager to their early releases,  This is an amazingly well put together album and if you are a fan of previous Deftones albums you will not be disappointed in this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|&#34;&#34;I want you to keep them open...because I need you to watch me give you the very last piece of my heart.&#34;<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews as I am a hopeless writer, but for this book I want to, problem is my heart is still in my mouth and I can't formulate the words... I wish there were more than 5 stay I could give this book!<br /><br />Hopeless took me on a journey that had me in tears, laughter and everything in between! It broke my heart and then sewed it back together, a book that will never leave me and I'm sure I will read time and time again!<br /><br />Thank you Colleen Hoover for sharing your amazing talent with us mere mortals :)&#34;
B000092WD8|1.0|bought this movie from movie mars,when i recived it it would not play  because it was a region 2 dvd they can only be played in unitedkingdom and germany dvd players.  if i would have been aware of that i would not have bought it.tried to return had to pay to send back and then they kept half the money that was paid and didnt reimberse me for the shipping who buys dvds that cant be played on a standard dvd player.and movie mars and i are in the same state. felt like i was ripped off but its ok because it will never happend again at least by movie mars.  message to the people beware when buying some people ar out to scame
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Watch this and you'll know why they are the best rock & roll band of all times.  The best Christmas present I've ever had. I've been a fan of Led Zep, Plant & Page, and Robert Plant for over 30 years. I have the Song Remains the Same, Led Zeppelin (2003) and No Quarter dvd's. This newest is the best. Contrary to previous reviews I found the editing fine; not too quick at all. Great recording, awesome performance.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I love this book. I learned so much about how I behave affects my dogs behavior. It also has helped me with my volunteer work at our Humane Society.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is also just fun and lots of time can pass when you really get into it to win. I love it!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|The trailer looked good but I had heard very little about the movie and didn't think it did very well at the theaters.  However, after watching I think it was one of the best movies I've seen lately.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this as it really is a good time filler. This game really makes me think, and keeps me from becoming bored when I travel. Thanks for a fun game.
B009O2XY12|2.0|It had some glitches which made playing it kind of stressful. Concept was good, just not delivered very well though.
B00846REIS|4.0|At first it caught my attention but as I read more and more into the story I became more and more disappointed. There was so many similarities between the two it threw me off my interest. I wish I would of read these books before the fifty trilogy.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Tracey rarely disappoints and no exception here ! Her covers of Hard Candy Christmas & Sister Winter are nothing less than stellar, Bravo !
B003L77GRO|5.0|Given as a gift to a true Dexter fan and they loved it.  Would highly recommend it to a fan.
0316069434|4.0|Harry's back and in fine form. Can't wait for his next work. My only knock is that I get thru it too fast, would like it to take a little longer !
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven is one of the most moving and powerful books I have ever read. From the very first page I found myself self totally engrossed in Eben's amazing experience and I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.  I have been a strongly spiritual person for quite some time and this book helped to reaffirm the importance of letting go of fear and focusing my energy on the relationships with those who matter in my life.  This book is a great fit for many belief systems and reminds us all to be good to each other.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All in all, my specific reasoning regarding my personal ratings resolve down to the engrossing pull of both characters in the story, the igniting flame between Ana and Christian blossoming into something more than expected, specifically of their particular arrangement. All the while finding one's self encouraging both Ana and Christian as they discover their deep sensual desires for one another while searching for an opt to depict their deeper longing feelings of unknown love to themselves as individuals and to each other as companions. I have fallen in love with both Ana and Christian. One exquisite story of a novel. I am left yearning to finish the story of both Ana and Christian's inexperience, unexplainable, love for one another. I would recommend this thrill if a novel to any of whom may be searching for a good read of love, loss, and desire.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|as mentioned in title this app does not work with Epsom 520. there are other Epsom models that are avsilabe to work with... just not this one.  I wish that Epson had a kindle app available.
B00992CF6W|4.0|A really good game, it's a little high dollar, but other than that a good game. Another bad thing is that you can't choose flat world for building big houses. Please add that for Creative mode!
1401234542|5.0|So I didn't know too much of the back story going into this but honestly you really don't need to despite what the other reviews are saying.<br /><br />As long as you know who Hal Jordan is and how he got his powers, your set.<br /><br />All in all, Geoff Johns does a great job and this is definitely a must read for anyone into Green Lantern.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|The book itself was excellent and on the kine was flawless. I had no issues with the book and actually prefer to read kn the kindlefire.
B00003000M|5.0|I purchased this CD because I had never seen this CD.  Once I played this CD man the mix's with other singer are great.  If you can get this CD do so. You will LOVE IT.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 for free omg git it it's almost better  then all the apps in the app store the people who don't like this app the haters (:
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Just what can you say &#34; To boldly go where no man has gone before&#34;  waiting on the next one coming out in 2013 this is the year for STAR TREK.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I just couldn't put it down... I look forward to reading Crossed... yet disappointed that the saga is almost complete
B0099114WO|2.0|I kept waiting for the movie to get better.  Very slow.  Boring. And pretty unbelievable. Tough to fix a marriage that has been bad for years in one week of once a day sessions.
B0094K1K42|5.0|I love this movie. If people go into it understanding it's a black comedy and critical of small town life. the character is not lovable and isn't \\"redeemed\\" by the end of the movie; she is who she is and doesn't change for the people of her small-time town. If you want that, go see \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a funny game to play if you are 9 or 10 becuse if is about surfing and that is fun to do.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Relevant. Well documented, clinically. Written to appeal to the general population by acceptable to the healthcare professional. I highly recommend that anyone interested in their own health and that of their family read this book and pass it on!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Perfect, thank you for a great review of Bob Marley's Life.  It was a beautiful depiction of a man behind the music I love.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|It's rare to find an album where you love every track. In my opinion, Night Visions is wonderful, and I look forward to many more albums from Imagine Dragons!!
0062202081|5.0|This book is so flawless. I love that Justin wrote it for us. I would highly reccomend this book! :)
B00196YNWU|4.0|Nice story, our kids watched it when small, now the grandchildren enjoy it.  The first attempt to watch on Amazon video stopped with 10 minutes to go and wouldn't restart....just froze up. Couldn't find any contact number to find out what the issue was.  Tried again a few days and ran without incident until completion.  Next time probably will just buy the DVD and not use Amazon video....but the musical is worth getting.
B005CWRB44|5.0|THis little flashlight gives off so much better light and I can use it as a spot light when driving Hey Hey rides at a Yogi Bear's Jellystone park.  We do see some deer during the ride.  Makes a better light than my 3 cell mag. light I used to carry.  Only thing bad is its so small I suggest you attatch a lanyard to it.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|My contacts wears with time, but it is expected if I plug it in and out all the time. The wire that attaches is a bit flimsy, so can be pulled off a keychain if you man handle your keychains lol
0784010528|4.0|The only way it could have been better is if the package cover was unopened.  My husband loved it and was really surprised because this movie (The Doors) is hard to find!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I loved the intrigue. It keep me trying to figure out the end. John is one of my most enjoyable writers.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Great case at a good price! Easy to handle and fits the Kindle nicely. The case was perfect for an 11 year old.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A friend recommended Brandon Sanderson about the time this book came out. I loved it. The characters and the fantasy is like no other I've read before. The characters had deep emotion and some conflicted. The fantasy of creatures and powers were spectacular. I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I think this book is a great way to get children reading. Most already know the classic fairy tale stories, so reading about them in a new light with a plot and characters they can relate to makes this novel a must read. I am hopeful that Chris Colfer continues this story as a series. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and have purchased the book for my niece as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The ads can be annoying, and I don't understand why you'd want to deal a winning hand (kind of defeats the purpose of solitaire), but it's fun.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I truly loved the movie that I HAD to get this soundtrack though it's only highlights it's still worth it! Wish some of the other songs i loved was on this soundtrack thou! but I love it all the same! :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|I find myself moving my whole body to avoid hitting the trees. A testament to how engaging this game is.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Added this for my daughter but she could not add names and numbers unless she uploaded contacts and invited them to kik. Still looking for a Kindle text app for her.
B000087F6M|5.0|I know not everybody is a movie buff like me but when I see a movie that I enjoy , I like to watch it when I feel like it.  I saw this movie a long time ago and like it . I never saw it advertised before so I got it when I saw it advertised.  Its a fun movie with mild action but it will keep you interested .
034580404X|1.0|I am very disapointed in the amount of people who like this trilogy and the book itself. Mr Gray is an abusive stalker and should be in prison for the way he treats women. The romantic settings are all the same with not much creativity. I disliked this book and the idea of it immensly. No wonder so many women are being abused and treated unfairly if this is the kind of junk we enjoy and fantisize about.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This is the best Funny Drama series. I buy every Season because it is the best show on TV right now!
1452110581|4.0|If you have owned a cat you can relate to this book.  Very funny and quick read for cat lovers.
B0063IH60K|1.0|the download was corrupted--so I do not have the game to play, bummer. This is unacceptable for Amazon. I hope it will be resolved.
0385495323|5.0|Very well written in an easily followed narrative style which walks through the history of cyphers. Well described coding techniques for amateur cypher nuts.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|I was SOOO excited to see the movie after reading all five books. I guess if you watch the movie first, it's pretty cool, but since I read the books first, I was IMMENSELY disappointed. Since when is the story about finding the pearls? Where's Clarisse, and Ares, and Dionysus? Aren't the gods supposed to be wearing modern clothes? Annabeth is supposed to be blonde! That was the whole POINT--to make the really smart girl in the story BLONDE as a punch in the face to the dumb blonde stereotypes. Writers give their characters their features for a REASON!!! And where's that scene at the St Louis arch? That was one of my favourite scenes! And where's Annabeth's love of architecture? And there is NO romance between her and Percy in the FIRST BOOK!! And since when is she the warrior-girl? That's Clarisse! Who is a MAJOR character in the sequel, which I can't believe the people--not to mention the laws of the Universe and all that is good--are letting them do. Where's Kronos? The pact? The Big Three? Why is Persephone in the Underworld if it's SUMMER?! And don't even get me STARTED on the ages!!! Logan is older than Percy is NOW!!! In the movie he's, like, 17, but at the current moment (end of Mark of Athena) Percy is (to be precise) 16 years, 10 months, 1 week and 6 days old!!!! And that's not even ALL of it!!!! I know it's impossible and kinda boring for the movie to be EXACTLY like the book, but leaving out crucial parts, minor yet essential details that shape the story, and completely altering the plot line? I just HATE it when movie directors do that. The movie would've been WAY more successful if it actually FOLLOWED THE STORY!!!!<br />THEY RUINED MY FAVOURITE SERIES OF ALL TIME!!!!! THEY DESERVE TO BE IN THE FIELDS OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SINS!!!!!<br />*end of angry rant--I mean movie review*
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Never anticipated the ending. It was to finally read a book that wasn't totally predictable.
0670023329|5.0|Saw Shin on 60 Minutes and wanted to read his full story.  This book goes beyond the recovery of one man from the darkest of human experiences, one is compelled to empathy for all prisoners unjustly detained around the world.  I understand his sentiment that happiness is selfish when so many are in prison camps.  The book eludes to Shin coming to the knowledge of truth from holy scripture.  One verse I thought of throughout was &#34;fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell&#34; Matthew 10:28  No one can take from us the love and hope we have in Christ.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Language here means nothing this movie is amazing and I think if it was in english it would not have been as great. Well done.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|This book grasped the essence of great writing. It had suspense but not so much that I got fed up with waiting to discover the culprit, controversy and religion and secret societies,the perfect marriage create a book well worth reading. It made me love having a Kindle because i didn't want to leave the book at home when I went out.
B0065AO94W|5.0|I have not watched the movies (to see if they play well) yet but these are my two favorite movies besides Sleepy Hollow and The Corpse Bride. They came way before the expected delivery date and were not damaged in any way. I was stoked that I could get both movies together. Definitely buy this! You'll be happy ;)
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a cliffhanger at the end!  Could not put this down!  Mind blowing twists and even more personal this time!  Cannot wait to read book ,3!
0345803485|5.0|There was a lot of talk about how good fifty shades of grey is. and I tell you from reading it it is amazing I never thought I would like a book like that. But I do. And I just placed an order for the next 3. Ohh I am excited!! Can't wait to get them! ~ I Love Amazon~
B000O8OTNC|5.0|What can I say it easy to use and restores the edge on my throwing knives quickly ,  worth every penny.
0545265355|5.0|These books were better then I had expected them to be. My sisters were all reading a different boon from the trilogy, so I wanted to read them and see what the fuss was all about.<br />Well I did, I read all 3 of them in a week.<br />Very good books!
B00A2IUDO8|2.0|Not as bad as I expected but that's not really saying a lot. If you're a Family Guy fan, you might like it more, but I'm not a fan of that show.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|This book was great but  it didn't have the red slippers but I'm<br />going to read it again soon. Must read
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great story. So tired of movies overloaded with special effects and sexual innuendoes. Clint Eastwood is a favorite and love baseball. Great acting and dialog.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun Fun Fun I remember playing this game years ago at the county fair when you got to use quarters.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Really like this game.  You can \\"learn\\" what works and what doesn't and repeat the next time to complete the level. A lot less arbitrary than any of the \\"bird\\" games.  I hope the developers create more levels. I've topped out on the one's included and now crave more!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Great book. Read the other series that he wrote, The Kane Chronicles, and The Percy Jackson. I can not wait to finish this series!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is not at all the kind of book I would normally read, but after the Hunger Games I just had to read Catching Fire. Great book, very well written, and I really look forward to the next novel, see how this all ends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Highly recommend this book. You won't be disappointed. This book is an emotional rollercoaster of emotions and keeps you wondering.
B001AX7A7M|5.0|great
B008KNUKVI|5.0|These people are truly amazing!  Their sound is great. I was thoroughly engrossed by their mussic.  I recommend this product.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If you are looking for a book that is honest and real,for a book that will make you cry,laugh,and think all at the same time, then I urge you to pick up The Perks of Being a Wallflower. This book shows you a beautiful and unique perspective on life, with all its quirky simplicity and deep complexities. It will most certainly leave you smiling and cheering for life when it's over. Bravo to Stephen Chbosky!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is awesome. I got it on my kindle fire to re-read it and I loved it! Definitely one of Riordan's best! Ever since my friend recommended them to me, I have been hooked!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was so excite to get this game. Then, it turned out to be a Farmville type game. The urging to spend money to &#34;get ahead&#34; is obnoxious. No, I would not recommend it.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Neither funny nor cleaver. Its plain stupid and bad. Waste of time and waste of money. I just shows the limits of Macfarlene
B0086700CM|2.0|Our family loves this game.  We can play it on an ipod touch and a HTC EVO 4G and a Samsung Galaxy S. It runs smoothly on our 7&quot; Zeki tablet EXCEPT it doesn't tilt left and right to get the coins.  So my kids are completely bummed about it.  PLEASE FIX AND I WILL GIVE 5 STARS!
0446585041|1.0|First things first... I like Ellen and I have a great sense of humor.  So I thought that it would be a perfect fit.  Ellen must have something interesting to say and I'd love to hear her story.  I have watched her show from time to time and I think she is really funny and a great personality.  For this fact, I got this book with great expectations.  I have read many biographies and was hoping this would be one of them... boy was I surprised when I jumped into this book.  What a disappointment.  It is pure nonsense.  I have never read anything that has no value at all.  She babbles about anything jumping from one topic to another and each topic is full of predictable ridiculous one liners.  Not one chapter is serious.  It's so bad that you never know what to believe.  At first I thought it was written for children but with all the sexual innuendos it couldn't be true.  At times I found myself complaining out loud or saying, \\"get to the point\\"  but there is no point.  I'm sure people will buy this book for the same reasons i mentioned above and hopefully they will get some enjoyment out of it but I just got frustrated waiting for some sort of inspiration or a good story or life experience from her... what a waste of time.
B003AMEWMW|5.0|This little movie was a bit of nostalgic adult fun..Frances McDormand always does fine acting and Amy Adams is the perfect ditzy movie star.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|It was just plain uninteresting. I decided to read the first two because they were popular. Won't be getting the third.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|A memoir of great, sometimes even painful honesty, the story of Craig's journey from a sometimes brutal childhood in the school system of 70's Scotland to his eventual end as a success and citizen of America is truly awesome and inspiring. I'd recommend it to just about anyone.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Enjoyable movie..reasonably good plot and well acted movie.  Great Halloween change of pace.  Attractive cast that was well directed and moves at a good pace
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have never ever been disappointed with a Bloons TD game.  I've been a fan since the very first one.  This game is no exception!!  There are so many ways to customize your towers and gameplay.  With every tower there are two options for upgrade paths which is soo much fun!!  Stop reading reviews and get this game immediately!!  It is worth every penny of the price!  I can't wait for more games for my Kindle from Ninja Kiwi!!
0763644765|5.0|I got this for my toddler when she started to learn about potty training.  It's a really cute and fun book.  Even now at three we still quote parts of it &#34;tinkle tinkle toot&#34; and yelling UNDIES!  Fun!
1439170916|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee<br /><br />\\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is a literary achievement of science.  It's an enlightening journey through the history of cancer through the eyes of a coming-of-age oncologist.  A beautifully written book that treats this complex topic of cancer with the utmost care and respect while providing the reader valuable insights into the scientific quest to eradicate or control this insidious disease.  This outstanding 608-page book is broken out into six major parts: 1. \\"Of blacke cholor, without boyling\\", 2. An Impatient War, 3. \\"Will you turn me out if I can't get better?\\", 4. Prevention is the Cure, 5. \\"A Distorted Version of our Normal Selves\\", and 6. The Fruits of Long Endeavors.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Outstanding accomplishment of literary science. Extensive research of cancer and conveyed to the masses in an enlightening readable fashion. Kudos!<br />2. Engaging and humane prose.<br />3. What sets this book apart is the author's ability to interweave human stories into the biography of cancer thus achieving a perfect balance of humanity and science.<br />4. Great facts and fascinating scientific tidbits about cancer throughout this book.<br />5. Cancer...what it is, and the never ending scientific quest to eradicate or control it.<br />6. Cancer has many manifestations.  This book covers many of them through the eyes of the patients, scientists and doctors.  Leukemia and breast cancer, do get special attention.<br />7. Innate ability of Dr. Mukherjee to provide details with panache.<br />8. The history of the drugs developed to combat the many manifestations of cancer.  The history of the agencies, and support groups.  The scientists behind the design, development and deployment of the drugs.<br />9. Great quotes, \\"Cancer thus exploits the fundamental logic of evolution unlike any other illness. If we, as a species, are the ultimate product of Darwinian selection, then so, too, is this incredible disease that lurks inside us\\".<br />10. A look into the history of ancient diseases.  The progression (not always in a straight line either) of science as it relates to treating diseases.  The key discoveries that were instrumental to progress, anesthesia as an example.  The discovery of radium in 1902.<br />11. The history of organizations launched to fund research.  Special mention to the tireless efforts of Mary Woodard Lasker and Sidney Farber.<br />12. Conducting clinical research.  The trials and tribulations.  The various treatments and effects.  A lot of focus on chemotherapy.  The multidrug concoctions.  The reality of the results.  The tamoxifen trial.<br />13. The causes of cancer.  The various theories.  As an example a look into the somatic mutation hypothesis of cancer.<br />14. The quest to understand the biological behavior of cancer before going on an all out attack.  Fascinating stuff.<br />15. The quest to prevent diseases.  Many examples of historical cases: the \\"chimney-sweepers' cancer, tobacco, malaria, to name a few.  Find out the extreme experiment that put one scientist's own life at risk.<br />16. The history behind screening trials. Pap smears, mammography, the findings, and the lessons learned.<br />17. The insidious disease...AIDS.  Retroviruses.<br />18. The link between chromosomal changes and cancer. The causes.<br />19. Proto-oncogenes.  \\"Cancer was intrinsically loaded in our genome, awaiting activation\\".  The first cogent and comprehensive theory of carcinogenesis.<br />20. Understanding the progression of cancer. \\"Down to their innate molecular core, cancer cells are hyperactive, survival-endowed, scrappy, fecund, inventive copies of ourselves.\\"<br />21. The six rules that explain core behavior of more than a hundred types of tumors.<br />22. The three new Achilles' heels of cancer. The three essential ingredients for a targeted therapy for cancer.<br />23. The current biological and societal challenges ofcancer. The pathway disease.<br />24. Excellent links to notes.<br />25. The inclusion of a glossary and bibliography.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. At over 600 pages, it does require an investment in time.  Thankfully, it's time well invested.<br />2. Lack of charts and illustrations would have added value.  Could have been added to appendices to avoid disrupting elegant prose.<br />3. It can be an emotional read sometimes as the reader will find themselves invested in the lives of so many people...let's face it, we are talking about dealing with cancer.<br />4. Some readers will get lost among the many and recurring storylines.<br />5. The photographs would have added more value if they would have been inserted in the context of the narrative instead of a separate appendix.<br /><br />In summary, this is an outstanding and important book.  What sets this book apart is Dr. Mukherjee's ability to weave multiple storylines into a fascinating narrative about the history of cancer with just the right touch of humanity.  This was an ambitious book and I can only imagine how daunting a quest this was but the author succeeds and as a result we the readers benefit from the knowledge and wisdom.

1419702238|5.0|My son loves this series and this was the only one he didn't have. He finished it in one day and loved it! He has read several times since.
B00004S5TK|5.0|I really enjoyed viewing this DVD.  However, I missed the fact this DVD was not only made for viewing in the USA, but also for other countries.<br /><br />My computer had to play the DVD on a different drive (I do not own a DVD player) and my computer would only make the change to the differenct drive a few times.  I was worried my computer would no longer play DVD's make for watching in the<br />USA only if I kept watching this DVD over and over again, otrherwise, I would keep the DVD for continued viewing.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Season One was more thrilling and less gory.  This season is more slasher-esque, though some of it is still intriguing.  It is interesting to see how the same cast has changed roles.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The remaining three members of Led Zeppelin were recently honored at the Kennedy Center.  I have one of their CD's on my IPod, but became interested in their concerts during the 12 years the four members performed.  It took a year for Jimmy Page<br />to restore and put together segments of the various concerts they performed.<br /><br />This is a two package DVD set of different sagments of some of their performances.  The chemistry of the four of them was phenomenal.  Each one of the four took a turn as the leader of their band.  When Robert Plant was recruited by Jimmy Page to<br />sing with band, Led Zepplin, he was singing blues in clubs around London.  Robert Plant recommded his long time boyhood frind,  drummer John Bohham, to be a member of the band.  John Paul Jones was a recording musician and when he heard Jimmy Page was forming a new band, he asked Jimmy Page if he could be a part of it.  John Paul Jones has remarkable talent for playing both the bass guaitar and keyboards. The songs Led Zepplin play are a combination of blues songs sung by the slaves in the \\"old South\\" and heavy metal and hard rock.  This combination of sound was innovated for its time and, at first, was critized, but when they began having armies of fans following them from concert to concert, even their harshest critics took notice<br /><br />At first their songs sound harsh and unforgiving, but after listening to them one begins to hear the harmony of the four members.  Robert Plant's wailing minics Jimmy Pages' guitar moans and you can hear the two shirking in tandom over Bonham and Jones' racing percision (this is part of a quote from their album, \\"Mothership,\\") I have downladed their \\"Mothership\\" CD's to my Ipod and I never tire of listening to it.  This is one of my favorite CD's in the collection of classic rock CD's I have downloaded to my Ipod.<br /><br />When viewing the band in concert, they are unpretentous and no one member wears clothes that put him a part from the other members.  It seems they just grabbed whatever was in their closet to wear on stage.  In fact, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page wear the same shirt on different occassions. They look like they just got together for a music session even though they are playing in front of hundreds of fans.  They had their own jet and flew to different countries giving concerts one after another.  They were like mad mem playing concerts and recording albums.  They recorded four albums in the twelve years they were Led Zepplin. Their songs are an echo-soaked mass of acousitic and electric guitars and Plant's singing in the double time break (this is also a partial quote from the pamphlet that is written for their \\"Mothership\\" album).<br /><br />As both Led Zepplin and the Beattles are English bands, the media keeps asking members of Led Zepplin how they compare themselves to the Beattles.  Their is no comparison.  The music of both bands are like night and day.  Unfortunately Led Zepplin did not evolve as the Beattles did due to the loss of their drummer; at which time, they discontinued as \\"Led Zepplin.\\"

B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor swift is one of the few young artists that writes from the heart, publishes number one hits all the time, can be looked up to by the younger generation, and doesn't end up going the Linsay Lohan route. Support her every effort to entertain.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A Really fun and challenging game for both kids and adults. Makes you look for ways to do more damage with one bird.
B009738XXM|5.0|Great listening. She has what it takes and is going far.<br />Purchased easily, and download worked like a charm. I'll by more.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game.  Lots of fun and very challenging.  I wish it was longer.  I can't wait for the next version.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My son and I have been fans for a few years and the new season is just as exciting as the old ones!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever!!! I love it and can't wait to read the next one!!!! I can't wait for the movie!!!!!!!!
B00632HWOG|2.0|The mail app works fine for Kindle but the Kindle doesn't need the special app as it can already get Yahoo mail. I was really hoping that with the app I'd be able to use my calendar. That's why I'm only giving it 2 stars.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game is amazing,  however twice I bought bars only to lose them through lag clicking. I will not spend money again in this game untill a confirm purchase window is put in place. I was very disappointed to buy something then lose it not once but twice now.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. While the story line has been done several times  The character development  was excellent and story line kept you wondering if it was going to be all hearts and flowers then a big twist.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I rented this movie with my aunt thinking it would be cheesey and Glee-like (a show which I have never watched).  Actually thought it was super cute and funny!!!
B004S82OAE|5.0|Author really shows depth in his knowledge about the subject. Narrative is a little confusing at times. Get a Packet Tracer prog to actually use the console commands in absence of an actual CISCO switch.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like choosing card color &amp; background -Able to chose level of difficulty.  Classic spider game we all know &amp; love.  Ads are annoying
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Very fun game. I like that you draw your own characters and the interaction with plants and animals. The graphics are good for a stick figure game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was really funny. It's great for kids with the ages 9-12. Great book! Another one from Jeff Kinney, and a good one!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This MOBA is very amazing to be done so well on a portable device (in my case a kindle fire)  and the fact that the game is free is even better! My only gripe is that like most games on touch screen the controls are a bit picky. Don 't let that stop you from trying this game out though!
B005LAII8A|5.0|Haven't watched this yet.  But I have ordered 100's, if not 1000's of dvd's from Amazon.  I've only had 2 that I have had to return and I have always received the replacements very the next day.  Amazon truly backs its products and they have the best prices in town.  I have made a few mistakes in the past, of buying dvd's from other places because they were cheaper, only to find out that those were bootleg copies.  So Amazon is the only place online that I purchase from anymore.
089381525X|5.0|Salgado's portraits capture the notion that &#34;eyes are the window to the soul&#34;.<br />This coffee table book is a must have.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I must admit I knew this movie would be a disappointment but I was bored.  Alas, I am even more disappointed as now my suspicions have been confirmed.  This really is a bad movie.  If there is a record for the number of times the F word has been used in a movie, I am quite sure Magic Mike would be the frontrunner.  Is it called writing when ever other word is profane.  I think a 16 year boy could have written a better script.  Channing Tatum's body is nice but skip the movie it is not worth it.
1451695195|2.0|I have read much better NDE books...very vague, and hard to believe. There are not many details about NDE experience  but<br />more information about the Doctors education.
B0080K3G4O|1.0|This book is a recipe for failure, not only it clearly shows the way for failure but also tells you to accept it and like it. In the last chapter, as a conclusion, it even tells you to start preparing for death...
B007SSDBBM|5.0|This movie  is a light hearted romantic comedy that has a nice message of what you always think you need is not always the truth.<br /><br />Great film!
075666733X|5.0|I have read other reviews which point out there are some errors in the book. I don't have that level of scientific knowledge to comment there. But what I can say is that I bought this for my son and he enjoyed it so much he read the whole thing. So did we. The graphics are beautiful. Informative. Thoughtfully laid out. Accessible.
B004LSJCJM|3.0|It seems to me that Joe has changed his style a bit.  He appears to be more centered on his vocals than his great guitar abilities.  I enjoyed his past CD's more than the more recent ones.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It was a little drawn out in spots, but still a good read. Jack Reacher is a very good character.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I love it! Harvey Rabbit and Jimmy Stewart were favorites from my child hood. I was so glad I was able to purchase it.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This book was way too long and way too much information. It was repetitive to me. DeMille has much better novels out.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Eastwood, as usual, does a superb job of acting and directing. He brings the human side into what could have been a bland movie. The two main supporting actors did a wonderful job. The little twist at the end is worth waiting for, and it is appropriate. Good for the whole family, good for the sports fan, and good for parents; to remind them of what parenting is about.
B0000549B0|5.0|One does not necesarily have to appreciate a successful stage play conversion to this 1950 film starring Jimmy Steward (Academy Award nomination performance), Josephine Hull (Received Academy Award for her performance), and many other recognizable character actors to enjoy this film.  A fantasy plot of a 'pooka' (fairy) in rabbit form who befriends Jimmy Stewart's character and spooks other disbelieving relatives, society acquaitances and sanitorium hospital staff.  A light hearted and fun look at the social stigmas and bias associated with unconventional, harmless adult behavior.
B008M34INW|4.0|Typical Gibson movie of action, and more action. The Mexican jails are not much worse than was portrayed. Gibson, again does know how to do an action film. Would not recommend for kids 13 and under due to language, violence, drugs, and sexual situations.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I was so excited to see that i was able to purchase Dexter by episodes when I wanted. I sure did beat having to go out and search for the seasons/episodes I missed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have not been able to put it down...I would not normally be into this type of book! I am so intrigued by why Christian is the way he is...can't wait to find out!
B005D63ICI|5.0|Same as previous seasons! Fantastic!!!! I love having to be able to find just the episodes I missed out on. Couldn't be any happier!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I usually don't rate a book five stars but this is an exception. This book tugged at my heart. It was so real and raw, the emotions that pour out of you are unthinkable. Dean Holder was by her side the entire time. I like that for once the male character, Holder, didn't screw her I've  like in most romance books. This book was fabulous from page to page. There are twists and turns that keep you exhilarated. A must read for a book lover!!:)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The author weaves the magic right into this story . Alive with historical facts blended right in as well .
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game nothing expires, and when you go back in at your own leisure  nothing is expired or spoiled you don't have to throw things out and start again
1400067820|5.0|I'm going to keep this fairly short. I'll work on the assumption that you've read or are at familiar with some of Taleb's earlier books such as Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan. He expressly states that this book is a culmination of his earlier writings. Expanding on his prior writings, Taleb goes after many current orthodoxies - financial, medical, higher education, political and social. He believes that ancient wisdom and philosophies are frequently better grounded in reality because they have been tested  over time. If you, like me, are growing increasingly skeptical of current trends including the new world financial architecture, political culture, medical treatment, and higher education, then you will probably find this book interesting. If, to the contrary, you are invested in and largely satisfied with current politics, financial systems, medicine and higher education, then Taleb's analyses will not be reassuring and you may find the book disagreeable.<br /><br />What's antifragile? Nature is his main example of a system that responds well to change. The Hydra is his mythological example of antifragility. Cut off a Hydra's head and two more grow back.<br /><br />Taleb writes with a great deal of confidence. Be prepared for this.<br /><br />He cites many ancient philosophers, medical practitioners and other ancient, and sometimes largely unknown, authors, including a number of Arab sources,for wisdom not currently accepted and practiced. He believes that ancient wisdom tested across time and in different cultures are often better suited to withstand the inevitable Black Swans  than current orthodoxies.<br /><br />I recommend the book highly. On a personal note, I plan to read Seneca, whom Taleb cites frequently, in 2013.<br /><br />A friend of mine from Bishmizzine, Lebanon, speculates that Taleb's interest in Black Swans may arise from his family's house being blown up in a Lebanese political dispute. He mentions this event in his book.

1932735410|5.0|After reading the PMBOK line by line to prepare for the exam, I felt panicking because my learning style is not memorization. Yes, I do realize that the PMBOK isn't a textbook.  But I didn't know where to start - there were so many PMP Exam Prep books out there.  I picked the RMC book based on the reviews and comments online.  The book met my expectation as Rita didn't expect me to memorize a whole lot.  I set the PMBOK aside and used the RMC book exclusively.  I actually found myself enjoying the materials, and the subjects.  I am sure RMC isn't the only good book.  It is the only good book I know about Project Management - beyond the goal of preparing for the PMP exam.<br /><br />First of, Rita explained the concepts thoroughly. In this book, Rita actually teaches the readers about *good* project management techniques to follow, and *bad* project management techniques to avoid. The examples are clear.  The exercises really test the readers' knowledge.  I found and marked areas where my current organization could benefit from Rita's instructions.  I was able to utilize the knowledge learned from this book in my projects immediately.  To be specific, common sense such as Project Charter, Project Requirements, Stake Holder Analysis, Risk Analysis, Resource Analysis are mandatory for projects to be grounded and positioned to be successful.<br /><br />If you want to pass the PMP without relying on rote memorization, this book will help you.  You will also have an added benefit of enjoying the topics as you go through it.  Having said that, I am sure there are other good books out there. This book happened to be my first choice and I loved it.  Good luck to you on your PMP Exam.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I am bringing in 2013 to Celbration Day !!! I have been lucky enough to have seen Zep live twice and Page and Plant 3 times. Bottom line is Jason is UNREAL with Pagie Plant and Jonesy. If you are a die hard Led Head like me then you must get this set. To all Led Heads you know no matter how many times you hear these songs you can never get enough of live Zep. Zep was and forever will be a LIVE Band first. When I die I want Zep played at my Burial. Happy New Year !!!!!!!!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|A beautiful collection of highlights from the 2012 movie - this is a great soundtrack! My only disappointment was that some of the tracks are missing but I understand why all couldn't be included. A must have for all fans of the film!!
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST OUT THERE! The new songs are amazing!!! Also the 14 music videos complete this album! I highly Suggest you get this album if your a Kelly Clarkson Fan! You'll Fall in love instantly!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I recently watched this with 2 kids, ages 8 and 11, and 2 adults. I was an enjoyable video for all. I was impressed with the visual quality and production.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|This is an AMAZING ALBUM! I Love all the great hits!! I Love the Music videos it comes with it too! The Fun House Freak Show Edition ones are cool! I highly recommend you get this Deluxe CD/DVD it WILL NOT Dissapoint!
B006L4MWVE|3.0|Synopsis: a group of teenage schoolkids are taken to an isolated island by a totalitarian half-fascist, half-communist government and forced to kill each other until there is only one left alive.<br /><br />The violence is very graphic, and this is a contrast to The Hunger Games; this is due to the different genders writing each books. It is always difficult to render a proper adaptation of a very large book with a large number of characters, but even so, there are ways. Unfortunately, the director fails to do a very good job at that. Sometimes even the camera angles are wrong in that they fail to capture a character's reaction at the proper time, opting instead for wide angles. Another thing, I had no emotional connection with most of the characters, even the main ones; frankly, I didn't care if they lived or died, I just wanted to see the action. Granted that the book went into greater detail about them, the director could have easily worked something in in order to establish empathy.<br /><br />I have another criticism, one that also applies to the book and that consists in that although several of the characters sustain injuries, they nevertheless undertake physical activity which would be strenuous in normal circumstances. I guess that incongruity can be written off as the stamina of youth and/or adrenalin, but even so, it felt unreal.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|a nice easy game as always at some point you need freinds to complete missions which I worst thing in all mobile games
B0096HIEE2|4.0|Good movie.  Good acting.  Very enjoyable. What more do you want me to say.  I enjoyed it. This is stupid to require a certain number of words.  I said what I wanted to with the first 3 comments.  Says it all..........
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is Awesome. I am a zombie fanatic. I love this show. Now I can watch it whenever I want. I also got season 1.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was the #1 santa gift for my 9 year old son - nothing surpassed this surprisingly tiny package .
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I bought this as a christmas gift for someone else. I want one for myself. This thing is really cool looking.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|More twists and turns than the Blue Ridge Parkway. Keeps you guessing until the very end. Don't miss this gem! Grisham books keep getting better and better
B000VMFDW2|4.0|this book is for a very small selection of readers.  The book tells a story that is gruesome and brutal.  The story is about a young US Marine with an honest portral of war.  If any criticism is to be made, the book is to honest.  The young Marine talks about being scared and the horrible stench of the dead to excessive degrees but I have no doubt of the truth in that.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Best drama series since Jack Bauer on the hit tv show 24. Cant wait for season two to be out on demand!
B007YOC4RW|4.0|I got turned on to Joe Bonamassa when I saw him in concert on a Public Television Station. He is a wonderful guitarist/musician.  I hope I get the opportunity to see and hear him perform live.  One review mentions the quality of the recording, and I have to agree.  The compression does compromise the quality.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great story and very creative. Not too violent. I read this before the movie and it was interesting to see what Suzanne Collins had in store for me.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Unforgiven is a wonderful western.  The storyline is great, the acting was wonderful, and it has moments of comedy as well.  It is one of my favorite westerns.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|We bought these movies as a Christmas gift.  We could not find them in local stores so turned to Amazon.com.  We were able to get the movies at a good price, in very good condition.
B0015AARJI|5.0|very good experience, I recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time.<br /> the product was exactly the that I wanted
1781163243|5.0|I love this books. excellent art- i have spent hours longingly looking through the book. Love it. Treasure it. :)
B00322PK2G|5.0|very good experience, I recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time.<br /> the product was exactly the that I wanted
1595827684|5.0|Awesome book. Really love it. Only complaint is that there is next to nothing on my favourite character Liara. And all the mass effect 3 stuff is just a larger version of the book you get with the collectors edition. Shame. but still worth it.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|So many empty nesters can relate to this movie!! Very funny. Will give you something to talk about with your spouse!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I remember reading My Side of the Mountain as a child and deciding at that moment that I hated survival books. The Hunger Games though is so much more than a book of survival. It may be a young adult book but it has a very adult storyline with adult emotions. It seems impossible to not get caught up in the characters, to feel what they feel and cry for them even when they are too strong to do so on their own.  I'll be going online immediately to download the second book.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This simply was not funny. Let me save you $1.99 - not even worth $1.99! The ethnic humor was not funny and I saw no need for it (and I'm not Jewish). The sex and drug humor got obnoxious and repetitive. Don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that the scene with the human poop on the floor wasn't remotely funny. Sad to say, the best part of this movie was the trailer - and normally I really like Mark Wahlberg in movies.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's just what I ordered and the price is right. I got one for myself and one as a gift for someone else.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I think this game is a blast. I love how it challenges you to do better. It is a fun and exciting game for everyone to play. Great job on this game.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I am pleased with this case, but I wish I had bought one that would stand its own....so I will purchase another case later. But if you do not want it to stand on its own...this is a nice case.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|I know just about all of the songs on it, so it is the CD of hers that I wanted.
1419705849|5.0|Bought this book as a gift....and my Grandson who is 10 was delighted. Before the end of his visit over the holidays...he had finished the book...I love any book that incourages reading.
B004EK926K|2.0|Very boring and hard to watch. Don't spend your money on this. Opt for one of the classic Dicken's versions instead.
B00138CYD4|5.0|The title says it all. Among the genius, Carlos Santana, one of his best! If you only get one Santana album, this should be your choice.
B0086700CM|5.0|for a free app,  this game is amazing.!!!!!!! it runs very smooth and the controls r extremely easy. it will easily destroy hundreds of hours of your life&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Has more than enough adjustable compartments.. Like the look and feel of it. Great buy!! Preferred this over a side on bag.
1476719071|2.0|They say you are not supposed to judge a book by the cover, however, I will admit that is one of the first things that drew me to this book, was in fact the cover art.  Second, was the RAVE reviews I am seeing online about the book...end result? I haven't the FOGGIEST idea where all the hype is coming from.<br /><br />In a nut shell the book sends the wrong message to all the influencial girls that may read this book.  If a guy is throwing punches at every man that looks in your general direction...he needs medication sweetheart, not a kiss and a hug.<br /><br />If a guy completely hulks out when you get into an argument with him and walk away...and he tries to stop you by pulling on your arms, legs, clothing, ect...well then he needs a pair of cuffs honey, not more of your attention.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this book, I personally thought there could have been a much better love story here than there was crime, violence, and controling actions.<br /><br />Leaves you feeling more like a battered wife, than it does swept off your feet.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A good sequel to Fall of Giants. The historical background from a common person's perspective sheds light on those turbulent times. Despite reams of first-hand accounts, the author's re-telling of the descent into barbarism of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia still manages to shock. A very good read but I enjoyed Fall of Giants more.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|John Carter, based on E. R. Burroughs famous Martian series, is not very accurate regarding the appearance of the various Martian beings, but keeps moving and holds one's interest.  The location scenery  (Utah) is quite stunning and the actors play their roles straight. I especially liked Lynn Collins' work as Dejah Thoris, the Martian princess.  The costumes and airships showed imagination n design.
B005FIO3PU|5.0|I bought this lamp and I'm very satisfied with its luminosity. Its work on USB or battery.<br />If you are looking for a good and cheap lamp. This is your choice.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Enjoyed the book immensely. Found myself wrapped up in their relationship. What book do recommend for the next read while waiting for third book? Already read Fifty Shades trilogy.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|It exceeded my expectations. I will be viewing it many times. Gary Cooper deserved to win an Oscar for this.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|this is a good movie and at a great price for all these formats i spent the same for this as i would have just for the digial copy on itunes
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|the plot is really well played and directed.  the acting is good and the action is amazing.  I own the movie and will watch it again.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I did not see this in the theater prior to ordering.  I took the advise of friends who loved this movie.  It is definitely a chick flick but entertaining non the less.  Channing Tatum is believable in the lead.  Mathew McCaunahey looks spectacular shirtless through the whole film!  Women will love this and men will be totally bored.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Hidden no longer. Thanks for movie and music. Hopefully more to come. Some producer in USA must give Rodroguez a contract. Don't let him go to South Africa for fame.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Every mother should watch this show with her daughter at least once a month.  It is by far the beat movie for little girls from Disney because it is about the relationship between a mother and her daughter, instead of the same ole story line, waiting for a Prince to rescue a girl
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Really a great album and something different from Eddie Vedder Some songs sound similar but all in all a great album
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it can't wait to read the next book, everyone should read this series, to be grateful if what they have!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|Surprised....I never imagined I would enjoy reading a book like this but it did keep my interest. I look forward to reading another one of her books.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Short but fun read.  This story has some real steam to it and what more could a girl ask for?
B007BDK3SS|1.0|kindle fire and it is all messed up. The game is upside down. I strongly suggests that you do not buy this app.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Had a few good laughs, story line somewhat predictable Reasonable entertaining definitely not something children should see but that should be self explanatory.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVED IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />it was so great<br />I recommend this to everyone who has the time to read this book
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Very bad language. Quit watching the movie after 20 minutes.This is not my type of comedy. Would not recommend movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first page. I couldn't bring myself to put it down and finished it in two days. The main character I feel like thinks just like me and so of course now I'm completely in love with Dean Holder and will be crying for the next few days because I miss him.... :(
0634022296|5.0|Having all the lyrics to all their songs and the guitar chords too,  taking lessons now so we can sing along
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Rock of Ages was a Christmas gift my daughter requested for Christmas because she saw it before and really loved it.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Just what my husband wanted, the next year's adventures of this series. Coming next? The Fifth Season as soon as he's finished this one!
B00782O7IY|5.0|The Artist was was a Christmas gift to my daughter and she loved it!  Her whole family really loved it.
0061124958|4.0|It is great! My sister and I had it when we were young and now we both have this copy to read to our children. The kids love it and my sister loves it and the memories that came along with it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've been in a sort of book slump lately because I've been so disappointed with the all of the cliche plots. Literally, every book is about a guy and girl who see each other from across the room and then boom! \\"insta-love\\", then there is some sort of conflict caused by miscommunication (biggest pet peeve), cue whiney heroine and unnecessary dramatics, and then they confess their undying love and everyone lives happily ever after. ANNOYING. However, I was pleasantly suprised to find out this was not the case with Hopeless. This book had well developed characters that I actually enjoyed reading about. Sky is definitely on my list of favorite heroines. She was a strong character with a great personality. And the main characters' relationship in this book was not mushy and sappy. The author took her time to develop and create a beautiful connection between Holder and Sky that the reader will remember long after they are finished with the book. And the plot twists! Totally did not see some of them coming, and I could not put this book down! So, I applaud you, Colleen Hoover, on not falling into the \\"insta-love\\" trap that many have seem to succumb to lately, and on creating a wonderfully tragic story about two real characters that have to deal with more than petty jealousies and childish conflicts.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I thought it was a cute story, I am 66 years old & had never read it. I would recomend to others & not wait so long.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Was to hard to change directions quickly. Also the screen size was to small. Overall it is  still a very fun game.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Perhaps this game is better for children.  I found it frustrrating, but perhaps it's just my age. I'm glad this was a free game because I would have been unhappy spening money on this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun it is alotof games thy are combined into one u beat games to unlock more interesting platter this game as adavanced deity Yggdrasil
B001QVFDA4|4.0|Well done, in the tradition of snatch. However, the story line wasn't as easy as Snatch to follow. I still enjoyed the film.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I thought it was an amazing book. I'm glad he wrote a back story to the start of the flare and about the events leading up to Thomas's being taken by wicked. His writing was as good and detailed as usual. I highly suggest this to any<br />fan of the maze runner trilogy.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Cassandra Clare is an absolutely phenomenal author. I love reading her books. It's so creative and suspenseful I just can't pull away.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|James dashner wrapped up the story nicely. With the group of communes going through the flat-trans to a safe place where they can start the human race anew. I also liked how he ended with Thomas and Brenda sitting on a hill,watching the survivors starting to rebuild humanity. It was a nice change from his usually depressing endings. Although in the case of the maze runner trilogy, gloomy and slightly depressing fits it quite well. An over all amazing read. A definite must.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book is the best ...I've read it more than once and it makes me live Nikki more every time
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have a tendency to read about two books a week and every book is my favorite until I read the next one, however; this book is by far the best book I have ever read. This will forever be in my top five, if not my number one. This book affected me in so many ways. I dreamt I was Hazel and my boyfriend was Augustus one night. I cried so much in the process of reading. I was absolutely, totally, completely enveloped by this book. It has been a privilege to experience this story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan since I started reading. While my friends were reading A Wrinkle In Time, I was tearing through my mom and dads Stephen King collection like there was no tomorrow, and 11/22/63 gripped me. I couldn't put it down! Thanks once again Mr. KING for taking me away to a new place and time! A must read!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a good read!  It doesn't take long to get into. Would read more books by author. Thanks and gig 'em
1594487154|4.0|Dan Pink's ability to explain topics backed up with research data has created books that you love to refer to your friends and colleagues.  They are easy to read and thought provoking.  This book does it again with the topic of selling, which we all are doing most of the time.  My only quibble with this book is the lack of research and examples that demonstrate its applicability to the education field.  Since I have a background in business, it makes sense to me, but I fear that other educators will find it easy to categorize the business examples as irrelevant.  I also received an advance copy for posting this review.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Good book. Has all the things you look for in a adventure book. Reminds me of pirates of the. Caribbean
0307730697|5.0|Iread this book twice in 2 weeks. I actually gave it for gifts at Christmas. For anyone who thinks they can't reach their full potential. Read this book ! For anyone who doesn't know where God fits into your life. Read this book! This will touch your heart in ways you never dreamed.
030758836X|5.0|A rich, dark blend of noir and gothic elements filtered through the 24-hour-news cycle and Gillian Flynn's grim point of view.<br /><br />Two incredibly compelling narrators, reliable and otherwise, take us behind the familiar news coverage of a beautiful wife's disappearance in post-recession middle America, where secrets and revelations come at a brisk pace.<br /><br />Clever, smart and as chilling in its way as Sharp Objects. Cool stuff!
B007L6VR12|4.0|Anderson's delightful story features great character performances by Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Ed Norton. The lead characters are actually a pair of 12 year-olds who have respectively run away from the Khaki Scouts (think New England boy scouts) and her parents (wonderfully portrayed by Murray & McDormand).<br /><br />The story takes place on a 12 mile long island (whose location is never quite identified, but is clearly in New England) that provides a nostalgic arcadian setting. There are cliffs, rivers, grass paths, forests, lagoons, Indian trails and no paved roads.<br /><br />The dialogue isn't as snappy as \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" (but then, few movies are), but it's entertaining and at times, funny.
0307592731|5.0|I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I couldn't put it down. The writing is beautiful and the journey is amazing. I loved that the story is true and highly recommend this as a book for others to read.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The BEST I have ever seen.  Can't wait to receive the 2nd season, waiting with baited breath for the mailman to deliver it.
030746363X|1.0|Since when does it take 4 hours a week to do anything right? The author is a scammer. Just take a look at his last book. Not only does it take only 4 hours a week to get ripped, remarkably, it also takes only 4 hours a week to get rich. Are Americans really that stupid? As the most helpful review says, the book is filled with a bunch of hocus pocus voodoo B.S. People, wake the f. up.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I heard one of their songs on the radio and I bought the CD and love the entire album. They have great lyrics and not all the music sounds the same which seems to be the new standard in music. I bought this album for a few friends who also were happy with their music. Listen to the samples and decide for yourself. Its nice to support a band who has talent and not just buy one song of Itunes-
1451695195|5.0|I enjoy motivational material Especially if it is inspirational. The book was a good read easy to finish.<br />You will also enjoy this book.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I bought this set for my dad who had mentioned he had been trying to get it on ebay and it was the perfect Xmas gift. He really likes the show. We love the show and the books. The first season sticks to the book and there are many characters and stories going on at the same time but they are come back together. Smart writing, complex characters lots of twists and turns. This is a great Collectors set. I would purchase for a fan or to introduce the story to someone. Young or old will love the story. Its great to watch again before the new season comes out in March.<br />Its rare to have such intelligent writing and the show not to be cancelled
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|Fun to watch.  Good action and a decent plot.  Not exactly Oscar worthy, but a fun way to spend 90 minutes!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down! The underlying romance between Ana and Grey is heart wrenching and sad! great!
B009NOVCU6|5.0|The recipient of this gift said \\"it was the bees knees\\"!!!!!!!!  And would love for all our friends to have the same joy of owning a copy of musical history!  The fricken Stones man....rolling and rockin still!!!!!
B00A2BTCTC|4.0|I ordered this on 12/21 - but only today received it. I had seen previous posts about compatibility issues with Sony Blu Ray players (after I had ordered it). I can confirm that this is the case - I had to unplug the unit just to get the disc out. I had been thinking about upgrading my equipment (but not necessarily today). I purchased a Samsung player & it worked great (actually I took the disc with me & made them play it for me at the store before I would buy it). Otherwise 5 Stars All The Way ~<br /><br />Now that I can watch/listen to it... I'm glad that I went ahead & upgraded. The audio is awesome, especially if your equipment can take advantage of the DTS-HD Master Audio<br />- 96kHz. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect to hear instruments flying around the room, but the ambiance is very nice. Being able to see the graphics & lyrics is pretty cool too. I also own the MFSL Gold copy so I do have something to compare it to. Highly Recommended & Worth The Long Wait (& added expense) Happy New Year & Congratulations to Rush for their induction into the Rock 'n Roll Hall Of Fame!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Simple gameplay and very involving. Being a Pegi myself I would highly recommend this app for everyone young and old. It has absolutely no issues on my Kindle Fire so far. When friends come over we play this and laugh every so often but we have fun with it. The graphics rock and the 3D ponies make sounds if from the mane six or if Mrs. (Cup)cake. Although a suggestion to the game makers is to make Derpy a buyable pony. Sure she's there every now and then and you get coins (bits) for finding her but if the reason she ain't there is the &quot;offense&quot;. Just make her name something like Ditzy or Hooves. But please add her to the character list. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />  ~The Ouran Otaku
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Happy with another title by Grisham...filled with twist and turn as the fiction roars along.  .Malcolm...max moved his story right along.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|its an beat em up. no dungeon exploring so far. still its awesome and fun . awsome graphics for the kindle.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|I'm really bad about connecting an artist with a song. My wife asked me to get this and I like the whole album.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I love these things for keeping my 3D LED Maglite mounted in my work truck. Has a very firm grip on the light preventing any sliding/rattling when going down the road while keeping my light within reach whenever needed. The included screws have held their grip for months now in the plastic panel I have these mounted on through many deployments/insertions of the light. If you want to mount your D cell light somewhere, this is the way to do it. Plain and simple. It works.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Hwy 37 is not a great road but this album is really good. If you like Train you'll like this album.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I play many of these games and by far this was on the top of my list. Very hard to put down.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|fun for adults and kids. my 4,7 and 10 yr old loved it. cant wait for more levels. enjoyed it very much.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|i loved the movie and couldn 't wait to order it for my cooking grandaughter. i loved that i also heard about the cookbook dvd that came with it. they didn't have to do that.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This first season of American Horror story was the one that started it all.  For those who like suspense/horror, it is a very entertaining show, filled full of edge of your seat surprises.  I highly recommend this show!
B00846REIS|4.0|Good book.  Well written and fast paced.  Very similar to 50 shades.  Hoping for a sequel and still wanting to know what truly happened to Gideon!
B006LSZECO|3.0|So glad I don't know anyone like this personally.  Made for interesting reading because the character of Amy was so out there,
B008WCP2PG|4.0|the plot is just....  bad.  the female love interest is poorly acted, flatly written, and a waste of screen time.  and yet, i give this movie 4 stars for the sheer amount of eye candy involved.  watch it on mute, you'll enjoy it more.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Its a lot of fun and can get addicting. It is way better than angry birds. A lot more challenging then angry birds. It is a little complicated and would be too hard for toddlers to around 6 year olds.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found this book to be funny, page-turning, shocking/surprising, steamy, and just thoroughly enjoyable. I would have paid for this book and the money would have been worth it.  This was a thoroughly satisfying read and I look forward to reading more books by this author.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book could not put it down once. Of course it's better then the big screen version. It's a must read
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We missed one episode and was thrilled to find out I could download it for $1.99. Thank you Amazon for providing this service.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|THIS IS A LOT MORE CHALLENGING THAN REGULAR ANGRY BIRDS AND ANGRY BIRDS RIO, I HAVE COME ADDICTED AND IT KEEPS MY GRANSONS ENTERTAINED WHEN WE HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE AT THE MOVIES, DOCTOR OFC OR ANYWHERE WHERE YOU PRAY THEY DON'T GO NUTS!  LOVE IT!
0698116496|5.0|This book is fun to look at, and has just enough on each page to keep a toddlers attention.  We look for the mouse with the banana and the floating balloons on every page.  My preschool neice loves to make up a new story line ever time she looks at it.  My only complaint is that it is paperback, which is hard with young rough ones.  If it is available, get the board book.  I have both.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|LOVE THE RIO GAME, AND NO PIGS! YOU GET A CHANCE TO KNOCK OUT THE MONKEYS AND OTHER BAD CHARACTERS FROM THE MOVIE.. MY 6 YR OLD GRANDSON LOVES THE MOVIE AND LOVES THE GAME.. SO DO I!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My youngest showed me how to play. I downloaded it and was immediately hooked! I told my best friend about it, now she's hooked too!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|My husband has taken up photography as a hobby and has acquired quite a few accessories. I got this for him for xmas and it's been perfect for storing everything he needs.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Like the skitch integration--writing on images! Will use it more and adjust review accordingly.<br /><br />i like the ability to goback and tag notes and also the variety ofstyles
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|We watched it in the theater so I knew I was going to buy it. It came in on time and worked great! Such a good movie!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is great and easy to use. I can now download from my kindle account onto my nexus 7 tablet.
B00003CXA2|5.0|We absolutely love this movie!  We have watched it so many times since we received it (on time I might add), Especially our daughter.
B007P06DO0|5.0|Hours of enjoyment!  Loved seeing the making of familiar songs and the personal thoughts of Paul Simon. Lots of footage I had never seen before.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game! Graphics and sounds are good. Ads after each game are easy to cancel. Great free game!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|just loved the whole thing i get a charge out of these tongue in cheek films , was goo till last pard ,then began to drag ,would reccommend it for every one
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Love the casting, the actors, and storyline.  It's not for everyone but we fall in the right category to have enjoyed this movie very much.  Recommend for middle age, empty nesters or singles.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Just wonderful in every way!  What's not to enjoy about the clear crisp voices and the fab choreography in this film that portrays the 60's with such authenticity!
1451629192|5.0|I ordered this book from Amazon when it was first published as a hardcover.  It took me awhile to actually decide that I wanted to and was ready to read it.  Once I started reading I could not put the book down and finished it in two days.  Jaycee did an excellent job of telling her story and she is truly an inspiration to all.  I hope Jaycee gets to do everything she has ever wanted to in life and wish the very best to her and her family.  I would definitely recommend this book!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I just finished it today. Can't wait to watch the movie. The book has to come before a movie. It is going to be interesting to see how Hollywood converted this book. I heard it's great.
0380018179|3.0|My M-I-L wanted this book because she had worn her copy out.  She loved it and it was here before the scheduled date
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Not my most favorite book. I belong to a book club and the lady that picked the book thought it was great. It's O.K. at best.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a fun game to play. I play it in my free time. I would suggest this game to people with a lot of free time.
B000W9399S|5.0|Love all Terry Pratchett's books.  His sense of humor and wry world view are fabulous.  His story lines are always original looks at recognizable tales.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Completely addicted. Great sounds, great movement. A lot of fun.<br />Easy to download. Easy to manipulate the cards and an enjoyable experience.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I don't have cable but watched the Emmy's last year.  As a &#34;freshman&#34; series, Homeland swept up the Emmy's!  Well deserved!  I  got intrigued by friends who do have Showtime and told me more about the series; I had to have it.  This was watched over the weekend; 12 episodes!  Loved the plot and the cliff-hanger for next season.  Even though I don't have cable & don't plan on getting it I will be purchasing season two when it come out this next fall!~  Great acting, great writing!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a bad read.  Kinda fast paced but I liked it.  Will probably finish the last two books in the trilogy.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game because it lets me try to avoid things and I love those kind of games so its super fun for me and my friends and I always try to race on how long we can stay alive without dying.
B000002KOO|5.0|...and have nothing but high praise for what is sometimes a playful romp in song meanings, and the lyrical style combined with Green's bandmates can break the heart.  Music theory and adaptation is not easily done in a flash in the studio.  Someone recommended this to me and I have recommended it to others.
B001GMQALY|4.0|I was prompted to watch this based on the scenes which feature eye contact between both characters.It was suggested to me that such a display of direct eye contact was conducive to sparking attraction with a woman.And I truly believe that to be true, given the great sexual chemistry that ensues those instances of eye contact. I actually enjoyed the film as well.For its time and context, this was quite erotic. I also liked the gradual development of the dysfunctional element in their relationship, the musical score often cuing us into the feeling of it being taboo and forbidden.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I have a Canon Rebel T3i with both an EFS 55-250 lens and an EFS 18-55 lens. The camera fits perfectly in the case with either lens attached. There is no room for the second lens, but I wanted the case for lighter travel. (I have a heavier case that fits both lenses and a flash attachment plus all my filters, the charger, etc., but it's heavy.)<br /><br />The case is very well made: secure stitching and the outside cover is ripstop nylon. The case has three pockets. The front pocket has two smaller pockets, perfect for extra SD cards. It also has a back pocket that will take an extra battery if you're worried about running out of power. The side pockets are perfect for filters. I can also put my cell phone in one.<br /><br />The case has a hard bottom, so it's perfect for setting down on the ground. It's light even with my camera and the larger lense in it. I love the freedom to hike without toting a twenty pound case.<br /><br />I love this case and the price is very good.
B007MDB6L0|2.0|A visually beautiful movie, but story line less entertaining. Not much 3D depth effect. Overall very fair, not very worth it.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Rayman Jungle Run is a sorta spin-off of the 2011 console platformer Rayman Origins, as it uses some of the assets from that game, and makes a respectable port of that game for various tablets and smartphones herein.  But while most games go for that path of &#34;least resistance&#34; in that they'll just slap virtual d-pad controls on that and call it a day, Rayman JR goes a little higher in its aspirations than all that.<br /><br />For starts, this could be the most fun and deep endless runner ever made.  So far.  Most of the platform elements of Rayman Origins make their way to this mobile adaptation - but hear me out!  These platform elements make the transition well; smooth simple controls are easy to handle.  Plus great animation and mostly smooth framerates.  But enough technical garble; let's get into the important stuff!<br /><br />The artwork, music, and sound work for Rayman JR is sublime.  This is addicting stuff, here.  Charming, funny art is one of this game's strengths.  Music is extremely catchy and quality...there might not be that many tracks here for variety's sake, but the few tracks that ARE here really gets the juices flowing, in a sort.  Sound and voice clips are charming as heck too.<br /><br />Now the (very few) negatives that must be stated: there are some issues with the touch screen response.  Some older tablets might experience some glitchy touch responses.  This can be worked around with the use of multi-touch, however, so no huge deal there.  Also, some stages lag on older processors, but they remain playable...just know that some stages can experience slow down...it's not a deal-breaker however.<br /><br />Overall, this is like a 4.5/5 game for me, just round that up to 5 stars; no matter. This is the best endless runner for mobile gaming so far.  Start off this year with a bonafide classic.
B000069HZP|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.....since Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors it made it extra special in my opinion
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I loved the series and bought it as a gift for my Grand Daughter who shares the same interest .

0767812166|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.....Jeff Bridges does a great job and is one of my favorite actors
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I loved the series on TV, so I am very glad to be able to watch again whenever I want.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This is a very heart warming story and is in my opinion one of the best ever sports related movies
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My wife has wanted to see this movie since it was in the theater, so I finally agreed to watch it.  I was very surprised how much I enjoyed the humor, singing, and plot.  Worth watching.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Papillon is one of my favorite all time movies and Steve McQueen one of my favorite actors of all times
B002HFP0QU|4.0|Bee Gees stands up to their name. They have a distinct sound that no other singer compares. I highly recommend you to listen to their music and bring back the good old times.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a cute story and easy read. Definitely recommend.  You almost instantly fall in love with the characters and their love for each other.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun, colorful, and addictive!<br />Sound is clear, sharp, colorful graphics, and very smooth play.<br />This is the type of game that is fun but not too serious. Just plain fun.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Really liked the whole album, great sound. I bought this album for basically for one track, but the whole album is very good.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love the suspense and jokes! Kill dem monsters!<br />Rick Riordan is a very good author in the Percy Jackson series.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Loved this book, had a hard time putting it down.  Haven't had time to read in a few years, and Horsham is my favorite author.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Like the way Nicholas Sparks writes, in the process of reading all of his books.<br />Recommend his books to anyone.
1608871045|3.0|I bought it knowing it was used in order to save money, and when it arrived it appeared as used as was describbed on the web page. (It was a gift to a Batman Fan and was well received.)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love John Grisham's writing, have several of his books and trying to read all of them.<br />Would highly recommend anything he writes!
1451695195|5.0|Dr Eben's NDE is probably the most compelling evidence so far that these experiences are real and not just phenomena due to lack of oxygen and such. His medical education and experience further support up his claim explained in his book in such vivid detail.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. It is different than the first book, but represents a natural progression for the characters and the story.
B005HSL626|5.0|My children and I love this game! It is very entertaining for my four year old all the way up to my husband. We have a challenge going to see who is the fruit ninja!! So far my fifteen year old is winning!
0307476154|5.0|I found this series to be a very stimulating read. Each book was good enough to stand on its own. I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is dozens in one! Each person in my family have different favorites. I like that I don't have to purchase anything to continue to play. I can get farther just by earning points. Is a lot of fun!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. It is different than the first book, but represents a natural progression for the characters and the story.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|THE ACTION WAS GREAT!  AND JEREMY RENNER IS JUST OUTSTANDING, I HOPE TO SEE HIM IN MORE MOVIES IN THE FUTURE.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy. This book kept me up nights, as I couldn't put it down. A very exciting read.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Absolutely satisfied with All my purchases and returns with Amazon and their affiliates...DvD was advertised as like new and arrived in retail packaging...cant find this set anywhere else so it was truly a great deal for a birthday gift
030726999X|5.0|I found this series to be a very stimulating read. Each book was good enough to stand on its own. I recommend it.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|The plot was very weak and the author took a long time to tell it filling time recounting much of what was in Pride & Prejudice.  I love all of Jane Austen's books and have read a few other authors that have attempted to write a follow on to Pride & Prejudice.  This book was difficult to stay with all the repetition and unnecessary dialog.  I have never written a book review prior to this but felt compelled as this was very poorly written and I would not recommend this.
0307454541|5.0|I found this series to be a very stimulating read. Each book was good enough to stand on its own. I recommend it.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Let me tell you that George Michael is awesome and talented!  When I saw that MTV video<br />of &#34;father figure&#34;  in 1988, I was very excited!  George Michael is such a cool guy, and that<br />girl fashion model that he picked up in his cab was an absolute babe!  I still play that video<br />all the time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I love, love, love the main characters.  I cannot praise this book enough.  I couldn't put it down.  It's so smart and funny while still being incredibly sad.  Hours later I am still tearing up.  Just buy it!
B009VB97EY|4.0|The storyline is somewhat lacking and the acting is mediocre from most of the stars, but the dancing and the physiques (why I watched it in the first place) are exquisite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down. I laughed and I cried. There is action and love and everything in between. A great book.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I watched the original Dark Shadows when I was younger. This is nothing like that! If you're looking to reminisce, this isn't for you. It was wonderfully dark humor. Johnny Depp again, in my opinion, gave another stellar performance.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|What's more to say than it worked perfectly and continues to do so.  The connectors have micro screw/bolts for a secure fit.  You won't have to re-plug it in ever time you move the box.  Well constructed, good performance, good price.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Bought it for my mother for christmas because it is one of her favorite movies. She totally recommends. Romance and more
B004GUSG4M|2.0|Eh, you kinda know what's going on early on. Gets repetitive...  I feel like I want some of that time back.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|and great dvd EXCEPT so far with 1 out of every 3 dvds it SKIPS!! only for a second, but still I paid a lot of money for this! love the series though...
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very addictive!  I don't play games very often on my phone but this will be one I go back to often.
B002ZG994U|5.0|For those of us who remember the TV show, this movie was a hoot!  The storyline was typical of the action of the old series, and really played homage to all the 'cartoon-ish' plots we so enjoyed.  Let's face it, folks, I watched the series back then, and enjoy the movie now for pure escapism... if I wanted a deep intellectual exercise, I would turn off the TV and read a book.  I like being entertained, and this movie delivers!
B00846TTDG|3.0|I dlont care for the naration or maybe the voice I dont like.It shows the life of the men who keeps us safe and what they will do for our country.Action is great.I can still hear the firepower of the boats
B005HI4LLY|5.0|It's either a horror movie masquerading as a comedy, or a comedy masquerading as a horror movie.<br /><br />Other reviews will fill you in better on the way certain horror movie cliches are basically \\"stood on their head\\" (and that would include the most frightening horror movie of all time, Boorman's \\"Deliverance\\") but we might as well be specific because this movie looks like an allegory of contemporary America. You see, one of the biggest cliches in American popular culture is the cliche about rural society, either homespun dumb, closed-minded (read racist) or in the case of horror films just plain inbred and psychopathically violent. These images did not start with horror films, horror films just sort of take these images to extremes. \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\" were a cute version of this prejudice against rural folk, \\"Honey Boo Boo\\" is the latest \\"reality TV\\" version. Some people have blamed \\"liberal media\\" but it is probably just a rural society created by city people who got sick of living close to nature in the countryside. Or they are embarrassed by their own relatives.<br /><br />\\"Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil\\" takes the urban constructed Hillbilly and puts him on his head to create a very clever but caring film that is funny as hell and filled with lots of blood. But almost every death is the result of the ignorance of the \\"college kids\\" (I mean who would dive at a wood chipper?) I have not laughed so hard at any movie for a long time.  Long live Tucker and Dale.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|The plot was typical but I keep watching it over & overt.Predictable is an understatement and a lot of bad acting but I keep watching it
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I love you Harry Bosche. Just a great series. I don't want this to ever end. Michael Connelly knows how to weave a good detective novel!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Highly recommended! $6 on kindle, you can't go wrong<br />More aimed at beginners to intermediates, but experienced people could also pick up a tip or two.<br />Easy to read, simple in its structure, but that's the point.<br />The steps laid out make sense and explained very well.<br />Just get it<br />Also, as some others have said, I emailed Mike about a couple of things and he has been more than helpful with his replies. Very much appreciated!
B000SGSU58|5.0|I love you Harry Bosche. Just a great series. I don't want this to ever end. Michael Connelly knows how to weave a good detective novel!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is very cute and although a little predictable, it's a good parody of a lot of the teenage singing movies and shows that have come out recently.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I love you Harry Bosche. Just a great series. I don't want this to ever end. Michael Connelly knows how to weave a good detective novel!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an amazing app! It has many different stages. The first levels were very easy, since I am ten but the twelve by tweleve ones were challenging and fun I will leave the easier ones for my little cousins to play with.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of The Grisham books and I believe this might be one of his best. Not as much legal involvement, but just enough to remind you who wrote it.
0525478817|5.0|This is an amazing book which was taken care for as it should have been. Was packaged very well, and was in perfect condition when it arrived.
B0081L391C|5.0|I peed my pants I laughed so hard. Great movie and totally underrated. I never saw the show but loved the movie
B0041G67ZG|5.0|This was never a big box office hit, but I really enjoyed it. The cast is amazing and the story line is riveting and timely. I recommend it
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have loved the entire Pendergast series, and this is yet another great addition.  New insights into this fascinating character, action that grabs you from the first page, and some crazy twists to keep us on our toes.  LOVED IT!
B009B8YZKS|4.0|Ok, I usually don't like character driven movies, and most Fan driven movies are sub-par to say the least. But this one was Fantastic! The characters were great, the story was (a bit typical, but) great, and of course all the Halo architecture and weaponry were AMAZING!!<br />I wasn't too impressed with Master Chief though. I thought he was a bit robotic and cheesy.<br />Regardless, this movie way exceeded my expectations, and I think anyone, including people who don't know the Halo world, can really enjoy it!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Awesome movie, but i still like the First One Better. Holmes is examined more in-depth here, however the plot is not as exciting as the first movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it. It's a really good game and it has got me completely hooked. My only complaint is the friend thing. I made a facebook specifically for this, but I really don't like how you can only get friends through facebook. It'd be nice if there were other ways to get gems. But these are only really minor complaints.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A well designed, functional, basic Solitare game.  Ads appear between games only, and are easily dispatched.  No worries with this app.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults. It is one that I can watch as many times as my kids ask to see it. Fun and a great price.
0684824906|5.0|Such an interesting approach ~ going back into all the life histories of the men involved up until they were appointed to Lincoln's cabinet.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Funny movie! The Ultraviolet Digital Copy was nice so we can watch it without having to mess with the DVD player.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|It is a great idea for a story but the plots seem to be losing some of their creativity the longer it goes on
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!  Fun, interesting, informative, a great sharing space.  Makes you think and appreciate the world and all that is out there!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|So great watching all the six movies in HD. It was a great christmas gift! Totally recommended for any fan of Star Wars
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|The movie has a pretty straightforward plot, but utilizes better elaboration upon previously overlooked details. It has a lot of action and a sufficient amount of zombie action to maintain some engagement. The actual playback was great--no skips or delays. If you're a fan of the series, it's pretty much a no-brainer to watch.
B009JBZH54|1.0|60 minutes after I started, and Flixster will not link to Ultraviolet, so I cannot watch the promised digital copies of the movies. I don't know if this is a temporary problem or something ongoing, but either way it is unforgivable force a DRM system on your paying customers and then waste their time when it does not work. I may be in for a fight as I try to get a complete refund for a defective product even though the seal is broken on the physical copies.  The quality of the content is irrelevant if you cannot get through a flawed DRM delivery system.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|This book was a great disapointment!<br /><br />I really liked the first book in this trilogy and was eagerly looking forward to book two. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />The stories were not original and the characters were not believable. But worst of all; it felt like you read \\"The fall of Giants\\" once more, just thirty years later...<br /><br />To summarize this book in three words: unorignal, shallow and predictable!
1454901276|5.0|Constant Reader. This book was absolutely wonderful.  It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a book so much. In the style of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, the author takes you to an unfamiliar geography and an unfamiliar culture to experience a very familiar range of human emotions.  At first you think it's going to be a fairly straight-forward detective novel: the solving of a horrific crime; but then you are taken deep in to the world of the detective sent to solve it.  There is something in this book for everyone: excellent writing craft; coming of age; the danger of the man-made world; the danger of the natural world; and the experience of a new landscape.  My highest recommendation.  Start it now.  Vort.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Well written, but rather a depressing tale of life in a middle class town in England. She does a good job of tying the various people who live and interact with one another together, but there is no happy ending here.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Zepto Labs came through once again!  Another great puzzler that is completely unique &amp; captivating!  Please release more levels SOON please!';)
1609419693|5.0|I didn't read the written version, but I doubt it'd be as entertaining as listening to Tina Fey herself narrarate. Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates Fey's dry wit. Also great for long car trips or commutes to and from work. It always put me in a good mood on my way to work and on my way home.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great HOG/Adventure game.  If your not into hidden object games you can play a &quot;match two&quot;type card game instead and not just skip the hog s .  The graphics are great and it runs fine on both my wife's Kindle  Fire HD and my Galaxy Tab 2.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Maybe it works better on the new Kindle Fires but while i see my news feed it keeps reloading a few mins later. I'm better off keeping fb on my S3 phone
B00846TTDG|5.0|As a member of the US Armed Forces, I sometimes am disgusted at Hollywood's attempt at \\"war movies\\" and find many of their actors disingenuous.  Not because of a desire for more \\"blood and guts\\" -- there is certainly enough of that in war and Hollywood.  But because sometimes the story  just needs to be told.  THIS movie, however, was not only incredible for it's cinematography, but knowing they were real special operators made it that much more exciting and enjoyable.<br /><br />Never forget what your fellow Americans sacrifice for you every day.  Joe Civilian truly has no idea, other than what he sees coming out of Hollywood.  This movie did SEALs and the Armed Forces justice.<br /><br />Cherish your freedom, and thank a member of the Armed Forces for their sacrifice.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This album has a variety of Beatles songs that represent many of their moods. I own everything they ever cut. But I couldn't believe it when my young niece said she wanted this particular one for Christmas.  She is in love all over again. That is why I called this a classic.<br /><br />Now I would recommend this album for teenage and up!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Excellent story, entertaining movie.  You'll enjoy it.  A \\"based on a true\\" story where the good guys win and the bad guys lose.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have now read them all.  Can't get enough, need a new story really soon!  Will also skip the movie, Tom Cruise, seriously?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I got this book because I kept seeing it popped up top of the list, and read the book description. I read it over New Year's Eve, and finished in the early morn of the New Year.<br /><br />This book is utter exquisite perfection. It's like a beautiful textbook written as a novel, a romance, and made 1000x more attractive and appealing to read because of it.<br /><br />There are already a lot of review about the story and the characters so I won't go into it. I'm more interested in sharing about what this book means. This book is an absolute must read for everybody. It gives you an understanding into sexual abuse to children and the effect it leaves on the person. And to a greater extent, it conveys very clearly and beautifully the effects of what happened in our childhood to our lives when as a child we couldn't understand what was happening, and made so much worse when there's a promise involved, or a threat. Children are trusting, and honorable, and in the words of John Bradshaw in his [[ASIN:0553353896 Homecoming: Reclaiming and Championing Your Inner Child]], children are loved to programmed to love unconditionally. they trust they adults, and they want to love the adults (parents) regardless of what happens.<br /><br />I'm very happy there are more and more books like this, as we need to be aware of what's happening to the children out there, and what's happening in this book is actually happening much more often than people are willing to realize or admit. And whether you're a victim/survivor of a sexual abuse, emotional abuse, or any type of abuse or not yet aware that you were abused as a child, or may know others who'd gone through the experience, do read this book. If you allow it, this book will open your eyes and heart so wide, and you'd feel the pain of all the people who'd been abused and you will be moved to help heal. The importance of a book like this cannot be undermined.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen, for writing so clearly and comprehensively on this topic.

B009EA3JDM|5.0|It's one of the most entertaining books I've read for a while. Everything about it was great, from the way it was written and the snakiness of Carson Phillips. I am definitely going to read it again, and I would definitely recommend it to people!
B009K0OL06|5.0|Pilot was free on Prime and pretty soon I ordered every episode, dammit!:) Good acting, new plots continue to emerge
B009E3EWPI|5.0|If you loved \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" you will love this CD/DVD.  It is a later-in-life collaboration of four highly talented musicians.  Led Zeppelin in arguably the best rock n roll band ever.
0316069434|3.0|The cold case was very good but all this time spent on his family life do not do anything for me.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|...falls short onthe description. This game is addictive and fun. Everything from the physics to the fun factor are well done. Have not playeed a game this good in a long time. A must buy ror an age.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Although the book was slow on the uptake It left me wanting more! I can not wait for the next book to become available.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD from Amazon for my Kindle Fire. It is a very creative game and one that takes some thought to figure out how to accomplish the challenges. I normally like only games that I can play in a few minutes, but I have spent quite a bit of time on this one today and enjoyed it. That might not be good when the holidays are over and I have to go back to work! I was also surprised that I could get it without having to delete other games from my Kindle, as I have so much content on it that it's pretty full.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Another great year of how i met your mother.  Each season is better the the prior.  I would recommend this for your video library!
B0085RZGYU|5.0|The Camel Club is alive and well!  Baldacci never ceases to create new adventures for Oliver and the gang.  This book is no expection and is full of action and intrigue.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|not a lot of pop ups functional. I use it when ever, always helps for a quick answer.  good tip helper
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|It is my favourite  series out of all the doctor who's because Donna is a awesome actress.<br />Go doctor who
B0070YDOT8|3.0|It's ok, but not very user friendly. It seems to take a long time to open and if you walk away for more than about a minute, it kicks you out.
B003KGBIS4|5.0|beautifully written story about a dysfunctional family that tugs at your heart strings.<br />gorgeous scenery.<br />well done. my favorite Wes Anderson film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game a lot,  not just because it is free but because it is like a brain teaser to me.You might not like it but if you do, rate it and get free points!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Broke after one week with limited use. Junk<br /><br />Very poor quality. I wouldn't buy and/or recommend this to anyone. Terrible.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A classic game that everyone loves is now on a Kindle Fire! It has certain settings that is perfect for everyone! And the best part is . . . It is FREE!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was entertaining and fun fast read I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and romance.  Can't wait for the second book. I will be downloading it as soon as I finish this review.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was okay, not what I expected though. I mean I tree was good, but not for the finally of the series.
B000V63CI0|5.0|I love this album. Bat Out of Hell I was good as well, but I have always favored this one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Just when you think you know where the story is going you are surprised and intrigued to see where the story is going I love the book
B007SGM084|4.0|Recommended for a quick read.  The story was a little dark but worthy finishing. Would recommend this book to friends
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great Movie! That's all I need to say. Would have been better with the Joker but we all know that story but Bain isw pretty badass.Anne Hathaway does a fantastic job as catwoman. My wife said it best, &#34;Perfect Ending&#34;.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! Can't wait to read the next book! Don't know why it took me all these years to finally read this author.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|MIB3 surprised me a lot! It was not only good, but almost as good as the original. A great rebound from the 2nd movie which in my opinion wasn't that good. A great story with an emotional ending. Enjoy.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|The series improved with each successive book. A real page turner that was impossible to put down. What a pity there isn't another book to follow.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It's okay it's not really my kind of game but I like the animation and for any person that is into this kind of stuff would like it a lot.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I HAVE READ MAY OF LEE CHILDS JACK REACHER SERIES AND THIS BOOK DOES NOT DISAPPOINT IN ANY WAY.<br />WELL WRITTEN AS USUAL...I JUST LOVE THIS HERO.....NO NONSENSE.......AND RELIABLE
0385535147|5.0|I think John Grisham is one of the best story tellers we have and always look forward to his next  book
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was fun and easy to read. It kept some suspense going throughout the book. It kept my attention.
B008KS4DR0|4.0|Great fun movie. Nothing serious here, just some good laughs as the story is presented from both perspectives. Kick back enjoy.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|The gameplay is fun, and you can actually earn coins instead of spending 20 bucks on points or whatever. The &quot;big but&quot;  about it is that it starts getting really choppy after a while of playing. It also took really long for me to download it (but I'm not sure it's like that for everyone, I'm using my kindle fire...)
B0015AARJI|5.0|playstation 4 dualshock 3 wireless controller works great with the new playstation 3 i bought my grandson for Christmas thank you
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Though this film is MUCH darker than the first two, it is such a gripping and intense story, that I didn't want to get up to miss any of it.  Definitely waiting for the next attempt on this Franchise.  My First Favorite Cartoon Crimefighter is still alive!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|My husband is a classic movie lover and wanted to have El Cid for his collection.  I could not find it anywhere in town and went to Amazon and found it easily.  I ordered it.  It came promptly, brand new in its packaging, and I was able to give it to him for a Christmas gift.  Very pleased.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I watched the Serial on TV when I was young.  Now, with Depp playing the role played by the GREAT Jonathan Frid, I was THRILLED to be immensely gratified that they all did such a fine job on the movie!  It is now part of my Depp collection.
B008KE3960|5.0|Incredibly fun. Incredibly challenging as you get into to the later levels. VERY addicting. Hopefully they will keep adding maps. Amazon did a 5 star job creating their first game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|apple has a free version. same stuff but u don't pay. still I'm hooked.  its an addicting game. :) lots of fun awaits those who buy!!!
B0095T3H2U|2.0|I am so disappointed, I certainly expected more with the credentials attached to this movie.  To start with, even though I like Emily Blunt, I found her natural British accent disconcerting within the confines of this particular movie.  It just did not fit.  This movie is very predictable and juvenile.  The best thing about it was the soundtrack.  The movie went from bad to worse, what a stinker!  Avoid it!!
B000002L1L|1.0|Released in 1992, this is Deep Purple's 14th studio album.  It is 50 minutes long.  The sound quality is not very good. It is in par with many CDs released in the early 1990s.  But, this has worse sound quality than some of the group's earlier CD releases.<br /><br />There is only one good song on the album (Ramshackle Man), which is not a typical Deep Purple song.  There are a couple of so-so songs and the remaining 7 are just bad.<br /><br />The performances on the songs are not very good or emotional.  Gillan's voice is really in bad form, like he has permanently damaged it (which is not the case since he sounds better on later albums).  Blackmore's guitar playing is the most uninspired I have ever heard from him.  When I got this, I had to check the credits because I didn't think Blackmore was even on it.<br /><br />I've been a Deep Purple fan since In Rock came out (their 4th studio album).  I think the first three albums by group (with the original Mach I line up) are the best.  You can get these in a nice remastered boxset with all kinds of great bonus tracks.  However, it is probably not for those who think Battle Rages On is a great album.  Then, I really like the jam albums Live and Rare (it is also known as Scandanavian Nights and not to be confused with the other Live and Rare) and In Concert, with the 20 to 35 minutes jams.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Everything you would expect from a calculator app. This app has everything you can find on a basic calculator.
B009CPIR9K|5.0|Good movie hands down. Corky and funny with a side of racism, loved it! Good special effects also. If you like Sci-Fi this is for you.
B003Y7PM3Q|5.0|I only have this on CD not the album if I still had my turtable then I proably would !!!
0061120081|5.0|I gave a copy to each of my children, at Christmas. I believe it is the greatest novel of the 20th century
B0072IUZUS|5.0|The dragon came and was a bright red and in the photo it looked more orange. I liked the red better but other people may not. Overall I love the dragon!
B004SUDPWI|1.0|I bought this movie on BluRay thinking it was a remastered version, but alas, it looks like they just took the DVD and wrote it onto a different format with no visual improvement. What a disappointment! The quality is NOT BluRay. I bought Patton on BluRay and Wow! I was blown away by the difference from my older DVD format. I will send this back and wait until they do it right, and will look more closely at the fine print before assuming BluRay means better video quality. How absurd.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is another good Clancy book, with all the usual characters.  It reunites Jack with his son, as well as, Ding and Clark and, again, they are up to the task of saving the world.  A must read!
0547848412|4.0|Life of Pi is a captivating story. I began reading this book on and off when I was in high school and they happened to have it in our school's library. I never finished it while I was there and it took me more than five years to come back to it. It was even better than I remembered it. I was also impressed by how closely the movie adaptation followed the book.<br /><br />Parts of the story dragged, but that is realistic given the story line.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those interested in philosophy and/or religion, as well as to young adult readers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Challenging because the way you decide to do your cards is depending on if you want a winning deal or a random. You can play with other people too.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun little game that's well done and beautiful to watch. I love this cartoon and game. Nice way to unwind from all the cruelness in the world today.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app! Works great and fills the time whenever I need it to. Effects are good, graphics are good, nice classic game!
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|The plot is disjointed.  There is gratuitous violence with zero physical consequences.  I mean, a guy gets his throat slit and then walks to the hospital, while his gf gets brutally raped only to show up in the next scene with perfectly coifed hair in an immaculately dry-cleaned blouse, and all of this is in 1930s rural Virginia.  And the DA is supposed to be a NAZI I guess.  Watch something else with your time.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|\\"Highlights\\" is a bit of an understatement here, with this compilation missing some key and pivotal songs and music from the musical-turned-feature. Really hoping they come out with a complete soundtrack soon. In the meantime, this is all we have. (Sigh)
B001BR5NN0|5.0|My all time fav 80's movie! Still relevant for today's teenagers!<br />A must see for all high school students of any age
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It's an adult movie that's for sure.  It's got some funny stuff in it too.  Good movie, that I would watch again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Easy to start but increasingly addictive. You'll find yourself playing for hours.<br />H<br />Word<br />Word<br />Word<br /><br />Word
0061992860|5.0|This is perfect for camping & the outdoors as it takes up very little space, but packs a lot of info. Keep it in your glove box, backpack, go bag or any other place for reference.  I'd recommend reading the book thoroughly first or at least familiarizing yourself with the topics so you can simply use it as a reference book later.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This was a gift for my 8 year old grand daughter, loved Katniss in the movie. This was the perfect likeness and one of her favorite gifts this year.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoy the game, although I'm bot very good at It! The mini games just add to the fun(:
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Arrived just in time for christmas and packaged very well.  This turned out to be a great gift for the holidays.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Still scary... Great addition for collectors of this series and the blu-ray tech is just amazing. The special effects are flawless and the performances are top-notch!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a fun little game to pass the time with! Yes it is slightly addicting but if your like me and don't have any money to spend on it in the first place than you have nothing to worry about :o)
B004I11VZ0|5.0|Donnie Yen has been overlooked many times as a martial arts &#34;Star&#34; and that really needs to stop. He is an amazing artist and 95% percent of his movies are awesome. He just gets better with time. The movie itself is entertaining and offers some insight to a martial arts legend and the sequel is just as good as the first installment! Not to be missed by action fans!!
B002TVQ4AS|4.0|It was a rather good gift for someone that really loves the Club, so mission accomplished. The music CD has nothing to do with the film though.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Action and addictive watching, you'll want to view more than once! CGI's not bad and the action reminds us of Ong-Bak 3... Highly enjoyable for action fans!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl has a clever plot that surprises you half way through.  I hated the ending, but I would recommend the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've always wanted minecraft on my computer but it cost 20 bucks then I found this and its graphics are pretty good so and now I'm addicted. Ps. LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.
0375507256|4.0|We read this for our book group.  Most people read it straight through and picked up each of the stories as they came to them.  I read each story as an entity, because I couldn't leave the first section dangling in the middle of a sentence and went to the second half printed later in the book. Cheating, perhaps.  I plan to read it straight through next time--it is worth taking the time to make all the connections and catch the allusions.
B0089XH38M|5.0|It seems to scan correctly. I feel comfortable about keeping my kindle fire safe. I don't like that I have to put so many words to rate things.  That's why I hardly rate things.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I have to say, this movie was not what I expected. I really don't want to go into details, because you should really see it with no preconceived ideas. Great action, a very well thought out plot, and an ending that wraps it all up perfectly...<br /><br />I really recommend this to people, it is a great movie.
076790592X|5.0|As a former school teacher and parent of two sons, this book teaches all the life lessons and what matters most.  This book is all about wisdom and integrity,  and I feel strongly that it is a must read for all children of all ages.  I recently purchase two copies for my sons to read, ages 32 and 30.  What really is most important in life is for families to connect through love and \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" helps define this connection.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This was like an old 80's flick where the hero needs too much motivation and extra training to do his duty.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|She always knows how to re-invent herself. Every cd shes made is good. I love rhianna. She is an amazing artist.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I was looking for the narrated version - the original movie as I remember it - and there is one disk of the four that IS the original. Very good deal for the money.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Since this is Young Adult literature I think it ended well.  For adults (cynical, hard boiled types) it was too optimistic.  However this was a great series and certainly gives young women a real, conflicted character to emulate.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I am using this on my android operating system tablet, and android is Google, and so is Youtube, but Google doesn't want you to download ANY videos from Youtube and Tubemate DOES! Don't think you will get this app from Google Play, you can't get it there either, go to Amazon. After you download the videos with TubeMate then you can play them back with (again) an Amazon app: HD Player.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|I liked the hunger games trilogy. I thought it might have gone a different way for the ending. However an apt ending which tidied up all the loose strings. I was hoping the end may have been a bit more about the after effects of the great battle. Instead it took up the whole story. I would have liked to see how well 13 moved on and who Catniss became after the fall of the Capitol. Still kept up the interest.
075669812X|5.0|Our son is a big Ninjago fan.  He loves looking at character encyclopedias for Star Wars, etc.  He loved this one, and it came with Lloyd, the Green Ninja (for about the price of the green ninja alone)!  Great deal, and he was thrilled to finally have all of the ninjas to play with.
B0088O11NU|4.0|I used to love playing with the balance games you got out of the 25¢ machines when I was a kid and now with this app, I have a bunch of them at once. Move your phone or tablet as you would the original boards and get the ball or balls to the goal.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Have not watched the movies yet.  They were a Christmas present for my daughter.  But, we have seen the movie before and love it.  We love amazon.com
0439023513|5.0|Great series! My husband and I bought read through this series and enjoyed all three of the books! Great read
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|spoilers spoilers spoilers<br /><br />my impressions on this movie<br /><br />  ~ ~ ~<br /><br />Why do they have to puke at the beginning of the movie?<br /><br />Why do they not want to be friends?<br /><br />The old man with the plastic head was a clone?<br /><br />Why behave scientists like pre-teenagers?<br /><br />In ten minutes? Was she pregnant too?<br /><br />The most intelligent life-form was the worm?<br /><br />Why can't they build a machine that does not hold the fish above your head when you do a fish-abortion?<br /><br />Why do these helmets look like big fish-bubbles?<br /><br />To Charlize: it was not nice to burn your teenage crew member.<br /><br /> ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />Ok - the geologist loves rocks and all the others don't.<br /><br />Ok - the storm will have to wait because they need more time.<br /><br />Ok - they can revive the head but it stinks and explodes and I guess they have never seen that before.<br /><br />Ok - they mixed up the DNA probe.<br /><br />Ok - you only get a blurry picture if you look back in time?<br /><br />Ok - they cannot send a robot to explore the planet, no they want to get killed themselves, what more is to improve there?<br /><br />Ok - they came to this planet to play zoo-director and to tame a worm, which - by the way - wormed the rest out of them.<br /><br />Ok - He ate too many fish on this fishy planet until they came out of his eyes and everywhere.<br /><br />Oh - he will get used to live with fish in his eye.<br /><br />Well finally, she is pregnant with a fish. Ups - it is an octopus.<br /><br />Trouble till the end of time ...<br /><br />The old man with the plastic head said something wise? No, nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Good: we leave - because, we don't know.<br />Bad: we stay - because, we don't know.<br /><br />So the creator will save them. But no, they were wrong.<br /><br />Will she wait for the plastic man too?<br /><br />Well, this creator was sleeping all the time, what do you expect?<br/><br />Bum Bang - all CGI goes down the drain.<br /><br />Ups. Charlize? Rolled over by a space-ship?!?<br /><br />Now the creator will have to face the final fish I guess.<br /><br /> ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />Do not blame me - please blame the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It's a fast paced read with lots of unexpected twists. I bought the kindle edition on my honeymoon which was great because I could read it immediately and take it wherever I went. I'd definitely recommend this book
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I'm not really into documentaries or reality tv. I like my entertainment fantasy and sci fi to the extreme but when my husband (who I myself had met online) told me about a movie/tv show all about internet dating I was intrigued. I have to admit I started with the tv show first and then was so enraptured with Nev and Max we decided to rent the movie. We were not disappointed. This movie was amazing and I'm glad it's getting the attention that it deserves on shows like Dr. Phil.<br />I won't give a synopsis of this movie because I know that other people already have, but my opinion is that it's a diamond in a sea of cubic zirconias, or if you will the catfish in a vat of cod...
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series and was thrilled to get both Seasons at a reasonable price.  Looking forward to watching them, now the holidays are over.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read this book in one afternoon and it immediately had me hooked until the end. Would love to read more about this magical place in another book.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is a great movie and to get it in a Special Edition was a bonus.  I love this classic movie and am glad to retire my VHS for this DVD.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Story line starts out sappy, gets worse, uses lots of &#34;f*****g&#34;  language which was supposed to be funny??? This really fell flat as a &#34;new idea&#34; movie.  Ted has more of a life than the humans.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|We have an old colorized VHS version of this movie and I wanted to upgrade to a DVD.  It's the only movie we have watched in which I have seen my husband cry.
B0098TL4YU|5.0|This is a great album. I am always impressed with music from Jimi Jamison. This is a great album to add to my collection.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've enjoyed all of Grisham's books, and this is no exception. His latest characters are less robust, but still loveable.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|A book to keep you on your toes. Lots of action. The interpersonal relationships that I enjoy in a Ken Follett book were missing but the action made up for it in this case.
0345803485|5.0|i just started reading it.had no idea it was a trilogy.very happy about that.it kind of reminds me of jakie collins style of writing. but then again i am only on page 38.looking forward to getting into it more,hope its as steamy as everyone says.thanks
B005LAIIA8|3.0|This title has not been released yet ,so I really can't review the subject matter  I will add more after it has been released

B009HSPODE|5.0|Alice Munro's customary quiet brilliance evident here in every story, and indeed every line. She has a true genius that many flashier pretenders can only wish they had. When is her Nobel for literature coming? Ever?

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very clever. The design and gameplay are fantastic. It's a puzzle game, which I love. It's challenging, but not to the point of irritation.
0312430000|5.0|This book should be read by every surgeon in the USA, and a checklist implemented by every surgical department.<br /><br />Steven S. Spencer, MD
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good classic solitaire. I enjoy playing for hours. Definitely passes the time and is a good fix for all the solidarity junkies.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|The kindle HD camera is very helpful. Being able to create home videos and pictures is a beautiful thing. The camera takes very clear pictures and videos. I love it.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Really helps when reading for a long time to hold up the Kindle Fire for a better view of the subject matter
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is way better than the movie! You really should read the book before watching the movie it would make the movie way better!
B008ODZEQ0|1.0|Like any intelligent, forward thinking citizens of the 21st century, my wife and I are feminists.  And like any feminists we were shocked and disgusted by this movie.<br /><br />Both the main character (Jiro) AND the narrator are male!  If alarms aren't going off in your head so far you're probably a bigot.  Things became more and more repulsive as the movie played on.  All of the supporting characters are male!  And even worse, almost every single character in the movie is male!<br /><br />I don't care if this is a documentary.  My wife left the room in tears at the end of the first hour during a particularly sickening scene where Jiro serves a room full of customers.  He says (not an exact quote) \\"I made the meals smaller for the women and larger for the men so that everyone would finish at the same time.\\"  Things like this would be expected in a film about Adolf Hitler or Winston Churchill (both disgusting sexist pigs)but in a movie about food it was just chilling.  And that wasn't even the worst part!  The women in the room appeared (probably special effects or movie magic of some type) TO APPROVE OF THIS.  Can you believe that?<br /><br />My wife won't talk about it and I'm not sure I could if I wanted to.  I finished the movie with tears in my bloodshot eyes.  I can't believe we've advanced so far as a society and women are still seen as being gutter scum.<br /><br />Anyone forward thinking enough to simply be on the internet, to find this movie, to read this review, will be disgusted by the brutally sexist assault on your senses and common decency this movie has gotten away with.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! It was amazing! It kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Read the books!!!!
B000QUUD60|5.0|This is one of my favorite concert DVDs of Elvis Presley. I could absolutely watch it time and time again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book cause of the details the author has and it is related in some ways to real life
0385535147|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Grisham books to date. I could read it time and time again. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. It is a really good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't even say how much I liked Downton Abbey - it's even better than the old Masterpiece Theatre series Upstairs, Downstairs. If you like English drama, you will love this.
B00003CXRM|5.0|A quick delivery,perfect condition,one of the greatest entertainment ever created. We will enjoy it for a lifetime! This is priceless George Clooney!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Totally disjointed storyline but pretty good special effects. Never knew where they were going with the storyline.<br />I'm glad I didn't spend the money at the movies to see this film.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a sweet little story to wind down before I went to bed. I would strongly suggest it for a quick ' read.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|My 3-year-old got this for Christmas, and spends long stretches of time playing it. Normally she doesn't have that kind of attention span! It's got durable stickers that are easy for her to use. But I wonder why the designers made the clothing only fit certain people in it. It would be so much better to have interchangeable clothing so the people in it could all share and make more scenes. As it is, many things are cut for only certain people. An older girl would surely get annoyed at the limitations. But even so, it's still a great toy for many ages, and fun to play alone or with a sibling.
0375507256|5.0|i can see where this wouldn't be for everyone, but I loved it!  it jumps around and there are some great characters in it!  different and a fun read!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I installed this app after my tablet browser started having problems with facebook. This app works much better than the browser has been. I have not had the newsfeed problem that some people have described. They may have a hardware issue (e.g., lack of memory).
B0067R0APK|2.0|1) why does this not show/remember the current or 15 day forecast when not online.<br />2) very cluttered interface<br />3) the app icon looks exactly like the one on the appstore (with the 'sale' as part of the icon.
075669812X|3.0|Shopped early for Christmas, but never thought to check that the Lego figure had all the necessary parts.  My 5 year old grandson loves Lloyd and was very disappointed when the character compartment contained 2 sets of legs and no body.  Return window was before Thanksgiving so we're stuck with these useless parts.  Will think twice before ordering from Amazon early.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Grandson loved it!  It was a gift. Both grandson and grand daughter were able to enjoy the CD.  I even got into the music.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|A billiant read. I can see why this book is so highly recommended. I couldnt put it down. From beginnng to end the story is engaging. Its disturbing yet captivating look into the future of online gaming. I can see the appeal in basically living in your imagination. Smartly done!
140053271X|5.0|Fast delivery, great price. Own several and all my kids love the nook. It took a year before they actually used the first nook but once they did they never stopped using them.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This \\"unrated\\" confused both parent and kid, as we both think it is safe to all party. But not after 3 minutes we watched this movie with our 11 year old boy, we have to stop watching, because the movie is full of dirty words, I don't want them to pollute my kid's and my ear.  So $2.99 wasted like that. won't buy any unrated stuff anymore .
B0084AXZK0|5.0|As I am used to reading silly books and graphic novels, this was quite a read indeed. There seems to be an omission of detail, leaving one to imagine what terrors the protagonist commits that leads to the life he takes in.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|There is a good book in here...you need to skip the other parts to find it....hoping that the next book restores the franchise.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love it a lot. I get AWESOME dragons. Buy buy buy. Why do people hate it because it totally rocks!
0670026603|5.0|BRILLIANT! With its unforgettable characters, breathtaking storyline, and unconventional romance, ME BEFORE YOU will leave you standing with your mouth gaping. Expect to laugh, expect to cry, and expect to scream out \\"Jojo Moyes, how could you? Nooooo!\\" Most of all, expect a thought-provoking read that might challenge your perspective and definition of the quality of life. I absolutely loved ME BEFORE YOU. Don't miss it!<br /><br />This is the perfect crossover novel for older (YA) young adults--eighteen and older.<br /><br />Some additional thoughts:<br /><br />ME BEFORE YOU is a novel about changing perceptions and pushing the limits to maximize personal potential. It's about inner growth and identity, what shapes and defines us. Many will be able to identify with the inner transformation of twenty-six-year-old Lou Clark from waitress to assistant of the once take-charge-of-the-world wonder boy, Will Traynor.<br /><br />Another extraordinary highlight of this novel is the dynamics of Lou Clark's and Will Traynor's families. There were times I hated how Lou's family treated her, reinforcing her faults instead of helping her and having faith in her to make good choices. But there were also plenty of moments where they rallied, pleasantly surprising me with their generosity and love. With Will's family, I was in awe of Jojo Moyes' portrayal of the internal struggles Will's mother faced and how her hard-shell exterior would occasionally crack to allow the reader to empathize with her.<br /><br />This novel is not only character driven, but plot driven -- a perfect combination of the two. Even the secondary characters will make you think about your personal dynamics with others. For example, Lou's boyfriend Patrick will make you think about love and relationships. Lou's sister Treena will evoke thoughts about your siblings and the importance and influence they have had in your life.<br /><br />Best of all, I was deeply moved by the relationship between Lou and Will. Irefuse to spoil it for you. Read ME BEFORE YOU. Enjoy the journey and allow yourself to be swept away by this unforgettable novel.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you need a laugh and you like Seth MacFarlane's brand of comedy, this movie will deliver. I don't know why I'm always surprised at what Mark Wahlberg can do on screen, but he once again shows he's a pretty good comedic actor.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I am able to use my excell documents but the drop downs don't work and I can't lock the caps .  it's usable but not what I expected
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it! I got that Jumping-up-and-down-squealing-with-joy reactions. Just what I was going for.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I prefer THE WEATHER CHANNEL over other apps partly because this is the website on my desktop I have relied on for years to give me accurate tropical storm (hurricane)weather.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|DVD is great. The audio and picture is not Blu-Ray, Hi-Def quality but considering the time, it's totally acceptable. The most astonishing thing for me is experiencing Michael Jackson at precisely the prime period of his craft and skill. This concert is before the Pepsi commercial accident, which burnt his head, requiring surgeries and began his journey into painkilling additions. It's also before the child molestation allegations, before the severe physical changes he underwent to his skin and facial construction. It's just a excellent snap shot in his life. His voice is strong and beautiful and there is a sweetness about him. I would strongly recommend this concert for anyone wanting to experience him at his finest time in his career.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|kids love this, my kids play the piano and this is one way they play for fun when we are on the go
B001DEVZUG|5.0|all the music are her hits so the whole CD is great + I love listening to Annie Lennox she got a great voice
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This is my favorite book in the series and the last dvd I needed to complete my collection (I previously got this at Target and it stopped in the middle of the movie for no apparent reason). Amazon to the rescue!
B000B2YQX4|2.0|This music bits I don't know what I did with it, I don't think anybody is stupid like me. .
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  I recommend it for an engrossing read - no wonder it has been on the best seller list.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|this is only the hits he produce so its worth the money. . . . . .. . . .
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|If you have read and loved Brandon Sanderson you will love this story!  He weaves unique twists on magic use (once again!) into a story about people and motivations while exploring the human condition.  With Brandon you don't just get a great fantasy novel, you get a thought-provoking work that will stay with you long after you have read the last page.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|Its good to hear them again, its sounds great and up to date, worth the money . . . .
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was such a delightful read. Highly recommended! I was surprised to have enjoyed this so much. You will enjoy.
B000BFH2S2|3.0|I still cant play it on my DVD player due to the fact that it is from london. Need info on how I can play it here in the US.
B0027DI05A|5.0|This is a beautifully written story.  I found myself a member of the family,but I cannot imagine the terrible poverty and living conditions they thought were normal. I read this in high school  but enjoyed it so much more this time
B00A7CI82I|5.0|great movie...great series!!---very enjoyable---lots of action!! the Bourne books are full of action and keep you on the edge of your chair
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Gawd, they only get shot at like a million times... and not one of those bullets actually manage to hit them?  This movie has a great story concept, killer special effects and decent actors yet it delivers poorly due to the cavalier hollywood approach of 'lets just throw a ton of money at the production and people will like it'.<br /><br />Too bad cause I was looking forward to seeing the story without having to watch Ahhnuld mash up the lines.
3833160454|3.0|Thank you.  Difficulty is getting equipments and tools.  More information would be appreciated.  Some of them do not exist anymore, so where does one go?
B0002HWQEE|2.0|Disappointed. The toy is good quality.. but it is SO small..I didn't expect for the money this cost, to be able to fit this toy in the palm of my hand.
