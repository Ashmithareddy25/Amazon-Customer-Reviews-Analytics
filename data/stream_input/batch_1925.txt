B0009QTS1M|5.0|This movie was beautifully mastered and a great adittion to my collection. This is my favorite movie by far and would recommend the extended version for sure.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|one the best anime films of all time. so happy its now on blu-ray. very time is see this movie have to watch & watch again.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|The storyline is unusually disjunct for a DreamWorks movie, but the brilliance and detail of the animation don't fail to keep your attention.  Wanted more of the minions, a good deal less of Vector, and a less contrived ending--dance finale was a totally incongruous and gimmicky Madagascar-esque device.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|This is a flick for when you just don't care.  The story is so cliche and it fails to bring the funny when it tries.  It's forced and a little gross.  If not for the singing I would not have finished watching it
B000001GQH|5.0|Great sounding CD.  I gave this as a gift but will probably get another one for myself...and more as future gifts.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has been absolutely flawless. The perfect calculator app for your Kindle Fire HD! Finally an Amazon app that doesnt suck!
B005PZ85SO|4.0|Happy Ending:  I missed this last year and had heard several people talking about this episode.  I enjoyed it and I felt it closed several loose ends.  And who doesn't like a beautiful wedding ?
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I really enjoyed her other two books better, but I had fun reading this one nonetheless. It's good for an easy, fast, fun read.
B0083F5JE6|5.0|I would recommend this album to everyone! It's a combination of pop, dance, jazz, and something else that just all fits together perfectly. I don't get tired of it and I love ALL of the songs! I picked a few favorites, and each time I listened to it I added another, then another, then another, then another until I was simply satisfied with: I love all of the songs! Can't recommend it enough, and won't get tired of it. Everything is different, meaningful, and still has a great beat. I'd definitely get it (I did!)
B0053O89WY|5.0|we watch BBT all the time and re-runs too.<br />I ordered this as a christmas gift for my friend-which I will be seeing very soon.<br /><br />order was as prsented on site.<br />Fast delivery<br />packaged well and no damage, sealed package.<br /><br />will order again.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages.  It's funny for the kids and deep and meaningful for adults (still funny even if you're a grownup.)
B008HT4FUW|5.0|It's a great way to catch up before the season starts.  I watch it while I am on the treadmill.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Comparative Religious commentary for first fifteen chapters.<br />Settles into boy vs tiger struggle.<br />Continues to impart guru/swami/Sufi take on life<br />Interestingly kindle version has previous buyers' highlighting of passages underlined.<br />This is akin to a library book that has pencilled comments or underscoring - not to everyone's liking.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Evenn though it deals with religious subjects, the ben affleck, matt damon  flick is a riot.  poiints out how people are more concerned with the thought of religion that just<br />getting It'  Extremely talented cast and a favorite to watch over and over
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Just as expected from Taylor Swift...only the best!  Love all the songs and so do my granddaughters...we are wearing it out!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I love the impression that you get of India in this film - the sounds and colors, the rush of people, and you can almost smell it.  The ensemble cast is a bunch of venerable pro's - I will watch Judi Dench or Maggie Smith in just about anything and I certainly wasn't disappointed with their performances here.  I believe the film got mixed reviews but not from me.  It's a life-affirming story about the capacity to change and evolve, even when you are elderly and beautiful.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Different but if you are a fan you must have. Thank you Jeff I am very pleased.<br />It was a great purchase.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Story is good and twisted.  I wish the end of the book would have been different, maybe tied everything in together.
030758836X|2.0|Fairly good story line until the end.  The ending ruined the whole book.  I wish I could get my money back.
0061928356|5.0|The book was fantastic.  I couldn't put it down.  It was sensitive, moving and a wonderful read.  I contacted the author to praise her work.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Okay I'll be honest, I have watched this movie three times now and I don't really know what the plot is about - and I really don't care. These stripping scenes are amazing. Channing Tatum's &#34;My Pony&#34; dance is really all you need to get you through life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was thrilling, awesome and exciting to read.  I'm ready to read the final book, the suspense and action has me wanting more.
B000YQSYBM|5.0|Have loved this album for years.  Top notch. In order to sing along I typically gargle razor blades and smoke ground up tires to emulate Waits' style.  Not for the faint of heart but effective.  Buy this album and listen repeatedly.  You will not be disappointed!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Works as advertised.  Very accurate current condition & future forecast information. I like to set locations for a quick look of current weather conditions in places I'm interested.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I really liked this movie. Of all the comic to movie renditions this is one of the better ones. The extras included in this disc are the normal ones you'd expect to get. Overall if you enjoyed the movie I'd suggest the purchase of this disc.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Favorite movie of all time got it for the family time everyone loved it came just on time quality n description a pluss
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a really good show. It's a bit dark for young children but slightly older kids will enjoy this as will adults.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Neil Young is my hero...his voice is timeless...his guitar playing is the absolute best.  Love this man for all of his good qualities besides his singing/songwriting!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I loved this series so much I had to include it in my collection of movies. I would highly recommend it.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I found this very useful in dealing with my friend who had a stroke 10 years ago.  Thank you very much
B003L77G6A|5.0|I LOVE the Big Bang Theory! Every season is just as great as the last and it just keeps getting better.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Riveting!  Went out to get more of th Jack Reacher series.  Just what I have been looking for.  Already reading another.
B008HK3TXK|2.0|After two weeks of use the stitching around Velcro clasp tore and started pulling away from the cover.  I exchanged the item for a new one (Amazon is always great about returns), and after one day of use the Velcro clasp tore on the new case as well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Use it on my Kindle Fire.  Love it.  It's easy to use, wakes me as required (I use the Old alarm setting), and gives me the weather outside.  I recommend.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I bought it because my husband owns all their cd's.  Would recommended this gift to anyone.  Good for all ages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down, by far the best BOOK I've read in a long time, I cried , laughed and fell love with the characters. I cannot say enough about it, A MUST READ.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Reminds me of the old Atari system.  That kinda tells my age. Haven't played much but it is fun.  Works well on kindle fire.
B0086700CM|4.0|well I loved this game untill about a week ago what happened is you have to tilt your kindle to collect coins in the game and when I go to tilt to collect the coins it won't let me! And I wondered if it was my game or my kindle and my brother had the exact same problem so that is why I'm only rating this game three stars<br />Otherwise great game
B0090YHSFC|4.0|This is a good hand eye coordination game for all ages.  Worth a try.  Works well on my Kindle fire.  A lot like fruit ninja but on ice.
B000SEI230|5.0|Made me cry. I would recommend this to all my friends.  I'm confused though, did she live or die? He made it seem like she's still alive.
0007444397|5.0|I'm a HUGE directioner, and this book let me know even more about one direction than I already do know.  There are lots of photographs in the book, so it doesn't look as long as it seems.  They even include the boy's answers to quickfire questions that they were asked in  the \\"gameshow.\\"  If you haven't seen the quickfire videos yet, go look them up.  They are HILLARIOUS.  Lots have changed between now and when they came out with the book though, so many things are missing from this book, including their current girlfriends, and their 2 new albums.  So, if you're a 1D fan, read the book!<br />Warning: Photos may cause many girls to faint because of one directions beauty.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Didn't care for the ending.  It left the reader up in the air.  I was hoping the story would be resolved.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I do not love this app. It goes too fast and the songs are good but, it is difficult to keep up with the highlighted keys. In other words this app did not suite my interest.
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|I have tried multiple times and it just doen't seem to work for the Acer Iconia A500.  It just keeps searching for the server.  I know the Plex server is set up OK, because my Roku sees it.<br /><br />I am sure it is a good App, but perhaps not compatible with the A500, without some sort of update.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars anyway..
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app can be challenging. But it takes time to master, my four year old brother can do it ( but only the first few levels :) The first few levels are simple, but get harder until it seems impossible!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Fairly predictable plot but cute if you like Amy Adams and or Clint Eastwood and or Justin timberlake.... good ending
B000TEUSJK|2.0|I just didnt understand this movie. It was just<br />downright strange and bizarre. It just did not<br />make sense. Was a waste of time!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Violent, violent, violent  ..... good plot, good acting .... worth a watch and especially good ending to the story  - not for children
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was phenomenal. Never read anything like it. . I will continue to read any books made by E.L James. Really outstanding  and extradinary
B0035J6TAI|1.0|depress: vt. 2. to lower in sprits;make gloomy;discourage;sadden... this describes this album in a nutshell,while New Blood was a musical triumph,Scatch My Back sould<br />be thrown back into the fires of Mount Doom from which it was forged!!!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie when I discovered it poking around on Amazon's site. It was a very pleasant surprise! Fun, poignant and very artful. Both my wife and I loved it.
B0061S073A|1.0|If you have time to figure out the program, it might be great, but who wants to \\"test\\" a product that doesn't give you an easy start?  Sorry but I need instructions on how to use an app like this.  The start up has a list of all the apps on the kindle.  You are instructed to add them to Kids Place. Since there are no instructions, I selected all of the apps and i figured i could delete or adjust the settings later.  Next you end up on the kindle home screen with no ability to adjust anything.  I am finding the app impossible to delete.  It has locked out all of the regular settings menu.  I am in 100% agreement with the other reviewer that would have given this 0 stars if it was possible.  I hate apps that assume that the parents are as tech savvy as the kids.  THAT IS WHY WE BUY THE SOFTWARE TO PROTECT OUR KIDS, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT AS TECH SAVVY!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|When I installed this app, it opened up my account with me providing password information.  I MUST HIGHLY CAUTION EVERYONE NOT TO INSTALL THE FACEBOOK APP!!!!!!<br /><br />btw, inspite of what it says here, I am not Michael Berry.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|This was a movie I  would recommend ! True story and good acting I want to see more on Lincoln
B009PK9SB8|2.0|Had to take the first one back because it didn't work so I took it back. Second one does not perform well and tech support is not responsive to phone calls or email!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Wonderful book one of the best great Christmas story year in year out and years to come just finished reading it to my kids
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Like all Lego kits its great. Great kit fun to put together. My son built it in 2 days. To bad the real shuttles are done.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it doesn't make you buy stuff, just say no. the game isn't impossible without buying in game money. it ks still an amazing game
0525953728|5.0|Would highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in the UBL mission, which adds clarity to the movies and documentaries already out there. Inside look from one of the men on the mission.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My Granddaughter has loved and enjoyed each IA movie since they started and this one was just as good as the rest.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Honestly, I thought this Cd was a masterpiece first listen through. It was to be expected of tool, since I've loved every album previously released. Once I went online and saw how much more negatively this particular album was received compared to previous endeavors, I was shocked. If Wings for Marie and 10,000 days were the only songs on this album, I would still give it a 5/5. Every song is well crafted and the lyrics are amazing as always. The top reviewers hit the nail on the head, so I will just add that the cd packaging is pretty fun to mess with. I spent like an hour going through all the 3d pictures while listening to the album.
B000I0QK74|5.0|If you like J.T., and you like Christmas and Christmas jazz/light sounds, you will really love this compilation of songs.
0143120530|5.0|This is an fascinating book which follows a group of people who are into memory competitions. (Who knew memory competitions even existed??)  The author does a great job describing not only the fascinating people who compete in these competions, but also how the participants prepare for them. It's a fun book, and it also has good tips on how to improve your own memory.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book. I stumbled upon it and was intrigued by the 5 star rating and low price. Wool 1 was a bit slow at the start, but gripped me by my shirt collar by the end. Wool 2-5 were (pardon the pun) woven together perfectly. The character developement was deep and felt real. I truly cared about the characters and was sad when the book was over. I am looking forward to reading \\"First Shift\\".
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a good idea for a app it is free and fun loving it so far you should get it now
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Absolutely hysterical... not for easily offended... BUT... lines are non-stop!! A couple times, we had to pause and back-up the movies since we were laughing so hard for so long we missed the next scene!!! Thumps up!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Realy makes you think while keeping you on the edge of your seat. Great story can't wait for season 2
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Not only was the movie actually good but the package came here right on time and was not scratched at all not even the cd. I recommend any movie Amazon provides.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I do not know why, but this series just seems to be so right. Maybe it is the mix of the high English traditions and the thoughts of a grand life. Any one who watches will see life has not changed so much as to the trails and tribulations which happened in the 1910 to 1920 time frame. The acting is very good and the setting is great. Also the &#34;seeing&#34; how automobiles, electric lights and even the telephone came into peoples lives in this period make one really think of how each of our lives is so different in how we live today. The next season will add to a great program.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could hardly put it down. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys suspense and love stories. That book.
1433502410|5.0|This is an excellent study Bible.  One thing that any potential owner should consider is that the theological view of this Bible is narrowly Evangelical.  Most of the other theological views of the 2000 years of Christianity are ignored or briefly noted (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologies are as old as Christianity while the Evangelical view was born with the Reformation 1500 years into the life of the Church).  This study Bible is clearly presented in that vein, so I was not at all surprised by this specific view if Scripture (nor should anyone who buys it).  I feel that is an unfortunate feature and that a more balanced annotation would have enriched it considerably.  However, with that said, this is an extremely in-depth and highly academic work that will benefit anyone who is a serious lay or academic student of the Bible.  Just be fully aware of what you are purchasing.  Although I am not Evangelical, I hold the scholarship that went into this work, in very high regard.  The benefit of having such a comprehensive literal translation with extensive annotation is highly valuable for all Christians.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am hoping everything worked just right as this was a Christmas present. Didn't open it and watch before I gave it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Sexy! Sexy! I have read both books in the Crossfire series and I will buy the third as soon as it hits the market.<br /><br />Not perfect, but definitely hot. The characters are damaged and sometimes more annoying and immature than necessary. Found myself rolling my eyes a bit.<br /><br />Worth a read. Quick and easy.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game. I love slicing fruit. It is a stress reliever and long with just a fun game. I love it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My kids loved this in the theater so I had to get the blu ray for home.  GREAT MOVIE if you have not seen it.
B002UPA4ZY|3.0|The Audio was great but the Visuals just weren't exceptional.  It's a bit disappointing.  I should have just purchased the Audio CD.
B005HSL626|5.0|my kids get a kick out of this fun game!  My husband enjoys it too...I am afraid to get hooked.
0547884591|5.0|I have read and reread all of Tim's books and 4-hour Chef is his best work yet. A fantastic resource for a fun, healthy life. I have given several copies of 4-hour Body to my friends. We have made contest our of some of the challenges. It's a great way for my buddies and me to hold each other accountable to a healthy lifestyle. I have already given a copy of the 4-hour Chef to my brother in law. We can't stop talking about it.<br />Cheers to Tim Farris for doing the research and creating this awesome 4-hour manifestos. I just finished the \\"add 100lbs to your bench press\\" from the 4-hour body. I only added 76lb (6 months) to my press, but 275lb isn't bad for a busy 45 year old, 5'5\\" 150lb dad of three, who finds it difficult to make time to work out.<br />If you want to look better, feel better and live better, take on the 4-hour lifestyle.<br />Steve from Omaha
B007MDB548|5.0|My girls have all the tinker bell movies.  This one is just as good as the rest and they love it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|fun to come back to. my only problem is some friends dont show up on my list in the game
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Great movie.  Great take on Snow White.  I would NOT show it to my kids, however, it is too scary for that.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I have played other Bloons and this one is better yet.  Lots of great characters and upgrades.  Love the many different tracks and difficulty levels.  Definitely worth it, lots of playing time.  That being said, I really hate to pay for a game and then find out you still have bonuses that you need to purchase.  I assume that as you get into the harder levels, it will be extremely difficult to finish without the &#34;friends.&#34;<br /><br />Other than that, no complaints!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love this book! Didn't think it was possible to like this more than Slammed, but wow! My words cannot convey what a wonderful story this is.....just read it!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very catchy right from the start. Kept my interest throughout the whole book. I read this one non stop the whole way through.
0316789720|5.0|If you children are avid &#34;drawers,&#34; then this is a perfect little book for them, and a perfect addition to your &#34;how-to-draw&#34; books.  This book is very different than other how-to-draw books. It gives instructions for the most basic shapes of things, using simple shapes as building blocks. The results are something greater than a stick figure, but something less than a cartoon. However, all these simple drawings are a great &#34;starter&#34; for any picture. All the drawings can be expanded or built upon into more complex drawings, like my 7yo and 13yo do, but even if used as they are, they help my 3yo and 4yo draw wonderful pictures! Especially when you combine several of the elements in this book into one drawing. I also think it is a great tool to help students learn to keep an art journal--because it is so helpful for drawing little illustrations of practically anything.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this for your children because they like to draw, I do not think you will be disappointed!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Have to love Jim Carrey. The kids love it. You never get tired of this movie. Have to have this movie going all christmas long.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great hidden object game...highly recommended!<br />I have really enjoyed most of G5 games.  This one has great graphics and mini games.  Looking forward to more from this developer!
1419701533|5.0|My 10 year old grandson is thrilled with this set of books.  I wll be purchasing more of this series plus other books.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Great bag, fits two DSL, external flash, 2 lenses.... and a bunch of other extras. The only downside is that it isn't very pretty. :/
0525952926|5.0|Second in his latest trilogy, Ken Follett has his usual high quality story that ties in nicely with the first in the series.  Very good book for Follett fans.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have not read a book in 3 days since I was a child. I'm not big on reading mostly because most books cannot keep my interest. This isn't the type of book I usually read either. This was super. I would say that everyone should read this and fall in love with the characters and feel what they felt as I did while reading. GREAT JOB John Green. I'll keep up with your YouTube blogs. DFTBA!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Made me laugh, cry and wanting more. I would recommend this book to anyone. The story line was captivating kept me going
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The case is solid and while the extras are skimpy but I just wanted all 8 movies so this is a very good deal.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|This is a classic I never read before, but the Kindle price was certainly right.  I enjoyed it, but as much for the history of English law regarding estates as for character development and plot.  I was struck by the similarities between Pride and Prejudice and PBS' series Downton Abbey--same issues regarding inheritance of a major estate when all the children are daughters, the role of a male relative, the ambiguous relationship between the male and female protagonists, etc.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I can't believe that the Stones have been around this long.  Like fine wine they're great aged!!  Get this album with all their best and you'll be dancing till your legs fall off.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Only watched 30 minutes then gave up. At that point I figured it is more of a guy movie but my husband said he didn't even finish it.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Wasn't going to buy this as I saw it on cable free on demand,  and while I liked it I didn't feel a need to own it to rewatch it at some other point in the future.  But by the time I got to season 3 I was hooked and saw things that related back to the other seasons so I broke down when they had a sale and treated myself.<br />It's well worth it.  The show uses the Colorado kid as a jumping off point.  I read a review of the book and while those characters conduct an investigation into the mystery it's not the tv show.<br />The tv characters are interesting and the actors do a good job.  It's so easy for actors to phone in performances in a show like this but here they take it as seriously as if they're doing a Broadway play or Shakespeare.  The creators, in a behind the scenes stated they try not to do a 'trouble of the week' episode all the time but even when they do the trouble always relates back to something with the town's history or illuminates an aspect of the show's characters.<br />So, whether you're a Stephen King fan or not pick up the dvd or try out the show in the Amazon digital section and get HOOKED.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I am always willing to give the free books a chance, haven't gotten to read this one yet but I can't wait. It looks cute.
0345803485|2.0|I have been hearing about this book for months now, and I read all of the bad reviews. With that in mind, I didn't feel that I really wanted to spend money on this, in case they were right. Instead, I waited for three months to get it from the library for free. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this.<br /><br />Where to begin? There is so much repetition in this book that it will make your head spin. And I personally wanted to scream every time Anastasia mentioned her inner goddess - can anyone say ANNOYING!<br /><br />I can't for the life of me think why this book would be so popular, unless it's because of the sex. And even that, in my opinion,  is very tame and not really a turn-on at all.<br /><br />I gave this two stars instead of one because I did find certain parts endearing, like the bantering back and forth in the emails and whenever you can actually tell how much Christian cares about Anastasia, not just in a sexual way.<br /><br />I have the other two books in this trilogy on my old kindle, and I might break down and read them at some point, mainly because I feel like I spent all of that time reading this book and we are just left hanging, with absolutely no resolution to the story. BUT, I think I will need a few weeks to recover before I dive in and start with those.<br /><br />I would only recommend this for the morbidly curious like me who have heard about this book and want to be \\"in the loop\\" so to speak. Very bad writing and not much plot, and the book is ridiculously long considering those facts. Read it only if you must!
B00973902K|5.0|We joke around at work about this song so when I saw the chance to have it and not have to youtube it I grabbed it! It really is a cute song!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved every minute of this book. The way the book begins draws you in and you can't put it down till  the end! I would love to read a sequel!
B009E3EY38|4.0|If you're looking for Zeppelin from 1973 you won't find it here.  But if you want to see your idols play their songs almost 40 years later, this is where it's at.  And I'm perfectly fine with that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addicting. The best part for me is that I can't  spend a long time at it. Just 5 or 10 minutes here and there. It is just enough to fill in that free time. Plus,  no problems with the game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For some strange reason I never purchased Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. Once The Dark Kninght Rises was announced I told myself, just wait for the trilogy on Blu-ray. I couldn't have made a better choice. All three films are awesome and for the price, forget it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely, positively a page burner. I loved every bit of it - the plot twisted and turned, and I could not figure out the ending! I could not put it down. Sad theme, but I love it when good conquers evil.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I first watched this movie back in the early 90s, not knowing anything about the Evil Dead movies and absolutely loved it.  It is a great blend of horror meets comedy.  Well, actually it is not high in the horror category and probably won't be giving anyone any nightmares.  But it is funny.  Yes, comedy horror can be cheesy and this movie has its fair share of that, but it isn't nearly as cheesy as the Scary Movies.  The movie quality seems to be above a B-rated horror film, but not top of the line.  It's got a good story line to it as the main character Ash is pulled back in time to like the 1300s and seeks to get back to his own time.  He can only do this by finding the book of the dead in a graveyard and saying the right words.  Well, things don't go smoothly (or aren't said smoothly, however you look at it) and an army of the undead are unleashed to conquer the fortress that Ash is staying at.  It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it.  There are many memorable lines from it.  If you like Medieval comedy horror with some sarcastic humor you may like this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a masterful story teller. This book was just as good as the first two. I was totally surprised at the ending.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am so caught up in this series...I have read for three days solid...I can't wait to start the next book
B003O86FMW|5.0|I almost didn't read this sequel because I thought the story had ended. I could not believe how Suzanne Collins took the story and made it even more intriguing. Once again, no way I could figure out the ending.
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|I am giving this Blu-ray 2 stars.<br /><br />I really loved the movie and it is worth a 5 star review.<br /><br />However, the subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing are pretty terrible.  They do NOT subtitle any of the singing at all.  The singing is more than half of the movie!  What is the point of have subtitles that are specifically labeled for deaf and hard of hearing when there aren't subtitles for half the movie?!<br /><br /> Universal Studios should be ashamed of themselves.
B007NU54H4|5.0|The movie was a Christmas gift for our little girls, and it most certainly did not disappoint!  The story was great, the music was great, and the girls also loved the bonus &#34;Pixie Hollow Games!&#34;
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I can't get enough of these three...remember when you loved Stefan in Season 1?  Well, this is all Damon, baby!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish that there was a fourth book to continue reading.....finalizing Peeta and Katniss' now normal life. I feel like the ending was just cut off.
B008EKOO46|1.0|What brave new world we live in when the Digital Download version of a book costs five dollars more than the price of printing a hardcover version of it and physically moving it around the world.<br /><br />Madness.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great and fun couldn't enjoy it more. Wish I had dragon calculater. that would help me a lot. other than that its a great game.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I got this for my wife who really enjoys the film &#34;love actually&#34; which has a very similar (possibly the same) version of &#34;All I Want for Christmas&#34; she is also a big fan of Ms. Carey's music. I earned points with this one.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Absolutely ferric read. Best book yet in the series. I always wait with great anticipation for the next one.<br />Drat. Now I have to wait another year atleast.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I haven't played it enough to know enough to rate it,but so far so good. It is easy to play and easy to navigate.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|The smile and look of sheer amazement on my nephews face makes this gift worth every penny. Hours of fun playtime.
B00138D320|5.0|This is Herbie at his best when it comes to Progressive Jazz. I listen to this music when I'm at work and it motivates me.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this app is one where you search for things and different rooms. as you find more stuff you unlock nor rooms and more quests. this is an addictive game
B008CLI4N4|5.0|So excited that I could burst can't wait till 3-31-13!!! This is the best show since I don't know!! YAYA!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been fairly disappointed in most of the books by new authors lately (well, new to me, I guess). I'd seen the various WOOL titles pop up in my \\"suggested readings\\" list by Amazon and frankly was not intrigued enough by the title or description to read any of them.<br /><br />I was really in the mood to read something to start off the new year and bit the bullet on this collection of the WOOL stories. Boy was I surprised. No spoilers, but I really didn't see the end-twist coming in the first tome. That pretty much sealed the deal for me right then and there. This kind of thing does not happen often to me and I'm thrilled when it happens.<br /><br />The other things I liked? Intelligent writing, intriguing story-lines, an author who doesn't \\"talk down\\" to his readers, and one of the best things: no real spelling or grammar errors! (OK, there are some formatting issues, but that's not an \\"author issue,\\" it's a \\"typesetter issue.\\" And those are really just some oddly-formatted line breaks here and there.)<br /><br />In short, I cannot wait to read more books from this author. If he keeps up this quality of work, we are all in for a treat!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Great season this season definitely picked back up after a slow season 2.  Can't wait for the season to resume
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game was glitchy at times and at least twice did the game itself force me to erase and start all over. Didn't save progress sometimes and set me back a few goals occasionally.
B004X4QW42|5.0|Incredible movie.  Watch the first and second Ip Man if you consider yourself a Kung Fu enthusiast.  Donnie Yen is an incredible actor.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Bubles Christmas CD was wonderful.  He has such a beautiful voice and the duets with Shania Twain (White Christmas) and Thalia (Feliz Navidad) were spectacular!  I'm so glad I bought it!
B004EPZ08O|3.0|My DVD said it came with digital copy . It did not . I wrote company asking why I did not get my digital copy and as of yet have not heard from company ....<br />Ralph B
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Easy to use and figure out. It is quick to find what you need.<br />I like the icons because they are fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I must admit when I first started playing Coin Dozer, I told myself I may have made a mistake downloading this game. After 3 or 4 games I have to tell you I'm starting to get hooked. Trying to rack up the coins and prizes is quite the challenge!! Now I find myself unable to put it down.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Enjoyable with a lot of puzzles and hidden object.  A bit hard to follow at times but hints get you back on track well.
B00004RFFW|5.0|this is another great cop buddy flickthis time involving the debut of Leo Getts(Joe Pesci) and the racists south african governmentalists trying to hide behind diplomatic immunity. But it does nt last and justice prevails.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|When I saw the trailers for the this movie, for some reason I thought it seemed like an edgier comedy (perhaps due to the casting of Rebel Wilson and Adam Devine). However, it was formulaic and just another one of those &#34;Glee&#34; like movies. Disappointed for sure.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I purchased this movie because my kids ages 1, 3,5 and 7 really loved watching Horton on a rented DVD.  They kept asking after we sent it back!  Jim Carey does a great job! I would recommend this movie!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a  very good game you should get it right now. I enjoy playing this game with the cut pet's and how they play.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie was great!  The songs were great!  I can't get some of them out of my head! &#34;Everybody needs a thneed&#34; for instance lol! Hope I spelled that right! My sons ages 1, 3, 5 and 7 ask me to play this often, I don't mind because the message is loud and clear and great!  Watch the movie and let's all take better care of our planet!!!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|After ordering the Sex and the City - Collector's Gift set as a Christmas present for my girlfriend I was disappointed when the discs failed to load on the laptop. Season 2 Disc 1 wouldn't not load at all on her laptop. A technician friend inspected the disc and noticed it was dirty and used rubbing alcohol to clean it (I would expect with the $71 price tag the discs would arrive at least clean!). After doing this the disc still failed to load, so he manually right clicked on the disc drive (E:/) and hit \\"play with windows media player.\\" This did the trick and now the CD is loading properly. I was surprised as the other CDs loaded fine and only this one so far has given her trouble. Note: do not use the DIVX player to load the episodes, only the windows media player. The only positive mark is that a supervisor refunded me the $71 so I could purchase the \\"Deluxe edition\\" for $107 on amazon. Hopefully, the deluxe edition will not have this problem. I will update this posting when it arrives.<br /><br />Update: The Sex and the City - White Deluxe Edition arrived and my girlfriend couldn't be happier. The episodes possess much better video quality and look like they are 720p. This is compared to the \\"barely\\" 360p of the Collectors Edition. She also likes the introductions on the CD and of course the fact that the episodes actually loaded without any problems!
1781164150|4.0|I wanted more details about the film<br />No dislikes, nice details and good art work<br />Can't wait for sequel 2015
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Johnny Depp does a good job as always. A little comedy on the orginial series . I laughed a lot watching this.
0307387178|5.0|I would recommend this book for high school students in an English class. It is has a tremendous depth and meaning.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Excellant buy for me as I didn't get to seen all of this season and missed her having the baby.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a rollercoaster ride during the whole book.  I now need to know what the next event of craziness is going to be!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Good drama with just the right amount of comedy. some really good actors that I would like to know in real life.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I am a flutist who would love to see more rock flute out there.  I just bought this, and kept it on in the car as I ran my errands.  It is musically complex and awe-striking; has its own musical worth other than the rock flute example.  Highly recommended for music fans of all types.
B000002AQQ|4.0|loved the movie, and like the songs on here as I grew up listening to them. A good buy for me.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very good book and it was great to see Harry Bosch back on the street and in action. I hope his character stays alive as long as I do!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I think Harry grew up too fast. Glad i bought it but can't say it was as good as the others.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This DVD Collection was perfect for me. I have all 8 movies in one space - and it is small enough to store.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Bought this as I so enjoyed the first season. I haven't watched it as yet but if anything like the first  will be just as good.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I like it. The pop ups are annoying, but the game itself is fun.  Puddings are<br />really cute, and I like to make them fall off the table on purpose because it makes me laugh.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There aren't even enough things I can say about how good this was.  Amazing isn't even descriptive enough.  I also don't want to give spoilers.  Read it and weep at the beauty.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was one of those reads that make you want to call in sick from work, just to hide out and devour it in one day.  The story line was amazing and had lots of eyebrow raising twists and turns.  This is one of my all time favorites for so many reasons.  Finishing Hopelss was bitter sweet since I will miss it so much.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is really fun to play, and when you need to stop just pause your kindle, and it will add coins while you are busy.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This movie is a must-have for Pixar movie collectors.  The colors and animation make for a VERY beautiful movie.  I love this storyline and the Blu-ray version is the icing on the cake.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|saw him on saturday night live and was blown away buy his level off talent had to hear more bought this and its a great cd not a bad song on it
B004UFEJVW|5.0|This animated movie grabs your heart from the very start.  BEAUTIFUL animation.  Great movie. Recommend adding it to your collection.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Over the years I have found that I enjoy the adventures into which various authors incert their characters; Connelly's Bosch is one of those authors, and policeman Harry Bosch is one of those characters it seems I have come to know.  Harry's environment seems to be one I can relate to; he &#34;shows&#34; that pompus boss &#34;how it's done&#34;, a pleasure I (and I presume many others) would have liked to enjoy.  Both Harry's professional and parenting skills are, as they always are, simply excellent.  He finds a way to be a terrific dad while figuring out and tucking it to really bad guys.  As usual, he manages to come out on top.  So much for the  Bad Guy, so much for those Bosses, and to his daughter, he's just dad.  Harry gets them again.  Nicely done, Mr. Connelly.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|This turned out to be a surprise. I read a biography of Charles Dickens written by his daughter and that caught my interest in reading more works by Charles Dickens. I am currently reading The Pickwick Papers, and it is a very long 'series'. I am enjoying it immensely, and the entire works are promising to give me many enjoyable hours of reading. Can't recommend it enough.<br />Charles Dickens writes in a style of capturing life on a daily basis. He studied people in various circumstances and gives a believable account of their reaction to events. Quite often he paints his verbal drama with humor, always in good manners. Dickens is one of those authors that teaches good judgment, humility, integrity, and any number of good lessons in life. Everyone will benefit from his moral obligations as a grandly respected, all time great author.
0525478817|5.0|This book was amazing, I actually bought it way back when it was originally released, very worth the money. I would buy this book 1000 times over.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|I was looking for a good deal on a watch and found this to be a great buy. They shipped it fast and I'm very happy with the watch and the seller.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I saw Alicia interviewed on the news and then heard an excerpt from the album.  Ordered it and it is not only uploaded onto my ipod, but also in the CD player on shuffle.  &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; is Track 6 so just fast forward  to it and be prepared to have a great song in your head and heart.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|All of the favorite ponies from the cartoon are here. Help bring Ponyville back to its former glory! Save it from eternal night! Cute skill games and quests mix up gameplay.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in a little over 24 hours... I just couldn't put it down!!! Intensely written and heartfelt.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie knows how to get you hooked in the story and make every girl want a Travis Maddox of their own!  I couldn't stop reading!
B008518MOW|3.0|I enjoyed MIB3, but overall it was down a step from the previous.  I can watch the original MIB over and over and still enjoy it. MIB2 I also still enjoy, has several things going for it. MIB3, meh. I bought so will watch again sometime, but it was marginally enjoyable and not overly interesting.<br />A lot of it was somewhat predictable, it wasn't as funny and the new K was kind of boring.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was an entertaining read that served its purpose of keeping me entertained during a family holiday.  Think of it as the perfect beach read during the winter. I found the characters likeable and the story to be a slight twist on the boy meets girl, falls in love and then runs away.  I would read more from the author.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I was dubious that a made-for-TV series would look much different in HD, but it did.  The video quality of this Blu-Ray set is phenomenal.  Also, after having watched the PBS-edited versions of seasons 1 & 2 previously, I was happier with the full UK version--as other reviewers have noted.  As an American, I probably don't understand the nuances of early 20th-century British inheritance law (one of the reasons given for the PBS edit).  But as a fan of the show, I'd rather see those things included even if it requires the occasional research online.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|this is a great product. it was just what i was looking for. it arrived on time, in great shape!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really don't know what to say about this book... I hated it, then I loved it, then I hated it again. Very entertaining with all the twists and the \\"no F-ing way\\" moments, but I don't think this book is my type.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love having this easy to use dictionary on my Kindle.  Not only is it a dictionary, but has other features such as &#34;learn a word a day&#34;, weather report where you set location, your horoscope, story of the day, and several teaching games for adults.  I recommend this to everyone I know.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was well written to keep my interest, however kind of sad that it takes place in a society of killing kids.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Worst movie I've ever seen in my life.  Total waste of money.  No idea what it was even about, various monologues strung together.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I already had the 3 mixtapes he made but being that he gave us som much for free, i had to buy the albums. Great buy. good to listen to, especially when you are chilling
B003E8P9G0|4.0|The book is awesome! It was so interesting. I couldn't  stop reading. At first I thought it was lengthy but it doesn't feel like it. I have to admit you might get confused with all the places. Other than that the book is exciting!<br /><br />Vanessa- 10 yrs, 5th grade.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it!! I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the movie. Makes me want to read more of his books.
B008458O3S|5.0|Seems too easy at the start but offers a nice challenge. One of few puzzle games, or any games, that kept my attention for the whole thing.
0525478817|4.0|As seen on Book[never]ends: [...]  Hazel Grace Lancaster is 16 years old and has been diagnosed with Thyroid cancer since she was 13. Determined to be depressed by her overbearing mother and doctors, she is forced to attend a support group with other teenagers who suffer from cancer. It is there that she meets Augustus Walters, a cancer survivor  who lost his leg to osteosarcoma a few years ago. Together, the two learn what it means to leave a mark on this world.    Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I love John Green books in general (keep in mind I've only read Looking For Alaska in addition to this) for the reasons I think that most people do--his witty humor and sageful life lessons that are quotable and can easily be slapped on throw pillows ('encouragement' worthy) and tumblr photography.    I feel like these qualities both help and hurt Green's books.    First--the witty humor. While it is witty and humorous, its Green's wit and humor, not his characters--or should I say his characters are him? In that way, I felt like Hazel, Augustus and Issac were all very similar and not very well developed because their humor was all the same: they all were just characterized versions of Green with very slight nuances (watch one of his vlogbrothers youtube videos and you'll know what I mean).    This I feel I was able to overlook easily simply because I do really enjoy Green's humor (which as I said before, most all of the characters exhibit)--I think he's hilarious--so I didn't mind the same hilarity from all of  the characters in the book.    Another thing I noticed that Green does it that he likes to use uncommon names for his protagonists--Augustus, Alaska (Looking for Alaska), Quentin (Paper Towns)--its quite a fascination. I don't mind it much though, in fact I like it. Personally, I think YA lit has enough Katies/Kates, Annas/Annies, etc. Also I think it helps get rid of certain stigmas certain names have (or the stigma could just take over the character, but I didn't have that problem in this book--although I couldn't read Augustus' name without singing the \\"Augustus Gloop\\" song in my head...). Maybe chick-lit-worthy-love-interest Augustus Walters will help overcome the stigma attached to the name Augustus (thanks to a certain German chocolate-philia golden ticket winner whose obesity gets him stuck inside a tube...).    The ending of the book I feel also follows the pattern of Green's previous books--the anti-climatic greater life lesson epiphany that summarizes the overall idea of the book. In Looking for Alaska it was:  \\"He was gone, and I did not have time to tell him what I had just now realized: that I forgave him, and that she forgave us, and that we and to forgive to survive in the labyrinth...So I know she forgives me, just as I forgive her. Thomas Edison's last words were: `It's very beautiful over there.' I don't know where there is, but I believe it's somewhere, and I hope it's beautiful\\" (218, 221).  In this book it was:  \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.  \\"I do, Augustus. I do\\" (313).  While one may argue that many of these repetitions between TFIOS and Green's other books are just a product of Green's writing style--and while to a certain extent I can agree, I feel like these repetitions will get old if it continues in his future books as the novelty of his writing becomes repeated a few too many times.    While the book had me laughing on every page and had very insightful life lessons that didn't cross the line of preachy, Green lost some points by structuring the book too similarly to his previous works and by failing to create distinctly different and unique characters.
030758836X|5.0|I do not generally read mysteries or thrillers but after hearing about this book I thought I would give it a try.  I was not disappointed, this book exceeded my expectations by far!  I could not put it down, and after I finished I had to take a minute and just think about it (which for me means it was pretty good).  The psychological aspects were what did it for me - that makes it so much more fascinating than your average &#34;who-dun-it&#34;.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|oh my god its just sooo much fun and not enogh good words in the dictionary for it and I just love it....
B0058VW36U|1.0|I liked this game at first and the powerups made melike iteven more. Now where are the powerups ha! And the thing that eats the candy why does he get candy. he should be dead how could he swallow the candy whole. unfair, I rest my case
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I simply loved this book.  Cinder draws you in and makes you feel her emotions, her tenderness, her pain, her embarassment, her hopes, her dreams.  The secondary characters are also well-drawn.  Five stars - can't wait for the sequel!
B000TYWAUA|5.0|I did have problems with it fading color and stoping and starting. It was better then netflix I think.<br /><br />Cindy
0786958731|4.0|no matter if you're doing the same adventure a 2nd time, it's always a little different.  Not the same as playing a full-blown RPG D&D adventure, but an easy and quick way to quell the urge.  Some of the game-play ends up setting you up to fail the mission but a few minor adjustments or &#34;house-rules&#34; make for an enjoyable and rewarding family gametime.  We will be looking at future games in this series!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game was very easy to download and install. It is very easy to figure out how to play. I like the helpful hints and the ease of the game.
1780221355|2.0|I loved both books written by Gillian Flynn but this book disappointed me. At first it kept me entertained but I just got bored with it. I finally skipped to about 3/4 of the book and that's when the book caught my attention. I'm sure that I skipped out on some details but the ending caught up with everything. The ending is surprising but overall, it is not a book that I would of kept around. Better checked out from the library than purchased.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing!!!that was the best book i have ever read in my life!! I could not stop reading the awesome book
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This book had me riveted right from the get go! the writing is superb the topics discussed universal (no pun intended) and the characters felt so alive it was painful to witness them falling in love.  A wonderful story about the real issues that affect one when death comes to visit. Highly Recommended.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book has many surprises and keeps you on your toes! Loved it! It was a beautiful love story at times and a suspenceful mystery!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Super awesome game. Kind of like qwell but a little less challenging. Definitely worth it for free tho. If you like puzzle type games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was definitely a page turner. It's filled with all of the deepest emotions and feelings that life can entail, including love, loss, regret, and happiness. The whole story line is so full of emotion and really tugs at the very core of your heart.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I hope they keep the great writing going, with the traditional Sherlock enigmas and new twists. Three outstanding leads. Looking forward to each episode.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game there are so many levels I have had it on every phone that I own. My kids enjoy playing it as well. I recommend this game for everyone to try.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|My 8 year old son is new to Tolkien and has been exposed only to the Peter Jackson complete twist up. We are helping him read the books and he's enjoying these sets. Too many teeny tiny parts to keep track of though. Yes, I know that they are Hobbit sized!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This novel is extraordinary. Anyone who thirst for adventure and love needs to read this book. Peeta makes the book come to life with his intense feelings for the girl who was on fire. Collins focuses on events and character more than scenery, buy somehow it works perfectly.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What an incredible book so different from Sparks other novels but sooo good. Loved the suspense and twist ending, a must read definitely.
B007SPN5MA|4.0|Glen Hansard on his own - no band, no Marketa Irglova, easy listening, interesting musicology, varied ensembles, reflective and relaxing
B005IQ39AY|3.0|New to Me.  Havn't had a chance to really try it yet but think I will really like it when I do.
B005544V6A|5.0|Me and my almost teenage kids love it.  Combines legal and business complications with personal drama and comedy. Watch the series from the beginning:  starting with the pilot.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a really good book and funny one too. But Don't take my word for it see for yourself
B004W2UBYW|5.0|- it presents both sides of Steve - good and evil<br />- very good history and background on how the world's most important company evolve<br />- great pictures
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book, was absolutely wonderful. I would read it again, and again. I still want to know who Charlie was writing too. And what his life turned out to be.
B0041D843M|5.0|- plenty of scientific data to back claims<br />- full and complete citations<br />- the main idea is hard to ignore<br />- now I know how to take care of my diet<br />- can be a bit lengthy
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love it. It's was a great book .I can't wait to read the other. Now I just have to read the third wheel
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book lives up to the hype.  I ordered it after seeing it was one of the top choices on a reading website.  What I liked most about Gone Girl is that it works on several levels.  You could enjoy it as a straight up thriller/mystery or also appreciate its subtle writing and ironic tone.  Some may not like the ending, but I found it entirely plausible and true to the tone of both the characters.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was really good. I liked it because of what the topic was about and it was funny.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Awesome Game. Hours of fun. Very challenging. Hope they make more levels or World of Goo Too. Sooooo worth the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yes it is expensive but it's worth it. If you only have 7 dollars, buy it!!! You will never get bored playing this app. I enjoyed it because it has many of the same settings as the pc version, and has AWESOME seeds.<br /> There is no downside other then some things are missing. All in all, I recommend this app!!!
B0096I9UTE|4.0|This latest work of hers is done more artistically and shows her soul. She has been known for being easy on the eyes, and this CD shows that she is also soothing to the ears. De-Lish!!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|My only complaint is you should be able to change tiles or they change with levels cleared. Sometimes get a headache staring at same tiles!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Slightly better than the first. It was sooo suspenseful. I couldn't stop reading it once I got started. It really got my blood pumping.
1609611543|3.0|After reading this book I think it tries to blame our nations obesity problem on one food.  It over simplifies a complex problem.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the wool omnibus.  The characters were believable and made you feel their lives.<br />I am not a science fiction fan AT ALL!  This book, however, made me doubt my dislike.<br />I wanted faith to be a bigger part of the book. Then I realized it was the book.  I can hardly wait to jump into his other works.  I wonder if the author, also, does music.  I'd like to hear what his mind could create in the realm f music.  Just think in'!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Cliched?  Check.  Corny?  Check.  Predictable?  Check.  But fun, funny, and super singalong appeal.  Tom is great, and so is the rest of the cast...I loved it!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|There was too much war detail for my taste and too much time spent on detail descriptions of places, furnishings, etc.  Just tell the story!  I will not purchase the sequels due to this.  I have read many Ken Follett books so I was expecting a great read and was disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought it was worth the read and it appeared well the read until I started to read the rebuttal. The 2 together show what our faith is all about and how easily Satan can deceive us. It explains, in the Rebuttal how Eve and then Adam were deceived. both books complement each other.
B00177BY3C|5.0|I don't know how I managed to miss Dead Can Dance for so many years.  Really amazing.  I am now collecting each of their albums, and enjoying each very much.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved it. As is usual with Grisham I could not put it down. I never expected the end. It was not what I thought.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been enjoying playing my free game of Spider. Loads of different hands  to play with plenty of challenges. Great to occupy my time when I have a moment to spare.
B000I186FW|5.0|Love the movie.  Quality of the streaming is excellent.  Compares to &#34;Brave new world' or to &#34;1984&#34; to give everyone something to think about.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like using the calculator. it is basic and helps me with all my calculations. could have some more scientific functions though.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Actually a really good book. I cried. :/ but hey it was a good cry because he was all infinite and it made me sad and happy at the same time...

B00933JF74|1.0|This is a waste just get the free app it is exactly the same. I am pissed to have been suckered in.
B00AB3YG0G|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book. I was hoping to eagerly await the reading of the third and final one of the series, but instead, I was hugely disappointed. The plot never thickened. The story slipped into fantasy when each family seemed to experience the same circumstances and follow the same life path, over and over. While well written historically, with minute details of events of consequence, the overly descriptive sexual scenes added absolutely nothing to the narrative except unnecessary length. With such a rich history to explore, the author should not have resorted to the use of such devices to maintain interest. Rather than achieve that goal, it distracted the reader from the importance of the historic thread of events. It was just too easy to predict the lifestyle and events which would befall each of the book's participants depriving the reader of any mystery, whatsoever.<br />Following on the heels of \\"Fall Of Giants\\", this second installment of The Century Trilogy, picks up where the first left off. Hitler is rising to power and life in Europe is marching lockstep toward Fascism with communism and Stalin's totalitarian government close behind. It covers war torn Europe until shortly after Russia's acquisition of the atom bomb and the beginning of the Cold War. Aside from containing the faults of the first, being a little too long and having too many characters to follow along comfortably, this was also too contrived and contained little of the positive qualities of the first which was an interesting and engaging story. Although the history was interesting and was well researched and developed, even when, at times, there was a passing of many years which seemed to slide by unnoticed, the story itself was completely unsurprising and the characters were too artificial, placed in circumstances that defied reality.<br />Perhaps, to move the story along and connect the same five families from the first book: the Williams, the Fitzherberts, the Dewars, and the two Peshkov families, the author simply used too many convenient coincidences and so was unable to maintain a sense of reality for this reader. Each of the families experienced an unwanted pregnancy, either from rape or lust or simply poor judgment, followed by the birth of an illegitimate child who was either brought up in secret or well loved. Brutality, injustice, and loss afflicted them all. At the same time, concurrently, the older generation each had an offspring that ascended into the hierarchy of the government and became influential. Each served their country either as a volunteer or in the armed forces. Although many of the political systems were at odds with each other, i.e, Socialism, Capitalism, Communism and Fascism, the particular goals of the characters, no matter which country they represented, were the same; love of their country and nationalism were at the forefront. Each believed they were helping to create a better world, although some were terribly misguided in their efforts and purpose.<br />The development of the characters could have been more detailed and diverse, so that each family's life that was explored was unique, rather than almost a carbon copy of another's. They came from different countries; all of the young men were in the service of their country, regardless of their political preference; they were capable of being compromised, they were sometimes naïve, and yes, they all seemed to feel it was okay to make a woman pregnant and ignore her plight as if they were not involved; yet each family's story could have easily been substituted for the other's, without skipping a beat, just by changing the names and locations, so similar were the paths each traveled. How could each of the families, the English, Welsh, German, American and Russian, all suffer the same exigencies of life, without the story descending into something rather arduous to read because of its redundancy?<br />The history being covered was so rich with informationthat I was struck by the inclusion of trivial subject matter and superfluous family themes. It was simply too repetitive, too trite and each outcome, each action of a character was simply too foreseeable. There was hardly anything left to the imagination. As you turned each page you almost always knew what to expect and what would happen. The characters were related in so many contrived ways: Although he didn't know it for most of his life, Welshman Lloyd Williams was half brother to Englishman Boy Fitzherbert. Lloyd became second husband to American Daisy Peshkov. Boy was her first husband. Lloyd's mother, once a housemaid, was made pregnant by Earl Fitzherbert, Boy's father. She was disowned by her family, bore the child and moved to London where she married Bernie Williams, a Jew and a Socialist. She is now a member of Parliament. Both her brother Billy and son Lloyd, enter government service as does Woody Dewar, son of a Senator, Gus Dewar who also met the Russian Peshkov's brothers, Lev and Grigori, when they were young boys in Russia. The Earl's wife, Bea, and her brother, were responsible for the execution of their parents.<br />Lloyd Williams did undercover work rescuing those trapped behind enemy lines, and also ran successfully for Parliament like his mother Ethel. Maude Fitzherbert, sister of the Earl, secretly marries German, Walter von Ulrich, with Ethel Williams, Lloyd's mom, as witness. She like Ethel was disowned. She moves to Germany where she has two children, Erik and Carla. Erik is first a Nazi and then a Communist. Maude and her daughter Carla, disillusioned by Nazism, steal secrets from a German officer to sabotage Hitler's rise and conquests. Ada, the von Ulrich's maid, and Carla's friend Frieda, both had a relative who was murdered by the Germans for being mentally deficient. Carla marries Frieda's brother Werner Franck. He was in the underground working to overthrow Hitler. Although she is very young, she adopts a Jewish child, Rebecca, whom she \\"miraculously\\" rescues from a German camp along with Hannelore, the wife of a Jewish doctor, Issac Rothmann, whom she had befriended and for whom she secretly worked and brought stolen supplies, after he was prohibited from practicing medicine any longer. Daisy Peshkov is also related to the Communist Russian Peshkov family. Her half brother, Greg, the illegitimate son of Lev and Marga, is a capitalist. He knows Lloyd, her husband. They met during the war. Lloyd and the Earl were in the same regiment in the service. Her mother, Olga, also, was pregnant before she married Lev who was her chauffeur. Her Russian cousin Vladimir, (Volodya Peshkov), illegitimate son of Lev, works undercover as a spy for Russia. Greg was involved with the group who developed the atom bomb. Volodya's wife, Zoya, is a scientist who worked on the Russian bomb. Volodya's sister is married to a brutal member of the secret police, who arrests Zoya, Volodya's wife, to force Volodya to turn a scientist who worked on The Manhattan Project into a spy, in order to steal the secret of the bomb from America.<br />Carla has an illegitimate child resulting from being raped by Russian soldiers when they conquered Germany. Boy would have had illegitimate children like his father, but he was infertile from the mumps. Ethel Williams had the illegitimate child of Earl Fitzherbert. Grigori Peshkov takes care of his brother Lev's illegitimate child, and he raises Volodya as his own, marrying his brother's pregnant girlfriend Katrina, when Lev runs away to America to escape a murder charge. Daisy was conceived before marriage and would have been illegitimate had her mother not married Lev, who had been her chauffeur. Daisy's brother has a secret illegitimate son, Georgy, with Jacky Jakes, (her stage name), a young black teen, hired by his father to destroy Dave Rouzrokh, a man he competes with, by creating a sex scandal, falsely accusing him of her rape; Woody falls in love with that man's daughter, Joanne. She is killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Woody Dewar's brother Chuck is gay and his sweetheart is Eddie. Chuck is killed during the war. Boy is killed in the fighting in Russia. Every social issue raises its head in this book with every social disgrace sharing the page with honorable behavior. With all of this confusing, highly coincidental information, is it any wonder the story became tedious?<br />On the positive side, \\"Winter of the World\\" certainly shed light on the system of espionage and the acts of betrayal by citizens of a country, often considered treason or allegiance, depending on which way the war went and who was to be the victor or the vanquished. The study of the character and courage of those who sought to defeat Hitler and even Stalin, often at great peril to themselves, was an emotional journey for the reader. Often, hero or villain was determined simply by circumstance of time and place. A man sharing secrets with Russia, to prevent America from becoming dominant, thought he was being patriotic, thought he was saving the world from further death and destruction. Yet he was betraying America and was a traitor. The man betraying his country, Germany, so Russia could defeat Hitler, became a heroic figure, although he, too, was betraying his own country and committing treason. The problem with the book was that these moments of true bravery or cowardice were surrounded by circumstances that required the reader to suspend disbelief in order to feel genuine sympathy and/or respect for the character's behavior in such a situation. The events were simply not always credible in the way they played out, and often they were too easy to anticipate in advance. The characters were naïve, and although, at times, for obvious reasons, as in Russia, where the citizens were kept ignorant, often they were simply too immature or headstrong and behaved in a ridiculous manner. Perhaps the frenzy that possessed Boy Fitzherbert and Daisy Peshkov was typical, but their presentation was simply not authentic.<br />In the next book, for sure, each of these characters or their progeny will return to end the trilogy, and each will probably suffer the same fates as their counterparts, over and over again. I was surprised that the author did not mention Israel, although he was discussing the important events of the century. It was completely omitted in the second book, although it goes to the end of 1949. Israel was created in 1948 with war immediately following, which is consistent with the themes in the book. Perhaps it will be a new thread that is picked up in the third and final piece of the trilogy.m she \\"miraculously\\" rescues from a German camp along with Hannelore, the wife of a Jewish doctor, Issac Rothmann, whom she had befriended and for whom she secretly worked and brought stolen supplies, after he was prohibited from practicing medicine any longer.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Characters are very well portrayed enabling the reader to know them; however a few are not what you'd befriend.  The suspence and surprise turns of the plot are exciting and keep you reading.  Well done.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is addicting! Can't wait to see what Season 3 holds for us! Really want to know who will be getting married!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I love the color its nice to be able to set it down and it stands on its own. I even got a grey and black on for my son and husband.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series and cannot wait to see the next season.  My all-time favorite series hands down.  Quality programming without resorting to gratuitous sex and foul language, although there IS sex and murder and intrigue.  Just love the attention to the detail in the settings of that time period.
030758836X|3.0|I read this book for a book club I belong to. It was written very well, and was surprising to the end. Unfortunately I hated every minute of it. I found the characters so unlikable that I really did not care what happened to any of them.  My final thought -Good Riddance!
B006LS7DQE|5.0|This was a very well thought out game it combines the best of RPG elements, and the best of bejeweled into one package. Not only do you get to match colors of any 3 or more in a row but you get to battle RPG style, the story is pretty good and you get to upgrade your armor and weapons from time to time. The gameplay is very addicting and the graphics are great, a nicely done game !
B004I1WIWU|5.0|I received it before the arrival date so that brought me to tears. As i remove the vinyl out of the sleeve i realized that i could use it to destroy shang tsung. So i started playing and shang walks in the room with a ball of fire in his hand and says to me \\"be prepared to die\\" imagine that in a deep old man voice. We stare at each other in evil glares and then the song turning tables comes on and he immediately starts sobbing cause he was embarassed that he had no control of his raging fire hand disorder. Overall, this album is very good. I would highly recommend it to the leaders of the other realm.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Constantly evolving plot.  Very interesting charactors. You really don't know how each person will change during the season. Can be watched each week with a different plot but the actors are changing over time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is the most entertaining game so far. I like that it has so many levels without having to pay for them. You can always go back and play the levels over and over to try and raise your score.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love how it covers the entire screen so the keys are a nice size.  Perfect when needing a quick calculator
B003XWFLTM|5.0|I like his symphonies, nevertheless, I prefer his operas.  Voice is very important to Tchaikovsky.  But these symphonies are master pieces, well done!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|We really like this movie, Just another example of good science-fiction fun. I only wish I'd been more into playing the game when it was so popular.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This work sets the standard for all Christmas stories that follow it. In my opinion it is bested only by the real story itself found within the Gospels. Dickens wasn't the greatest novelist of his time, perhaps not even the greatest of his friends and acquaintances. However, his characters will live with us forever for no one can introduce us to better ones. Old Ebenezer Scrooge is perhaps one of his best known and has become a symbol of anti-holiday merriment. Added to this is the plight of the poor which Dickens describes in painful detail drawn from his keen eye and actual experience. Plus, it is Kindle - you can't beat the price!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I'm addicted I cant stop playing. although its not the PC version it is still worth the $6.99 pricetag!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book was great,  I expected the book to be sad considering the subject, but I laughed as much, if not more than I cried.  I' m looking for a book for my book club pick, this may be the one.
1452101248|5.0|This book was given to my daughter and daughter in law at the recommendation of their sister/sister in- law. Both women seemed pleased to receive it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Start a new family tradition with one of the best Christmas movies made in a long time.  My husband & I watch this every year while drinking our “hot, hot, hot” chocolate and homemade cookies.  We absolutely love this movie.  Highly recommend.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Great movie, loved every minute of it., but I'm also biased, because I like  Johnny Depp's work. Recommend this to anyone who's into great anamation.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was an extra Christmas treat!  We have had Amazon Prime for years just for the free two day shipping...especially at Christmas time.  It totally pays for itself!  No traffic, crowds, parking, or bags to deal with and I get to comparison shop online in my home with the fireplace on, wearing pajamas, and a cup of coffee!<br /><br />I have been wanting to watch Downton Abbey and didn't know where to go to see it...and it shows up on Amazon Prime for free!  My daughter and I watched both seasons through my son's XBox between Christmas and New Year's while it rained outside.  Totally wonderful and I had no idea this was available to us!  This HD version was great and I would tell anyone to watch this amazing series.  It is set in an era we don't see portrayed often: early 1900's when electricity, telephones, and &#34;motor carriages&#34; were just coming on the scene in homes...along with women's suffrage.  Can't wait for January 6th when it premieres on PBS...although, we will have to wait to watch each episode every week.  Watching the series on Amazon Prime, we were able to watch one right after the other, so we got totally spoiled!
B008RC72G8|4.0|Interesting movie,  I enjoyed it, but others in my family were a bit disappointed. but what's important is that I liked it.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|This movie how it all started of the tall man how going after a young boy who see things that is not there.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Have'nt read it, it was a gift for my wifes kindle.  I may read it if I can get the kindle away from her.
034580404X|4.0|I wish the books were in hardcover, but paperback is fine.  After reading the books, they didn't fit in the box they came in.  The product came in a timely fashion and in good condition.
B008O037RG|5.0|Top shelf. I also downloaded Jerry Douglas version of The Boxer with Mumford. Can't wait to see how they do at the Grammys
B007SYWFRM|2.0|this app is great and addicting until you have to start paying for stuff 10 minutes into the app and for every 2 minutes after that...my daughter got sucked in and then we started having a lot of issues with the game freezing up our kindle and we had the hardest time figuring out how to log off the game and the the app just crashed all together and would not reinstall... my daughter was so upset Bc she lost all her progress her money her points and she was up to level 50 with millions of coins and almost a years worth of progress....so if you want to deal with a headache get this app if you don't want to struggle then I suggest u don't get it.
1451648537|5.0|I think Walter did the late Mr. Steve Jobs justice in portraying one of the greatest men of our time in this biography.  It's well-written like his previous works and is hard to put the down.  I highly recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|When I first noticed that my Kindle offered the Google app, AFTER HAVING IT ALMOST A YEAR..LOL, I thought, &#34;well I will get it but I bet it is slow and has lots of glitches. WRONG! i love it. Now I do not have to carry my big laptop with me when I go to clients and so forth. I can quickly research what ever I want , right from my kindle and it even has LITTLE EGG tabs such as MAPS, VIDEOS, IMAGES, RECIPES,SCHOLAR,FACEBOOK,ANSWERS AND SO ON...
0763644765|3.0|as a parent, not very good reading.  Also, the fact that the baby is butt naked doesn't help since my daughter copies and even when it's cold, if she tries the potty, she wants to strip down.
B000Q67876|5.0|Bought the blu-ray book packaging version for $8 from amazon and received the package just now. I opened it and got blown away by the book material inside. Nice photographs from the movie, lots of information about the actors, darabond, stephen king... Has to be the best purchase on Amazon. I don't know about the quality of the blu-ray encoding but others have said it's pretty good. Frankly, I don't care. The booklet itself is worth $8.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I heard of Downton Abbey but didn't catch any of the episodes. The series is beautifully done in sets, costumes and casting. Even my husband who began disinterested, couldn't wait to see what happened next. Well done!
B009IF82SK|5.0|Started watching this show after it started showing up in syndication over many stations.  Watched the pilot when it first came out and wasn't terribly impressed.  Often times you have to give a show a few viewings to see if you really like it, and this show is an example of that.  Never miss it now!
0452289963|2.0|This book may have good points if you can get through the drawn out verbage, it was too deep for me.
1608862771|5.0|I've followed his blog for ages... this book allows a real close up look at his amazing imaginative artwork.  If you like surreal art... you'll love this little book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of those fun mindless games to kill the dead time. Highly recommended to any one, young or old! Woohoo
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Interesting concept, but turns out to be far less about time travel and the paradoxes it could create than about violent, nasty people who don't shrink at killing adorable small children. The main characters all deserved what they got. The inclusion of a demonic child covered with blood did nothing to add to this film. Go watch &#34;Inception&#34; instead.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game drives me crazy sometimes but is so addictive.  I just have to kill the pigs and it is so hard for me to admit defeat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is a very fun and interesting game. the scenes are very interesting and a little spooky. had a lot of fun and had a hard time putting the game down .
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I saw the book in my recommended section and read the review and was immediately interested. I got it the next morning since I had finished a previous book the night before and wanted something else to read. After the first chapter you are immidiatley hooked. You get thrown into world were you immidiatley want this sheep herder kid Thor from a small village in the southern province of the Ring to become more than he ever imagined he could ever be and more than almost everyone else thinks he can be. If you like magic then you'll like this book and that's initially why I bought it but also you mostly have a tale of friendship, chivalry, treachery, love, destiny, tension, joy, brotherhood, and Thor's ultimate dream of becoming a Silver ( basically a knight). However he is continually faced with a new side of himself that has amazing power but he has no control over it yet and the only person who seems to have any answers is the king's Druid, Argon ( if you want to get into achretpes he's basically Yoda a riddler this one is). Anyway Argon knows more than he's letting on but sadly in the first book Aron never really teaches Thor anything about his power and Thor never tries experimenting with it or anything which kind of made me sad because I really would like to see how it works and everything and see Thor become a total BAD A$$ and kick anyone's butt that tried to hurt his friends or the kingdom. However obviously you learn at least enough in the first book that it is obvious this will be added later to the bigger plot of the story. Anyway buy this book it is more than worth three bucks. Also  this book was so good I finished it in a day the story never gets slow and this series will dig into your very being with each word you read and you can't help but fall in love with the characters, despise the villains, and relish in the adventure. BTW thanks for reading my review hope you like this book as much as I did and I'm sorry if my lack of a proper comma placement annoyed you. :)
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Good action movie. Tom Cruise is in his classic MI form and there's a fairly good plot. Definitely worth watching.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|Very predictable plot and storyline.  Acting was plodding and tiring.  Would not pay for this movie, catch on prime when it is free.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This movie surprised me. I loved the theme of &#34;worn tired love&#34; pitted against &#34;fresh first love&#34;. It was sad, funny, and entertaining. I recommend it!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|At 9 yo, she loves Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman. This complete set should keep her entertained for a looong time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book a lot, I was engaged the whole time (which is what I need in a book). The middle was excellent and then it kind of died off and the ending was disappointing, but looking back on it, it made sense for the characters, it is what they would have done.
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|Many viewers unfamiliar with the films and novels of Cronenberg and DeLillo (respectively) will most likely hate this film. For me, DeLillo became my favorite modern American novelist about three books into his chronology of works. Cronenberg matured into a heavyweight film director about halfway through his career. A match-up of these two gifted artists seemed inevitable to me. The novel \\"Cosmopolis\\" by DeLillo felt like the perfect project for Cronenberg to explore with his off-center sensibilities. I was not disappointed. The film is absolutely mesmerizing. I will express no more about it other than to note its only fault, which is the absence in the film of DeLillo's outdoor macram&eacute; of naked bodies in midtown Manhattan. Thus, I rated the film four rather than five stars. Believe the negative reviews if you wish. But if you pass on this startling work, the loss is yours.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|Such a great show.  Most women can connect with at least one of the ladies.  This show is a great and entertaining diversion from our own lives.  Love it!
B008Y2D2RY|5.0|Wonderful story, beautifully shot, does not get old. Highly recommended. Saw it over 30 years ago and it does not look dated.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Absolutely love this CD.  We've seen Jersey Boys 4 times in 4 different cities.  Can't seem to get enough of Frankie Vallie & the Four Seasons.  Quality is excellent.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander shares an insightful spiritual journey validated by his medical background.  How he interprets his journey is personal, so no judgement on that.  And while this book has interesting and thoughtful moments, I believe it would be more suited to a featured magazine article.  But maybe that's because through faith, I don't require any proof of heaven.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|intriguing & fun.  Makes you think a little while having lots of fun! Completely lost track of time while playing
B0089XH38M|5.0|So far so good.Seems to be working. try it you will like it as much as l do. and other people l know.
1455121924|4.0|Very informative and eye-opening. I found many of the chapters repeats itself which is why 1 star was deducted. Thank you for the research and I will be adjusting my diet for sure
B002LMV7TS|5.0|This movie is always good around the holiday to keep those kiddos entertained! Jim Carrey is funny and delivers an award winning classic movie!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Clever writing, excellent acting, and truly scary horror.  It's unfathomable why this show doesn't get more attention.  It's better than the X-Files ever was.  HIGHLY recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has out done herself! Every character draws you in to the story she is weaving with plot twist and turns. Loved this book!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I wish especially to recommend this book to all medical doctors for the insight to the difference between seeing and observing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I own every live action Batman movie. This collection is superb. The only problem i had was that they had to reship the collection because it never arrived. Once i got it though i was ecstatic! Must buy for people of all ages.
B001P5M7QE|4.0|Perhaps the most famous Monty Python movie ever. Picture quality was decent, sound quality was ok. While they print maintained the classic feel, I think I would like for the movie to receive a bit of a update to the picture quality and the sound. But, at the end of the day, it's Monty Python which is always great.
B006X415GK|5.0|Completely new and I've left her in the box for display. Thank you for the good price. She's great for a collector.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I did like the book for the most part. The author has a good writing style, however, the characters seemed a bit one-dimensonal. Also, particularly toward the end, she lost track of some characters or re-named them. A good editor would have caught that. The book probably ended two or three chapters too soon. All the ends were not wrapped up. Perhaps she is planning a sequal.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is great, of course I love all college films & anything acapella.  Rebel Wilson is fantastic as the aca-awkward (haha) &#34;Fat Amy&#34;.  That girl from Twilight is just as good an actress and probably a better singer than Kristen Stewart could ever dream of.  And the blonde from True Blood (all I know her as is Steve Newman's wife...I know I should have researched before writing this review!) plays the character perfectly.  I watched the final Breakfast Club mash up like 3 times.  It was inspired.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was a great product - we bought several of them for our grand kids and they really loved it!
B004I744AS|5.0|I love the word games, especially Match Up, and all the other areas of information. The horoscope is not for me.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Admittedly after reading the reviews I was somewhat dubious about purchasing this book. But what the heck, two books for 10 bucks. Anyway as more of an action Lee Childs, Kellerman fan I found \\"Iq84\\" to be a GREAT read. Highly recommeneded
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I loved every bit of it! I can't wait to read the next one. Phenomenal
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even begin how to describe this book. I don't think there will be another book as amazing as Hopeless. I'm not going to write a long review... Just read the story of Sky and Holder! You'll be blown away!
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Really like this little cube. It's quiet, actually has plenty of space inside for storage and video, Decent PSU, and it's been reliable for about two years now. Was able to run it with a Bluray, two HDs, one SSD and a Radeon 6850 without problems. A 500 watt PSU is available if you want to run a faster video card. Recommend this to anyone who wants a quiet, classy little computer sitting on their desk.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm hooked on these games. My wife and I both have this and it's becoming a competition between us. I would recommend this app for everyone. I'm a fan.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love the love story. Katniss and Peeta are meant for each other. I only hate that you have to endure all the brutality in order to witness the beautiful part.
1593974744|5.0|Love it, good condition. Was a gift and really enjoyed. Not in a cd case, in a larger almost vhs case but it is well protected
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Got tired of waiting in line for months at the library to borrow, so bought it for myself. What more can be said about Downton Abbey? Such a great series!
B0032O6S4I|4.0|My daughter is obsessed with animals (she moves the people out of every dollhouse so the zebras and dinosaurs can move in), so I thought this would be a good Christmas present. I did think it was a bit pricey for what was included (many parts of the zoo pictured in all the advertising must be purchased separately), but that's pretty much the way with Playmobil. My daughter's favorite features are that the animals come in sets of mothers and babies, which is very important in her mind, as well as the different foods that come with it to feed the animals. She was concerned that the giraffe and zebra enclosures didn't come with any little shelter (the other enclosures did), but we fixed that by adding a small box/&#34;barn&#34; to the scene. As always, Playmobil sets come with many tiny parts and could use better assembly instructions, but if you're okay with that, I think you'll be happy with this product. I plan to pack up as many parts as possible when my daughter gets down with it and save them for grandkids; thinking of the purchase as a potential long-term toy-investment makes me feel less guilty about the price-to-product ratio you get.
0761171703|4.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend.  My only disappointment was that hard cover was not available.  It's still a nice coffee table book, but hardcover would have been better.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|it is not as good as I thought if would be. so please make it where I don't need to put my password for my amazon account when it is free.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Fast paced, page turner, suspensful, great ending. I've read all of the Pendergast featured novels and loved them all.  The whole backstory of pendergast is really interesting and also scary.<br />Highly recommend this book to anyone that likes this genre.
0142420891|5.0|I read both books and loved the story it was a touching story I cried and laughed so much the first book lead into the second very well
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My granddaughter is now almost 4 and carried this doll around for the better part of 3 years.  She has just now started leaving her behind sometimes, but for awhile had to take her everywhere.  I got this doll for her as a baby and it quickly became her favorite.  She named her Mimi and carried poor Mimi everywhere with her.  She cleans up beautifully, but due to serious loving by a 2-3 year old, we have had to replace her clothing frequently.  The original clothing washed well a few times, but then it just wore out.  We were able to find inexpensive replacement clothing at Walmart that fit well and was more &#34;disposable&#34; than the expensive clothing sold for this doll.  The doll itself has been washed numerous times and has held up really well.
0345803485|5.0|this was the best book I have read in a while it has got me into a lot of New authors and I have really fell in love I look forward to this author writing more
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written, wonderful character development, and I lost two nights sleep.  This is an engaging story wrapped in a difficult subject AND it's full of hope.  I am now looking for anything Ms. Hoover writes because I am always transported to the world of her pages!!!!!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|this is the only thing i have ever rated 5 stars. realy thick, heavy and just a great size, not big (long) like the normal big knives( witch are useless). i have a cold steel,and, a knives of alaska knife and this bk2 is by far better, this is the frirst knife i have ever had that feel like it is part of me ( if that makes any sence). already had to go to the hospital becouse of this tank ( 4 stitches on my thumb) This knife rules!
B009NOGSQE|4.0|This movie was very good. It's hard to make sequels that are as good as the orig but they came really close. It was a very good movie
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I always seem to approach these movies with high hopes and I always think surely this is the last one. But I always seem to be wrong. They just keep going and going and going. Please next one be a really really good finale that makes it all worth it!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I DON'T  READ A LOT.BUT THIS BOOK BLEW MY MIND.<br />I'M STILL NOT HOW IT ENDS. GOT TO GET ANOTHER<br />BOOK BY LEHANE.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|A good story about questioning what is reality. While this is more heavy handed than most of his other writings; it is still a very enjoyable read.
6305754969|1.0|I ordered El Dorado with John Wayne and as a Christmas gift for my Grandfather, but when he opened it, a completely different movie was inside! Absolutely disappointing. I have no idea why this happened, but I know I will not order from this seller again.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Easy to download and app works great! Actually works better than my Mobil FB app! Def recommend this app !
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|A lot of great action. Car chase scene was great. As good as the original or better.<br /><br />The new TOTAL RECALL is a must see!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Bad storyline, boring, only good part was the last 10 mins when it was setting up for the next sequel.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining and satisfactory length (several hours).  Story was very engrossing but may be a bit dark for some players.  Music went well with the storyline. Voice characters were very well acted.  Good balance of HOG and puzzles. I really enjoyed playing.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Am intrigued with Gillian's writing ability.  She has a young and interesting style.  The book is well written and I will buy other books by this author.  I am glad I purchased it to try as finding new and exciting authors is always a coup.
B0093QFM6Y|5.0|Acting is superb.  Music sublime.  Picture quality excellent.  I can't wait for my blue ray order to arrive.  Have never watched a blue ray movie before.  Can't imagine any picture could be better then this HD version.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game drives me nuts playing it but I love it. I get so excited playing it. My daughter and husband laugh at me when I play it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|i think this game is probbably the best game i have ever played on the kindle fire. amazing visuals combind with the god of war feel (if you use the warlord) i highly recommend this game to anybody that likes RPS&quot;s or likes passing time this game is for you. five stars from me.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is great I play it with friends and family. Its very addictive ad I love it very much.!
B005LAII1C|5.0|this movie makes me cry because I'm laughing so hard. Even if you don't love Family Guy you will be rolling on the floor
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. My two year old grandson loved it too.
1451695195|5.0|Yikes, science and faith work together?  Finally, a neurosurgeon's point of view of Heaven is opening the field  to more and more of that  &#34;final frontier&#34; of education.  Why I say &#34;final frontier&#34;-- it is the peak level of the scientists' education of earning MD+ and who have pushed away Biblical truths as nonsense due to being difficult to prove. Many of us who know the TRUTH are rejoicing to see this book printed.  In fact, the author was interviewed on TV a few weeks ago!<br /><br />Eben Alexander had proof of his serious condition(s) at the hospital and even they thought he would never recover!  He is living a miracle of God showing us that Heaven and miracles go hand in hand.  I was even amazed at the miracle God bestowed upon Eben and rejoiced that he had this unusual experience of seeing Heaven and coming back to tell us about it.<br /><br />Scientists and educators now have a book proofing without a doubt that there is a Heaven--after all, one well educated gifted doctor lived through a near death experience to come back and shared with the world his unique and true adventure!
B009K45Y62|5.0|Loved this movie.  Wasn't real pumped to see it either.  Loved \\"Batman Begins\\".  Not a huge fan of \\"The Dark Knight\\".  Never been more glad that I saw a movie in the theater.  There was an interview with Christopher Nolan a year before this movie opened.  He asked \\"how many good third parts to a trilogy can you name?\\"  He went on to talk a little about \\"Return of the Jedi\\".  I think he studied the heck out of that movie and the Star Wars trilogy in general.  And he learned a good lesson.  I think he saw the trick with the structure.  \\"Jedi\\" is really nothing more than the plot of the first Star Wars (Episode 4) rehashed, only done on a much larger scale with better effects sequences.  \\"Rises\\" is identical in overall structure and basic plot as \\"Begins\\" -- right down to a mirror surprise \\"reveal\\" just before the climax.  But here's the trick: no way is \\"Jedi\\" as good a movie as \\"Episode 4\\".  \\"Rises\\" is not only every bit as good as \\"Batman Begins\\", but in many ways it's better.<br /><br />Two things stood in the way of my loving the second installment: 1) as good as Heath Ledger was, that was not the Joker as I think of him -- sure he was menacing, but there wasn't a joking bone in that performance -- and funny can (and should in his case) be scary too; and 2) there's not one rousing sequence in the entire movie -- yeah, bring on the seriousness... but this is Batman -- shouldn't I have a little bit of fun watching it?<br /><br />I found everything about Nolan's adaptation of Bane to be utterly frightening.  The effects are nearly flawless in sequences that are among the most rousing I've seen in a long while.  And on top of that, I had originally felt the title to be one of the weakest I'd heard in years.  It seemed like a cop-out.  Why not just call it \\"Batman Rises\\" to tie the trilogy together?  It seemed as though it was a lazy marketing ploy to cash-in on the tremendous success of \\"The Dark Knight\\".  Okay... so, I was wrong.  By the end, not only had Nolan madeperfect sense of his title, but even improved my opinion of the previous installment.<br /><br />The quality of the transfer is excellent, and this is one of those special blu-ray discs -- in that the sound is something special.  Listen to it loud and let Bane's voice rumble through your floorboards.  Oh, yeah... and the broken cowl that comes with this special edition is pretty cool too.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great story with interesting characters. I'm excited to read the next two books in the series. I recommend this book.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Let me emphasize that again: if you don't like this movie... then I am sorry, but there's just no way of convincing me that you've got a soul.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good detail with the suspention; of disbelief.  JacK Ryan Jr. is as good as his Dad.  There are many villans.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in one day! Just when you have it figured out, it throws you in another direction. I love this book for soooo many reason. It is HIGHLY recommended,
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I had a hard time putting the book down because its so easy to relate to Charlie. I felt like I was reading about my life. Beautiful book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|much more than I was expecting !!!!! Incredible set and blue rays, thank you for this material and waiting for other batman´s products
B005LAIGRS|5.0|was very pleased and received item as expected. this is an excellen movie will oder more in the future again
B008CX2A2I|3.0|Device was not compatible with my Onkyo receiver.  Small neat package that I really wanted to use bluetooth devices to stream audio..
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Extremely well written! A non stop page turner with passion, excitement, compassion, and lots of emotions. This trilogy was absolutely one of my favorites by far! I will definitely recommend reading all three of these amazing books; you definitely cannot read one without the other two. Great read that I did not want to end. Great work E L James
0307577589|5.0|This is an excellent book.  I was excited to listen to it.  The reader was great.  I received the book on time and in the condition promised.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Talk about not being able to put a book down.  Absolutely loved it.  But you are caught in a dilemma - you can't wait to finish the book, but you don't want it to end.  I have never become so attached to characters.  Ay this point in the trilogy the characters have become so close to you that you find yourself enraged and just wanting to protect them.  I am one of those people that just reads to get to sleep, but that seriously backfired with this trilogy.  Also, I never understood how my mother could read a book over and over - now I understand.  My husband was so sick of me telling him about this series that he started reading it.  LOVE IT!
0316113506|4.0|Over my head and somewhat beyond the reason that I purchased it.  It is going to take me a while to digest it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Seriously, the price you pay for this game is so cheap considering all that you can do!! My boyfriend and l play this literally day to night. Worth every penny spent I promise!!! &amp;&amp;&amp; this is my first time ever playing mine craft and I'm addicted. It takes a second to get used to the controls but after that...
B004ADH1RI|5.0|this provider is the fastest provider I`ve ever had who has given me the correct order. they were also cheap and trustworthy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent! I can't wait to read the next book in the series!<br />These books have turned me into e reader again!
B009HSPODE|3.0|Title: Dear Life by Alice Munro<br /><br />Alice Munro is of course a first rate writer. What I miss is both a little more drama, and above all, a little more humor. Life is both drama and humor, at both ends of it!<br /><br /> I sometimes get the feeling that life in Canada around the Great Lakes is mostly awfully drab.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Was amazing really liked it could it be better no it was really good was it  romance book sure I guess. Why would I recommend this book yes of course I really liked it. It was nicely planed.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Really bad! Not much more to be said about it! It should've been called &#34;The Have Beens' Last Hourah&#34;. Don't waist your time....
B0072NWJRK|4.0|It was a good/interesting story, but it was clearly difficult to follow because of all the characters that one has to keep track of, plus the Chinese names were difficult to remember.
1451695187|5.0|Bought for my girlfriend after hearing about author & book on NPR. She is a big reader of spiritual literature. Gave her 4 books for Christmas, 3 she chose and this one I chose due to the interview on NPR. Of the 4, this one she couldn't put down!!

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Being able to view my favorite horror show on my devices is a pleasure. I can be scared on the go.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This one has a totally different plot that the original movie, but had some &#34;nods&#34; to the original, which I got a kick out of. Nice special effects, lots of action.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Nice to get a first hand report of recent history; revealing details some of which were at odds with press coverage. Excellent insights into Seal training. Kept my interest.
1609611543|5.0|Loved the book and it had a lot of information.  I was raised need wheat fields that where wheat did grow 4' high or higher so he is right, it's changed and I'm sure not for the better.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|Another bloody, heartless mindless foray into the director's cinematic boastful ego. Pointless, falsely moral, no real story, no real characters, no believable plot, racially condescending. Quirky, at times funny and endlessly film-referential, even entertaining. Good Waltz. Good soundtrack. Perfect teenage overlong feel-up date movie and racial revenge fantasy for the simple-minded. Tarantino has been an overrated wasted talent for at least 10 years. Let's hope he hangs it up soon or grows a soul in his bathroom. Pompous Spielberg can keep him company.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austen is a pro at writing about romance, and this book was no exception. Great right to the end!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is innovative, simple and lots of fun even playing same level three time.<br />It has been recommend to everyone.
B002NPUCF8|5.0|This is simply an awesome hard rock album!  If you love Motly crue and Van Halen you must buy this!  This is what music should be!  Slamming guitar solos, lyrics about sex drugs and rock and roll, and lots of Aqua Net!  What else could anyone ask for???
178054068X|5.0|I purchased the calendar for my 13 year old granddaughter and it was a big hit with her.  She absolutely loved it.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I love this movie and wanted my kids to see it since they love anything Will Smith does. They enjoyed his humor and even the serious conflict. Well done.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an intelligent, humorous love story that has become one of my favorite books. Please read it now and pass it along.  You'll laugh out loud and and ugly cry, and afterward be so grateful that you did.
B002NJWHHA|5.0|As a mom of boys I'm often stuck watching some pretty lame versions of dragon movies. This is good enough to sit thru more than once.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the background music, the graphics are great..The addition on the Star Wars characters adds to the game...I found this addition much more challenging then previous additions....I love playing it...
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I just love the series and can't wait for Clifton Chronicles 3. I believe it will be available in March 2013. I actually read the book twice as I couldn't put the book down , so read it far too quickly the first time !
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|It was a very moving story about an ordinary man doing something extraordinary. A shared human experience that connects us. Wonderful.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This product is great! If you enjoy period movies like Pride and Prejudice you would love this! Bought it for a Christmas present for my mom.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|My reading lately has been focused on realistic plots involving politically 'hot' regions. The reverberations between Ryan POTUS and son are bit over baked but didn't change my overall rating.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book in a dystopia series!  Scorch Trials, Death Cure and Kill Order complete the series.  Top of the lists!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very handy app. Just like having a real calculator at your fingertips any time you need one.  I've only had this for about a week but have really used it a lot already. Great price too (free) !
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book is just terrible. The writing is immature and awful and the story lines are unbelievable. I can't believe I wasted time reading this. I also can't get over the overwhelmingly positive reviews which enticed me to buy this book in the first place. People's lives must really suck if they got entertainment out of reading this book. I'm actually seriously questioning the reliability of Amazon reviews in general. Ugh.
B003AMEWMW|4.0|I wascaught up in the wonderful art decco stage settings at first.  As the movie line evolved I came to enjoy the acting between Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) and Amy Adams.  and after a lot of delightful fol der rol a wonderful message appeared in all their lines and most specifically those of the elder statesmen. A delightful period place, played brilliantly, with a one point perhaps a satistactury ending, not life like, but ever so sastisfying
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Great movie  has a few swear words  but Clint Eastwood is awesome<br />his character is very appropriate for his age
B0047VSW30|3.0|The staging and costumes great. But the plot and focus got fuzzy. I couldn't really pick up on the focus of what the movie really wanted to say.
1451627289|5.0|Warning to science-fiction/time-travel fans! --- The structural theme of this novel is one of time travel, and much of the story is devoted to that. Yet, as a veteran reader of science fiction, I can't help thinking that if you approach this book looking for and demanding an exciting time-travel adventure, you will be bored. First and foremost, the book is about people. Historically, culturally, and emotionally, it's about people.<br /><br />With that in mind, climb with George Amberson into his bright red 1954 Ford Sunliner and go for a ride.<br /><br />If you could travel back in time and be given the opportunity to stop the assassination of President Kennedy, would you? Philosophically, the past is immutable and absolute, and to think of changing it is to think nonsensically. But \\"time travel\\" can be used with various meanings. You can interpolate your own meaning into Stephen King's \\"time travel\\" and give his story validity. That is what I did, and when English teacher Jake Epping stepped through a rabbit hole and exited fifty-three years in the past, I had no trouble time traveling with him.<br /><br />I grew up in the late fifties and early sixties, and when I say that Stephen King brings that world back to life, I know what I'm talking about. Nor do I quibble about small errors. For example he wrote \\"barrel\\" when he should have written \\"cylinder,\\" and his facts about the 1960 World Series were imprecise. But despite a few blemishes, his prose is straightforward and very readable. His characters shine with realism, his descriptions are like scenes in a movie, and his assassination facts are reasonably accurate.<br /><br />The ending agrees with my feelings about some important things--for one, marriage--though to avoid spoiling the story, I will not elaborate. I will admit that the ending was happily tearful. So if you follow my recommendation and read this hefty volume, do not let the slow pages discourage you. Go with the flow, there will be fast pages, and the finale will be uplifting.<br /><br />Note: Get the hardcover with the dust jacket, whose backside is significantly more rewarding than the paperback's.the finale will be uplifting.<br /><br />Note: Get the hardcover with the dust jacket, whose backside is significantly more rewarding than the paperback's.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My opinion is that it looks like a great game! I'm getting it right now. Can't wait to  play it! I think from all the other reviews it gonna be really fun. Thanks for listening to my opinion or I guess u could say read my opinion. Also, add me. I'm LovelyLovelyClothes.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This remake of 1990 movie could have been so much more than it was. The city-scapes were really well done and interesting. I was left wanting to know more about the world this movie was taking place in. That is also a fault, as the history of what happened and why certain things were they way they were were never given. Viewers are given a shoehorned exposition at the beginning and left with that. Without spoiling anything, the main transportation device was ridiculous and tainted my viewing of the movie to start.<br /><br />What really made this movie fail in my eyes was it trying to be Total Recall. They could have used many of the same plot devices and story-line, rewritten slightly, and ended up with a better movie. I think it's \\"reboot\\" legacy got in its way. Some of the wink wink nudge nudge moments they tossed in for the fans of the original were so blatant that they came off as insulting.<br /><br />There are some cool ideas and some good special effects in this movie. I don't regret seeing it, but go in with tempered enthusiasm, especially if you loved the original (even with all it's cheesiness).
B009MO5960|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. Not a speck of plot included. Too much digital and not enough reality. Skip.
B002LMV7TS|3.0|When I opened my case, the DVD disc was in an envelope wedged in on the back of the cover (where the booklets go) I found that to be odd because I have never seen that.  I popped in the DVD and it started playing in the middle of the movie, odd again... And the picture quality is horrible!!  No problems with the blu-ray and great picture!  I wish I knew before I opened because it wasn't worth getting the combo pack, we can't watch the DVD format, the picture is too horrible to even see their faces.
B00466HNHM|5.0|My favorite movie is now on Blu-ray and I'm thrilled.  I have watched it several times already and love it each time.

8866134627|4.0|I like much of the thought that went into the design of this notebook. Each page is clearly set up for taking meeting notes with action item space, summary space, etc. I also like the ability to keep a running table of contents in the front of the notebook. If I were to use this notebook only for meetings, it would probably be just the ticket, but I like to be able to only carry a single notebook for all my work. With that in mind, I would not be opposed to having the meeting/project planning pages on one side of the sheet with a plain notebook page on the other side, allowing me a few more opportunities/flexibility. Or have a section just for planning, another with general notes. But I have to see how things go as we move forward. I will give it a fair shot. As with anything, I may end up finding more uses for this as time goes by and will be more pleased with the layout. I'm torn between this and the Evernote Moleskine though I prefer the plain, understated cover of this version.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I gave this game a whirl since it looked interesting. The story is interesting and just when I was immersed in the story, the game ended. I kind of wished it was a little longer, but maybe I am expecting too much from a mobile game. There are portions of the game that are a little frustrating (like where to go next), but it exercises your brain quite well.
B0000009OP|5.0|If you enjoy a bass ridden harmony behind the lyrics with a deep voiced singer in the front ... you will most likely enjoy Morphine. I know I do.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This movie was a real disappointment. I actually stopped watching it 30 minutes into the movie. I was expecting a movie equally exciting as the previous Bourne series. Not so, this movies seems to drag as the back story and plot is being developed. I cannot comment on the last half of the movie because I was was trying to find the 30 minutes of mu life I lost watching it in the first place.
B00005JM02|5.0|The first thing that gets you is how pretty it is.  Then you get into to the story and it's really good, and the characters are fun. Then you find yourself doing movie talk with other like minded people. This is good for adults and kids, everyone, old and little. Things going bad at work, it hits you 'Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming.'  Amazing how it can creep into you vocabulary.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very good for this type of game. Not sure about buying it though but I did enjoy as much as I played.<br />Will check other g5 games.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I bought this movie for the kids and they have throughly enjoyed it.  You can't ask for more than that.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an entertaining and honest look into the life of an American SEAL! Chief Kyle isn't afraid to talk about his success and his failings as a man, husband and sailor.  It's a riveting read that will keep you turning pages.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I really like this movie.  It's fun to watch, it's heartwarming.  I think it will be a classic in time and it's pretty to look at. It's a good story line.  I think it's a must for a collector and kids like it too.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As a long time fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Kay Scarpetta character I thoroughly enjoyed The Bone Bed. Great story line and not predictable.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This is a must for the kids library of movies.  It's a wonderful story, it beautiful to watch. It's great for kids and adults who are really a kid at heart.
B00684J49U|5.0|Love my Grey's. Everyone should own these. Grey's Anatomy is the best Tv show ever. Can't wait for season 9 and pray that the show doesn't get cancelled.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This can be really challenging but at the same time it's entertaining and fun. The higher the level the harder it is.  I like it very much.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Adorable Movie, looked great on Video on Demand from Amazon. Would watch again! The sound and picture quality of the movie was great!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Loved this movie! The action is non-stop and he is a hero you really root for! I can't wait for Taken 2!
B006YC74E8|1.0|eh....who cares about this app.  lots of options but no camera functionality.  if you want to make changes to a picture why not use photoshop?
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect when I got this game, but now that I've played it a few times I do enjoy it.  Can be a little complicating figuring out assembling the Goo, but it's rewarding when you do.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|It's crude immature humor, fart jokes and stoner laughs. My kind of movie, I don't really like Family Guy all that much, but he even points fingers at himself in the movie when he says \\"I do not sound like Peter Griffin\\" so at least he's acknowledging the fact that he's milking it. Anyways, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are pretty funny together. People who don't know who don't know or appreciate Flash Gordon probably will hate this movie. People who don't curse or use curse words as adjectives or poetry will hate this movie. People who don't do drugs of any kind will probably hate this movie. Worth a watch, you probably shouldn't watch it if you take yourself really serious because this is a movie about a teddy bear that does drugs so if this concept bothers you then go away.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Plenty of entertainment. I love the challenges the games give while at the same time the easy understanding of the games. I recommend this to anyone.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|The seller was nice and kind.  The movie was excellent but I can only play it  on my Portable Blu-ray dvd player but not on my regular Blu-ray dvd player.  So therefor I will give only four stars.  I was a bit dissappointed.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was creepy and insane!  I'm not really into &quot;stationary&quot; characters-I like to see them be animated, however, the story was interesting, the scenes just went on and on to different ones and it kept me on my toes.  I wasn't bored, that's for sure.  I didn't expect it to end the way it did-there was nothing wrong with the ending; it just surprised me.  I feel I got my money's worth.  I had no problem downloading it nor did any scenes freeze.  I have a Kindle Fire HD.  Very good game.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I like Tom Cruise and I like Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol (Two Disc Blu-ray DVD Combo.<br /><br />Therefore I will give five stars.  The seller was nice and polite.  I will recomend it to friends.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is my second favorite actor.

B002M7KHO8|5.0|We enjoyed this movie, especially the twists and some clever<br />elements in the plot.  Denzel Washington is great as usual.<br />We had actually seen this movie when it first came out,<br />and we still enjoyed it several years later.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of the movie and I liked the concept. But further on with the scary monsters I got a bit bored. I feel there were so many other ways to have gone with this idea rather than the way they went.
B00012QM8G|4.0|the dvd froze up on me a few times grrrrrrrrr the film was very good. liam neeson played a good part. shindlers list is the closest movie to the holocaust ive seen.
B000VHMF0A|4.0|I got this to replace a CD that got scratched.  This has a lot more songs, longer versions of some of the songs, and multiple versions of the same songs.  I liked my old CD better.  I took the songs I wanted and made my own CD.
B008FPZQQU|4.0|Note: I am reviewing the 3-disc version, which includes the 5.1 mix by Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson.<br /><br />Wilson is a busy man these days. In addition to his working with his own band Porcupine Tree, since 2009 he has devoted a great deal of his time to remixing the King Crimson catalog in new, double-disc versions that include 5.1 mixes in the supposedly dead DVD-Audio format.<br /><br />The results have been, for this listener, amazing. I own every Crimson studio album, but I have bought every updated release. Wilson, working with Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp, has created not one but SEVERAL masterpieces so far, with \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" deserving special mention for the way Wilson reconfigured the sounds for 5.1 without destroying the uncanny ambiance that marked the band's debut.<br /><br />So it came as something of a surprise to me that I have to deduct a star for Wilson's update of \\"Emerson, Lake & Palmer,\\" the group's first album, from 1970. And I feel bad for doing so, because I honestly don't know what the man should have done given the situation he was facing with this one.<br /><br />The problem: Wilson could not locate the multi-track masters for two of the three sections of \\"The Three Fates\\", nor the entirety of \\"Tank,\\" which in my mind are two crucial pieces of this album. The first shows off Emerson's keyboard skills in three specific settings -- organ, piano solo, piano trio. The second, \\"Tank,\\" was an Emerson/Palmer composition featuring a build-up-to-blistering drum performance by Palmer.<br /><br />Faced with something like this, there are three options: 1. Abandon the project, which some think Wilson probably should have done. 2. Use the available stereo versions of the missing sections and drop them into the 5.1 mix -- not at all ideal, but you preserve the track listing and running order of the original album. 3. Do what Wilson did: Substitute other material for which the multi-track tapes were available.<br /><br />So on this three-disc set, we do get one CD of the original stereo album, remastered, and a CD of \\"The Alternate ELP\\" that's pretty much duplicated on the DVD Audio disc. Wilson found a version of \\"Promenade,\\" later to be incorporated into ELP's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition,\\" and a band jam called \\"Rave Up\\" to fill out the missing sections.<br /><br />I know there have been howls of protest over this from other reviewers here. But I think they're being somewhat too harsh. After all, the original album is all here, albeit in a two-channel mix. And we're probably getting the best 5.1 mix we can, unless or until those missing masters ever turn up -- and I doubt they ever will.<br /><br />If you're a purist about this album, maybe this version isn't for you -- although I have to warn you that in missing \\"Raveup,\\" you're missing a pretty fine piece of music in its own right.<br /><br />Frankly, despite the technical problems, I don't see how Wilson and original ELP producer, bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, could have made the decision to SCRAP the band's DEBUT ALBUM from the 5.1 remix program, which is supposed to continue. I'd also point out this isn't the only imperfect 5.1 mix out there; far from it. Many 5.1 releases go back to classic rock albums, and keep in mind the age of the original tapes of those by now! Forty-plus to nearly fifty years. Such tapes have to be baked in special ovens before they can even take a chance at accessing them safely. And of course the worst possibility of all: Not being able to find all the source material. Bob Clearmountain and Rhett Davies remixed Roxy Music's \\"Avalon\\" for 5.1 SACD, and it's an amazing result -- just look at the price third-party sellers are getting for it now, which Amazon will delete if I quote it here, but take a gander. Anyway, one track was missing from that, the instrumental \\"India.\\" Their regular elegant solution was to slowly pan the whole thing right around the room in 5.1, and it sounds wonderful.<br /><br />Final thoughts on the music itself: \\"Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\" was released 43 years ago, but it doesn't sound as dated to me as some records from 1970. For one thing, the band was aggressive and accomplished even at this early stage; all three members play beautifully. And the songs were varied, from the very hard energy of \\"Knife-Edge\\" and \\"The Barbarian\\" to the softer feel of Lake's \\"Lucky Man\\" and the sprawling ballad \\"Take a Pebble.\\" ELP served as whipping post for a lot of rock critics at the time who found them impossibly pretentious, but when you listen back to them now, they just sound like a pretty tight, pretty amazing rock band most of the time, with the jazz and classical flourishes they loved tucked in nicely here and there. This would change over time as Emerson especially led the band on an orchestral obsession that culminated with \\"Works, Vol. 1\\" But that's a different album (can't wait to see what Steven Wilson does with that one). \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" is widely considered ELP's signature work, but this debut was an incredibly strong beginning. If you remember it fondly, hear it again. If you're not familiar, by all means, seek it out and experience it, whether in standard stereo or this sprawling version. The bottom line is that there is good, fiery music here.houghts on the music itself: \\"Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\" was released 43 years ago, but it doesn't sound as dated to me as some records from 1970.

B0091Q82L8|5.0|There's been a lot of myth and mystery surrounding this release -- for one thing, it was thought by the Who at one time that John Entwistle's bass track was missing from the entire show, making it impossible to release the performance.<br /><br />Further investigation revealed this was not true -- bass from the first four songs, out of a total of 32 performed, was gone. In the digital age, the solution was simple: \\"Fly in\\" the bass parts from \\"Live at Leeds,\\" the show the Who had recorded the previous night back in February 1970.<br /><br />Two things: John Entwistle was in many ways my favorite member of the Who, and I believe he was the best pure musician of all of them, taking his instrument even further than Pete Townshend took guitar or Keith Moon took the drums. Whether I'm right is irrelevant; I make the statements to make a different point: I can ASSURE you that the \\"flown-in\\" bass on the first songs here are a NON-ISSUE. \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" \\"I Can't Explain,\\" \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Tattoo\\" sound just fine, thank you. Of course, slight adjustments have been made because of variations in tempo and pitch over the two nights; even the Who, concert warhorse that they were at the time, wasn't mechanically perfect, thank God. Anyway, given my high regard for Entwistle, if there were the slightest problem with this, I would downgrade \\"Live at Hull\\" at least one star.<br /><br />Now, on to the band's performance: It's a slightly different animal than \\"Live at Leeds.\\" The latter recording, to which our ears have become so attuned after 40 years (!), does have more ... mania? Adrenaline? Simple urgency? It feels more agitated and wound up than \\"Live at Hull,\\" and of course that incredible energy is one big reason critics have called it the greatest live rock recording of all time.<br /><br />\\"Hull,\\" by contrast, is a bit looser and, one might say, more relaxed. Those attributes sound ... hmm ... less than promising when writing about a Who performance, but keep in mind what I'm saying: It's not that energy is LACKING here. It's just a different tilt; for one thing, I think the band is enjoying themselves immensely. I also think the overall vocal performance by Roger Daltrey might be a bit stronger. Entwistle, as always, plays marvelously, and his performance is quite close to Leeds, which must have made it pretty easy to borrow the bass for those four songs. Townshend, I think, sounds the most measured of all; whereas on \\"Leeds\\" he often seems on the verge of losing control, here he plays it a bit straighter. The result, though, can be more purely musical: I echo the other writers here who have said they prefer Hull's \\"My Generation\\" to the one at Leeds. Townshend just barnstorms his way through it, but with a precision and confidence that absolutely shine.<br /><br />And then we come to Mr. Keith Moon. Yes, the reviewers are right on: \\"Live at Hull\\" represents one of his all-time great performances, and because his drums are up in the mix a bit more than they were at Leeds, you can hear more of what he's doing. And with Moon, there was always more, wasn't there? It's a stunning display of drumming prowess. Keith never could sound \\"relaxed,\\" really, but he was very empathetic with his bandmates, and he plays here with plenty of force but also just an extra notch of ... gracefulness, I guess it is ... that marks this album.<br /><br />Some have called this a \\"warts and all\\" performance, but I keep wondering where all the warts are. Sure, there are a couple of miscues; Daltrey is slightly late back to the microphone on a line of an otherwise excellent \\"I'm a Boy,\\" for example. What of it? That's exactly the kind of thing that makes live performances memorable.<br /><br />The \\"Tommy\\" performance here: This was my biggest fear. After hearing it on the expanded \\"Leeds\\" and on \\"Isle of Wight,\\" was I really going to be able to appreciate yet another live rendering? The answer is yes -- primarily for the reason I stated earlier, that theband just seems so comfortable in its own shoes on this night that it all feels right. Despite the number of times they had played \\"Tommy\\" since its release, and their sometimes spoken weariness with it at the time, the band plays and sings it with absolute, total commitment. Townshend, especially, seems to be having a blast; his vocal sounds even loopier and sillier on \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp,\\" to cite one song.<br /><br />One test of good music is how we can (or can't) return to it, depending on its quality and impact, of course. As I write this, I'm listening to \\"Live at Hull\\" for the second time in two days, after having played it initially a few days before this. It is quite unusual for me, these days, to allot three listenings to an album in one week, even one new to me. This one has grabbed me. I suspect it might just do the same thing to you.band just seems so comfortable in its own shoes on this night that it all feels right.

B009KKLQKO|4.0|The Beach Boys celebrated their 50th Anniversary in 2012 by reuniting the five original members - Brian Wilson, Mike Love, David Marks (who briefly replaced Al Jardine in 1962-63, and played on the first four Capitol albums, while Jardine finished college), Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston, who is technically not an original member, but joined in 1965, after Brian left the touring band for good, stayed until 1972, took time off to write \\"I Write The Songs\\" for Barry Manilow, and then rejoined permanently in 1978.<br /><br />I did not get to see The Boys on tour, but enjoyed the 21 songs on this DVD.  They sound great, although I'm sure there was some \\"sweetening\\" done in post-production.  Unfortunately, the DVD only runs for a little over an hour, and as other reviewers have pointed out, The Boys did well over 50 songs at their shows, so why they didn't put out a longer DVD is a mystery; perhaps Mike Love was afraid that a longer version would not sell.<br /><br />Unless a second concert DVD with the other songs is released soon, this is probably all that we are going to get, with egomaniac Mike Love's decision to fire Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and David Marks after the tour, leaving only Love and Johnston in the band.  Not much Love shown from Mike.  So enjoy this DVD for what it is, and also buy the companion documentary [[ASIN:B008KJZJTK Doin' It Again]], which I received as a Christmas gift, and, in addition to concert excerpts, has some nice interviews with The Boys, including heartfelt reminisces of the late Dennis and Carl Wilson.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Not sure why everything with Seth Macfarlane has to involve fecal matter, or something else outrageously and unnecessarily vulgar.  One case in point was Family Guy's Christmas special hosted by his dad...not sure why anyone needs such specific references to bodily functions, but you will see the same sickness in Ted.  At times it is a very cute movie and some dirty male jokes are fine...but this movie makes you wonder:  That wasn't funny....it actually made me heave...why would a sane person put that in a mainstream movie?  I have the same issue with many of the more recent comedies done by the SNL crowd and National Lampoon.  Some dirt and nudity is fun, but the obsession with detailed bodily functions is disgusting and other movies filled with weird deviant sex often takes the place of a well-developed storyline aimed at entertaining the non-porno folks.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|The conclusion to the phenomenon that is the Fifty Shades trilogy is all that it's cracked up to be. The lose ends are tied up, the character development reaches its peak and the plot is surprisingly action packed. Fifty Shades of Grey remains my favourite installment but Fifty Shades Freed isn't too far behind. This series started off as a hyped BDSM book but has transformed into a full fledged series with substance and memorable characters. I never expected this evolution nor did I expect to enjoy the journey so thoroughly. This trilogy is so much more than just naughty, it's bewitching.<br /><br />This book starts off on a happy note. Christian and Anastasia are enjoying their honeymoon bliss and seem to have resolved their issues. There are a couple of bumps but compared to the challenges that they've faced in the past these are only tiny blips on the radar. However, all good things must come to an end and when they return to the real world their truce takes a nosedive. As with the previous installments, this novel is another emotional rollercoaster. Even though I wasn't always happy with what was going on in the story; I had faith that James would ensure that Grey and Ana finally receive their happily ever after.<br /><br />I was surprised by the scope of this tale. There's enough violence, deception and mystery to justify knocking this book out of the erotica genre in which it's currently shelved. Fifty Shades Freed is so far away from being just about sex anymore that it's crazy when you look back on how this story first began. The evolution that the characters and plot have gone through over the course of three books is staggering. When I first picked up these books I expected them to be high on nookie and for the storyline to be next to nonexistent. Boy was I wrong! This is quite possibly the most warped love story that I have ever read but that's what makes it so good.<br /><br />On the downside, I found that a lot of parts were unnecessarily long and weighed down the action. This book would have benefited immensely from some hardcore editing. The repeated use of the same terms and descriptions finally started to grate on my nerves in this final installment. Fifty Shades Freed is the longest novel out of the three but the entire story only takes place over a few weeks. It felt like so much longer because of the unneeded details. I liked that the side characters got some face time but it was irrelevant to the overall progression of the story and came across as filler.<br /><br />I loved the fact that E.L. James saw fit to include an epilogue; without it the ending would have left me feeling less than satisfied. Another point worth mentioning is that when you purchase this series as a one volume eBook, you also receive two bonus short stories that are quick reads and really add to the big picture.

B007FH9GA6|4.0|The original version of the movie (with subtitles) was better...but this is pretty good.  Read the book first before you watch this!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This second installment is quite possibly my least favorite book of the trilogy. I expected heat and instead received a staggering amount of character development. Not exactly a bad thing, just not what I bargained for from an erotica novel. I've now read the entire series so I can safely say that the first book was sizzling, the second was more vanilla and the third was somewhere in between. Fifty Shades Darker focuses on romance rather than sex and sheds some light on the enigma that is Christian Grey.<br /><br />This novel dives right into the after effects of Anastasia and Christian's break-up. While faced with the very real possibility that he might lose the best thing that's ever happened to him; Grey has no choice but to open up to Ana. We learn about what was done to him as a child, why he doesn't like to be touched and why he prefers submissive women; among other things. Each revelation is more shocking than the previous one and will leave your heart in pieces. This poor man has been a victim his entire life and the only way that he was able to gain some semblance of control was by becoming a tycoon in his professional life and a dominant in his personal one. But appearances can be deceiving; on the outside he's the definition of strength but on the inside... he's as fragile, scared, little boy.<br /><br />Christian eliminates nearly all of his domineering tendencies from his relationship with Anastasia. For the first time in his life he's actually worried about hurting someone. This is the vanilla aspect of the story that I was referring to earlier. In Fifty Shades of Grey this couple's romp sessions were off the charts hot but in this installment they pretty much stick to missionary. I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the more intimate chapters but they simply didn't measure up to those found in the first book. Like their relationship, their sex-capades are evolving. What I did find interesting was the fact that Anastasia initiates some non-vanilla foreplay more than once. Their roles have been reversed! Ana starts to explore her darker desires while Grey shuts his down. I expect them to finally reach their happy middle in the conclusion of this trilogy.<br /><br />The writing is consistent with the first book so if you didn't enjoy James' choppy style the first time around chances are it'll be more of the same. Fifty Shades Darker has a little bit more sustenance in the plot department. The story no longer solely revolves around the two main characters. There's a bit of intrigue and the side characters receive more attention in this installment as well which made for a nice, well-rounded story. This book falls more into the romance genre than the erotica one in my opinion.<br /><br />An enjoyable sequel but markedly different from book 1. It almost felt like two separate stories; the differences between Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker are just so enormous. I enjoyed the characters way more than the sex this time around which struck me as odd considering the whole trilogy is considered BDSM. Fifty Shades Darker is about compromise and going the extra mile for the one you love.ay more than once. Their roles have been reversed! Ana starts to explore her darker desires while Grey shuts his down.

This book falls more into the romance genre than the erotica one in my opinion.<br /><br />An enjoyable sequel but markedly different from book 1. It almost felt like two separate stories; the differences between Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker are just so enormous. I enjoyed the characters way more than the sex this time around which struck me as odd considering the whole trilogy is considered BDSM. Fifty Shades Darker is about compromise and going the extra mile for the one you love.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finally bought the bullet and succumbed to the hype that is the Fifty Shades trilogy. Even though this book doesn't fall into any of the typical genres that I review; I have a feeling that many of my followers are just as curious about these books as I was. Once I started this series I simply couldn't put it down so I was relieved that I opted to purchase the entire trilogy in one easy to read eBook. Fifty Shades of Grey was by far my favorite book out of the three. At first, E.L. James writing style got on my nerves, it's choppy and there appears to be no rhyme or reason behind the breaks in the narration. However, that quickly changed as it became apparent that her points of views are as raw as the characters themselves. This book will make you experience a whole array of emotions; I was scandalized, repulsed, excited and most definitely turned-on. If this novel doesn't get a physical reaction out of you, I don't know what will!<br /><br />The story itself is pretty simple and is easy to follow. There's no hidden intrigue or big reveals. This book focuses on the characters' physical and emotional reactions to each other and various situations. As I mentioned previously, I wasn't a fan of James' writing style in the beginning but it quickly grew on me to the extent that it became an addiction. I finished the first two books in a weekend and they're not exactly small in length. It took me a while to get used to the excessively long chapters and the constantly changing POV. Fortunately, there's really only two characters that narrate so it didn't take long to identify which was which. E.L. saw fit to include the dominant/submissive contract that Grey presents to Ana as well as various e-mail exchanges. I found that these additional elements helped to put things into context and added depth to the characters. I was pretty appalled the first time I read Grey's terms but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Anastasia's inner monologues. She seems to have 3 voices in her head: her subconscious, her inner goddess and her actual self. It felt a little cartoon-ish in the sense that she has an angel and a devil on each of her shoulders but it was a neat way of showing her confusion and uncertainty over pursuing a relationship with Grey. Some of her voices are more humorous than others which also helped balance the angst that's prevalent throughout this story. Grey isn't as much of an open book as Ana but more often than not his body language and facial expressions spoke volumes. He's had something like 15 BDSM arrangements but Anastasia is the first woman who's ever challenged him and pushed him beyond his limits. The changes that both characters undergo are staggering. They're perfect for each other except that it's going to take a lot of trial and error (3 books worth) before they are able to meet in the middle.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is HOT. There's no if's, but's or maybe's about that. I'd never read a BDSM book until I tackled this one so I tried to keep an open mind. I thought the bondage aspect was pretty tame all things considered. It's definitely not your typical romance story but no one gets degraded or \\"punished\\" to the point that I had to stop reading. I've seen worse on TV as I'm sure you have. The first book is a 10 on my hotness scale while as the other two are closer to 7. My only recommendation when reading this novel is to keep your significant close at hand. They will be needed!<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey lives up to its hype. It's off the Richter scale hot, the characters are tangible in their realism and the story's not half bad either. I'm happy that I gave it a try and I strongly encourage others to do the same; if only to spice up your sex life a little!o have 3 voices in her head: her subconscious, her inner goddess and her actual self.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was a good read. Not a wonderful read, but a good one. The plot was a little predictable, and you could see the end coming. Still, I read it through to the end, so it isn't a bad book. I read it because I liked the premise: DA's son accused of murder. It is told from the point of view of the DA, and explores the moral dilemmas this involves. It dabbles in genetics, and the predisposition to be a murderer. Neither the moral dilemmas, nor the genetic side of things is dealt with in any depth, which is why I rate is ok, rather than fantastic. Having said that, it is a good read, and would make the perfect vacation book, when you want to read something mildly interesting, but not too challenging.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|I am a big Ian McEwan fan, and this is one of his best books. I love the way he gives insight into the thought processes of his characters and what motivates them, so that even if you disagree with what they are doing, you understand why they are doing it. His books show a respectful and sensitive insight into the lives of others. This book is no exception.  If you like complex quirky characters and a interesting plot that takes you places you would never expect, then read this book. Brilliant.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Love at first site. Dreams do come true in the end. A very fast read. Very good book good author.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I am often disappointed in crime fiction as I can tell the ending a long way before I get there, but this book kept me guessing. The final twist was fantastic and unexpected.

B00APUYWYA|2.0|It was pretty corny and uncomfortable to watch. It was a second rate episode of Glee. I do not recommend wasting your time.

030758836X|5.0|You read some books on the bestseller list and you go, hunh? Not this one. Gone Girl deserves its place in the pantheon and will be on people's lists for years to come.<br /><br />The greatest strength of the book is neither its intricate plot nor the devious interplay between the characters; it's the language. This author has more than an ordinary gift. She can make the words jump right off the page and bite you with their truth, and with dark humor. Zingers can be found on every page. Reading Gone Girl felt like a weekend on some hallucinatory drug. It made me queasy at first, then just one long high that kept getting more and more intense.<br /><br />More than 5000 other reviews have been written before mine, so I won't bother to summarize the plot. If you read just one book this year, read Gone Girl.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I received the Blu-ray set for Christmas 2012. I put the DVD set in my Xbox 360 HDMI (TV recognized input as 1366x768 at 24 Hz) and put the Blu-ray set in my PS3 HDMI (TV recognized input as 1920x1080 at 120 Hz). A friend and I flipped back and forth between the two versions and saw maybe the absolute, most insignificant quality improvement on the Blu-ray side. Both of us had to convince ourselves that it was \\"a little better.\\" It definitely wasn't a dramatic difference. The TV used was Samsung PN51D450 which is a plasma at 600 Hz with a native 1366x768 pixel field. No A/V receiver was used. If you have a TV that has a native pixel field with higher fidelity, then you may see a difference.<br /><br />Color, sound, etc. were all the same. No difference. One of the cameras used to film Firefly is always grainy. I never understood why that was, but during two camera shots, you can always pick out the grainy one, especially when the scene is very dark. Well, that effect, whether deliberate or not, is still present in the Blu-ray. CGI effects look identical; no molestation of the original content was made.<br /><br />I do enjoy the menu on the Blu-ray much better than the DVD. That sounds like an insignificant thing, but the DVD menu is horrible. I like being able to hit \\"Play All\\" and just walk away and let the audio of this fabulous show swell throughout the house, while I'm cleaning or whatnot. Can't do that with the DVD.<br /><br />Overall, if you have a functional DVD copy, I wouldn't rush out and drop $20 on the Blu-ray, and if you don't have a Blu-ray player, I wouldn't make Firefly your kill-app for one.<br /><br />Oh, and if you've never seen Firefly, you are missing out. It has space cowboys -- literally!

B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Of course, it has all been said regarding this classic movie.  Rex Harrison's role is superb and who could not but love Audrey Hepburn.  Even the musical haters will love  this one!
B008DKBPTO|4.0|Love this envelope. Padded and sturdy. Reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the flower portion of the envelope is like a plastic; I thought it would be cloth. Probably wouldn't have purchased it if I had seen it in a store first. But it's too annoying to return. It does the trick and is cute and girly.
B0000248VB|4.0|Everyone who lived through the sixties and enjoyed the many movies that came out then would appreciate this collection of some of his most well known of his songs.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Not the most gripping story line, but the game is fun.  Some of it could be a little more challenging. All in all for a buck it is worth it. :)
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|It's a good game.  Perhaps not the best out of G5 but not bad.  Kept my interest.  HO were too simple.  Tasks were also not complex enough,  too easy to solve,  but diverting.  The mini games needed to be more difficult as well.  But all in all worth the time I spent.  I'll give it 3.5 stars.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great building game for sure. The fission ability to upgrade units is nice, and the fly-by aircrafts are fun to try and catch for that little bit of cash.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|How can you possibly begin to describe the book that changed so much in one's life? This is epic - but also an epic beginning to so much more than the book. A book turned into a phenomenal play. How can you even rate this product?<br /><br />10 stars.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Just does not have the same feel as the original theatrical release but its nice to have on blu ray.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Recently downloaded this game. Have a hard time putting it down. I would highly recommend this for all ages. My 10 &amp; 5 year old love it as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is full of detail. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. I'm in live with the relationship that the characters have.
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you enjoy Flynn's previous books you will not be dissapointed. If he is not the best, he certainly up with them.<br />Highly recommend.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I understand, but don't like, applications that Force Close on me. I understand that sometimes resources are stretched too thin and so it happens, especially with only 512MB of RAM. Unfortunately, I found that this FCs several times within a 30 minute period.<br /><br />I can tell that the dev put a lot of time and thought into this app. I wish I could select how many keys to show. Also, the MIDI piano sounds appear to have a bit of chorus effect (maybe it's because of the Long sustain I selected). Idk.<br /><br />Tons of potential here. I would like to have been able to use the non-MIDI instruments to determine if this was worthy of a purchase (Non-MIDI sounds are locked in this version and I won't pay for an app just to find that the sounds are good or bad).<br /><br />OVERALL, a good app that needs a bit more attention paid to it, and the ability to hear all sounds *before* I spend a penny.<br /><br />MOTOROLA DROID X
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever, once you got started with the first episode you wanted to keep watching and watching.  It kept you on the edge of your seat.  When you thought it was gonna end one way it was totally different then what you expected. Great show, can't wait to watch season 2

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I am not typically the type to purchase music from reality tv. However, Phillip Phillips is the exception. I bought the album on a whim due to its great price. I had sampled it a time or two prior to my purchase but I wasn't too interested. Seeing that it had dropped to $3.99, I gave in. I am so happy that I did. His voice is great and the sound of the album is like a mix between Mumford and Sons and Dave Matthews. It's great! Every song is well worth it. I think this is the only the beginning of a good thing. The best is yet to come!!

B000ICXQS8|5.0|This was an awesome movie, that shows the struggle of gay people. I would recommend it to anyone, and everyone who is willing to open there mind and see it for what it is, a love story.
B000IZA9OE|4.0|This movie is in fact South Park \\"bigger, longer, and uncut\\", frankly if it were me, I would have cut a couple of small details that to me seemed a bit too graphic, even for South Park. Nevertheless, the film is rated R and this was made back in the late 90's so the creators had free reign to do pretty much anything.<br />The songs are by far the best parts of this movie. The musical numbers not only move the story along, but effectively showcase the personalities of the characters as well.<br />South Park's unique style of animation is not for everyone, since it is about as crude-looking  as the content itself is crude. I personally love the construction-paper-cutout look of South Park, but some may disagree.<br />I give this film 4 out of 5 stars because to me it would've been perfect had the writers focused more on the comedy and a little less on satire. South Park's brilliant comedic elements were present the first half of the movie, the second half I found to be rather boring and preachy. After Kenny's death, the movie seemed to go downhill from there.<br />If creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone choose to end out the series with another film, I would not hesitate to go see it, especially since they said in an interview that if there is to be another film, Butters would play a bigger role. :)
B000JML90Y|4.0|It is an enlightening book on a subject well known in science.  It is interesting to read the original treaties of a noteworthy scientific research.  Understanding the roots of the concept of natural selection increases understanding of the concept and provides facts for discussion.

B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore's music is the definitive audible representation of Middle Earth.<br />His score for Peter Jackson's film trilogy The Lord of the Rings is one of the most iconic ever! His soundtrack for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey equals, if not rivals, his previous wins. Prepare to be transported to the Misty Mountains cold with Richard Armitage's fantastic song \\"Far Over The Misty Mountains Cold\\", and prepare to just get blown away with the amazing Hobbit Theme!<br /><br />I love this music, and can't get enough of it!!! 5 Stars!

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased this case through Amazon for my daughter's iPhone 4S.  Within 1 week of her having it on her phone the cover for the charging area broke.  I called LifeProof to see what they would do and had to give them the numbers on the inside back cover and side front cover only to find out the product I have is a counterfeit product and therefore, they will not cover it.  They informed me that I needed to call Amazon to get a refund on my purchase and that Amazon has been very good at refunding people's purchase price because they are aware of their counterfeit product.  When I called to get my refund, they couldn't find my purchase (I was calling from work without my order number).  I asked the young lady attempting to assist me if she was okay knowing they were selling a counterfeit product and she said she wasn't and would make her managers aware of this.  My trust that they didn't know about this is slim to none!  I am now questioning every purchase I made this past holiday season from Amazon and any other purchase I made.

0321857895|5.0|Two of the last fifty books I've purchased have been physical books, and The Sketchnote Handbook is one of them.  This is the kind of book Seth Godin would refer to as a \\"souvenir\\" if there ever was one.  The book itself is gorgeous; clean, well-designed with thick pages and rounded corners.<br /><br />I've been a longtime fan of Mike's work, and I had preordered the book.  I've seem him take Sketchnotes at conferences, and marveled at how concise and clear the content of his notes were (all the while making beautiful art).  The book does a real articulate job of explaining the process he uses to make Sketchnotes.<br /><br />As Mike states in the book, Sketchnoting is not just about making pretty notes (although Mike's notes are always pretty).  It's about distilling information to its core points.  Ideas, and not art.  The book is essentially one giant Sketchnote itself.  While you can breeze through all 200 pages quickly, the information contained within is rich and deep.<br /><br />Sketchnoting is a highly-personalized practice.  Mike showcases a number of other Sketchnoters and their work, and looking at other styles was very helpful and encouraging.  Even looking at Mike's first stab at Sketchnoting, and the evolution of his style was really interesting.<br /><br />Sketchnoting (and art and learning) is a practice, and one that I'd like to improve at.  My book is now filled with scribbles as I attempt to become a better Sketchnoter.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|The story of Lincoln's political life is gripping and surprising--he's much funnier and craftier than I had been taught.  He had astonishing abilities: to keep his enemies close, to persevere through war and personal disaster, to stay morally centered.

B003QP4NPE|5.0|this is exciting, thrilling, breathtaking novel for everybody, twice as much for geeks - the author really knows what he talks about. But it is so much more than that. It reveals a lot about how our current society works, how much it depends on all kinds of technologies and how vulnerable it becomes because of that.  It makes us realize that ruling today means having access to data - and how dangerous it may be if somebody decides to manipulate the data for his own purpose. This is new (and much better) George Orwell for me. I would make this a mandatory reading for secondary schools all over the world.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|The main characters are likable albeit a bit immature, but the story is interesting enough and now I'm waiting for the second book, just to see his point of view.

B004EPYZSK|1.0|This was recommended by a family member but we did not like it at all! Will read reviews more closely in the future.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|A Christmas gift for my 21 year old daughter.  She specifically requested it.  We were both very pleased with the item.  She loved the box !
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Love this timeless story! Downloaded after watching Disney's version with Jim Carey.  Best version I have ever seen.  Wonderful story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|At some points the descriptions were unclear, with so much action going on. But like the last two, I couldn't put it down. In the end there's a good message and I loved the series overall.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was forced to purchase Homeland because neither Netflix nor Hulu has this amazing show. Nevertheless, I thought it was $18 well spent. At least it's cheaper than buying the first season on iTunes. And $18 for 13 episodes plus commentary that you actually OWN instead of borrow is not bad at all in my opinion. I did purchase the standard def version instead of the HD one because my eyes do not need the flattery of more focused image and better resolution for over $10 more.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As with most of Tom's novels, this story is tedious getting started but it is necessary to set the scene. In my opinion, every American should read this book because we all need to know what is going on in the cyber world today and what a danger it presents for the security and economic well being of our Nation. Many Americans believe the government has no right to invade their privacy but we all need to hope and pray that our government is on the wall keeping watch so the nations that hate the United States never gain the upper hand and are able to destroy what our nation stands for.
B008D490F6|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Flight of the Navigator again!  It was a blast from the past.<br /><br />I would also like to thank an Amazon customer associate personally. Her name was Debbie and she was very courteous and professional.  Her help on purchasing the correct video was greatly appreciated!!!<br /><br />Thank you again Debbie and I hope you have a wonderful new year!!<br />JoAnn
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Captivating book. Couldn't put it down. Not literary genius, but will definitely keep you interested. I would recommend this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun!! Great to help pass the time when you are bored! Wish there were opportunities for free coins : )
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was a wonderful story, appealing to the imagination. However, the story and timeline did get a bit confusing. I do wish the characters where a bit better developed. Overall, it is an experience I feel fortunate to have partook in!
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|This book keeps you guessing till the end. I love the action packed writing style.  Nice to see how Jack ended where he is now. Will recommend this book to anyone that needs a good read.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Eastwood hits a home run with this film. It was everything you expect and more. A great family movie with a feel good ending. Thank goodness; no heavy message. Enjoy.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|For MJ lovers who are tired of seeing the same thing.  This was a different and wonderful surprise.<br />Forever in my heart.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Almost $100 less than an i52500k is a steal.  Had this amazing processor for a while and its great for video editing and very fast for browsing and rendering.  Checking benchmarks its not at all that far behind an i5 2500k and blows away an i3 which costs more.  Here's a couple benchmarks, on Fritz chess 13 this scores 9854 while an i5 2500k scores a 10643, This minute difference isn't worth $100. The fx 6300 which is also cheaper beats a i5 2500k in this benchmark.  Handbrake fx 6100 is at 96.2 while an i52500k 116.5.  Worth $100 extra? Gaming Just Cause 2 maxed  Fx 6100 82.7 fps vs i52500k 85.2 fps no big difference.  This creams the higher priced i3 overall.  Not mentioning the FX 8350 beats the i5 in many benchmarks.  Can't beat AMD's price/performance ratio which is way passmark benchmark always has AMD's rated the best values for the money.  You can spend money elsewhere in your build such as a much better GPU.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I'm a big fan of Marvel comic book movies and this is just one of many hits. I hope more movies like this are coming.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Could be better. But it is fun to play. My son and I enjoy playing it together n the go
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game....ads I simply skip<br />Enjoy competing and challenging other players ...would definitely recommend to anyone who likes solitaire.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Loved this trilogy! The three DVDs came packaged in its own individual cases that fit perfectly into a very stylish box cover. The DVD cases are very slim so storage is not a hassle. DVDs also were great quality.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We rented for our train ride over Thanksgiving out of town. Kids LOVED It. I Loved it. Great family movie about listening to each other, working through our differences, and understanding each other. Great for girl power as well. Sweet movie.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I've been using this on my nexus 7 for six months. Now when I need to reinstall it, all of a sudden, its not compatible? Not cool amazon
B005ANZN3Q|5.0|Not only is the performance in London wonderful but the section on his life is very educational. Wish they would have interpreted the conversations with his parents.
030758836X|4.0|This book was a definite page turner, from page one you wanted to know this man and woman and what happened to them.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Its fun just wish they would come up with version that doesn't require internet. Enjoy playing the game with friends.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Classic Morrison as usually expect the best from him and he delivers the best again and again. So easy to listen to.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The flashlight app works great in a dark room when you do not want to turn on the light. the various color selection is fun, but I haven't found a reason to need it. I have found it best works as an &quot;illuminator&quot;... useage as a &quot;flashlight&quot; is not very good, so if you need to look for something you dropped in the yard at midnight, grab a flashlight.
B0086449YA|4.0|The best of his latest folky sort of music, with his classic guitar of course always from old to new
B004QX07G4|3.0|I LOVE Ellen DeGeneres.  She never fails to make me laugh, but I just didn't get that reaction from this book.  I'm not a literary expert, but I was expecting to giggle my way through this book like I have with her others.  It was still an interesting read though.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|This was one of the best SciFi movies I have watched in a long time!! The plot was simply brilliant and executed in way to keep you glued to your seat. I never saw the ending coming and thats the way I like it!! : )
B003Z0D4SM|2.0|In only ten percent into this book but I can't seem to continue. I love reading and read books often but this one was not for me.  The reviews were great and many said it was worth the read. Maybe you will find a different result.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This movie was really bad.  With the exclusion of nice looking bodies, this movie had a poor plot and no zing.  I would not recommend it to friends and certainly would not watch it again.  I love, love Matthew and Channing but I am really disappointed in this film.
B000001ESP|5.0|el mejor cd de rush. canciones inolvidables remasterizadas y con muy buena presentación. excelente lo de las letras de canciones en el cd
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Loved this book!! It had a cute surprise ending. It went completely against so many other fairy tales. It made me smile, as well as my 6 year old granddaughter.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|as long as you aren't the type that wants to have an open-book style kindle case, this one is a really solid option.  it's well built and nicely padded, and it's not about to flap open anytime soon.  while the case itself isn't waterPROOF (due to the elastic seal and possibly how they sewed it), the fabric itself is definitely water resistant.  this is important for me as i am a spiller of many things, so having an extra few seconds to rescue the kindle from a deluge of rain/coffee/tea/life is important to me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It wasn't one of the best books I've read, but it was defiantly really good and I would recommend it.
0307346617|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for someone and the recipient LOVED it.  He said that it reminded him very much of his favorite video game, DayZ.  Personally, I hate zombies and the zombie craze going through pop culture right now (at least it's better than vampires, I guess).  That being said, I picked up this book after he had finished and couldn't put it down.  The method of storytelling kind of makes you work a little harder to piece together the facts and come away with the whole story (it worked quite well for this book/story).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book must have been a leafblower in it's former life,because it just 're me the hell away. And the very last sentence... brought me to tears.
B003L77GGK|5.0|was shipped quickly and in perfect shape.. love this series and i was giving it to my daughter as a gift
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Definitely the best book I've ever read. Also the best book of the series! LOVED it! I would definitely recommend this book!
0812992792|1.0|Having worked for a Korean company, been to Korea and also being an avid reader (100 books annually) I was looking forward to reading this book based on rave reviews I had read. But I was sorely disappointed! And in fact, after 150 pages I gave up, decided that life was just too short to spend with these characters, and moved on to Barbara Kingsolver's latest novel. Based on the reviews there are a lot of people who love this book -- but I am just not one of them. But I say, go ahead, and form your own opinion. In fact, better to read War Trash, about a Communist soldier in the Korean War. That is wonderful. And while this book is wildly inventive and a has a brilliant conceit, in the end, I found it just tedious.Enter at your own risk.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Would get 5 stars but needs to fix its multiplayer, won't let me . Play. I'm on a . Kindle fire
B004SDEP38|5.0|I could not live without this app!  It works perfectly in conjunction with Microsoft Office documents.  I now sync all my documents on my cell phone, iPad and PC.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was riveting! Couldn't put it down. You'll grow to love the characters. Literally had me in tears multiple times.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my dad after high recommendations from friends/family. great movie to watch over and over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was great book! I couldn't stop reading it when I started! I recommend this book to anyone that likes a interesting book.
0761169253|5.0|Cheers to Austin for this great read.  Yeah, it's a quick read most people will finish in one sitting.  Yeah, it's things we've all heard before, but isn't that the point he's trying to make?  If you're looking for something ground breaking keep looking.  However, if you're looking for a good primer to get your creative juices flowing after a long dormancy then buy it, read it, keep it, and read it again. This book is full of great ideas and it's in a great format that is unique and motivating without being cheesy about it.  Thanks Austin Kleon.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|A classy, beautifully designed, and very well organized collection from one of our favorite TV series EVER. A definite keeper!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|had no idea on how to play it.instructions were very poorly. it was too confusing i cancelled almost as soon as i got it,
B009JBZH54|5.0|I loved it since the very first time a saw the box, then I opened the case and it was awesome to see all movies an special features discs! 100% recommended even if you are not a batman fan, this is a must have set!
B008602KQI|4.0|well done and the most important parts of the book are faithfully in the movie.  good acting and fast action makes this an easy movie to watch
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I used to ask why they are called angry Birds! lol! I know why now! Game is a lot of fun, but can be a little hard to get thought ! But that's the chance you talk!
096798467X|4.0|This book came highly recommended from a friend who actually built one and they are loving the bread and pizza that they have started making! Can't wait to build this, good instructions for oven!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love Ebay! Go on site everyday, too see what's  new!  The app help to go to site faster! Thank You!
B000T433CO|4.0|What a great story and funny even the husband enjoyed it! Sent it home with additional family members to watch!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love to play game, lots of fun and pass the time quickly, when at a appointment! Thank You Angry Birds!
B008MWBY6W|4.0|When I ordered this bag, the detail page had not yet been created so I had no real idea of the size of this case.  It turned out to be smaller than I expected.  But don't get me wrong, it's still a great little camera case.<br /><br />Size:<br /><br />This bag will comfortably hold your camera with the kit lens attached.  The outside pockets will allow you to bring along an extra battery, a few filters and an extra SDHC card or two.  But that's about it.  For a day trip, when you just want to have your camera handy - it's perfect.  But, if you want to include things like the battery charger, extra lenses or other accessories, this case is way too small for that.  At least for my Sony Alpha A57.  I could fit two lenses in the case if I carry my Sony Nex-5 (much smaller body and lenses).<br /><br />Construction:<br /><br />The bag is well made, with solid stitching and ample padding.  You have two side pockets and one larger pocket on the front.  The front pocket has two interior pockets (for SDHC cards) and possibly room in the pouch section for a USB cable.  The case has a solid, heavy plastic bottom that keeps the bag upright when set on the floor or a table.  The case also includes a short strap that is not only padded and comfortable, but actually long enough to sling over the shoulder or wear cross-over.<br /><br />Now with all that said - this is still a great bag.  Although I probably won't use it for either my Alpha or my Nex - I can see grabbing this to store my action cam and point and shoot camera.  Both fit in the bag comfortably with all their accessories.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Can't go wrong with Taylor Swift! She continues to make Great music, the whole family can enjoy. My 2 daughters are head over hills for Taylor!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie for family and dad.<br />Also, great movie to spread the gospel for Jesus.<br />I love to watch this movie again soon.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Book was ok. Kind of hard to follow at times, especially the way it jumped from Megan's point of view to Connor's. There seem to be huge chunks skipped over, and I don't know that you can qualify this as harlequin with only one mediocre sex scene.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The movie is nowhere as good as the old bourne movies. Little fighting and the story is lame. I wish I could get my money and time back
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I do not know where I would be without it. It makes my Kindle very much like my PC computer
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Watching this movie has become an annual event along with Christmas Vacation.  It's a feel-good movie with an innocence of days gone by.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|If the President watches this series, it must be worthwhile! The best thing about this new and thrilling series is that it is written intelligently and provides a full helping of thrills and suspense. I believe there is also a message for not only the USA but for all other countries. &#34;We need to be constantly alert&#34;. The balance is not to become overly fearful but to raise our consciousness that we all need to play a part in keeping ourselves safe from evildoers. We share a common responsibility to thwart evil.<br />The British actor playing the role of Brady is a perfect casting homerun. He is a master of 'facial expressions' that can make you feel the stress, the fear, the terror and the love that his character struggles with every day. We can all relate to some of those emotions and certainly to the internal struggle of good and evil. Brady is us!
B0000013GS|4.0|This is my favorite album from Outkast, it sounds even better on vinyl, only problem is the cover got kind of crushed the way they shipped it...
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I gave it four stars because of the dynamic between Clint and Amy's characters.  Overall, the baseball theme kept my interest because I love baseball.  If you don't like sports, this movie is probably not going to match four stars.  Justin's performance was lacking and many times I felt awkward for him during some of his scenes.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|This book is a romance-dystopia... a very slooooow romance for a very looooong book.<br />If you are sensitive to profanity, this is not the book for you. For a young adult book, I was shocked by the frequent swearing and numerious f-words! In addition, the couple may not have had complete &#34;relations&#34; with each other, but they did engage in a lot of other &#34;physical behaviors&#34; inappropriate for teenagers.<br />On the positive side, it is relatively well written. Not a big romance fan but there were a few romantic parts that touched me. The beginning chapters of the book (before it became slow) roused very vivid images, which means, for me, I have been pulled right into the story. And what an opening line! Immediately draws you in, stimulates curiosity, emotion and engagement! Much better than &#34;The sky was the color of cat vomit&#34;... :-s
B004856SQ8|5.0|a funny movie with a good cast, thought they should do a 2nd one, but that does not appear to be in the works
B005LAIISU|3.0|It wasn't as funny as the first, sequels usually aren't, but I would not recomend this version for one simple reason, the advertised audio of the Blue-Ray product is misleading as shown on the Amazon website. If you have 5.1 audio capability, and use it, you get a female voice describing the events as they happen. This is irritating to say the least. If you have 7.1 audio capability, you're OK, it is played without the description. If you select Spanish 5.1 or French 5.1, you're also OK, providing you understand Spanish or French. It's the English 5.1 that will drive you nuts. I assume that the Blue-Ray manufacturers want to \\"encourage\\" you to buy a new Blue-Ray player with 7.1 capability, buy a new amplifier with 7.1 capability and buy two new speakers so you don't have to listen to distracting inane chatter.<br />Oh, Scrat was great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Although the book started out a bit slow it definitely made up for it. I read it in just a few hours because I couldn't put it down!!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I love this album. You can just hit play and let it repeat without ever skipping a song. Every song is great.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Can't wait to read the next one! I meant to give it more stars but I can't figure out how to change it
B0018RWD1S|5.0|This artist is sadly missed - there are no substitutions.  Wonderful album, great voice.  Recommend any Amy fan buys this.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|It's a lot of fun. It rocks and rolls from beginning to end. It's a good time to a great time.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Picked this book up and couldn't stop till 4 hours later when it had been read cover to cover. It's a not so classic love story with just the right amount of sappy romance thrown in. I would recommend this book highly and what do you have to lose? It's free!
B003LXSY60|5.0|It rocks, it grooves, it's sexy and it's just pure solid gold. I can't imagine a better album over all.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this for my 9 year old granddaughter, but then discovered that my two 5 year old grandsons had fun too.  So I tried it and had a blast.  I wish there were more faces to chose from.
B0017APPT8|5.0|You know what your going to get when You put these two togeather. It is so funny and none stop.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|A great read!  Heartwarming and uplifting! I Love how Jodi incorporates controversial issues in her novels. You won't be disappointed!
B0076DELIG|4.0|There is no greater LA crime noir character than Harry Bosch. Somehow Michael Connelly conitnues to evolve and enrich him. While the mystery may not be at the top level of Connelly's game - and that's a very high standard - the characters certainly are.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|five stars thank you it was so easy to do thanks Phil is the best if  i knew it was this easy i would of done it sooner

B008MEM24S|5.0|&quot;Where's My Perry?&quot; is an outstanding app, carrying on the original Disney values. The showing thought and work put into making a game (influential to modern society) that is fun and mentally constructive. I can't stress the importance enough of the wholsem ideas and problem solving skills development presented and hopefully absorbed by this expellent app. I hope I have effectively encouraged you reader/listener to enjoy this good and educational app. Have fun!
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Wasn't able too find in store when my daughter & I saw them in concert for our birthdays in june.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We sincerely have enjoyed watching this series, now can't wait for the season 3! This is a great show and I would recommend it.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|bought this for my husband he said that the album reminded him of too many other singers sad but then not your fault
B006HGXGWU|4.0|The leading actor, Michael Shannon is one of my favorite actors and by far I think this is his best role.
B0053O89WY|5.0|this was a great present for a good friend of mine<br />he just loves this show and now he has the complete set thanks
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|This album is awesome! If anyone loves acoustic guitar, music, artistry, and creativity. Ed Sheeran brings all of that to the table. His lyrics are very captivating and catchy. I've been listening to these songs on repeat for 4 days and still love it. Among my favorite tracks are &#34;U.N.I.&#34;, &#34;Kiss Me&#34;, and &#34;Wake me Up&#34;. His music and lyrics soothes my soul. I hope to see more music from Ed Sheeran.
B00942S4OY|5.0|yes this is what an 11 year old does when she gets one direction for christmas she fell in love again thanks
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  Couldn't put it down.  Not sure if I want to see the movie or not because I don't want it to ruin the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good story pulled you in. I read it in two days. Can not wait to read the next book.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Really disappointed. Smart female. Vampire man cares for her against his will. Must protect her! Locks her up & gets mad occasionally, all under guise of looking out for the poor leetle thing. Uff da! Returned eBook unfinished!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I\\"m very pleased with this game. Dec. nothing to improve!! I got this as a free download, but I intend to buy it , it' s a great presentation of electronic game.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|If you like TED Talks, this is an excellent way to access TED Talk videos. From the home page of the app, you can find a number of interesting talks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I first started to read this series of the hunger games I didn't think it would be better than twilight. I was wrong. This is the best ever!!
B004YAS9M8|5.0|Another great cd.  I play this all the time and highly recommend it to anyone.  I do plan on buying his newest cd that will be released later this month.
B000E41MS6|4.0|This is the series with which I started my Who-obsession, given I've noticed others having a hard time starting here. Yes, it can be cheesy, but it's a great intro to the reboot and leads well into the Tennant years. Don't skip Eccleston!<br /><br />Note: I had issues with the Marketplace seller I purchased this set from. The first &#34;new&#34; set they sent me was falling apart and very fishy. The &#34;replacement&#34; set they sent me was missing the outer cover and I'm fairly certain they just ordered a used set from another seller and shipped it to me. In the end I was able to scrounge a complete set and returned the other to the seller, but it was terribly annoying overall. The seller was very friendly and appeared to be trying to work out the issues, but be very careful buying Who DVDs from marketplace sellers (even if they are supposed to be new DVDs). I've read reviews for other seasons by customers suspicious of pirated copies.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This I bought for ME!  I really like it and highly recommend it to others that like Cello and Piano music....I would consider buying more.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|When I got to the Smith years of Doctor Who, I thought he was okay as the Doctor but that there was no way I'd buy the DVDs after season four. I was wrong. Like any new Doctor or companion, they may take some getting used to but eventually I'll love them.<br /><br />I was impressed with the packaging for this one. The outer cover has that holographic/3D looking picture which is pretty cool. The inside looks like the Pandorica from the end of this season. I've read complaints about the blue plastic disk-holding pages breaking, but I haven't had any issues yet. I think the design is actually quite nice. I have the rest of my Doctor Who DVDs in a CD pocket case to avoid scratches, but this case seems to work just fine.<br /><br />Other seasons have the Christmas special included from before the season began but since this was the beginning of Smith's Doctor this one does not. If you're new to Who and are lost as to how the Doctor got from the end of season four to the beginning of season five, don't forget the Tennant Specials that connect the seasons!
B00979CS50|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He is such a Neil Young fan.  He was very happy with his gift....Says he plays it in his car all the time.  I am happy he is happy.  Great gift!
B0002BO05S|5.0|I purchased this video for my Grandma...I also grew up watching movies like this one and it is a must-have addition for any Christian movie library! If you dont have it, Please get it...you wont regret it!
0439023491|5.0|this book was much more developed than the first, and the characters take on a much more complex storyline which keeps you wondering how they will come out of this.  Collins's ability to keep the suspense while delving into ethic and cultural issues in a dystopic universe is bar none
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is very informative and I was able to get some good recipes from it.  I enjoy scanning through the different areas.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It' a fascinating book.  I wish I had more knowledge of medical terms, especially neurological ones. I am still reading it.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|A complete and portable collection of everything Sherlockian. Well organized, well presented. If you love Sherlock Holmes, you'll love this Heirloom version.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Would've been a lot better if Charlize Theron didn't go through the entire movie like a wooden stick figure simply mouthing lines. Noomi Rapace was a redeeming factor, but Guy POearce was wasted on his character portrayl.
0340881542|5.0|My Grandson loved this book. He was very slow at reading and has now caught up with the rest of the class and always has a book in his hand.  This book was recommended by one of my other grandsons I was pleased that Jacob liked it and hope to buy more
B007EE4XKI|1.0|David Mack wasted a lot of time-at least half the book-on a sloppy back story about Noonien Soong. Thre good beginning and the very good ending can't save this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cannot put the book down.holds interest 100 percent. Am able to read in 2days. # 3coming next. Anxious to see next movie
B009LREA1S|4.0|Nolan notches it up in the final chapter of this trilogy.  An epic chapter in the darkly, deliciously re-imagined Batman saga.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I can't put it down. it is fantastic. the sound effects keep me laughing. the graphics are great. simple to play but also challenging.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|This product is awfull. It jams every time you pull the trigger and I need to return it. My son was very disapointed on how bad it worked.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Its hard to put it down.  Makes you want to keep playing. I like that there are a few choices in the menu as to type of game to play.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After watching all six Blu-rays of this amazing series of films, I find that this a great gift for any casual Star Wars fan. I would however take a little caution if you are a someone who prefers the unaltered versions of the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6) and that's ok too since we all have opinions on Lucas's alterations. This set does have the altered scenes like Greedo shoots first instead of Han, Hayden Christensen's ghost appears at the end of episode 6, The emperor's appearance is different to look how he appeared in episode 3,and the sarlacc pit's mouth is different and etc. But if you are not a purist and just looking to sit back and enjoy a day off or a weekend watching these classics, then you'll find this box set a perfect way just to do that.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|So many games to choose from in this deluxe version.  Its addicting fun. You can always go back and redo a game if you would like to beat your previous score.
0981951252|4.0|nice audio to listen in the car since I have little time to sit down and ready a book. Great
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Cute movie for the family to watch and enjoy together. Maybe the kids can even learn something for nanny McPhee!
0981951244|4.0|Great book which was very interesting to read. I would recommned this book to anyone who is serious about changing their lives.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Really good and enjoyable to watch. Can't wait until season 2 is out! All my friends love it, too. .
B005IQZB14|5.0|What an awesome story! I've read a lot of thru-hiking memoirs, some good and some very bad...this one falls into the upper spectrum for sure. Not only a story of a hike, but a woman's quest to fix her life and resolve her pain...very well written and I couldn't stop reading it!! Definitely a must-read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone that wants an amazing book to read. I could not put this book down.
B00536OCZA|5.0|Came as expected, I believe earlier than anticipated too :) the product itself was great 180 g heavyweight vinyl. Great quality, sounds great. Also came with a card/pword to download these songs on iTunes as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was by far my favorite Batman movie with Christian Bale.  I thought the story was great, the action was intense.  Overall, one of my favorite movies of all time.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Although this book was about something so awful and devastating I was unable to put it down because it was so good. This is the second story that I've read from Jodi Picoult. I really enjoy the style Jodi Picoult writes her stories, from then to now, and getting all character's perspectives. This was the second book I've read from this author and I can't wait to read another!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|my daughter like it so do I, I got it in the free deal promotion, dont know if it would get a different ratting if I had to pay for it, fair is fair .
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|I found this book to be inspiring and informative. There were a few places where the author seemed to contradict himself, but who cares, the information was outstanding.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Such a masterpiece! Can't wait for the next one, which I'm quite sure will be even more intriguing!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I've watched most of the second season, and it lived up to all of my expectations. Great show. I look forward to 3.
0345803485|5.0|Got the book when they said it would be there.  I don't know how the book reads, but my wife sure liked it LOL
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents with me in mind.  Only watched The Dark Knight Rises, but I'm sure the other 2 will look just as great and sound awesome (Bose speakers = awesome sound!).
B009YU62H2|5.0|It was worth the wait for sure. From Been Away too Long and beyond, this album kicks hard, melodic and cool...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|INCREDIBLE!!!  5 STARS just isn't enough!!!<br />Hopeless was by far one of most amazing book I've read.  I can't say that it was the easiest read, because it tears your heart out, but it was so worth it. The characters are so well written it feels as if you know who they truly are. Dean is such an extraordinary person, which you realize first... But then you discover the insurmountable obstacles and the depth of all the characters and, I myself am in awe that Colleen Hoover was able to create this reality. Please read Hopeless, you won't regret it.
B00A12VW86|5.0|Of the three releases this is my favorite. They're all good. But I think this one has the most cool songs.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|i really loved the movie it was sad in some parts but funny as hell in the rest and made me cry at the end andthis is a great movie to rent or buy for the whole family
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works just like it says it should. I am very pleased with it and I really like all the little features that let you know approximately how much time I can use different features with the battery life left. It even lets you know how long it has been since the last charge.
B0063IH60K|3.0|An ad pops up every time you deal a hand; that gets old quick.  Otherwise the graphics are great and gameplay is very fluid.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just loved this so much, I mean wow. To really know how it went down is kind of a relief. Seal team six will forever be Americas heroes. I'm glad I found this book and I thank all who were involved. A great read. Must have.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|This was for the granddaughter. She ask for it ,and loves it on HER mp3 player. If you like Taylor Swift, you should check it out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like the challenge of each screen building upon what I learned in the previous screen. The screen had good clarity.
0385528752|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to my dad and he seemed to think it was very insightful. Great book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fantastic!!! Wonderful writing, so real is amazing. You find your self feeling everything that sky feels a  well as every character that means something to her. I would  recommend to everyone. Thank you for such an incredible book.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a Christmas gift.  We have not watched it yet.  Usually, we listen to CDs of the music we like.  This is going to be a treat to see recorded live.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is so intriguing and hot. I cannot wait to start ending the second book. If you liked the 50 shades series you'll love this one. Better get to the second  in  now :)
B00846REIS|4.0|I LOVED Fifty Shades, and in needing another twisted love story to sink into and this was just right. To me it seems more tame then FS on the sex scenes which is a nice change. I would recommend it definitely! Can't wait  to continue the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good read. Finished it quickly. Love the story and the characters. Enjoyed the movie and can't wait for the next two.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Actually I've not seen the movie. Our granddaughter said it was one of the best movies she had ever seen.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun. I can't wait to play it whenever I get home from school.<br />This game is fun
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The telling tale about whether or not a movie is good is if it is still loved and enjoyed fifty years later! The sound of music will always pass that test.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game,interesting story line. Good graphics and easy to follow. Interesting sets. Keeps you guessing. recommend this for mystery seekers.
B006O3MU96|3.0|Not a big phone gamer.  Fills that spare time.  Guess for a game there is not a lot of action but fun never the less.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Pretty sweet game. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sharp and easy game to play or just kill some time....
1451620829|5.0|I've read a few rock biographies including Ace and Genes and this surpasses them all.  This cool cat just tells it how it is, no holds barred, down to every sordid detail without giving a shit what anyone thinks. To share so candidly and intimately like this with the fans is truly admirable.  Will Paul have the last word though?
B00280LYIM|5.0|I am 12 years old and really enjoying this series. Plus I love having a kindle to read them on.
B00785P2QC|3.0|game is awesome. you should download. would like to have energy available to purchase by coins. also could make the land expansions easier without so many mountain's and hills. I really enjoy it otherwise
B009O2XY12|1.0|requires 'points' to play and if you run low there is a time out involved. You can 'pay' to continue playing.  All of that is just too much when all you want is a bit of distraction.  Like Bubble Shooter much better.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was so freaking funny! I think I'm going to have to buy it! ..........  Up there w bridesmaids
B008CPZNL6|3.0|This app is really good on the iPhone. The too-small font problems have been corrected. However, I do not like the new navigation. I want to flip up and down to go through the pages of an article, and then to the left or right to change articles, just like on the iPhone version. The new version forces me to use the back button to go back and flips through articles left to right. The other issue I have with this app (all versions) is that there are way too many articles which have only the beginning of the article, followed by \\"Continue Reading\\", forcing you to open the original article in a browser. The whole point of Flipboard (at least to me) is to get the content in a nicely formatted way without having to open a browser. I am very disappointed and will continue to sideload an old version. It still has the \\"Continue Reading\\" problem, but at least I can read what is there and the navigation is better.
B009MO5E10|5.0|When I saw the trailors to this movie I was interested.  After watching the entire movie, I thought it was really well put together with a little twist.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My son was resistant to watching it at first, but now he requests it as much as his sister - they love it. Very stunning visual presentation. Disc wouldn't play on my cheapo player without freezing up right at the beginning every time, so I can only play it on my regular, name-brand player.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The Mentalist is one of those series you like to watch.  Simon Baker is great as  Jane, Lisbon, Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt are the other regulars who are also really good.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|So much variation in style from track to track, but they're all enjoyable in their own way. Bruno Mars is a terrific artist. Very grown up but entertaining album.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Whitney Houston always gave everything she possibly could in good times and in bad times  she will be missed; but, never forgotten for all she gave to all her fans.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I was riveted to the story, coincidentally beginning the book the day before the Newtown tragedy.  The author carefully researched what is known about children who kill children and presented a complex, completely believable portrait of such monsters and the family dynamics that lead them to their unbelievable acts.  Is it nature or nurture?  Shriver makes a strong case for both.  I approached this book with some trepidation, having been so disappointed in &#34;Gone Girl&#34; with its unbelievable, false-sounding interpersonal dynamic, but everything in Shriver's book rings true.  Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait to read the next one page Turner!  I read it so quick because I had to know what was next!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the first half of the book was great. Every chapter seemed to bring a new twist, and then the 2nd half started, and while it was still good, it wasn't quite as interesting to me as the first half. That's not to say it isn't a good book, though. It's just that, for me, the first half is a 5 and the 2nd half is a 4. The characters are very interesting, and over time you definitely see their dark sides...
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|you have to buy coins or wait awhile to get kore after u use the free ones they give u
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Prometheus is a mixed-up, messed up prequel to the Alien series, and you would do best just to avoid seeing this at all.  I loved the Alien series and am a huge sci-fi fan, but this film is a jumble of different ideas and stories forced together into one big pile.  Granted, some of the CGI effects are great, but in the end you will see that there were so many plot holes in the story it dissolved and floated away.  I certainly hope there is no sequel to this. Oh, and the acting is terrible, too.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book. Each character is interesting and the settings change frequently. The message of the book is imbedded in the conversations between the characters.
B0053O89U6|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW! Blu ray is so nice! It remembers where you left off, even if you take it out of the player. Got a GREAT price on Amazon!
0307352145|5.0|Eye-opener. Astounding. Life-changing. Inspirational. Insightful. All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.<br /><br />I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.<br /><br />Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more \\"out there\\" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?<br /><br />And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the \\"New Books\\" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.<br /><br />\\"Figure myself out\\" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.<br /><br />I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my \\"problem\\". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.<br /><br />I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my \\"work problems\\". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.<br /><br />If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read this book three times and each time is better than the last! I strongly recommend this book for teens and adults.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I purchased this app for my daughter.  She is 7, and she loves it.  It is easy to use, and fun.  You have many choices as a hair stylist or barber.  I recommend it highly.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved being able to watch without commercial interuption.  Worth every cent I paid for this gift to myself. Loved it.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Anybody who tries to keep up wih the news for the last 50 years or so, think they know what's going on with national and world events.  This book will explode many of your beliefs in politics for the last 60 years.  Americans want to believe we are always the good guys.  This book is about how that isn't always so.  Prompted by nationalist feeling, the US has interfered with governments across the globe, with money and military intervention, for their own ends.<br />You will never be able to read or watch the news the same again after reading this book. You will question what is really going on, as you should.
B004GGQMRY|5.0|Rain Man is my favorite film ever. its touching, sweet, and mesmerizing. Dustin Hoffman gives the best performance of his career. he makes you love Raymond just like his brother does. which takes you on a journey that make the connection between movie and mind even more powerful. Also the sound makes this breathtaking score even greater. there are some hard parts but those parts are needed to make the story better and more real. I recommend this movie to just about everyone I talk to. everyone in the world needs to see this movie, not just because its good entertainment, but because of the message and ideas in the story.
B007D5E7C2|3.0|This was for my little brother. I have seen both before, and I think watching it a few times is alright. I like strong female characters in movies/books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let's face it. There are a lot of crappy books out there, especially of late. The advent of e-books, which while excellent in the ability to get new authors exposure in numbers previously only achieved by \\"super authors\\", unfortunately opens the market to a flood of bad and mediocre writers the same way American Idol has revealed to us a plethora of people who just thought they could sing. Not that I am any kind of expert. But from an avid reader's standpoint, one who gets to read much more seldom than she would like, this is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The storytelling is quick and efficient but in a good way. It adds an element of truth to the story. The characters are well developed but not overly so. It moves you along in a \\"I can't stop this ride but I really don't want to\\" kind of way. I truly cannot wait to start the next book to see where the story goes from here!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I have all of Michael's concerts & interviews. He is awesome to watch & I never get tired of him. Fred Astaire was a huge fan. Michael's body of work will live forever.
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|I have owned (including this model) three Lego space shuttles, and this is by far the best. The connections of the tank to the shuttle and boosters to the tank are very real. The fuel tank alone is over a foot tall and around 3\\" in diameter. The shuttle has retractable landing gear, but the rear wheels have no easy way to lower like the front. My big gripe is with the packaging. One, the box is about twice as tall as it needed to be, given that all that was inside was close to half a dozen bags. I would have expected for a set of this size, it should have been either a large tray with different sections or at least the bags set to each section. One for the tank, one for the boosters, one or two for the shuttle and one for the base. So simple, yet Lego messed it up.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this for my 7 year old son since he loves dogs, but I think our whole family liked looking through here.  Tons of great pictures!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Great film. Heartwarming, sweet, inspiring and great performances from the UK's best. Completely recommend. Makes me want to go to India.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Now I know what all the fuss is about.  A must read!  Can't wait to start the next book.  Took my breath away.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Enjoyed the show! I've enjoyed so many of the British shows throughout the years- comedies, dramas and soaps! Keep them coming!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Well written book with an improbable story line, which draws you in regardless. I particularly like the mental twist the ending proposes.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I downloaded this game when it was free and it really is a cute game.  It took me a while to figure out how to use the dynamite correctly, but once I did, the game was fun.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I had a great time playing this game. The graphics were fantastic and the puzzles were a good challenge. I can't wait for another game.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|this has to be one of my favorite all time movies ever!!!  A must see if you want to laugh.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|My new favorite time killer! Really well thought out excellent idea. If the hints were a bit more helpful I would have given 5 stars. The game is an excellent time killer and the difficulty level is high enough that I haven't figured everything out yet. Great game.
B000JML90Y|5.0|This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for.
1451695195|5.0|Some sections were somewhat technical but overall it was written to be easily understood outside of medical community.<br />The fact that it was written by the actual  person's experience was enlightening.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Love it! It's an intense Bejeweled!<br />You'll enjoy gaming! There are different patterns to work through, but it will keep you playing. It has a timer that cuts your game if you don' t get rid of it with two other matching shapes.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I selected 5 stars because the price I paid was substainally lower than I found in stores & the shipped item arrived earlier than expected.  Thanks so much
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its what you would expect from virtual city. I would of rather have payed money for it rather than paying for stuff in game.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is so amusing and cute. It even beats out cut the rope and where's my water which are both games I love.
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|Watched on my kindle fire HD & really enjoyed it. Picture & sound were fantastic. Picture was very sharp and I felt like I was watching it in my living room.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Game is ok but has glitches. Needs more ways to earn diamonds and energy and such. Also, need more rooms, so you don't have to do the same ones all the time. I don't understand the point of banishing the trolls when they come back in bigger #s every time. Game is enjoyable but needs less repetition.
B008R14YBK|5.0|My little tween wanted this CD for Christmas; therefore, I had to research.  She was so exited to receive it and loves it
B005COO1X6|5.0|I gave this story five stars because, as always Stephen King brings real life and the \\"possible\\" together in a way that will leave you looking at mundane things in extraordinary ways for the rest of your life! A great read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought this book was great I absolutely loved it. I thought it was beautiful I cried when she left and it made me cry where she did I love you
B009VB7P6G|5.0|A fun movie for all tinkerbell lovers! I recommend it to all ages if you believe in fairy tales. I love the franchise!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think this is A must read book for all woman. I also think men could benefit from reading this. Can't wait for the movie
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book, but having read all of Grisham's books, it was not my favorite. Looking forward to what he writes next.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|AWESOME Story again by Sparks, a little bit of everything for everyone. I can tell he will be a favored author by me.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Oliver Stone described this movie as a \\"counter-myth\\" to the Warren Commission Report. That was an artful way of admitting that his film is a work of fiction.<br /><br />For example, he portrays Garrison's version of the point in the Clay Shaw trial where New Orleans Police officer Aloysius Habighorst is to be called as a witness who will testify that Shaw, while being booked, admitted to using the alias Clay Bertrand: \\"But before Habighorst could take the stand, Judge Haggerty suddenly ordered the jury removed from the court.\\" Like everything else in the movie, the dramatic effectiveness is terrific.<br /><br />However, it's simply not true. It was Garrison's own second chair, Assistant DA James Alcock, who asked for the jury to be removed: \\"Your Honor, before calling the State's next witness, I might announce to the Court that the matter we are now going into, by law is required to be gone into outside the presence of the Jury, so at this time I would ask the Court to excuse the Jury so that we might enter this area in accordance with the law.\\" There's no controversy about this. The trial transcript is public record and available online.<br /><br />Dramatic license, you might say. Like the composite characters. Or the fact that Garrison did not meet Fletcher Prouty - the \\"X\\" so brilliantly portrayed by Donald Sutherland - until long after the Shaw trial.<br /><br />But the film's insinuations come in such a rapid-fire onslaught that they overwhelm one's critical faculties. X says, \\"We had a third of a combat division returning from Germany in the air above the United States at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 PM, the entire telephone system went dead in Washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to Washington, word was radioed from the White House Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson that one individual performed the assassination.\\"<br /><br />In fact, the phone outages were uneven and occurred in several major cities - as one would expect in the wake ofsuch a cataclysmic news story. [Search for \\"sinister phone outage\\" for details.] I'm sure many of you tried and failed to telephone people in New York City on 9/11. And I don't believe even 9/11 truthers attribute that to a government conspiracy. However, the \\"JFK\\" viewer has no time to process any of this.<br /><br />Now I am not condemning the movie for this. On the contrary, it's what makes it such a riveting viewing experience. [The few dull scenes - most of which are the boilerplate domestic stuff with Sissy Spacek - come almost as a relief from the surrounding three hours of tension and paranoia.] But the result is as propagandistic as anything put forward by Warren Commission defenders like Gerald Posner or Vincent Bugliosi.<br /><br />I don't believe Kennedy was the peacenik Stone hero-worships him as. So I don't believe his central theory that Kennedy was killed as a threat to the military-industrial establishment. I also don't believe that a commission comprised of the ilk of Gerald Ford and Arlen Specter deserves the least benefit of the doubt. So the questions remain - and probably always will. Just don't let the dazzling film artistry of Oliver Stone fool you into thinking he has the answers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very enlightening of how some human minds work, but an enjoyable read. I would recommend it to my friends. and have done so..
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is addictive. I'm not sure if that's a good thing, but it's a great version of an old standard, simple and fun to use.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am a prolific reader, but was not anxious to read about children killing others, however, several friends felt it wouldn't be as gory as one might expect. I thought the book had much insight as to what can happen to a society with the \\"Capitol\\"; and history repeating itself. It is not difficult, at many levels, to relate the ancient Roman Games held in the Collusium to the current Hunger Games. The heroine Katniss is wise beyond her years and each character is quite memorable. Read all three books for the full background of the storyline.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I am usually really bad at bubble games but I took a chance on this one. I really enjoy it and end up playing longer than I probably should. I prefer the plain black background over the wood look. I enjoy both the regular mode and arcade mode, but I find I rarely play the arcade mode.<br /><br />I would have rated this five stars, but I deducted one star because:<br />- There is no way to disable the vibration, which gets really annoying, especially when it makes it impossible to play in quiet environments.<br />- There is no way to save/pause a game in arcade mode as you can in the regular mode. This is annoying when you have a good game going and need to access another app or the phone rings.<br /><br />The glitch I've found rare random floating balls, that do eventually fall. I've uploaded screen shots.<br /><br />So far, the highest level I've got to on the regular game mode [not arcade mode] is 177. You really have to get as many of the \\"20 extra balls\\" balls to fall, as after level 80 you do not get the extra 5 balls for finishing a level. I avoid the \\"color bomb\\" balls [not the regular bomb balls] as much as possible.<br /><br />Also, this shows as version 1.09 and my phone has version 1.08, but won't let me update.<br /><br />Dear Deemedya M.S. Ltd - PLEASE update this app to let us turn off the vibration feature! Thanks.<br /><br />It would also be nice to be able to contact Deemedya, via the app or email, like you can with other apps/developers.<br /><br />I also agree with other reviewers that the Global High Scores are ridiculously too high.

B005SZAEYO|5.0|Thanks to having Amazon Prime, I am the newest addict for this amazing show.<br />Watch the first episode and (fair warning) you will be too.<br /><br />Jessica Lange was always a favorite of mine but she absolutely mesmerizes in this, in spite of being a lady \\"of a certain age\\".  I cannot believe how time has not only not hurt her, but has even added immensely to her looks and acting talent, which was always fantastic anyway.  Her acting here is hypnotic and has won her yet another Emmy to add to her collection, this time for best performance in a television series, and I must say this, it is most definitely well deserved. I cannot believe the quality of her acting here, it must be seen to be appreciated.  Her role here started as a very small one, but when her brilliance was seen, she was given much more script, to become a lead character.<br /><br />A cast of eccentrics, all of whom have a connection to a lovely but extremely haunted old Victorian mansion, all become tightly wedged into the intrigue and drama (and outright horror)  that pervades every second.<br /><br />The intro to each episode, and the soundtrack, have to be the absolute best that has ever adorned the television screen.  This is a brand of creepiness that I've never encountered anywhere.  How can old photographs of babys and toddlers inspire such a blend of horror? Maybe it's the large lab jars of tiny heads, hands and legs that are flashed on the screen, and the strange horror on the children's faces.  I wish I had twenty minutes of that intro soundtrack.  It's just delicious and creepy, totally brilliant.<br /><br />Who or rather what is living up there in the attic all these years?  And is that school shooter a ghost, or a warm blooded very alive boyfriend for the oddly appealing adolescent girl, who is a \\"cutter\\"?<br /><br />What exactly is the mother pregnant with this time?  Who or what impregnated her, dressed in that latex head to toe costume?<br /><br />And on and on the bizarre plot twists go, each one seemingly more strange than the next.  The storyline is fantastic, the acting is all over the top brilliant, and the settings are very much a part of the action.<br /><br />I can't praise this highly enough, nor can I ever get my fill of it.  This story of American Horror is spine tingling, albeit gruesome, fun every single second.wists go, each one seemingly more strange than the next.

B00AEFVRB2|2.0|I am Matthew McConaughey's biggest fan and I was truly dissapointed with this movie.  The story was horrible, the acting was poor.  Overall the movie was boring!
B0080R7Q70|5.0|The Flower Kings took a 5 year hiatus while members worked on various side projects over the past few years.  So, it was with great anticipation when fans heard the news that a new album would be forthcoming in 2012.  After the long wait would they be disappointed?  Well, I guess that depends on your perspective.  What the Flower Kings have delivered in \\"Banks Of Eden\\" is exactly what their long time fans have come to expect.  Well written, melodic progressive rock in the classic sense of the genre.  Fans looking for something new or experimental will not find it here.  The Flower Kings stick to their classic formula and deliver a solid album of what the band has always excelled at.  The album begins with the 25 minute long epic \\"Numbers\\" and then segues into 4 shorter (by prog standards) songs to finish out the album.  All of the tracks are solid and well written.  New drummer Felix Lehrmann fits right in, and Roine, Hasse, Tomas and Jonas all fill their roles admirably.  I find it a bit ironic that some fans are complaining about the lack of experimentation on this album.  In the past, when the band have tried to branch out their sound into jazz, fusion, rio or metal it has always seemed to back fire on them, with listeners turning their heads and not embracing what the band was trying to pull off.  On \\"Banks\\" the band play it totally straight forward and are criticized for not being experimental enough.  Sometimes with prog fans, you just can't win.  Anyway, limiting this album to a single disc clocking in at under an hour was a smart move and avoids some of the bloat that could be found on some of the band's previous double releases.  In the end I think this is a great Flower Kings album and the time off seems to have revitalized these guys in a lot of positive ways.  If you love the Flower Kings you should enjoy this one.
0393316041|5.0|I ordered two of these and they arrived quickly in great condition.  This book was fun to read and it had many truths that I appreciated.
B007WPM4P0|5.0|I truly appreciate Eddie Redmayne and can't wait to see where his career goes.  Although some of Stephen Wraysford's story defies the laws of reason, Birdsong is everything you want in a period love story produced by the BBC and based on a Sebastian Faulks novel.  Heart wrenching, melodramatic, and impossible...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Incredible finish. Last chapter wasn't too satisfying but it still was an incredible turn around from the first book. Truly engaging. I really really hope that the movie won't ruin the depth of this story.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Was this movie supposed to be entertaining?  It was not! However, if you like half naked vapid pretty boys, then by all means...see this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wouldn't have guessed that they would go back. Another hypnotic tale. The movie better not ruin this! Really enjoyed it.
B00APUTEBG|2.0|Watching &#34;The Cold Light of Day,&#34; is like standing in the The Cold Light of Day with no coat or boots. Clearly the primary cast must have needed milk or travel money. Why else would they agree to be in this movie.  I also find it extremely funny that the folks in Henry Cavill's camp had the presence of mind to burry this film, but didn't know to tell him NOT to do it even while he was negotiating for the role of Superman.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|A bit more bad language than I expected when viewing with teens. Did also skip over two explicit scenes.<br />Plot line was  a bit confusing, but it all came together at the end.
B0026P3G12|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for a close friend.  She listened to it here with me first and we both really liked it.  I decided to get her first CD as that was the one we had heard and m friend really liked it.  It was a good choice as a gift.<br /><br />Amazon and the Marketplace are where I look first to buy gifts as I can always count on them not to disappoint me and for the best prices.  Any problems are quickly resolved to my satisfaction.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|As usual his stories flow very well. Characters are easy to follow unlike some books I have read with to many undefined characters.
1426308469|5.0|Our four year old grandson loved it.  His eight year old brother enjoyed it too.  It is informative and educational while being entertaining.  Perfect for young minds.
B0083Z614S|2.0|Reading the book with the Yorkshire language got annoying after a while. It just didn't keep my interest until I was almost to the end.
0375851569|5.0|I sent this as a Christmas gift to my little nephew (he is two).  He was very happy.  The pictures are clear and sharp and have just the right detail to interest him.  The rhymes are classics!
B0031ES8P6|3.0|Cute but I wouldn't purchase again. Its so small and the dress was faded on my beanie. It was cute though

B00APUQRPC|5.0|Eastwood's grumpy demeanor was typical of his roles lately, but he adds his personal touches to bring the character to life. The sports movie, that's really not about sports at all, explores the strained relationship between an aging baseball scout (Eastwood) and his successful, workaholic daughter (Adams). When JT is added to this combination - I'm sold completely!  Loved the movie and would recommend to anyone.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|I was hoping it would be as good as the first, but I was disappointed. It was a let down from the first one. Only three stars for me.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas and she said she's already been moved to tears a couple of times.  This book evokes so much emotion and empathy.  With bullying becoming more and more prevalent and the anonymity of social networking and online chat rooms it's too easy for our kids (and sometimes us adults too) to forget that we are all filled with the same emotions - we all hurt and we all cry, we all laugh and we all have hopes and dreams.  This book is a really good reminder of the old saying, &#34;You can't judge a book by its cover&#34;.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I love this movie! The special effects are crazy and the storyline was interesting also. I highly recommend this movie.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|The first time I played this with a group of 5 I thought, what the heck did I buy this for? It was really a bad game. After we played we ate some food and couldn't stop talking about it. We played it all wrong.<br />The issue we had was we were trying to play at a competitive level. This isn't that type of game.<br />This game is to create conversation and tell stories.<br /><br />I play with my 5 year old, and it really helps him get creative (Yes I know, the game is for 8 and up- but I assure you it is still fun). This game is about getting creative and using your imagination, once you learn that the game becomes pretty fun.<br /><br />This game art is awesome, and the rules are simple enough that you can include children (for entertainment purposes at least).<br />Playing this with my son is great, he can take a card and give it a back story. That is the point of this game.<br />When my 5 year old started to play he would describe the card exactly, such as \\"Two Knights fighting on a chess board floor\\"...there are not a lot of cards that depict that. Now he might take that same card and say \\"This is necessary for the kingdoms!\\" It opens up a lot more possibilities.<br /><br />A house rule I have to play with an adult and child:<br />Shuffle the cards and flip the top one and tell a story. Flip the next card and continue the story, and keep going. The game isn't meant to be played like that, but it is still fun.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 - Rules are easy to following<br />2 - Game play is typically around 30 minutes<br />3 - Art work is pretty sweet<br />4 - Builds creativity<br />5 - The more you play the more you will enjoy it and the better you will be at it<br />6 - Easy to teach<br />7 - The cards are over sized so it makes your hands feel small, I recommend wearing an oversized hat as well while playing<br />8 - No reading involved so children and older people that have problems reading cards can play<br />9 - I have yet to see any arguing from the players takeplace in this game (even if my dad really hard to spin us up)<br />10 - The game is not very competitive<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 - First time playing I found to be pointless, I didn't understand the concept of a \\"story telling\\" game<br />2 - This game is not very fun with fewer than 4 people; it says can play with 3 but that becomes lame very quick<br />3 - The more expansions added, the better the game is, this is a con because they are not cheap and I am not rich<br />4 - The point system is difficult to keep track of if you have 5-6 players (Dixit Odyssey fixed this with the new \\"voting\\" system)<br />5 - The game is not very competitive<br />6- If you play it with your dad he may act like an idiot in attempts to frustrate other players
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Very close to performance on the PC once you get it customized.  Much better than playing with the controller.  Used it for BF3, COD, etc.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I loved the Peter Griffen voice for Ted. It was a cool movie and wake up for dudes that have best friends who wreck relationships.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|But free! This is a fun game. Not addictive fun, just enjoyable and free. I recommend it for anyone. I wouldn't buy the coins, though.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is my new alter ego. I was 26 when my mom died.  I was a &#34;serious&#34; adult.....husband, 2 kids, mortgage.  I just stayed numb and thought that that was the way it was.  I did not take a risk and explore life until I was in my forties.  I am now in my late sixties and partially disabled by a stroke and yet, through Strayed's story telling skills, I was able to join her on her trek. I love her energy and her efficiency in moving the action along.  By writing her story several years after her trek, she had a philosophical perspective that elevated the book beyond a mere factual recitation of her life.  Unless, of course, she made it all up. In that case, she is a superb writer of fiction.  I thank her and this is my pick for my book club.
B005KLN056|5.0|The concert is excellet!!! The songs are the best since some great hits like Night Train for all whom enjoy hard rock. I would buy it again for sure!! It does not contain songs from last Slash album Apocaliptic love, only previous albums but Im sure you wont regret buying it.

B00338QENI|5.0|How to make fascinating a scientific subject?  Such a difficult task Ms. Skloot set out to describe - the importance of the cells of Henrietta Lacks to humankind and the life she led as well as the generational inheritance her illness contributed to the world.  The author skillfully switched stories throughout the book so that the reader never lost place, never lost character and even more astoundingly, the scientific story was skillfully told in plain language.<br /><br />I found this book so intriguing that I bought copies of it as gifts for friends and family who I knew would appreciate both its complexity and its story.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, and quite addicting. It's fun just to play, but they also give challenges for you to complete. You won't want to play it forever but it's definitely worth a look.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is my first review for any app, which indicates how much I enjoy this game. Works really well with the S Pen on Galaxy Note 2.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|If you need to know about the moon phases this is your app. It gives notifications about phase changes and sets it by your location.
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|If  you shut your brain off, this movie is a hell of a lot of fun. There are a lot of nods to Resident Evil 4 and 5 found within this flick. Being a huge resident evil 4 fan I found myself quite enjoying this film. The plot is in many ways your basic video game plot (Get from Point A to Point B, killing everything in your way. Throw in a couple of plot twists, stages, bosses, returning villains, absurd costumes etc etc). Its a ridiculous premise but who cares?<br /><br />Why are there several versions of cities in an underwater Russian facility? Why not!!<br />Characters we thought dead returned to life? Excellent! Bring on evil Michelle Rodriguez.<br />Why is that woman wearing a red dress in the middle of a frozen wasteland? Because its Ada Wong, the B*T#@ in the red dress.<br /><br />Seriously, turn your brain off and enjoy the action. Its a good time for all. After the first couple of Resident Evil films I realized that Mr. Anderson would be diverging from the games, throwing in characters from the games in an attempt to satisfy the existing resident evil fan base. I enjoy the films regardless. They're dumb, fun action.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was an interesting and well written story.  Shows a glimpse of how a young person would feel if they were placed in a situation of kill or be killed.  No matter how you make the world in a fictional setting, there is always an emotional toll if you are any kind of human.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Very interesting and informative talks. Just long enough and chocked full of ideas and facts. I also like that you can pick and chose from over 1,000 talks so there is bound to be something for everyone to learn.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  Since there's been so much hype, he was skeptical that he'd enjoy it.  But, we're hooked!  Great cast and interesting storyline.
B0041O40EI|5.0|We went to London for our 10th anniversary in the spring, so this puzzle was a big hit with the wife. We stayed and &#34;played&#34; in the part of the city the puzzle depicts. Very cool to see how it changed over the century's. A fun family project!
B0000C3I6U|3.0|Has not shipped yet but Its for my husband who Ill guess will like it since he watches it on internet all the time.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|It is hard to describe, I loved the book but feel somewhat confused. Like I haven't put all the  pieces together quite yet. Likely I will need to let it sink in overnight. The characters where fascinating, the first person narration was a driving force, I really enjoyed it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun movie. The singing was great. It made me laugh. I consider it &#34;worthy of owning&#34; because I would watch it again.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Mr. Straight's journey of a couple of hundred miles on a riding lawn mower appeales to my sense of independence.  Movie was well done, except maybe 2 parts, long shots, where the microphone could've been better placed to pick up the dialogue.  I saw this on cable 5 or so years ago, & have always been looking for it.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|This is a long draw out tale with a lot of interesting info in it.  Sorry to see Harry go the way of the Pterodactyl...
B00A5052YE|1.0|I guess this is what I get for buying something that is supposed to be &#34;top of the charts&#34;. The album is uninspired, and is extremely boring after about 3 minutes.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|How did this get rated PG-13?  The sexual content was through the roof.<br /><br />I thought Hope Springs looked like a cute, funny movie about a husband and wife falling in love again.  And maybe it was - but I sure didn't get that far.  I think my husband and I made it about 25 minutes into the movie before turning it off.  I don't really care to watch random people \\"exploring themselves\\" or learning how to give their husbands oral sex.<br /><br />One thing is for sure - Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep do a great job at acting uncomfortable.  Although they probably didn't HAVE to act during those scenes.  Yikes.<br /><br />Glad I rented instead of buying it, but still sad about being out $4.  I could have used that to watch a clean, decent movie.  Bummer.

I have yet to put it to work, but if the 1,000's of YouTubers who own this swear by it...I will too. I trust Ka-Bar and Becker. A MUST HAVE! came very sharp(was able to shave hair off my arm & cut through paper like butter). One thing is this....The sheath ,while great, is a pain at first. The retention is so good you have to use 2 hands to remove the BK2.lol. Either some how file the inside of it a bit or wait and in time it will break in. Search for a Hedgehog Leather works leather sheath for this model....they are expensive($150-$200), but very well worth it. For now i will stick with the sheath it came with and just oil the blade, as one should with carbon steel. Hope this helps.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I actually listened to the audio book from audible.com and it was unbelievable.  There are many twists in this book that keep you guessing until the end.  Even at the end you are guessing.<br /><br />The book is about a boy who was supposed to have killed another boy at his school.  It is about the trial and what had happened during and after.  This story is about how this impacts his family--his father was a assistant DA.<br /><br />The books keeps you very interested on the out come of the story.  I am very glad I purchased this audio book.  I had been looking at the Kindle book for awhile. It doesn't make a difference whether you read the book or listen to the audio book, yoe will be surprised on how this book ends.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|First, it should be said that Dom-Sub sexuality, sadism, painfully rough sex and psychological voyeurism in print are NOT for everyone.  This is not a book for minors or the easily impressionable who lack other experience or insights.  PD James wrote for maximum adult X-rated pornographic effect --  and that's what this series largely accomplishes, regardless of the window dressing of the author's psycho-babble and romantic heavy breathing.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out various loose ends in the plot, with which I agree.  Unexplained is the exceptional freedom of the male protagonist, billionaire Christian Grey, with regard to using his own time. That facet of the story is simply unreal in the world of the very rich.  The super-rich work hard, even if some of them also party hearty.  Likewise, one would have to believe that Christian is some kind of extra-terrestrial, to accept with sincere belief, his ever-surging testosterone and virility.  Also unexplained is the remarkable blindness of the female narrator Anastasia to her own attractiveness and competence.  The notion of an inexperienced virgin having an orgasm during her first sexual encounter is really pretty far out there.  There also seem to be numerous odd missing pieces of her character. She comes across as a sketch at times, rather than as a person.<br /><br />These things being said, Fifty Shades and its sequels are still an engaging tale for many reasons.  Not least is the fascination of millions of readers with the stories, despite the roundly condemning (and in my personal view often silly) tirades of so-called \\"mainstream\\" critics, Evangelicals and other moralists.  Trying not to over-think the whole thing, I surmise that we read the stories with guilty fascination in part because so many of us are still deeply sexually repressed by the prevailing cultures of both East and West.  Not withstanding 60 years of sexual and feminist liberation movements in the West -- and the huge volume of sexually explicit imagery on our public networks -- we still live lives of \\"quiet desperation\\" in most matters sexual.  We feel inadequate, deprived --  or alternately manipulated and abused. There are many moral and social axes in these conditions.  Perhaps above all else, we are ambivalent -- yearning for something better and exciting in the sexual dimension of daily life, which prevailing cultural morality denies us and labels as dirty or evil.<br /><br />While Fifty Shades of Grey and its sequels can fairly be called extreme or even unreal, the stories do us a profound service. In a meaningful way, our fascination with them confirms the yawning gap between our publicly affirmed moral standards and our personal human needs.  To bridge that gap, I sense that we will be required to question past \\"standards\\" of moral behavior and human relationship expectations.  We do not yet see clearly, what the humanly healthy answers to such questions may become.  But our moral world is no longer black and white, religious good or apostate evil, righteous or vile.  Our moral world is fifty shades of grey.  And it is time to begin dealing with that reality.<br /><br />Thank you EL James --  even if you intended titillation and fun, rather than deep moral purpose.sexually explicit imagery on our public networks -- we still live lives of \\"quiet desperation\\" in most matters sexual.  We feel inadequate, deprived --  or alternately manipulated and abused. There are many moral and social axes in these conditions.  Perhaps above all else, we are ambivalent -- yearning for something better and exciting in the sexual dimension of daily life, which prevailing cultural morality denies us and labels as dirty or evil.<br /><br />While Fifty Shades of Grey and its sequels can fairly be called extreme or even unreal, the stories do us a profound service. In a meaningful way, our fascination with them confirms the yawning gap between our publicly affirmed moral standards and our personal human needs.  To bridge that gap, I sense that we will be required to question past \\"standards\\" of moral behavior and human relationship expectations.  We do not yet see clearly, what the humanly healthy answers to such questions may become.  But our moral world is no longer black and white, religious good or apostate evil, righteous or vile.  Our moral world is fifty shades of grey.  And it is time to begin dealing with that reality.<br /><br />Thank you EL James --  even if you intended titillation and fun, rather than deep moral purpose.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is an ok read, but not as great as the first two. It was as if the author got bored and just wanted to finish. It's a definite read to find out what happens to the characters, but don't expect more.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I saw this in theaters, on a plane, and in the comfort of my home.  It is witty, fun, and one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  I watched all of the movies leading up to it since I'm a fan, but I don't think that you have to watch them to enjoy this one.  It's good for all ages and just as fun to watch with family or friends as it is to watch alone.^^
0618154248|5.0|Bought this for our 18 month old daughter who LOVES \\"momo\\". She loves these books and even 'reads' them to us. ADORABLE!!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the book series and some of the older Sherlock Holmes TV series and this went above and beyond my expectations (just like the first season which blew my mind XD ).  I would (and do) recommend this to everyone - it is that good.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Gread show, would recommend any adult to watch.  Show isn't kid friendly but they have enough shows to watch. Can't wait for the next episodes.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy and fast to learn. Time flies by so fast , you<br />won't be disappointed. A can be played by all ages
B001NESPHC|5.0|I love this cd.  Love Melody Gardot's voice and songwriting.  Bought this cd to give to a friend for Christmas and she loves it too!  The cd has a jazzy, smokey quality that is just right for sitting around on a cold winter night with a glass of wine.  Romantic and swinging by turns.
1869509269|5.0|it was very helpful to see where the sites are and how there. Some day I hope to go there.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watch this over and over!  Glad to have it in my &#34;library&#34; so I can access via Kindle while on the go.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Easy, quick read.  Typical Stephen King.  Didn't know it was a short story.  First book I have read on my kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|My five year old son played this game on the bus drivers Kindle on the way home from school and loved it!! Begged me to download it to our Kindle.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome I loved it. Wish it would never end ! Probably the best Nicholas sparks books I have ever read !
0307719219|3.0|Dry and long but very factual. Had to read it for an econ book review so if I was more interested in the topic, I might have given it a higher rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BREATHTAKING. I  want  more.<br />  I do believe that the movie does the book no justice. Can't wait to read the next one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|if you like puzzle games that stimulate your brain and increase problem solving abilities, then get this app.  i recently suggested it for my mother who retired last week and she loves it.  best part is, its free.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun. I never put it down. I have no problem with it.<br />I'm glad I found a fun game to play.
034580404X|5.0|Great buy... Especially for a gift . An addictive read. Prefer the 2nd book out of the three. Arrived early and with care!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was an eye opening experience that every teenager, or even adult should read. I would tell anybody to read this book, simply because I know that in some way, they will be touched.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|This item arrived on time and in very good condition. This is one of a very small handful of movies that I would want to own. I would recommend this seller.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series already and bought this 1) to own it myself to be able to watch whenever I'd like and 2) in order to watch again these seasons prior to the 3rd season beginning very soon.  Of course it met my expectations!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my favorite Pride and Prejudice. Others don't compare with these two actors. The visual affects and costumes were exceptional.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|My son introduced me to the Game of Thrones book series, and I enjoyed several of the books prior to watching the videos.  Much to my surprise and delight, the characters on the videos were much like I imagined they would be based on the books.  This is not my usual experience; so CUDOs on that front.<br /><br />Like most books turned television/movie, the television show did not capture all scenes covered in the book; however, if I had not read the books, I would not have known this, so I imagine that viewers of the videos will be impressed with the vividness of the scenes, the lushness and realistic portrayal of the world during that time and the excellent acting.<br /><br />I am glad that I purchased this series.  If you like this genre, you will not be disappointed in its depiction in this Game of Thrones series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super fun for the entire family.  It is a mind challenging game for all ages.  My husband, myself and my 6 year old son have spent several hours on this game.  I love to watch my son figure the puzzles out.  Highly recommended for the entire family.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Simply the best thing on television right now. Layered, complex characters combined with superb writing and directing make Homeland must-see-TV
B000AA4JMU|5.0|As part of the credit due me I would like to order 2 copies of the &#34;Oliver&#34; (DVD + CD) combo and pick something out later with the balance due.  Thanks much!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|In this game you play a virus that much keep mutating with the goal of destroying every human on earth.<br />Original. Interesting. And my favorite game in a long time. Not for kids, but a great adult game.<br />Looking forward to more games by this company.<br />5 stars easy.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|If you like Seth McFarlane type comedy, you'll love this movie.<br />Lots of shock factor humor, not one for the kids.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|Casablanca, a sweeping romance set during WWII, is still a fresh movie today. Unlike many &#34;old movies&#34;, this story transcends its particulars to explore the painful and often wrenching conflict in the human heart between serving oneself and serving the greater good: the quintessential question that defines character. As a tribute to its greatness, this film's relatively simple story has been the object of literally hundreds of derivative plots and references within movie story lines. It is the standard by which cinematic romances, and for that matter, many cinematic dramas, are measured. A movie that should be seen by everyone.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|Gives a good under standing of Buddhist thought as well as telling an engrossing story. A must read by Hesse.
B000002868|3.0|I think that other reviewers here who use words like \\"thoughtful\\" are on the mark.  This isn't jazz or fusion music that most of us could conceivably play in our car, or use as background while we work out.  It only makes sense as music that one would sit down and listen to with some concentration - appreciating the fragmented pulse (Alphonse Mouzon sounds good here, giving the occasional illusion of form and pulse to the music) and the open tonal qualities inherent in this group's style.<br /><br />There aren't obvious themes going on in much of the playing - it's \\"open\\", i.e. relatively \\"free\\" playing.  Now, I have to say, it seems pretty clear to me that the group is trying to summon the dark, spacey, and polyrhythmic mood of the \\"Bitches Brew\\" era sessions which Zawinul and Shorter had been involved in.  Clearly all four players (I'm not counting the percussionists) had heard that music and aspired to do something similar.  But with more elements of free jazz strewn into the mix.  And more room left in the music to hear the bass player's every note.<br /><br />I don't hear this as an especially brilliant set of tracks.  I think that if the band hadn't progressed and moved into other directions - music that grabbed the listener's attention - it wouldn't be remembered as a particular classic.  I think that the Miles Davis music it takes its cues from is denser, heavier, and more successful.  That's how I hear it - maybe that opinion doesn't give Zawinul and Shorter their due for helping to create that earlier music, but that's what my ears are telling me.
B008EKMGPA|2.0|This was a rather novel setting for the opera in an English school. While the singing was very good, as well as the acting, the interpretation is weird. I prefer a more traditional production. It seems arrogant on the part of opera producers to reject tradition in favor of their own fads. If you look at the box cover, it appears traditional. But, you will not get tradition. You get a sorceress who is some type of sex freak with punk-mod girls as her assistance.Traditional opera setting as required by the composer provides us with real insight into the past and the composer's mind. A really good traditional production can complement our understanding of some of the great CD recordings.
0425263916|5.0|I love love love this Crossfire Series!  Full of hot sex and great story line.  I could not believe the way it ended & cannot wait for the 3rd book.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It works.  I really like this movie.  Great ending to a great series.  Loved all the actors and cinematography. yay
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Got this movie for my daughters and they have watched it like ten times since then. Great Blu-ray movie .
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of my all time favorite books. When I finished it I felt a void- almost as if I had lost a dear friend
B005IF7HNA|3.0|I received the blu-ray complete box series of Torchwood - seasons 1 & 2 and the mini-series \\"Children of Earth\\" (CoE) and \\"Miracle Day\\" (MD).  Everything was running smoothly until I opened the MD set of discs - NONE PLAYED! There are four discs in the MD collection and none of them played! I tired my other blu-ray player with the same result. I could not figure out what was special about the MD discs that wouldn't allow them to play versus the discs from seasons 1&2 and the CoE?? Will be sending it back but this definitely discourages me from further video purchases. I had always heard the horror stories of Amazon deliveries and the inability to contact any form of customer service.  [[ASIN:B005IF7HNA Torchwood: Series 1-4 Box Set [Blu-ray][Region Free]]]
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Having not watched the series early on, I had no idea what was going on so being able to watch the series beginning to end now has me hooked!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I would love if it had a few more songs. But loved it nonetheless. I bought it as mp3 version and have it on all my electronic devises.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better than Book One.  Read it on my commute to and from work.  Love it.  Can't wait to start Book Three
B009WO7NQO|5.0|How can you not love this game??  It is angry birds and star wars all rolled up into a wonderful pkg!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very addictive, but it feels like bad things happen to my town every five minutes which can be annoying. The only other complaint I would have is when the items you need to complete a quest cost dollars instead of coins. I prefer not to pay to play.
3438052229|5.0|Teachers of the Hebrew Bible will be glad to use and recommend this small paper-back edition of the widely acclaimed Tanach, the full text of the Hebrew Bible based on the Leningrad Codex, with ample critical apparatus and helpful &#34;prolegomena&#34; in German and English.  The print is clear and the size will appeal to students who have much weightier tomes to carry to class.
0374275637|5.0|Not a read for everyone.  But, if you love reading about how our thinking is effected, and how the brain interprets, this is for you.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very well written.  The secret does not even hint until close to the end.  The description of life in England during the bombings of WWII is also interesting.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|A very Predictable story line. I've  Seen this type of story too many time. TIred of Clint's crotchity old man routine.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|Sometimes it works and other times it won't work but when it works its fun I wish I could be a little too UN real over  it's way over price rip off
B000085RPU|1.0|DVD was purchased as a gift for christmas,. once the recipent opened it to play it he realized the DVD wouldnt work. I was very un happy with the fact that it did not work
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I would totally recommend this game if you love hidden object/adventure games. Great graphics, cool storyline. Can zoom if you need to and hints are available.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The idea of being stranded on Mars, presumed dead and with no rescue in sight, but a willingness to survive is handled well and with a certain humour.  The engaging and light hearted way this is written doesn't trivialise the plot nor distract from the plight of our primary character, Astronaut Mark Watney, botanist, optimist and enthusiast engineer.<br /><br />He is wounded, lost in a dust storm, suffers failure of equipment and the fundamental problems that no one knows he is alive.  A rescue is over a year away, and he will starve to death in a third of that time...  But that isn't going to stop him from trying.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Great game for kids and adults . My grandsons love it . Would recommend it highly . A fun game.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Pros:<br />-Doesn't get much better for the price.<br />-The elastic shock mount actually works fairly well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Shock mount is a bit fragile and you may have to re secure the rubber bands from time to time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|5 stars even though it sometimes crashes on the Kindle. This app is fantastic. The download feature allows you to save movies to be viewed later, or off line. It's really allowed me to use youtube to the fullest.<br /><br />The crashes occur when I fiddle with search. Still this get so much use it's 5 stars!
B00005LELD|5.0|I was so impressed with this design!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Durable rubber<br />-Protects lens<br />-Folds up while still attached to lens for easy compact storage!!!!<br /><br />Cons: Nothing so far.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great buy. Comes in a really well designed box and all the movies looked fantastic.  Cheap price for all three, too!
B002KV74ZG|5.0|I first saw this back in 2005.  I watched it again.  The story line never drug it's feet.  It was interesting plot and unfolded well.  I like Keanu Reeves.  He played this part well.
B00973CGXK|2.0|I'm kinda just okay about this album.  Not the best.  I wonder if I'll ever like another one of the Killer's albums after Hot Fuss cause I really have not.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Watched with the family.  Cute movie for out little ones and big ones too!  I liked this movie cartoon yeah!
B00A12VJZM|5.0|This is a great collection of The Rolling Stones work.  All the songs I've always loved as well as some less heard and new songs are on there.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I liked this story and was skeptical to watch it.  The plot developed nicely....did not fall asleep the second time around.  Had plenty of action and they put it together to link what happened fictiously during the civil war.  I liked the ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book really surprised me! I've read all of Colleen Hoovers books and I'm now a fan. She writes with such passion and the characters come alive. This is a must read, you will get sucked in from the very start.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|The movie was great. My only problem with it is that it requires a video player that I had to borrow.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the characters. It was thrilling and sad all at the same time. Great plot with an interesting ending and a fantastic message. I can't wait for the movie to come out to bring these characters alive!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I gave &#34;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#34; 5 stars because I liked the picture.  I recommend it to Judy Dench fan.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Great show!! And even better price!! Went to other retailers and the price for this was double!!! Love vampire diaries...new favorite show!!
B009E3EYS8|5.0|The CD has all the songs I have listened to in the past.  The DVD shows a concert that I had never attended and seeing it on my TV with my surround sound system made me feel like I was right there live at the concert.<br />Thank You
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows to come out since Game of Thrones.  I caught on late, but now am hooked.
0062127241|5.0|I just started to read the book, and I am finding things about, Pete Townshend's life as a young boy that I did not know.  So far it is a good read and I would recommend the book to anyone who is a true WHO fan.  Pete is one of the best guitarist that ever played the guitar.<br />Thank You
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I caught on late to this TV phenomenon, but am now completely hooked on it.  I can't wait for the 2nd half of Season 3 to premiere on February 10th, 2013.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I LOVE This book so so so so much I read it 3 Times I am 9 wow best book ever!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Room is told entirely from the point-of-view of a five-year-old. The writing is unlike anything else I've read before and I'm still unsure if that's a good thing or not. The narration takes a while to get used to and, even by the end of the book, I still wasn't thrilled about it. I must say that I felt Jack was done very well. Jack seems like other five-year-old boys that I know. He's naive, selfish, and slightly annoying. While all of these things might sound bad, when in context, they aren't. He's a child and, even given his circumstances, he's a lot like a child should be. Emma Donoghue did a really great job at making Jack come to life and made an excellent choice in having him narrate the story. I believe it's much more powerful through his eyes as opposed to his Ma's.<br /><br />[Very minor spoilers here] A few things that I didn't enjoy: the talk of breastfeeding (which is never actually referred to as such). It made me pretty uncomfortable. I'm not against breastfeeding in any way. I'm not even against breastfeeding a child of Jack's age (not that I could do it personally). I understand that breastfeeding brought comfort to Jack and Ma. I just don't want to hear a child talking about which breast tastes better and which is creamier. It was downright weird, in my opinion. Another thing that I found really weird was Ma letting Jack keep her rotten tooth. Really? How is that okay? He's sucking on it. I cannot possibly be the only one that thinks that's really gross. I know I'm nitpicking, but these things really stood out and bothered me.<br /><br />Overall, this book is difficult for me to review. I've read many reviews where people say you'll either love it or hate it and that's just not true in my case. I definitely didn't love Room, but I didn't hate it, either. I can't really recommend or not recommend it to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just as thrilling and captivating as Twilight. I couldn't put the book down and can't wait to start book two and three and see how the series ends.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Any one who loves fanciful enchantment would love this movie. Its exciting and full of treats. Anyone who liked the previous ones will love this one. The only draw back is its fairly short but packed with spice. Enjoy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's fun as well as a time passer. Some of the games are confusing to me but there are some fun games
B0001CVAME|1.0|I purchased the Freaky Friday DVD from delciousdeals in the UK and it turns out DVD's from there don't play in american DVD players
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|The game is easy to play. The steps to figure out the thinking games are sometimes hard if you try to over think.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Great Movie! Denzel Washington stars in a role different from anything he's ever done. Ryan Reynolds is just beautiful and does a great job in this movie.
B007HJ8LOE|5.0|This is my favorite film ever.  Makes me cry tears of joy every time.<br />You need to see this film
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this story down. I was lost in the pages and I can not wait for the movie.
B005VOXQ1U|5.0|He was exactly as described and arrived promptly.  My grandson is delighted with his gorilla as he was with all of his Amazon Schleich Whales, Sharks, and Dinosaurs.
B006LSZECO|1.0|vulga language hit me the first few pages and I just couldn't connect with the story. I returned it thru Kindle.
1594203334|4.0|A friend of mine gave me this book because I'm 24 weeks pregnant and she heard from another woman that the book was very helpful to her. Bringing up Bebe is an interesting, anthropological case study conducted over a three year period by an American woman who is living and raising children in Paris. She decided to study the habits, disciplinary actions, and general thoughts behind French parenting once she noticed that French children behave much differently than American kids. This book is extremely insightful. Whether you believe in and apply all of the French tactics is up to the reader, but there are definitely some nuggets of wisdom to be learned from the French. My favorite observations are how the French get their kids to sleep through the night very early by not catering to their infants the second they begin to cry. They pause just a bit to see if the crying means they need something or whether they have woken up from a sleep cycle, cry a bit and then go back to sleep. I definitely plan to practice this when my baby girl arrives to see if it indeed works... Other helpful tips include teaching children the art of waiting and not making them the center of the universe which leads to a lot of whining, demands, and entitlement later on. I would recommend this book to expectant moms and new parents. It's a quick read with some definite learnings.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|...I would never have wantd to see the show.  Much has been made about the live singing performances on film -- letting the actors feel in the moment.  The film-makers found their hook -- no one would dare criticize such a bold move.  The result is music that I love but on a CD that I cannot recommend to anyone.  In acting the singing they have given up much of the inspiration found in the music.  I just wanted to shoot them and put them all out of their misery.  Buy the stage versions.  Well acted -- not well sung.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|This product works well with apple I pad one, real apple product new in box, as stated in the ad
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my wife.  She loves this program.  She will watch the same episode over and over again.
B00A8V3VVG|2.0|modern day  soundtracks  tend  to go all  over the  place  and this  one  floats along the same stream.  it  dares  to  be versatile  and  take  you on a  trip, problem  here is  while  there  are some  interesting cuts, nothing  truly  knocks  me  out  and its  missing that  certain  punch  to  make  it leap  out and grab  you.  much  like  the  film, its uneven  and  has  more bark than  bite.
B001BC5HXG|4.0|After reading Of Mice and Men I chose to read East of Eden because I liked the style of Steinbeck. I knew that Steinbeck knew how to tell a good story and with this book he did not fail. However, the story was a long one. It took exactly 601 pages. But, other than the length the story of East of Eden is that of a family and the struggles of marriage and life in an unknown land. It illustrates very well the hardships of growing up with a single father or mother. It is also riddled with biblical allusions. The main biblical allusion is what encompasses the whole story is the story of Cain and Abel. This appears with the many conflicts that occur between the brothers in this story. It also encompasses a frame device where Steinbeck through flashbacks tells a story of family heritage playing a role in the future. Overall East of Eden is a great book that I would recommend to anyone who has the time to read this book.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Great app, enjoyed playing it. So did my wife and granddaughter. Good buy. Don't miss it--you can download more songs. They rate from easy to challenging.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|To my uttermost surprise when I opened the package, I found within it a thick, new-looking set of DVDs.  The description I had attained from the seller wasn't that convincing.  Overall it cost me $5.  A great deal.  I intend to give it as a Birthday gift.  Thanks guys! God bless you all!
B009SQR28A|5.0|Very Cheeky and humorous Santa Movie, done by the brits. One of those movies with two levels of humor for adults and kids.

B0091QS88K|5.0|Like the other Dr. Panda apps, it is visually appealing & educational. After a while, it can become repetitive & predictable, but hey it's free & there's other ones to work into the mix. My son loves it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I loved this game a lot before this game crashed on my Kindle Fire. It was one of my favorite apps. If it didn't crash this would be five stars!
B00A0SK8RC|5.0|If you thought HD was nothing more than a novelty then this is a movie you should see. Some of the details (Adrian smiling/ Santa Beard on Rock Marciano) stand out like never before and really do add to the movie and its story.
B008220D5K|1.0|I just dont get how anyone could like or find this movie funny.A little cleverness or subtlety goes a long way and there  is none in this movie.Just trying to get laughs fron crude toilet jokes that are about as funny as a shark attack. Sadly there are people who enjoy this type of trash.
0307352145|4.0|This book is insightful in helping to understand introverts.  I was able to recognize many of the characteristics of an introvert in myself.  This book is helpful in understanding the benefits of introverts and how to deal with introverts.  I especially enjoyed the parts related to extroverted parents working with their introverted children.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Nice and compact. Easy to use and very effective at cleaning up dull blades. That won't be razors but they will do a very good job of cutting. One issue I have is that the finger slots should have some stipling or checkering to enhance the grip. I used skateboard tape.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I was so excited for his first release and I was not disapointed. It is well done and the songs<br />I could play it over and over.  I am so happy for Philip he really delivers with this CD, The World<br />From The Side Of The Moon.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Raunchy, hilarious, hearthwarming comedy for grown ups...I would recommend this but mostly for more mature adult humor. Need parental guidance.

B0012GMVXU|5.0|Leonard Cohen is, of course, a lyricist and poet extraordinaire. He is also a humble gentleman, so when it comes to the instrumental side of his albums he gives his producers and musicians a great measure of artistic freedom, hence during the eighties was quite susceptible to the popular production sounds of the day, he also became enamored of the space a simple synthesizer created for him to compose the scaffolding of his brilliant songs. So, for many Cohen fans who were used to the sparse, largely acoustic and more organic sounds of the sixties and seventies material, 'Various Positions' and 'I'm Your Man' came as a bit of a jarring surprise- although these albums also recruited some new listeners who's tastes sprouted concurrently with the style of the times.<br />It was, at first, a let down for me to hear the near absence of Leonard's charismatic guitar pickings; his fragile strums and the sparse, raw accompaniments provided by his previous session musicians. Eventually though, I came to appreciate the new sounds for what they were and was able to appreciate the symbiosis of the highly polished and arguably over-produced music backing Cohen's deepened voice (\\"100,000 cigarettes deeper.\\" -L.C.) and intensely charismatic songs. I think it probably helped open my mind to the sounds of that decade more in general, so thanks for that, Leonard!<br />Fantastic, ultimately timeless album containing some of his most enduring, solid songs (as do most of his records) that I highly recommended.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I won't breakdown and analyze each individual track but this album as a whole absolutely rocks! If you are a Rush \\"fan\\" and don't immediately love it, you should keep playing it - because Rush's musical brilliance is there if you are open-minded enough to really listen for it. If you are reading the reviews due to an indecision to buy Clockwork Angels...don't waste another day and just do it.<br /><br />I believe that most people that download and buy only single tracks are cheating themselves because you must listen to Clockwork Angels from start to finish. This is a concept style album which Rush fans have come to enjoy and this is no exception, so I strongly recommend having enough time to listen to Clockwork Angels in it's entirety. While most significant rock music artists of the last 40 years are \\"nursing\\" their careers with greatest hits tours and uninspiring new music, Rush hasn't lost their fire or creativity.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book and liked the way it was written.  The sympathy for the characters switches very cleverly.<br />It took me a while to get into it, then it was a good read.
030758836X|4.0|I wish I had read this book when it first came out because I feel that I was a little let down since I didn't think it was the best book I've ever read like most people I know.  It was good and very entertaining.  When the movie comes out, I am sure I will see it.  The book is broken up into a few sections but don't be tempted to look ahead, it ruins it a little bit.  Great for a travel read when you have some time to spend a large chuck reading.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This feels like a game you would pay decent money for on the computer or a game console, but it's here on the Kindle for free!! You get to pick your character's sex and species/specialty and buy weapons and armor. It's an easy game to learn and play and keeps my interest (which is hard to do). Lots of fun, best game EVER!!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|It's a great, funny movie--watch it every year around Christmas!  If you want a good laugh, buy this movie.  You'll get your monies worth!
1616284382|5.0|Snow White is 75! Had this autographed by the author in San Francisco at the Walt Disney Family Museum. The story behind the art work for the film is great and the art work included is great! It's an historical feature length animation that we love...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These are great books to read! Highly recommended! My entire family has borrowed these books from me. I read all 3 books in two weeks!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|First - I don't take ANY film too seriously.  I'm looking for entertainment, not a source for my world view. With that background in mind, I thought this was a great movie.  Action, interesting characters, neat \\"toys\\" - this film had it all.  I really enjoyed it.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Great band! This item shipped in a good amount of time. I was very satisfied! My dad loves this band, and he is not into music. :)
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I was a huge fan of season 1.<br />I Loved all the creepy characters and how they interacted with eachother. It was actually scary.<br /><br />Season 2. I watched 3 episodes and never went back. Unthinkable Rape, and severe torture, along with discusting characters. There is no way that many evil demented people would all work in one place without a caring sole in sight. It is not scary its discusting. I was severely disappointed. While Jessica Lang does a fantastic job of acting. I still could not watch this crap. I will not watch this season. . I love a good horror story but this is just filth. Bring back the creepy scary wonderful characters in season 1.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This wonderful book is real life.  I laughed, cried and now that I've finished it, think about it constantly.  Thank you John Green!  You've given us an inside look at what so many people are actually going through and you've managed to show us all aspects through the characters.  I will recommend this to every one of my relatives and friends.<br /><br />Sandy, Buffalo, WY.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I especially enjoyed this novel by V. Flynn. Hard to stop reading right from the first chapter,  I highly recommend.for people who like thrillers.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|my grandson spends a lot of time on the TV with this series.  i thought this was the perfect Christmas gift for him -- and he loves it!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book, told by the point of view of the dog, is poignant and touching, keeps your attention with a gripping plot line and mesmerizing characters.  I did find that sometimes there was redundancy in the telling of the tale, but not so much that is distracting long term or to the discredit of the plot.  Overall, a very enjoyable read.
B005KELW26|5.0|So far so good. It arrived on time and intact. It holds the Kindle Fire well, but has not had a true test yet. Wating to see how it performs in summer weather.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|A little expensive but well worth the price tag!  Unlike USA network, you will have the entire season in order not bits and pieces of each season.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He has all the books and I believed the DVDs would complete the set. I truly learned that the DVDs were just a season and not the entire book series. Now, I am drawn in with my husband, but DVDs. Amazon is the best online order source and if I cannot find it at Amazon, it does not get purchased!
B006O3MU96|3.0|I am just deleting this app because I haven't really been using it all that much, and would like to free up the space on my Kindle.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Beautiful recording of old icon, best I have ever heard this album sound.<br />SACD at its best. Buy it whatever age you are.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I'm just checking.  This woman's voice is something else.  And her lyrics are (1) interesting and (2) different.  Lana has a loyal fan for life - especially if she ends up marrying me.  I mean... for better or for worse, right?
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like checking out all the different ideas. Did various crafts and organizing info. Gives you very helpful information to use.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I wasn't tired when I started watching this move, but quickly I became tired.  Tons of hype, no bite.  Disappointing.
B008PALI5S|4.0|It was February of 2012 when -for two weeks- Dudamel and both the SBSO and the LAP walked through the whole Mahler's Symphony repertoire on the Teatro Teresa Carreño. The tickets sold too fast -the TTC is not a large venue, around 2500 people capacity- so I was only able to get tickets just for the 5th Symphony (A memorable evening with one of Mahler's best).<br /><br />The 8th is a very demanding piece of work divided in two parts. The Part I is a sort of spectacular Oratorio-Cantata; Part II is an extended musically-multifaceted affair containing some of the most beautiful music that Mahler ever wrote. Due to all the forces required -Two mixed Choirs, a Children Choir, 8 soloists and an enlarged orchestra plus an organ- it makes the symphony a difficult one to perform and a nightmare to rehearse properly. In the case of this particular performance the numbers were about 1200 singers and a 200-people orchestra. Under Dudamel's baton it is a solid performance -even more so when you realize it's a live single-shot performance- with some rough parts here and there, but with an undeniable raw sense and lots of visceral power, and showing the musicianship of all involved. Certainly there are better or more refined versions out there (Georg Solti and the CSO, Leonard Bernstein and the WPO, Vaclav Neumann and the CPO, Robert Shaw and the ASO just to name a few) but most of them are \\"studio\\" recordings made through several different sessions and with smaller, somehow more manageable forces. The great value of this disc is to have captured an entrancing performance of this symphony in all its magnificence and sheer scale that -being prohibitive, seldom is the rule nowadays.<br /><br />The 1080i video is serviceable and detailed with some stunning vistas of the 1200 choristers performing. The DTS-Master HD audio is a little uneven: it was close-miked in sectors -you can hear cracking chairs or steps all over the place- and the perspective is lost in some others. I know thatfor the Deutsche Grammophon's technicians had to be some kind of nightmare to deal with the TTC acoustics (The TTC is a venue designed to be fit for many uses -concert, ballet, opera, etc. - but not particularly good at any, and it has no built-in organ) and the too-many musicians, but the end result is a somehow anemic bass-lacking sound.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Why, Dolph Lundgren, does the audio not match up with your lips... ever?  Enough said.  Well I'll say a little more - Jason Statham was the only person acting in this movie.  He gets a pass.
B00004R99F|5.0|I got exactly what I want so I can't complain. Arrived quickly just before Christmas so that was a bonus.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is a great movie.  I purchased it for streaming from Amazon.  We will surely watch it for many years.
B000056HE9|4.0|Got on time and product fine. Do wish the cover would have been the one I thought I was ordering as more attractive that the cover I received.
B008476HBM|5.0|There is a reason this book has been around for 200 years. Its tale of human nature. Is timeless. The tale of love and miss understanding is equally timeless.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|Some movies invite  diatribe: \\" a bitter, abusive, prolonged, discourse, festooned with eloquent, stinging criticsm\\"<br />Just take a look at some of the other reviews, such as 'worst movie ever' . This is the second move with a great actor, Paul Giamatti, playing a pivotal role ( Barney's Version ) wherein we are \\"entertained\\" by not a single human soul in the story with a working moral compass. We ruthlessly exploit the world for staggering wealth and power?, with each character displaying in fine form their \\"Self Totality, utterly without remorse of any kind\\". We drink, we fornicate with whomever, and whatever female is in the scene,; we ruthlessly knock about, beat, kill, and destroy people & property on all sides, in an ever darkening<br />slide of humanity into nihilist ooze. ( nihilist: \\" a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence is senseless and uselss; Oooze: \\"to emit slowly, that which is often seen as faintly repellant\\" In a word, the director left out a good long straining bowel movement ~ although he did favor us with a prolonged prostate examination.)<br /><br />The one saving grace of this film might be that this is a new kind of horror movie that you would take your fresh faced, naive young high school sweetheart to. But instead of the creature from the black lagoon causing her to shiver and lean towards you, offering you that golden opportunity to slip your arm over her shivering shoulders, as she asks her knight in shining armor,<br />... \\" Uh..have you got a clue yet what is going on here yet ?\\" To which you explain in soft, erudite terms that this is how these artists, writers, directors and producers, from ammoral sleazebag, s_ _ _ hole Hollywood, with vast gobs of money to waste, who wish us to see how the world will finally completely unravel in unspeakable, insane, and terrifying self destruction\\". And she then gazes up into his kind face, with a sweet smile, that says, \\"I feel so safe with you; you're so smart. Can we go somewhere nice and have share a malt soda?...and then go make out on Jump Off Mountain?\\" Bingo. Yes, follow your instinct. Leave.Stop torturing your self.<br /><br />Or..you could force her to sit through the whole thing, all the way to its ineffable, insane horrific denoument...but my guess is that she won't go out with you again...meaning you would so totally not score. Just go ahead, and leave. Or better yet, throw it on the crackling fire in the fireplace, just to see it crumple up and stink itself into oblvivion. And the two of you do the fist pump thing, shouting \\"Yes!\\"..and then start making out, victorious over slime, stench , and filth.o smart. Can we go somewhere nice and have share a malt soda?...and then go make out on Jump Off Mountain?\\" Bingo. Yes, follow your instinct.

B009FRD8TY|4.0|This is a good album to buy if you like old school torch songs. I have never considered buying a Kylie Minogue before but after hearing her perform one of the songs live I decided to give it a try. It's good. Has a Diana Krall vibe to it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love it. Never know what is going to happen. Wish it would go year long!! The whole cast is great. Love Mandy Patankin.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Most movie series reach their peak with the first film and then go downhill from there. Not so with Men IN Black. After getting this BR I went back and watched A marathon of the films and realized that this is the best one. The performances are outstanding, in particular Josh Brolin as young agent K. His Tommy Lee Jones is uncanny. The story is much more personal this time around with moving ending that may even move you to tears. But don't forget this is Men In Black and that means lots of comedy all of which is very funny. Highly recommended.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The story was, more than anything, a study of humanity and its grappling with good and evil, individual and host values, while setting the story amidst the fight for survival of the  human race. I loved reading this book, and read it in 2 short days.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|When the continent begins to breakup, Manny, Sid and Diego find themselves stranded on an ice flow trying to get back to the others. Bring on a group of pirates led by an evil ape captain. The rest of the movie is about the pirates chasing our heroes all over the place with a sup-plot about teenage rebellion involving Manny's daughter Peaches. A good entry in the series but the the best one is still Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Ordered as a gift.  Recipent was very happy to receive it and to my knowledge all is well with the DVD.  Got the order ASAP prompt.  Thank you!
B007REV4YI|5.0|The opening sequence literally gave me goosebumps. After that the movie continued to keep me interested. The plot basically involves Bond having a crisis of faith about his job but when those he love are threatened and lives are lost he comes around. One performance that is overlooked but I think was one of my favorites was Naomi Harris as the main Bond girl. The movie is highly entertaining and like the books does not have the clean ending where everyone lives happily ever-after. A must see.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app was OK when I first got it but then after I watched a video, it forced closed by itself.  I tried uninstalling it from my kindle, but it still did the same thing!  I would advise kindle fire owners not to get this.
B009EELBIS|5.0|I chose this rating because I love this movie and to be able to be on the road and watch it while husband is driving is wonderful.<br />This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book and speechless about the end of the book.Can't wait to read the next book. Even though I already read it.
0399245030|5.0|I'm slowly buying all these books for my nephew because I love them so much! The imagery is just fantastic and the stories are fun for kids and adults.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It makes me think and giggle. Fun time waster!  If the full version wasn't $5, I'd buy it to get rid of the annoying ads.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I have been looking for something like this for awhile for my Kindle and you can't get better than free plus my 9 year old loves it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one allowed you to get to know Grey better. He was actually more humane that he originally appeared. It was more than just a book about sex. It has an actual story line about two people in a relationship and how they really felt about each other no matter what anyone else thought.Great book.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint beautifully portrays  the irascibility of many a grandpa, from the point of view of the sexagenarian rather than his undisciplined modern sons' families. Becoming acquainted with a troubled Korean neighbourhood after his wife's death enables him to adopt and shepherd a family despite failing to guide or love his own children.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|on iphone and android there was a NYC world tour update well where is the kindle update everyone has the update exept us. this is not right
B001CDWFPC|5.0|And now I have one for my Kindle. I find the Kindle an excellent study tool and love being able to work back and forth between translations with ease.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game, endless levels to play.  The concept might get a little old for some, but still fun to play.  If you enjoy puzzles and like things that are free it is worth the 4 seconds it takes to download the game.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is exactly what it says it is, &#34;Amazon BASICS.&#34;  It can't be compared in features with a LowePro, ThinkTank or similar bag, but I like that its exterior doesn't scream, &#34;LOOK I HAVE AN EXPENSIVE CAMERA BAG!&#34;<br /><br />I checked fit and finish and the seams all appear to be well sewed.  I was able to pack it with a dSLR with 28-300 mm zoom attached; three lenses (a wide angle zoom; a macro; a 50 mm prime); a speedlight; assorted filters; and other small photographic necessities.<br /><br />There are straps to attach a small tripod to the side, but I would have preferred to have a tripod attached down the middle of the back, not on one side making the whole thing lopsided.  A minor complaint for a bag at this price.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This one was just as good if not better then the first.  Alot of action. there is where  it got me plus there is some comedy inserted which enhances the flick.  A good movie for your library  If you like Stallone et al you will go for this
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Really good book, they all die at the end, and the little girl is immune to the flare virus PENIS
B001NHNG64|4.0|Nice read. A bit like an American version of the old James Bond movies. Full of suspense, hard to find a stopping point.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome story of one man's account while serving his country. His testimony and sacrafice was most inspiring. A great book to pass along to others.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I wish there were more dance scenes! Channing is an incredible dancer. Highly recommend this movie for Channing fans. For what the movie is about, it is decent movie.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The box was very compact and neatly organized!!  I ordered this as a gift for a friend and she was very happy with it!
B008L1DNGI|1.0|Tried downloading this app several times, would start to work then stop, very disappointed. Like to try them out before buying
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|This was simply a great movie.  I've always admired George and this movie confirmed my admiration.  I appreciate even more his spiritual search in addition to his music.  It certainly covers the Beatles period but also how he grew beyond that and stardom.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series is the most well done English drama I have seen.  Being new to the story-line, I am completely captivated and now, hooked on the series!  More Please!!!!!!
B005LAIISA|5.0|I usually don't go for one two three movies, once a movie is done, its supposed to be done, but this is a good movie, glad I bought it. and we watch the ice age movies from time to time on a regular basis for a good laugh..glad to have this one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Liked the book.  I think it could have been a little more in-depth.  Still, it was a great read. Reading the next one.
0817439390|5.0|I just recently purchased a dslr camera and started to learn more about photography.  This books really tells you everything you need to know about going from simply having the camera on auto to taking pictures on manual.  The pictures do a great job of showing you how the same picture looks taken with different settings (aperture, ISO, shutterspeed, white balance) and his analogies made understandings things like ISO much easier.  I highly encourage anyone with an interest in photography to purchase this book it is highly useful.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Excellent!! Maybe better than Keith Richards - \\"Life\\"! Detailed, self-reflective, honest, compelling,<br />Worth the read 4 any Rock & Roll fan.
0316228532|3.0|I don't like the pornographic style in some chapters. But it seems books nowadays must have a good portion of sex and violence and f-words to make a selling. Very descriptive and not relaxing at all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This just totally captured my attention and I couldn't stop reading it! I definitely recommend this book. It was amazing!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Totally love the music and the show!  Hope the CDs continue.  I do wish &#34;Fade into You&#34; was included, though.
1550379151|5.0|This is a story I give to every new baby girl in my universe! It is fun, adventurous, silly, and still teaches the lesson of self reliance. Great to add to a library where most princesses wait to be 'saved' by the prince.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son loves this, it's his favorite pacifier! I will be buying more of these. Everyone that sees it thinks it's so cute!!
B005L38QK2|1.0|i gave extra time for holidays but after reviewing steelseries return history it's not about that. people pay to ship in defective products and never get replacement or even response. my return window closed aug. 6 here at amazon so i'm eating this :(
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you're a hardcore sci-fi fan you will love this movie.<br /><br />If you're a special effects junkie you will love this movie.<br /><br />I am neither, but I still very much enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />The acting is good. The directing is superior. There's plenty of action. The women are gorgeous and the men are (for the most part) heroic. The plot . . . well, it wanders a bit (at times I found myself saying \\"Whoa! Did I miss something?\\") but the film's better elements usually carry the ball past the plot's weak points. Don't look for deep philosophical perspectives or ethical conundrums; this is a fun film. If you're a devotee of the genre (or maybe just bored some evening) give it a try.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This was a gift for my 23 year old daughter. She must have watched Annie a million times as she grew up. Thank heavens it was usually with her grandmother:) When she opened it on Christmas morning, she saw only the back of the cover but let out a shout of glee as she realized that it was &#34;Annie&#34;. I would recommend this movie if you like musicals and love to sing along. We all belt out &#34;Tomorrow&#34; each time we watch.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook and it works great on my kindle fire HD.  The app loads up and i have not had any problems with it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I started reading these out of boredom and it slowly took over my life. This series is literary heroin. I will forever love and hate GRRM for writing and starting this horrible addiction I now have for this series.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Even though I love the special effects in this movie, the original Total Recall storyline was much better. The two female characters in the movie rocked.
B0083EW97W|4.0|Hey, it's John Mayer.<br />'Nuff said!<br />I haven't had time to listen to this one yet, but I'm sure to wear out the Cloud replaying it!
B000X9G69C|4.0|I was teens during the 70's and once in a while I like to play albums from the day when record stores were the place to hang out and pick up supplies.
B0086700CM|4.0|I know I will enjoy this game when I tire of my current addiction. Thank you for making it affordable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really enjoyed the books on this series. I couldn't put the book down and wanted to know what would happen.  I enjoy reading books that can capture me within the few pages. Enjoy and apply reading.
B0045NDVFE|4.0|Love this album - great price too.  Seeing the Band in concert soon!  They are a great country band for 3 people.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I used this for a year instead of the stock browser on my Motorola Xoom Android tablet. I loved it's features, ease of bookmarks, tabbed browsing, custom assignable gestures like making an arrow swipe like this:< equate to clicking the back button, or write a 'G' with your finger as a shortcut to Google. I especially liked that you could force it to display only desktop versions of websites vs. mobile versions. BUT, the new version which replaced HD when Android jellybean came out is not nearly as good. For some reason, so of my frequently visited message board site don't display properly, with some of the text much lighter than the rest making them difficult to read. The worst thing is it's disabled flash so sites like Amazon Prime are useless(which doesn't support Android yet worked perfectly on the old Dolphin browser using Honeycomb). You can sideload flash so that it will work on other sites using other browsers like Foxfire, but Dolphin disables it if you do. (prime doesn't work with any browser yet other sites do, what's up with THAT Amazon?)
B008B68IUY|5.0|My daughter loves this car.  She put her Scaris dolls in it and took it for a ride.  It is really cute and it is her favorite color.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I really appreciate how Flynn writes. It is gripping, her characters are interesting and her stories are fresh. However, there is never a redeeming character trait that makes me like any of her characters. They are all either seriously disturbed or on the verge of being seriously disturbed. It made me feel seriously disturbed. I wish she would write a novel where I could actually connect with a character in some small way.
B008B68J2G|5.0|We are saving this for her birthday which is a few weeks after Christmas.  I can't wait to give it to her.  She is a true Monster High fan.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever! Probably the best book of the series so far. I cant wait to read the last book!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I pre-ordered my copy of The Dark Knight Rises due to my love of Batman, and I received it quickly and without fault. I've watched the blu-ray and the picture quality is excellent, but I'm also really glad to have the DVD copy as part of the package. This would be a great buy for anyone really, but especially so for Batman lovers and Christopher Nolan aficionados. Amazing cast, great plot (despite having a few plot holes), just a really great film on the whole.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play this version of Solitaire.  I keeps me busy for hours at a time.  Especially when I can't sleep.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Great to see this magnificent children's author translate into the adult world. Whilst I read and enjoyed all the Harry Potter books I always felt as though I was intruding into the world of young people. Now with Casual Vacancy I have experienced JK Rowling for my own age group. I loved the way the book skillfully showed different viewpoints of the same situation and served as a reminder of how the lives of people are interwoven.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This fun piano game has been enjoyed by all ages of my family. Over Christmas day, we played it probably a dozen times, singing along.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is by far the best free game I have downloaded. It is my favorite solitare game that I have tried.
B00555X8OA|5.0|A stunning masterpiece, providing a  sensible mental model of how the mind seems to work. It draws on decades of research in cognitive psychology and provides a great overview of the current state of the field via anecdotes drawn and cited from the research. The main accomplishment of this work though is consolidating all those years of research into a model that seems consistent with most of the studies: that of the slow and fast minds. Excellent and one of my most highly recommended books of all time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome, read it in less than a day.  Could not put it down.  The end is so sad for the both of them.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this game but I bought the 55 cash pack and had 49 left and they just disapeared. :(  Hat that I spent money on it and it disappeared.  Alo my friends have left me gifts and the kindle fire notifications keep saying I have gifts but nothing is showing up on the game.  Other than that it is a very addictive and fun game.

B003YUC9JI|5.0|The movie is action packed and very done. I highly recommend it anyone enjoys martial arts movie. The story line stays true to the plot of the original Karate Kid movies.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book! It was so well written, heartfelt and insightful. I would highly recommend this book to whomever is considering reading it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was chosen by my book club and besides knowing that there was a movie out, I didn't know much about the book.  I began reading and was quickly into the book.  I found the writing style refreshing.  I didn't think this story would surprise me but that it did.
0670023329|4.0|I saw a piece on 60 Minutes about the camp 14 escape and that spurred me to buy the book. The book is interesting and gives a vivid account of the draconian North Korean system. If you don't believe human rights abuse is rampant, read the book
B000063UR1|3.0|this is a good movie for those that like sci-fi. its what i would call a &#34;statement&#34; movie. its trying to make a point. and it does. we should be taking much better care of our eco-system
B000KFB4PK|1.0|The clasp on this watch was broken within a day of my son receiving it. After putting it on and taking it off a couple times, it started to fall off his wrist.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|i loved this movie. the acting is good, the sets are wonderful. its not &#34;historically&#34; accurate, but i can forgive that.
B008Y73940|5.0|Good acting,  has an honest and realistic feel to it - and yet, fully fictional, entertaining, a story where all t's are crossed at the end, with a bunch of life lessons, a plot where all falls together at the end. So not fully true to life, because here all the questions get answered at the end, but at the same time very entertaining, a moral story. Recommended. Five stars.
B0002I831S|5.0|i grew up with this series and was glued to the set every night at 6pm. its great to see all the original cast, (instead of the pretenders). all the stories are still relevent today.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I would have given 5 stars but the permissions are horrendous. I may leave this service, even though I love it because of that.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This is by far the best season and things are really starting to get good.  I can not wait for Season 6!!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart's voice and Classic Christmas Carols!  How could you go wrong?<br />Would recommend to anyone wanting a good all round Christmas CD.
