0786915749|4|I really enjoyed this book as a young adult. The characters are well done and well written. And the world is very interesting. It is staple fantasy, elves, dwarves, dragons ect but its a very engaging book to read. A great series. This would make an incredible TV series or movie with CGI. Be warned DO not buy the Animated movie, it is horrible!
B00G5G7K7O|5|Every child & adult should watch this movie!!! My granddaughters have watched this 12+ times, over half were at the theater.
B00W6XM002|5|I like candy crush soda .Wen I see I could play that I was  so happy
B002NZTZ8S|5|The story and animation was great. Beautifull color and special effects great.  I purchased the BLU RAY 3d Version. 3d not good buy the regular BLU RAY or dvd and youcan't go wrong.  Not sorry I bought it and I can play it in 2d and can enjoy it  Mario C
B007QPFGJW|4|It's fascinating to be in Oslo, Norway and to follow these characters to see their similarities and differences. Nesbo write perfectly balanced stories - always moving, intricate plots, plenty of grit.
B00F7YHDWC|5|When you get this FREE app it becomes incredible to play with.you get three tries to save characters from die from dumb things
B00DPM7TIG|5|Almost teared up in multiple spots in the book. Very well done. Beautifully captures pain of the era and the questions of life afterward.
B009WO7NQO|1|when I updated the game today I was excited then when I opened it all I got was a black screen and sent back home.
0783227434|4|Don't hesitate to buy this. So funny and ridiculous.  Some of the best one liners in this
B0002IVN9W|4|(I found this CD to be in quality condition with no injuries upon delivery.) <br /> <br />As for the CD overall, I saw this band before they became mainstream and loved them, so when I saw this CD at such a cheap price, I had to buy it. The Arcade Fire is a unique band with a variety of songs. Some of their pieces are eerie and soft, where others are up-beat and fun. I would suggest this CD to someone who is looking for a change from their average choice of music to serve as something to lessen the drastic change. The Arcade Fire is very agreeable music.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great book...a real page turner
B00BD99JMW|5|All around just great... i dont know any other way to describe it... i would suggest that everyone reads this book (although i highly suggest that everybody reads the 1st and 2nd book if you havent already)
0451197879|4|Solid psyche novel on the tortured character of Barton George Dawes as his world crumbles all around him. Enjoy!
B00IJJUIMY|3|I have been a long time fan, having read every book Michael wrote. But Harry has run out of gas and time to cede the franchise to his daughter!
B008XG1X18|4|love pinterest and this app is easy to use....I pin a lot of things then go to my desktop later to review and better see some of my pins! get this app!!!!
B007SGM084|5|This is<br />the best book i have read in a long time I cant get enough.Every woman can use a Christan Gray in there Life even if he only comes around when you need him He is good to look at and he definitly know what to do for a women. I dont want to be a submissive I definitely like to play some of the games.Christan Call Me When ur not busy okay..
B005DOKL3E|5|I have a Kindle paper-white and i wanted something that I could use to protect it when i threw it in my bag. This was perfect, it wasn't too big or bulky. The color is pretty much right on: a softer Coral. I would recommend it. Just a nice simple zippered sleeve for my kindle
B00CSR2J9I|3|Ok
B00BXKOMT6|5|Definitely one of the best books in recent years. Containing all the brutal and rough approach of modern,post game of thrones fantasy literature but executed with real story telling prowess and originality<br /><br />Being a concise 3 books affair makes it even better
B00CO52NLI|3|Pretty good
B0083SBJXS|4|RDjr at his best! Plenty of eye candy and special effects, lots of action, pretty good story development (c'mon, it's a comic book movie!) and a load of hints for a sequel.
B00004T9UF|5|The albulm Marshall Mathers LP is filled with platnium singles such as Stan, The Way I am, THe Real Slim Shady, and many more.  Another thing that I enjoy about the album is that the songs that are not played on the radio are just as good as the hits.  THe albulm has a varity of songs ranging from songs like Stan which are understanding of how life is.  Then there is aggressive songs like Kim which is graphically Violent.  I don't think people should take all of his lyrics literally but he does post some good thoughts.  People need to sort out his lyrics to figure what should be taken literally and not literally.
B00C8S9W0G|4|The problem with sequels is trying to tell an interesting continued story for those who have read the prequel yet explaining past events for new readers.  The explanations bog down the story line and distract.  This book had too many lines and too much thrown in.  In the end it was all wrapped up but you had to be patient to get there.  Garbaldon strength is in throwing in interesting antecedent information such as how to make penicillin and also the ordinary stuff like using the privy.  All the time traveling is getting unbelievable.  She did throw in a missed time mistake with Roger to make it more believable then throws in more and super po wers.  Really.  I also agree the frequent rape stuff as well as all the detailed Jaime/Claire sex is getting old.  But still a good read.  My primary genre is mystery and suspense but thus series keeps my attention and gives me a gore break.
0441008356|5|Just finished it last night. This is def. the best sci-fi book I have read this year. OUTSTANDING. Reynolds has created his view of the future and it is weird, dark, unique, and one that I want to explore. His glimpses into the past left me wanting to know more about dozens of different threads.
B00K6D1HSK|1|I just finished watching and it's nothing I've not seen before with respect to Axl & The Roses.<br /><br />The two guitarists - Bumblefoot & Rich Forteous - are shredders and are the only guitarists needed. D.J. Ashba is a mini-Axl and a waste of space and money.<br /><br />The show itself was pretty much pedestrian when it comes to the entire history of Guns & Roses - post Slash, so as far as that goes, there is no new ground being broken here.<br /><br />Thanks, but I'll pass...
0133856887|5|Great!
B008XX6J4C|5|I absolutely adore The Piano Guys. If you've not yet had the chance, be sure to visit their youtube page, for Christmas they've done a number of songs and you can listen to them there as well as watch the video of their arrangement.<br /><br />Now with that being said, this compilation by The Piano Guys features a great mix and mash of classical and modern music. My favorite track on this album is Beethoven's 5 Secrets which is a creative mash-up of Beethoven's 5th Symphony and One Directions Secrets. A Thousand Years is also beautiful. Honestly it's hard to find a track on this album that I do not like. I would highly suggest for anyone purchasing this CD or considering to purchase to check out some of the music video's for these tracks, \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" for example has a really COOL music video.<br /><br />Anyways, I hope you enjoy this CD, I know I certainly have.
B0094BB4TW|2|Seems like they have an idea and implement it without any real thought. If you have an older version...don't update it.
B0064MPXFA|4|Hooked from season one. It only gets incredibly better from here! By season 4 you'll be crying for them to release season 5. I am :(
B004HXIZVC|5|great transaction just as described
B0094LUH4A|5|Nice !!!
B002KDUDG6|5|A great cd. Michael Buble has done it again. Great songs and he has a great voice. What a personality!!! Loved it!!!
B00006AG5N|5|He's the King
B00CH3DBNQ|5|This book was so wonderfully written that once I began reading it I couldn't put it down.  Having lived in a small town in California, UNITED STATES. all my life I had no knowledge of life in the middle east.  This book was very interesting and makes me want to study more about Pakistan.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book.
0385388896|5|Great story.
B001MYIXAC|4|Let the Right One In has the trappings of some of the worst movie cliches ever; its a vampire movie, a coming-of-age story, a buddy movie- and yet it is completely unlike anything I've ever seen.     It unfolds with a quiet precision, as luminous and mesmerizing as the best of the early silent horror movies. Set in Sweden, the story follows the outcast Oskar, full of rage at the bullying of his peers, and Eli, the mysterious young girl who moves into the apartment next door. The two gradually begin to understand and love each other, accepting even the darkest and most frightening parts of the other's nature.    The violence and blood in the film is understated, in fact it gives a totally original and stunning meaning to the words \\"off-screen\\", but it is nonetheless shocking when it comes. The young actors convey a wonderful combination of solemnity and innocence, they really look and sound like children- but, all puns aside, children of the night.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Enjoyed this very much.
B00WBPTMLA|3|? . I feel the story was very slow pace . It left me looking for more  twists and turns.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good for a time killer don't care for repetitive scenes<br />Images could be better. Over all just ok. It was free so I can't complain
B00DQEB1V4|1|After researching for weeks and thinking that the negative reviews were one off's i decided to pull the trigger and buy this. After receiving, setting up and synching with Penultimate note app my experience only lasted an hour at the most with this product. As it states in a lot of the reviews the writing experience is not good and i could barely write an eligible sentence. The pen kept disconnecting and the power kept shutting off which depends on how you hold a pen in the first place. I really wanted this to work so i could use it on my iPad for notes. But unfortunately after 1 hour of use and trying everything i am returning the product for a full refund.
B000BTC5LW|5|If you had the opportunity to see Pink Floyd during the Pulse tour (Which I did!) then this DVD will take you back in time.  Although I enjoyed their \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" DVD- And yes, the DVD does exist and is a profesionally done recording, although you can only get it in PAL format, which means you'll either need an older DVD player or a multi region player to view it- it did not have all of the tracks from the concert I was looking for.  Pulse has both great sound quality and video, and I would highly recomend this DVD for any Pink Floyd fan.  It has impressed many of my friends who have never been able to see the band, and has allowed me and others who have seen them a wonderful chance to remember and reminisnse over the shows.  See you on the Dark Side...
B00BVYNSLC|5|Very entertaining. We were skeptical but now we're hooked. Good show.
B00BETX5PS|4|Great movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Action sequences that I did not expect.<br />The screenwriter has done some real crap movies in the past (Looking at you Star Trek: Nemesis).  He has apparently upped his game.<br /><br />I felt bad that I only had time to watch the movie once in the 24 hour window.
B00SM3VALA|5|Marcus Miller never misses, I like the fresh sounds from this CD
B000066I6N|5|The man does not disappoint!<br />After a superband like Zeppelin breaks up, it's always a scramble to see which of the former (surviving) members will do well on their own. In the case of Zeppelin, of course, it was all of them. This is because each individual brought to the band not only his immense musical gifts, but also a vast range of musical interests, and an attitude of openness and experimentation. The result: 24 years after John Bonham's tragic passing, Jimmy Page continues to burn down the house, John Paul Jones --- a gifted producer as well as musician and songwriter --- expands his range over rock and acid jazz to the bleeding edge of his work with Diamanda Galas. And Robert Plant brings us Dreamland. And it is exquisite.<br />The overall sound is gentle and psychedelic. Plant's gorgeous, languid voice continues to delight, yet does not overpower the contributions of the brilliant cast of assembled musicians. The songs may be covers, but Plant's arrangements make them his own. Although Plant's distinctive voice is unmistakable, this is not a sequel to Led Zeppelin III. If you enjoyed III, the overall sound of Dreamland will tickle you, but make no mistake, Dreamland is not a look back. It's evolution in motion. Give yourself a treat, and buy this album now.<br />The quest to transcend one's earlier successes can lead an artist into several traps, including ear-tormenting repetition (Stones) and sad attempts to cash in on current flash-in-the-pan trends (Aerosmith). The difficult path is one of continuous discovery and innovation. And this is the path that Plant has chosen. <br />Thanks, Percy.
B004U7JYXS|4|The films are great and its a good deal..just wish its a lot cheaper than what it is but can't complain
B00004XONN|5|This albums great and whist some of my friends sing their disapppointment towards the album, saying none of the tarcks compare to the first, I think it's a good atmospheric set of tracks. I'm happy to see a band like Radiohead experimenting with electronically generated sounds and I can safely say it's benifitted them here. Track one (what's it called again) with those lovely warm bass tones, they melt my soul. Admittedly the rest of the albums tracks don't hold the same listenability, as a whole it's a lovely dreamy listen.
0811876373|5|Lots of great ideas and designs very easy to follow and step by step instructions great for kids to. Thank You
B000N3SS80|5|I bought this CD and my mom heard it so I had to buy her one.  I absolutely love this CD!!!!!!!!!
B00K0X1PYM|5|Great cd ,excellent song selection
B00A6SZS2Q|5|Delivered as promised.
B0000X61UU|5|The reason I love celebrity workouts is because they hire really good trainers! You see her trainer every now & then or you hear him in the background coaching her. Here again all new/different exercises! This is a dance free workout that has a very different cardio segment and then ab & floor work and upper body work. It's quite challenging! It's very visual as the scene changes often to different places with Cindy in different outfits. She's not a big talker or motivator but she's inspirational to look at & workout with! She does every exercise in sets of ten (except abs - they are in sets of 20) and then changes to something else. It moves quickly so there is no boredom. The music is good. I really like this workout!!!
B005544V6A|5|After you get past the first episode and some of its tackiness, the show really develops its characters and relationships into something worth watching. The dialogue and situations get even more clever as the season progresses.
0812550706|5|I've never read anything by Orson Scott Card that wasn't at least very, very good (excellent is his usual territory). I think &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is his masterpiece (so far). (I haven't read the sequels yet, can they possibly sustain the comparison? I'll have to dive in and see.) Other reviewers have given some idea of the plot of this book, so I'll just say that very few adult or juvenile, popular or &quot;serious&quot; works of fiction in any genre can compare. It's not just my opinion; I bought the book for my nephew (one of those kids who hates to read) and he ate it up. If you like gaming and/or futuristic stories, or if you are interested in the workings of your own or others' minds &amp; hearts, read this book. It's stunningly good. If you like &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and other books in the series, don't stop there. Orson Scott Card has lots of other good stuff to offer--how about a frontier America where hexes and spells are a taken-for-granted part of everyday life?  (If this sounds interesting, check out the &quot;Seventh Son&quot; series.) I've been reading science fiction for over 20 years, and Orson Scott Card is one of very best the genre has to offer.
B009UX2YAC|4|Best endless runner in my opinion, you can't argue with free and the ads aren't bad. I like that you slide to move rather than tilting like in temple run. The daily challenges keep me commingled back every day and challenging my friends keeps me playing.
B00F52YOPA|3|novel concept combining HO with decorating as a reward for completing puzzles.  pros: nice graphics with varied HO puzzles which randomizes the type such as description list or shadow HO.  you can choose difficulty level and hint refill.  the music is pleasant and on a long loop. the game sounds are nice.  its fun to decorate the room and curiosity of what decorations come next drive the game.  cons: the premise can be a bit hard to swallow. people paying lots of cash for junk like a banana or a few bucks for treasures. also this ding bat goes to grand Mas house and starts emptying it including pets! lol. if you can get past that then the gameplay is pretty easy. the only complaint and its a big one is the zoom.  it does not scale so zooming only gives you an extremely blurred image. useless.  cost of decorations scales exponentially so a couch may cost 800 but a stereo 18000.  that's a lot of repeat rooms searches at around 600-800 per room profit.  to their credit they mix up the puzzle styles and cycle the rooms often.  objects are randomly placed as well though the same items per room.  however... none of this is important as there is a game stopping bug where the next room will not load...in my case at level 105.  in others different levels.  I enjoyed the game. wished the zoom was a real zoom with true detail and that there was more variety to the puzzles.  also some ability to move decorations and more choices in decorations will make this game a huge hit.....plus fix the bug.  until then I will wait with hope   **update, i learned via other reviews that to clear the game lvl freeze bug you just need to clear the game cache. It worked for me and I was able to continue the game, decorating fully the house and then the porch which was fun.  However, the game did bug out and the entire porch was played from one HO room, but to be honest I didnt care as I it made finding the objects super fast and easy. this only points out how repetitive the game becomes, in order to be able to buy the decorations you have to run each ho game over and over and over, each paying approx 1000 cash.  so for ex, a fountain will cost 30k, thats 30 ho puzzles to finish.  meh...  they really need to do something about that.  most peeps will just quit rather than doing hundreds of the same puzzle in order to get a static decorating item.
B001S6Y0AQ|5|I purchased the vinyl version of \\"Time Out\\" in the sixties...classic stuff. The DVD of Brubeck talking about the ideas/influences behind the writing/arranging of the songs is excellent. I wanted it to be longer. Joe Morello was a big influence in my drumming style when I played as a teenager. It's all good stuff!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I like season three because there is more of the household intrigue that was interesting in season one but absent in season two. Now we have a better understanding of the characters and their strengths and weaknesses so it's even more interesting.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but it turned out to be a very enjoyable movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Mr. Grisham is one of the great story tellers of our era.  you can feel the emotions of the characters as he describes the situations each is faced with.  This is an emotional  story as it unfolds the history of the characters involved and trying to right a wrong from the past.
B0052VUNHC|1|wow, so much to roll my eyes about with this novel. I didn't realize it was a young adult novel and bought it because of the popular reviews. Well, this book was a big disappointment in credibility. Wish the Amazon info stated it was written for 18 year olds rather than a more mature (and discerning) reader.
B00BEIYN3M|5|Attention, attention. The movie titled( we are the Miller's )was an exciting fun hilarious film. The script was very well written. The actors chosen to be in this film were perfectly chosen. I am looking forward to the sequel to this film. Well done to all involved in the production of this film.
B003YL4LYI|1|This book was ridiculously long for a book in which NOTHING HAPPENED!  The entire book was endless detail that nobody is interested in(including the characters), the introduction of new characters while doing absolutely nothing with the ones we're already familiar with and as usual, the death of those you probably like.<br /><br />We know the real world sucks, that's why we read fantasy, George. So the good guy can win for a change. Total suckfest.
B00KZ6WRAA|5|Talk to ones private
B00BLCHZC2|3|Not bad.  Not great. I would give it a 3.5 if that were an option.
0062073192|5|great ready for fans
1400067936|3|I browsed the first 20 pages of this book at a store, was dismayed by the chatty asides and general litter interspersed between the real insights, and decided to buy a pirated version. Nassim Taleb's points on randomness and philosophy are all salient, but his self-indulgent, even confessional style is bizarre and takes away from the timeliness of his message. Taleb is not above insulting people, and I imagine the acerbic commentary on other intellectuals, the financial media, and much of the rest of humanity, help sell the book. Fooled by Randomness is still a good read. But it would be 150 pages shorter if the author cut the crap and got to the points sooner.
B0000012YO|5|I have several complete recordings of these sonatas including Barenboim (wonderful), Brendel (masterful) and Kempff (classic performances). Emil Gilels, whom I heard play in NY many years ago, produces a sublime interpretation with startling majesty and insight. I would not trade off the others, but I certainly place this recording first. How sad that he died at 69 and before completing this cycle.
B000002G8H|4|This is not a five star album. HOwever, it is a sold outing by slowhand. The thing I like about this album and Clapton's solo albums in general are the hidden gems that don't get played on FM. May you never, peaches and diesel, etc. are all great songs that belie the laid back, songwriters side of Clapton that gets smokescreened under all of his guitar work. This is what he meant when he said that he was inspired by the likes of the Band and Dylan.
B0040UAYI4|5|After loading the disk and following the instructions, I used this device on games that I had for the PS3. I am a long time PC 1st person shooter player and never became good with the joy stick or gamepad that is used on consoles. This device allowed me to use the keyboard and mouse and now I am enjoying playing my games on the PS3 and my 55 inch HD TV monitor. Glad I bought this.
B007N8RULO|5|This is the one I wanted so I am happy with it. The other one by Megha I did not like so deleted that game.
0321965515|5|I read Krug's &#34;Don't make me think&#34; - and it made me think; that if you have to think, I've got to rethink what I'm thinking about what you are thinking...
B0014NDXGA|5|My husband is the golfer so I bought this for him as a gift and he loves it, no complaints
B002XTBEDI|5|I adored Return to Cranford.  It is every bit as good as the original.  Judi Dench and Julia McKenzie and the rest of the cast are simply wonderful.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|OMG sooooo addicting and fun I luv how the birds and pipes change colors and howthe bird poops while it flies lol so hard but worth for downloading lol plus it is sooooooo much like flappy bird and it's very fun anyone will luv it
014241493X|4|This is ok, a quick read. The concept of what a paper town is/was is new to me, so that was interesting. But I'm not a huge fan of his books as some people are.
B0011UF79C|4|Bought this movie for a class assignment.  Really enjoyed the price and it was an overall good movie.  Shipped quickly and came in perfect condition; including the case.
B00821OX98|5|I heard of this show,but never gave it a second thought.I rarely watch TV anymore.I mostly watch content through the internet.Coming from TV series like Fringe,and The Walking Dead.This show has won me over.I came across Falling Skies while searching for something to watch on Amazon Prime.After the first episode i was hooked.The story,the premise of an Earth under siege by alien forces was nothing new of course.It was the everyday struggle of not only fighting the enemy,but fighting the common enemy within ourselves.The old human nature that says look out for number one.That is the true story of this show,in my opinion.People coming together,working out their differences to fight for a common goal.To sum it all up.I never gave this show a chance.I watched all three season over a two day period,and I cant wait for season 4.
B007TBZ63Y|5|Even though this is a book that I'm pretty sure is not supposed to be marketed to my age group ( I'm 28) I love \\"The Heroes Of Olympus\\" book series. I could barely wait for this book too come out! It was so worth it! Completely amazing! Non stop action! I can't believe I have to wait a full year for book 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Omg!!!!!!! I loved all five of the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" books and when  I saw book one on this series \\"  the lost hero\\" I went crazy.  I love the humor and the way he ties modern day things in with ancient Greek and Roman. This is an amazing series for people of all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0067R0APK|4|excellent product. I enjoyed very much.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Enjoying this series. Tatiana Maslany is amazing, as her characters are well-developed and she does a thoroughly convincing job of creating their personalities.
B009UX2YAC|5|i love this game super addicting! Diffrent everytime and you change places so much fun : D Though this game is semi challenging its amazing.
B00000G3PA|5|Everything went very smoothly. No problems. Shipped quick and the price was awesome. The movie is a great flick. Bruce Willis is one great actor. Love the characters in this film.
B00FATEJYE|5|I love this game... ha  it for iPhone now android. Yay! Now for DC vs Marvel! That would be something to see
B0095ZQ36G|4|in all the books about wwii that i have read this is the first one that showed me how much the german air force was suffering and how the allies bombing was so effective ... a good read
B008YZXYY2|5|It almost seems unfair to review this album on its own since, to me, it clearly feels like the beginning of something bigger. Ive never listened to a two-part album where they actually felt like they require their counterpart. For those unaware this is also a concept album telling the story of a man at a crossroads and has to decide to run back to adolescence or move toward adulthood. I have never been a fan of concept albums since every one I have listened to either feels repetitive as it tries to maintain a theme throughout or the vocals become a cross between reading from a book and opera. That being said...THIS IS HOW YOU DO A CONCEPT ALBUM! Corey manages to tell his story while varying the style, theme, and pacing throughout. For those that were underwhelmed by Audio Secrecy (my favorite album of 2010) due to the slower less brutal direction this album should be a nice return to form for you. There are some slower breakdowns in a few spots but the majority of the album is classic hard-hitting Stone Sour. Corey, as always, puts his all into this album. His writing and vocals are phenomenal and continue to show growth and expansion. Jim Root and Josh Rand are the most underrated guitar duo of this generation. Their playing is some of the most unique and complimentary guitar duality in the industry and HoGaB is a fine example of this. Roy Moyerga's playing is top notch once again. His drums really drive and compiment the heavy guitars throughout the album.<br /><br />Gone Sovereign: The album opener and first single is a complete explosion and great way to begin the journey of this story. The guitars have somewhat of an 80's quality to them which is something different for Stone Sour.<br /><br />Absolute Zero: Gone Sovereign's counterpart is a heavy hitter with a great chorus. The heavy riff that drives the song is one of Jim and Josh's best.<br /><br />A Rumor of Skin: This song could easily fit with Stone Sour's first album. Jim and Josh really display their collaboration on this song.<br /><br />The Travelers Pt.1: A nice cooldown from the first three songs. The background music is what stands out for me on this one. Corey and his acoustic take the forefront while string instruments and some light guitar fills add alot of depth.<br /><br />Tired: My favorite song of the album! Again Jim and Josh really shine on this one. The guitar solos are among my favorite in Stone Sour's catalog. Corey's vocals really take control in this song while the lyrics have a very cool feeling of the story's main character speaking first-person to the listener.<br /><br />RU486: The heaviest song on the album. It has a very classic Anthrax feel to it. To me this song has a very subliminal quality to it. The intro, lyrics, and layering of the chorus give a sense that the story's character or even the audience is being \\"activated\\" in likeness of something similar to Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />My Name is Allen: This song is kind of a mix of all of Corey and Jim's styles. Theres moments of classic Stone Sour, moments of newer Audio Secrecy Stone Sour, and even moments of Slipknot when Corey has sections of just speaking in a dark voice. I like this song but the chorus does feel a little ackward to me for some reason.<br /><br />Taciturn: My 2nd favorite on the album. This song is similar to Imperfect (one of my favorite SS songs) from Audio Secrecy as the main two components are Corey's voice and an acousic guitar. It is very simplistic and yet completely satisfying. The chorus really displays Corey's vocal range. My only criticism, which admittedly is nit-picking, is I really would've preferred the song without the heavy guitar driven 3rd act. Perhaps thats my love for Imperfect's skeletal style speaking. That being said this song has one of the best and most unique guitar solos on the album.<br /><br />Influence of a Drowsy God: This song gives the sense that you are building a conclusion...or I guess it would technically be an intermission in this album's case. The bridge and guitar solo are the prominent parts for me in this song. Not to give the impression that I dislike the song but it is probably my least favorite on the album. I do enjoy the song and have yet to skip it while listening to the album but it doesnt have many standout moments to me so far.<br /><br />The Travelers Pt.2: A louder and more guitar driven version of Pt.1. I like the way the two halves of this song compare and differ from each other, giving the sense that the character is struggling more with his internal conflict.<br /><br />Last of the Real: The most intense song on the album. Corey's vocals are very in-your-face and intense and yet it has a nice hook to the chorus that will keep you coming back. Where most albums tend to save a more mellow or cooled down song to leave the listener walking away on...not the case here. The album closes with a feeling similar to a great tv cliffhanger...leaving you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Luckily we only have a few months to wait until Stone Sour gives us our conclusion.<br /><br />Stone Sour is my favorite band so I may be biased but this album gives me alot of hope that, paired with the concluding half, House of Gold and Bones Part 1 will be a groundbreaking career-defining album for Stone Sour. Putting the music aside for a second, the design of the album packaging that allows the two albums to interlock and create an actual house is pure genius!

B002XHN776|5|I've seen a lot of confusion about what this album means - who are we going to war with?    Take it in what sense thou wilt, and know that I am just about as cynical as they come.  And after watching my civilization driven to near-collapse over the past couple of years, it seems a dark cloud has been hanging over everything.  It's hard to feel good anymore, to feel like anything you do matters, which feeds a vicious cycle of negative thought.    This album says, unequivocally, throw that away, forcefully.  Take those feelings and kick them in the face.  Reject!  Refuse!  This is not what humanity was made for.  Take that latent power inside of you, break free of this horrible, dark shell, and remake the world.
B00NUPTUHG|4|There is no denying that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross can effectively build a score that resonates deep within the listener. Their scores are a fantastic example of music working with the image, and with Fincher they have become a pretty powerful trio of storytellers. Gone Girl is by far their best score to date. As much as I loved The Social Network, it shouldn’t have won the Oscar. Also, The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo was very absorbing but had some structural problems (in that it was a giant blob of score). With Gone Girl it really seems like they nailed the perfectly structured and stylized life unspooled that Fincher was going for.<br /><br />Gone Girl is that perfect twisty thriller score that utilizes Reznor’s and Ross’ sonic textures to paint this gentle picture of marriage. That gentle picture starts to deteriorate as the plot moves along. As new information is revealed, the score sort of reflects the interior breakdown of the characters whose lives are slowly coming unspooled. What makes a Reznor/Ross score unique are of course the synth textures they come up with. They were able to craft some pretty unique stretches of score that build rhythms to set up certain tones. In fact, the score can be pretty manipulative at times in very subtle ways. I found myself attaching to certain characters only to turn on them when an incriminating plot point was revealed. The score played a big part on the ride that I was going on, and it is indeed a ride. This film is just an expertly crafted entertainer, nothing more. Part crime drama, part modern noir mystery, part old-fashioned thriller. Gone Girl gives us lots to sink our teeth into both visually and musically. Fincher’s vision certainly brings out something unique from Reznor/Ross.<br /><br />Gone Girl works at a certain level to really dig itself under your skin in a slow and methodical fashion. The score is probably their most structured work to date as it paints quite a graspable narrative even though their process is not to always score to picture. This idea of a perfect marriage being a facade to a deeply disturbing inner turmoil allowed the score to be exactly that. In Reznor’s own words he wanted to create a sense of “rot” from within. The music effectively does all of this, especially when you see it with the film. Again, a Reznor/Ross score will probably never be a wholly pleasant standalone listening experience. So if you’re looking for an album to jam out to in the car, look elsewhere as scores should never be assessed for that quality. If you want to hear a supremely effective and stylized thriller that consumes you, then jump right in.<br /><br />Kaya Savas for filmmusicmedia.comir process is not to always score to picture.

I can say with 100% certainty that the descriptions of the parents & politics at the school in the book are right on to what I have experienced at both the private and public schools where my daughter has attended.  I look forward to exploring other books by the same author.

B00IKZX1ZI|5|Clear graphics, relaxing background music, cute characters.It's a lot of fun even if you've never seen the movie, works a lot like bejeweled and the extra power-ups they offer are fun but not necessary for game play. so far i haven't found any downsides to it.

B0029LCJJS|5|Amazing acting - excellent show
B00VFTCGES|2|Woof. Talk about all the characters making unbelievable decisions throughout and having unbelievable reactions. This makes the movie itself unbelievable, and thus, not particularly enjoyable for me.
B0000025T6|5|Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\" was one of his least successful albums commercially, to date having sold, I believe, fewer than a million  copies.<br /><br />Among his fans, however, this CD is regarded with a kind of reverent awe:  it is unquestionably Springsteen's best work, exploring dark, introspective themes that he had never visited before, and has not since.<br /><br />It's just unbelievable.  I'm not really such a big fan of \\"The Boss,\\" either.  But this CD has a coherence, grace, and power that defy description.<br /><br />The lyrics will have you slitting your wrists, though.

B000000OUE|5|White Zombie generated some of the most creative metal of the late eighties/early ninties. Some songs still get alot of radio play from this album (ex. 'More Human Than Human). RobZombies voice is at its peak here, nice and rough, demonic and verfy edgy. Alot of the classic Zombie 'Yeah's' are here as well. The guitar playing is excellent. Effects galore, and the actual sound of the guitar is nice and beefy and heavily layered on. The drums are nice, and franticly paced at times (which is good, not bad). The bass is great, nice and loud. This is one of the few metal bands i like to blare with alot of bass. All of the songs on here are great, no fillers - but highlights include 'Electric Head Pt. 1', 'Grease Paint and Monkey Brains', 'More Human Than Human' and 'I, Zombie'. The lyrical content, while outrageous to some, is very creative and outrageously funny! This is great music to get people jumping around and get the adreneling pumping. Once again, this is very creative music in an era where the Nu-Metal scene (1995) began, and the 'real' metal bands were dying about a bit. (good thing metal re-generated itself). This is a great CD and is worth every cent of admission, go get this CD now. It is better than Rob Zombies' solo stuff, i think. The guitar and instrument arrangements are heavier and more complex. Still, this is an awesome CD! Go get it! Kudos to Rob and Co. !
B0002KVULG|4|I'm surprised this film isn't better known - it deserves more attention.    The film is very well-made, the performances, in particular Kate Nelligan and Frank Langella, are perfect, and it's a stunning film in every way.    I think this is what they were trying to do with Lugosi, but this film succeeds!  It just captures all the eroticism and excitement of the story.
1451673442|5|I choose my rating because i am satisfied with the book. I anticipated this book being similar to the secret or the power, but it was not. The book did resort to some of the stories or practices. I liked that the book gave instructions on how to bring about the magic back into our lives.

0425252868|5|The author provided a surprise in the writing of this book.  As an avid reader of WWII history/memoirs, I was pleased at the steps taken in presenting a remarkable story of courage and integrity on the part of an 'enemy' pilot.  Take the time to read this book, it will definitely move you.
B00DR0PDNE|2|well the idea of this item is cool.  I have Hulu and Netflix streaming now.  I was really hoping to use this on my IPAD which is not currently suported.  It does work and it is nice to use on my laptop.  But realistically it is not that great of a device.  I know they say Ipad use coming soon.  But the item is ok and we do use some..<br /><br />We might use more if we did not already have a roku device.  But overall it is cool. But still some kinks to work out!!
B000I186FW|5|It will make you think, it will make you wonder. Definitely on the favorite list of must see movies. AAA
B00B2JSRAS|5|This is the kind of book you'll want to read straight through, but if you really want to test it out -- don't. Take the time to do each little experiment as you go to really get the maximum benefit. I found this book to be an easy read, engaging, funny and not bogged down in a lot of technical double speak that can make some books of this type so confusing. The experiments are easy to do -- some quicker than others. There was at least one that I had to do over after I figured out why it didn't work the way it said it would. Once I got it straight it did, like all the other experiments -- WORK! If you're a skeptic, all the better. when I did the first experiment, which takes 48 hours, I was right down to the last minutes with no dice. I had just said to myself -- oh well -- so much for that -- when not only did I get what the experiment promised, I got it like a ton of bricks. I tend to be a little obtuse and wondered whether I'd even recognize the outcome if it happened, but there was no chance of missing it. None at all. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is wondering what's &#34;out there&#34; and whether we can use it to create positive change in our day to day lives. It's a good read for anyone who comes from a background that demands proof instead of fluff.This book turns that old saying &#34;seeing is believing&#34; on its head and shows that it really should be &#34;Believing is seeing.&#34; Happy reading and  may the Force be with you!

B000E1NWGO|3|Can you ever refer to Rubinstein as an amateur pianist? I have used his Chopin as a reference for the longest time to this day, but had never heard his rendition of these sonatas. I don't know where the root of his problematic execution on this CD comes from other than speculate that he didn't \\"feel\\" the pieces. Another reason, I dare venture, is that he didn't prepare and assimilate them properly. Some artists need to \\"mature\\" before they immerse themselves into, say, Bach. The best example is the third movement of the \\"Moonlight\\" sonata where is more notorious how the right and left hand seem to have been recorded at different times.
B000002LIM|5|I went and saw this movie when I was a kid and I loved it so much. I watched it at home so much on vhs that the sound didn't work but I knew everyline in the movie anyway so it didn't matter much, but the music wasn't there and it just wasn't the same. I bought the soundtrack and fell in love with Danny Elfman's music. It was the first soundtrack I ever bought and it is still my favorite one. Tim Burton and Danny Elafman make the best do o in the movie business. I would recomend anything by Danny Elfman. Any Batman music by him is great just not batman forever or Batman and Robin that was composed by a different composer and it's just not the same.
B009ZRY0IC|5|&#34;Every Kingdom&#34; is sublime.<br />Beautifully written lyrics, amazing instrumentals.<br /><br />Nothing hits me quite like this album.<br /><br />Definitely go for the album with additional tracks. Beyond worth it.

B00005JPLW|5|The 2006 historical action/drama film \\"300\\", directed by Zack Snyder, is based upon an 88-page graphic novel of the same name written by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley that was released in 1999 by Dark Horse.  The story is based upon an actual historical battle that occurred in 480 B.C.E. when massive forces of the Persian Empire under King Xerxes I (played by Rodrigo Santoro) attempted to conquer Greece, but an alliance of Greek city-states, including Sparta, fought the invading forces.  The book \\"300\\" and the film focused on one particular battle of the war: the Battle of Thermopylae, which was a very heroic last-stand battle between 300 highly-trained Spartan warriors accompanied by 700 Thespian volunteers against hundreds of thousands of Persian soldiers.  The vastly outnumbered Greeks, under the leadership of King Leonidas of Sparta (played by Gerard Butler), managed to hold back the overwhelming Persian forces for three days by fighting them in a narrow corridor situated between a high cliff and the Aegean Sea, having better armor and superior fighting skills.    With amazing computer-generated special effects, wonderful acting, a great dialog & plot, as well as very engaging characters, \\"300\\" is an amazing, albeit violent, film.  To preserver the look and feel of the original graphic novel, practically the entire film was shot against blue-screen to precisely recreate the original artwork.  Hence, colors tend to lean towards the red & green with very little blue.  Also, some highly imaginative creatures were created to add a bit of mythology to the film.  Some of what was shown as far as what the Greeks & Persians had for clothing, weaponry & defensive shields was accurate (especially the wicker-shields used by the Persians); but the rest of the Persians' attire was highly stylized for the film.    Superb performances were done by Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas), Lena Headey (as Queen Gorgo), Dominic West (as Theron), David Wenham (as Dilios), Vincent Regan (as the Captain) and Rodrigo Santoro (as Xerxes), as well as Eli Snyder and Tyler Max Neitzel who each played Leonidas when he was a boy in training.  Overall, my rating for the 2006 film \\"300\\" is 5 out of 5 stars and is highly recommended.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I confess. The suspense in The Girl on the Train got so far under my skin that I couldn’t stop until I’d read the book all the way through to the end, costing myself hours of sleep. With as much as I read, this doesn’t happen very often, even with the most skillfully written thrillers.<br /><br />So there’s plenty of suspense here — but not a whole lot more. The Girl on the Train was heavily marketed as the successor to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, an amazingly well crafted thriller that has been on or near the top of national bestseller lists for a very long time. This one doesn’t measure up to that (admittedly) high and possibly unattainable standard.<br /><br />This is essentially the story of three young women, told in alternating chapters from the perspective of each of the three: Rachel, a divorcee; Anna, who is married to Rachel’s ex-husband; and Megan, who lives with her own husband. Megan and Anna’s homes — the latter was Rachel’s home not long before — are situated along the tracks of the train that Rachel takes every day to and from work. Prone to fantasizing, Rachel builds an elaborate story around her daily glimpses of Megan and her husband, neither of whom she has met. The plot unfolds as the women’s stories intersect — and, you guessed it, it’s not a pretty tale.<br /><br />If there’s a message in The Girl on the Train, it may be summed up in a single sentence by the author: “I have never understood how people can disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”<br /><br />Oh, and there’s another message to take from this book: beware of marketers who hype new books as “a worthy successor to [fill-in-the-blank].

0787100277|1|Since the book was given to me as a gift, and the giver was so taken by the novel, I was compelled to read it.  Upon being asked by my friend what I though of it, I struggled to be as gentle as possible.  She was one of  those who had been moved to tears having read the book.  I to was brought  to tears as I read the book, knowing I had to continue to struggle through  the most poorly written book I have ever read.  Summoning up my compasion I  told her that it must have some merit, since it moved her in such a way,  but that I felt nothing (to myself thinking, what a load of pathetic  dribble). I recommended that if she wanted to read authours who portray,  passion, romance, and can develope real characters, in real places, with an  ability to move the reader, she could pick anyone of a number of authours;  such as Hemmingway, Maugham, etc. These authors know how to write bold  moving stories. Waller's attempt at writing inspiring passion only succeed  in pointing out what good books are all about, by comparison to a very bad  one.
1439127700|5|Only 43 men have served as president in our more than two centuries under the Constitution.  It is one of the world's most exclusive clubs, and only those who have served in the office know just how challenging the job is.  In \\"The Presidents Club,\\" authors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy examine the relationships of presidents with their predecessors going back to the mid-20th century.<br /><br />The authors show how ex-presidents come to empathize with their successors, regardless of party, due to the demands of the job--in the words of George H.W. Bush, \\"No matter the politics, you know and understand the weight of the decisions the other guy had to make, and you respect that.\\"  After presidents are in office, they learn quickly how much they are constrained by the decisions made by their predecessors; Jimmy Carter relates that not only was he constrained daily not only by Gerald Ford's decisions, but also by decisions made by Harry Truman decades earlier.<br /><br />Going back to the relationship between Truman and Herbert Hoover, this volume describes relationships that presidents from different parties and presidents from the same party have had with each other and how they worked on issues facing the country.  Presidents reached out for their predecessors most often in matters of foreign policy, and the book discusses how chief executives worked together during events such as the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam, as well as situations involving the Middle East.<br /><br />As time passes, presidents long out of office in some cases view members of the club differently, leading to surprising friendships, such as those between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and between Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton.  Many of the stories recounted in the book will be familiar to political junkies, but there are untold others that you have likely never heard, making \\"The Presidents Club\\" a rewarding read for anyone with a strong interest in politics or the presidency.

B000A7DVY0|5|The Big Lebowski is to my generation what The Rocky Horror Picture Show is to my parent's. While I haven't seen anybody acting out the Big Lebowski on stage while the movie plays behind I have been to midnight screenings complete with people dressed up as characters from the movie. That being said this movie is one of the classic you like and get or you don't. It seems that most female don't appreciate this movie as much as guys do (but I do know several women that do enjoy it).    The Big Lebowski takes place in Hollywood right before Operation Desert Storm. If there is a plot in this movie it would be the 'hero' Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is trying to replace his rug. You see the rug really tied his living room together. And some Chinaman peed on his rug. As the movie progresses we learn that The Dude was confused for a different Jeff Lebowski, who is not only a millionaire but married to a trophy wife who owes money all over town, and that the Chinaman meant to pee on the millionaire's rug. The Dude and his two friends; the hilariously bitter Vietnam Vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), and the soft spoken, strike rolling, Donny (Steve Buscemi) are thrown into a complicated kidnapping scheme involving Nihilists, 15 year old car thieves, porn kings, a feminist artists, and the Chief of Police of Malibu.     From crazy dreams to garden parties this movie is as good the 10th time as it is the 1st time you see. While this movie is hilariously funny, and incredibly quotable it must be noted that there is a lot of 'foul' language so make sure you watch it before you decide to let any impressionable children see it.

Acceptable terms then that are completely inappropriate today, gives you an additional understanding of many strides humanity has taken.... Fun book, great look at history. I would encourage any mystery lover to purchase.

630575067X|2|This first of three prequels to the Star Wars trilogy is big on special effects (indeed it deserved to win an Oscar in this category but had to make do with noms for Visual Effects, Sound and Sound Effects) but mediocre  in terms of any human qualities, story interest or humor.  It's dreadfully  serious and uninvolving and rather formulaic - geared more for children  than for adults.  Not as deserving as the trilogy itself. For Star Wars  groupies only.

This is my first mouse with programmable buttons and I only really have one complaint, the buttons on the side of the mouse (particularly the one farthest from your palm) can be a stretch to reach. Other than that I have been very happy with the mouse.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this as a first \\"gaming\\" mouse, and I have been very impressed with the company behind it.  Anker has emailed me twice regarding the order to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  Now if only they made a mechanical keyboard with a couple programmable keys they would have another sale. :)

B003XG831Q|5|Here you have a special Nordstrom's two-for-one issue of the first \\"Bossa Nova\\" record in the USA, Jazz Samba -- paired with the immortal Getz/Gilberto recording.<br /><br />JAZZ SAMBA.  Recorded in two days in a Washington, D.C.church by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz.  They had created the first wonderful HIT, \\"Desafinado\\", from the recording.  Since these two were more or less \\"winging it\\" there is a wonderful spontaneous feel to their music.  Came out in 1960 and caught the \\"gringos\\" with their pants down (if you pardon the expression.)  \\"Desafindo\\" was a major HIT and stayed at the top of the charts for, I don't know, something like 24 weeks.  (At this point in time, no one, more or less had heard of Joao Gilberto, the father of Bossa Nova.)  Actually, Charlie Byrd and his boys were on a \\"good will\\" trip to Brazil and Charlie heard, liked and bought several Joao Gilberto LP's.  (Remember them?)  Then he played them for Getz and Verve producer Grantz.  And JAZZ SAMBA was born.  (What else could they call it?)<br /><br />GETZ/GILBERTO.  Recorded in the fall of 1963 but not released until Summer 1964 (when they hoped the Bossa Nova \\"FAD\\" had ended and their might be room for the REAL THING.)  Remember the \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" (or \\"gal\\" as Astrud Gilberto sings.)  The entire recording with Joao, his then wife, Astrud, Getz, Antonio Carlos Jobim (the composer of many of the songs) and an imported brazilian drummer, Milton Banana -- (real name) who was brought up to the USA to add authenticity.  Which he certainly did!  This is a world class album that will still be bought and listened to ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM TODAY!  And I am not kidding!  If you have not heard it (is there anyone who has not?)-- buy it!  Listen to Joao, Astrud, Stan, \\"Tom\\", and Milton and a bassist (whom I forget.)  Then you will have experienced Heaven on earth.  (Personal note:  unfortunately Stan Getz, and Antonio (\\"Tom\\") Carlos Jobim have both died.<br /><br />And just think, when everyone professionally associated with this Getz/Gilberto wonder is no longer here -- WE CAN STILL LISTEN TO THEM CREATING SOME MOST EXQUISITE MUSIC!  And they will all be ALIVE AGAIN!
B006GWO5NE|5|This item is shipped quickly...it serves it's purpose.
B00AW735QC|5|I was really taken in by the writers abilities to combine both horror and a sense of fun with the \\"Name Game\\". The wild twist and turns to the story line really keep me coming back for more and the acting is just wonderful. It is as if the actors and writers had a canvas and are at liberty to be creative. I never know what will come next. A job well done to everyone.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|Awesome
0307962520|3|The book it's ok, nothing new in it. Love Ann Rice , I just wish there were  more New characters and  plots. She  still an excellent writer.
B00003CXWV|5|First and foremost, the dvd extra's such as the interview with George Jung, Ted Demme and George Jung discussing the movie, and commentating was excellent. The music/vocals by Nikki Costa creates a very sombering moment and when viewing the last moments of the film it makes you even sadder for George Jung. Johnny Depp did an excellent job of bring this character to life and I have to admit that I felt sorry for him in the end. The thing that I admired about George was his sense of independnce and freedom, even though it came at a cost due to personal choices. I think most people begin to care for George when his daughter arrives and that changes your opinion about him slightly. Regardless this film was fantastic and would be a great addition to anyone's personal library.
0887431453|5|My 3-yr old great-granddaughter loved it. It kept her attention for longer than most things would. Are there not more like it?
B00I2TV3NO|5|good movie
B009GEON22|4|Does a very good job bringing the graphic novel to life. Fans of the graphic novel will enjoy watching it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4|Although i am not as impressed as most people about this show, i have enjoyed it and will continue to watch.
B003VANOFY|1|The plastic covers that go over the pivot point of the ear cups will break. Had mine for about a year and it just now broke. You can try to glue it back in place or tape it but nothing worked for me. Great headphone if it wasn't for the fact that it will break at some point after regular use.
B000F4LPJ6|1|After reading the Hunger Games by Collins, I felt empty and unsatisfied.  I then signed onto Amazon and reviewed some of the reviews on her book and realized that I wasn't alone.  I found that her ideas for her book assumingly came from another book, which was Battle Royale.  I had to find out whether it was true, since The Hunger Games read like a bunch of plots tied into one.   It took me 3 days total to read the 600 pages of Battle Royale.  The book was Awesome!  I loved reading it and enjoyed every second.  The story was so well put together and realistic that it had me thinking about highschool and what I would do if I were in that situation.  However, after getting into 20 minutes of the movie, I was disgusted.  I couldn't beleive that the Director took a already perfectly set plot and distorted it to make no sense.    Then I saw that so many people commented positvely on the movie and thought that it might actually be as good as the book or better.  Total opposite!  The movie was horrible.  Actually it was ridiculous, considering that the book provided a perfect premise.  I can only say that I am glad that I read the book first, or I would have never known how good it was based on the movie.  The Hunger Games were a total sham.  After reading the first book, which took me 3 weeks to read all 300 plus pages, I decided not to read another.  After reading Battle Royale, I can see why so many people accused Collins of stealing the idea from Battle Royale (the novel).  If you don't beleive me, read the novel.  Don't give the movie a second thought, you will be dissappointed!
B00003CXS4|5|I really don't care that Guy Ritchie is married to Madonna. It hasn't affected his moviemaking talent. I loved Lock, Stock; I loved Snatch. It's hilarious, scary, splendidly edited and, best of all, features Brad Pitt in, arguably, the best performance of his career. Every time I start to wonder about why (aside from his looks) he has a career at all, I'm reminded that, to me, he was the only redeeming feature in Thelma and Louise. In Snatch he is perfection: the incomprehensible dead-on Irish blather, the banty-rooster fighting fists, the mother-loving sentiment; the entire package is just fabulous. Don't miss this one, even if you have to rewind a lot to figure out what people are saying (sometimes they're not actually saying anything!) just go with it. It's a completely unpredictable, very very funny ride (with some genuinely frightening moments). Not to be missed.
B002HJ9PTO|4|The sound quality of this mic is very good, pics up light buzzing in the background but nothing editing software cant remove. The clip that is suppose to hold the mic onto someone is a joke though, does not attach to the mic at all so you end up having to fashion it to the person yourself. Last thing I would say is there is no directions. Someone buying a mic can look at that statement and say really? Why do you need that but for a beginner it can be annoying opening this up and finding nothing.<br /><br />While there is some negatives for the price this is a great mic and for interviews does a excellent job. Would definitely recommend if you are about to do an interview and need a cost effective mic.
B00I2WNYJW|5|The book should be read by every legislator in every country in the world. It is too long and somewhat repetitive but many legislators need to read it repeatedly to get it right.
B00013M6NK|5|Ordered [2] of these because the price was too hard to beat. Both took full charge and we'll see how they perform. At this point I am very satisfied with my purchase. Shipping took a little longer than I expected but it was not an immediate need so no complaints so far.
0784011796|5|The only way to be able to judge this movie is by watching it several times, because there is so much there that it is impossible to absorb it all the first time.<br />Spirals are everywhere, whether they be hurricanes, or subatomic particle paths, or galaxies, and come in many forms. The belief of the main character(indeed, probably the only thing resembling a religious belief for him) is that all nature is defined by mathematics, by patterns, and that it is only a matter of finding the right pattern, and he begins to find himself surrounded by logarithmic spirals, and in some very unexpected ways.  <br />Forget about trying to say what this story is about, because the movie is about EVERYTHING; it is layered, intertwined and complex, but its messages can be interpreted so simply, it indeed deserves such a simple title.<br />Think about this: after having watched the movie, you can see that only Max was able to understand the number because he could see 'between' the numbers; he could see the entire hidden and intricate meaning behind it. Is there a meaning, or a message, behind this movie? Almost certainly, but one can only understand it if they can see all the facets of this movie (Max's growing insanity, the stock market, the Torah, consciousness, and so on) and be able to connect them. <br />And that is what I say, with no offense or pretension, to anyone who didn't like this movie. Please see it again. I get more out of it every time.
B00000JCRH|5|This album had, and still has, a very pronounced impact on the metal  genre.  I've been a hardcore Metallica fan since it's release in '86 and  it's still my favorite, although I love everything they've done to date.   It's unfortunate that so many so-called fans have bashed and ridiculed the  band for continuing to be musical pioneers and experimenting with new  sounds and textures.  Any true musician will always seek out new territory  as their tastes and skills mature.  These guys are  constantly developing.   I'll admit that I am partial to their older material, but it's hard to  compare that to what they're doing today.  It's totally unique and  different.  I like the contrast! If you're a newer fan, you should  definitely make an effort to check out 'Puppets', and other older albums as  well.  And if you can catch 'em in concert, DO IT!!  I've seen them six  times and have yet to be disappointed!
B009FZHYKU|5|This is a great episode I love the whole seires and season three is the best so far!!  I Can't wait for season four to start in October!!!
B000FC2PKG|1|aka: Alone: A Detective Bobby Dodge Novel.  To quote Yogi Berra when quizzed about the attendance at one of his baseball games,  \\"They stayed away in droves!\\" This is what should happen with this book. I found the plot to be coarse and contrived and the characters with no redeeming value and thoroughly unlikable. There was also no relief for the reader. In advertising, you learn to leave some \\"white space\\" so the eye can rest and focus on the primary target of the ad. This book had so many targets being killed, for no discernable reason, it felt like the characters were in an exploding ammunition factory, instead of a well developed plot.  Even the characters couldn't keep up with who had been killed and why. Instead of trying to determine what was happening, they fell victim to the \\"Blame it on Bobby Flu\\", led by his good (?) friend Typhoid Mary. Oh, I meant Detective D.D. Warren. I had to put the book down several times because it was confusing, depressing and unbelievable.<br /><br />I would like to add the characterizations as the one redeeming quality...but I can't. Even D.D comes off as a tough blonde Bimbo who runs around in stilettos and leather and can't figure her way out of a bag. The only traits missed in D.D.'s characterization were the chewing gum and nail file. Am I reading Janet Evonovitch?!<br /><br />I have enjoyed many of this author's books and will read her again. This one was a miss for me.
B009JZWO3I|5|This series continues to present new twists and turns in the life of Alecia Floreck and the supporting cast. Always look forward to the next episode.
B00QL0ST1K|5|Love the game the very best football game ever created
B00CWVFPGO|3|It entertains. Predictable, but still enjoyed the comedy aspects.
B002GKQ5MY|5|Great group of talented ladies!! Subject matter will help many..
B00005R87Q|5|THe fast and the Furious has gotten many bad reviews. i dont agree with any of them. for what the movie is trying to say, it did the job very well. An undercover cop tries to disrupt a band of hijackings that are done by a suspected group of street racers. i ownt give away the ending, but all of the race scenes are excellent. the portrayal of teh racing scene is accurate, i would know being a part of it. also, the cars are some of the best imports on the scene. i would reccomend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun ride.
B0006Z2KYI|5|A forgotten classic.  Glad to see this finally on DVD!
B00V4JKT52|1|Awful.  And the Johnny Depp song was extremely creepy.
B00DF0ZP8Y|5|thanks
B00N35P5MW|4|Great game to keep your mind focused. ...think of this as exercise for your brain.  Colorful patterns, simple concept.
B00EMXBDMA|4|A great read if not great literature. Clearly it will be a movie, I hope which is worthy of the book.
B007JRU2UK|5|Loved this movie offered on Amazon<br /><br />Good value and quick download for viewing<br /><br />Looking forward to a larger selection of movies on Amazon
B004I11VZ0|5|love it
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I love this game it's just like flappy bird but better it has different colors for the bird and the pipes!
B004SBQGHS|1|how do people think this is fun all you do is slingshot a bird and try to get the pig. so unaddictive<br />stupid rip off
B007R11DKQ|5|really great!
B00AZVAE1E|5|I think I've watched every episode of this series and have found it to be entertaining and I love the characters. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the updated Sherlock Holmes and Watson but Lucy Liu is wonderful and Jonny Lee Miller is fabulous as the modern day Sherlock Holmes. As another reviewer stated I am SO SICK of so-called \\"reality\\" tv shows it's refreshing to find television can still be well written and acted and fun to watch!
B007IXWL2C|5|This is a great series. Well written and captive. I love how the series was wrapped up. Best ending ever!
B00992CF6W|5|Awesome minecraft togo, this is a fun way to waste your time. Its not the full minecraft game like you the pc.  But it does give the basic things that make minecraft fun and with updates every now and again it just get better and better.  You can get it free by using this link [...]
B0013TXA5Y|5|So many plot twists a lot of surprises definitely kept me on the edge of my seat can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B00HZ3C4N6|4|Decent acting and good story line. Worth watching.
0385751060|3|I just finished reading this book with my children (age 10 and 13). The book is important and reasonably well-written. It provides a good medium for discussing the Holocaust with kids, but I think it has some disturbing flaws.  <br /> <br />Bruno, the main character, is only 9, and he has an innocence that is taken too far. I think that if I was Jewish, I would be offended by the idea that this boy's parents were so involved in the evil that was the Auschwitz, and somehow not spewing hateful, anti-semetic rhetoric in their daily lives. Somehow this boy, despite a year of friendship with a little boy in the concnetration camp, just never made the leap of understanding that he was living in a family of people who were perpetrating hatred.  <br /> <br />His father is a Commandant, and to truly talk to our children about the Holocaust, I believe it is important to explain to them how hateful the fuhrer and his soldiers were. No child could be raised under the tutelage of such a high-ranking soldier, and not be aware of the hate and the brutality that lived within his home. He may have been raised to admire it, but he could never have been oblivious. Not even at age 9. Children are far more perceptive than adults, and could never maintain this hopelessly self-absorbed innocence for more that a year. It just went too far. <br /> <br />I also think that although it is brilliant marketing by the publisher not to include a summary in the front of the book, it is dangerous and somewhat irresponsible. This is a book that you should read WITH your children...make no mistake that it needs to be discussed and explained. When I read the brief \\"sell\\" on the inside front cover, I could make the leap that it was about the Holocaust, but the references are veiled and confusing, and even though my kids are gifted readers at the top of their respective classes, they would have been confounded, and perhaps even upset by the writing. That's okay, as long as I'm there reading it with them.<br /> <br />I'm sure the purpose of providing a mysterious introduction is to sell more books, and get over the problem of people saying, \\"I don't want to read a book about this depressing subject.' Again, great marketing and probably effective, but misleading and unfair to parents who are trying to pick appropriate subject matter for their kids.
B000FC2L1Y|5|I love the Outlander series.  Diana Gabaldon's writing is fantastic
1449433251|5|This impressive box set is now my &#34;way back machine&#34;. I love the size of the frames, bigger than they ever were in the newspaper. Plus the colors are much more vivid. Reading takes me back to the time I first read calvin in the 80s.  Very nice and would be a great gift for any calvin and hobbes fan.
030746363X|5|I used this book along with the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] to totally transform my body and life.<br /><br />I wanted to shred fat, build muscle, and look like a different person.  I wanted to get more attention from women and be proud of my physical appearance and presence.<br /><br />I picked up the 4-Hour Body and the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] and have learned a ton from  both of them.  Most importantly, I've really followed the advice of both and stuck to it for about 3 months now.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body offers tons on unique perspectives on exercise and overall healthy lifestyle.  Ferriss is a great author who is always making new discoveries and whittling down super-effective techniques to accomplish goals.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] is focused on gaining muscle fast and takes on training, dieting, supplementation, and mindset of transforming your body.  It's the best breakdown of transforming your body fast and getting ripped and jacked that I've seen.  Thanks to it and the 4-Hour Body for helping me change my life.<br /><br />Check it out.  Ferriss always delivers.
B00IYOACQ6|5|Great game. Not impossible but not too easy either. I enjoyed the challenge and I liked that there are a lot of levels.
B000056IKS|3|3 1/2    I can see why this disc is put upon a pedestal. In some ways it is as musically innovative as any of the other Kraut greats. About halfways. The other half remains predictable or indulgently vacant, exemplified by the life-sucking conclusion (though not the peaceful fadeout).
B0094MAZKK|4|There will never be a shortage of thighs to be stabbed...<br /><br />Ultra-violence at its best, but with that said it can be a bit draining if you are not in the right mental state.
B001GMQALY|2|I was thrilled when she finally bailed out on the jerk.  Decided that I don't need to watch movies like that.
B007J4T2G8|2|This book is poorly written and it takes the feminist movement back 50 years. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I could barely finish it.
B0072GPQNG|5|If your a horse person or a person interested in WW1 then this show is for you. Never gets boring ,keeps you on the edge of your seat. Has its sad parts but the ending is well worth it.
B00O0MBJPO|4|I am a Garth fan form the very beginning of his career, but I have to honestly admit that this CD was a bit disappointing for me.<br />It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  I expected more from him after 13 years away. It will probably sell OK but it didn't ring any bells for me. I liked it, but I didn't love it.... like his older music.  I have tickets to his concert in North Little Rock in December so I hope to hear a lot of his old stuff mixed with the new.  I am still a hard core Garth and Trish fan.
B006PHD0RW|5|this game is very fun and addictive. some levels are pretty hard but its fun anyways. you should get it! or atleast get the free version. have fun!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Wonderful and quick read full of emotion. I appreciate the honesty, compassion, and optimism of the book and the characters.
B00FN2KR2G|5|Really enjoyed this book, a lot of twists and turns and a great ending!!  Would  recommend it to all my friends.
0553106635|5|Want this entire series on hardbook..  Love this fantasy  All the readers of our house gobble up the new words from George<br />RR Martin.  A Wonderful world..
B00R2LTNL2|5|I like these movies. With these being a digital copy I can take them with me on vacation on my kindle fire. I can also play them on my PS3 which is handy since I'm running out of room for dvd's.
B00LC93GCC|4|It's graphically appealing, and the gameplay is easy enough to catch onto quickly.
B0031TZ8TU|5|Love love loved the book. It's not only atru story, it's is almost what's happening now around the world. It's a good read!
B0064TVQ5E|1|This game kinda confuses me. I can play it better on my laptop and I still don't really understand the rules completely.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I can watch movies via NetFlix and I can watch you tube.  I never realized how much streaming content is out there.
B0000024SD|5|While I flip-flop on the issue, today I consider this Dylan's finest album.  When I first heard it back in the 70's, I considered the electric side dated and amateurish.  Any pre-Hendrix guitar work was always going to sound behind the times, and it was just too - well, lo-fi!  But the circle has turned, and lo-fi is in again, and this album miraculously sounds better than ever.  The acoustic side, though, is the true miracle, with two of Bob's best-ever songs, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's Alright Ma.\\"  If you've only heard the Byrds' version of Tambourine Man, you haven't heard the song.  Nobody but Dylan can write songs that can be tough and tender at the same time, and he never did it better than right here.
B003EYVXXW|1|This film belongs in the Hall of Fame for Worst Movie Ever. It is lovely to look at, but the actors are horrible. The plot idea is good, but the execution fails. The dialog and movement seem really false. It just doesn't seem like a representation of real people of any time period. I tend to love period pieces, but I actually hated this and could not finish it. Horrid.
B00942X8PY|1|You can only go so far in this game before you reach the end and have to upgrade, so I deleted it.
B00KGRFV92|4|story was good, I thought it ended quickly though
B004SJ3AXI|1|its ok
B008JJM88Q|4|It's a nice game but not worth the money and it can be boring can be stupid and fun at the same time 4STAR rating can't give it higher
B00AQLGXTU|5|Read it in like one day. Great twists and further complications of the story.  Hope i don't have to wait a year to See what Happens next...
B007N5YIUS|4|Only thing I don't like is the ads. Once you try space, the original ones are boring. three words required.
B00992CF6W|5|This is one of the best games on kindle fire. It's really fun and I think everyone should have this amazing game. Just make sure you don't die on survival with a lot of items in your inventory.
B008Y7N7JW|4|Not a bad movie at all.  Going to see the next 2....as a result of this first experience.  Ha ha!!
B00992CF6W|5|Fun<br />Such a cool way to share creativity<br />But the need to add stuff like ghasts and stuff like that<br />Wish there was village s so u can have kids<br />Just so fun<br />Fun fun fun
B00HYFGSPU|5|If you like previous work from Damon Albarn give this a listen.  I'm a huge Blur and Gorillaz fan but was skeptical about this release for some reason.  I received it as a xmas gift and have been listening to it straight through quite a bit.  Seems very autobiographic.  Not as cohesive as a Blur or Gorillaz Album but each track is unique and inviting!!
0783225733|5|I love this Movie!
B00FAX6XQC|5|Not a bad game,hunting with out stepping out of your house! Very realistic graphics,works great on the new Kindles another good point it's freee, and remember your not really killing any real animals,it's just for amusement!
B00C8S9W0G|5|She never fails to delight us!  The last page appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, leaving me without my old friends, Claire and Jamie, once again!
B007ZSBQYE|3|Only 3 stars because of the sloshy controls, but I keep going back to try and master the ridiculously impossible situations.  It's annoyinglly fun!
B005Z271Y6|5|She is wonderful, she is fantastic, she is Adele.  Took us by surprise and won all of us over with her emotions. She is TERRIFIC
B00BLCHZC2|5|The Vikings is a super series! Great characters, historical accurate and a fun night to spend with Ragnar and his family!
B00OKYQZDI|5|A lot of fun!!!
B0002S94OS|5|I think it is sad that some people can rate this album lower beacsue they \\"don't love politics.\\"  Lamb of God is one of the only bands who can tell that this country is in the waining stages of a democracy and has the balls to write about it.  If more people could grasp this and maybe particiapate in their own government maybe this country could be rescued from idiot Bush and pulled out of the toilet.  Not to mention the musicality of this album is far superior to most any metal or hardcore or whatever you call it album out there.  Hopefully LoG can continue on this brilliant path.
B00ADQCBEY|4|Great show
B00DPM7TIG|3|This is an extremely well written novel, with an unusual structure. The characters, with their diverse personalities, are very real to the reader. France and Germany are realistically shown before, during and after WWII. The ending of the book was not well thought out, was unrealistic  and disappointing. Because of the ending, I wish I had never read the book. It just fell flat at the end. The care given to the development of the ending was very weak. If only the writer had not given out of steam and given us such a flat ending.
0307596885|5|This book touches my heart.  I am so involved all along the way.  Poo Poo to all the nay sayers!<br />Poetic and soulful.
B008GAXUYE|5|Very impressed with the set.  Well recorded.  Booklet is not of any use apart from an essay for the set.  As always, the set comes without texts of any type.  This seems to be the best recorded set overall of any of this company's box sets.
B0027BOL4G|4|Be warned it's a pretty graphic film about the food industry.  With that said - it's also very informative and could change the way you eat.  I haven't had fast food since I watched it.  The movie was presented well and is easily comprehended.
0307716546|4|An older daughter is working in an elementary school.  The school catches fire and a Mother runs into the burning building to save her girl.  This is the story of the daughter and mother after the fire.  Both are now in the hospital and unconscious, both near death.  No one can hear them but they talk to one another and are aware of everything going on in this soul hovering mystery.<br /><br />Next - you guessed it.  Revelations abound as Mother and Daughter watch those closest to them.  What's more, the fire wasn't accidental but deliberately set to hurt the daughter.  The would be murderer continues to go after the daughter as she lay dying in the hospital.  Neither Mom nor Girl can do a thing but watch as the story unfolds.<br /><br />The \\"who done it\\" portion is brilliantly played.  However the tale surrounding that portion is quite predictable and padded.  Personally I enjoyed the tale.  It wasn't fast paced or clever beyond belief but it was OK.
B002JVWQSW|5|I'm in laugh a minute heaven every time I sit down to watch this show. I can't get over how clever all the scenes  and dialog are.It's even touching at moments without being clawing or syrupy.Everyone I've mentioned the show  to is as enthusiastic about it as I am.Can't believe there's not a dud in any of the episodes. Every actor in it  is amazing and believable, even the kids. The best cast I've ever seen to date.It's sure to win lots of awards in  the future next go round. If I had seen it before Glee finished their season, I would have been pulling for Modern  Family to win. I'm always last to watch something new, and it's the same with Modern Family, the loss is all mine,  and I can't wait till it's available on DVD for me to own my on copy.
0802130208|5|Good book and in the condition promised.
B0050DIWFC|5|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time!  Very intriguing and it certainly keeps your attention!
B009YP9L7U|5|Loved this book so much!!!! I finished it in less than a week and trust me it is worth every second of your time. Probably one of the best books I have read!
B00MNYTWMI|3|This is a fun game, but has a lot of software issues.  It jams and you lose progress.  Sometimes, you lose progress when you just shut it off.  If it weren't for these frustrating issues I would have given it a higher rating.
B00V4JHNZG|4|Edge of your seat excitement fun to watch. Brings the story right back to the Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Rings.
B001AVCFJM|1|The title of the review says it all. This is more mindless, trying too hard to appease the masses, exploding crap that Hollywood continues to pump out. Many people will suck it down, so there probably will be a sequel.
B007R0WHMK|3|I rarely cry when I see a movie, but this one choked me up.  Although the Main character was  not very likeable, the father was.  I identified with his  very strong character.  His love for his daughter and his connection to her was heartfelt. Especially when he fought so desperately to keep her from harm but it was to no avail.
B00HDMMISA|5|Really enjoyed this book. I'm a new fan of this author
B003O86FMW|4|Makes me wish that I could have read the first book before this one. It won't stop me from reading the next book
B00FPOSDGY|5|Amazing. I read it in one weekend because it was SO hard to put down. Read it!
B00OKYQZDI|5|love it
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I wasn't too sure in the first two chapters but soon this book took a hold of me and I could not put it down. Just wonderful.
0312323867|5|This was a great read, and I highly recommend it if you enjoyed Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed\\". This answered the questions and explained the back story of the first book, and in my opinion, was not a 'predictable' story, which made it even better.
B008K9SG9K|5|I loved the song &#34;It's Time&#34; when I heard it during The Perks of Being a Wallflower trailer. Then &#34;Radioactive&#34; came out and I wasn't quite sure that I would like the rest of the album. &#34;Demons&#34; sealed the deal for me. Imagine Dragons is wonderful. I was really pleased with the entire album and can see several other singles coming. &#34;Every night&#34; &#34;Top of the World&#34; These songs get in my head, stay there, and I like it.
B006LSZECO|5|Great book. It was hard to put it down. I will definitely read other books by this author.
B007SGM084|5|I could not put down any of these books, I love the extra stories from different perspectives also. Wouldn't mind reading more of them. Highly recommended!
B004LOMB2Q|5|I've used Evernote for years.  Its cross-platform feature makes it makes it incredibly useful for all areas of my life -- from home to office.  Combined with The Secret Weapon it is dynamite!
0618918248|5|I absolutely loved this book. It was well thought out and written. I was already atheist going into it but his eloquent arguments gave me more conviction to stand up for knowledge and rationality instead of tip toeing around religion in the name of respect.
B0087JTAKW|5|I always enjoy Mitch Albom's books and this one did not dissappoint.  Good premise, and fast read.  I would highly recommend this to any Albom fan,<br />and anyone who likes the idea of thinking about the value of time in our society.
0375826742|5|This is only the second book on the 5 that are the Inheritance cycle and the whole work is amazing, just a must read for any one who enjoys fantasy stories
B00992CF6W|5|This app is out of this world you can do all shorts of stuff you can make a big house I made a tall house that goes up to the sky and you can make mosters so if you like this stuff then this is the app for you
B0012DT9VK|5|I like this movie. It is a silly movie.
B0015AARJI|2|Stopped working shortly after i received it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3|extremely laggy since big update. ive been booted off loads of times. after getting booted I come back to see the game didn't register the last few minutes. so I end up losing items. its even lamer when I'm touching things in my chests and I Dc. I lose lots of stuff. fun. but the new update needs to be fix-either that or my kindle fire and kindle fire hd cant play this. :(
B00HDMMISA|5|This one is really good, people. I read it in 2 sittings. I could not stop reading it. I had to know what was next, what was next, WHAT WAS NEXT!?!? Although I correctly guessed a few of the plot points it did not diminish my enthrallment as the story unfolded. I think what sets Liane Moriarty's writing apart and makes it superior to other books of this genre is that she takes the time to create three dimensional characters. It's not just cardboard cut out characters--the characters are distinct from one another and you end up loving and/or hating them. The details of family life, raising children, elementary school parent politics are almost eerily dead on. You should totally read this you guys!
B00003Q438|5|This is probably my favorite DVD. I'm a long time fan of the movie and this edition makes it even better with all the extra features. A must-have for any s.f. buff.
B004DF3S7A|4|good
B004BRQYJ4|5|It is music I like what is with this required number of words non sense - if I did not like it I wouldn't have bought it
B0091REZMW|4|I like this game. The progression of levels goes smoothly and the controls are easy to use for any type of electronic device you want to download it unto.
B00ECW9UJY|5|I REMEMBER SEEING THIS MOVIE A WHILE BACK AND IT IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN ON ALIEN ABDUCTION..........IT IS A MUST SEE!!!  YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT AND THE ACTING WAS TOP NOTCH!!!!!!!!!!  THANK YOU, AMAZON FOR HAVING THIS MOVIE ON DVD:))))))
B00IIU9U00|5|What can I say.  Leo and a fabulous cast, great script, great direction.
B004DI7HZ6|5|When my neice suggested this read I was thinking,&#34; This will be a while&#34;.  To my great surprise I couldn't put it down.  I am recomending this book to all of my reading family.
B005544TRQ|5|After watching the pilot, I basically spent the next 24 hours streaming the remainder of the series. I love the banter between the various characters and it almost makes me want to go to law school myself.
B0057RCFQS|5|Great buy. Received the DVD's is great time. No problem with vendor. The experience was good. Jurasic Park is one of my favorite movies, all three of them.
1606863622|5|This was my first Nicholas Sparks novel and I think it was a great first book!!  I am so glad I read the book before I saw the movie.  The book includes so much more depth and detail than the movie does, which is typical.  This book kept me engaged from the very beginning and always wanting to read more.
B001U3Y5XE|5|I heard from the parents that they as a family , just love the game.  The kids ask their parents to play it with them every night.
1607747308|5|Great book. Good ideas. It's helpful to me.
B002KREVE2|5|I am surprised it took so long for this to come on the market (39 years after the fact?)  This is a MUST for every Leonard Cohen fan to have.  It shows him in the early stages of his career …long before he evolved into the more slick persona of  his later years.  This is when he still played guitar on all his songs (he was a brilliant and classically trained &#34;folk&#34; guitarist…unlike anyone else in the business)  His band for this show was fantastic…so tight and well rehearsed, belying the somewhat ragged and hippie look that they presented.  I was spell bound throughout the entire DVD.
B00DMCV7K0|5|This is well written, well referenced and educational. In a time when 12 years a slave is winning awards, this novel continues the work of demonstrating the horrors of slavery for both owners and slaves, and shows how good came from it. The work of both sisters is historic.
B0063GORYU|5|My sister got me hooked. Now I play on my computer and my kindle.  I can play and watch a movie. Love it!
1451666179|5|i follow Allie's blog so this was a given to buy the book...all the fun stories from her blog and more awesome revelations in a bright big book. for amazing life insights and hilarity on top,,i recommend this book highly.
096798467X|5|This book covers plans for building an earth oven and using it.  The ideas can be put into anyone's yard, with the good descriptions, along with the materials to use.  Plus the recipes and ideas for baking in it gives this book an A plus!
0399226907|5|This is a great bedtime book and a good way to get my son to count. Very good for interactive story time.
1401923127|5|I think this is a must read.  The book outlines rather clearly and with simplicity the great degree to which we can have an effect on our physical bodies.  And it's not the author's opinions.  Hard scientific evidence is sited and easily translated.
B00N1HONIO|2|Just wasn't for me.
B003H90ENE|5|RECEIVED IN GREAT CONDITION.  VERY EASY TO INSTALL.  WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.  MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING IT FROM AN OFFICE SUPPLY STORE!
B0050VA428|5|Wonderful, my most favorite book of all time. One that I have read many times. May be the perfect mystery.
B0096PAA6E|5|I bought this based on many great reviews (professional and word of mouth from friends). This album is a MUST buy! I noticed lots of influence from other artists in Mr. Clark's music--Lenny Kravitz, Hendrix, the Stylistics, etc. I really enjoyed it and suggested those close to me to buy it!
0783219695|3|Apollo 13 is a good Ron Howard film, I just don't think it's his most accomplished work. Tom Hanks pulls off another excellent performance, the problem I have with this film is the pacing, it's slow but the ending more than makes up for it. Apollo 13 is a film every young adult should watch, good history lesson.
B0000AZJXQ|5|Maynard had a lot more influence on this album over their previous release (most of the songs were written before he joined the band). For a huge Tool fan such as myself this is a great thing. The energy swings around, building to crescendos and coming down with a crash in classic Tool style, while maintaining A Perfect Circle's unique and more subdued sound. There is greater variance between songs and more creative orchestration.<BR>For me the real magic of this album begins at track 9 with 'The Nurse That Loved Me' and 'Pet'. It will be interesting to see how that evolves with more listening.<BR>Although I will keep my preference for Tool, this album makes a good alternative when I need something less offensive (i.e. parents around for dinner!)
B001PU8N0I|5|I just started watching last evening and finished the first 4 episodes.  It is very interesting and comical, the English sure have a flair when it comes to producing series or movies!! nothing like it. I am looking forward to watching another 4 episodes this afternoon. I highly recommend Little Dorrit.
B0004Z33EQ|3|Recently I watched this movie, it was fun but filmwise \\"DUMB\\". Come on why would anyone love seeing action and explosions instead of \\"PLOT\\" and \\"CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\\" like in the amazing First Blood before it.
B00J4S4EWO|5|our granddaughters loved it
B0060MYM7O|4|We watched the series initially streaming and the beauty of the art direction is kind of lost in the online compression. With the blu-ray all of the gorgeiousness sings!
B003XMWSSY|5|how marvelous to find an expert in the subject like mr Lukeman in this case, and open to share his expertise with us!! the examples of every case and the dinamic of his writing are simple, straight to the point and impossible to do not understand. grab it now, maybe somebody will find this is too useful and they take it down!!!
B002QYUVY8|4|Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. were the main reason I enjoyed this movie so.  At times it got weird but all in all I quite enjoyed it.  I have already recommended it to family and friends.  A good escape from troubles within ones own life.
B000SCHC0Q|5|Another extraordinary look into the beautiful and tragic past of the Afgan people.
B005DOKM9M|2|it does not fit the kindle fire iam going to return it. the color is nice i woulg keep  it if it fit
B00EWCV7QS|5|Heroes should always be like this, where they get hurt, killed and when they win it's after an intense battle with the enemy.  Predator does that and follows a great storyline.  Testosterone city!!
B00M8JCW3E|5|Love the music
B00CL50LEC|5|this was a very funny and awesome movie, my family enjoyed it very much. I would recommend any of my friends to watch this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Colleen  Hoover writes beautifully.  Her ability to bring the emotion into the written word amazing.<br />Her creativity in story telling while consistently supporting time and logic bring a solid plot with no beaches. Her use of humor in conversational exchanges is well done and is expertly woven into scenes where comedic relief is essential. Well done Colleen.
B00070Q7VO|4|This is a very good CD I am totallly happy with it, its a great chill out CD
B005K17RU0|5|Great app,have it on my phone and have used it on that for over a year.Better than the Weather Channel.Far more accurate and much more detailed.Highly recommend.
1476738017|5|I absolutely loved this book.  You couldn't help but love the &#34;grumpy old man&#34; and could relate him to many people I know.  Great read.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Try it. You'll like it. My five year old twin grandsons love it. It's a very realistic game and easy to play.
B0083GQKQG|4|This is was great acting, and a riveting story. It was somewhat confusing at first, but made sense later. It was very hard to watch and a little slow at times. It's worth a watch.
B005OCFHHK|5|I'm a HP fanatic so I love all things HP. This set is an unbelievable value. The seller actually sent me a different set, mine is the 11 disc instead of the 8 at no extra cost. There isn't much to say, it's Blu-ray quality and the sound is great. Order and enjoy.
B00FUZQYBO|5|One of the best books for those who work in or manage a creative team. My UX and Product team are going to be sick of me talking about this book and all the great anecdotes Ed Catmull packed into this read.
B00846REIS|2|Maybe ok for an afternoon read by the pool but even then I couldn't recommend it, there are lots of better books
B0001GF2DS|5|I remember moving my work schedule around just so I could satch the first screening of this extended version when it was broadcast on TV/cable last year.  <br />The extra scenes are nothing earth shattering.  They weren't essential to the story line which was what allowed them to be cut in the first place, but they do add a few nuances and some background to the movie.  I'd put the impact of the added footage about on a par with the \\"extra\\" stuff that was aded to the LOTR special edition DVD's. If you can sit still for 2 hours and 40 minutes of the original, you can probably handle the almost 3 hours in this newer version.<br />There are no major disruptions in continuity or in pacing.  Eastwood's voice still meshes pretty well.  Nothing against Eli Wallach, but his voice is just not up to the explosively emotive bursts the way it was back when the film was made. However, it would have been even more wrong to go with an imitator when you've got the real deal available.<br />I can't tell for sure, but I think they tweaked the remaining audio so that it meshed a little better with the visuals.  For some maybe it's part of the charm, but it has always annoyed me the way that the gunshots never seemed to line up in the whole spaghetti western subgenre.<br />If you're in any way a fan, then it is definitely worth picking up this title to see what the full vision for the movie really was.  There are some \\"director's cut\\" or \\"extended verions\\" out there that end up making the movie worse, this is one of the times where it definitely makes it better.<br />If nothing else, I'd like to see the people who put the effort into restoring the footage rewarded.  I think this is a great and noble niche for the cable/broadcast networks to get into; restoring movies, recovering missing footage, etc., instead of lamely remaking every title they can option.
B00C5W3SBE|5|Everything was in good condition. The cover was a little dented but the discs were great and had no scratches.
B007OAAK0O|5|Great Movie
B00006WUWQ|5|Yeah I did'nt like these movies until about 2000. I did not get it I thought he was serious then I saw it and I understood. There were 3 movies about Austin Powers and his battles against Dr. Evil. I thought the best one has to be the third where they meet Mr. Roboto and they find out Austin and Dr. Evil are brothers. We find out that Dr. Evil was the #1 in his spy class. <br />The Second Movie had the Intro of Mini Me and Fat B******. <br />The First one is the Introduction to the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I really like this game but I don't like time limits wish I could get rid of that aspect.  Overall tho very good game
B00BUCW54Q|2|This is an old style grade b movie.  It's plot is not really believable and the set-up and conclusion are clear from the beginning. I must say though that on a night when I wanted to be mindless, I watched the whole movie through to the end.
B00B2V66VS|5|This game is a total upgrade featuring :<br />ziplines<br />bridges<br />a bigger beast<br />cool turns<br />nice backround<br />even the &quot;I&quot; at the beginning is an upgrade<br />and so much more
B00AFQC4QC|4|I really like book one in this series and will be reading the other two books in this series.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Orphan Black is one of the best first seasons have ever seen, regardless of genre. Strongly recommended. I was engaged right from the start, and the show never failed to deliver.
B006QS07IK|5|Book looks amazing i love how classic it appeals and i can not wait to read! Many thanks! I recommend it !
B005LAIH4A|5|My daughter and I love this movie. It is funny, colorful and has a lot of catchy music. It has the original story mixed with a new story. A lot of people are upset because it is a misrepresentation of a good book. But how does one make a full feature movie from such a short book? I don't know why people are so shocked over it. I also purchased the soundtrack for my daughter.
6305428387|4|I chose this rating because it is an entertaining film, it is funny, and clean.  It is a movie I can share with our children and grandchildren.
061891868X|4|He's a hard read sometimes but worth it. Not a bedtime read, at least for me. Deep and dense. You have to revisit ideas and explanations on occasion... We'll I did.
B0076DEJMO|5|Abercrombie is still doing his thing with Fantasy, which means yet another great book.  Something about it, not quite as good as the First Law Trilogy, but still a fantastic read!
1577311523|5|I am not a follower of Eckhart Tolle like many who live by his every word.  I have meditated for last 20 years. Meditation has transformed my life in ways that I find hard to describe.  I would be fine if I never read another word by Eckhart Tolle, as my Buddhist insight meditations are fully satisfying to me.  Yet, I find it a great blessing that someone like him is with us on this earth. And he is not the only one who is awake - if you see carefully, you will find there have been quite a few enlightened beings or messengers on earth in very recent times, many more than there were in the past (for a small list - J. Krishnamurti, Dalai Lama, Tyohar, Osho, A.H. Almaas, Khalil Gibran, Neale Donald Walsche, and so on).  <br /> <br />I want to address some of the critical comments in the most popular review on this book titled, \\"The Title Says it All,\\" posted on August 26, 2003, by IAF_67 (USA). <br /> <br />The reviewer says, quote,  <br /> <br />\\"To me, it seemed as if the author was simply repeating the same basic idea over and over again; which, again, is not necessarily a bad thing. However, it begins to become annoying when the book has as many pages as this does; and after reading all of them you feel as though you could have just read the title and received all the information from that.\\" <br /> <br />This reviewer is complaining about the fact that this book repeats the idea of being in the \\"now\\" so many different ways. This reviewer is obviously looking for entertaining his \\"mind.\\" He came to this book for the wrong reasons.  The reviewer wants to enter the present moment (as stated in his first para), but it seems by USING the mind.  This book will literally take you \\"out of your mind\\" and move you to your heart.  And repetition is ok for the heart.  Love repeats all the time, yet there is incredible newness if you can be present to many subtle dimensions of love.  Only mind needs continuous diversity of what it perceives as \\"newness\\" because it cannot appreciate the newness in the slightest and subtle changes in the present that keep unfolding.  The trees and animals can feel these, but the human mind is too clouded and burdened with the past and the future to feel these.  I disagree with the reviewer totally about the book being repetitive.  I find that Eckhart Tolle can bring alive the present moment from so many angles.  If your heart is open and mind is silent you will find his writing very potent and loving, opening up new subtle doors on many pages.   <br /> <br />The reviewer goes on further with his critique, quote, <br /> <br />\\"After reading this book a couple times, I still don't really know how to get to that spot of inner peace. I don't know, either, how to feel the \\"...still, observing presence itself behind the content of your mind, the silent watcher\\" (pg. 46). I don't even think there was a technique telling you how to achieve that, actually. Sure, the author has included some meditations, but they're nothing new. The same old \\"Direct your attention into the body. Feel it from within\\" (pg. 93) type meditations, which can be found almost anywhere else, even on web pages (for free, no less) are included in this book.\\" <br /> <br />Whew!  What was the reviewer expecting.  I guess a mechanical technique that instantly enlightens him.  I have meditated for 20 years.  I have experienced moments of bliss many times now, but they do not happen simply by practicing a technique, using the mind.  Wouldn't the whole of humanity be already enlightened if it were so easy?  Letting the mind go and entering the heart is the hardest challenge for human beings.  After all, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and many others have been \\"repeating\\" the same message of love and oneness for centuries.  For this to happen we have to be in a total let go.  Directing your attention to the body is needed to be grounded.  That message wont change even for  human being to be born in 2,500 A.D.   <br /> <br />The spiritual insights do not evolve in the same sense as scientific knowledge evolves.  Spiritual insights remain the same, but since the audience changes, new masters use new words.  The audience was different at the time when Jesus lived, so Jesus used different words, but which conveyed the same insights even back then.  Now the mind of the audience is different (much too clever and sophisticated) and so different words are needed to convey the same insights.   <br /> <br />Yes, you can find similar statements made by many others, but you wont find the aliveness that you will in Eckhart Tolle's words.  Have you heard any of his tapes?  The immense depth and calm in his voice may surprise you.    <br /> <br />Finally, the reviewer says, quote, <br /> <br />\\"Overall, this book did not live up to it's hype. I found it to be long and rambling; the author took the title of the book and expanded it into 191 pages full of the same idea phrased with different words. He attempts to tackle some other subjects too, of course, such as relationships. However, he basically uses the same \\"power of NOW\\" approach to these as well; meaning that he suggested a relationship would evolve into true love when both partners had eliminated their respective egos and become completely immersed in the now. That's the solution for EVERY problem, it seems. So he's just using the same message for different problems, which seems to be more of a \\"pie in the sky\\" promise to me.\\" <br /> <br />This is your personal experience, but please don't exaggerate the importance of your experience for others.  I don't know if you realize that deep down how incredibly \\"simple\\" all of spiritual insights are.  But that is the problem, the mind is too egoistic and complicated to appreciate these insights. You need \\"love\\" to experience the connectedness, \\"awareness\\" to experience the present moment, and \\"honesty\\" to discover who you are.  These same values are also in many spiritual paths, including even the \\"Conversations with God series\\" by Neale Donald Walsch, who is another great spiritual messenger.  The heart can understand these in an instant, but the mind can take eternity, and still not figure it out.  You seem to want different solutions for your different mental problems of worrying, fears, etc. (which you mentioned in your first para).  The truth is that the solutions are not many.  The same key opens up many doors.  Humans want to hear the same solution using different words, however, and so we have so many Masters just doing that.  The variety is needed not because the spiritual insights come in different flavors, but because of the human mind, which has incredible diversity with 6 billion people from so many cultures and conditionings.  So my advice is simple - move to your heart, and you may actually experience the \\"pie in the sky\\" easier than if you were to figure out by continuously \\"thinking\\" using your mind.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone with an open heart.
B00984668E|5|The Sword continue to grow as a band and each offering is slightly better than the last.  Their music is of the same vein as Black Sabbath with lyrics that remind you of something the late, great Ronnie James Dio would write.  If you are a fan of that type of music, definitely check it out.  This album is well worth your time and money.
0762445262|5|very tiny
B009XIXVU6|4|I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting how all of the characters weaved together and intersected lives. I also liked how the author told each part of the story from that character's perspective. I only wish he had included a few more. Overall this was really good. I loved A Thousand Splendid Sun's....but this one was really good.
B002PEP4C8|4|The first half was quite compelling and felt brutally and painfully honest. I wish the author had flushed out the section on recovery (aftermath). That part felt rather rushed. Overall, I would recommend the book to those who want to know more about the profound ways that rape  can impact all aspects of a person. I appreciated that Sebold acknowledged that her rape fit the stereotype of the traditional, violent stranger rape with a minority perpetrator, and she was the \\"ideal virgin white victim.\\" Many other survivors' stories don't fit these stereotypes, and we need to expand our definition beyond this stereotypical rape schema.
B00A6CCF0K|4|Great read. Lots of suspense mixed with unsuspecting horror looming from every corner. Dan Torrance is haunted into adulthood. Def read again.
B002QYNIHU|5|It was fabulous I used it for a custom figure because I just put the super saiyan head on the body that came with the normal goku hair so yay I liked it a lot you should buy it before it runs out because I don't think they are going to reissue it.
B00AF6MF9I|5|Very fun and addicting game I play it all the time on my iPad plus it s free so it's even better
B000FCKGPC|5|Like the first three books Martin continues with the stories of all the cast that we love or hate. The action never stops and the people you love struggle to reach their goals. More often than not obsticles fall in their path challenging to challenge them. Hang on to your chair & enjoy the ride.
B0047WJ12K|1|I watched 45 minutes of this before deciding it was too boring to continue.  If you love CG effects and don't care about an interesting story, this movie is for you.  You have to wonder why an original, creative storyline is a rare animal in hollywood.
B002BWCJOA|5|I love this movie. The music is amazing. There are so many cool hidden things in it. I also like it, because the more you watch it the more you enjoy it.
B008XG1X18|5|Good
B004JN1CW4|5|Read all 3 books in 3 days. Great trio. Wish there were more.
B000U0O9FM|4|Very interesting. But sexist at times (to both men and women). That's just the perspective it's told from. Still, a very interesting read for discussion.
B000WGWQG8|5|I enjoyed this account of John Adams life and our history at times sad but true to life at that time
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This game is fun and addicting if you like the impossible  game you will like this more
B0094BB4TW|1|I stupidly redownload the app and I hate the updated version. The old version was very user friendly, this one not at all. I really wish I could go back to how it was, I loved it then.
0345803507|5|I have recommeded the books to friends and family. The triology was well written,very interesting and I enjoyed reading all three books.
B00000F6LQ|4|good movie. not exactly laugh-out-loud, but has some shining points. best scene is definitely the artur/knight fight, where arthur cuts off all his limbs.
B002KSPKRS|5|I bought these for my brother for Christmas. I never would have paid so much for this type of item, but I was banking on all the positive hype being true. The hype was right. These things are amazing. So amazing that I use them too and will be purchasing a pair for myself soon. Now we look like dorks wearing these headphones inside the house, but for good reason. The new, crisp sounds that you hear and that immerse you from games like Battlefield, Endless Ocean, and Skyrim, or any other favorite game, Dolby Digital supported or not, will breathe new life into your games.<br /><br />Television and movies too are amplified and give you Amazing surround sound and clarity. For a truly awesome experience for all the manly men out there, tune into ESPN or a sports event and wear them in the bathroom  after the morning coffee hits. HEAVEN!! I can be a tech geek when i need to be, but this is not one of those reviews. This review isn't made to note any features or criticizing them. This is just straight to the point, I am a consumer who likes quality and a product that I can honestly say \\"it was worth every penny\\" review.
B0055S348W|5|Works great with my hp office jut 100. I can print via bluetooth from my galaxy tablet anf my s5. Great app. Well worth the money.
B00003CXE7|5|This film spans the fathoms of the human soul, evoking every emotion found in the heart of man at every turn. It evokes the passion of the mob, and the scorn of the despised all in the same breath. Not just a tremendous special FX movie, but one with a beautiful story line. Both bold and ugly at the same time. It is the story which carries this movie all the way to the end. If you are a fan of Braveheart and other historical type films, this film is a must see and a must own. Don't miss it. You'll watch it over and over, and over again.
B000MV9026|5|This is such a cute movie. The music is so great it just makes you want to get up and dance.
B00992CF6W|1|I tryed to get this I got so exited. but a measge came up and said error. and I still try and it sill dose not work :)
B004FEFS5E|5|This is a wonderful book on Exposure.  I think every person interested in photography should get this book no matter if you are a beginner or a professional you will learn something.
B0000VCZK2|5|This gives you everything you have ever wanted and more.  The bet feature in this set is that it gives you two main ways to watch one movie. The regular version and the uncut version.  Every rumer you might have heard about the series that you never saw, comes to you in the uncut version.  I give this my highest marks A+

B003FHGI9W|4|I have had a loyal dog. One that went to lie outside our country church even on Sundays we were out of town. The church bell would ring and people would tell us he laid outside as if we were inside. It happened many times. Hachi had this devotion  to his master.  It was very heartwarming.
B004BLJQOK|5|\\"Let Me In\\" is the Hollywood remake of \\"Let the Right One In\\", a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but both the original film and remake managed to handle these multiple themes in a credible manner.<br /><br />The remake is not exactly faithful to the original, and viewers who have watched both will notice the differences such as the opening scene, the changes in characterization for some of the minor characters, etc. For the most part though, the remake focuses on the essential parts of the story just as in the original and makes for riveting viewing. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for pretty vampires smooching around, or a splatterfest with non-stop action. There's hints of a romance, slowly simmering, a mixture of Gothic and sweet teenage love, and there's also lots of blood, but by no means does this movie careen along - it takes its time developing the characters, drawing viewers into this strange, dark world where nothing is at it appears, and focuses viewers' attention on the two main characters.<br /><br />The story is of teenager Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Owen doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Owen meets a strange girl named Abby [Chloe Moretz] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Abby has just moved into the apartment next door to Owen's with a man Owen thinks is her dad. Despite Abby's words, the pair are drawn to each other, and form a real friendship. For a while at least, Owen remains blissfully unaware of the dark secret hidden by Abby and her `dad'.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Owen and Abby manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role. The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire. Abby is a young-looking  yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see. The film is rated R, with Spanish subtitles, and English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. The film is in color, and the running time is 115 minutes. Special features include an audio commentary with director Matt Reeves; a feature titled From the Inside: A Look At The Making of Let Me In; The Art of Special Effects; Car Crash Sequence Step-By-Step; Deleted Scenes; Trailer Gallery; and, a Poster Gallery.and neither one detracts from the other.

B001HNE3NO|5|I loved reading this story, which, although is fictionalized, could be one of many such stories that happened during WWII.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in history during that time period.  I loved the story line, however, as much as I understand the reason for the ending, I would have liked a happier ending.  I am forever the optimist.
B00IP1CO4Q|5|Great Movie
B00FAX6XQC|5|This is so awesome I play it every day and I loved the free flu credits and the great deals
B0082Z1CVQ|5|Book downloaded to the kindle.  Excited to see this and share this classic with my daughter.  Will re-review when she finishes it.
B00DI75SWM|5|I love this app the only thing that really bugs me about this app is the fact that you have to pay 99&cent;  but your money is going to a good use. :)
B008220DIC|4|All the main actors are simply brilliant especially Joaquin Phoenix and I think even Amy Adams have outdone/outshone the fantastic Seymore Hoffman.<br /><br />  Title says it all about these people.<br /><br />  The film was too long though I think.
B009NG1Q96|5|Excellent book series!! Can hardly put it down!! Great read for all ages.  Keeps your interest the whole time! 😀
B003IKMR0U|5|Love this game! Needed a replacement when our other one went missing.
B001EBYM62|5|They don't make men like Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor anymore. A feel-good movie full of joy and wonderful music, Singin' in the Rain never disappoints!
B009NZQDW2|5|One of my all time favs!
0375842209|5|The Book Thief is a tale of courage and survival in a time of madness. The author creates people very much like ourselves and our own neighbors who might have lived in a community not far from Dauchau. Through the eyes of death and a child, we are charged to look at ourselves as non-Jews, patriotically supporting our leaders, perhaps fearing for our own well-being and that of our loved ones or just wanting to get by as the war comes closer as we watch the endless march of starved human beings disappearing into an agony we refuse to imagine. It is a story not about the \\"bad\\" Germans, but a story of a people manipulated by the media and leaders of their time and of the few who saw through the veil of deceit and made dangerous choices for right. What choice would you have made? What choices are you making today?
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Another great Baldacci book. I never seem to get enough of a Balacci fix. The books a page turner that ends way to quickly I read it in six hours.
B0029LCJJS|5|The Tudors takes you to the 16th century court of King Henry VIII with all the secrecy, lies and manipulations of all the characters.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is outstanding as King Henry VIII from his youth to his grave. Henry, a man of great passion and lust, moves from youthful princely arrogance into a spiral of paranoia and madness as he loves, hates and destroys with equal passion everyone around him.  This is a must see for all who are history buffs of this era.
B008K8VDPU|5|This is a great way to learn how to play tunes on a keyboard. While it may seem simple at first, there are some powerful tools within the app. The ability to search, save, and loss MIDI files to play is very useful.
B007FEFLTO|5|Follett continues holding the reader's attention with a stimulating combination of history and novel.  Am looking forward to Book 3 of the Century Trilogy!
B0052RDHTM|5|One of the ebst book I've read recently. Ken Follet can be a little bit hard to read. Almost a thousand pages, and sometimes long descriptions. But in this book I think he redeemed himself. The story is interesting, the descriptions on a right rithim and lenght, and you learn a lot about the lauching of World War I, mainly in relation to aspects that you usually don't find in history books, but which are as true as the well known ones.
B00BMKDTNC|5|I was saddened when I learned of Robert Jordan's death.  I have to give Kudos to Brandon Sanderson and the collaboration with RJ's widow.  This was an ending that I could live with and was not disappointed.  What a journey.  If you like epic fantasy this is a great series!
B005GVF95O|4|Very cute puzzle game for little ones. Super easy to use, the pieces pop right in. I wish there was a way to turn off the sound.
B00FWLSOOG|5|my sun likes it! he watched the second time immediately after the first.
B00688628M|5|One of the best
B00PTB7B34|5|This game is amazing. Create your own base, attack other bases, join alliances, request aid from your alliances. The whole deal!
B00NOYXRB8|5|Love the new arrangements
B00FAPF5U0|5|Great being able to play on my Kindle finally!  I'm so addicted!  The resolution and gameplay is as good as my desktop!  But I can go anywhere with it.
B003FSTN52|5|I've watched this show since the beginning episode and love it. It's really a joy to watch commercial free on a lazy afternoon. It brings home how great this show really is! Will purchase the rest of the seasons too.
B00632HWOG|1|It constantly doesn't let me view attachments or when i try to upload them, it sends the message minus the attachments. It's slow to respond & half the time isn't responsive
B00338QENI|5|This book was very interesting. It keeps you wondering how someone could do something like that to someone. How they can just take advantage.I highly suggest this book to anyone and everyone.
B000Y7U98C|5|I literally stopped breathing toward the end of this film. Danny Boyle sets up his international crew in an enclosed space with death lurking around every corner, and both the cinematography and the acting is brilliant. Chris Evans' scenes were particularly riveting. If you go in with the expectation that you are watching a psychological thriller rather than a hardcore sci-fi film, you will have your head on straight - I was frequently terrified throughout the second half. Definitely in my top twenty if not my top ten films of all time.
B00H8C4HZ2|5|I truly enjoyed this movie as well as feeling ashamed as watching it. I was born in the 1940's and remember the early 1960's with all the rioting and fighting for equality. Though I never understood why the blacks were treated differently, most people my age were simply raised in families that practiced discrimination. I remember my mother washing out my mouth with a bar of Ivory soap for saying the &#34;N&#34; word in a simple kids game of eenie meenie minee moe. This movie should be seen by all kids today as a reminder of how far we have come. Let us never forget and learn.
B005COO1X6|5|Nice short story
B0094BB4TW|5|I need facebook to be able to keep in touch with Friends and Family in other states and cities. A must have item!
B0000AQVCL|4|With all the pop crap that is out on the radio today, along comes Jet with a real Rock &amp; Roll record.  The Amazon review seems to think that the lyrics on this album are &quot;banal&quot; and &quot;a problem&quot;.  No one ever said that lyrics on AC/DC albums (&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;) or every album by the Stones (&quot;Under Pressure of the Night!&quot;) were poetry.  Rock and Roll is about a feeling, a mood, a look, a sounds...and all these elements combined.  <br />Jet make you want to get up and dance...and drink...and party.  The songs, for the most part, are simple chord progressions with catchy hooks.  The band looks the part and actually writes the music while playing the obligatory guitar, bass and drums and creating driving rock that begs to be cranked.<br />If you're looking for deep lyrics, look elsewhere...if you are looking for an updated rock &amp; roll record reminiscent of the Stones and the Who with a lot of spunk that will get you partying, get thee to your nearest record store and pick this up!
B004TE6F66|5|Great expectations come with any sequel book. We expect the next book to be as good or better than the previous. Linger defiantly did not disappoint. Again I was pulled into the story right from the first page.<br /><br />Grace and Same are together now but they will still have to fight to stay together. Sam struggles to deal with his wolf past while Grace has something gnawing inside trying to free itself. He has a feeling what it is but she tries to push through it for Sam... because she can't be without him ever again.<br /><br />Cole, a new wolf, chose the become a wolf. This was the perfect way for him to leave his past behind and lose himself forever. He is dangerously handsome and secretly smart. His brains are the key to discovering more about the wolves.<br /><br />Isabel struggles to deal with the loss of her brother after her and Grace tried to cure him from turning into a wolf. The experiment worked on Sam but had a deadly effect on her brother.<br /><br />Isabel and Cole have a connection in this story. As Isabel says: \\"I had this feeling that he and I, in this moment, were a car crash, and instead of putting on the brakes, I was hitting the accelerator.\\"<br /><br />Just as in Shiver is told in Grace and Sam's point of view, Linger is told in Grace, Sam, Isabel and Cole's point of view. You may think that this could get confusing but you would be wrong. It was clearly written and clear to understand. This allows the reader to see everything from their points of view and I loved it!<br /><br />Linger had me staying up late into the night and sneaking a page here and there wherever I could.  Towards the end I could feel how it was going to end and my heart ached for Sam .<br /><br />I highly recommend you read this book if you haven't already read the first installment, Shiver. It does not disappoint and it will have you desperately wanting to read the last in the trilogy ~ Linger~ which is scheduled to come out in July 2011.<br /><br />Congratulation Maggie for another fantastic novel!!<br /><br />I leave you with one of my favorite quotes from Linger~<br /><br />\\"I won't let this be my good-bye. I've folded one thousand paper crane memories of me and Grace, and I've made my wish. I will find a cure. And then I will find Grace.\\"  ~Sam~favorite quotes from Linger~    \\"I won't let this be my good-bye. I've folded one thousand paper crane memories of me and Grace, and I've made my wish. I will find a cure. And then I will find Grace.\\"    ~Sam~
B004T4LUPW|5|I've tried two other calendar apps but I didn't like their limits.  This does absolutely everything you need a calendar to do. Plus it has tasks and agenda included.  Yes for an app it is \\"pricey\\" at six bucks...Lol.  But you can't put a price on how efficient and organized it makes you.<br /><br />Yes it took me a while to get it set up with each view (day, week, month,year, task, and agenda) appearing with the beautiful and vibrant color combos I chose that were unique to that view.  But once you have that done it is a cinch. So many options of colors and types of reminders that it's impossible not to end up with the calendar that makes you smile every time you use it.  And you can make an entry an individual color and set that color on the color wheel so you can easily have that at the ready for the next event you want to use it for. So you don't have to have different calendars on Google to have different colors as someone else posted.<br /><br />One of the seamless features is that you can view it offline and add events without an internet connection and it immediately synchs to and updates your other calendars as soon as a connection is available.  Love it so much this is my 1st review on Amazon!
B000R9NDI0|5|They are just plain amazing. Especially on vinyl. Get this if you are either a huge fan or just being introduced to Simon and Garfunkel. It won't disappoint.
B008BU75IQ|5|I could hardly put this book down. I have loved all of his books. I sure hope he is finishing his next book in the series. I too wonder how many there will be. I was not disappointed at all in this book.
B00HY7VU60|5|Awesome awesome awesome
B007M45PMU|5|Drawn in by the new song...Ho Hey and have really enjoyed the whole CD.....I Love discovering new music by accident!
B00DMCV7K0|5|I must say, after reading this, I was compelled to read about the author.  How did she become so interested in this and what did she base this book on?  One cannot help but feel the sadness of the times and how the entire family and household experienced such sadness over their whole lives.  Hope developed by the end, but at such cost!  Thank you, Sue!
B00FEMJF6O|2|I just got to level 21 last night then this morning when I turned on my kindle and I got on the game it was at level 1 and it started over I had $45,000 on the game and now I have zero!!! I am so mad and it won't go back to level 21 I want to give up on this but I love it to much!!!! I NEED someone to fix so I can go back to level 21!!!!!!!
B00GT4V5DM|5|A great software<br />I use it weekly to verify my system.<br />It has a great detection.<br />To be use belong an antivirus suite.
0920668372|1|I added this book to my baby registry without actually reading it beforehand based on all the positive reviews. This book is the saddest thing I've ever read! I was crying my eyes out when I first read it. Why would anyone want to read this to their child?! It's incredibly creepy. I'd return it back in a second except amazon is charging me $3.99 for shipping it back. I think I'll just donate it. I want it out of my house!
1416549447|5|After getting hooked on marathoning and discovering minimalism. I didn't think I could actually enjoy running even more. ChiRunning has done it! The body sense and that focus I need for a pleasant running experience are the big things I got from this book. If you are finding runs hard or not so enjoyable, read this book.
B00JBGSHSQ|1|I would give this 0 stars of that were possible.  I am not a literal believer in Biblical stories, however, I was hoping to see an interesting interpretation of the story of Noah that was based on the historical time period and within some historical context. This movie has nothing to do with the the Bible story of Noah and is simply a contrived and poorly worked science fiction movie set on some planet that does not even represent Earth in any stretch of the imagination along with conjured myths of ancient creatures and technologies that do not fit the supposed historical time frame of the Biblical story.
B005ORVMCY|5|excelente boxset
B005VPRETE|3|I only chose &#34;okay&#34; because I could not purchase just the cat which was all I needed and it was a greater expense than what I wanted to pay.  However, I am sure someone will have fun putting it together as I enjoyed putting the &#34;Downtown Bakery&#34; together myself!
B004GJDQT8|5|Customer service were very helpful
B004H8GLXQ|5|I don't understand how ANYONE can rate this book under five stars. I read it during a cold fall, and it was marvelous. I hope this author continues to write. It is one of the best modern novels I have ever, ever read. Seriously...this book deserves TEN stars or more. Ignore the people who rate it lower. They are obviously looking for something more simply written. This book was FANTASTIC!!!
6304696558|5|Always fun to watch Goldie!
B005TKD6NY|5|Excellent
B005HV6Y84|4|I boought it to get  the Christina perry song for my girlfriend as she loves it.  we found it had several other songs that were pretty good too.  It is an OK CD
B00G0A6UU8|5|I saw this movie with my dad and sister when I was a kid and enjoyed it than but was not sure what was going on, and I was a bit disturbed by the images, but still liked it.  Watched it recently and enjoyed the story and everything else.  But guessing you knew this since I gave it 5 stars
B007PKSN6Q|5|Fun music - After the show in Las Vegas, (attended twice), had to have it, & love it!
0789318121|5|My husband got this book for me for Christmas, as I am a huge fan of The Dark Knight and Batman Begins.  It was very interesting how the makers of the Dark Knight described the batsuit and how they came up with the underground batcave.  I have just begun reading it.  There are many great photos and some interesting artwork.  The script does account for a large part of the book, but I enjoyed it as well, as I love to write in my spare time.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the book.
B00009Z576|3|I think every one will agree that 1971-1975 was the heyday of YES. Nothing approaches the creativity of this period. Wakeman was good, but Kaye had his moments. Howe was an overall upgrade. Squire was constantly a superior bassist. Anderson had uniqe vocal stylings, if somewhat repetitive, and the lyrical content, no matter from what quarter, could get tedious if one is honest. <br /> <br />So what to make of The Y-uggl-ES? I'd heard a couple of tracks from DRAMA on the radio (late night of course) many years ago. Thought it was decent, but nothing to run out and buy, especially when $$$ was extremely precious and very fine judgements needed to be made where to allocate it. <br /> <br />But this is good. Better than 90125/Big Generator stuff IMO. 90125 has some good cuts (I do like it overall), but BG (what I've heard of it) makes my head hurt. When the chicks started to dig it, I had to punch out. Love didn't find a way and YES found a way out of my pocket book.... <br /> <br />Machine Messiah is good, though seems a bit contrived in its complexity. White Car - fine. Does It Really Happen - opens good, sustains a punch. Into The Lens I liked the few times I heard it on the radio, haven't changed my mind. Tempus Fugit-very good, but overhyped a bit as an all time classic. I like Into The Lens a little better. <br /> <br />Overall the album is very punchy, Alan White seems to be a lot more upfront in the mix (to my ear). Very riffy, though Howe still has his affectations that makes him Howe popping in now and again, but doesn't become tiresome. It just has a fresh sound, but is still proggy without sacrificing totally to the pop element.  <br /> <br />There just must have been something about this time in the prog timeline - between the heavy prog period of the 70's and the 'sell outs' by Yes, Asia, Genesis, etc etc. IMO this disk and Genesis' Duke (also 1980) could be played back to back and be in the same groove. Lighter and new wavey in spots, and crunchy in others. But still this side of the prog fence. Not that some of the 80's stuff from the prog guys in general wasn't good stuff, but I'm just in a different place when I want to listen to it. It's the difference between music for the road and errand running and music for the headphones and dimlights. This is still for the headphones and a couple hours of 'alone time'. <br /> <br />Squire is said to see this as the low point of Yes, but I wonder if he meant the material produced for this album, which is, overall, very good, or the subsequent tour when Horn's voice couldn't handle the strain of singing a key higher than he was naturally made to, and Squire refused to change the key in which it was played. It is felt the live shows suffered at the end, and the seeds of discontent were sown. <br /> <br />
6305750750|5|I am crazy about all things Star Wars, and even back in third grade when I din't like it there were rumors flying around about Episode One. When I went to see the movie I was the only one in my family who new what was  going on. I was extremely impressed by the graphics and artistic value of  this movie. I liked how it focused on the Jedi a lot more than the original  trilogy. Not to say this movie is better than the originals! I watch'em all  and read all the books and manga comics I can get my hands on. Episode One  is special to me because someday, when I'm like, 40 or something, I'll be  able to say &quot;I grew up when the Phantom Menace came out.&quot; I'll  admit that the commercialization of this movie was a bit much, but I still  think this is the greatest movie of the Twenty First century!
B004SJ3BCI|5|My daughter really enjoys this game.  She has been playing it non-stop since down loading it.  She is a quick learner
B0055SWM08|5|I love this game, after a long day at work this is definitely my outlet. I love the soothing music and creative puzzles
B008WOULPK|5|I have never had any interest or knowledge about the world of 'fashion'.  However, this book was very interesting on so many fronts.  I especially liked the respect demonstrated for the photographers she worked with; her candidness; her respect for everyone she worked with and especially for herself.  I would like to find a copy of her &#34;Cat&#34; book.
B0051UP5NQ|4|Too hard to use on my size of screen...
B0012QCZ54|5|I bought number four and so decided I needed the whole set and these where priced right so that I would have them available when my granddaughters and I want to have a marathon night.
6305603847|5|Takes a great album to the next level visually, emotionally, aurally, educationally, and passionately... R rated tho and be ready to explain WW 2 and the threat they were to Europe while they were killing so many innocent people. Know your band...
B008SAZHLQ|4|I have to be completely honest, I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. I almost didn't even buy it until I read a review on Amazon that talked me into it, and I am SO glad I did! This isn't your typical high school young adult romance, the main characters aren't the most popular kids in school with all the other characters in the book just waiting for thier chance to date them. They are real people who you can relate to, they have insecurities and flaws, but regardless they find that one other person who can see past all of that and fall in love with the person they are deep down inside. All in all I think this was a great read!! The only thing I would've like to have seen would be more closure at the end, but don't we all wish that about our first love?
B00JJ9G9F8|5|Simply GREAT!
038572179X|4|\\"Atonement\\" is an excellent read.  I don't read much fiction but my neighborhood book club encouraged me to try this one. I am glad I did. The character development was penetrating.
B00B2V66VS|5|This is an amazing game they uprgraded it from the first one a lot I recamemd it its very addictive
B00DJFIMW6|5|It took several tries to get this game to work on my kindle fire, but it was worth the frustration. This game is so much fun. Such a good quality game to be a free one.
1594481717|1|I bought this book recently but after a few pages it just became too simplistic in its content and I began to wonder whether it was even worth the effort to write such a book unless of course you can make some money from sticking a few ideas down on paper.  It appears that hardly any serious reserach and investigation had been done to support the thesis.  Waste of money as it could be sped read in the bookshop in about 5 minutes and you would learn just as much as you would from buying the book.
B00I75EROU|5|Joy land is one of king's best. It was hard to give it a rest once started. It mad me mad that I picked the \\"bad guy\\" early, but it was only a guess.
B000QRIGLC|5|This story is simply amazing, hero's fighting for each other without hesitation is truly inspirational. These men will never be forgotten and will live forever throughout history.
B004DMIIOG|5|This is one of the best that I've watched. And I've been around a while now. Seen a lot of movies/anime. You'll probably be burnt out emotionally by the end of this one.
B000069AUI|4|Great music, astonishing album art. In My Place is wonderful. Buy this album and give your rock collection some depth.
B003ITZBW2|4|Regarding the field of original animated direct-to-DVD movies, DC is kicking the crapdoodle out of Marvel. BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, running at around 76 minutes, is another well-executed, highly charged superhero thriller, and it's dark and compelling, and never mind that I wasn't that into the Red Hood saga when it was in comics form. This movie improves on the comic book.<br /><br />Remember about 20 years ago when DC put out an 800 number so that you and I could call in to determine Robin's fate? And the votes came in, and that marked the end of the annoying second Boy Wonder. Since then, Robin's death has been regarded as Batman's greatest failure.<br /><br />BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD opens in Bosnia and has us reliving that story, with the Joker's savage beating and eventual murder of Jason Todd, with the Batman come too late to save him. Five years later, a new masked man's come to Gotham City, and he's playing both sides of the field, a vigilante vastly more ruthless than the Dark Knight and simultaneously a crime lord craving a slice of that crooked pie. The Red Hood believes he's saving Gotham by taking control of the city's criminal elements. Inexorably he carves out his own territory, digesting chunks of the Black Mask's empire, igniting a gang war. Batman finds himself caught in the middle, and then he begins to harbor a horrifying suspicion as to who's really under the Red Hood.<br /><br />Unlike in the comic book, there isn't much of a mystery regarding the Red Hood's true identity. Instead of the mystery element, we're enfolded in bits of powerful storytelling. Almost shattering. The strength of the narrative lies in how it keeps resurrecting themes of broken relationships and failed promises and warped vengeance and devastating guilt, and it's like picking and picking at a scab until the blood seeps. In their final showdown, the Red Hood fiercely justifies himself to Batman and, honestly, I think he makes some very valid points. For instance, how many deaths is Batman indirectly responsible for by allowing the Joker to live?<br /><br />Tim Drake, the third Robin, isn't here, and it's a good move. His presence would've made the story more cluttered. Instead, Batman gets an assist from Nightwing, and it sucks that Nightwing isn't in the movie more. Neil Patrick Harris absolutely does him justice and provides levity to a brooding tale, but then again Dr. Horrible can do no wrong. For a voice cast that's new to DC animation, these actors perform well and emotionally hook you in. I would never have thought of Bruce Greenwood to voice Batman, but he's very effective, although I hesitate to say that he makes Batman his own. I hear too much of Kevin Conroy in his performance. John Dimaggio as Joker takes a bit of getting used to, as well, but it's not bad. His verbals are deeper than Mark Hamill's, and it helps that this Joker is depicted as with more bulk. Jensen Ackles (SUPERNATURAL) makes the Red Hood an almost sympathetic and certainly tragic character. I have to say, I very much see where the Red Hood is coming from.<br /><br />Pretty good animation, even though Black Mask looks more like the Red Skull. Very good action, an appropriate dose of violence, with the Red Hood giving as good as he gets, although I like that he does get hit, he does get bloodied. Except that he's too stubborn to quit. Batman, of course, is Batman. This film earns its PG-13 rating just by virtue of its disturbing opening scene. The \\"payoff\\" moments take place off-screen, but you can't prevent those violent images from surfacing in your brain. Joker, deranged and taunting, applying that crowbar to Jason Todd. Even though DC makes the film more accessible by refraining from showing bruises or too much blood on Jason. Still, don't let the younger kids see this. Also, along the way, the Red Hood kills several times.<br /><br />Now can I please talk about the Jonah Hex animated short? It continues that stamp of excellence that so marked the Spectre animated short featured on the JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS DVD. This gritty short captures the essence of what makes Jonah Hex work as an anti-hero more so than that live action disaster. Thomas Jane voices everyone's favorite scar-faced western bounty hunter, and Jane is loads better than Josh What's-his-face. The story finds Hex meting out his own uncompromising brand of frontier justice to a murderous madam (voiced by Linda Hamilton). And, if you already haven't heard, Warner Brothers is planning to release a DC Showcase DVD featuring four animated shorts: the Spectre short, this Jonah Hex one, the Green Arrow short which will be on the upcoming SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE DVD, and a never before seen short: \\"Superman/Shazam! - The Return of Black Adam.\\" Look for that DVD on November 2010.<br /><br />Back to BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD.

B001FB4W16|4|I agree with everything in the previous reviews, especially the Tara/demon  and V-fantasies subplots. I got hooked on the series from Episode One and bought a boxed set of the books since I didn't want to wait for the new season to start. There are TONS of differences between the books and the series, though the series is able to stand on its own. I think the differences are good since you don't know exactly where the HBO series is going to go from here.  I think Anna makes a wonderful Sookie and Stephen Moyer is a perfect Bill. However, I think Alexander Skarsgaard falls short of Eric. Sam Trammel does a great job as Sam Merlotte and I love how he and Anna are able to portray the intense relationship between the two characters. Of all the relationships between the characters in the books or the series, theirs is my favorite.  I did have difficulty with the series finale. Bill stepping into the sunlight to try to save Sookie was very romantic and incredibly unbelievable. Not to mention, if they are going to follow at least some of the plot of the books, it sets up a problem later in the series when Bill's reasons for coming to BonTemp are revealed. And Tara's car accident and rescuer will make season two interesting as to how they bring it all together with the plot line of the book, or if they even try.  I do have to say, I love the series-all in all. The acting is incredibly good and the story keeps you interested except for the few errant sub-plots that I watched once and then skipped over on subsequent viewings (thank God for Tivo). Sookie's shock at her Grandmother's death and everyone's reactions to that were extremely well done.  I have had some people react negatively to all the sex scenes in the series but I believe they are an essential part of the books and the series. They give you alot of insight into the characters and how they interact with the world and each other.  So, 4 stars-if I could give it 4 1/2 I would and I will keep waiting for season two.I just hope they make it all the way through the series. If so, we have quite a few seasons ahead of us.

B00003CWL6|5|In this story of American angst and family degeneration, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, father and husband, who hates his job, is getting fed up with his wife, and dislikes his life in general. One day, he snaps. He realizes how empty his life is, quits his job, and ceases to care about anything. He becomes free.<br />First, the acting is among the best dramatic work you'll ever see in a film. Kevin Spacey (one of the best actors in film right now) and Annette Bening have some excellent performances. By now, we know that characters like Lester are the perfect roles for Spacey- cynical, attitudinal, sarcastic. The way he delivers his lines and acts is very impressive: managing to drop the subtlest notes of sarcasm and irony into his voice, being cool yet so acidic at the same time, and injecting his attitude with such cynicism and repressed emotion, he shows in this film why he's one of our best. Likewise, Annette Bening shines and is almost scary in how deeply she seems involved in her character, projecting her hyper uneasiness and the sense that she knows how pointless her life is, yet still tries to hide it.<br />American Beauty discuss the image of the perfect American middle-class family, and the reality of it. In Lester's family and marriage, there is no American beauty. The film makes the case that true &quot;American beauty&quot; is probably not what you think it is- namely, not the seemingly happy family or guy with a nice job. But rather, real Beauty is to be found everywhere in life, if one simply looks for it. Lester snaps because he's intelligent: he realizes that his life holds no meaning for him, he hates his job, and his marriage is fake. Therefore, he quits, not just literally (his job), but figuratively (his former dull life), and tries to reinvigorate his life. He looks for Beauty.<br />Likewise, Wes Bentley's neighbor, who falls in love with Lester's daughter, is an interesting and ironic character- he always looks depressed and dark, and spends his day simply recording mundane events, like a plastic bag floating in the wind. He shows footage of this meek, pathetic bag being tossed around in the wind, to Lester's daughter, because in this he finds Beauty. He is comforted by the idea that all of us, like the bag, are being tossed around in life, but that it's all in God's hands.<br />I must mention how skillfully the film/script handles its teenage characters- they aren't stupid or caricatured, and they don't just mindly hate their parents for no reason, or anything like that. They are given personalities, and credibility (for we see, looking at Lester and his wife, that there may be a very good reason they don't want to be like them).<br />This is part dark comedy and part drama, and I'm glad that, at the point when Lester decides to quit and do whatever he wants to do, it doesn't become a full-blown, cheesy comedy about a guy &quot;letting it all go.&quot; The film could've easily done that and turned into a series of comedy sketches involving Lester doing silly and wacky things with his freedom, but it didn't. (There are some times when it comes close, though.) Instead, it decides to create great drama out of it.<br />This film makes a statement about American life and what it could turn into in extreme cases. It's about gaining freedom from an ugly, empty life, about appearances and the reality behind them. Take Mrs. Burnham. She's a real-estate agent, and she spends days tidying up a house in order to get a sale from someone; and when she doesn't, she breaks down. She's always busy doing something- cleaning, dusting, trimming the flowers, etc.- to keep herself occupied so that she doesn't realize the truth: that her life is empty. She never stops denying it to herself until the exciting climax. Lester, her husband, realizes it sooner; he comes to the conclusion that their marriage is simply an advertisement, a message to the world saying &quot;Hey, look at us, we're married, we're happy!&quot; And ironically, Lester's job (before he quit) was in advertising. Even his neighbor, the homophobic, strict, angry ex-colonel, has something repressed inside him. <br />I must mention the excellent direction and cinematography for this film, which are impressive, from the sweeping pans of the camera to the surreal dream sequences Lester has when fantasizing about his daughter's cheerleader friend (rose petals, which come to symbolize the passion that has left Lester's life, swirl around her whenever he thinks of her). <br />In short, the central theme of this film is &quot;look closer.&quot; If you think you see American beauty in our culture today, or if you think there is no real beauty left in the world today, look closer. Behind the advertisements, behind all the ugliness in this culture and life, look closer to find real American Beauty.

B00HTYTQ5A|5|Enjoyable television with a humorous twist. Mysterious and intelligent, well written with a twist. I enjoyed all 3 seasons tremendously!
B008M4MB8K|4|Descriptive text makes it seem as if you might be buying the super-duper special edition that comes in a replica of Deckard's briefcase.  It isn't, and that text seems lifted directly from the text for that edition or a catch-all release from the studio.  Still, I got it at a great price and it includes the elusive Theatrical Cut (still the best in my opinion.)  Even so, it's a nice package with four versions of the film (Theatrical, International Theatrical, Director's, and Final Cuts) and a smattering of concept art, stills, and storyboards included (not to mention the bonus materials on the third disc.)  Looks good on the shelf and a good buy for fans that aren't superfans.
0671027344|4|One great book, which illustrated the hard ships of growing through the eyes of a teenager. Humorist and serious at different sections within the story. I really enjoyed how the book was written because it was more personal, written in journal form. This book will help other teens and maybe even some parents to understand their gaps a little better. I highly recommend this book to teens and parents. I thought this story was going to be boring because all it mainly talks about is the life and the struggles of different situations that one faces in growing up being different, unaccetped, drug, and understanding ones self.

B00005JMJ4|1|I saw this movie on a whim because it was playing on my college campus and the ticket was two bucks. When it was over, I started thinking about what I could have done with that two hours instead of watch this crap.<br />Shockingly, I've encountered many people who thought that this movie was &quot;brilliant,&quot; and that if I didn't like it that I just &quot;didn't understand it.&quot; What's to understand? This movie has no plot, the humor is weak...it's basically as bad as a student art film.<br />I've since come to realize that this movie suffers from the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (ENCS). In the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, a vain emperor employs two con artists to tailor a new set of clothes for him. According to the con men, the clothing is so fine that it can only be seen by those of high intelligence. So the con men start weaving nothing, and everyone who goes to examine the &quot;clothing&quot; pretends that they can see it simply because they don't want people to think that they are too dumb to see it. The emperor goes so far as to &quot;wearing&quot; the &quot;clothes&quot; (so basically he's naked) because he's afraid that people will think he is dumb if he admits that he cannot see the fibers.<br />This movie reminded me of that. It's a film with a meandering plot and terrible characters disguised as a &quot;brilliant, intellectual film.&quot; I think most of the people who thought it was brilliant are simply too pompous to admit that the movie was garbage. Instead, they like to think that they are intelligent enough to understand the &quot;hidden meanings.&quot; What hidden meanings? <br />A movie's principal purpose should be to entertain. Everything else comes second. So what if this film is considered to have hidden meanings and symbolism? It failed to entertain me, so in essence it failed as a film.

B00005JKCF|5|As far as super-hero movies go, they are usually either 'hit or miss.'  Several have done extremely well in the past (ex. Superman, Batman, X-men) while others have failed miserably. Spider-man has been caught in a plethora of legal battles for well over the past decade, which have hindered its ability to come to the big screen.  BUT, it finally got here! And let me tell you, as far as super-hero movies go, they don't get any better than this! But, that's not all...this movie is a great movie in general, regardless of the fact that it is about a super-hero. <BR>The movie manages to tell the story of Spider-man's origin (which could be a movie in itself), while also weaving in a bad guy to the plot. This movie shines in several areas:<BR>This movie couldn't have been cast better. Tobey Maguire perfectly fits the roll of Peter Parker (Spider-man's alter ego), meshing both Parker's typical teen angst and confusion, as well as his nerdiness and the fact that he is a complete social misfit. Kirsten Dunst is gorgeous as the red-headed Mary Jane Watson (the love interest), and purposely tried to make her character less ditsy than she is in the comics. Dafoe is fantastic as the psychotic Green Goblin, and even the Macho Man Randy Savage has a small, but funny role.<BR>This movie also shines in the visual effects.  Spidey's swinging from building to building was mostly computer-generated, but it stil manages to keep some element of realism (to the complete extent that you can in a movie of this type). The flips and the flexibility and sheer grace that Spidey leaps from the buildings exemplifies the physical and athletic change that Peter Parker goes through after he is bitten by the spider. <BR>Finally, the love interest is actually believable!  Most super-hero movies tend to have very corny, rather unnecessary love scenes, but this one is different.  You can actually feel the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane.  <BR>The costumes are also great, but I won't go on and on about those. Let just say that they certainly managed to do each character justice. Go see for yourself.<BR>So, if you were ever a fan of comic books, see this movie. If you like fun action movies, see this movie. If you want to see some fantastic, roller-coaster sequences through the buildings of New York city, see this movie.  It is great for kids, for adults, and all in between.  This movie will not disappoint!!!

Just enough tension between the astronauts to make the journey believable. And just enough crazy, humor, terror and calm acceptance to make The Martian believable.

0545265355|4|The books are amazing in themselves. I highly recommend them to everyone, and ask them to at least give it a try. However, the last book of the series was received as damage, but still readable. I'm pretty sure this has nothing to do of the seller, I believe it was the packaging company themselves who distributed the books at the beginning. The shipment was on time, and I was pleased with the seller. I would purchase items again from them if the chance came.
B008AK8FHM|4|I found this book to be good. I wish Dr. A would have answered the questions he asked while on the other side however. He is a Dr. And therefore he used a lot of medical terms I could not understand but in all the message was received that there is life after death.

B0000524CY|1|Beware!  \\"The Version You've Never Seen\\" is either a joke or somebody's colossal mistake.  There appear to be scenes left out, at least compared to my memory of the original, which makes the plot frustratingly hard to follow in places.  By the end my head was spinning and I was vomiting pea soup.  The Exorcist is a great film, definitely five stars, but spend your money on one of the other versions.  This turkey is going in the trash instead of to Goodwill; I'm not a sadist.

B000002JS0|4|When I bought this album, the only song I have heard was &quot;T.N.T.&quot; which is a great song.  But, I wanted to learn more about their early day.  This was one of the first AC/DC albums I ever bought, even before I bought &quot;Back in Black&quot;!  This album is really good.  It kicks off with the RIPPING &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top&quot;.  It is followed by the rebellious &quot;Rock and Roll Singer&quot;, then &quot;The Jack&quot;.. .this song is an awesome one to see more bluesy type stuff that they can do.  After &quot;Can I Sit Next To You&quot;, the album seems to lose some of its edge but recovers by the end of the album.  I ended it with a feel-good feeling.  It is a hell of a debut, and it set a precedent as to how AC/DC would play their music from then until their lead man died:  really damn good.
0743216458|5|\\"War is hell!\\"<br />Stephen E. Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\" proves that the above saying is no mere cliche.<br />Having been born in Amsterdam in 1950, I grew up hearing firsthand stories of the hellish war from the perspective of an occupied people. I married the daughter of an American G.I. who served in the Pacific during WWII, but it hasn't been until my son began asking him questions a few years ago that we began to hear about his experiences.<br />Ambrose vividly tells the story of Easy Company, from their rigid training in 1942 to their drop on D-Day and their brutal marches and battles to help liberate France, Belgium, and Holland before crossing the Rhine and heading for Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest.\\"<br />This book is not for the faint of heart. The following quote gives you a brief idea of what I'm talking about. \\"The soldier's concern is with death, not life, with destruction, not construction. The ultimate destruction is killing another human being.\\" Here Ambrose pauses on page 310 to summarize what he spells out in graphic detail on the pages preceding and following.<br />Why was this book written? Ambrose quotes Captain Richard \\"Dick\\" Winters who wrote, \\"...we wondered if the people would ever know what it cost the soldiers in terror, bloodshed, and hideous, agonizing deaths to win the war (page 316).\\" War IS hell, and these guys went through it.<br />I thank Dr. Ambrose for writing this book, and especially for telling the readers what these men did with their lives after the war. Many of us know men (and women) from this generation who haven't talked about what they went through. This book will at least give you a taste of what it was like.<br />I recently talked to a Vietnam War veteran who said that war veterans are often the last ones who want to go to war. If you read this, you'll understand why.

Even within Willis's marriage, he sees only the plastic-perfect version of his wife that he wants seen, not the actual, flesh and blood woman he married.<br /><br />Willis, as he so often does, plays the role of a police investigator. This time, the investigation starts when someone's plastic public presence is destroyed - no big deal, since killing a remote-controlled robot is only vandalism. Soon, however, it turns out that something terrible has happened, something impossible. The whole world of synthetic presences is under attack without even knowing it. The rest turns into chases, guns, and last minute saves. You know, the usual.<br /><br />But, as usual, Willis does a pretty good job with the role he's given. This could have been a much more thoguhtful movie, going deeper into the world of hidden people, but it's not that movie. It's good science fiction adventure, with a backdrop of Boston's \\"Brutalist\\" architecture that fits the bleak mood perfectly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00TJ69DHM|5|What a strong and touching song. RIP Paul Walker!
B00B5HQLMI|5|Enjoyed absolutely every minute of this movie. This totally makes up for Quantum  of  Solace, which was such a disappointment.  I like the fact that the writers identified James is aging, but he is still golden. The relationship between James and M is really tested, and shows their respect and admiration for one another.  The locations shots are beautiful. The night scene in shanghai was gorgeous.<br /><br />I love Javier Barden as the villain. I believe he is the best one yet. He was funny, eccentric, and smart.  I hope they can discover a way to bring him back for future movies.<br /><br />I rented the movie, but I will buy it for my collection.
B004FGMV0W|3|I've never owned an Avril Lavigne album before, and after hearing \\"What The Hell\\" on the radio I got excited for her album. I went out on a limb and decided to buy it.<br /><br />Frankly I've never been a fan of Avril, not to say that negatively. But I never got into her music really. \\"What The Hell\\" was a song that I heard and loved it, it had a catchy pop chorus, cool vocals and a rock vibe. The song is refreshing compared to all the electro-dance pop that is plaguing the charts recently.<br /><br />That said, I don't really know what to classify Avril as. Is she punk? Is she pop? Is she rock?<br />But judging from the sound of \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" alone, Avril is a pop-rock gal.<br /><br />The album itself is NOT upbeat as I thought it would be, judging from \\"What The Hell\\". It's definitely an emotional album filled with plenty of ballads and mid-tempo songs.<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Smile\\", \\"Push\\", \\"Remember When\\", and \\"Goodbye\\". \\"Smile\\" is the only other upbeat song on the album, and it's very catchy (seeing as it's produced by Max Martin & Shellback). The ballad \\"Goodbye\\" (written & produced solely by Avril) features Avril singing in a higher register, and it sounds beautiful. \\"Remember When\\" is another soaring ballad with beautiful vocals.<br /><br />Avril's voice is very pretty to me, but sometimes she stretches it too far. Her voice can get on the verge of nasally, which is when I'm about to cringe. But 90% of the time she stays in a healthy, beautiful singing range.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone who wants to rock out. This is an emotional, heartbroken album with a couple of upbeat songs thrown in for good measure. This CD gets boring sometimes, there is some unnecessary filler. But Avril's talent does shine through on this album.
B004VSTP4Y|4|I found it to be a good story and enjoyed the series. It was not like you were not expecting the end of the story.
1250038820|5|This book went over really big as a host/hostess present.  Just depends on the people who appreciate this type of<br />photography and interest in the subject.
B000P0J0D8|5|Outstanding music
B00H8C4HZ2|4|Although at times the music seemed to overpower the action, it was very well done and truly gave an insight into the struggles and conflict even within the black community.  An important movie for all Americans to see how divided our country really was on the issue of race.  Forest Whitaker is superb and  Oprah Winfrey surprisingly good in her role as Gloria Gaines.
B001AEF6D6|5|A classic!  It's a buddy film, as well as a modern Western with some T'ai Chi philosophy thrown into the mix!
B002MQYOFW|5|Absolutely fantastic!  Can't wait to continue on with the next book!  It was everything I was told it would be.
B00DURILJ2|5|Enjoyed it.
B0096HIEE2|2|Aside from all the incredibly hot men, this movie was horribly corny. Most of the acting was terrible and the plot was almost nonexistant.
B009JCL58G|4|Some movies have &#34;detachable&#34; soundtracks. When you play the music on its own, it fits right into whatever you're doing. A few songs on this soundtrack fit into that category - the ones that employ the main Cloud Atlas theme - and because I love that main theme, the soundtrack was worth buying, for me. But most songs on this CD aren't noteworthy in my mind, and don't really support a relaxing or exciting or pleasant atmosphere... even though they worked well in the movie. So if you get this OST, plan to do some weeding before you're happy.
B00P42WROG|3|Pretty good book. It's not as exciting as a lot of his bothersome but admittedly I love almost everything that Stephen king writes.
0316055433|2|i am so glad my New Yorker magazine arrived because i couldn't read another word of this book. The beginning was fabulous (story and writing) and i was eager to read more. But then i struggled to read another page! i was falling asleep reading about the repetitive, and borderline abnormal drugging and drinking adolescent antics.  When and where was the denouement?
B00001W9G0|4|The Way We Were is a profound film of two people who love each other but can't seem to make it work due to their opposing political views. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford are movie magic together, their chemistry is electric and their acting is impeccable. I loved how honest this film was, the ending is sad but it's nice to see a romantic drama have a realistic outcome and not one that is wishy-washy or contrived. Definitely worth checking out, enjoy!
B00I6JOBTI|5|Such an awesome movie. It took me back to when I and my brother made our own LEGO movie.
B00CH87HF4|4|Easy to navigate. Has all the qualities I look for in an rpg. It's as good as any rpg for a large game system but I can play from my kindle so I have the time to devote to it.
1400079144|4|This is a fun book.  I recommended it to all my friends who live in the Wash DC area and are familiar with all the monuments there.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Best app ever I think it's as good a floorboard
B007SGM084|5|Love this book. I can read it over and over and never be tired of it!! This is my 2nd time reading the trilogy.
B000FCKGPC|5|I love the style George R. R. Martin used with this book, splitting book 4 and 5 geographically instead of chronologically. It allows the reader to really get in tune with the characters and see them in a whole new level. Once again, I couldn't put the book down and was anxious to jump right into Book 5 at the end.
B000HT3PPG|5|I have every video of this movie made--VHS & CD!--and love them all! This is, by far, the BEST made EVER! Even though I own (too) many copies, I STILL watch the TV version whenever it's on! I've seen the \\"re-makes\\", but they just don't measure up to the original! (I'll never watch a re-make again! Edmund Gwenn is the ONLY Santa there can ever be!) Forget \\"colorized\\" versions! When a movie is made in B & W, the director makes CHOICES about the filming--you cannot \\"improve\\" upon perfection! This movie IS perfection! Don't hesitate in buying a copy--you will NEVER regret it and your children will ALWAYS remember the one, true Santa! The REAL Santa is totally approachable, as is (was!) Mr. Gwenn! Get every copy in the original B & W that you can find! No \\"colorized\\", no re-makes. Those waste your money. Stick with the original--ALWAYS!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Loved it. The book was very exciting and I found that I couldn't put it down. Being a slow reader, I was captivated by it for several days.
B000KDBOKC|5|Do you have Let It Bleed on vinyl? Get this anyways. Do you have it on cassette, 8 track, or reel-to reel? Get this anyways. Do you have the 1986 CD? Get this anyways. Do you have the DSD SACD hybrid remaster? Get this anyways. No matter what version of Let It Bleed you have (and if you are are fan, you have to have at least one copy on one format) get this version anyways. It's a nice upgrade from the standard issue CD, the real value here being the luxurious packaging (huge page of liner notes, bonus poster) and the bonus outtakes and alternate mixes. Granted, the mastering leaves a little something to be desired when compared to the DSD remaster (more tape hiss and bass distortion here) but the mastering flaws are really very minor. I think these CD Maximum releases are a great value, but only if you spend 20 or less on them.
1439110123|3|Anyone who cannot remember the price of gasoline ever being below $2/gallon has probably lived in a time when the Middle East was always considered an area of immense wealth and power. It might be hard to imagine, but it was not that long ago when Middle East oil producing states were some of the poorest in the world. In fact, as late as WWII, the United States was the top oil producer in the world, which helped not only its own development but also single handedly helped the Allies win what was supposed to be the final world war. The history of oil and the impact it has had in the world in every way, from politics, to country conflicts, to corporate structures is profound. The Prize by Daniel Yergin is a comprehensive story of how oil became more than just a commodity, oil has and continues to change the course of civilization.  My full review is located on my blog which is linked in the first comment below.  Thank you
B00F8L2VO4|5|Love love love it!! Great refresher for my very rusty Italian!! Fun and educational! Who would have thought the 2 could coexist.
B004Y1WCDE|3|This is a five star for Plex itself, but one star for how much it costs (the app is free on Roku and Samsung platforms) and that 5.1 sound is not supported on Amazon Fire TV, only PCM. Perhaps they will fix this, but for now it is a major drawback to using Plex on Amazon Fire TV.
B000YENUI6|5|If it was not for Into the Wild and No Country for Old Men, this would be the best movie of 2007.  It is better than American Gangster and Atonement.  It will most likely be nominated for Best Picture and for Best Actor.  Viggo Mortensen does a great job in this movie... a great job.  If it was not for Daniel-Day Lewis in There Will be Blood and sympathy for Johnny Depp, Viggo would take the Oscar.  This is his finest performance.  The entire cast is wonderful!  This movie is even better than A History of Violence... which was another great movie.  All in all, i think if you like Cronenberg's movies, if you liked A History of Violence, good acting, good thriller gangster movies you will love this movie!  This movie is one of the best of 2007 and surely the Oscars will let us know very soon!  A must see!
B00ECU2RGY|4|This movie was pretty good.  I love Tom Cruise and I LOVE anything Morgan Freeman is in.  I would watch it again.
B000W178XO|5|Great collection of music from a great artist.
B00AB7HESI|2|When I exited I lost all of my progress I was really mad do not skip levels
B006885LZM|5|Hard to watch at times.  Very compelling story
B0026P3G12|5|This was a Christmas gift for my cousin from Baltimore.  She had tried to purchase it back home and all stores were \\"out\\"!  Knowing this I ordered it from Amazon and of course they had it!!  This was a good surprise gift for my cousin and she loves it!
B00FMQILBC|5|RoomMates makes the best wall decals...you can apply and reapply and they work great every time.  They last for a long time too!

B00005JPQR|5|Third and possibly last instalment of Robert Ludlum's Bourne series is with us, and fans can breathe easy as it's a deserving send-off. Jason Bourne (Damon) is getting ever closer to uncovering his real identity and those behind the mysterious operation Blackbrier. Standing in his way are multiple assassins, CIA agents and Noah Vosen (Strathairn), a no-nonsense chief operative given an unusual amount of room to conduct missions as he sees fit. Getting caught up in the plot is inadvisable as names, dates and places come at you a mile a minute, and the best thing to do is remember the really important stuff, sit back and let it roll over you. It's the fastest Bourne yet, with the action skipping between Turin, London, Virginia, Madrid, Tangier and New York, all held together by director du jour Paul Greengrass. Greengrass, returning after directing The Bourne Supremacy and United 93, brings his usual hyper-kinetic camera movements and, with the perpetual tension-riddled score, The Bourne Ultimatum boasts a pace not seen in espionage thrillers before. But the praise must go to the writing team, who somehow are able to write multiple phone conversations with the same anxiety as say, a car chase.  If one was to pick holes, it's arguable that The Bourne Ultimatum can be a little convenient at times, but the Bourne franchise deserves a coffee break after making everything three times as hard for themselves in previous rounds. An action movie with brains, this is some serious fun.
B009HV2JT8|5|I have to say I approched the film skeptical thinking it would be cheezy and stupid. Not at all. Great movie. Great action. Great story. Great direction. Great eery dark music. Makes Abe look like a badass. Great theme!! I don't usually remember quotes from movies but this one stuck in my head. \\" Power doesn't come from hate, but from truth\\"<br /><br />there are twist and turns all throughout the movie. I love that type of story line where the audience is guessing what happens next. not many movies stick in my head after viewing, but this one did. im probably going to watching again perhaps buy it.<br /><br />I read some review slandering the movie saying its not historically acurate blah blah. quit being negative and read the title haha. those type of people have nothing better to do but complain about everything and are miserable. now if you like movies. i recommend this film to you.
B00L9B7IKE|3|Not really my type of book but found it interesting.
0060594888|4|As a corporate director of HR for a fortune 500 company, I am continually searching for material I can share with the management staff.  This book was an excellent fit in our learning resources center.<br /><br />While achieving success is rarely accomplished with shortcuts, this guide provides what I believe are important guideposts that will keep you on the right trail. Many people fail to achieve success because they leave the trail for other pursuits.<br /><br />It is really surprising in the business world at the number of people who really do not know what they are trying to achieve. Indeed, I would dare to say that most people don't have a clue as to where they are going.  They are simply meandering down the path hoping for few problems and a warm place to sleep at night.<br /><br />This book stresses the importance of people deciding what they really, really want to do in life.  My only negative critique is that the book seems to define success in financial terms (which is par for the consumer American nation).  As the wiser amoung us know, success takes many forms of which money is only a small part.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and intend to share the wisdom therein with other managerial types within my organization.  I believe the advice is solid and obviously, the author is \\"qualified\\" if for no other reason that his huge publishing success.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.  Michael L. Gooch, SPHR - Author of [[ASIN:1897326882 Wingtips with Spurs]]
B00BAXFECK|4|The book could be 200 pages shorter without all his existentialist vs nihilism philosophy but otherwise very well done.
B005SJIP1E|4|good value, good sound, great versions!
B00H7Z7XA6|5|I've used AMD processors in my custom built PC's for over 10 years.  My recent purchase AMD A10-6800K Richland 4.1GHz processor is fast and stable.  Great performance for the price.
B00PEJG1GY|3|Very bluesy sound.  Not that there is anything wrong with blues.  I don't have the musical vocabulary as some reviewers so I'll leave it at this:  A decent album by arguably the greatest rock band ever.  Unlike most of their previous efforts though, there really isn't a song that stands out.  In my opinion, this has been their weakest effort, but relative to most albums by bands with similar styles, this one is still better.
B0055PGUYU|4|Very interesting and well written, easy to read. Examples very useful to apply in business, which was my need. Useful also to think in innovative ways to influence people thinking in how habits may deter people to adopt change.
B00DR0PDNE|1|Keeping it configured with a laptop was a pain. Seems to be because I oftentimes connect to a VPN and this seems to mess up the configuration. It is then another struggle to get my TV to connect...<br /><br />I don't use it anymore.
B00F8F3J2S|3|Ehh, Gates strikes me as a master administrator, great people person, and champion hurrah guy, however, writing is not his forte.  A lot of the prose seems jilted and somewhat disjointed to me, and I found myself periodically bored throughout the accounts.  It's interesting hearing some of the inside developments, but it's drama that is not at all surprising.
B00092ZMDY|5|One of the best albums the Eagles ever made, even though it was on stage.
B00NGYBMOK|2|NOT SO HOT , GOOGLE MAPS IS WAY BETTER
6305971293|2|&quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; is a fair film. It was good the first time I watched it, but it the other times I watched it, it was boring! That is the reason it gets 2 Stars is for a low  re-watchability factor! The film itself is a great contiuation from  &quot;Halloween 4: TRoMM&quot; where this film picks up one year later  after &quot;Halloween 4&quot; where Michael (Donald L. Shanks) has been  rehabilitated by a hermit in the woods and comes back to Haddonfield, once  again after his little niece Jamie (Danielle Harris). Contains - Gory  Violence, Language, and Adult Situations. DVD - 4/5 - Good DVD with the  works! Good treatment DVD wise to a forgotten sequel. If only Anchor Bay  could've done the same to &quot;Halloween 4&quot;.
B0000B1OFL|5|The film stars Mark Walhberg, who really can't act.  That doesn't matter though because the part didn't call for a great performance.  Ditto for Charlize Theron.  Her acting doesn't matter either because she's so attractive that all she has to do is appear in a scene and all eyes will be on her.  Then there is Donald Sutherland, who does a good job in the role of her aging ex-con father who has taught her everything she needs to know about safecracking. But my very favorite actor in this film was Seth Green who is cast as a computer hacker who winds up controlling traffic jams in Los Angeles.<br />There's murder, of course.  And lots of chase scenes.  One is on the canals of Venice and involves speed boats and gondolas.  The car chases are really good too.  In one scene the cars drive down the stairs and on to the tracks of the Los Angeles subway. Best of all is the plot.  It moves so fast and held my attention so much that I didn't have time to think about how impossible it was.  And of course I was rooting for the thieves.  Isn't that what a caper film is all about?<br />I realize that this film certainly wasn't real and most of the acting was mediocre. But I can't help it. I loved it. It was two hours of pure relaxation.  And I highly recommend it as a truly fine escape film.
B005ZOBNOI|5|The characters speak much more intelligently than any teenager I have ever met, but that was refreshing. And it was nice to re-live falling in love. I enjoyed this book immensely.
B00EMXBDMA|5|A book on how to be successful at things you need to survive!
B008602KQI|5|Really enjoyed and have watched it often since I first saw it. I plan to see more Jennifer Lawrence movies.
B000FC1K66|5|Incredible love story.  Not all love is peaches and cream
B00J8CG6KE|1|Disgusting and way over the top. If this type of movie appeals to the average American, then America itself is becoming average. Lets get back to the wholesome, decent Hollywood that used to rule the big screens.
B000MQC9H4|5|Lighthearted, interesting with Christmas shown in LA and a cottage in England. All star cast. A great pick- me- up movie. Love it.
0783231032|4|1941 really is one of those movies you love or hate and you hate to love. It really is a movie with no plot and character development. It has a ton of crazy and wild characters that are very memorable. The story really isn't important because there really isn't one.<br />1941 is a movie that takes place on Dec. 13, 1941 in L.A., Cal. The U.S. people are worried about another attack from the Japanese. Off the coast of L.A. is a Japanese U-Boat with the dumbest crew ever and one Nazi on it. They end up there off the coast because they are lost and their instruments won't work. Back on shore you have tank crew with characters played by Dan Akroyd, John Candy and Treat Williams in it who are out defending the city. You have John Belushi patroling the skies as Wild Bill and plenty of othe memorable characters living there daily lives in this war time.<br />Like I said it really is hard to try to tell you the plot because there are so many chatacters and so many things going on at one time. There are plenty of cameos and funny antics in the movie. I like watching spoof movies like this and it's funny to see it come from Steven Spielberg because he's made some of the best dramas of all-time. If you were to see Schindler's List, The Color Purple, and Saving Private Ryan and then you were to see 1941, there is no way you'd think Spielberg did it.<br />I was disapointed in the movie for the roles of John Belushi and Dan Akroyd. Because there are so many characters in the movie it's hard for anybody to get a ton of time on camera. At the time this movie was made these guys were both pretty popular from SNL and I think Spielberg really could have ran with them.<br />I was disappointed with the DVD quality of the picture. It doesn't look any better than any of the previous versions I've seen of 1941. The bonus features however are great and the price for the movie is well worth that alone.<br />1941 really is a fun movie. It's fun to see a guy like Spielberg do a spoof like this. Just him making fun of Jaws is great. It's not that bad of a movie and I really am glad I own it.

0062238868|5|Great
159420411X|4|I find s&n highly interesting and rather refreshing to see the Bayesian approach so passionately promoted by a former poker player, as betting and Dutch book arguments have often been used as argument in favour of this approach. While it works well for some illustrations in the book, like poker and the stock market, as well as political polls and sports, I prefer more decision theoretic motivations for topics like weather prediction, sudden epidemics, global warming or terrorism. Of course, this passionate aspect makes s&n open to criticisms, like this one by Marcus and Davies in The New Yorker about seeing everything through the Bayesian lenses. The chapter on Bayes and Bayes’ theorem (Chapter 8) is a wee caricaturesque in this regard. Indeed, Silver sees too much in Bayes’ Essay, to the point of mistakenly attributing to Bayes a discussion of David Hume’s sunrise problem. (The only remark is made in the Appendix, which was written by Price—like possibly the whole of the Essay!—, and  P.S. Laplace is the one who applied Bayesian reasoning to the problem, leading to Laplace’s succession rule.) The criticisms of frequentism are also slightly over-the-top: they are mostly directed at inadequate models that a Bayesian analysis would similarly process in the wrong way. (Some critics argue on the opposite that Bayesian analysis is too much dependent on the model being “right”! Or on the availability of a fully-specified  model.) Seeing frequentism as restricted to “collecting data among just a sample of the population rather than the whole population” (p.252) is certainly no presenting a broad coverage of frequentism.<br /><br />The book is written in a fairly enjoyable style, highly personal (no harm with that) and apart from superlativising (!) everyone making a relevant appearance, I find it rather well-organised as it brings the reader from facts (prediction usually sucks) to the possibility of higher quality prediction (by acknowledging prior information, accepting uncertainty, using all items of information available, further accepting uncertainty, &tc.). I am not sure the reader is the wiser by the end of the book on how one should improve one’s prediction tools, but there is a least a warning about the low quality of most predictions and predictive tools that should linger in the reader’s ears…. I enjoyed very much the chapter on chess, esp. the core about Kasparov’s misreading the computer reasons for a poor move (no further spoiler!), although I felt it was not much connected to the rest of the book.<br /><br />There are plenty of graphs in s&n, which is great, but not all of them are at the Tufte quality level. For instance, Figure 11-1 about the “average time U.S. common stock was held” contains six pie charts corresponding to six decades with the average time and a percentage which could be how long compared with the 1950s a stock was held. The graph is not mentioned in the text. (I will not mention Figure 8-2!)ormation, accepting uncertainty, using all items of information available, further accepting uncertainty, &tc.).

0756686970|5|Got this for my nephew's 5th birthday (he's pretty advanced for his age and he can read well). He loved it because he loves Lego and Star Wars. I read a few pages with him, and the random facts are interesting, and the details were a lot more than expected.  Great buy.
B007SGM084|5|Wow finally a grown up book for women, actually words that are more the 4 letters long and boy can she write. If I could of lost my virginity that way maybe I would look forward to having sex, more then I do.  WOW.
B006LSZECO|5|I hope there's a sequel to this book, because I wasn't ready for it to end in such an ambiguous manner!  What happens next?
B00004Z4WQ|5|Anyone who gave this movie negative reviews must be either 50+ years old, or someone who enjoys their English class.  This movie is packed with so many hilariously funny jokes, you won't be able to catch your breath.  This movie is not offensive to me, nor should it be to anyone in or beyond high school.  I cannot wait for Scary Movie 2, I am confident it will be just as good.  My only problem - should have included nudity of both genders, or none at all.
B009LDCXNY|5|Got it. Love it just like all the rest. Not many shows that i can say that about after 8 seasons.
B00AREIAI8|5|Wow i feel like a kid. Nothing much happens but i can't stop playing. My co-workers are sick of hearing about my horse. Need support group.
B00LZXOI5E|5|I've been playing this game for the past two to three days. It is a very addictive game... I've been doing nothing but playing this game when I'm home... today I do potent the whole day playing it... beware highly addictive
B009NNMBCA|5|First off, let me start by saying that I am not an obsessed teenage girl writing a review for One Direction. I happen to be much older but I really do love this group and I also fell in love with the movie. I think it was raw and real and it really gave you a look into what happens during their day whether they are working or have a day off. These young men are very talented and humble and also very different from the previous boy groups who have come before. Even if your not a huge fan you should see the movie and not judge because these boys deserve all the fame and success they have through their hard work and dedication.
0765325950|1|Overall the book was a disappointment. The story, characters, and general feeling do not hold consistent with the writing of RJ and even BS's previous two books. The real change here is the feeling of incompleteness and inconsistency and emptiness, that really leaves you feeling short-changed and let down. If you are a WOT fan of course you will read the final novel and draw your own conclusions. But if you are chiefly interested in a good read, stick to Robert Jordan's books and enjoy the beginning not the ending, making your own ending is better than the Brandon Sanderson ending, and cheaper.
B004SJ3BCI|5|it was awesome if you need a break from reading have some fun graphics are good and. also controles (the screen)
B000069AUI|4|I was born in the good old days, listening to the old Pink Floyd, the old Alan Parsons, all the good old stuff from the late '60s to late '70s (including The Who, The Doors, Lynard Skynard, Velvet Underground, etc). Yes, from a tender age my brain circuit was already modeled with that music, probably even since I was a fetus (as I recall now). At that time there was little electronics, no MTV, pretty faces didn't matter, lyrics was important, music was important,...it was the real stuff. There was no band in the entire 80s and 90s able to get even close to the golden age. With two exceptions: Nick Cave (and his great band that includes musicians of the caliber of Harvey and Bargeld, for example) and now Coldplay. Enough said. Worth listening and exploring, but I only give 3.1415 starts to this album. It contains one of the best songs of the last years (A Rush of Blood to the Head) but, unfortunately, it is not a conceptual album. Each song is an independent entity, disjointed and without a common motive; three minutes and move on (that is pretty simple-minded and in the spirit of the Backstreet Boys). However I REALLY think this band is in the good track, but not quiet there yet. They are young guys in an age where marketing is everything and I really hope they will not feel the pressure to sell. I think that they will arrive at the land of the masters, a matter of time if they don't get corrupted.
B00000064E|5|As I was reading some reviews from Tindersticks' &quot;Curtains&quot;, the name of Nick Drake appeared before my eyes for the first time. And, for the first time ever, I listened Nick's voice in the now-classic song &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and I fell desperately in love for his music. In reviewing &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot;, which I consider to be the best album ever, I just wanted to express my gratitude to Nick Drake for making some of my days more beautiful.
B003LQ3YXU|5|On the recommendation of a friend, my daughter and I watched the first episode of Season 1.  We were hooked and quickly finished the entire season.
B002UBRFDC|4|A very good book so far.  I had considered buying it in hardcover version, but it's much more portable in the Kindle version!
B00JAC25FM|5|Love it
B000FC2L1E|5|this author has an amazing imagination. She keeps you hooked, wanting more. I don't want the story to end
B00UUKFDCK|3|Overall yelawolf delivers a soulful record sounds slightly better than radioactive but there's better artists outta of bama that have fallen thru the cracks sorry but dirty, rich boy & the last mr. bigg, lil burn one, birmingham j, mr. blue stellar artists but go unnoticed.
B000HF6XPY|5|This movie is good it reminds me of the other Conan movie but named different I liked watching this movie when I was little
B00DVKOYBM|5|It is th  best game of being able to play pool and its so life like with its 5 star quality setting I enjoyed myself threw the period of playing the game
B009RH9FR6|4|I ordered this standing case so I could prop my kindle up and I love that I can do it vertically or horizontally! My only disappointment in that is it doesn't stay put in the slots very well and the angle is still hard for me to see...but it's not a big deal because for 90% of my use it's perfect!  It's great to have my kindle shut off and turn on just by opening or closing the case too.
0545265355|5|Excellent quality. Purchased for my pre-teen daughter and wife after they read the first book (paper-back). This Trilogy set is an excellent gift.
B004UID2LC|4|Update?!!!
0316212377|5|The Gzilt are about to transition from the Real to the Sublime, where they will live a blissful existence in dimensions seven through eleven.  In most instances, an entire civilization must enter the Sublime at the same time to retain individual identities, and this is what the Gzilt are preparing to do in 24 days.  When a ship from the Zihdren-Remnanter attempts to deliver a message to the Gzilt -- a message that could undercut the very foundation of Gzilt society and possibly affect the civilization's readiness to join the Sublime -- a Gzilt ship blows it to bits.  Ever watchful, the Culture dispatches Caconym, one of its Mind ships, to join an advisory group that is responding to the incident.  Caconym is a logical choice since it shares its structure with another Mind that has actually been to, and returned from, the Sublime.<br /><br />Other than various Minds, the central character in Iain Banks' latest Culture novel is a Gzilt named Vyr Cossant, who added two arms to her body so she could play The Hydrogen Sonata on the elevenstring.  Because she once met an entity (sometimes humanoid, sometimes not) named Ngaroe QuRia who has lived for thousands of years, Cossant is recommissioned as a lieutenant commander and ordered to find QuRia.  QuRia is thought to possess the information that the Zihdren-Remnanter were attempting to deliver to the Gzilt.  Also making an attempt to find QuRia is his former lover, Scolliera Tefwe, whose consciousness has been stored on a Culture ship for the last four hundred years.  As the Gzilt countdown to the Sublime continues, Cossant and Tefwe and a number of Culture Minds race to uncover the truth about the Gzilt before the civilization makes its collective journey, a task that is impeded by some Gzilt political/military folk who would prefer that the information remain buried.<br /><br />There is, of course, quite a bit more going on:  political scheming to determine which race will become the rightful heir to the worlds and possessions the Gzilt leave behind; political quarrels among the Culture Minds; military maneuverings leading to explosive confrontations between the Gzilt, the Culture, and others.  All of this adds up to a fun, intelligent, fast-moving story.<br /><br />The best thing about The Hydrogen Sonata is that it is wildly imaginative without becoming too silly.  From the descriptions of alien beings to the wonders offered by other planets, Banks creates a fully realized environment.  He effectively conveys a sense of the age and vastness of the universe, plays with theories about other universes/dimensions that might exist, and peppers the story with a wonderful array of gadgetry.  Not all of this is original, of course, but Banks often uses technology and theory in original ways.<br /><br />I particularly like Banks' playfulness:  the amusing names the Culture gives its ships; the banter between ships' Minds; the quirky personalities the Minds develop; the nettlesome nature of inter-species politics; a dirigible that hosts a five-year-long going-away party prior to the Sublime; an avatar whose head is made of alphabet soup; the fact that audiences other than academics and Culture Minds regard The Hydrogen Sonata (which may or may not be a musical representation of the periodic table) as unlistenable; the snarky pet Cossant wears around her neck; an android that mistakenly believes it's in a simulation as mayhem surrounds it; some truly bizarre sexual escapades ...  and more.<br /><br />The novel concludes with an intriguing moral equation.  Members of the Culture learn that a shared belief critical to Gzilt civilization is false.  Should the Culture reveal the truth on the ground that it is always best for the truth to be known?  Or should the Culture keep quiet to protect the Gzilt from the social disruption that the truth might cause?  An interesting quandary, but this isn't the kind of science fiction that lends itself to deep thought.  It's meant to be fun and exciting,and it achieves that goal admirably.  If I could, I would give The Hydrogen Sonata 4 1/2 stars.and it achieves that goal admirably.  If I could, I would give The Hydrogen Sonata 4 1/2 stars.
B00913DPW2|2|seems like a cool game, but did not run smoothly AT ALL.  didn't even make it into the house - too choppy.  i quit.
B007SSDI2E|5|And HUgh was such a baby!  I loved the way it didn't weight heavily on the &#34;OMG I'm in the future&#34; aspect.  He just accept it and moved on.  For him, from the start,there was only Kate.  This is what romance novels (or movies) should feel like.
B005BGBPBG|3|It is a light movie, good looking actors and keep you entertain! Is not a great movie but good to spend a Saturday afternoon!
B0054JZC6E|5|this is a fun game for all ages. but u have to earn points to unlock games and some games are really hard to pass.
B00004W50Z|5|The Band's third album is just as good as the first 2.  It does have a different feel than the first two.<br />I believe Richard Manuel sings &quot;The Shape I'm In&quot; - or at least it claims that on The Band's website, as well as he sings it in The Last Waltz. I could see how people can mistaken the two voices since they sound so similar.<br />And to another reviewer - Up On Cripple Creek is on THE BAND's self titled second album...not Stagefright (it never did).
B00E8KLWB4|2|dont understand how to play
B0009P5YXO|5|This is supercool!!! When I received this item I was excited to put it together knowing that it was going to be difficult to put together. However, I was surprised to find out that it was very simple to put together!! I've been walking around my house attacking random objects with the sonic screwdriver! I feel like the real doctor! LOVE LOVE THIS!!!
B002JTHFUS|5|I bought this a month ago. This package is really great! It comes with a book with many pictures and commentaries about the album from The Edge, Brian Eno... Then there is a DVD with live footage like the Live 8 show in 1985 and 3 songs from a gig for Conspiracy of Hope in 1985 (Pride, Bad and MLK). Plus, the Pride videoclip in sepia version. Finally, videovclips from The Unforgettable fire, Bad, Pride and a Sort of Homecoming. And that making of the album that comes on the \\"U2 Go Home\\" dvd.<br />The package comes with the album itself and another cd with various B-sides.<br />If you have the Joshua Tree package, you know how good this is going to be.
B007ZI06FE|4|This is an intriguing paranormal romance, featuring vampires, steam cabs, and a very alternate Victorian London. I had a little trouble warming up to the hero--Blade--and found his slang a bit distracting. However, the action was top-notch and the romantic bond between Honoria and Blade was sizzling.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the cast of characters--her siblings and his friends.<br /><br />Fantastic worldbuiling! I found the world was almost a character of its own!
B004JHYRAE|5|It's a well balance, well written book, no pretentious, and brings a lot of useful information, makes you think analyze relationships, what you do in different situation,  how we handle it.
B00CS74W0C|5|I chose to read \\"The Crossfire Series\\" (& especially since this particular package included Books 1-3 @ a very reasonably set price!) Mainly because I thoroughly enjoyed the 50 Shades Trilogy. Yes there are similarities and not a huge difference in the characters, BUT so far the Crossfire Series has had me hooked from the very start! In my opinion, the Crossfire Series is much more seductive and intriguing. Each book so far absolutely deserves the praise received! I don't wish to throw any spoilers out here in Ratings & Review; but will say this much - it reaches a much more diverse demographic AND lastly but not the least - the characters are much more easy to understand and form an attachment for despite some of the more superficial backgrounds. It's the personalities and the world they themselves create that makes this a more enjoyable read! 5 STAR RATING from me, an avid reader of practically ALL genres is NOT given lightly. Ms. Sylvia Day is amazing in this genre and currently reigns supreme. I'm purchasing the rest of the series as soon as enter my review of these 3 books that started it all! PURCHASE THIS BUNDLE or at the very least give the 1st book in this series a chance - so far, they've become increasingly addictive! And it's a wonderful, healthy addiction, as well!
B000000JO3|5|hey the cd kicks ass easily worth five stars and just for the record Thrice is not punk and it never was so some people need to shut there mouths.
B006GKHE6G|1|Broken controls.  Tilt no longer works and touch controls only work on occasion.  Would really like a refund.  This really stinks.
B002GHHHPQ|3|For anyone who is into aviation history, or World War II, this is a very entertaining film with great aerial combat and some of the best footage of B-17's ever filmed.  It also does a great job of showing the dangers of the 8th Airforce's daylight bombing raids and just how tough the Flying Fortress was as an aircraft.  Having said that though the historical accuracy of the plot leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes there really is a B-17 named Memphis Belle (she's currently under restoration), and yes it's crew was celebrated as the first to complete their tour of duty.  In real life the Memphis Belle's 25th and final mission was far less dramatic.  The real crew actually flew 29 missions, 25 of which were in the Belle, and their final mission was over Kiel, not Bremen.  Additionally the characters in the movie are just composites of various arch-types, and bare no resemblance to their real life counterparts (even the names are different).<br /><br />I'd give the movie four stars, but my DVD has subtitles that cannot be turned off.
1567184855|5|Journey of Souls by Michael Newton is a well written, credible report on what the author's patients revealed during hypnosis about what happens to the spirit after it leaves the body at death.  The number of patients, the similarity of the reports, and the decades covered by Newton's investigation all lend authenticity to what is revealed.  Death is a concept that seems to addle the brains of many people.  It's a word that &#34;can't be spoken&#34; by some of my peers (I.e. folks in their 70s), indicating their dread of their inevitable passing out of this tangible Earth life.<br /><br />I always said the word but the ideas of oblivion and meaningless after I draw my last breath--devastated me for many years.  When you read Newton, though, you get such a good, rich, happy image of the soul between lives that fear and dread kind of evaporate.  Now I am not heavy hearted when I think about my death and the deaths of my loved ones.  I bought four copies of this book and gave them to friends and family (ages 44-87) so they could reap the same important benefits.<br /><br />Thank you Michael Newton.
B00OAKTEIU|5|I've read a lot of hyper-critical reviews of this album. Having come late to the party and now discovering ITM. I found this album better than expected and enjoyed it thoroughly. I found myself going backwards and listening to their old stuff as well. I could go into some of the great messages of empowerment, disillusionment and growth etc. etc. Buy the damn album.
B00UTJ9C1U|2|boo no need rewriting the book for entertainment it's can do so on it's own.
B0058VA2U4|5|\\"good to have joey back in studio, awesome release.   no long review needed , just a BAD ASS cd.\\"     Thank you Anthrax!
B009NQKXYK|4|Overall this was a pretty decent movie if you are an Aliens fan... It has a few slow spots but they are in deep space and I would imagine that at times it would get pretty boring? At the other end of the spectrum it would probably be really exciting until $#@! hit the fan.... I really like the twist at the end that helps sum up the the alien race... Thats all im going to say.lol
B003JTHXOK|5|Time-tested formula - that's what Nicholas Sparks' novels has - somebody (male or female) escaping from something or someone, meeting another somebody whom he/she wouldn't think twice about, but eventually he/she would fall in love with; there would always be a villain, whom in the end will be subdued, if not die.  But really, even though the plot is basically the same, this formula is always a winner for me - I could not put the book down, wanting to know what will happen next; it's entertaining; it's touching; it always moves me to tears.  Some selling points for this novel:  (1) Sparks was very effective in portraying how the villain's mind works, and (2) I don't know about the others, but I was still a little bit surprised with the revelation at the end of this novel; it just made all of the pieces fit.
B008NNNF7G|5|If you are fan of classic rock and/or southern rock, this album is for you.  This band is making some of the best music made nowadays.  Every track is excellent.  I played this everyday on the way home from work for 3 months straight and played the Little Piece of Dixie on the way to work.  Just great stuff.  Got to see them in February at the TLA in Philly and they were awesome.  I highly recommend this album.
B00D41AJ7G|5|This game was awesome!  I played through all of the levels in the first day.  I wish there were more.  You really have to look ahead in moves to solve a lot of these.  I WANT MORE! :-)
B00CT2P6VA|5|This is a really fun puzzle game.
B005COO1X6|5|What a scary, intriguing short little ride this story was!  I couldn't stop until I reached the end!  Not too long of a story so it's very easy to read from beginning to end in one setting. You'll want to, believe me. Now, it's time to settle in so I can begin reading 11-22-63!
B00AESN8XY|5|It hard but its really fun xD even though you kill everyone in the world!<br />The hard part is the cure.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|downloaded for my 3 yo because she loves everything about the frozen movie. its too advanced for her but now I cant stop playing it. this is a great game for anyone kindergarden age on up.
B008XX6J4C|5|Really fun to listen to when I'm working, and especially great to have on when you get stuck in traffic.  It soothes without putting you to sleep.
0790749998|5|This was a filled action, and entertaining movie. It had lots of action and stupendous actors. They were great for their part in the movie. They worked very good together. Jet Li is a great actor and worked great with Aliyah in the movie. I truly recommend this movie. If you have not seen it you need to go see it. Jet Li got along very well with Aliyah's father. He tried to help them all the time and risked his life all the time. Aliyah was doubtful at first, but went from doubting to love.
B00DURGZHW|5|Holds your attention it feels predictable and yet things are not quite what you expect up until the end when he sails off into the blue ocean.
B000001DYJ|5|I've been a KISS fan since an early age. Can't claim to own everthing they've released but I have most of it. When they put out Crazy Nights I thought &quot;Uh oh, this is bad - really, really BAD&quot;. I ignored the band in subsequent years but someone recommended Alive III to me and I'm glad they did. <br />Alive III is classic KISS in their natural element - on stage and on fire! It's hard to describe in print the sheer explosiveness of this record. In terms of sound quality it blows Alive! and Alive II out of the water, even though it doesn't match them in terms of content. However when Alive III is good it is purely awesome. The opening salvo of &quot;Creatures..&quot; and &quot;Deuce&quot; is nothing short of thrilling. In fact the pyro going off at the outset of &quot;Creatures...&quot; momentarily drowns out everthing else - now that's KISS! Other highlights include &quot;Watchin' You&quot;, &quot;I Still Love You&quot;, &quot;Detriot...&quot; and even &quot;I Was Made For Lovin You&quot;, which is transformed in the live setting into a disco monster!! <br />The whole record is absolutely stunning and puts to rest the horrible ghosts of Crazy Nights and Hot In The Shade for good. This is the record that will restore your faith in KISS, live or otherwise. This is an absolute must for any KISS collection. Buy it immediately.
B001CTDH76|5|My husband and I did not start watching this show when it first came on TV. We have just recently started watching it and oh my...it certainly is a series worth watching. Will be ordering the rest of the seasons.
B0000C9JFO|5|This fizzy romantic adventure combines screwball laughs with eye-opening student-travel mishaps among the youthful, sexually vibrant cast of characters, who hail from all over Europe. Klapisch handles the madness with delightful cheek, even deploying split screens and other visual devices to heighten the comic tensions. Duris is a winner as our first-person narrator and angst-filled protagonist, credibly parsing the benefits and drawbacks of a future in French bureaucracy. \\"Amelie\\" star Tautou and Godresch provide strong support as the women he must choose between. For a spicy trip to festive Spain, book a room at \\"L'Auberge Espagnole.\\"
B001S86J0I|5|If you're a serious STAR TREK fan, you'll rate this film top notch. Fans who like science-fiction and all others will probably rate it a star less. Tim Allen, Jason Nesmith, Sigourney Weaver, Gwen DeMarco, Alan Rickman, Alexander Dane, Tony Shalhoub and Enrico Colantoni have never been better! This is plain and simple one of the greatest parody films ever made, but again it's only the real Star Trek fans (the Trekkies) who will truly understand all the humor and appreciate it most.
B007L6VR12|3|Wes Anderson's films are an acquired taste.<br />From \\"Rushmore\\", \\"Bottle Rocket\\" to \\"Royal Tannenbaum\\", \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" and \\"Life Aquatic\\", I've seen most of his<br />films with the exception \\"Mr. Fox\\". I've got similar impressions after watching each of his films, light, quirky(including the names of the films), colorful with not much of a story and did not leave much impressions afterwards.<br />This film is no exception.  It has great production design, engaging actors, some from top drawers, colorful and quirky<br />but it is so light that did not make a good movie watching experience, for me.  It was like reading a comic book for children.  Love him, or dislike him, Wes Anderson.
B000B0WODA|5|What an album. I'm addicted to this. It's got a load more material than the first one. Kicks out with The Fallen, which doesn't sound much like Franz Ferdinand because of its distorted guitars, and the riff (which may be quite a huge blow because of its quick key changes on the first listen). The Fallen is an instant classic, one of my first three favourites on the album. <br /> <br />From that track you see the band's style changed a lot. The music is heavier, and now its open to more people. The only issue is the lyrics are even worse than before -- But some are pretty good, anyway, and the music is great too. The guitar and drums on that track are excellent, and so are the background vocals -- \\"Woo-hoo!\\" or something like that. <br /> <br />Do You Want To is a big hit, and it is pretty nice, though in my opinion sometimes the melody is really screwed up. Then comes This Boy, with nice riffs, and OK song. And then Walk Away, the soon-to-be single, with a great melody. I love this song. Then comes Evil And A Heathen, a quite heavy song that is just, in my opinion, a bridge to the next part of the album. You're The Reason I'm Leaving has got a nice riff, again, and good melody, great song.  <br /> <br />Eleanor Put Your Boots Back On is a fun song to play on guitar, and this, as well as Walk Away, has got some Beatles influence. Then comes Well That Was Easy, a classic song, I love the ending. What You Meant is a song I haven't got much yet, I'll talk about that later on, but is for me, right now, kind of another bridge. Then there is I'm Your Villain, good song, I expected more from it but it's good anyway, however, I don't know why the hell did Alex Kapranos say the riff sounded like \\"a Smells Like Teen Spirit kind of thing\\".  <br /> <br />You Could Have It So Much Better is, right now, my favourite song on this album. You can see the lyrics are evolving, and the guitar playing is more noticed here. Great track. I love it. Then there is Fade Together, a song I don't like much, and Outsiders, with a nice rhythm.  <br /> <br />Great album. I love it. I listen to it a lot all day long. I know my opinion on some songs will change, but it'll always be great for me, I'm sure. This is also a hard album to get into, because some songs take quite a few listens and it gets very mindblowing at some points, and the riffs change a lot and there are many key changes. Dude, it took me more to get into this one than into Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great album everybody should check out, even if you didn't like the first one.
B00CWY76CC|4|I enjoyed it and can't wait for an update. I. liked how challenging it was and that you had to think on the solutions.
B005J6LKVI|5|The excellent acting by this extremely talented cast will bring about some emotional (but fairly pleasant) involvement for most viewers.  As said by others, get it and you'll enjoy it.
B00TU9UO1W|1|Amazon, by not allowing Mac users to rent and stream the HD version of this film, you just lost my $4 on this one. I ended up paying iTunes $1 more so I could watch this visually stunning film (which gets 5-stars IMHO) in the high definition it deserves. I don't know why you have this new restriction, but it sucks. Seriously, there is NO TECHNOLOGICAL HURDLE to overcome here. HD streaming across browsers and OS platforms has been standard for the last several years. What gives?<br />I guess I'm stuck having to pay your competitors for content that I originally sought from you. I can't be the only one.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Easy for young and old to play. Would prefer no ads between games .
B00BAXFECK|5|This book has an amazing, sometimes tortuous plot and great character development. I would recommend it to anyone who loves art and mysteries!
B00MENCEAU|5|Too bad I  have to wait until 2016 for the final book
B000000W6X|5|one of my favorite massive attack cds.  I play this one more often than others.  Entrancing.  only a couple songs i'm not crazy about.  I just skip over those.  some of the time.  Just get any massive attack cd, and let it play in the work truck, all day long, at a low volume.  it really sounds good.
B00KVI76ZS|5|It is incredible what people will accomplish when given a clear and prescient vision.  It's also unfortunate the roadblocks imposed by lesser mortals.  This book kept me up reading till 2am night after night. I was disappointed when the ride was over, it was such a thrill. Can't wait to see what comes out of this man / these companies over the next and following decades.
B00LTI5A70|4|works as advertized and does protect while being light weight
B00003CX95|5|Few movies are done with this kind of scope and epic atmosphere. Braveheart takes you back to a time in Hollywood, when writing a motion picture screenplay actually meant something. It tells the story of a Scottish patriot, William Wallace, who rises to power and leads armies of his fellow countrymen in defiance of England's tyranny.  This movie is never short in entertainment and inspiration. It shows that even one person can make a huge difference. William Wallace not only makes a difference, but with his intense, incredible leadership, he changes the world. The movie is action packed from beginning to end. The acting is top notch. And the powerhouse original score by James Horner is the best you'll ever find. Dont miss out on this adventure.
B0084IG8TM|5|Love it!
6300271439|5|Wow! What a great movie!<br />Madonna is really great in this movie as ex-con Niki Finn, a bleach-blonde tart who was wrongly convicted of the murder of her boyfriend.<br />This is a great movie if you want to have an 80's  flashback, or if you are just a Madonna fan. <br />The story is cute and fits  Madonna to a &quot;T.&quot;<br />And those OUTFITS!   Pure 80's  Madonna!<br />This movie will make you want to break out your old Madonna  tapes from the 80's ( You know.. the boy toy years.. ) and dance away.  <br />And Murray steals the show!  Who is Murray?  Watch the movie to find  out!

B009LK6JS2|5|This is the best flight simulator that I have found so far.  The flight characteristics are very good.  With the start of a new simulation, you don't know if you will be flying during the day or night or in the rail.  Very challenging.
B006ZCWTV0|5|Obviously it effected Bruce heavily when \\"Big Man\\" Clerence Clemons passed away last year. But Bruce is as devoted as ever stating \\"Clerence doesn't leave when he dies. Clerence leaves when WE die!\\". This is the last album to be released with his musical imput. Not only that but it features an \\"expanded\\" group. The E-Street Band are one some tracks but on others an array of guests come in and out to such a degree it's hard to tell whose playing on what. In this case that makes sense because Bruce was obviously going out of his way to make an epic album here. One where the production and the instruments themselves made themselves heard clearly and crisply. And as usual he has something to say. His career was defined by a somewhat serialized character sketch across many of his classic albums that showcase the importance of American's everyday working class with the countries better qualities. He gave us the good,the bad and the ugly of this. And always with a lot of good poetry and even irony mixed in now and again. Sometimes however,such as was the case on records like [[ASIN:B0000025D0 Darkness on the Edge of Town]] he allowed his outrage and true heart to run free and let the audience know the realities of his characters that bore further scrutiny. Now thirty-four years after that album he is looking to similar emotions for his new album as well.<br /><br />  Musically this is very much of a hybrid. It has some of his classic E-Street era sound mixed with some of the folk fusion type sounds of his most recent albums. The opener \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\" is definitely classic E-Street and even something of a \\"Born In The USA\\" for our times,only with little chance of mistakening it's intent. Bruce clearly shows his disgust and irritation over our pretenses: still clinging to the idea of being a giving and helpful nation while doing so often to benefit (or at the detriment of) our own. And that's a theme that runs throughout this album. On clangy country/folk fusion such as \\"Shackled And Drawn\\" and \\"Death To My Hometown\\" along with more classic E-Street type soul rockers in \\"You've Got It\\",\\"Rocky Ground\\" and \\"Land Of Hopes And Dreams\\" he extends the theme outward towards once voiceless people who...are now thought not to have a voice and can only snicker in silent contempt at what their world is doing to them. On \\"This Depression\\",the title song and the heavily gospel based closer \\"We Are Alive\\" there's this sense of first acknowledging than overcoming the end of industrial revolutions and the beginning of industrial decay. On the more muscly rock tunes \\"Easy Money\\" and \\"You've Got It\\" there's even a bit of the sense that technique of the wildcat rebellion of the [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]] era might be a good enough resource in dealing with some of these situations.<br /><br />  What all this really boils down to is that this album thoroughly examines the uncertain and often frustrated state of mind Americans,especially his beloved working class Americans,are still dealing with as the era of 9/11 with all the self censorship and culture of denial is coming to an end. Bruce is now entering a world of internet revolutions and Occupy. An era when a call to arms is no longer seen cynically as a marketing tactic and is again begin to have a realistic meaning to people. In all honesty too Bruce is also aware he's entering (or already in the midst of) the autumn of his career. And he can see that settling down into making \\"comfortable\\" music that just rests on his past laurels won't cut it for him. No he's not Bob Dylan. Or Johnny Cash. Or Pete Seeger. But he is part of a legacy they've all left. He's a musical troubadour who carries with him a message from the people who normally exist as this countries living backround noise. And by accompanying this powerful statement of intent with music that's as rich and powerful..well as three of his classic albums put together? Well if for some reason this was the album Bruce Springsteen chose to retire on (and I hope it isn't),I don't think many would be very disappointed.hose to retire on (and I hope it isn't),I don't think many would be very disappointed.

1563890119|3|What happens when a group of mystics ensnare the King of Dreams and keep him imprisoned for over seventy years? <BR>So begins Neil Gaiman's epic, sweeping vision that constitutes the Sandman series. The first book concerns itself with Morpheus's eventual escape and quest to find the accoutrements with which he used to rule his dream kingdom. This is no ordinary comic series; Gaiman brilliantly exploits the sequential art medium to provide us with provocative- and often disturbing- images that underline the thrust of the words. \\"24 Hours,\\" for example, just wouldn't be the same if it was produced as your normal, everyday novel. Actually seeing, in Dr. Dee's eyes, the products of his warped fantasies in graphic form adds a layer to the narrative Gaiman wouldn't ordinarily have. And these are visual characters; Morpheus and the celebrated Death, with their Gothic, ultra cool look are so easily identifiable and indelibly imprint themselves in the reader's mind. Their visual representation also reinforces their uniqueness; Death's Ankh talisman, for example, perfectly enscapulates the paradoxical nature of the wearer, where death is a positive, life-affirming state.    <BR>Notwithstanding the consistent high quality quality of the art (I especially love that astounding, two-page image in \\"A Hope in Hell,\\" where Dream, Lucifer, Azazel and Beezelbub stand atop a summit overlooking all of Hell's denizens, and Lucifer, with the slightest touch of humour, asks Morpheus if he can pick out the creature that stole his helm) and some very good stories(\\"24 Hours\\" and \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\"), I can't help but get the impression that, as a whole, _Preludes_ is a forced effort. As Gaiman himself later acknowledged, and many are quick to critique, Gaiman's attempts at intertextuality fall flat. The bringing in of characters from other storylines (Cain and Abel, John Constantine, Scott Free, J'onn, etc.) gives the narrative a campy, tawdry look. It's a ridiculous marketing ploy thatreally robs the narrative of its uniqueness. Gaiman is at his best when the tenor of _Sandman_ matches that of its protagonist; dark, brooding, enigmatic. To Gaiman's credit, this \\"failed experiment\\" never went beyond _Preludes_ and helps to explain why subsequent titles are so much better than this one. <BR>I think that it's necessary to start with this title, however. The summary of _Preludes_ at the beginning of _The Doll's House_ robs the reader of some important contextualizations and impressions that can only be made by actually reading the book. Despite its faults, _Preludes_ is better than 95% of graphic novels and comic books out there. And it only gets better....

B00FP1NNJY|5|Teaming up once again for another sensational hit is the duo of Pitbull and Ke$ha. \\"Timber\\" is the first debut single from Pitbull's upcoming compilation album set to release in late 2013. It follows off the success of his Global Warming (2012) album, which sampled different styles of music to create club-thumping and dance friendly hits (my favorite!).<br /><br />\\"Timber\\" is no different, except it introduces a new element, the harmonica. It is a super catchy dance-pop song that will have you moving right from the start. I LOVE it! Even better is the wailing harmonica you'll hear throughout the whole track, which gives it an overall country feel. The combination of electronic and country/folk on this song really works as it has been shown in the success of Avicii's \\"Wake Me Up\\" (2013), one of the inspirations for the harmonica use.<br /><br />Bottom line: Yes, BUY THIS! This song has been on repeat the whole entire day in my house because I just can't get enough of it. Before the end of your first listen, it'll definitely have you singing if you haven't already been off and dancing.
B005JE7XW0|5|Very funny movie
B0071XO8RA|5|Thanks Hugh for an exciting and original story. Certainly held my attention, couldn't wait to get back to it each night. A very satisfying read.
B0000029DD|2|I really wanted to like this.  I've heard so many people gush over Jeff Buckley and how wonderful he is and how I absolutely *must* get this album.  I even pretended to like it, because I felt like I ought to.  But, well, I don't.  There's some good stuff here, but, having listened to so much of Tim Buckley's music, I can't help feeling what Jeff did was only a good start.  Tim really knew his voice and did some amazing things with it.  Jeff was a good interpreter of others' songs, but he hadn't quite arrived as a songwriter.  Tim, of course, wrote his share of duds, but he wrote some wonderful songs, too.  And his best ones sound effortless, which is more than you can say for Grace.  Sketches... shows Jeff moving in a really interesting direction, and it's unfortunate we'll never see him fulfill his potential.
B001AVCFJM|4|So I have never seen the tv show or any of the movies, but a kid from my high school told me to watch it and I did.  Wow, star trek is really good, clean, and yes sexy at times which is not what I expected.  The two disc is great because I love bonus features.  Sadly, it does not play on my laptop, but over all, it was worth it

B009NFHF0Q|5|This was my first Neil Gaiman read and I am so thrilled it was.  The world created is joyous, scary, and full of imagination and adventure. I look forward to reading many more of his books!
B00LXLM05I|5|It is fun and u will like intense but fun
0345803485|1|All you hear is how addicting these books are. It was all over TV and talk shows. I got through the first book painfully and as I was reading, I thought this is what has people so fired up?  I can tell you that I won't be reading the rest. I kept thinking that if my daughter read this book and thought that is how a man should treat a woman, how sad. I agree with one woman on Dr. Oz who said it followed signs of domestic violence. It is so unrealistic that it made me laugh at times but hey, all the hype made the author rich.
B00785P2QC|4|Addictive game.  Instructions are not very clear but you learn as you go. Pretty good graphics and sound effects. Recommend.

B00CEZJT2E|5|[[VIDEOID:mo2BM5ILLSPSKWR]]This is a beautiful product for anyone who travels or works long days. You can charge your smart phone while on the bus, train, and plane or in a meeting without looking for one of those hard to find wall plugs. This powerful battery pack can charge your smart phone multiple times or extend the use of your smart tablet. (Please see the details listed below in my test results)<br /><br />It is beautifully designed, extremely thin, small and portable. This is a Lithium Polymer battery cell and it uses a Grade A power cell which will provide years of recharging capability, up to 500 plus times. The battery pack has the power storage of 6000 mAh. It has a standard USB port and a built in Micro USB cable (3.2 inches long) that can both output 5VDC at 1 AMP each, simultaneously. It can charge two devices at the same time. My testing reveals that this battery pack is powerful and effective with the capability of outputting 4813.36 mAh of its charging capacity which is 80.2 percent of its rated capacity which is an excellent result.<br /><br />What I like is that the unit is priced well and it is so small and portable but can really carry a lot of power. It easily fits into your purse, briefcase or pocket. Since it is only 0.47 inches thick (12 mm) it can easily slip into a jacket pocket for easy access. You could recharge most smart phones over 3 times with this power cell. The battery pack is about the same size as an iPhone 4. It weighs in at 5 3/8 ounces and it has a matte finish that helps you to grip it and it does not show fingerprints. I have included a video of this review and I hope it is helpful to you.<br /><br />When I test a battery I do an extensive set of tests that fully charges the battery and then I use it to charge devices and make sure that it is fully depleted when my tests are done. I time each test and document the results as the test progresses. I then calculate the mAh of capacity that the battery supplied and I then calculate its charging efficiency. This process takes from 3 hours to, in very large batteries, about a day for testing. I don't take any short cuts or guess and every battery has these tests performed on it and documented. This is to assure that the battery is tested and it performs well. If a battery has performed poorly I then run the tests again to verify the results.<br /><br />What's in the box?<br />* The Anker 6000 mAh black battery pack<br />* The battery pack comes with an instruction manual<br />* The battery does not come with an AC wall charger.  Use the Micro USB charging cable that comes separate with the unit for charging the battery.  You can use a computer USB 2.0 port to charge the battery pack but it is 6000 mAh and it will take between 10 to 12 hours.  The manual states to use a 1 Amp USB wall charger and it will take 5 to 6 hours but I recommend using a 2.1 amp AC wall charger if you have one.<br />* One charging cable for the battery pack or your smart devices.

When you unplug the stored micro USB cable the LEDs will come on.  One flashing LED means less than 25%.  One LED on and one flashing means 25 to 49%, two LEDs on and the third blinking means 50 to 74%, three LEDs on and the fourth blinking means 75 to 99% and all four on means 100%.<br />* When charging a device the LEDs stay lit showing the amount of power still stored in the battery pack.<br />* The battery pack has a nice matte surface that is attractive and does not show fingerprints.<br />* There are two power outputs and one is a USB port and it is rated at 5 VDC at 1.0 Amp and the other is a built-in Micro USB cable that is 3.2 inches long and rated at 5 VDC at 1 Amp.<br />* You can charge two devices at the same time.<br />* The battery pack has an automatic on feature to start the charging process for your device and it will automatically shut off when your device is fully charged.  It is ideal to unplug your device when done charging to protect the long term life of the battery pack and your device's battery.<br />* Uses Lithium-Polymer battery technology.<br />* The battery pack can be recharged 500+ times<br />* Warranty is 18 months<br />* The unit is powerful and it has an attractive price.<br />* It is thin enough to fit into a shirt pocket, purse or into a jacket pocket at .472 inches thick (12 mm)!

B00OTD72PA|5|This is a fun game to play. I can play with all my friends, and I like to try to go up levels. Levels make a person concentrate on areas with difficulties. This app does help increase brain power. You will start out with five hearts. These hearts come back in a shorter amount of time tree than most games. You can both practice and challenge. You can practice all of the games that are available in challenges. Overall I like this game and play it twice a day.

B00006RU5B|5|They've done it again, (for the first time). Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine have achieved to make the best rock album of 2002. This album rocks! Cornell and Morello are off the hook! Morello's sounds are something that I have never heard before, not even on any Rage album. Cornell's lyrics are the best of the year. He also shows off his range in songs like &quot;Cochise,&quot; &quot;What You Are,&quot; and &quot;Bring Them Back Alive.&quot; I bought it the same day it came out and it hasn't left my cd player. I urge any real rock fan to buy this album because it achieves everything that the bands of today are not really able to. It is a breath of fresh air. BUY IT TODAY IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T.
B0020BUWX2|5|This is a tragic story written perfectly with a beautiful end. Bouncing between flashbacks and seeing everything going on as she lies in the hospital, Mia has to make a decision that no girl her age should have to. Life or death? Having just lost her parents and possibly brother and wanting to give up the fight, but having so much more to live for.

B006LSZECO|4|Just received the Kindle for my birthday and downloaded 1 book before Hurricane Sandy hit. Finally made a great choice. Really couldn't put it down, my husband was getting angry with me for reading too much! This book got me through a week without electricity/heat/tv/internet, although I read it in 2 days. Keeps you guessing, well written.

B006MW3UZW|5|Beautifully written, addictive, a wonderful primer on the attitudes, history and social structure of the period. Engaging characters with skillful casting.  What TV and movies should be!
B00E8KLWB4|5|It's an outstanding game that causes you to think and is not your typical button mashing games. It definitely can b  used to pass the time and is entertaining
1591844096|5|LINCHPIN is a power-packed page turner offering a mind-expanding  invitation to re-invent yourself to meet the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow.  Seth Godin's presentation is equally appealing to the novice and the expert.  Caution: don't read this book unless you are open to making yourself  &#34;indispensable.&#34;  Liked the book so much I bought two extra copies to share with my family members.
B002Q4TKZY|5|First let me say that I own the DVD. When I saw that it had become available on Blu-ray I ordered it. As you can probably tell it is an import from Australia. Because of this, the case is slightly thicker than a normal case. The movie comes as a single disc.<br /><br />The audio/video transfer was well executed, the movie was gorgeous to begin with, and it's nice to see they managed not to mess this up (unlike \\"Hero\\").<br /><br />The only reason for the 4 stars was that the extras are not 1080p and as a result will not play on my PS3 so I won't be enjoying those.<br /><br />As with the original, the movie is in French with English subtitles.<br /><br />As for the movie, very briefly, it is the story of a young woman who goes on a mission to help others despite her own problems.<br /><br />If I were to classify the story, I'd say romantic comedy with a side of fantasy.<br /><br />It is an adult movie so there is some nudity, for those who have not seen it.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, then you already know this, the jump to blu-ray was worth the $34, for me anyway.<br /><br />However, as always, rent it first (as a DVD most likely) and decide for yourself.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This was totally absorbing. Love the graphics, really well done. I couldn't stop playing until I got to the end.
B00BEK6Z7M|5|I really loved White Fire. It was reminiscent of the earlier Pendergast novels that were characterized by an actual criminal investigation and a scientific explanation of seemingly supernatural events. I enjoy Corrie, her character brings a young impetuous edge that works well against the backdrop of Pendergast's self-control. I would recommend it without hesitation.
B003Q6D1YW|4|\\"Catfish\\" is a disturbing, sad tale of a schmuck who is sucked into an internet romance. Though there is little suspense here, you do feel sorry for Yaniv (the before-mentioned schmuck) and more so for Angela, his Facebook friend in Michigan.
B00000AD94|4|The Light constituted my introduction to Spock's Beard. It's good enough that I want to hear more, but not so good that I don't want to hear more... you know what I mean?<br />The title track is spunky, eclectic, and, yes, long. &quot;Go the Way You Go&quot; and &quot;On the Edge&quot; are smaller-scale: less structurally complex and more immediately palatable. However, &quot;The Water&quot; crosses some line with me -- a line dividing &quot;interesting&quot; from &quot;obnoxious&quot;, so I tend to skip this track.<br />The frequent comparisons to Echolyn should be qualified; they don't sound like Echolyn, but I can see some similarities in their brand of &quot;progressiveness&quot;.<br />A good listen. I look forward to their later albums.
B001BC2ZS6|5|Definitely a favorite classic -  Had no idea what the story was about .  The two main characters showed such love for each other in their own way
B00KA7JIII|3|If you enjoyed Fez you will enjoy this. The only problem is It's very short, about 2 hours of game play. The game consists of 10 short but beautiful chapters.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fun<br />Simple<br />Beautifully crafted levels<br /><br />Cons:<br />Short<br />Easy<br />Not enough levels<br />No replay value<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The game is not worth $4 bucks. At the $0.99 it's a perfect price. Kids and adults will enjoy this and will be ultimatly dissapointed by the short duration of this game. Really needs 50 more levels to make it worth 4 bucks.
1402720602|4|I was looking for a book to actually teach me how to build a guitar.  If that is what you are looking for this is not it.  It is however a great book.  It gives some history on he origins of the guitar.  Something I knew nothing about but always wanted to learn a little.  It does give some insight on building such as different bracing techniques and the various styles of classical guitars.  Not a bad read for a luthier or hobbyist that just wants to learn a little bit more about the instrument.  If you are wanting to learn to build a guitar I have been told by numerous people that a book called Guitarmaking.  I have a copy on the way.
B00JPCCJFS|5|great read
B003XF1XOQ|5|Many people don't seem to like this book because it's so different from the first two books. And I have to admit that I initially hated this book when I finished it. But it did the one thing that most books fail to do, it made me think. When I finish most books I feel happy, complete and content. Not this book. I felt incomplete. Which is the way Katniss felt at the end. The ending was so real. I've never felt so connected to a character after a book. It wasn't the ending I hoped for but one that I needed.
B0045HCJGC|4|Hello out there welcome to this review as part of my 20 years ago 2003 in film reviews & it is for Demolition Man a movie that by far stands the test of time it's kind of scary how this movie predicted things 20 years ago & it's kind of like today. You know how we are becoming a really politically correct society. Guns being outlawed Tobacco products are banned in a way like how The Government hikes the prices of Tobacco Products. Unhealthy food is banned in a way like how you have these Authoritarian's try to portion control us. The chips in people's hands like The RFID chip that Obama supposedly wants us to have. I enjoyed Stallone in this movie cause his character comes from the 90's & he hates this politically correct perfect society. A society that acts childish cutesy & goofy. Which if you brought the 90's style back today you know today's society couldn't handle it case in point is with Wesley Snipes in this movie how he easily handles law enforcement. This movie imo is smarter than what people give it credit for. This movie was a big hit came out 6 months after Cliffhanger which was a big comeback movie for Sylvester Stallone. Directed by Marco Brambilla he directed Excess Baggage & hasn't directed much of anything since which is a shame. Stars Sylvester Stallone as John Spartan, Wesley Snipes as Simon Phoenix, Sandra Bullock as Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, Bob Genion as George Earle, Nigel Hawthorne as Doctor Raymond Cocteau, Dennis Leary as Edgar Friendly & Benjamin Bratt as Alfredo Garcia. The story is you start off in 1996 this LA Detective named John Spartan is after this killer named Simon Phoenix he has this bus full of people being held hostage. John Spartan  is dropped into Simon Phoenix's hideout before he is dropped in on a helicopter he says \\"Send a maniac to catch one.\\" He goes in guns down Simon Phoenix's hench men goes into his office. He won't tell where the hostages are at Simon sets his office on fire & you have John take him down & carry himout. John's Chief is mad cause he blew up another building & that's how John Spartan got his nickname Demolition Man. They find the hostages in the building. John ends up being put in Cryogenic Storage for over 30 years as is Simon Phoenix. Then 36 years later you have a very politically correct society the cities of Santa Barbara San Diego & Los Angles were hit with such a massive Earthquake & have been formed into a mega city called San Angles. Were introduced to Lieutenant Lenian Huxley when she is talking to The Chief she talks to him like a little kid. If you cuss you're ticketed. She has a likable character she likes the society of The 80's & 90's sort of like I do. Plus she is unintentionally funny cause she's always screwing up old sayings she has a partner Alfredo Garcia who is another likable character. Now you have a group of underground resistance fighters lead by a man named Edgar Friendly who is fighting the totalitarianism & this Doctor named Raymond Cocteau has Simon Phoenix unthawed to go kill Edgar Friendly some cops are sent out to arrest Simon Phoenix he uses this Information Booth where he can find out where some guns are out & the machine starts tells him the history of guns Simon cusses the machine out & he is ticketed for it Simon yells f  *  *  k you to the machine it's like he's saying it to today's society. The Cops show up they're no match for Simon. A Cop that was friends with John Spartan thinks he should be unthawed cause John took down Simon Phoenix down before. So he is unthawed & John wants a cigarette but smoking is banned & he finds out soon that cussing is outlawed cause when he was talking to his friend who was a Helicopter Pilot he tells John that he was grounded. John tells him \\"S  h  it you were a d  *  *  n good flyer!\\" He is finned 2 credits he goes right up to that machine & cusses it out this scene was funny which he uses the tickets as toilet paper cause that's been outlawed for being unfriendly to the environment. Johnfinds out that he has chip implanted in his hands & that is scary cause of the whole RFID chip. The only place that has guns is the museum where Simon goes at into The Hall Of Violence he's trying to get some guns a guard comes up & says \\"Gee what's your boggle.\\" Some stupid goofy saying like that Simon takes that guy slams him into the glass display case he starts gathering weapons including some kind of Phasar Gun on the way to the museum Lenina & Officer Garcia play the raidio that has either show tunes playing or cutesy garbage like you hear on the radio today.  They got to the museum John  tries to stop Simon you have a really fun shoot out in the museum where they end up in a replica of an urban area 1 thing leads to another Simon escapes he runs into Dr Cocteau he reminds Simon why he unthawed him John gets outside & Simon gets away Dr Cocteau tells John that he saved his life & invites him to dinner to Taco Bell cause they won the fast food wars. Anyway during dinner you have a group lead by Edgar Friendly start a disturbance cause they're going to steal some food John goes out & fights them off he finds out all they're doing is stealing food. Lenina some surveillance footage John finds out that Dr Cocteau was the 1 who unthawed Simon Phoenix. John finds out that he implanted with Seamstress Skills while he was in Cryo Sleep case he made Lieutenant Huxley a Sweater. John wants to know why Simon Phoenix was implanted with more violent behavior while he was in Cryo Sleep Lieutenant Huxley says that he can't question their Savior almost like you can't question The President or anybody involved in Government. John, Lenian & Officer Garcia go into the sewer to go & warn Edgar Friendly where you get this awesome line by Dennis Leary \\"According to Cocteau's plan I'm the enemy. Cause I like to think. I like to read. I'm into freedom of speech, freedom of choice. I'm the kind of guy who would sit in the greesy spoon & think gee should I have The T Bone Steak or the big rack of Barbecued Spare Ribs with the side order of gravy fries? I want high cholesterol. I want to eat bacon, butter & buckets of cheese alright? I wanna smoke a Cuban Cigar the size of Cincanatti in a non smoking section. I wanna run around with green Jello O all over my body reading a Playboy Magazine. Why? Because I may feel the need to okay? I've seen the future you know what it is? It's made by a 47 year old virgin in grey pajamas soaking in a bubble bath drinking a broccoli milkshake & thinking I'm an Oscar Meyer Weiner. You wanna live on top you gotta live Cocteau's way. What he wants, when he wants it. Your other option come down here maybe starve to death.\\" The fact that stuff like food is attempting to regulated today shows this movie is smarter than people give it credit for. Simon Phoenix says that society has became like The Brady Bunch. Simon has Dr Cocteau unthaw his friends. Simon goes after The Resistance. Simon & his buddies open fire on them with the help of Edgar they run Simon off to the surface. John & Lenina take a Oldsmobile 452 this elevator thing takes them up & it busts through the floor where their in an Oldsmobile Dealership. Simon stole Lenina's Cop Car. You have a very good chase scene he has Lenina take over & drive where he can jump on the car that Simon is in. John tries to throw Simon out of the car during the struggle Simon tells John that he already killed the hostages the night he caught him 36 years ago. John knocks Simon out of the car when he gets control of the car it's malfunctioning the car ends up crashing in front of The Police Station. John is saved by Secure Foam which is like a futuristic air bag. Chief Earle wants to John back into The Cryo Freeze. The Resistance shows up which Office Garcia becomes part of The Resistance. The Chief tells his men to get their Stun Baton's out against a group of people that have guns & The Chief calls them weapons of mass destruction. Edgar says \\"We use these weapons to go groceryshopping..\\" Dr Cocteau tells Simon how he is going to have this perfect society. Simon tells him that he is some kind of evil Mr Rodgers. Jesse Ventura who makes a cameo kills Dr Cocteau. John & Lenina go to The Cocteau building they fight off Simon's goons. Lenina watches John's back & shoots this guy dead who was going to attack him from behind. They find out that Simon is going to unthaw all the criminals John knocks Lenina out with a Stun Baton. He goes & faces Simon Phoenix you have this great finish like when Simon has this claw thing grab John. John tries to free himself plus you have this real knock down drag out fight with Stallone & Wesley Snipes. You don't get a whole lot of fights like this anymore. John smashes Cryo Tube freeze's Simon John is swinging on this cord where he kicks Simon Phoenix's head off.  The facility is going to blow up John gets out of there with The Cryo Prison's gone Dr Cocteau dead the future of San Angles is in the people's hands. John goes off with Lenina & that's pretty much the movie. Final thoughts not only is this a fun comic book style movie smarter than people think. You can tell the budget is on the screen you have likable characters good action scenes. Marco Brambilla did a very good job directing. Sylvester Stallone was great. Wesley Snipes was very good. Sandra Bullock did a good job. Dennis Leary was good. Bob Gunton was ok. Nigel Hawthorne was ok. I am glad I have this in my collection I believe this was the 2nd or 3rd Stallone movie I saw. This movie no matter how you watch it is worth buying hadn't seen it in years. So my next review will be 20 years ago Judgement Night.

140053271X|3|Great visibility of the screen under the sun. But the touchscreen is not alwayx very responsive.
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is my ask time fave game I have ever downloaded.  The developers make it challenging.  Love the friend help feature.  You can spend as little or much real money as you want.  Awesome for a free app!
B00IMYSCR4|4|Graphics and special effects are out of this world. Pun intended.<br />Acting, I think, was somewhat limited by script.<br />Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were still fabulous.<br /><br />Clarence Nykl<br />Henderson, Nevada
B00MIA0KGY|5|It was great!
B00CO4GO7I|4|I struggled with his writing style. It was a little hard to get through, but what he was saying was well worth it.
B0054JZC6E|4|this app is very entertaining. however it can be SUPER frustrating becquerel it often does not work. it does give you lots of options of things to do and you don't get bored. I just wish they gave you more points for winning because you end up playing the same one millions of times.
B00BSBR9N6|4|At times laugh out loud funny this book reads like the RomCom it started out as. Don is so hopelessly clueless but so sincere and Rosie grows on you. The supporting characters are great too.
B00G4Q3NDA|5|My husbands hand forged work is in this movie so it was a must have for me.  Clearly was excited to own it on Blu-ray
B0063IH60K|5|I have this game on my home computer and it is one of my favorite. This game plays good and matches the same challenges.
B003LQ3YXU|5|I really enjoyed this show. This season was my first exposure to Dr. Who, and I have to admit I was surprised at how good it was. It is both funny and sad and has a great deal of depth of character. It is so much more than just a &#34;cult&#34; show. I think it will be interesting to see how the new &#34;Doctor&#34; does next season.
B002MQYOFW|4|Not being a reader of young adult books, I knew very little of this book until I saw the movie trailer and read the sample pages on Amazon. I was stunned to find a book that was more than just for young adults. In fact, I think most adults can and will enjoy this book.  What was hardest for me was that I grew up in an area much like \\"the Seam\\" and was taught by my grandmother many of the survival skills that Katniss learned. So much of this book rang so true to the life I had before leaving for college that it overwhelmed me. And, like Katniss, I lost family to the coal mines.  The book may seem a futuristic view of what the world could become to some who read it, but to me, it was as if I were reading about parts of my own life. I can't recommend the book enough and I look forward to reading the sequels.
B007KZY1YY|2|I found this book frustrating. Titillating yes but very little character development and demeaning to women.<br />I bought the second of the trilogy but could not finish it. I found I just did not care about any of the characters and it was very repetitive.
B00DR0PDNE|4|It streams some stuff but very limited as to its abilities. as of now there are almost 10 apps you can use it with.
B00VFTAXUC|1|Stanley Kubrick made a movie like this every day in the toilet.
B00F3W9NQ2|5|Love it
B008NCSZQ8|5|We all loved it!
B005USZYDU|4|Entertaining. A quick read.
B003F3FJQO|5|James continues to write in such a way as to completely captivate you. He continues the Maze Runner Series with this amazing read. I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />He creates some intense imagery with what some may consider to be overly graphic portrayals of... I guess you'll have to read it to find out.<br /><br />Enjoy the journey!
B00E8KLWB4|4|This is a cool game and it is great because you don't have to have wi -ti to use it. Energy can get annoying though.
B004FGMDOQ|5|I found this book to be a wonderfully entertaining read with well thought out characters and an intriguing plot.  At times I couldn't put the book down eagerly reading onwards to unravel the next part of the storyline.
B0088W6IMQ|5|Great series in excellent HD quality. SYFY missed the bus when they canceled this series. I enjoy it as my kids do as well
B007X4ECLY|3|I watched this film with a fair amount of expectation after hearing about it from a few people who went on and on telling me about how it was a glorious throwback to all those great action movies of the '80s and '90s. Unlike The Expendables, this film was supposed to devoid of meta-humor or irony, which was a refreshing idea, frankly. After all, the best B-movies in history were not made by people *trying* to make B-movies. So I rented it, settled in and rooted for Guy Pearce and co. to transport me back to the good old days...<br /><br />Let me start off by pointing out what the film does (mostly) right:<br /><br />1) It gives us the prerequisite badass antihero complete with mysterious past and snappy one-liners.<br /><br />Aaaand that's about it. Seriously, Guy Pearce's character is the only reason to think about seeing this movie. He's tough, cynical, sarcastic, professional. Too bad he's all there is to it. And to top it off, the one thing he's supposed to excel at in the movie--the action--is an incoherent mess. Within the first five minutes, there's a terrible CGI sequence that moves so fast, you don't even get the sense that anything's at stake. One thing that many so-called B-movies had (and I'm thinking of the good older ones directed by guys like John Carpenter, George Cosmatos and Joseph Zito, to name a few) was spatial coherence: you knew where everything was in a scene, where every explosion was coming from, what was at stake. Lockout, unfortunately, goes for the modern action movie method where everything moves way too fast and there's no sense of spatial logic. There is some decent gunplay in the space prison, but nothing spectacular, and not much in the way of hand-to-hand combat. What the movie's really missing is one terrific, memorable action setpiece, something that most of the films Lockout is borrowing from managed to have.<br /><br />People have described this as a blend of Escape From New York and Blade Runner. Well, the prison setting hereisn't as interesting as in Escape (and really, how could it be), and whatever dystopian future exists in Lockout is too limited by the film's low budget to compare with Blade Runner's far-reaching exploration of 2019 L.A.  The main villains are interesting, but for all their antics, they never seem to rise above the level of minor inconvenience, and they're not all that memorable. Nobody here is going to make people forget Isaac Hayes as the Duke.<br /><br />I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But at the end of the day, all we've got is one sharp lead performance surrounded by a bunch of mediocre action and CGI junk. Lockout is a B-movie among B-movies, and no, that's not a compliment.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|I had such high hopes for this book & was very disappointed. Who were all these characters & why were they part of the same book? The whole Tess/Felicity/Will storyline just didn't fit in at all. The way Polly's injury seemed to compensate for Janie's death was lame. Don't think I would recommend this one.
B004NELBPC|1|I have the first Kindle Fire and the old app was great for reading Huff Post.  This one won't tilt in the direction in the direction I would normally read Huff on my Kindle, the list is all photos, like I can't read headlines, and when I touch a photo for the story, I get this small print that I can't expand and make larger.  I used to be able to read a story and easily post it on Twitter and Facebook without losing the page.  Now I don't dare because I have to go to the Twitter page or Facebook page and then try to go back.  I also use to be able to comment on articles, but can't do it now.  I try to go on other news sites on the Web now and ignore the Huff post app.  It's impossible to use for very long and I can't read the articles very well any way.  For what reason, this app wasn't tested ahead of time on many Kindle devices, I don't know, but it makes the Huff post look very bad and drives readers away from it.
B003F3FJQO|5|Just as good as the second book can't wait to read the next. James Dashner knows how to hook a reader to a book and keep them that way even to the end!
B00GY0HJ4K|2|not a challenging game and a little odd as it seems anything goes without a whole lot of rules...ok for mindless fun
B002W5UVSM|2|This book was weird but lacked sense.  It was like read a story that tried to be fuuny but was just sad.
0767020308|4|Being that I have never read the book &quot;Emma&quot;...I cannot say if this film lives up to the standards that I am led to believe of the novel. Regardless..I found this to be a very charming story.<BR>I adored the characters ...Mr Knightly was sooo gorgeous and Mrs Bates with her constant ramblings was a treat. I also found it fun to see Kate Beckinsdale before she became wildly famous.<BR>This was really a fun way to spend a few hours and I would definitely recommend it.
0345442989|4|Every Episode I book I read was better than the movie which inspired it, which isn't saying much. This book is more noteworthy now because it is the first book to deal with terrorism head-on AND 3 months before September 11th. Reading the book today is a bit eerie and hopefully they won't censor it when it comes out in paperback. I wonder if the author James Luceno was thinking of Al Quida when he wrote it. Check out this passage from Supreme Chancellor Valorum on page 161 and just substitute Taliban for Vandron and Elegin and Afghanistan for Asmeru.<br />''I have communicated with the rulers of Houses Vandron and Elegin, who hold sway over Asmeru and other systems in that part of the Senex sector. They deny granting the Nebula Front safe haven. Rather, they contend that the terrorists seized Asmeru from a scant indigenous population, and have been using the planet as a base of operations for raids against ships plying the Rimma Trade Route and Corellian Trade Spine. Wishing to avoid becoming targets of the Nebula Front, Houses Vandron and Elegin have essentially ignored activities on Asmeru.''
B005DJREJS|4|It's much better show than I expected and sometimes I couldn't stop watching 3 or 4 episodes to know what's gonna happen
0375847227|5|I love the trilogy. Got my book last week and finished reading it in 3 days. It was too addicting to put down. Recommended to all young adults as well as adults. And at the price amazon offers, you cannot miss this one.
B004T4LUPW|5|I am running this on my Kindle Fire HD and it works great. It was very easy to set up. It synched very smoothly with Google calendar. It's been solid as a rock and is very reliable.<br />I does everything it's advertised to and is easy to configure.<br /><br />Good job guys, this a good program.
B008WCP2PG|2|I didn't enjoy this movie. It was dark, and a little depressing. I was hoping for a feel good, cheap thrill of a movie. Also, not enough Mathew in this movie. I wish I hadn't purchased it.
B0044XV3QY|5|Bought this for my Grand daughter and she was delighted and loves every minute of it and it came quite fast was really surprised.
B00AAQWMB4|3|I haven't quite got this one mastered yet.  If you like Tetris you would probably like this one except the rules are different as to where you can put the blocks.
B005SS2QXS|4|This is a simple rubber case for an iPhone.<br /><br />The rubber covers the front of the phone on the top & bottom unlike most bumper cases.<br />I dropped it on the carpet from about 5 feet & had no problems.<br />Can't say whether it will protect the phone from a higher fall onto a harder surface but it looks like it will do OK.<br /><br />All the cutouts align perfectly with the various ports.<br />You have to remove the cover in order to plug the phone in to a speaker dock (I listen with headphones & use an iPod Classic with a dock anyway.)<br /><br />No issues with the camera or flash.<br /><br />It sticks to your pocket a bit when you try to pull it out but not to the point of being annoying.<br />Ditto on the annoyance factor for lint attraction.<br /><br />All in all it's a much more attractive albeit less formidable alternative to the Otter Box.
B0094M4R3Q|5|I watched this with my grand-daughter and we both loved it.  It was a great movie about a gifted little girl surrounded by a bunch of completely lunatic family members.  About like most families  - just kidding!.  It was a very happy and feel good movie and terrific one to watch with kids.  It was funny, sometimes a little sad but mostly just a fun to watch movie....
B009NX41R8|4|Cool 60 's film - Burt Lancaster is very cool
B0007KIFGE|5|Great movie excellent acting by Owen Wilson & gene hackman
B00FJTYDKK|4|Everyone from 4 to 40 laughed at this movie.  Not as strong of a deeper message as some animated kids movies have, but more of a fun, physical humor.
B008XG1X18|5|I love the new ideas that people are sharing everyday.
B00PEJG1K0|5|Wow! This is Manson reborn.  While the Album never reaches the cacophony of chaos that is Anti-Christ Superstar, It manages to surpass any of his previous efforts.<br />In my opinion, this is the image that Manson has been looking for all of his career. With each of his album releases he takes on a different identity.  He seemed become confused as to who he was from Golden Age of Grotesque up until this album.<br />If you are a Manson fan, you will NOT be disappointed.<br />My favorite Track? Third Day of a Seven Day Binge.
B00BETX5PS|4|Good movie
B000IMV4IW|4|These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers.   This is not a greatest hits album.  Why so few tracks over 2 cds?  Roll With It, Whatever, Stand By Me, All Around the World, Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, It's Good to Be Free and Round Are Way are all BIG omissions.  Especially Little By Little.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|I ALWAYS wanted to play a racing game like this I never could find any races like this. It's just amazing
B004SCN2F6|5|This app is well supported, provides deep gameplay, maintains a high level of \\"pick up and play-ability\\", works well on several platforms, and has good music. Couple this with the narrative that this builds as you play and you've got a winner here. If you've ever played Spacetrader/Dark Nova, Dope Wars (or any of its variants), or even Elite, to some degree, you'll feel very much at home in this game. If I had a complaint, its that we don't have the cool icon from the version in the Google shop. Rest assured, though, all of the other features are intact. World class stuff.
B00IRMTTPU|5|Great show. It made me realize how inhumane Americans threated slaves. Very sad and embarrassing moment in our past. Amazing watch!
B004JHYRP4|4|Asimov applies the understanding of astrophysics at the time of his writing.  Our understanding has changed but his views only need a bit of tweeting to be nearly modern.  The story is clever (as all Asimov books are).  The story reflects the value in balancing our use of nature to keep nature (and ourselves) healthy.  The tone reflects he 1980s but still rings true.  This book could be cleaned up with just a few words of editing and with just small changes and additions it could be true to the standard model.  Asimov was incredible to be so accurate that early in cosmology and particle physics.  A great author wrote a good book that is well worth reading.
B003Y5H5FG|4|As if the housing mortgage dilemma isn't enough of a bummer, here come the vampires to further sabotage the property values. A pervading sense of isolation informs the opening moments of FRIGHT NIGHT as the camera sweeps into a shot of a desolate Vegas suburban sprawl entirely surrounded by desert. It's an unsettling image. It sets you up for the terrifying stuff later on.<br /><br />This is a neighborhood in which blackened or boarded up windows are common sights, what with foreclosing as the new norm (hey, thanks, economy) and many residents in the community who tend to work night shifts and sleep during the day. So what's another house with darkened windows? Teenager Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) doesn't think twice of his new next-door-neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell), who keeps strange hours and has unsightly dumpsters and debris decorating his lawn. But then people start vanishing, and it's at this point that Charley's estranged nerd chum, Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), begins accusing Charley's charming new neighbor of being a vampire. All of a sudden, Charley, who always did stress out too much, has a new thing to worry about. Especially since Jerry seems to be eyeing his single mom (Toni Collette) and his hot girlfriend (Imogen Poots).<br /><br />Let us not talk falsely now. This remake doesn't hold a candle to the original. Yep, I'm one of them what loves the 1985 version, and so the most telling points for me are that this, er, revamp dispenses with the original's more subtle touches and that Tennant's Peter Vincent doesn't have as many showcase moments as did McDowall's Peter Vincent. And there are several missed opportunities, I think. Sin City itself, Las Vegas, for instance, could've been featured more prominently as a secondary character, that old den of decadence. I can't think of any other place so well suited for vampires. In that sequence in Peter Vincent's posh apartment which has Charley and Amy fighting for their lives, it's practically wasteful how Peter Vincent's collection of vampire-slaying paraphernalia wasn't employed near enough in taking out the undead. And Jerry, our 400-year-old monster, does seem to have an odd way of keeping a low profile. He's supposed to be trying to blend in. What he does after the Brewsters wouldn't invite him in is pretty over the top and something that's bound to attract glaring attention. So that didn't make sense.<br /><br />But those are the quibbles. What are the good bits? I thought the acting was solid all across, although Yelchin may be getting too old to play high schoolers. Colin Farrell submits a more scruffy, more feral bloodsucker than did Chris Sarandon, although he's just as charming. It's a different take, that's all, and not a bad one, at that. (By the way, Sarandon shows up in a cameo as a victim.) Farrell exudes this shady vibe. There's a very well done scene in which Jerry is standing right outside the open doorway of Charley's house, waiting for Charley to lend his a six-pack of beer. It's apparent that he's waiting for Charley to ask him in, but Charley at this stage has got the wind up, is starting to put the pieces together. You can feel that aura of menace just start to build and emanate from Jerry as he realizes that he's not going to get an invite after all. It's one of the best scenes in the film. Meanwhile, David Tennant makes the most of his showy role, playing the boozy and indifferent Las Vegas stage magician who's boned up on vampire methodology. He's fun to watch and his Peter Vincent is very different from his Doctor Who role. But he's no Roddy McDowall. For that matter, when it comes to playing Evil Ed, Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have the impact of a Stephen Geoffreys.<br /><br />I do recommend FRIGHT NIGHT the remake. There are pretty good scares, although, as in the original version, it flirts with the tongue-in-cheek stuff. This plays right in the wheelhouse of screenplay writer Marti Noxen, who used to pen episodes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Maybe the highest compliment I could pay this FRIGHT NIGHT is that it sort of recaptures that cool LOST BOYS vibe. Not that I'm saying this is as good as THE LOST BOYS. But if you see this playing on cable, stop and look. At least these vampires don't have sparkles.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Bloopers (00:03:25 minutes)<br />- Kid Cudi \\"No One Believes Me\\" Music Video (Uncensored Version)<br />- the Squid Man sequence - Extended & Uncut (00:02:56 minutes)odes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.

B001UV4XFG|3|Maybe up to 70% of this film consists of Bella and her vampire boyfriend, Edward, and occassionally his werewolf adversary, lying around in bed or proximate venues necking with their clothes on, discussing such issues as marriage, why they can or can't, should or shouldn't get it on right now, desperately clinging to the PG rating, whether or not the deathless life of the vampire fiend is preferable to human mortality, pre-teen and teen angst regarding the purpose or purposelessness of existence, etc. The screenplay seems to suggest that he's afraid of sucking the life out of her on the spot (maybe a good thing) which will definitely happen if he, literally, gets too much into her.  This A-story or B-story is suggested to provide a certain cohesive tension until graduation night when this event is supposed to commence, but does not.  The school (junior high?) it seems is divided between cliques of vampires and werewolves, excepting the class valedictorian and the faculty, losers who retain their humanity, even in Hollywood. One sits around the school cafeteria with one's respective intimates, vamp or wolf, rapping, and staring down at the crummy institutional fare on the plate, inwardly craving a gut full of good ol' flesh and blood.  Not an unrealistic portrait of school life when honestly considered.  Shakespeare would seriously envy the amount of dialogue packed into this script which deluges the audience in backstory, mercilessly playing on the deepest hopes, fears, and dilemmas of folks between the ages of eight to maybe fifteen, until they either swim or drown. But none can doubt the commercial success of Twilight. The makers have targeted their audience (the bulk of the current theatre-going audience alluded to above) with enviable expertise. Surprisingly, action scenes account for no more than 15% of the footage, rather incredible as they are at that.  The credit here must go to the actors. Ms Stewart is blessed with an expressive, almost Keatonesque melancholy in her eyes and brow which will only mellow with age, an A-list fundament, and she plays admirably to the camera.  As everyone in the world who watches movies knows at this point, Pattinson and K-Stew are beautiful people - which prompts one to reflect on how much more fun, though less of a shameless cash cow, such a film would have been, had at least some, if not all, of their romance had been shot au natural.  But then again, we are, if not happily, brought to remembrance of that special time in life when the passion of love ran higher than even our all too human, inexorable animal lust.  That is, if the two can at all, in truth, be unbound.oly in her eyes and brow which will only mellow with age, an A-list fundament, and she plays admirably to the camera.

0316228532|1|I bought a Harry Potter book years ago, but just couldn't get used to the style, which was, I reminded myself, written for children. This book is written in the same stilted style, with words more usual to adult reading. Where I write 'couldn't' she writes 'could not'.<br />She goes to the trouble, and uses a lot of words to do so, to partly describe the character by telling, and then 'kills' him off. It wasn't until part way down page four that I found Mary was in the car with him. Harry Potter bored me, this writing style, with its unneeded info dump, left me numb, I started thinking about tonight's pizza and what I should do about the crust, make it wider, as my wife likes to dip the crust, after she has consumed the pizza centre, in honey. It's turning cold here, -1°C.
B005NQ94KS|4|Very good movie -- stays very close to the book.  I was reading the book at the time I saw the movie.  It is sad though -- a story of friendship and love and the growth of a relationship.
B000001DTM|5|I bought this CD back in 1997 when I became a new U2 fan since I heard the song 'One' and was completely floored by the fact that a powerful rock band had produced a song like this, so touching and ironic. 6 years after I bought it, this album has grown on me as I heard it almost every other day. The amazing lyrics and masterfully crafted lyrics of 'One', 'Cruel','Acrobat, 'Love is blindness' and the soulful 'Light my way' , 'Who's gonna ' and the powerful heavy guitar-solo driven 'Acrobat' which shows The one and only Edge at the height of his creative guitar playing with powerful drumming by Larry and Bono frantically trying to sing at par with the musical perfection. 'Even better than the real thing' is a strong guitar driven song with the unique combination of techno drums by Larry and synthesizers is amazing.Definitely stands with the other two U2 master pieces 'Joshua Tree' and 'All that you can't leave behind'
1416550518|5|While this story is intriguing and has a nice depth to it, there are other things I appreciated about it, too. I really liked the language the author uses to describe the characters' feelings, and their dialogue: It flows easily and makes it easy to read and feels so natural - not forced or stilted. The move between past and present is smooth and easy to navigate: I found myself as interested in Grace \\"now\\" as Grace \\"then.\\"<br /><br />I really enjoy how many different things are happening on different levels. There is the separation of status levels: the staff, who knows \\"its place\\" and wouldn't dream of crossing that line between it and its masters, and the rich upper class owners of Riverton, and their families. It's interesting how people from both status levels are easy to like, and sometimes dislike - they are all human and all have their own problems and victories and they interact believably and their personalities evoke feelings in the reader. My favorite \\"rich\\" girl is Hannah - her sharp intelligence (you'll love the play she and her siblings put on and how she illustrates her point of view to her father) and ambition coupled with compassion and her willingness to include Grace in conversation is appealing. My favorite \\"servant\\" is Alfred ... I feel deeply for his dilemma - he is given a white feather to call attention to his \\"cowardice\\" for not joining the military and fighting in the war ... he is most definitely not a coward, but in proving that, he seems to destroy himself in other ways.<br /><br />There is the almost-friendship between Grace and Frederick's children (Grace is fascinated by \\"The Game\\" and by the girls' dreams, I think), the relationship and history of Grace and her mother (and the mystery of why Grace's mother quit working at Riverton yet wanted Grace to work there), deaths, births, the war that is going on and how it is affecting - or not affecting - Riverton, plus all that is going on in Grace's \\"now,\\" as a 98-year-old woman who is trying to help a movie being made about Riverton be more accurate.<br /><br />I was amazed at how quickly and easily the pages of this book disappeared ... I could probably rave about it for pages, but to keep it shorter and sweeter: This book is a treasure; don't miss it!movie being made about Riverton be more accurate.    I was amazed at how quickly and easily the pages of this book disappeared ... I could probably rave about it for pages, but to keep it shorter and sweeter: This book is a treasure; don't miss it!

B000023VR6|5|Dr. Dre is the best rap producer and his beats are the best. I'm a white kid who listens to indie, punk, and alternitive, but I'm very picky about the rap I listen to. Dre has it for me. Only Dre, Snoop, Wu-Tang Clan, and Jurassic 5. If I love Dr.Dre, its because he's the best, not cause he's one of those one hit wonder rappers. Dre's 2001 is one of the best Cd's in rap history, and if you want to listen to the best, listen to Dre.
B00ADIT8U2|4|An enjoyable game. Not too hard. not too easy. Ends a little too soon. I wouldn't like one more chapter.  I recommend for anybody wanting to spend a few hours having some fun. I don't play a lot of games. but this one is very good in my opinion.
B000000XB9|5|I love this disk. It takes me back to 1972 or 1973, flying down the backroads with my Dad in his Silver Barracuda. (Yes probably without a seatbelt!) CCR in the 8-track player.......Loved it!!!
B00OKYQZDI|5|VERY addictive. Levels up quicker, lots of fun, tension easer.
B00BUCW54Q|4|Not bad
B0012NVGHU|5|Loved the storyline and the music. Kept me watching from beginning to end. Characters were very believable. Simply put it was wonderful.
B00FX8F6VM|5|This jam is good, and to tell the truth would have been fine with out Juicy J, either way it's a great stripper jam and fun to bump after a fat one.
B001B1UO6W|5|Great movie
B00M4ADWQ8|5|This reimagining of the Sleeping Beauty tale brims with wit and imagination.  It sheds new light on the malevolent elf queen, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie), and cajoles the audience into sympathizing with her.  As clever as the story is it is matched by the film's visual splendor.  Much like Lara Croft a generation ago Jolie was born for this part with her prominent bone structure and pale complexion.  The part demands more than looks and Jolie is totally attuned to the complexities of Maleficent.  A good performance is turned in by Elle Fanning as Aurora, the princess doomed by Maleficent's vengeful curse.  Fanning possesses the requisite wholesome looks and projects warmth and charisma.  Good family viewing though some of the imagery may be too intense for the very young.  My six year old niece loved it so that may be the appropriate age.
B00DF0POXA|4|Most songs on this album sound alike. Very creative album though! Bound 2 is by far the best song on the album. Still an album to purchase
B007WEQ3K8|3|I was very excited to download this app as i love doing puzzles and challenging my brain. I found some of them are fun but others are not as easy to navigate. On a few of the math problems, I entered the answer and nothing happened, there was no enter button to accept my response and no &#34;correct&#34; or &#34;incorrect&#34;  that appeared as in others, it was very frustrating. There was another with matching jewels of the same color and you could see several moves that would work but getting them to move is very difficult and even worse, slow. This is timed and it was very frustrating. A few others had very poor instructions,<br />there are others that were fun to do and i will keep the app and use these puzzles only. I thought this app was perfect for me until i opened it but there is enough there to spend some time enjoying.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is really fun it is a lot like the real flappy bird but it isn't! Actually I don't like this game at all the real flappy bird is way easier than this but you I want the colorful birds so that's why I'm typing this.
B00RGQ4674|5|A show that reflects real adult relations.  Great
B0087HT36U|4|Fun game angry birds style with a twist, love the attack from the front element of the game, I'm hooked on siege hero right now.
B009WUAK2M|4|I usually watch action movies with my husband. So, I know almost all of the main stars/heroes from them. If you have watched those movies, then you will probably enjoy this one. It's an action-packed movie with appearances from all your favorite action stars (almost-I think they have a few more they can add).<br /><br />The little remarks and references to the old movies makes you smile and even laugh out loud. The comedy touch keeps the movie from getting too intense, while still giving an adrenaline rush.<br /><br />One very gross part-you'll know it when you see it. Ewwww<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|4|A wonderful yet sad story.  So much cruelty shown to children by men and women of the cloth.  A story of a child's unbearable suffering who can still find strength as an adult to show love and kindness.
B000JQUKKU|5|a quick read and great way to get I to the Christmas spirit. The fact that's it's free on Amazon.com helps too.

B000007S5B|4|This 3rd Doors albums contains some their most poetic and melodic moments like &quot;Yes, The River Knows&quot;, the exquisite &quot;Love Street&quot; , which is one of the highlights of the album and the moving &quot;Summer`s Almost Gone&quot;. &quot;Wintertime Love&quot; and &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot; are other highlights.<br />&quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; and &quot;Five to One&quot; : Classic Doors !!!<br />The hit singles &quot;Hello I Love You&quot; and &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; may not have aged as well as the rest of the album`s songs.<br />Except of course the weak &quot;My Wild Love&quot; which probably always will annoy me<br />Unfortunately the playing time is relatively short!
B000000OPZ|5|Great album.......just love this band.......
B008YRVW0I|5|I love this game. I've always enjoyed these types of games like Bejeweled and then to create my own fish tank and take care of my fish makes it twice as fun.
B007J4T2G8|5|I absolutely loved it. Great story line!
0141028270|5|Love the Bond books!  I'm old fashioned so the first 4 are the best.
1609611543|5|The subject is wheat, not especially belly.  That it has been hybridized and genetically modified without testing on animals or humans and put out to the public, I find shocking.  Wheat damages our bodies.  This is a must have health book, the most important health book of our time in my opinion.  Buy it!

B000QUCNP4|1|Dont buy this DVD. Not yet anyway. This is a lame bare bones edition rushed out too fast. There will be a special edition with Finchers Directors cut, commentaries and a full documentary on the case released later this year or early next. Great film but they will double dip ya so wait!
B005FFW46S|4|While Terry Pratchett's latest Discworld (and latest Watch novel) isn't quite up there with his absolute best, it's still a great read, and head and shoulders above so much of what is being published these days. Snuff finds Sam Vimes being forced into taking a country vacation to his wife's estate, where his instinctive dislike of nobility leads him into some extremely uncomfortable conversations. This sounds like the setup for a pretty great piece of fish-out-of-water social comedy, and the first quarter of the book definitely delivers that, riffing on men who are kept in their place by their wives, the relationships between nobility and their staff, and even a nicely set-up Jane Austen joke that pays off pretty well by book's end. But that only covers the first quarter of the book; it's around that point that Vimes's Watch instincts lead him to a murdered goblin whose people are demanding justice, and once again Vimes reluctantly finds himself to be the voice of social justice. It's not that this section of the book is bad, in any way - it's filled with Pratchett's usual brilliant writing and moving speeches, and even as the book gets into some dark places, Pratchett remains funny and witty in unexpected ways (I particularly enjoyed his version of a simple chicken farmer). But like a lot of his recent books, Snuff feels a little overstuffed and busy, as though Pratchett has a lot of stories he's wanting to do and not enough time to do them (something I can't help but feel may be influenced by his health). Snuff is a great read, but it never feels focused and often feels as though its scope is too large for its short length; even when I finished, there were things I didn't piece together till I was reading other people's thoughts on it, and that's not a problem I usually have with Pratchett. Did I still enjoy it? Of course - as you'd expect from Pratchett, it's funny, imaginative, complex, and even moving. But it's not as focused as I think it needs to be, and it keeps it from being among the top tier of Pratchett's work.eeps it from being among the top tier of Pratchett's work.
142314189X|5|Gave it as a gift, well received
B00G1TOJ7Y|5|I loved this book , it was riveting from start to finish, we accompanied the characters from childhood to next generation through war ,hunger and espionage in France Germany and Russia. This is a book I will read again and again
B0089EHWQE|5|I could not put this book down. I couldn't wait to finish work at the office so I could get to my iPad at home!!  So beautifully written. I laughed and I mostly cried big huge tears. I felt like I was right there with Lou and Will. Very moving!
B0025X4OYI|4|Nobody beats Ray, it all depends on the taste and the mood.
B000BTJDG2|4|This isn't your typical horror film, so I guess I can't really compare it to real horror films. Gore is almost nonexistent, half the movie takes place inside a courtroom (just when you're getting creeped out things go back to the courtroom, keeping the intensity of the movie at a lower level), and the suspense is minimal at times. However, this movie is inspired by true events (\\"inspired by a true story\\" means lessly based on fact than if it said \\"based on a true story\\"), which makes it twice as scary right from the beginning.<br /><br />At the end of movies like \\"The Darkness\\" (don't see that it is worthles), the few people who are actually scared comfort themselves by saying over and over again in their heads, it isn't real, it's just a story. This movie though, focuses on real events. Throughout history, some people have been thought to have been possessed by demons. Though most of the time there is another logical explanation (and we all want to believe there will be a logical explanation), sometimes there is only one way to describe something: there is some supernatural power involved. Now before I start to sound like a wacko, let me finish the review.<br /><br />This film starts out at a creepy fog covered country house and field. The \\"possessed\\" girl, Emily, is dead, and Father Moore, who had attempted numerous exorcisms, is to blame. A hot shot lawyer takes his case and defends him in court. As the trial goes on, the lawyer begins to experience sleepless nights and strange happenings late at night. Father Moore attempts to warn her about supernatural happenings, but since she is an atheist, she takes no heed to his warnings. Father Moore is being haunted by what he believes is the demon that possessed Emily. Throughout the movie, Emily's story is revealed in the courtroom, piece by piece, keeping audiences interested. At the end of the movie, things are resolved, but only partially. Of course there is no way to actually prove Emily was possessed by demons, though it makes for a great story.<br /><br />What makes this movie scary is that, once again I will say this, it was inspired by true events. Another thing that made it scary was that it happened to a normal girl, no different from any other person. This doesn't come close to being the most horrific movie I have ever seen, but some parts are fairly intense, and it definitley kept my interest, something other horror films have repeatedly failed to do.<br /><br />Overall, 4/5 scary rating, 3/5 intensity rating, 4/5 believability rating, 3/5 suspense rating, 4/5 stars for keeping my interest, overall 4/5 starss, though it makes for a great story. <br /> <br />What makes this movie scary is that, once again I will say this, it was inspired by true events.

B0069GRIHW|5|if you take even jimi or janis or nick drake, by the time they died their talent was only a glimmer of their earlier brilliance. jimi could never surpass what he unleased with 'are you experienced?'. janis could never recover the visceral intensity of 'cheap thrills'. by 'pink moon' nick drake had dissolved into incoherence.<br /><br />even for others who lived on like clapton or peter green, their talent too petered out over a period of time.<br /><br />but not so with the doors apparently.<br /><br />for 20 years, the only doors i had heard was a 10 song 'best of' compilation with all the predictable songs.<br /><br />but recently i started checking out their individual albums and having listened to all of them repeatedly it is my opinion that LA Woman was their best recording.<br /><br />it is edgier and still very inspired. intense and highly riveting. highly musical lean and mean blues rock.<br /><br />the last song in the album is my favorite : riders on the storm.<br /><br />considering that this was their last recording, it is a shame that morrison died. i don't mour jimi or janis, the way i do with morrison now.<br /><br />trivia : jim morrison's father upon hearing the Doors debut LP advised his son in a letter : &#34;to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction.&#34; !!!
B0069G5Z9K|4|It's a cool came, plays well on my Asus Transformer (tf101 running ICS). Nice graphics, fun and pretty much a must have considering it's free.
B0000AQS0F|5|I really missed this show, I am so happy that they released it for DVD! I just hope fox re-releases this show (with the same people) anyway if you really like SciFi you will love this show.
B00005JKQZ|5|Hard to believe to see this professor in the trailer in such a good state of mind after so many shock treatments. He must be a real genius to survive all those treatments.<br />As far as I know, schizophrenia is not curable. A very good movie about this American genius!
B00AMBH70S|4|huge fan of these series but this one missed the mark slightly. I actually didn't miss Matt Damon but the storyline could have given more, ready to see more. Now if you have to bring Damon back to get more, no complaints here. Good quality movie overall.
0143124838|5|Thanks!
030758836X|1|Why this book is so popular is beyond me. Both protagonists are hateful creatures who deserve each other. There is a hole in the plot a mile wide at one point. It is clever with plot twists and changing points of view, but leaves you with a sour taste and no desire to read another book by this author.
B001EN71CW|5|Best investment ever to any fans DVD collection.  1 Word says it all about this series and owning it on Blu-ray.... SHINY!!!!!
B00139W3NE|2|meh

B00005RHGK|3|Arguably, the best thriller since 'Halloween'. Direction is often inspired - a torch illuminating something for the audience that the protaganist cannot see, the out of focus approach of lights unnoticed by another. Other times crass, such as the discovery of the rifled laundry at the diner. The stop-start nature of the action coupled with a plot revolving around a foregone conclusion prevents a head of steam from truly building, but yields other quirky rewards especially in the mordant humour. The background of the director gives this occasionally terrifying film a nasty edge that makes me feel guilty for liking it.<BR>The original ending is included as an extra, and is to my mind subtler and more terrifying than the more explicit ending we eventually arrived at. Perhaps, rather patronisingly, they didn't think the audience would 'get it'.
B007IXWKUK|5|Awesome
B000021Y77|5|A nice break from the average boring flick.  Simple, and easy to watch, even for non-native English speakers.  I originally saw it subtitled in Japanese, which mine is far from perfect, but still thoroughly enjoyed this film.  A nice look at the random nature of life, and how one event can change many others.  Soundtrack is top notch as well.
0140182829|5|The most important advice I can think to offer right now is: read this book.  <br />Second most important advice: if you want more information about &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; there are some great reviews already written  - they provide more information than I will but the conclusion is always  the same: &quot;read this book&quot;.  <br />Third most important advice: the  time you spend reading all the reviews, you could just read the book: it's  a short read but will last forever.
0446310786|5|Read this for the first time when I was 11 years old although its not really a children's book at all - it's a very poignant telling of 2 kids growing up in the deep south during the post depression years.  Told from the viewpoint of the main character, Scout Finch, who, with her brother, are raised by their widower father, Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer.  You get a view of all the various types of people who comprise just about any town in this country - poor white trash, blacks, average whites, etc.  And a view of how these widely different folks cohabitate and how they get along.  You see racism, you see double racism, you see a father teaching his children thru his own example that all folk are equal and must be treated fairly and equally, regardless.  And along the way, you are treated to the antics of young Scout & her brother Jem as they traverse the paths of childhood with their pal Dill, and how they deal with the myriad obstacles all youths go through and the lessons they learn along the way.  This novel is gripping and runs the gamut from laughter to thought-provoking occurences, to the &#34;bad side&#34; of life, to the things that scare us and how these kids confronted their fears.  I have probably read this novel 100 times over the years and it never disappoints.  Every reading has been as interesting as if I had never read it before.  It is, without a doubt, a true classic and contains such &#34;lessons in life&#34; that it really should be required reading in high school and college.
B008RA3X5E|5|It works great! You can always use an extra alarm clock &amp; it helps out a lot. I use my cellphone a lot for my alarm  and I lost my phone, so this is perfect and I will download it on my cellphone when I find it!! Great App People! It's a must have!!
0071752854|5|I am using the ideas in this book for business on the net as well as in person pitches. The &#34;framing&#34; works as well in writing as in speaking.  I have bought extra copies for my team to study. This book has improved my delivery and chances of success in every pitch I make.
B0070Z4M4I|1|Nineteen years and this is how our patience is rewarded? Has there ever been a movie with a better set up for a prequel than 1982's &#34;The Thing&#34;? Awesome movie for folks who have never witnessed the majesty of John Carpenter's original. Terrible movie for fans of the original who go into it with even the lowest of expectations.
B005K17RU0|5|Nicely done and seems extremely accurate. I like the in-depth hourly report for the day. It suits my needs and I am sure anyone would like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I think it's great.challenges you brain.it's so much fun and exciting to play.i would recommend it to all my family and friends.
B001AQO3QA|5|I expected was very nice product, I am satisfied with the product, as they offer, pay the right price, I will continue watching deals, highly recommended!
B00GSAC1UI|3|The Little Drummer Boy which Pentatonix released and is all over social media is BY FAR the best track on this album. Very disappointed that the other tracks didn't compare to this song.
160774418X|4|I bought this because I LOVED Ottolenghi's cookbook, Jerusalem.  This one is really good too (the broccoli on page 42 is really yummy!) but not laid out as well and a bit harder to read/use.

B00BETX5PS|5|Good clean action and suspense.<br />Nice twists and turns throughout.<br />Daniel Craig is definitely the best bond to watch.<br />Would recommend to anyone.
B007SYWFRM|4|I like the creativity it allows to build and design your very own village.  This game is good for young people 5-12 yrs. old.<br /><br />I dislike the time frames in hours for babies to hatch, etc., as though you have unlimited access just to play this game and no other.  It ignores the fact that parental controls may be in place.<br /><br /> It also should be easier to get acorns. It is obvious they want you to get hooked on paying real money if you want your village to look as good as your friends. Resist the temptation.  Earn your coins and acorns the hard way by playing the game.
B005EI86JU|5|Informative and easy to understand. Anything to help take better pictures is a great deal. Great book for beginners. Nikon rules!
B00328G4V6|5|One of my biggest complaints about Hendrix's recordings is their mediocre audio quality.  Even the best recordings seem to have poor dynamic range and muddy treble.<br /><br />Not so on Valleys of Neptune.  Kudos to McDermott and the post production team here.  It sounds like it was recorded yesterday.<br /><br />As for the songs, they range from mediocre revisits of Hendrix's experimental psychedelic vocals on Electric Ladyland, to riveting guitar work, to roots rhythm and blues numbers.  The Title Track is not as gratifying as the hype around the album might suggest, but it's also a forty year old experimental number.  I expect that even the lowest points on the album will grow on me, much as his others have, with repeated listens - much as one learns to admire a friend or lover, even the imperfections.  And the high points of the album grow on you immediately as you progress through the tracks... peaking with \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" and \\"Lover Man,\\" and never letting you down after that, either.<br /><br />I really appreciated the sleeve insert, with the photos and McDermott's notes that give a glimpse into the creative process for Hendrix, Redding, and Mitchell.  It's rare to find anything beyond the CD and a track list inside a CD case anymore.<br /><br />Add to that the sheer awe of the time capsule nature of the album, and it's already a treasure in my collection, imperfections and all.
B001UV4XIS|5|I have the entire book and video collection.  I occasionally watch them when there is nothing else on TV.  While Harry Potter is just a pre-teen book, I liked them also.
B009A3NGF4|5|One of the best I have heard.  Pumps me up.  Love mumford and Sons!  Blare it in my car all the time.
0062080237|4|This was a great game of guess the god. They didn't all age especially well either. Odin, Queen of Sheba, Czernobog, Anansi, Horus, Anubis, Thoth, and even Kali are some of the old gods in this clever and funny novel.
B00ABGEFWC|5|My girls love these cute little pets and just keepet playing with there phones!
B00F031XPS|3|Overall notbad but not worth the price tag paid...Said that, it is true that is a nice documentary of the life of this muscial genius, but honestly I would be more interested in the very scarse and not so easy to find material, unfortunatelly for us there is only bits a pieces, here and there, and the only two main attractions are the extras, five songs in one performance and about four or five of the other, and one full song of the Love and Peace Festival, the rest is just bits and pieces and some of the coments are already released on other videos, IIRC there is another documentry of Hendrix that I had long time ago in VHS, and an official release, that had a lot more information, interviews with friends, and some of the same of this one, along with one performance of Buddy Miles...Sorry just the apereance of the little greedy sister, talking of things that probably she do not even remember, ruined the night for me...
B00HXYKYIE|5|Best book she's ever written.
B004SIIBGU|4|This works great for watching and last minute bidding when not at your computer. I was bummed that it doesn't have the ability to let you pay for won items.
B00GINENG0|5|it is good for little kids it  teaches them how to take care of a pet and having fun  thankyou
B0084B1T8Y|5|I love the jungle book. I have been collecting all the classic Disney films on dvd and just love to see where the story's came from and how much has changed between the book and the film.
B005K17RU0|2|Delete advertising for dates poor.
B003YL4LYI|2|If the next book were ready to go, this (and the previous) would perhaps even be perceived positively, by those of us with time and patience.  OK as background if something were available to move on to... Otherwise, just irritating.
B008YU0AOE|5|great for quick calculations when totallying groceries as you shop..
B00FAPF5U0|5|Yipes .  Way too many hours addicted to this game.  Challenging enough to hold my interest too. five stars for this actually free game.
B007FG9LIE|4|Good story-looking forward to the 3rd installment. First books I have read by Crouch-will continue on with more of his work.
B000P0J09C|5|The movie came fast and was really inexpensive!! It was a movie my daughter ask for and couldn't find in any store!
B007ZGO7EM|5|I really like this calculator app. It is easy to use and keeps a history of what you are calculating.
B00BGIBVP8|5|I'm 37 year old male. Personally, I loved it. My wife on the other hand didn't find it as funny. This movie incorporates some of the real issues couples have to deal with when they turn 40 years old. If you're a guy I would say this is a must see. I you're a woman with a good sense of humor I would strongly recommend it. If you're a woman who is miserable with her own current situation in life then I would strongly recommend you NOT watching this movie because it will just make you mad.
B00MBWMIDW|5|Phenomenal film.
B004SIIBGU|5|I've made several great purchases.
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is a fun game but can be very challenging some levels have taken day and even weeks to finish so patcince in required for this game
1589949811|5|I am obsessed with this game.  I love the design and game play.  The artwork is great and the game gives you plenty of opportunities to strategize.  One of the best I've ever seen.  Sometimes it's hard to keep track of everything going on.  It would be nice if there were some kind of tracking app for iOS or android that would help you along with the stages of each turn (because honestly, it can get really hairy and hard to keep track of everything going on sometimes).
0061092037|3|This is a book meant only for first time Archer readers.  If you've never so much as take a glance  at a story by this master of storytellers, then go ahead take the plunge.  You'll definitely find this an immensely witty and exciting tale of two highly ambitious men fighting for fame and fortune.  As for all the Jeffrey Archer fans, who is like myself, out there you will sadly be disappointed as this is merely like a merging of two great novels that spellbound all of us, &quot;Kane And Abel&quot; and &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;.  Sigh...He has certainly let us down this time
B0045XICB2|4|I don't know if it is my internet that is slow sometimes. It is pretty good. But once and awhile it pauses it's self.
B005PK57IK|5|Love it
B00GT67UUM|5|This is a fun game!<br /><br />hours of fun and entertainment here.<br /><br />I will be checking what other titles they offer.<br /><br />zm
B0079XPUOW|3|Great potential. Too much suspension of disbelief required for not enough humor or other payoff. Three stars since it was a good try and there are a few parts that work.
630463949X|5|This was my first DVD purchase and I thought Mac was outstanding.  I had never seen them before although I enjoyed their music over the years.  Was turned off when one of their hits became Clinton/Gore theme but I have  overcome this because of their talent.
B002PZ1H6E|5|This is a fantastic movie. I never get tired of it. The characters are fantastic and witty. A little sad in a way at one point but still a fun movie to watch.
B00CSR2J9I|4|This Game is so addictive ...fun to play when you got nothing to do. I recommend this game to people who like cars
B00CCMKPO0|4|Robert De Niro, in his freshman directorial effort, has given us a slice of life straight from the steps of Arthur Avenue, the Italian food and shopping mecca of The Bronx.  It is exactly the way he describes it in every detail and that is what makes it feel real...it IS real.  What he does, however, is inject the overwhelming problem of race into the mix and he does it beautifully.  As seen through the eyes of Calogero, a 9 year old, superbly acted by Francis Capra, a young and impressionable boy of that era, who grows up with a double edged sword aimed directly at his life and welfare.  He lives next door to the local hangout of neighborhood gangsters and his father, Lorenzo, played by Robert De Niro, is an honest and clean cut bus driver who doesn't wish to be involved with that sort of lifestyle at all.  He understands all too well how tempting and glamorous it can all look to a wide eyed young boy.  The cars, the money, the clothes, the 'I've got you covered friendships' made and the respect given to the boss of all bosses, Sonny, beautifully acted by Chazz Palminteri.  Calogero witnesses a murder on the street in front of his building and is asked to identify the shooter.  Quite taken by Sonny and his position in the neighborhood he doesn't identify him as the killer and both the police as well as his parents are frustrated by it.  They become fearful of just how Sonny might react knowing that Calogero knows he killed the man and even though he has not divulged the name of the killer, everyone realizes the danger that may lie ahead.  Taking an unexpected turn, Sonny actually offers Lorenzo a position in the neighborhood as a gesture of thanks and respect but he turns Sonny down. Time moves forward and Sonny takes Calogero under his wing and, in many ways, while exposing him to the unwritten laws of their streets, shields him from any true involvement with his lifestyle.  Calogero, as a teenager, is played very deftly by Lillo Brancato and is a very likeable young man.  De Niro brings us to the rites of passage of all teenagers and what happens as the story progresses is the very crux of the issues at hand and how, in the 1960's they were dealt with and solved on the city streets.  This film is not a large one but it is a solid film and deserves our full attention plus a huge nod to De Niro for giving us a film that is very well done in every way.ung man.

0060558121|4|American Gods by Neil Gaiman is at times utterly fascinating and mind-numbingly boring.  The story follows the adventures of ex-convict Shadow.  Shadow is released from prison a day early, because his wife has died.  Along with his wife's death is a death to all the plans he had when getting out of prison.  With no real direction in mind he hooks up with Mr. Wednesday.  Wednesday is on a quest to stir up all the old gods for a battle against the new gods.  This is where Gaiman is his most inciteful.  His examination of American culture's obsessive ways creating in essence a type of religion of it's own.  For a good portion of the book Shadow just seems to blunder around trying to figure out what it is that Wednesday wants him to do.  This book works in little vignettes of exploration of American culture, but as a whole it becomes jumbled.  I found those slices of brilliance were enough to get me through the plodding portions.
B000002KK8|3|Dire Straits' sound is definitely unique and easily identifiable.  Some people may consider that a good thing.  Others will use it as a reason to claim that they suck.  The truth of the matter is, if you like Dire Straits at all, chances are you'll like all of it.  If you don't like any of what you know, you probably won't like the rest. <br /> <br />Communique, the bands Sophomore effort, is really not much of a divergence from their debut.  Sure, there's no \\"Sultans of Swing\\" to knock your socks off.  The overall feel here is more subdued.  The one thing that is the same, though, is Mark Knopfler's brilliant guitar work and lyrical stylings. <br /> <br />If you're looking for an entry point to the highlights of Dire Straits' works, a better bet would be either their next album, Making Movies.  An even better choice would be their fifth album, Love Over Gold.  Both are superb showcases for Knopfler's brilliance as a musician and songwriter and definitely display more character.  That is, the songs are more individualistic.  I suppose they got better at writing good hooks. <br /> <br />Obviously, I am in the camp of those who like everything Dire Straits did, although admittedly some of it is... well... a bit boring.  The standouts on Communique include \\"Lady Writer\\", \\"Angel of Mercy\\" and \\"Portobello Belle\\" which is a nice foreshadowing of the style explored further on Making Movies.  Overall, I'd consider Communique somewhat average with respect to the rest of their catalog.  If you're not a D.S. completist, don't go out of your way to pick this one up.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I enjoyed reading this book which is why I gave it 3 stars.  Yes, it is something of a page-turner.  I had to finish it just to get to the climax and find out &#34;who-done-it.&#34;  But, it is not on par with Gone Girl.  It's failings prevent me giving it a 4 or 5.  Nor should it be compared to a master such as Hitchcock.  Ms. Hawkins may aspire to and strive for such greatness, but she didn't achieve it with this - her debut novel.  And one shouldn't expect her to. The plot and structure are clever.  The characters, however, are unbelievable and unrealistic and their actions and choices are convenient for the plot.
B006ZAZ31U|3|Fearless. Great story of courage. Too much emphasis on religion for me..The exploits of Navy Seals are well covered by the author.
B001M5UDGS|5|It was, I think, about three minutes out from the end of Act 1 when I realized my initial skepticism at this premise (and dreadfully-anticipated execution) was so far from unwarranted that I had unknowingly sat in a completely non-judgemental thrall, leaning a tad forward in my seat, steeped in a glassy-eyed lull, with lips slightly parted as if in a slow dawning realization of the genius and magic that produced this piece of irreverant cinema since pretty much the first word of the film.<br /><br />Simply put: this is a brilliant, succinct, and brilliantly-succinct piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Well worth watching, regularly, at intervals.
B00AG297GK|2|Although there were a few funny parts, there were many unfunny scenes. Since Borat was one of the funniest films that I have ever seen, I went in with high hopes, but this was no Borat. Overall this was a disappointing movie.
B00HY7VU60|5|Takes a turbulent and often misunderstood period of English history and turns it into a can't look away drama. Great entertainment.

1594481784|4|As a fellow author, I've always felt a certain kinship with Nick Hornby. I think it has a lot to do with his rock 'n` roll soul. I only wish I had ten percent of his literary acumen. Hornby inhabits his protagonists as believably as Marlin Brando inhabited Stanley Kowalski. With his classic High Fidelity, Hornby has authored a novel for modern times, capturing a subculture of doughy, pimply faced record collectors who live to know who played bass or keys or sang back-up vocals on what session. These are people I know well.<br /><br />Hornby is also a storyteller with prodigious skills. Effortlessly, he spouts smart dialogue, draws colorful and complex characters, paints vivid ambience, and weaves circumstance to draw the reader into another world--a world of yearning, insecurity, and alienation. I can smell the mildew in that used record shop. I can feel the ambivalent heartache of losing a girl you're not quite sure was the right one, yet can't let go of. I am in awe of this author and this book. I only wish the movie had come within a light year of the novel.<br /><br />Rand Bishop, author Makin' Stuff Up, The Absolute Essentials of Songwriting Success, and Grand Pop.
1582406723|5|Robert Kirkman (Invincible) crafted this smash hit ongoing title, which adds a bit of innovation to the very well-worn zombie genre.  The Walking Dead centers around a cop named Rick, who wakes up out of a coma to find that the whole world has succumbed to a zombie plague outbreak, and everywhere is overrun with the murderous flesh eaters.  As Rick fights to survive and avoid becoming someone's meal, he searches for his missing wife and son, who he soon finds out are alive and well, and with his old partner Shane, who hasn't really taken to this new world quite so well.  And that's only the beginning of when things start to go downhill.  Throughout Days Gone Bye, Rick finds other survivors, some will live, and others will die in future volumes, but rest assured that this TPB is only a short taste of things to come.  Tony Moore's stark, black and white artwork does the job, and his zombie drawings look wonderful.  All in all, if you dig Days Gone Bye, just wait, because things get even better.
B00881VLCE|5|Love it............
B00QROI70S|5|Absolutely love this movie!  I am in my 60's and ordered for grankids....but I really, really liked it.  Saw it 3 times.
B004X75RK4|4|I'm giving this chick flick four stars rather than five stars because, although Sandra Bullock is brilliant in it, the movie isn't amoung the best I've ever seen. The story is about a high powered book editor from Canada whose visa has just run out so she needs to get married to stay in the US. She sets her sight on her PA who has no choice but to pretend that he and she are madly in love. Not a brilliant film but very enjoyable way to spend a night in.
B000002KB8|5|This has to be the best debut album of any band ever. Black sabbath happens to be one of my favorite bands of all time. When you first hear the wizard you can't help but visioning the cover of this album. There are so many extraordinary songs on this album it's a must for any rocker.
B00BEZTMQ8|4|Great movie, a lot more fun than the lord of the rings trilogy, less gazing pauses in the dialog, but unlike the lord of the rings it doesn't quite have the feel of an \\"epic telling,\\" which I prefer, but some people complain about. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the \\"digital copy\\" is a gawdawful UV/Flixster something or other. Just what I need, another app to watch my movies and oh yeah, the download to watch it offline is standard definition. Dear all movie production companies, please stop using this awful service and just use iTunes/Windows Media Player. Everyone has access to those options already and they've been working just fine.

B000TGELLY|4|The 2004 screen adaptation of Homers `Illiad' by David Benioff (who currently is regaling us with `Game of Thrones') is director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One, The Perfect Storm) at his longest.  Clocking in at 196 minutes this Director's cut adds more gore and more sex and a bit of filling in the holes left by the initial edit of the movie (though for some reason the physical relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is essentially ignored...).  TROY is a film worth re-visiting for all its spectacle and costume drama.<br /><br />It is the year 1250 B.C. during the late Bronze age. Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris (Orlando Bloom), the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), to leave her husband, Menelaus (Brandon Gleason), and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles (Brad Pitt at his buff body best), the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans. But they come to a stop by Hector, Prince of Troy (Eric Bana). The whole movie shows their battle struggles and the foreshadowing of fate.<br /><br />The cast is packed with many Hollywood stars and fine stage and British actors including Julian Glover, the imposing Nathan Jones whose Boagrius unsuccessfully fights Achilles, John Shrapnel, Mark Lewis Jones, a very young and very under developed Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, Peter O'Toole, James Cosmo, Nigel Terry, Owain Yeoman (now of The Mentalist), Saffron Burrows, Rose Byrne, and Vincent Regan. The musical score, initiated by Gabriel Yared and finalized by James Horner includes some nice passages, and a lot of `borrowing' from Shostakovich symphonies.  In all it is spectacular to watch and the Director's cut does indeed flesh out more of the characters than the theatrical version.  It wears well.

B00C0ALZ0W|5|This book provides a thorough exploration of remote work. The benefits and drawbacks are provided as well as ways to effectively implement remote work. I really appreciated the real world examples of how the author implemented remote work in his company, 37 Signals. Remote Work is conversational, yet packed with great information based on experience. Whether you are interested in building a company based on remote work, are an employee who is considering working remotely, or even have experience implementing or partaking in remote work, this book will have plenty to offer you.

B002UM5BXW|2|Anthony is a little too proud of his drug use, after a while it gets very tiring. His total lack of respect for his fellow cooks/ chefs makes him seem like a self evolved egotist. I usually enjoyed most of his TV shows, except when he gets into &#34;I know more than everyone&#34; else like he does in book. I gave it two stars as some of it was entertaining. I couldn't finish the book, which is unusual for me.
B00FAIPDAE|4|It is a fun game but you really have to spend time on the game. The graphics are not too great but they do have funny glitches. Be wise with your tokens and try not to spend them all. I think the game needs more creatures from the nether and the prices on some of the upgrades and buildings need to be reduced.

Yes, yes its a free country, but why is your freedom any more valuable than mine.  Why do I HAVE to listen to loud blaring music that is so vulgar it edges on soft porn...soft is a relative term!  Why do I have to read on FB every nasty word and unbelievable phrase that comes out of mouths if I don't want to.  It's there in black & white, it popps up, I don't look for it.  It has become a breading ground for porn, illecit sex, and even probably sex offenders &#34;where to find&#34;...I don't like FB anymore..sorry...

B00MEOD4KI|5|I grew up with the original TMNT when I was a kid.  I watched all the cartoons, read some of the comics, and saw all three of the movies.  So when I heard that there was going to be a new live action movie, I just knew I had to see it!<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />First of all, Megan Fox just isn't a very good actress.  She really is just eye candy that looks good next to a male lead actor.  However this movie is meant for little kids so I guess I shouldn't be expecting Audrey Hepburn levels of acting from this actress.<br /><br />The turtles themselves looked awesome!  They didn't look like a guy in a rubber suit like they did in the original films, but they had a new and improved look.  They were taller, more muscled and they looked more lethal then before.  Their weapons looked like actual weapons rather than just stage props.  The Shredder looked totally badass!  Plus his weaponry was really cool and he looked deadly!<br /><br />I actually liked the new take on the origin story!  Instead of just coming across the Ooze, they were injected with a few chemicals that made them what they are today.  And April was the daughter of the scientist who was doing the experiments and when he destroyed the lab to try and save the world, she saved the turtles and Splinter and gave them freedom.<br /><br />I'll admit these aren't the kinda turtles that are always shouting, &#34;Radical!&#34; or &#34;Outrageous!&#34; or &#34;Righteous!&#34;  Like they did when I was a kid, but I liked the new take on them.  (However we do get one good &#34;Cowabunga!&#34;) They all had their original quirks, Leo was a kinda stiff leader, Mikey was a party/surfer guy, Donnie was a tech wizard and kinda a nerd, and Raph was an angry tough guy.  (Yes he was cool but rude!) ;-)<br /><br />We also had several little nods to the original movies that I loved!  Such as &#34;TGRI&#34; on the canister of Ooze.  We had Vernon as April's sidekick.  And yes I was looking for Irma as well but she never showed up.  The Ooze was referred to several times as &#34;Mutagen,&#34; like it was in the cartoon.  And yes, we had PIZZA!!!<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />This movie was just awesome!  I loved the imagery, the fights were awesome, the voice acting was great, and the plot was very good!  The evil plan that the Shredder cooked up was something that he would have done in the original cartoon and that made me love it that much more!<br /><br />If you loved the original cartoon and the movies, then you will certainly enjoy this new take on a classic franchise!<br /><br />Check it out!ng for Irma as well but she never showed up.

B00DR0PDNE|5|I always wanted to watch stuff on my TV but clunky controllers and menu's were always terrible and really made me hate to use them.

B005OIAFQC|3|OK, to first address the thesis-length negative review: it is true that VNV hasn't really changed much stylistically since they released Matter + Form. But a pretentious review with overly elaborate metaphors that makes fun of the band members' being fat is ridiculous.  I didn't like everything about this release. While the vocals are good, and Ronan sounds like a much more positive and optimistic man than on previous releases, the music itself seems to be an afterthought. After listening to it straight through, I don't think I could have told one beat apart from another if there weren't any lyrics, with a few exceptions. I think I was disappointed in this album because Ronan claimed that it \\"may be one of their best\\".    The final word: if you have been a VNV fan for awhile, like myself, you might as well get this album. It's a good listen. If you're a first-time VNV listener, Judgement or Of Faith, Power and Glory will work just as well.

B003NWS5AO|5|Robert Plant is one of the only rock star from the sixties who remains relevant today; rather than safely trading on nostalgia, he attempts something unique with each new album and succeeds.  \\"Band of Joy\\" is masterfully sang, played and produced for the rapidly shrinking group of adults who still buy music.
B00N6PD3GE|3|Still plowing through this. This author's relentless foreshadowing is wearing thin with me. Too much buildup kept me from being engrossed when the damn ship finally went down. The most interesting part was the description of life on a u-boat.
B0009A1AS2|4|The typical Dream Theater fan will tell you that this pales in comparison to I&W and SFAM, but I'm here to tell you different.  This is not quite as hard as TOT, but it still rocks nonetheless.  The only real slow song on here is \\"The answer lies within,\\" which is a really good ballad.  This album still has some heavy hitters with \\"Panic Attack,\\" \\"The Root of all evil,\\" and \\"Never Enough\\". <br />Never Enough, by the way is a song that I haven't seen alot of people comment on because of its somber vocals, but once you hear the chorus you'll realize that musically, this track alone might be worth the price of admission.  \\"Sacrificed sons\\" is also a masterpiece.  When you see these other people say how reminiscent \\"I walk beside you\\" is of a U2 song, they aren't kidding.  It's a great song, but seriously, once I heard it, I was clearly picturing Bono and Company in walking in the snow.  The title track is long, but if you listen to each part, you get the gist of how good it is.  I'm a person who only likes the hard and heavy hitters, and I can honestly say just about every song on this album is worth your while. No, it's not as heavy as TOT, but just as good an album. <br />By the way, you do miss out on alot if you decide to just get a burnt copy of this stuff.  Buy this CD today.
B00B2064IY|5|Really some of Jimi's best guitar work in this album, such a shame it took so long to be made public. If you're a Jimi fan, you have to get this.

0316228532|1|The Casual Vacancy is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I feel the purchase of this expensive book was a rip off.  This is a depressing book, full of unlikable characters who fight with each other and swear at each other constantly.  I am surprised they have not all committed suicide.  I could not finish the book, because it was such a downer.  I see no redeeming features in the book, and I am stunned the author would write such a vituperative and degrading story.
1400095204|5|This is an extraordinary book, which tells the story of the Igbo people, who seceded from Nigeria in 1967 in response to ethnic violence and formed the short-lived nation of Biafra.  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writes with spare but powerful prose, carrying the reader along with an account of everyday life amongst a set of  people from the professional class in Nigeria who suddenly, and to their own disbelief, find themselves in the midst of a horrifying civil war.   Adichie's main characters are richly portrayed:  the intense, politically motivated professor Odenigbo; his lover Olanna; her twin sister, the business woman Keinene;  Kaienene's lover Richard, a white man who becomes fiercely Biafran; and perhaps most of all, Ugwu, a village teen who is hired by Odenigbo as a \\"houseboy\\" and who eventually become a member of Odenigbo and Olanna's family.  Supplementing them are a host of minor characters who are equally memorable and believable.  I have never before read a novel that is so compelling in its portrayal of the experience of war for the civilians who are affected by it.
B008YWY0HK|5|I loved the story. My granddaughter and and I have watched it a couple of times. I passed on to my daughters it watch with their daughters
B0051ANPZQ|5|I \\"wonder\\" how does this particular author write such a good book? I love how there's a lesson at the end: Even though they are bullies in the world, there are the people who aren't bystanders and who show there face to the world. You can make people feel that they are allowed instead of talking about them behind there back. I don't think there's any point in the story where I got bored. I loved it and I would recommend this particular book to 3rd or 4th graders and up.

B004OZOTSQ|4|I've had this app for a while now but never used it. I actually thought it works in a way that I can browse remote files FROM my tab not the other way round. However, I could still use it the way I needed it. I wanted to transfer new videos to the SD card in my tablet (ASUS TF101). I saw that I can easily upload the files using WiFi File Explorer PRO and a web browser. That's all I needed it for and it did a great job. I guess people that are worried about security have a point though.

0553386794|1|This rant is spoiler-free and covers A Game of Thrones through A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />Last night, I finished the last 23 pages of A Feast for Crows, book 4 in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice in Fire series. I said to my roommate Andrea, before going to bed, that I had 23 pages to go and that my friend Todd had mentioned one of the characters who he had hated in the beginning of the series actually becoming interesting later on in the series. I shook the book at Andrea and cried, \\"WHEN?!\\" I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if you can barely remain awake during the last 23 pages of book 4 of a supposedly great series, maybe it's not such a great series. I really, really disliked book 1, A Game of Thrones. But, Andrea had read it and loved it. Todd had read it and loved it. Seemingly everyone in the world read it and loved it. So, I thought there must be something wrong with me. I just wasn't getting what was so great. Perhaps I hadn't really applied myself. I spoke to my friend Scott S., who said that he has tried to read the first book three or four times and could not get through it (HOORAY, I'm not alone!). He said that a coworker of his read the series and loved it, but claimed that book 2, A Clash of Kings, is where things really get going. WRONG. WRONG WRONG WRONG. And while I will agree that book 4 is the weakest of the series, it's just more of the same s***, only with less interesting characters! Books 1-4 focus on eleventy-billion characters. Every chapter you switch characters. So, you spend roughly 20-30 pages with a character and then hundreds of pages later, you return to that character. Sometimes, a minor character is introduced in that one chapter that you read several hundred pages ago. When you return to the main person in that chapter, you're goddamned lucky if you remember who the minor character was who was introduced way back when. You're already juggling so many characters, so many plotlines, you just can't retain anything else. And then, with so many of the characters, instead of any real action happening, you just end up trudging through repeats of the same old boring internal monologue that he or she has been having since FOREVER. And then, as a reward for reading that boring s*** over and over, they get killed, having accomplished jack s***. Thank you, Mr. Martin! I don't even understand how anyone gets attached to characters in this series because you don't get to spend any time with them and then when you do, it's more of the same boring s***.<br /><br />Last night, when I managed to finish the last 23 pages, I got to George R. R. Martin's cute little p.s. I have replaced character names with \\"X\\" because some of you are still trudging through the series and I'd hate to spoil it for you by letting you know someone has not yet been killed. The editor notes are mine.<br /><br />\\"`Hey, wait a minute!' some of you may be saying about now. `Wait a minute, wait a minute! Where's X and the X? Where's X? We hardly saw X. That can't be all of it...'<br /><br />Well, no. There's more to come. Another book as big as this one. [ed. What a shock!]<br /><br />I did not forget to write about the other characters. Far from it. I wrote lots about them. Pages and pages and pages. Chapters and more chapters. I was still writing when it dawned on me that the book had become too big to publish in a single volume... and I wasn't close to finished yet. To tell all of the story that I wanted to tell, I was going to have to cut the book in two.<br /><br />The simplest way to do that would have been to take what I had, chop it in half around the middle, and end with `To Be Continued.' The more I thought about that, however, the more I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters rather than half the story for all the characters. So that's the route I chose to take. [ed. What the hell is he talking about? This entire series is one endless To Be Continued! The only resolution you ever get is when someone f***ing dies! And were the readers really better served by a book focusing almost exclusively on the most boring and/or loathsome characters? Not that it made much difference to me, since I found the other 3 books boring and endless, too. As I mentioned previously, this one just had the added bonus of less interesting characters. Hooray!]<br /><br />X, X, X, X and X, X, and all the rest of the characters you love or love to hate will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons, which will focus on events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present book focused on King's Landing.\\"<br /><br />- George R. R. Martin, June 2005<br /><br />That's right. He wrote that afterward in June of TWO THOUSAND FIVE. He predicted a release date of 2006. Guess when A Dance with Dragons came out? That's right, never! Martin recently confirmed a July 2011 release date. And he's STILL writing the goddamned thing.<br /><br />At some point when I was wading through this series, Andrea said she thought book 4 was the last book and I showed her that A Dance with Dragons was still to come. Then, in commentary on my friend Jason B's FB conversation about the release date, I said, \\"Is book 5 supposed to be the last one? Because if that's what he says, I DON'T BELIEVE HIM!\\" A friend of Jason's said, \\"The 6th one is supposed to be the last.\\" Yah, right. Then I read that there are supposed to be SEVEN. SEVEN! SEVEN endless books! Jason said last night that maybe Martin was \\"building up to something supremely awesome.\\" And I said, \\"I'm sorry, but if it takes you 6 books (and I still don't believe that will be the end, nor that he will ever actually complete the series) to build up to something supremely awesome, you're doing it wrong.\\"<br /><br />George R. R. Martin wrote a beautiful novella called A Song for Lya. It won the Hugo for Best Novella in 1975. I am having trouble reconciling that Martin, the one who could tell a powerful story in a short span of time, with this Martin, who can't seem to finish a story EVER, let alone make me actually care about the characters or what's happening. I have been tempted to go back and read A Song for Lya again, but I'm afraid that my current feelings for Martin will completely ruin the A Song for Lya experience.<br /><br />My friend Scott S. mentioned some other series whose universe was supposed to be richly realized. Scott said something along these lines: it couldn't help but be a richly realized universe because the author described every goddamned cobblestone in every street.<br /><br />Everyone keeps saying how masterful the Martin series is and, in my opinion, the only masterful stroke is Martin's inexplicable ability to keep a**holes reading it. Even a**holes like me, who hate the whole goddamned series. There were probably at least 400 times where I would stop reading mid-sentence, take a deep breath and think, \\"F*** this. I DON'T GIVE A S***.\\" And I didn't. I truly didn't care what happened to anyone. And then, inexplicably, I would keep reading. After a certain point, it became this masochistic challenge. I didn't want this series to defeat me. I WANTED to understand the allure. But, nearly 4000 pages later, I failed. And after my mini-rant last night, and after finishing book 4, I was so tired, so broken, my soul so completely crushed, I couldn't bear to write about it this morning. As you can see, I got over it. However, I am DONE with this f***ing series. Lucky for me, Martin isn't even done writing book 5 and even if I WANTED to read book 5, I wouldn't remember most of the characters by the time it came out and there is no way in hell I would ever go back and read books 1-4 again to refresh my memory.<br /><br />I want to punch George R. R. Martin in the face. And then I want to punch myself in the face for sticking with this goddamned series for so long.<br /><br />Final thought: Just because it's epic doesn't mean it's good.finish a story EVER, let alone make me actually care about the characters or what's happening.

B0074PNCRM|5|I read this because my young teens were reading it and talking about it.  So I didn't expect to be so engrossed, confronted, moved, reminded, and devastated by this beautiful, empowering, tragic book.  Author John Green weaves a sensitive story of young love, sex and death, without sentimentality, and with just an edge of cruelty towards his characters.  A mature read for young adults.

B000059H99|3|This review is for the 2001 MGM Special Edition DVD release.    I just recently saw the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD 28 years later after seeing it in the theater.  When I saw it in the theater as a senior in high school in 1977, it seemed exhilarating and inspiring.  Perhaps it was because it was art imititating real life: a virtual unknown actor makes an Oscar winning film against all odds.     Seeing the DVD in 2005, it lacked a lot of punch, credibility and it seemed very hard to connect to the characters.  The first thing that stood out for me was how much of a neanderthal the Rocky character was played by Sylvester Stallone.  The rest of the characters from his neighborhood were not that far behind on the IQ scale either and the dialogue was dreadfully painful and boring to sit through.  Then there was the preposterous premise of an old, washed up boxer who fights in a recreational center of a neighborhood church getting a shot at a world title fight.  The only truly great segment in this film is the last 25 minutes which includes the classic training scene through the streets and landmarks of Philadelphia complemented the outstanding music of Bill Conti playing the Rocky Theme.  The final fight scenes also hold up well and the outcome does have it merits since it bucked a predictable ending.  Perhaps its the four mediocre and unneeded sequels that may have subconsciously poisoned my enjoyment of this film recently.     The DVD transfer lacked the razor sharpness one is used to seeing on DVD.  Perhaps it was because it was a low budget film and the master copy lacked sharpness.  If you've never seen it, it's worth a watch, but don't buy the DVD, rent it.        Movie: C+     DVD Quality: B+
B009ZQ8FQG|5|It's been very interesting watching the development of the characters (some more than others). Unfortunately there isn't much attention given to some and it seems to take place behind the scenes (Daisy, for instance). But the mellowing of both Thomas and Mary, and finally the wising-up of Robert (that took long enough!) have been most interesting to watch. I was really saddened and disappointed by the death of Matthew but I guess that is how the British handle an actor's leaving. Just too much after losing Sybil, however!
B00A8ECU24|4|Cute - if you like MLP you'll want to look into this. Not much different than any other city planning game.
B003G4W49C|5|I really liked the book. I felt most of the storytelling was consistent, and you quickly get sucked into it. Ended is a character that is attractive for both being extraordinary AND ordinary. I hope the next book is equally great!
B00JLJ0Y2U|5|LOVE....LOVE
B000RLFBP6|5|When this movie was first released I thought that given the title it was going to be a bad movie. This was so wrong. This is a great movie for the time that it was made. The special effects are a bit weak at times, but the story is great. The robot is great. The acting is OK but the action keeps it moving and fun.
B0018Q6RXO|5|Always loved this album. Bought use vinyl for that feel of nostalgia.  I already owned these albums on CD.  They sound even better on vinyl.
B001THZAAI|5|I watched this movie in Germany with some classmates, and I really enjoyed it!  For one of my first memorable French films I found it to be really funny and entertaining.  If I were to watch a foreign film other than German, I am usually more interested in the Eastern European and Asian video world; But lately I have been watching more western movies and seeing this movie on the side bar brought back a lot of fun memories.  I highly recommend this movie for a good laugh with some friends.
B0073RSVMC|5|Purchased this for my nephew as a Christmas gift - he's 8 and LOVES IT!
B005NPLXJ4|4|Art is a matter of taste.  I don't really consider the end result to be music in the traditional sense, but anger-fueled poetry set to a musical background.    And seriously people... WTF did you expect?  Its F'ing LOU REED.    Would the negative reviewers go see a Henry Rollins spoken word show and then complain that all he did is talk and didn't play any Black Flag songs?  If you said yes please leave NOW.  This is not your album.  Seriously, people need to check their expectations.  This isn't a Metallica album.  Its not a Lou Reed album.  Its not claiming to be either.  Its a unique PROJECT and it needs to be appreciated for what it is, not attacked for failing to live up to something its not.
B00003CXDD|4|Willow is one of those movies that takes you back in time to when you were innocent and still believed in a world of magic.  It is the latest in a string of 80's adventure movies brought to DVD and is, arguably, the most over due.<br />For those of you who haven't scene this movie&#8230; it is a tale about a baby that is destined to bring about the end of the evil rule of Queen Bavmorda and those who will fight to protect that baby.  There are glorious battles between the minions of evil and the knights of good, there is a touch of romance, and there is magic. The scenery is stunning, the acting is pretty good and the story line has something for everyone.  Children will love the film for the playful nature of many of the characters.  Parents will love the film for the unlikely romance and the fun of seeing Val Kilmer in what I believe to be his best performance. This is probably one of the best family movies to come out of the eighties.<br />The DVD version doesn't boast very many extra features, but the color and sharpness of the film definitely make it worth owning.  The sound is pretty good, but nothing compared to some other DVD's out there.  For the most part this DVD is worth buying for the sheer fact of having the movie.
B005HSL626|5|this is a great game! I hate it when people complain about the ads all you have to do is press continue!!!!!!!!
B006IGZWB2|5|Great acting, great directing, great writing. A sad period in American history, but a story told very well with charming humor. This movie deserved the Oscars it received.

B00000G3AZ|3|Emma goes riding.  Emma shoots.  Emma gets stuck in a bog and is rescued.  If Emma had such an exciting life, she would not have needed to try to mold Harriet.

B00BU1DH1M|2|I've been a fan of the Rebus series but this book is boring...
0062082353|2|It took a while for me to write a review to this book because I really wasn't sure how to approach it. I really wish there was a different rating system for this book besides a strait 1 - 5 stars. A further breakdown may go something like this: o stars for Scott McEwen & Jim DeFelice for their writing and inability to mold the many accounts of Kyle's service into something that was not so boring. I've read many military non-fiction books, and this is by far the driest. It doesn't really make you want to like the real people that are depicted in this book. Granted there are some things not to like about some of the subjects and people portrayed, but overall the conveyance of character development was severely lacking.<br /><br />Now onto Kyle himself. I'm sure that he shared some of the blame when it comes to the material that was conveyed, and I can't rip into the guy for getting a payday on a book deal, but if there wasn't a lot to tell, don't tell it in book form. That being said, there has been a lot of criticism of Kyle's one dimensional description of the insurgents and those he fought. I can't believe people don't see how complex his descriptions are at the root of his mentality. He killed more people in a more personal fashion than any other soldier in modern combat that we know of. That being said, most people (soldiers included) have a hard time killing one person. My personal view is this is how Kyle coped with the actions that he has taken. He could either come apart with all the different shades of grey on the battlefield or he can make it a black and white argument in his head in order to live with himself in &#34;civilized society.&#34; This gives you an unintentional personal insight into the struggles that soldiers face when returning home after being in a wartime environment. Those aspects I would rate at 4 stars. Overall, I averaged it out to 2 stars (IMHO), but it could have been a lot better if the book hadn't seemed rushed to the printing press to sell a mediocre offering.<br /><br />I do thank those portrayed in his book for the sacrifices they made to keep this country safe by redirecting the focus of the extremists off civilians and onto them; the warriors of the battlefield. May he and his buddies rest in peace.to sell a mediocre offering.<br /><br />I do thank those portrayed in his book for the sacrifices they made to keep this country safe by redirecting the focus of the extremists off civilians and onto them; the warriors of the battlefield.

It &quot;Shocked Me&quot;, when I found most of the VERY BEST stuff did not make this album. Such as ladies Room&quot;, &quot;Take Me&quot;, &quot;X-Ray Eyes&quot;, &quot;2000 Man&quot; are only to name a few VERY BEST of songs from Kiss that are not on this album. I would obtain the &quot;Double Platinum&quot; album which is a TRUE &quot;Best Of&quot; Kiss and skip this album. And use &quot;DP&quot; to introduce the new generation to the group.

0439023513|4|Warning: This review does contain spoilers.    First off, I have been anticipating this book since I finished Book 2. The minute I got it, I sat down and read it straight through. At the end of the day, though, I have mixed feelings about the book.    First, the good points of the book: Many characters who were just supporting characters before were developed and took on larger roles in the books, notably Finnick and Annie. We also finally get to find out about District 13 and what has been going on there. Ms. Collins really has a gift for making me get attached to her characters--when they die, it's heartbreaking. Katniss's pain is real and believable, and, I feel, justified. I really loved this book for the characters, and the story itself, although I'm not exactly sure how to put it into words.    At the same time, however, there were parts of the novel that I didn't like at all. I felt like Katniss spent too much of the book in the hospital. She starts off in the hospital. She gets to go to battle, meets with the rebels...and ends up in the hospital. She goes to District 2, to help with the fighting...and gets shot. And after they take over the Capital, Katniss once again is in the hospital. Now, the fact that soldiers get wounded and end up in the hospital is understandable, and makes the book more realistic, but so much of the novel is spent with Katniss in pain, Katniss wounded, Katniss on pain killers. Then there's Peeta, who was taken prisoner in the last book. I understand Ms. Collins' reasons for making Peeta hate and not know Katniss, but I miss the influence his character had on her. In the other books, he helped her on stage, and fought with her, and supported her. In this book, he is in the Capital, or locked in the hospital, and Katniss goes around with Gale, who I feel doesn't support her as well. I suppose this had to happen in order for Katniss to realize who she loves, but I wish Peeta had more screen time. Finally, I felt like the ending of thebook wasn't as strong as it could have been. Katniss goes back to District 12, without her mother, Prim is dead (which I really didn't like--the whole basis of the series is Katniss sacrificing herself for Prim), and many other characters have places in the government, but Katniss doesn't take a role in the new country at all.    One last thing that irritated me a little was the lack of any Hunger Games in this book. In books 1 and 2, Katniss is fighting for her life in the arena, but not in this one. In this one, we have two mentions of it--that the city is boobytrapped like the Games, and President Coin's idea to force the people of Capital to host one.    I enjoyed reading the book very much, regardless of it's flaws, which were only minor, and were just the way Ms. Collins chose to tell the story. It was a wonderful book overall, but a four star wonderful book, not a five star one. That said, I do recommend it, and the whole series, to anyone who enjoys a well-told story.
B006LSZECO|4|Heard great things about the book, have wanted to read it for a while. It was easy to download to my tablet. Great story so far, I haven't gotten to the end yet!
B00000GAIW|3|Aqualung - Jethro Tull (3.21 stars)<br />Original Release: 3/19/1971<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Aqualung (4 stars)<br />Anthemic guitar line accompanies a lyrical description of a filthy pedophile-beggar who dies in the cold.  But the majority of the song's midsection features an acoustic guitar which softens the tone towards a character that the lyrics now invoke sympathy for.  Also there is an upbeat section with piano and acoustic guitar that then turns into a reflective, soulful guitar solo that in turn becomes a rock solo after the first four measures.  Great character sketch of one who has fallen to the absolute bottom.<br /><br />Cross-Eyed Mary (3 stars)<br />Lyrics seem to describe a Lolita-prostitute that has relative success over her poor piers.  Flute and mellotron start the song quiet and like the coming of some monster theme the intro builds.  Organ and guitar put a hard rock edge on the lyrical description of the song's protagonist.  This song is a good compliment to Aqualung (there is even a lyrical tie-in).  There is only a brief flute and guitar solo, but overall this is a good, funky hard rock song<br /><br />Cheap Day Return (3 stars)<br />Acoustic guitar passes briefly through a few melodies creating a sense of anticipation.  The song is short and the lyrics capture a moment, a day, that the vocalist looks back with derision to.<br /><br />Mother Goose (4 stars)<br />Lyrical encounter with various circus-fantasy figures strolling through the city.  Acoustic guitar and flute play a happy melody which draws out a sense of insanity from the lyrical events.  This song stands out for me mainly in its lighter series of engaging melodies.<br /><br />Wond'ring Aloud (3 stars)<br />Vocalist seems to be recalling images of his wife/lover who makes food and love for/to him.  Also there is a sense of drawing from these experiences deeper principles of life.  Acoustic guitar then piano then strings instrumentally decorate this short ballad.<br /><br />Up to Me (3 stars)<br />Lyrically this song looks at the world as an extension of one's self and avoiding giving up personal responsibility.  Flute and vocal laughter promise antics while the acoustic guitar plays the anthemic line.  The trickster-like sense of this song is appropriate to the theme of self-awareness.<br /><br />My God (3 stars)<br />The lyrics speak of what the church has done to God, commoditized Him amongst other things.  Acoustic guitar starts off warily.  This song has variety of melody and an instrumental section that fills out the song's length with progressive qualities.  With the guitar we finally get a good aggressive flute solo (which has been lacking somewhat from previous albums).<br /><br />Hymn 43 (3 stars)<br />The lyricists pleads to Jesus, but is sorry for how He has been abused.  This song is a piano rocker right off the bat with a guitar anthem.  There is definitely something of the holy roller passion in the vocals as well.<br /><br />Slipstream (3 stars)<br />Short song that seems to be a warning to the materialists in the pews.  Sweet vocals, strings and acoustic guitar counter the sarcasm of the lyrics.  The strings end in a vaguely chaotic dissipation created by some studio effects.<br /><br />Locomotive Breath (3 stars)<br />Return to a character sketch of desperation; this time about a man for whom everything is going wrong/spinning out of his control.  A peaceful piano intro. with Chopin-esque qualities gives way to a soulful guitar and piano movement, then a 4/4 rock rhythm, still calm but sassy.  Further instrumentalism includes a guitar and piano anthem.  A throbbing bass pushes this rock 'n' roll train along.<br /><br />Wind Up (3 stars)<br />Bitter resentment directed at the church in the form of a flat denial of their grasp on the truth.  A quiet guitar and vocals accompanies this lyrical message.  This melody repeats and builds instrumentally and in volume until the final guitar anthem kicks in.  The ballad then turns into hard rock.  This process repeats from quiet to loud to quiet, perhaps, suggesting a winding up and down movement.<br /><br />Album:<br />This fourth Jethro Tull album is yet another collection of songs but with a more coherent sound across the whole album.  The character sketches and the God-church songs represent a couple of themes on this debatable two-concept album.  Certainly the guitar has found a clearer more confident voice.  There is also a flirtation with the progressive rock form in a couple of the longer songs.  Jethro Tull continues to rotate through different sounds turning by degrees from blues to hard rock.  Some of the songs I recognize from the radio I may have already heard too many times and so their character may not impress me as much as it should (particularly \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath\\").<br /><br />A couple of songs on this album strike me as progressive rock songs: Aqualung and My God.  Other songs indicate their penchant for complex composition but they have not yet broken through into this, at the time, still emerging genre.  Overall I not yet as engaged with Jethro Tull's sound on this album (rather I prefer particular songs) as I am on many of their later albums.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Four star songs (4 stars)<br />1.

B004ADH1RI|5|Classic movie.
B00J4KZSHW|5|Gave to my wife's Mother. She loves it.
B000OQF6N6|5|I am so happy that these guys are back. I have been a huge fan of them for years! The standout tracks: Doomsday Clock, That's The Way (My Love Is), United States, Tarantua, and the bonus track from Target (the title track)    All the songs are listenable. Very good purchase. You will not regret it!
0385537131|3|Not one of Grisham's best. It took too long to get anywhere and was predictable. The ending was a let down.
B000AM6OQ2|5|When this movie was released in theaters in 1979/1980, it was considered to be \\"John Carpenter's worst mistake\\", but today, it is considered as a total horror classic !<br /><br />I don't know what people where thinking back in the 80's when they said this movie was terrible, I mean, from the first moment I saw it, I totally liked it and it scared the hell out of me !<br /><br />I was something about 7 or 8 years old when I first saw it, it scared me a lot, but let me tell you right now I'm 19, almost 20, and it still scares me so much, you never get bored of watching it, specially if it is in a cold, rainy weather at night, besides, the atmosphere of this movie is so great, it has that carpenter's style of horror from Halloween, Halloween 2, and possibly Halloween 3.<br />Go ahead and watch \\"The fog\\" ! !<br /><br />Greetings!
B000088E6D|5|AWESOME! Cd. It was well packaged and brand spanking new and the price can't be beat!. Will buy again....Thank you!
1455502626|3|The dialogue in this one...the first person self talk of John Corey, is fantastic. Laugh out loud funny at times...literally. Maybe that's because I'm a smart ass myself.  I mean, DeMille is talented enough to write 5 star stuff - and Corey's self talk is really really fantastic... but I thought the relationship development between Corey and his major love interest - and his major hate interest - were not developed believably- and the final chapters about the boating in the hurricane were obviously written by someone who doesn't understand boating. That turned a 4-5 into a 3-4. Wish I could go 3.5 stars.....worth the time, and it was good enough for me to read some more in the Corey series...but almost really great.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Even though this book was young adult, it was very adult. Saw the movie also and it was very much like the book.  It was wonderfully written with great emotion!
B00CWY76CC|4|Love this game, it really keeps you on your toes.  The fact you can get help if you get stuck so u can keep the game moving.
B000CNESU8|5|This was purchased as a gift and she loved it.  One of her favorite movies of all time.  Thanks for selling.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I hated the first one cause it was hard and scary and usually I don't play horror games but this one I cant beleave it I peed my pants playing this game its fun I hate balloon boy he's so annoying foxy made me piss my pants my parents slapped the s*** out of me I was soo confused like your gonna slap me cause I got scared s***less? so I loved it but I hate it for good reasons
0374533555|5|I'm so pleased to have begun reading Daniel Kahneman's, Thinking, Fast and Slow because right from the start his writing is accessible to me as a layman. While I haven't finished the book yet, I feel I've read enough to anticipate a five star experience with the remainder. I love how he has created system one and system two to help me identify with ways that my own rationalizations fit into each system. As I've grown older I'm more and more interested in the kinds of insights this book offers about why I think the way I do. I also especially like how, despite being a Nobel Prize winner, the author is humble in giving credit to his late research partner and humble in tone as he relates his research to the reader. This is just delightful.
B006FPFTMS|5|Has a lot of nice functions available that work well for study and notation. Highlight in lots of colors, Underline, strikethrough and more, all in your choice of color. Also has handwriting capabilities.
B00H9KKKAY|5|I never stopped laughing. This movie brought back so many memories. It was great..Leonardo DiCaprio was great! Another winner for Scorsese!
B006YC74E8|4|It's free. You can crop/adjust color easily. The only criticism is probably more with the kindle itself...but it is very hard to see the shutter button and line up the camera to take pictures of things (other than your face).
B00F1BFNFA|5|Another great season of Downton Abbey.  I really appreciated being able to see the episodes uncut.  Having new characters helped the story lines move ahead.  I hope next season will FINALLY bring lasting happiness to Lady Edith, she deserves it.
B00CWY76CC|4|I wish it gave you a few hints sometimes other than that its a ok game .if you like puzzels you like it
0385335482|3|This was a book I was not planning to read, but heard so many raves for it that curiosity got the best of me. <br />This is a fun, funny book about the trials and tribulations of a full fledged compulsive obsessive shopper! Becky Bloomwood, ironically a financial journalist for a money management magazine, cannot control her urge to shop! She NEEDS everything and her mind doesn't rest until she gets it.<br />Becky is a bit flighty, but she is also humorous, and has such an addictive way of looking at things and at rationalizing her spending. Her relationship with her friends, family, and would be male relationships are less than satisfying. She continues to take, take, take from her roommate without ever offering anything in return. And she wracks up insurmountable debt from cover to nearly cover, until she begins to turn the situation around. She finally gets passionate about something other than shopping, and that is what makes all the difference. She also wins the heart of her &quot;crush&quot; and that is where we are left.<br />This book is not deep, or even thick with a plot. It is just a lot of fun when you are in need of mindless, effortless entertainment. I am definitely going to read the sequel, but read these books in tandem with another book. That way, depending on my mood I have Becky Bloomwood's rollercoaster shopping/spending sprees to look forward to when I need a good laugh anf guaranteed fun.
B00192KCQ0|5|Only one thing to say....THEY ARE BACK!!!!! I just got Death Magnetic and it is absolutely awesome. Anyone that doesn't like this piece of Metal Mastery is out of their bleemin' mind. This is what Metallica fans have been waiting for all these years. The Hamster is back with unbelievable solos. No complaints what so ever. A big #%&* yeah and hank you to Metallica for bringin' the goods. Album of the year thus far. This is definitely the shot in the arm that the music industry in general needed. Thanks.
B002PEP4SC|5|Great book!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Typically great Grisham  !!!
B0074D3CAQ|4|A great journey that proves its never too late to reflect on the past and pave a new road for the future.  Harold Fry is an ordinary man that influences many on his own personal journey, once again demonstrating that we can all leave our mark on the world in our own unique way.  The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a simple story, yet will leave you totally fulfilled and inspired to pave your own journey in life.
B00FATEJYE|5|This is the best app I've ever had I like that they added challenges to the game I could recommend one thing though I wish they had online multiplayer
B000N3ST8O|5|As a diehard Stevie fan for over 20 years, even I was a little skeptical about another \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation.  After all, I own \\"Timespace\\" and \\"Enchanted.\\"  Nevertheless, I made the purchase, more interested in the accompanying DVD than the CD.    Was I in for a surprise . . .while I do agree with other reviewers that the CD is missing some key Stevie songs, some of the remixes on here are just incredible.  I especially enjoyed the \\"club remix\\" of \\"Dreams.\\"    The real gem in this purchase, however, is the DVD.  Seeing these old videos again was amazing.  What I got the most enjoyment out of was listening to the commentary Stevie provided about each video.   You feel like she is watching the videos with you, filling in the blanks behind the storyline of the videos, remembering details even she has forgotten as she watches these long-lost treasures.  Additionally, in each video, she comments on her wardrobe and especially her hair, which is hysterical!    A must-have for any Stevie fan.  You will listen and watch over and over again.
B0000AKCLS|5|This is my first album by Joe Bonamassa and I'm surely enjoying it!  Years back I used to listened  to the \\"Old Blues Men\\" but then became interested in other genres which filled up my listening time.  Coming upon this album by accident - a recommendation by Amazon - I'm glad to see that young talent is taking up the cause. JB has much talent and reading his bio I'm doubly impressed.<br /><br />  This album covers some standards as well as originals and shows off his excellent guitar work. The other members of his group are of the same caliber as he is.  His voice has just the right amount of \\"untrainedness\\" to it to make the listener feel like he really does \\"have the blues\\".  Not just mouthing it.  He seems to have borrowed from the old and put his own spin on it.<br /><br />  I would recommend this album highly to anyone who is a beginning rocking blues lover, an old hand, or someone finding the blues again.  I've listened to it a number of times and have only had it a few days.  Great!  I will be buying more from his repertoire soon.
B001K3KK0Q|5|This is a classic.  If you read the book , you know this is it.  They are all amazing.  I love this movie.
B000N3ST3Y|5|Those that are curious about Genesis will not be dissapointed by this.  Eighteen tracks is enough to introduce you to this wonderful British band.  Most of these tracks are from the Phil Collins era, and two are from the Peter Gabriel era.  Hits from the Phil Collins era include \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Misunderstanding\\", \\"Throwing It All Away\\", \\"Land of Confusion\\", \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"That's All\\", and many more incredible hits!  The tracks from the Peter Gabriel era are \\"I know what I like (in Your Wardrobe)\\", and a re-recording of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\", entitled \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\" in which both Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel reunite with Genesis.  Both these tracks are wonderful songs that deserve all the credit they can get.  One other track, that's not from either of the Collins or Gabriel era, is \\"Congo\\".  A Scotsman named Ray Wilson took Phil Collins place after Phil anounced that he was leaving Genesis.  \\"Congo\\" is decent, and has a bit more of the rock influencnce than some of the other songs.  Still curious?  Pick this up and have a listen!  This cd is also suitable for casual fans as well.  If you want a better overview of Genesis then pick up the Deluxe Two CD Limited Tour Edition of \\"Turn It On Again: The Hits\\", which covers more ground.  I also recommend The Platinum Collection, which covers their entire career on three cds.
B0011UJMK2|5|This is definitely a page turner!!!
0792833260|5|The quality of this &#34;used&#34; DVD was without flaw.  The story, best Oscar film in 1988 or 1989 is very touching.
0385340567|2|I'm really surprised at this Lee Childs book.  I always wait with anticipation for the release date of Jack Reacher's story, and this time was no different.  But, rather than sitting down for one long reading to finish the book, it took me three weeks to get through this one.  I had no problem laying it down, and starting other books while this laid unfinished. I eventually finished reading it, but it was an effort.
B006OCM0G0|5|this app is fun playful and looks like yummy food so u will feel hungery wen u play this JUst Warning u so this is a cool game don't lissen to thoughss other people<br />have a nice day and this is a good menu for food so look at this menu<br />love. u<br />bye
B00IS87HYI|1|stupid
B00BI73CVI|3|I was looking forward to the movie but did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  Some of the singing parts were not good, but that is because they cast actors in the movie instead of singers.  They had some good sets and costumes but I wish some of the actors were changed.
B00JRCB3HQ|5|Nice piece. Wish I could open the doors though.
B00FAPF5U0|3|I was satisfied
B006LSZECO|5|I read this book in 4 days which is pretty fast for me. I had a hard time putting this one down! If you are someone who enjoys a book full of suspense and keeps you guessing this is a must read for you!
0439023513|5|I haven't gotten a chance to read it yet, but it was a gift for my girlfriend. Amazons gift-wrapping is amazing. She said she really enjoyed the book.
B00C7KXUOE|5|I expected Hannibal to be a poor imitation of some of the movies including silence of the lambs but it is an exceptional presentation of the first stories with Will Graham.  I didn't read the books, but the plot and acting of the TV show is so refined that I am awestruck in the details and nuances.  The cinematography and music is equally impressive. .
B00G7QPXUI|4|Not a happy feel good movie, but the acting by Cate Blanchett was superb. I am so glad she was given the academy award, it's an outstanding performance.
B002SF9Y8E|5|I am sure it isn't to everybody's tastes but it makes a refreshing change to most of the musac style rubbish you hear all Christmas season.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Amazing book loved the end it was very happy yet sad at the same time hope you like this book as much as I have.
B007J4T2G8|5|Loved this book after hesitating for months to read it.  I was amazed at how I got so attached to and fell in love with the characters.  This is not the type of book I would normally read, but I have to say I was not disappointed.  I can't wait to finish the series and see what happens.  I am also pretty sure that I'll be sad when its over.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5|If you are a fan of music and the creative process in general, you will enjoy this look into the inner workings of a studio that birthed countless classic albums as well as a glimpse into just how much mojo a single piece of equipment can wield.
B003XF1XOQ|5|After reading the second one, you are willing to read this one, and you will not regreat, easy to read, keeps you in the mood of reading more, It es better than the second one. And finish is excellent.
B003WJQ74E|5|This is one of the best short reads I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It captivated and drew me into its world in the very first chapter. Unlike other books it made me feel every emotion as if I knew Charlie Gordon or watched him tell his story. I recommend this book to any adult who thinks live couldn't be any harder and to anyone looking for something to be thankful for. I learned to appreciate the beauty of knowledge just a little bit more than before I read this.
B008ROZAQU|5|Great movie.  Once of Wayne's best.  A must see.  Howard Hawks has a great grasp of background and uses the Tanganyika well in the movie.
B006LSZECO|5|I have never read a book like this in my life. It is such a crazy crazy plot and twist, of course it had to become a movie. Now that I have finished the book hubby and I can watch the movie!!! I am so curious now about her other books because Im so impressed, Im speechless.
B0041OT9W6|5|loved the book.  I have visited their house in Amsterdam, so it was much more interesting to me.

B0042RJWTC|2|Was Henry VIII so quiet and unassuming, was his life so staid and predictable that U.S. audiences would never sit through a series based on his exploits? The people who brought us 'The Tudors' certainly thought so.  The Irish/Canadian production team took one look at Henry, his court, his wives, his wars and his battles with the Church--and his impact on world history, culture, art, literature, politics, religion, geography and music and said, \\"How the heck can we make this guy's life sound interesting?\\"<br /><br />'The Tudors' plays so fast and loose with history that even someone with my minimal knowledge had to constantly point at the screen and hoot.  But hey, it's TV, so let's not nitpick. The episodes are colorful and entertaining and we are, after all, just Americans.  Why give us content when all we want is 'shiny.'<br /><br />The series goes off the rails from the gitgo. Here's what one might learn from Season One:  The Boleyn family was apparently unaware of the existence of printed books (which had been introduced about one hundred years earlier). It took Cromwell to explain the concept of a printing press to a mystified George B.  Princess Mary, Henry's sister is combined with Lady Mary, his eldest daughter. The producers no doubt decided anyone with the monicker \\"Bloody Mary\\" was the money Mary. With Henry's penchant for marrying Catherines/Katherines, Annes and Janes, they must have assumed that we'd never handle a pair of Marys and decided to spare us the additional confusion. You have to respect that kind of consideration for viewers.<br /><br />The series shows Wolsey committing suicide in prison after being tried and found guilty of treason. Big deal. So the man died of natural causes before the trial, but, hey nonny nonny, it's close enough for madrigals.  And at least they don't have the poor Cardinal  doing an Isadora Duncan dance routine in his his cell -- which is how little Cathy Howard spends her last, precious moments.<br /><br />The people and the props seem to be plucked from a generic \\"Costume Drama: Days of Old When Knights Were Bold Period\\" warehouse.  The anachronisms are egregious and occur in scene after scene, episode after episode.  People travel in carriages, Henry fires a flintlock musket and admires the Venus de Milo. Most of the historical OUCH moments are pretty obvious, and I'll bet a truly knowledgeable person's head would explode from recognizing the details I missed.<br /><br />Okay, the BBC would never perpetrate this kind of fraud upon its public, but 'The Tudors' was made for Americans, and let's face it, we have never let facts mess up our own history.  Our own beloved President Reagan said 'facts are foolish things.\\"  We believe them impedimentary and unnecessary if they interfere with a good story--just take a look at the 5 Star reviews for this series.  Many completely dismiss the need to present history without distortion.  Accuracy is something that interferes with the plot and adds nothing.  One even believes that until this TV show came along, poor Henry was known \\"throughout history\\" only as a crude barbarian who tossed chicken bones over his shoulder.  The mini-series finally pulled the curtain of obscurity aside and it is her hope that, because of The Tudors, history will no longer ignore Henry. Moreover, she believes it will alert future generations to the fact that he was a hottie. Maybe the producers of this series weren't so far off the mark when assessing their audience.<br /><br />If you want a mishmash of soap opera plots, lavish (if historically muddled) costumes, and overacting, if you like to pretend you are watching something culturally enlightening and educational when merely viewing a telenovela in drag, this series is made to order.  And to set the record straight, I have at least two toes in this camp, if not the whole foot, so I had to give it that second star.  Watch it for the bright colors, the passionate embraces, the whole romance novel nonsense. Just don't pretend it's anything but a Goo Goo Cluster.<br /><br />(I understand Michael Hirst, who created 'The Tudors,' is planning a series on Vlad the Impaler--if he can figure out a way to add some sex and violence to the story of that kindly and courtly old statesman.)nderstand Michael Hirst, who created 'The Tudors,' is planning a series on Vlad the Impaler--if he can figure out a way to add some sex and violence to the story of that kindly and courtly old statesman.)

0780625129|4|This movie was brilliant.  I couldn't stop watching this movie.  The reason that I gave it only a four was because there was so much swearing and some UNBELIEVABLE cruel violence.  Like the curb scene which you guys don't really need to know until you see the movie.  But there is one part in the movie that I found was worst was when Derek was in prison but we don't need to tell you about that either.
