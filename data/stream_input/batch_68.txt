B000COAYE6|2|I'm sure that these are probably fine if they fit.  Bought it for a '68 Camaro. The Camaro has the Z28 steering box, and the headers wouldn't fit.  Had to buy the longer hooker headers for the '68 Camaro.
B00X7JY8HM|5|Great sunshade. Perfect fit. Really hot here in Dallas and this shade saved my interior. Folds up to a compact, easily storable size.
B005N6XC7O|5|I want more to choice from,,,,,
B00029KA6I|5|Great
B00026Z3E0|5|These are well built and pair nicely with the 3-ton All-in-one bottle jack.
B008EEYTRE|5|Worked great on my 2008 Odyssey van. Fit just like the original parts. All the parts are name brand suppliers that make the stuff for Honda to begin with so you get OEM quality and performance for a fraction of the price. Only thing that caught me off guard was that the Mitsubushi belt being made in Thailand as opposed to every other Mitsubushi belt I have used that are made in Japan. From my research it is just as good as the Japanese made one. Its not about where its made, but how its made and quality controlled. Been running for a few thousand miles now with no issue. Engine runs nice, smooth, and quiet. If you are doing the project yourself, make sure to pick up a Honda crankpully holding tool (http://amzn.com/B0000TMLWQ). Used that before on a few different Honda timing belt jobs, and it always takes at least a 10 foot extension pole on my breaker bar to get the sucker loose!
B0084UJB58|4|Not perfectly is lining with my Camry, but good enough for me.
B00E7WEFQ2|5|Okay, I love these eyelashes! I get so many compliments on my little smart car!  I have also had several people as me where I got them because they liked the way they look. Now I just need some big red lips to attach to my grille and she will be complete! I have heads turning and people smiling everywhere I go.
B0075J2R3C|4|Yeah
B00LG07MZE|4|Fits my 2014 Mazda3 sedan with only a small gap above the rear view mirror. Flexible frame makes it easy to get excellent coverage on all sides without only the very minor gap by the mirror.<br /><br />It's minorly embarrassing but I haven't figured out how to fold it back up yet.
B000NCUWNA|5|Works great!!!
B00KTIDLGI|5|Items were recieved on time and as advertised
B000IYABFM|5|Excellent
B00ECGWRHC|5|Great fit and function. Been 3 months now and still works and looks great on my Road King.
B00V6QO5IK|5|Love this Magnet! Great quality and looks just like the photo!
B00MQ5Z5F2|1|the FAKE 1/2 Star --- the REAL XP-10  5 STARS PLUS   This product, purchased from Shun Tech, UNFORTUNATELY, is a FAKE. It does look good and works initially as it should and costs less than the real thing.  However, after 2 uses, it already has shown a decrease in performance. The copiers know to fake and it can easily fool anyone without the benefit of a comparison.  It is being returned to Amazon for a full refund.  I have been in touch with the the genuine manufacturer, Antigravity Batteries, and they explained the subtle differences on the outside of the battery and packaging.  The real problem is what is hidden inside from this knockoff that can one day fail and damage your vehicle or laptop.  They use cheap and of unknown quality components that if they fail at the wrong time, can cause a problem that will leave the user with little recourse.  The most obvious difference between the real battery and the copy is the outside finish. The copy is glossy, looks good, but is slippery and just the first of compromises that lurk in this knockoff.  The real XP 10 is covered with a rubberized finish that before you buy from anyone except Antigravity Batteries, you should make sure that this is what you are getting.   Do not want to suggest that Amazon, Shun Tech, or any of the other sellers knew that this was a phony. But they should know now and remove these fakes from the marketplace.  Will buy this directly from Antigravity Batteries, and I urge you to contact them and see what they can do for you from a price standpoint. This way, you will get the real quality you are paying for with no surprises down the road.  [...]Update: March 2017 After using for over a year to jump start my car's now weak battery and to power my laptop while on the go, can attest it is reliable and gives OUTSTANDING results.
B0056VAC42|5|Will work fine, just read the directions about the scrader valve
B00HR883RK|5|Great product i will purchase another in the future.
B00YB97OCS|5|My seat turned out great. Kept it pulled tight while stapling and trimmed to fit. Vinyl is a little thinner than the original. It was still by far the cheapest like new seat.
B005NLQAHS|5|Easy to use, good quality product.  The pairing was extremely easy.  I use it with TouchScan (OBD Diagnostics), which I got for free in the Amazon Appstore for a couple of golden coins.
B00NFA82RA|5|Quick and easy install. Gave my car a totally new look and lights up the road. Does not blind incoming drivers. Overall good quality easy install and have good perfectly ever since i installed them. I love them and will order a set from my other vehicles.
B00XRLORBW|5|good aftermarket rebuild kit just like the stock jets on a customers bruin 250. and it was here in to days
B00IIWJLO8|5|The originals aged and dried out these fit as the originals
B005KOZ25Y|1|Used this once and it stopped working. Fortunately it did not mess up my car PCM.. Plus, to and insult to injury they won't allow a return. Again I am glad I didn't buy a more expensive model.
B00CS407GS|5|Nice little add on. Took a while to arrive but that's okay. Quality is decent for such small pieces. Would buy again if I ever need replacements!
B007AOSAM4|5|Perfect for the Focus ST!  Trimmable for the factory sub and full size spare!  I also bought the weather techs which don't factor in a full size spare.  These cover more carpet ( the bump out towards the rear). I highly recommend the floor mats as well.
B000AP57OO|5|Great filter, I am using K&N filters on all my cars
B004QXRA00|5|good
B00736HOQW|5|roll tide
B00P2VUG24|5|Look great, work great, ez to install.
B00QAMKNYK|5|It is what it is, a tool kit.
B00DSGI9JC|5|This is a sweet set up, thing is great for keeping stuff dry and secure. Small but plenty of room for recovery, lights...ect..
B00H08AKYQ|5|Very comfortable driving with this visor<br />Day or Night it doesn't matter!
B0058J4L6M|5|They look great and were worth the price.  There's a tab on the bottom of them used to help position them when you put them in.  One of the units wouldn't fit right as the tab was too thick.  A quick bit of filing fixed it.  Other then that, installation was easy once I had the stock units removed.
B00KMPOSLU|5|As expected.
B00GRHSU5C|3|I bought this for my 2015 Wrangler Hard Rock and it fit perfectly fine.  The packaging is real confusing as it looks like you only ordered the front half, but indeed, the shade was for the whole 4 door version.  Its easy to put on and takes about 5-10minutes the first time once you figure out what you're doing.  This does get rid of some head room though - I am 6'5 and though I have enough room with the soft top, this is just low enough that my head hits the top and therefore I can't really use this comfortably.  It looks to be well made as other Rugged Ride products are but ultimately won't work for me and my family.
B001TJ3HUG|5|This product helps keep my wife's and my car's interior clean and smelling new.  Best Leather conditioner and cleaner I have used.
B007G2IN04|2|This bracket leaves serious score marks on your railing but says it does not nd screw knobs at the bottom miss actually screwing in my stove by an eighth of an inch which makes them not go all the way in.<br />If you buy this bracket be sure to put a thin layer of rubber or plastic between the bracket and your railing to protect it
B011CZIJ3G|2|Product is size and looks like someone could use it. But if you look at all their pictures, four of them, you could assume you get all the letters.  Wrong you get ONE of what you pick. It says size but really means what letter do you want for your money. Size has nothing to do with it.  So at this cost if you wanted to spell out your name like Mike it will cost you a small fortune. So save your money or order each letter separate.
B000EDSTAG|4|I bought this to replace one of the same make/model i purchased from West Marine in 1998.<br /><br />That one had been abused, left outside on the back of the boat by mistake on numerous occasions (even in rain storms) faded due to sun exposure, and once i forced the sparker end into my old Magma grill too hard and it came loose in the plastic housing (about 15 years ago). And the thing still worked as it should. I only replaced it as i wanted a newer looking one instead of my poor old abused one :-)<br /><br />The only thing i would say is not great is the light, which is pretty useless. But it safely lights my Magma grills in all weathers, even in the pouring rain which completely wipes out the built in starters. What more could you want.
B00ZX9YFDG|5|I LOVE how classy and gorgeous this is on my car. I have been looking for sometime and frustrated at the basic plates. When I saw these I was skeptical until I placed it on my car. It looks amazing and quality is down to every last detail. I even dropped one of the screw caps while installing on my car. I was afraid to pick it up thinking all the bling fell off, luckily I was wrong and they all stayed in place. I will def be buying more. This product was provided to me in exchange for my honest review.
B000C5YCZ2|5|The product arrived quickly and haven't had a issue yet great.
B00OZ1IXAY|1|The box was ripped and some parts are missing so what I can due
B000CKNNH0|4|Fits my '92 Volvo 960 wagon.
B000C8BNQK|1|This said it was an exact fit for my truck.  It was not.  It fit length, width and height, but neither the oil cooler lines nor the transmission cooler lines would fit the supplied fittings.  I didn't feel like waiting for another product, so I went ahead and put it in thinking I could find adapters or something.  No such luck.  I even went to the junk yard and couldn't find what I needed.  The transmission fitting is for a 3/8&#34; line and my line is a 1/2&#34; line.  The oil cooler fitting was for a 1/2&#34; line but the flange wouldn't fit into the socket because it was too small.  The sockets in the radiator are straight pipe thread and all the GM fittings that I found at the junk yard are all a different thread type.  What should have been maybe a 3 hour job has turned into a 5 day (on and off) nightmare.  I would have been MUCH better off buying the AC Delco part for $200.00 more.
B00NXENJNU|5|It's perfect
B002GJM5B0|5|Great tube
B00280CSF0|2|Packaging sucks!!!...they function as they should. Keeping those haters at bay...woulda liked to see each lug in its own individual compartment though...therefore, dos stars
B004RCQTIY|5|What can I say, it's a fuel filter. Replaced along with airtex pump for my onan 5kw genset. Solved my issues, been working great. These commonly get clogged, so good to keep a spare.
B00HJDI22E|5|bright, nice size, lots of smaller led's make the appearance behind the lens of the turn signal much more even. There are 2 sockets these will physically fit in but the bulb malfunctions if it's in the wrong one.(understandable since your installing it into the wrong socket) The difference is in how the base is wired. These are standard so both grounds are on one end and both powers to the other. The CK sockets are different.
B0057AKQDO|4|as described. Thanks!
B00NAFZRH8|5|Works very well for scraping out any type of liquid from bowls.
B0015D19SS|5|Workes great. Ir did until my wife clipped a tree and we lost the front one. Recovered everything but on of the foam blocks. Just made another one out of spare foam.
B000C34KT2|5|Perfect fit!  Bought this for my husband, he has been trying to find a nose/rattle in his PU for a long time and after much detecting, this belt made the noise go away.  Really good price too.
B0073XIFNQ|3|Easy to install, took me two minutes to unscrew the old one and put the new one on my car. Reception is okay, it depends on certain areas.
B00SXKU586|4|satisfied
B0042Z0E6E|5|Beautiful mat - we use for outside our travel trailer - matches perfectly!
B007LQHIX8|5|This starter is 130 dollars at local power supply co and 119 dollars online. When I received starter from Caltric I compared the old and new starters there was no visible difference, size and weight was the same. The starter worked and fit perfectly. I don't know where the difference is but, I am very pleased with the cost and performance. Would definitely recommend to any one .
B00KY5UGR8|1|***UPDATE PENDING***<br /><br />I can give credit to Trueline Automotive for sending it out quickly and it arriving as such. Outside of that, this product was obnoxious to work with and I never got it applied to my Maxima. I could have just as easily bought another and received some sort of &#34;credit&#34; (per their response to buying individual pieces) but it would probably be better off to cut it by hand. It's not that it was a horribly bad tint as much as it was a bad cut/crappy liner. As I removed the liner on the rear window, it got caught and caused the tint to fold over and make contact with itself, before I could spray it with a slip solution; so it was ruined. As I removed the liner to cover another window, it jumped the cut line and tore into the tint - making it useless. I've tinted windows before and most of the problems I've had were within the vehicle; the problems I had with this product were on the glass table.<br /><br />I imagine that the issue has more to do with the plotter than the tint. I hate giving one star reviews, but I just can't recommend this stuff.
B000GTW2JW|1|Did not fit the seat right.
B00G35TNPY|5|Thanks
B0049Z6VQO|5|awesome
B00MPQ3CZ2|4|appears to be well made. Well worth the price paid. Was more impressed that something that heavy would ship free, and be delivered as soon as it was. Only gave 4 stars because the paint finish is a little rough in places.
B00MT0NC1S|5|Really fast shipping it came to me in an envelope I guess that made it really fast...it's wha I asked for and looks funny on my wife's car.
B009DJXVT6|3|It didn't work on my F150 that it was suppose to.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Works awesome.  Actually had my battery die a few days after getting this and it jumped it a couple of times with no problems.  Also very handy to charge mobile phone while mobile, multiple times.  Very glad I purchased it.
B0040D2REU|5|Perfect fit. No problem at all. All 50 were there.
B0040D2QVE|1|these are a sad excuse for a replacement clip- they are too weak and do not hold the panel in-- I would like to hear if anyone got these clips to work<br /><br />waste of money and my time more importantly
B00QMWQK2M|5|Loved it.
B00RSOLXFM|3|11/23/15 Update  I have thrown this away. I originally gave it 5 stars, it worked wonderfully. However, it didn't last very long, probably just over 2 months. Then it started to get really hot and eventually started to make a clicking sound (almost like a spark) over and over while it was plugged in. Perhaps others haven't had issues with durability but this one fell apart. It did work really well while it worked though.  - Original Review - This has been awesome! I have started driving part time and I wanted my car to smell clean and more importantly I didn't want the smell of smoke and alcohol to linger. Well I have had lots of lets just say, not so amazing smelling people in my car, not to mention someone that actually threw up in the car, but this has kept the car smelling totally sterile. You don't notice that it's doing anything, but that's the point, the car either smells a little sterile or doesn't smell at all and that's exactly what I wanted.  Only possible downside, it does seems to effect my nose and eyes, they seem a little more dry. But I also have an Ionizer in my house which could be part of the issue.
B001JT12A8|4|works well ,good grice too
B000GAN3GC|5|Good oil at a good price for my zero turn trans!
B001OCTE64|5|Quality of the item is fantastic!  It fits the truck perfectly and was very easy to install.  The instructions were very reader friendly.
B002IAQVW6|5|It's wire. It's great. I
B00KJ8L7B4|5|Best HID Kit I have bought. And I have to say the Seller is very professional and courteous!! He answered my questions very quick and when I had a problem he addressed them perfectly. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and I will definitely be buying more in the future. Thanks Innovated
B00LTU1QYO|5|Got it for work to get stuff out of garbage disposal works great
B00S7S8AEA|1|junk not work very easy broke when pull out and problem not right flash right side.
B0009V1WSE|5|This will make sure you get the right size that fits the hole in the receiver.  Provides peace of mind if you stop for a meal on the road and come out to find the carrier gone.
B00CJ7HTNI|1|it does not fit to my toyta sienna and waste the money. thk you
B00FBPQK7Q|5|Loved it works great!
B00EF1ES6C|4|Got the flaps. Installation was easy. They look good, fit good. Took about an hour for the whole truck.
B00CHDIZU0|1|The item was not meant for my 95 ranger because it was too big. The adhesive stickers also did not work well because they let the mirror drop and shatter.
B0084DVI7Y|2|Did not fit my 2011 Honda Accord EX-L V6
B0002MAE0M|5|worked as expected
B0013REXO8|2|I sent these back.  They are cheaply made and it shows.  Just some thin stamped steel pressed into a curve.  There are lots of other options that look better and are structurally strong.  These are flimsy and ugly.
B000BZJEWE|5|This sapped on the Bosch 69128 fuel pump which I had also replaced. The Bosch 69128 does not come with this screen so you will need to remember to order this when you order the Bosch 69128 fuel pump. I used this on my 1997 Ford F150 XLT Triton v8
B000A6X5KG|5|Thanks
B008F8Q86E|5|Aaa
B00DBENCZC|4|They could be brighter but they're still really nice and I like them.
B00H858P3Y|5|Good looking lights and very bright at night .
B004VLVW6K|3|Had to modify it to fit. Its thicker and positioned differently than oem. It works and saved me lots of money. I would buy again but only if really cheap like around $40-50.
B00635OXRC|5|Exactly as described. They shipped 2 day US Mail and were received in perfect condition. Thank You!
B001IX6ACA|5|Notice more power and better gas mileage immediately.
B00BJCN08M|5|Nice sturdy construction. The screws that stabilize the bucket are nice and thick which function very well.  The wheels all have ball bearings and I just think this will withstand many years of hard use.
B00BCR7ASK|1|not good quality
B00H2VVL0S|5|This paint goes on like nothing I had ever used before, it is everything it claims to be.
B00BSB0OMY|4|So far so good
B0002RNS96|3|I have no ability to  evaluate this from actually usage, as it doesn't fit my car. I expect it works exactly as advertised, good shrink wraps and tight solders.....
B00EB10SQA|3|They were exactly what we were looking for. Looks great on the van
B004A6NB1U|5|I thought this was a gimmick, but I discovered to my surprise that my car does smell better with this filter. I'm glad I took a chance with it!
B000EQNX8G|5|Looked up on YouTube how to remove and replace.  Easy done and works like new.
B0018C85VK|5|Arrived accordingly on schedule. It took me 5 min to attach the shocks. There was no instruction paper in the package, so I had to search youtube before installing it. Anyway works brand new and very happy with it.
B000A8JNF0|3|Water doesn't bead like I thought it would. Top looks okay.
B00QW2WM8I|5|Cool little magnet! I have it under my license plate on my car and it looks great!
B00CB03USQ|5|Clean sound.... xpipe made it sound even better
B00ZG3T480|1|Don't buy this item you only get 10 good stickers and the rest are little.Disney stickers highly disappointed and want a full refund
B000N8OZQY|1|Did not fit 95 explorer properly.
B004GCNMC6|4|The mirror is very nice and installed easily.  My only complaint would be the glass itself doesn't seem to be as sharp as the original mirror meaning when you look into the mirror objects aren't as clear.
B00GH31ISC|4|One small light was burned out when I recieved the lights. But it is hardly noticeable.  Very bright and the waterproofing seems to be holding up well.
B0030UQO0M|5|The install is a bit much, but they work well and look good. If your even looking at this you already have admitted to having a jeep parts problem, just go ahead and get it you know you want it. but If you don't enjoy the 3 hours its gonna take to put em on just pony up and get it installed
B00A4QVX4W|5|love it
B0008FUH46|5|Awesome product and price
B00EVILC8G|1|Seems like it would be a huge advance, this piece is sturdy and very well put together, but it just does not work on my 1997 Malibu Response with the Taylor windshield.
B0066TMFIY|5|A+
B004IYWJQ2|5|Really good product
B000C1LLCS|5|Combined these with a set of full set centric rotors and a front pair of akebono pads and they're awesome. No noise, no dust, and my braking is way smoother than before. I will definitely be reordered these if I ever need to get more!<br /><br />My car is a 2008 Honda Civic Si 4dr if anyone has questions on the fit.
B00VEMKZQW|5|I liked it fit just right 👍
B00P8AM97Y|5|I have a black foxbody and this tri-bar makes my mustang stand out. It also helps protect the rocker panels from the elements of rust.
B00029JK78|5|I've tried a bunch of plug wires over the years but keep coming back to the MSD 8.5mm. The boots are a high grade of silicon that does not dry out or burn even close to headers. The terminals are double-crimped (one crimp over the insulation to hold it firmly, a second crimp for the conductor). I've not seen double crimps on other brands, they fold the conductor back over the insulation and crimp the whole thing with a single crimp.<br /><br />I also like that the distributor terminal has a very positive &#34;click&#34; when installed. It really holds it firmly, much more so than other brands.
B00P8AMLMC|5|Replaced the standard black ac knobs on my mustang with this baby! Looks real nice. Nice Nice Baby!
B007WFB3T8|1|Product arrived with several scratches and looked used.
B00PJ21ZX0|5|Nice sound for the price.
B00YTXKKDQ|5|just what I needed at good price.
B000B8I61G|1|Piece of junk. I ordered 2 and they both arrived broken.
B00434ZXS8|5|Absolutely does the trick. The bible-thumpers stay away!
B00B4KPD1Q|5|Perfect replacement for my 08 Silverado. At 80K miles not sure if they need replacing but it gives me peace of mind and you can’t beat the Amazon price. They are VERY simple to replace yourself. If in doubt there are videos youtube that help.
B000YOJ49K|5|Great for storing in small places
B00LAV2BVO|1|Total crap.  Installed on a 2004 Ford Escape.  Six cylinder transaxle.  You have to remove the intake to install so you hope there is no issues with the coils.  Not the case.  These worked fine for a day.  Next day, number three goes bad.  Had to pull the intake to remove it.  Since I had to pull the intake, I figured I better replace all three back ones so I pulled them and reinstalled the original coils that were good.  Decided to leave the front three on to see how they did.  Yesterday, number 5 went bad.  Today I will pull those three and replace them also.  I'll be sending these back.
B0002KO3RO|1|junk, cheap pot metal, with little to pressure it bent on the first use.
B00KTHV2OC|5|Busted part of my CRV's fob, and just moved the part from this over to that. This is clearly cheaper plastic, but it got the job done.
B004KJ6KFG|4|I like the design and it is easy to install and remove. If it stops a transgression I will rate it 5 stars !
B00CYLWV6E|5|I like it very much and would recommend it to anyone it wash good and don't lint up.thanks for a good product
B00TEEW5DI|4|It's good, bigger then I'd hope  but the kids help keep the car clean so that's nice.
B00VNJ4W3S|2|It came late, it was broken, and after fixing it i put i on my car and a day later the sun took all the color off of the top half.
B00SDGVWNM|5|Good product.
B001DR9VQS|5|great product minor brake dust
B00GNT5ZWK|5|excellent. good quality. they fit my Chevy Cruze perfectly.
B00FBTQ29I|5|What a difference! My truck rides awesome now...
B010CAEXW8|5|Excellent detail spray.  Smells good too.
B000C9R1WO|4|Anything is better than fram, plus the price is on point.<br /><br />94 Accord.
B003IS3HV0|5|So my nice leather wallet went through the wash and left it dried out and looking sad. So of course Amazon to the rescue. This stuff worked great the wallet is back to its original color and feels like new again. I think I'll do a second coat and let it dry over night again. The liquid is thick and goes a long way, I will probably have this bottle for 10 more years..
B0044M9RLI|5|I got this more promptly than I thought I was going to and I love it! It is really sleek and well made. Looks fabulous on my car with the black rims and mirrors. It was easy to put on too, I'm glad I found this!
B007ZS99NY|5|Happy with my purchase and it's a great deal for the price. I have a 2008 Chevy Cobalt with 40/60 seats.  I won't have custom seat covers made for this old car and I don't need to. These are great!
B000BQYA7W|5|This will safely remove just about any residue on any surface. Used it to take off some left over adhesive when I had the window tinting removed. Used goof off for over an hour with little success. This stuff worked on the first try in seconds.
B00H7QWNZ0|4|Post mail spent too much time to delivery, however product it is very good quality. Thank you!
B000IYR7PE|5|Wasn't exactly easy to shoehorn this into place but the fan has our 2006 Honda CRV running like a dream again.  Replaced this and the condense fan  (TYC 610530) at the same time because the A/C would only run if you were moving forward at a rapid pace.  Arrived quickly and installed nicely.
B007O5GX14|4|the lead supplied with the p3 I received would not work on my 2002 f350 ford so I had to wire it to my ford supplied connecter. no plug and play there.other than that the unit works fine.  Lee Eubanks
B0082OU772|5|very well made
B004UPZVSC|4|works good on a trip
B00Q6CTNC2|5|Came exactly as pictured!
B000S2SUPC|4|Works..its a filter.  The cartridge is a bit flimsy, but its fine once it goes in the case.
B000Q71N8K|4|Works great for being on the road all week. Much better than using ice.
B00NLR065S|5|Good quality I like use them every chance I get. I need to buy armor to insert.
B0055B0XA6|5|100%
B0003041H0|5|This stuff is the best to protect all your engines
B002G1PBW8|4|As advertised works for low pressure shrader valves only.  Caps are for both sides tho.
B00OX1WIT8|3|For the price, this is a decent organizer. It has two straps that hang off the head rest. The back attaches to your seat with Velcro.. so if you have leather you're out of luck. The carrier has 6 pockets. The two large middle pockets are awesome. They are wide and you can actually fit a lot in them. My biggest issue is the 4 smaller pockets (two on each end) really don't hold much. They just barely fit a 20oz bottle of water. Most of the items I like to keep in it are bigger like baby wipes, diapers, Clorox wipes, and hand santizer. They just don't fit. I wish they would have opted for 4 large pockets instead of the small pockets.
B00S724MHU|5|Love it
B00KTIYXLU|5|Worked great and easy to activate.
B00LF07S4A|1|Warning!!! Even it says size 8.5 on the shoes this is definitely not a US 8.5 but a US 10.5.
B00TY0DEKU|1|These are awful! They do not fit. They are cheap, thin pads with cheap elastic to hold them in place. I hate them. Do not buy them.
B00FLSG6SQ|3|The mats are nice but not an exact fit. Close but no cigar
B003K29SOO|1|This was the second time I was bit with the wrong auto part which the Amazon system said would fit my car.  I clearly did not learn my lesson the first time a similar situation happened to me with my other car just 1 year ago in which case amazon sent me rear rotors when I ordered front rotors.<br /><br />The problem was made worse as it was a weekend and I was working alone on my car in a warehouse on the edge of town.  I had already gone knee deep having replaced the rotors and I was preparing to replce the pads when I discovered the discrepancy.  The old pads did not look like the new ones. I had to take a cab to a local O'Reilly auto parts store to get the right pads and of course they were of lower quality than the Stop Tech pads would have been for a much higher price.  Between the cab fare and the difference on price for the pads I had to buy from the auto parts store in a bind, I was out an extra $70.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon customer service and they were very nice in understanding the absolute waste of money and time this cause.  The rep was able to provide a $30 credit to make of for the inconvenience this situation had caused but he made it clear that $30 was the maximum they were allowed to offer in situations like this.<br /><br />I will not buy important auto parts from Amazon anymore.
B001Y8X78E|5|Good instructions to put into service but wished it was shipped in a tube.  Trying to get it from a folded position and then turn it into a rolled unit is taking some time.  Probably over priced for the unit but it did fit the car and I could not find one locally to fit a 2004 Mustang.
B00FTB2IOQ|3|very good
B00HJ6OPAO|5|Just what I needed.
B0040MRX5E|5|Very happy with the quality and fit. Fast shipping.
B0077YWT7O|1|Garbage
B00ELQ415Y|5|Really, really please with how much these deflectors improve the look of our son's car.  My hubby purchased these for this Dodge Truck and my son's Buick to replace the ones he had installed 10 years ago.  We like them because they are not glued to the outside of the vehicle like those we have purchased previously.  My hubby cleaned the vehicles really well prior to installing and you want to make sure you take your time and don't rush the process but otherwise they are fairly easy to install.  The look fantastic and work even better.  The price is reasonable considering what you would pay to have these installed.  We would, and have, recommend these to our friends.  We are waiting for these to be available for my 2016 Kia Sorento and then we are going to install a set for my car too.
B00FHC58OO|5|Very elegant design with a simple, effective message
B0053OSB90|5|Good value.
B00FAV5ZZ4|5|Great fit.
B0051D3MP6|5|Can not beat the price. Help keep my Kawasaki Z RX 1200R fully charge when I am away from home.
B0036VQIKQ|5|Great product! Glad I can still get it. Found it currently not available to me locally. Amazon to the rescue! This stuff works better than Febreeze in automobiles and I prefer to the new Meguiar's odor eliminator scent bomb. Scent bomb reminds me of the old bug bombs &#60;grin&#62;.
B003IFNXGW|5|Really detailed and well made
B00SW3OMZQ|3|It's different
B002DTMWSE|5|I could tell a difference right away..  Turbo is more pronounced and I can tell my truck is a lot more happy now.  Looks great and performs great.
B00AESKT36|4|Looks as advertised, a little plain so can't give it 5 stars but I like it.
B009UOPSOK|1|This kit did not include the map or dome lights as they advertise. Only 6 of the type of bulbs that go in the glove box and door entry.
B00V7Z5264|1|this battery was bought for a 2000 Vulcan classic that mighty max has listed as fitting on there web site .. this battery did not fit it was 1/8 of an inch too tall. with that said mighty max did not only refund my money ,they also refunded any shipping cost and paid for return shipping. according to customer care engineering was unaware of the height issues and is looking in to there &#34;will Fit&#34;  listing. over all I believe that it was quality battery that would last for years, but I was unable to test this theory.
B002LGXNV4|1|this photo shows the bottom attatched, it does not come with this item,  Will not do what it says it does without the bottom shield, and no where to order it.After days of the seller attempting to rectify, they said it must have been a custom made item, and they suggest I have the same part made.  Do not but this,  shop around plenty of better items.  Misleading photograph.
B00D38PFGU|5|Great product
B00SVXS3A2|5|works well
B000CAINDE|5|Definitely noticed the difference between leaving the car outside without the reflector and glad I went to get it for the Summer.
B000IYR2J0|5|Fit my 99 3.4 auto Prerunner perfectly. Holes all lined up. It doesn't have the hangers like the factory radiator but that's no big deal. Easy install.
B002OUMVWY|5|Works better that any o have used before
B000GZAUQ8|5|Great buy
B003TPOXUG|5|Great Product and Vendor
B00NPQKURO|5|This product saves you a lot of money. I was skeptical at first but the product is 100% better than the one offered by Toyota because the reinforcement will help to keep it from breaking again. Scion put too much stress on this handle and so its only a matter of time before it breaks especially since many people will end up breaking it as they place pressure when lifting the lift gate.
B00JRE38EA|5|Great value as I installed them in my Triumph motorcycle's running lights, wife's Chevy Equinox license plate lights and running lights. Seems they work as long lasting bright replacement lights for many vehicle interior and exterior lighting.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|These things are great.  Handy, compact, utile, waterproof.  Used inside and outside of beach shelter--made for nice beach pad.
B005HAT9SM|5|very good!!
B000C57LYG|5|Works fine. I have a Ford F53 chassis on my motorhome. I have one of the lighter motorhomes that come on that chassis. These shocke are a bit softer than the others that are available which is what I needed.
B00976L174|5|Considering my shifter knob is a hunk of aluminum and I live where outside temperatures reach 110 degrees, this thing is a lifesaver! The fit is going to be different for everyone depending on your shifter. It sits rather loose on mine, but has never slid off, just spins freely, has not been a problem though.
B009X44TD8|5|Very happy with purchase
B002INP6QU|1|Should have listened to the other negative reviews.  Very cheap materials and difficult to use.  1st use, the pin at end the crank bent.  Even though it was cheap, you did not get what you pay for.
B007S0ERWC|5|OEM AT A GREAT PRICE
B004N4WYWQ|5|as described. Thanks!
B00NNYLBS0|5|These are great, OEM, good price.
B002ZTGLFC|5|Nice quality.
B006FRQZOW|5|Good fit on 01 Passat
B00E1SQ5L0|5|Brakes were a great deal, just pay attention to what size wheel the brakes work with.
B000BYB5A4|5|awsome plugs
B008CE0W5Y|5|Good delivery, Good price, Good product. Not much more to say. I installed them on my trailer and they went on quickly and work great!
B0008FUF34|5|I bought this to use with just a hitch cover and have not used it to tow anything yet, but this thing is solid!  Looks and works like a charm and had no problem on a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Mopar hitch.  The rubber ends feel good and even after a few car washes and a few months with this thing, there are no signs of wear or rust.
B0041TR892|5|Easy to replace, and the black matched my car perfectly.
B00FKPJJNY|4|While installing my lights one of the tiny, rusty, wires soldered to the LED board broke off.  I was able to resolder it.  I would recommend looping the wire under the adhesive pad on the back first thing so it doesn't break.  The LEDs themselves are as bright as I hoped, but based on the wires breaking off during installation I am concerned about the longevity of these LEDs.
B000B8N3MS|1|did not fit
B00BMJ5O2W|5|Great and only cold air intake for a Grand Cherokee SRT. VERY easy to install!!!!
B000BQPIGY|3|It did streak.
B000CRB4II|5|My 2005 Buick Terraza (the Grey lemon) was starting to exhibit a lot of noise and vibration.  I replaced the upper mounts which helped a lot but not 100%.  Figured that the cradle mount was probably shot and (once I removed it) that was certainly the case.<br /><br />Installation was a bit of a pain but not awful.<br />Jack up front of car and lower onto jack stands (please never relay on your jack to work under your car.<br />Unbolt the top mounts,<br />Remove right (passenger) wheel and plastic shield.<br />Shop manual says to disconnect cat converter, I did not need to do so.<br />Use jack to support engine (block of wood is a good idea between jack and pan)<br />Remove the two 15mm nuts at bottom of mount.<br />Remove three 15mm bolts from side and upper part of mount to undo bracket that mount attaches to<br />(I used a small Milwuakee M12 1/4 impact wrench for most of the bolts.  A great tool.<br />You may have to raise engine further to fanagle out the bracket and mount<br />Remove crumbling old mount from bracket, clean off the oil, put new mount on.<br />Reinstall the bracket to engine.<br />Now, here is where I ran into a bit of trouble.  When I went to lower the engine it was way out of position, way out.  I used a low profile transmission jack under the tranny pan which helped reposition things and then let me lower the mount (using original jack) into position.  I likely could have used a second floor jack in place of the tranny jack.  If I only had the single jack I am not quite sure how I would have maneuvered engine back into position.<br /><br />Reinstall the nuts, bolts, wheel and everything else you removed.  Lower vehicle and you are good to go.  Between this and the new upper mounts, the noise and vibration is like a new car.<br /><br />Please note that I am not a professional mechanic or expert.  This is simply how I did the job.  Follow my instructions at your own risk.
B002R1MT40|1|Rcvd defective product.  Seller refused to correct the problem so now I am driving around with a headlight that leaks water which is potentially a serious safety issue.  My wife refuses to drive at night because she says she cannot see the road very well which is due to the low output of this defective headlight.
B00X9UYPMW|4|They look great and fit perfect only downfall is the bulbs it comes with are to small and hard to use
B005G0ZS9W|5|Great product,  great price &  fast shipping!  Great lights, they took less than 10 mins to install on my Z06. They really do make a big difference especially at car shows. This unique and unexpensive item will really set you apart from other vettes. It shipped very fast and it's one of mh favorite additions to my vette.
B00P9HGAB2|5|Excelent!
B0009VA870|5|snapped right on and hid a bunch of scratches on my daughters first car. no fuss no muss!
B00LLVDAOA|4|Mixed feelings on the switch, switch works and looks beautiful, but as far as wiring...instructions were so so, but the main problem is the prongs...there's 5 prongs in a tiny surface area and the female tips that come with it are bare metal and can easily touch if not careful...I used heat shrink and that saved the day....I would buy this again
B002TRHM58|2|NOT AS BRIGHT AS THEY SAY!  BURNT OUT AFTER 3  MONTHS!
B00L2X2KYI|1|does not fit on a 2006 g35... I am going to make them fit soon and will upload pics.
B000COCTXA|2|I have a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee and my washer nozzles broke at the inlet.  As it's a common problem for my car model, I got this product thinking that the extensions would relieve stress on the nozzle inlet.  It also helped that this is 1/4 the price of my OEM nozzles.  Installation is easy overall and although the plastic is very glossy and they're a bit boxier than OEM, I think only I'll know that I put cheap nozzles in.  But I found 3 issues which caused me to rate this product so low:  1. The short tubes provided are not very stout, so I had to carefully route it to keep the tube from kinking (no fluid comes out when the hose gets kinked).  I was able to get both kink-free, but I have concern that the tubes will kink after driving around. 2. One of the two nozzles didn't produce any pressure, so the fluid came out as a stream rather than a spray, not allowing the fluid to get anywhere near the windshield.  I contacted Dorman, and they suggested washing in warm water and blowing air through it, which to my surprise actually worked!  Still listing it as an issue, but one that can be easily fixed. 3. After getting both working and aimed, I found there's a lot of fluid that drips around the nozzle.  There is plenty of spray on the windshield, but I am very dissatisfied with pools of fluid around the nozzles after a spray.  I didn't see this in any other reviews, so not sure if it's just my car, or if nobody else really cares about this issue.  I gave this a low rating mainly because of issue 3; it really makes this a less than mediocre substitute in my opinion.  The first two issues caused a little grief, but were easily overcome and in my opinion would've been well worth the cost savings.
B00I2XX64E|4|Works good but you have to be careful or you will take the finish off your car. Use sparingly & it will take off a paint transfer scuff
B00W46VD2W|1|Two weeks after we installed them they started going out. One tiny bulb at a time. All over the camper. I'd send them back but my husband threw out the paper work. Very disappointed!
B00KZ3201O|5|Wonderful addition to my Electric Car.  This Charger works really great.  It is everything the Ads say it is.
B00C8YXH9C|4|A lot of people are having problems with their batteries being drained in a couple months.  I've had my original batteries for over a year and they are still working.  As stated in another review, turn off your unit by holding down on the power button for 2 seconds.  This turns off the unit with no battery drain.  DO NOT cycle through the modes to turn off the unit.  The mode after the 2 red lights seems like the unit is off. But is actually an off mode that drains your batteries.  Hope this helps people with the battery drain issue.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Fun
B0009ZEUSE|5|Good
B00S75A5KA|2|The distance and the actual visible light that these produce are amazing, and I take visibility very important as I drive a very large rig and require to see very far ahead of me to stop in time, but these I have already had two sets fail on me, and will not be buying a third set, but will instead go towards the HID conversion kits.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|They are awesome, I put two on my front bumper(brighter than my cousins 30&#34;) and two under my back bumper and tied them into my backup lights and they work great!
B00QFZUVH6|4|It seems good will know more when I put to use hauling Auto back from Oh to Az
B000HAYUW2|5|Great product
B000C9CC14|4|fixed my problem.
B00I9XH1NO|4|Works. Not compatible with my software though(easyobd). Works but I get warning messages constantly saying it's not supported.
B000ALJ4NS|5|I used this to reattach my rear view mirror to the front windshield of my 1991 truck
B001DR7YZS|5|Easy install and worked as expected.
B0040DX7EO|5|I got this mirror for my sister in law Miata. It works pretty good.
B002YKHRUK|5|one of the best things to buy if you work with any air lines, why find a shut off valve when you can just pinch the line
B00SVHPWZC|5|I have a few pairs of old leather shoes that are starting to show their years. I was looking for a good quality leather conditioner when I came across Leather Naturals and was excited at the opportunity to review their product. It not only works very well on furniture but as you can see from my before and after photos it works very well on shoes also. I am very impressed and this conditioner exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend to anyone in the market for leather conditioner.
B00AGKQO7C|5|PERFECT FIT,VERY HAPPY, I WILL CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU !!!!
B004KEIFTK|1|Product was not good quality at all, I would recommend investing is a better quality product here.
B00ZC6AX04|3|Works but my wife hates it.  Says it makes her BMW look trashy. But I think she just likes putting her oversized purse in my lap.
B009SAAK7G|1|terrible job with the threads that mount the lights. Hardware wont stay in even with thread lock.
B00D2HI32U|5|Works great. Bit of a delay from when you push the button to when the winch engages. Otherwise nice.
B000HZWDJY|5|Love them they look awesome
B000CKNM9E|5|Exactly as described. Fit my 01 TJ perfectly. Can't beat the price.
B003532V0Q|5|OEM part at 1/4 the price quoted by my Audi dealer. Prompt delivery. Fit as expected--like a glove. Very Happy!!
B007KBQ1PA|4|UNC part is not that bright blue, damn near grey
B00LXFRROI|4|I was disappointed there were no bushings with it.
B007Q82FRA|4|very satisfy
B00II5YADC|5|I bought one of these years ago at a local store and it was finally falling apart, I looked around at local stores for a replacement and could not find one.  This one has a little different handle design, but it works just like the original one I had.  Thank you Amazon you have everything!!
B00DSSNPSU|4|The product was what I needed.  It was delivered on time, I definitely will shop again soon,  thanks.
B00H91EY9G|4|Perfect replacement for my 08 Silverado. Seeing them made in China didn’t make me happy.
B0002V9IFU|5|Very Nice
B00ERFGYGI|5|I bought this for my fiance', he absolutely loves it! Will definitely be buying more!
B0051D3MP6|1|Product was exactly as advertised. I bought this Charger to maintain the battery for my scooter, Package arrived two days earlier then expected delivery date which is always a plus. Opening the shipping package I noticed the original box for the item was a little mangled which didn't really bother me since I was aware that I bought this item as refurbished/used. After Opening the item I was pleasantly surprised that despite being used all the advertised parts were present and the Items them selves appeared new with Zero damage. I have always had positive expectations for Black & Decker products and have never been disappointed. This charger is of good and sturdy quality. The different connectors fit snug into the ports of the charger. If I could give a higher rating for this Item I would.<br /><br />Update! - After charging the battery and leaving the device to &#34;Maintain charge&#34; for a week I decided to take a short trip to the store on my scooter only to find the battery on my scooter dead and the charger/tender showing that the battery is fully charged? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT&#34;S A COMPLETE PIECE OF GARBAGE! Very Disappointed. so not only does this not maintain the charge on the battery it seem to drain the battery. I know the battery had a full charge when I attached the Tender and watched the device continually show a &#34;Green Light&#34; (not a blinking green light which indicates it's charging nor an amber light which mean a problem). after unplugging the device and plugging in again it showed a &#34;blinking green light&#34;. It Seems like the the device charges but unable to maintain the charge. will update again with results.<br /><br />2nd Update - Item is defective, Returning now - Do Not Buy, It's a waste of your time & Money!
B009S7IACQ|5|I had to replace a skylight on my 2014 5th wheel after a recent hail storm while camping in a state park. I ordered this while still at the park and it was waiting for me when I returned home. I could tell right away that this one was far superior to the original. It's very well made and solid. I found an online video &#34;how to&#34; replace the skylight, which was extremely helpful. I was able to get the new skylight in before the next camping trip and it's leak free.
B00CTB87Z8|4|Good product. I'm satisfied
B00NJRGD70|5|Good product. Like the design of the flaps on the sides if the screen.  Gives many options for different cars .  Looks very sturdy and should last a long time.
B00DZ358AQ|5|Nice battery. worked just fine for my Honda Shadow 2004
B005LDKTV6|3|not so sure about this one?
B000WJYMMQ|3|Will keep honest people honest, but I wouldn't trust it to keep an expensive helmet from being stolen.  Very basic lock.  Have not mounted it yet as I don't have space on handlebars due to windscreen brackets and the the only space on the frame would leave my helmet sitting on the exhaust pipe.  A spring on the lock would be very useful.
B000FW62B4|5|Keeps everything working as epected!!
B000YIW5VA|4|works well
B008SDK89O|4|Woirks fine. Good dfelivery
B007R6JV64|5|Love this product! Perfect paint color match for my 1999 Mercedes E320 W210 brilliant silver.  I have used it to cover my replacement fenders, wrap the bottom of my door, hood, trunk and rear wheel well. this makes fixing rust a DIY project on a budget. and looks great!<br /><br />Pic of fenders: stock fender on the right, wrapped fender on left. can't tell the difference
B00TFSZQ2K|5|A
B0042Z0XWY|5|Just as described. Looks great.
B007Y5EVD6|1|I was hoping for a better quality product. First problem I've noticed with this product is its actually translucent. Second it takes shape memory from being rolled up and in turn likes to curl at the corners and not protect dash corners.
B001PWFPE8|5|Delivered super early! instructions were a little confusing at first but the pictures came in handy. Made a big difference and lowers my 2011 gmc sierra 1500 extended cabs bed just like the new 2014 & 2015's. Definitely would recommend this to friends and family. If you struggle with instructions there are plenty of videos out there.
B00K7X92BI|1|Didn't Fit.
B00JBIBLA0|4|I bought these lights a year ago. The install was a pain, removal of the front bumper cover and etc, but I would have to do that for any headlight replacement. recently, the LEDs on my passenger side have encountered a problem (some died and others are starting to flicker). I like how the lights look and how they fit, and I am going to attempt to repair/replace the LEDs. Has anyone done this? If so recommendations would be much appreciated.
B00KVDOQJ2|1|Was hard to install bulbs and lasted for only months and then the light bezels came loose and lights were aiming straight down and couldn't see the road. I had to replace them.
B001CLB6E0|5|Just as described.
B001SZIFJY|5|Expensive with shipping @ $23.00 USD but did the trick on the Audi!
B00A1O72TW|5|Works great with Android Torque app
B00GHTDGA4|4|good part
B004GCSE9M|5|Great part!
B004I0SOFQ|5|Yup.
B00ABDAHTA|5|It has a nice clear sound when it talks. No echos or background noise.
B004RQX7TO|4|Perfect fit
B00480N0E6|1|Said it would work for a 2008 Toyota prius headlight. Wasn't even a match. Sent it back.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Bought and picked out for grandsons truck.  He loves it and if he loves it so do I.
B005VWRAIC|5|The part was exactly what I needed and cheaper than anywhere else.  It arrived sooner than expected.  I would order from here again.  Not only was it a perfect fit, but it only took me 30 minutes to switch out.  It was nice to have my rear hatch lock again so I could drive my SUV.
B00DV3ZZXA|5|Fit great! Kept the rain out and dried quickly.
B000C5C9SO|5|Had researched many sights and could not find what I needed. Perfect replacement for old worn out ones. Arrived very quickly.
B00BG3GFEU|5|Excellent OEM replacement. Great packaging and timely delivery.
B00PXMANCA|5|Works great with our CRV, fits perfectly.
B00EHIPQ1E|4|Installed in my acura cl. Less than ten minutes. Lights work wonderful. No flickering. Totally worth it. Right on.
B001V8U12M|5|This socket sure speeds up the process raising/lowering the stabilizers
B001F2I7SE|5|Excellent product!!!  Easy install and what a difference!
B00EE1VYRO|5|Ggreat
B000GU3P9W|5|Is perfect! Attaches to backrest with straps, sits on seat when wife's not riding, and fits multiple backrests, our backrest is rather small, but still fit, is great for an overnighter, or a quick trip to the grocery store. Would suggest to anyone looking for a lil extra storage!
B00T36J7ZQ|5|Purchased to use with our 5th Wheel Camper.  They work great for leveling.  Really like how they are self contained with the twist lock.  Had smaller ones with a different camper.  These are same concept in a larger pacakge.
B0016HURK4|1|Fits they keyway but doesnt fit all the way.  Also too long to push for power on or off... does not work.
B000WYYP14|5|This is the third Firestok antenna I have owned.  Great product and tuned easily.  Very satisfied!
B00WF55TKY|1|The dispenser is not included as pictured here.  It's just the hand cleaner refill.  Now I have to find a dispenser.
B004QC8A82|3|requires lubrication as the line gets stuck frequently (every trip). Even with the release unscrewed. Remote feature is awesome!
B00IJF0UQM|4|They work fine, just not very bright
B00480BWCI|5|They work.
B002XA0ZJQ|5|love it.  exactly as described. easily application.  it didn't crinkle up or get any air bubble.
B0056OFWVM|1|Got stuck had to cut it off
B0024EC74M|4|works
B000JK2D06|5|Works great on my white BMW!
B001F0I4QQ|5|Easy installation. Fits perfectly, matches, etc. would buy again
B001UHQXQ2|5|Got this for a really huge discount because of coupons and subscribe and save. It smells nice and lubes up the surface really well. Using this instead of quick detailer saves me money and I can opt to just buy clay instead of a kit or whatever else. The gallon size is the best deal and will last me a long time. One thing I hate about this product is how it leaves my hands blue after a while, but it washes off sooner or later.
B0009I2OKM|5|Very easy to install.
B005DOR2D6|1|Didn't even fit my truck
B000F6F99G|5|This is a very good device to aid you in parking your car in the garage in the same spot each time and it works for two cars.
B0089ZL3WC|5|Just as simple as it looks to install and looks great on my motorcycle. Very solid and stable once installed.
B006H81J04|5|Fast delivery and quality product
B00H456F7Q|1|Piece of worthless china made garbage. Proportioning  pressure not set right. Rear braking very weak. Brake light came on and stayed on. Found an original that was reman., and it worked great.
B00HRY2QP4|1|These shocks were great for 500 miles. The body doesn't settle after going through bumps & dips and it annoys the hell out of me. The worn factory shocks was crashing on sharp bumps but had no body motions. Waste of money. Worse yet, I paid my auto tech 3 times as much to install them. Do yourself a favor and get a quality set from a known brand.
B000BWEH6K|4|Nice quality to these. They were a bit bigger than I had anticipated but that was my fault for not measuring.
B00EDQ19EI|1|Had the shock on my suburban for less than 1 months and the boot wore through. Junk! I didn't notice dry rot before I installed it but maybe I missed it.
B00T0WKGRG|1|Perhaps in the hands of a professional installer this could go on easier but anyone new at applying window film is not going to be happy with how this looks when it goes on. I purchased one of the popular film application kits and applications along with the tint film.  The major issue is that the film is too thin to stay flat when handling it so it ended up crinkling up immediately, Leaving unsightly streaks and bubbles. After seeing the results of my Avalon insulation job, my way said &#34;what in the world did you do to your core? You are going to leave it like that, are you?&#34; 'Nuff said.
B00KFAUZ8C|5|Awesome looks great and easy to install
B00FQ2DZ18|3|It didnt fit correct, and wasnt as loud as i expected to be but sounds decent
B006D1GJNW|3|Good relation quality-price.
B00PSRORH2|5|We are droning to Las Vegas at this very moment and using the shade! Excellent coverage and really does keep the heart out! I totally recommend these car shades for your side windowS!
B00SCXCQV8|5|Works great on the mower.
B00T15QBS0|5|Looks great on my car and I proudly show my love of the show!
B004809X9W|3|I bought this, along with the passenger side mirror when the rear view camera on my 28' travel trailer got fried. This is a good product that provides a view along the side when towing wide trailers.  Be gentle when mounting though.  On the first trip, the knob for the suction got stripped on mine after 2 1/2 turns.  I had to use a big rubber band to help hold it in place because it came off when I got on the freeway.  The tether works well!  I like being able to adjust with the power mirror controls. The mirror could have been made larger, but after using it the first time, I understand why it is small.  At freeway speeds, the wind tends to push the mirror in, so you are having to adjust them out constantly. Because of the way the side mirrors are on my Toyota Sequoia, I had to mount the mirror as far out as possible. Otherwise, I could not adjust outward enough because of the edge of the side mirror enclosure. Because of this, the side mirror could not hold it in place at higher speeds.  It would probably be okay if it was mounted in the middle of the mirror. One other thing I noticed is that the suction cup seems to be right where I look on the car's mirror.  That is a little bit annoying.  Overall, I would recommend this product because it is inexpensive and does the job.
B00QNIFF44|5|I received the item within 2 days of ordering it.  It was exactly what I ordered and was in perfect shape when I took it out of the box.  I installed it on my truck in less than 5 minutes.  It looks great and really finishes off the truck (2015 F150 Supercrew 5'5&#34; bed).
B00YVQD4A2|5|Holds my aviators right within reach for when the sun decides to blind me. I spend most of my day driving for work and this eliminated me shuffling tools around looking for my glasses while I drive.
B004JPAE7G|5|Good deal. The hose I received for my 95 Tacoma 3.4 V6 was an OEM Toyota part and fit perfectly.
B0009V1WS4|1|Don't buy this lock!!!!!!!!!!
B001BNHY1S|1|The mats arrived heavily damaged most likely by a box cutter or something
B005VWYY7C|5|Arrived on time. Genuine Honda Parts as described.
B00A1K779G|5|Mighty
B001H1M4GY|5|GOOD
B00O0SRAK6|1|A headache to install did not have a user manual did not work at all had a professional hook it up but would not turn on no matter what he did. Very cheaply made.
B004WF4KQ4|5|Looks good, solid, Went on easily
B00S7T4WL4|1|Would not recommend took forever to receive and then didn't even fit.
B003CG9PIC|5|Perfect
B000CQ44XG|5|I have a toyota prius (2007) and these work perfect and are so easy to clean- I got to the beach alot and this helps me with everything as far as cleaning them and its so easy! will be buying for my mom!
B0009IQZH0|5|cheap :D
B00J6ZI4JE|5|Very ready to install. Did it by myself with minimal tools. Works perfect for me for 4 bike rack and luggage tray
B00ZJJP7WS|5|very comfortable, good fit as well & they look great! very satisfied...
B00JMHGV6O|1|Drawers are very poorly made and lids do not fit well.  One drawer the lid falls down inside the drawer it fits so badly.  Very overpriced and would not recommend this at all.  Very Poor construction from a company like Lippert.
B0006I0MV8|5|This window knob works great. I had replaced the original with a different knob and it hurt my hand when I turned it, this one does not do that. If I ever need another this is the one I will purchase.
B001TWD5KU|5|Works great
B004C65DYQ|5|Changed oil yesterday on our 2012 Toyota Rav 4 (6 cylinder) and this filter fit well.  You don't have to take off the small drain plug first if you don't mind a little oil getting on the tool used to remove the filter housing.  You have to be very careful where you put the large o-ring on the filter housing, look carefully when you take the old one out to see where it goes.  Also look closely after it is installed,  I did not do that and the o-ring somehow came out of its space and was sticking out.  The 2012 Toyota Rav4 6 cylinder engine holds 6.4 quarts of oil.  After I put oil into engine I went inside to eat dinner,  when I came back into the garage an hour later I had the pleasure of wiping up 6.4 quarts of oil off my garage floor.  My oil change that usually takes an hour took 6 hours, when you add in the time to wipe up the oil and clean the garage floor.
B00EDFM5QU|5|Definitely has made a difference in the trailer
B007TYB6DA|5|Great product!
B001G8AIMU|1|Does not have a charging indicator light so it will keep charging. the rubber boots on the alligator clips are super slippery. when you squeeze the clips they spin in your fingers and turn sideways. Yes it does its job and charges, but thats about it.
B001KQ43RE|5|Works great. It was a major improvement over the stock crumbling unit.
B000C2UCMM|4|fits well
B00CIZ3E2Q|5|Looks good very pleased
B00CF73C06|5|Fantastic brakes and they look great on my 2006 Legacy GT! a slight noise when you stop at first but having them for over 5,000 miles now, no complaints at all!
B00EQJ88U0|5|very good product, I would order again
B00JN1XGRG|5|Stylish antena with very good reception.

B000A8OK4E|5|Perfect
B003BZD03K|5|Item as described. shipped quickly. Would purchase again. A+
B00977GPA6|5|The product is great. Nice and reflective. I do not believe it is dot approved though
B00G2QM00E|3|I couldn't figure out how to program it and it did not come with instructions.
B006WQROE6|1|I received wrong item. Not same as pictured or in description as being the front hub. Not my fault but yet,  I have to pay 15% restocking fee and return shipping and this item is heavy. I am not happy.
B007VQULHI|4|If your blower fan is on the fritz, this is very likely the part you need.
B005FKBWF2|5|Exactly what I ordered and fit the car without any issues. Been on the car a month now and have had no problems, they work better than the original brakes.
B00029J4GU|5|Excellent bolt on and ready to go
B00WH6AKI2|1|stay away from this product. Very hard to install and aren't universal product.
B000E7YP82|5|Excellent product.
B00XC15WUW|2|They somewhat worked out for me? One application I used them on worked great the next project I used them on I got one that the wires pulled out and another the light strip broke in two which made those two pieces unusable?  They can be a bit flimsy to work with?
B008KZK4XU|5|Great fit for my car thanks
B001O7PNS2|5|nice
B001PNO4H6|4|I found this item is well built, but if you have arthro like me it's not easy to solder to the pins. You need blade lugs.
B001KSG2EO|5|nice
B0009TSBNA|5|Installed a few months ago. Super easy. Has worked out great.
B001C4SLMC|5|as described fast shipping highly recommend

B00EC0ZD56|4|Fit just right
B003SZ9APA|5|fit and works great
B0050EET8A|2|Item received damaged.  It had been used previously
B007HRRB1U|4|Great replacement, however, I did not get a white &#34;Carefree Weather Guard wrap to protect product when rolled up&#34;??  Did I get short-changed??
B00BQMBWY4|5|Solid heavy leather with breathable panels that make it comfy in warmer weather up to 85 degrees as long as the humidity is low and your moving.  Went for a hundred mile spin yesterday in 78 degrees and it was perfect. If I had to beef it would be the zipper is what I would think of as backwards but it is so cool I don't care.  A real solid piece of safety equipment
B000IY49DC|2|My mechanic said this is the old style and did not fit 2011 X3 even though Amazon's says it'll fit.  Maybe there is a mid-year refresh that changed the design.  I found out too late past the return period.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Super BLING!!!! Even after months of use and several carwashes it still outshines all other bling license plate frames. I LOVE IT!
B004GE4M7S|5|great part perfect fit.
B004K2NZ3I|5|Looks great on
B003WSN7DO|4|This cute sign looked nice on our car
B0077FIM42|5|Great quality!!!
B001FC7DUC|5|I haven't has any tank odor in the coach since this was installed.
B00GN0VBNQ|2|lights were too dim. They were easy to install. I kept them on my bike for a few weeks but several of my buddies told me that my signal lights were hard to see, so I want back to the regular bulbs. Anybody want to buy these? I'll sell em cheap! :)
B00ISKYBRM|5|Very pleased
B0006IX7W4|5|Work perfect for hanging lights.
B0017KJ0E4|5|These things are great! Installed on my 01 TJ in less than 15 minutes; and it only took that long because I also had to replace a bulb.<br /><br />They look awesome. A fantastic way to update and improve your rear lights without breaking the bank. Definitely worth it.
B003LDROGG|5|Arrived on time. Great price.
B0002STSC6|4|HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET  BUT I KNOW IT WILL WORK GREAT  AND BETTER THAN UNSCREWING THE SPARK PUG
B00S7S90K8|1|These bulbs simply did not work the solder connections at the bottom are too small and don't make contact with the socket. I ordered a 6 pack and received 3 two packs.  Maybe they fit some sockets but not a 2397 as advertised.
B00GUF74HQ|5|The tailgate assist is a great addition to the truck.  It was not difficult to install at all.  I don't know why trucks don't come with this installed.
B000C1LLCS|5|These are the correct replacement for many Hondas. Check to be sure yours fits, but it fits our 2002 Honda Accord and our housemate's 2010 Civic.<br /><br />I always used to put Bendix semi-metallic on my cars, but ceramic has come a long way. The metallic brakes will wear out your rotors, but the ceramic brakes are more gentle and will allow you to use the same rotors longer, saving you money. The formulation gives terrific stopping distance, so you don't sacrifice performance for economy. I was skeptical at first since I liked metallic, but I like these Akebono ceramic brakes better.
B00355QWOK|5|awesome
B006CF4RH4|5|great part fit perfect fit.
B000NCOKZQ|5|awesome deal

B000K3I7DO|5|Install them and are working great.
B004A675IA|5|Product was as stated.  Big improvement over original equipment. Installed at auto repair shop. Solved the clunking noise in steering on 2007 Dodge Ram 3500 4x4 truck. Would recommend to anyone having same issue.

B002UCYRZU|3|So, so product.
B004M02RGY|5|This thing is a beast and I mean that in a good way.  Also Westin customer service is the best.  I was missing parts so I called Westin, within a week the parts were at my front door.  Thank you Westin for a great product and great customer service.  I installed on a 2015 Ford F250 (XLT gas 4wd)- perfect fit.  One man job for 80% of the install but need a 2nd person and a jack stand for the final part.  I did need to reroute some wires but no big deal (thank you whoever invented zip ties).  Very well made product - I am very happy.
B00D3YEGO6|5|This is the bling license plate you've been searching for!
B0012TNKPK|4|Exactly what I expected. Delivery a bit slow, but when it's free, it is what it is.
B000A0EJ84|5|I assume it cleans the air
B005NLQAHS|1|Worked great until a few months in and then only a red light is on. This tool wass invaluable to me and now it breaks right after the warranty period. Sat in my car bump free. Even the picture for the product changed what does that tell you? NICE COMPANY I WANT A REPLACEMENT...
B0082365AQ|1|Arrived with a flat tire and a hole in tube. Still have not found a replacement tube.
B00RDT4A4I|5|sound very great as i expected and<br />fit direct no modify<br />no drone no noising no problem thanks god<br /><br />i installed on GMC 2015 RWD 5.3

B0048EOIRK|4|Fit was fair & quality was very good
B00N2DY6DY|3|It would like it more if it didn't cost so much.  A little larger than<br />I perceived it.
B00IRBPCEI|5|Just what I needed for small emergencies.
B001O7PNNM|5|Very good
B004RNJU16|5|Product as expected and received promptly.
B00VMU5LP6|1|Lights  burned out to fast
B00CZB9PFI|2|Too tight.  cut off circulation in arm.
B000F285EG|5|Got this for my step dad and he loves it
B00N9RQMO4|5|Great looking item for the red anodized TRD look.  Precise fit.  This ships from across the pond so allow 4-6 weeks for the part.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Just as advertised
B000STXWO4|4|It fits a 2007 Toyota 4Runner gas cap well. It will not rotate 180 degrees, but it is enough to tighten, and break the cap loose.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Great product
B00698FFKW|5|Works as described. Very small, so mounting options are numerous.
B00G186POK|5|Awesome leds gave my car a more modern look! Has a very long life, no flickering or dimming. Very easy to install. Very bright light and will give a nice ambient look to your car.
B00PAKHAXK|4|Comfortable
B004T60EV6|5|Used this for my 75 dodge D-100
B001OBKD9M|5|Excelente producto
B008CE0O8E|4|Works great on my BMW R1200RT. Secures bike very well. Secures bike up right while secure straps. Just a little difficult to back  bike out of, got to pull like hell to get out of the pocket. Great well built product.
B00UGNBJOW|2|it is very small!!! I really like the sticker but is very small 😓
B00PT18QAQ|5|Good product and well built! A real quality tire gauge.
B00TT7JM04|5|Great product
B000CMIWGU|5|Sturdy light bumper. Easy install for the most part. Mounted on 98 Ranger which took some work. Line up and measure 3 times!!! You might want to drill holes a tad bit larger to help line up when tightening down if offset a bit. Love it
B00EE56UAG|3|Works ok.  Quality of locking mechanism could use some improvement.
B004RCKKM0|5|On time and as promised.
B0002SRDQO|5|works great
B00RW7WF0W|5|Great aero wiper blades. Fits the jeep perfectly
B009S5EIPQ|4|Product as described
B002VH6S7Y|1|Made in China.

B00JBH0S1O|5|fits, no problems
B008YFTJTG|5|Bright, easy to install and at a great price! Thank you for a great product!
B00CE4TFRY|4|I love taking a nice dump on the crapper
B00E0J07V4|5|THEY WORK GREAT
B00LX6QI0G|5|My husband loves it!
B00OFU33PU|3|I returned this cargo organizer because I needed something that was taller and could hold my groceries better. I always carry a few towels, tools, walking shoes, sunscreen, bug spray, etc. I was unable to have these in this and also have room for six reusable grocery bags.
B008BLFHS0|3|Cheap vinyl but that part I can get by. I was hoping this would make my fog lights appear more yellow. Makes lenses yellow but does not tint the light at all.
B00JH25PTI|5|Perfect drop fit battery for my motorcycle.  Started right up and have no incidents Thanks!
B003O6P4PI|3|Haven't had them installed long enough to see how well they last. I was satisfied with how quick they were shipped.
B00G70Q3KS|1|Don't buy - this is barely a close facsimile of the G37 grille.  It's missing the corners in the mold, the bars twist side to side, and there are bubbles and other malformations in the plastic all over the face of the grill. It has none of the sharp edges of the factory grille. Cost $55 to send it back to get a return, so we are out money on this piece of junk.
B00JK324Z2|2|They come in a nice little bag, which is convenient. The handles are exposed on the bottom, that does not seem safe. They work as they should.
B00HHNHATW|5|We used it on a 2003 Kia Sorento.
B009TC8I4A|5|I needed a smart charger for large (200AH to 800AH) 6V batteries, such as are used for golf cart and boom lift and renewable energy applications.  This is the only 6V smart charger that I could find on the market, and it performs very well.  With manual chargers you always run the risk of overcharging and damaging the battery.  I wish they manufactured a 6V/12V/24V/48V version of the product, so that batteries could be charged either individually or as a bank, but they don't yet.  They do have a 6V/12V/24V version, but for no apparent good reason it costs a lot more, so I purchased this model instead.  Despite what another reviewer indicated, this product is reasonably well made for the price.  If you want something which is indestructible and can be dropped out the back of a pickup truck, it would weigh a lot more and cost a lot more.  The display is good, the power switch is good, the clamps are good, and there are nice rubber strain relief bushings where the cables exit the enclosure.  Yes it is expensive, but you get a well built, easy to use, and very useful product.
B00AWYCBBA|1|The product arrived broken. The spring which holds the switch cases open failed literally with 2 minutes of opening the package. Im actually scared at how long these actually last let alone being hooked up to your car. I hate to slam with such a harsh review but the quality and detail on this product is poor.
B00X4S6C1Q|4|Very cute but very thin. Do not know how they will wear.
B00P9JAMSM|3|An OK Jacket. Problem is quality control on Tourmaster's part. On Two different jackets (I returned one) scuff marks on the ends of the sleeves where the stitching is, one has two bad imperfections on the back of the jacket, not quite scuff marks,  like the jacket was stepped on with a high heel, the other one is a pinch or a press mark around the collar....and some weird silver colored specks along the shoulder blades on the back and in the imprint on the sleeves where it says &#34;Tourmaster&#34;. Just poor craftsmanship on Tourmaster's part.....wish I would have spent more on a Dainese.<br /><br /> I guess it'll get scuffed at some point, and bugs and rocks will hit it, but for $400, I expected better, since everything I own from head to toe has always been Tourmaster, and I never had a problem. This is really soft, nice looking leather, not what I'm used to in a riding jacket. I don't know how this is going to look after it gets wet a few times. The leather Tourmaster's I've had in the past are real hard leather, and water proof, water just bounces off.
B000EDOT8C|5|A Must have for RV life
B009XQKCQY|1|It was off by 1.2 volts to low.  I suspect that the LED causes a draw
B00BJMIGOK|5|I added the included sticker to the back window and I dont normally advertise for anyone; enough said...
B0088P06AS|5|This stuff is great if you're doing automotive work involving adhesive tape for trim. Don't tape without it.  These tubes can dry out over time.
B0066CID0K|1|I've purchase Schumacher products in the past and been totally satisfied with the quality and prices of their products. The 12v plug on this cooler gets so hot you can hardly touch it (cheap) and eventually the cooler stopped working, ruining the food inside. While it was working, it condensed water that dripped down on the food in the cooler and puddled at the bottom.
B0063CU2QQ|4|Quality product however directions could be more detailed. For example, how far up or down the hood is the correct mounting position? On a 2014 Civic Si Sedan, you will have to drill holes and use the self tapping screws. Make sure you know exactly how you are going to mount it before you drill. I spent a 1/2 hour getting it &#34;right&#34;. The Civic hood is not really symmetric underneath so centering was a little difficult. You are better to measure each end of the Carflector in relation to the edge of the hood to get it centered. Also, the tabs are so thick there is barely enough room to close the hood. I ended up using the little bump stops they give you designed to be used as a barrier between the Carflector and the top of the hood ) as bump stops between the bottom of the hood and the top of the headlights because I was afraid of the hood cracking the head lights. My hood is wrapped in 3M carbon fiber vinyl. The Carflector definitely helps deflect debris away from the hood. Mounting is very solid. Just take care in drilling your hood. Happy motoring!
B000FW61EW|5|AWESOME!!! My back glass in my convertible on my BMW was all but complete out.  Took us a good hour to get it done and done right but this glue has got to be the best on the market after seeing the end results.
B00080QHMM|5|I have owned dozens of tire pressure gauges in my life and absolutely love this product.  First off, it is accurate and easy to use.  The handle is also perfectly angled.
B007V2BPIG|5|This is probably the 5th covercraft we have ordered when we get any new car. Works well and keeps the heat away.
B00JH25GLU|1|Doesn't fit a 2012 kawasaki ninja 650. Asked for a refund or an exchange for a battery that will fit, haven't heard anything back
B00UHD4HJA|2|Although these are stickers I wouldn't recommend them for kids. Some were obscene and some political plus a lot of stickers advertising products.  We ended up editing them before letting our girl actually put them anywhere.
B002R1G7T8|5|Excellent parts for your Toyota 4Runner, I ordered a set  for my 1996 4Runner and they fit great look great and function great at a cheap price. I'll definitely buy more from this company
B00KL3ALGO|5|We LOVE our shades! They are super easy to put up and take down, making them very convenient to move between cars or to different windows. The shades are large enough to block my baby's face. I would tell every parent to buy this product!
B001KS6FPK|5|Two year old Mazda CX-5 needed 24&#34;,18&#34;, and these 14&#34; blades as replacements. Easy to install, exact fit. Good investment in auto and your safety sot you can see the road, have clean windows for better visibility and know they will work in the rough weather that comes to all. Good value for your money.
B00VJBTDE8|2|These are large, and encapsulated in silicone. I wasn't so concerned about the size because I'd seem other reviewers say the same thing. The prongs were pretty close, but not exactly the right distance apart, which says something less than excellent about the manufacturing tolerances. I was able to bend them slightly apart to get them to fit into the receptacle, then bend them to tilt a bit since the bulbs are too large to fit into my puck fixtures.<br /><br />The bigger problem was that out of the 6 bulbs, 2 didn't work. I returned them and bought a different brand.<br /><br />The color temp was great-- just what i was looking for in a daylight white.
B0055AZEMY|4|Good fit, works -- When did AC Delco move to China
B00BFDFSSA|5|Great condition, I had both of them inserted by a machine shop ($40) total labor.
B000IZ5ERG|5|Great horn. Sound is exactly as original horn. However, the connectors are not plug n play. They are different than my 07 tahoe. But if you know how to hard wire them, they're a great replacement.
B004UARUE0|5|My Therapy Dog Pumpkin and I have been working for the past five years.  This sticker is the best one I have ever had.  People don't tailgate anymore due to this sticker.  I love it.  It is easy to put on and had been great through every washing.  I have it on the back of my Tundra Pickup Truck and it is wonderful.
B00C6OPQVQ|2|Very perfumy smelling. Not as fresh as described. Hoping for a grassy scent but just smells like your typical run of the mill car freshener.
B009MASZ1K|5|It gets a little crinkled up after keeping in rolled up, but it straightens out real nice.  It fits perfectly and keeps the hot Dallas sun off the dashboard.  The interior is noticeably when you get back in.  Glad I bought this one, worth the money.
B003SS62PS|5|I live in Texas and I have no air in my truck. The<br />Hopkins SP570804 Go Gear 12 Volt Oscillating...<br />Hopkins  Works for me
B0007N20WQ|5|We first used Gliptone a year or so ago based on good reviews. We have an old leather couch that gets direct afternoon sun. It was in bad shape. We used these products on it over a year ago and they really improved the condition, a year later the couch was still much better than when we first treated it. With the latest treatment the leather is soft, supple and looks great.
B0001WW37U|5|Its your regular old cd holder. I like the material where the cds are stored. It seems like they wont be scratched in there.
B002SINBRQ|4|It works.

B008M22I0I|1|No fault to husky I ordered from amazon warehouse. I have the husky floor liners for the front of my truck and love them. I was hopeing to get a good deal and ended up with the wrong product.
B00IELYC24|5|Came before time said and Yes! Yes I will buy another when I need one , very nice make my Rogue STAND OUT!!!!! thank you for sending early
B000GTXD4K|1|Well, the lenses are really small and I didn't like them at all so I gave them to my 9 year old niece and they suited her perfect but within the first 30 minutes she lost them and they're nowhere to be found. Anyway, I don't recommend these glasses. However the 20% larger yellow lens pair I got are great and I will be using those for night riding from now on
B0051D3MP6|5|Great for the truck we only drive once or twice a month. The heat and the cold keeps sapping the battery and it will not start after a week or two.
B0093SUHEO|5|Bought the mirror for a 2002 Chevy suburban  and it fit perfectly! Thank You Guys!
B0069SMLRC|2|Leaves white marks when the correct dosage is used with distilled water.  Removes bugs if you JUST hit it,  but won't touch an overnight dry bug.<br /><br />Smears like CRAZY,  it seems hydrophobic but the water kind of becoms opaque after hitting a windshield coated with it.<br /><br />Wouldn't have again.
B00EG779AM|2|fell apart just changing the spark plug
B0043SCBD4|5|Great price, fast delivery,
B000C5EAOA|5|Fits perfectly on my Cadillac CTS.
B002HTGWUE|4|Easy to use, durable, I have being using it for yeas
B00L8417NQ|5|Perfect fit for 330ci with mtech.<br /><br />There is a logo on the glass like DEPO, but over all, i like the product.
B009WE8Y6C|5|good quality
B003GD5E3G|4|Super easy to install on my 01 TJ. Honestly, I haven't noticed much, if any, difference in performance or fuel mileage. It may run SLIGHTLY smoother after install, but not enough to be certain. Maybe it does something, maybe not. But for the price and ease of use, it's worth a shot.
B00LPIKK38|5|Excellent product and seller.
B002GV3026|5|exactly what we needed, just in time.
B0031GTBRS|5|Ok no issues
B000M65P9I|5|Great Deal, no issues..
B00QFY2BCK|3|Works, but fog came back 2 weeks later. Will probably have to keep using it over and over again. I thought it would last longer.
B00LMQA5VU|1|Producto equibocado
B00B00HWNC|5|It was a perfect fit on my 2003 WRX Wagons factory rails. The price is fare and the product is solid. I will be buying more of these.
B00394N9J8|5|Great Price! Just what I was looking for.
B00E6VM7HS|5|Good quality product
B0024E2POE|1|Seriously I expected to get a nail that was 8-10&#34; long not a freaking 16penny nail !!! Rip off dont buy. Go to lumber yard and get some gutter nails or 40d pole bard nails.
B00I8IU150|5|Installed it myself in the Fit, easy as pie. No reason to ever had the dealer do this job.
B006X98A7C|5|Worked as expected !
B000BGM240|5|Fit perfectly.
B00THGM71S|1|i know this balastros is a false is not a 55 watts is not protective, is not good balastro.
B000X4MRDG|5|They look great on the bike.  They are too loud for me.  I have to wear noise cancelling earbuds.  Essentially no baffles and when I called Cobra they indicated that they came with the best they had.  I added some after market baffles and they made a difference but still too loud.
B0023VFHYS|5|Product was more than expected. Made in China, but looks exactly like the original. I thought I would have to buy bulbs but they were included in the assembly. I would recommend this supplier.
B0049DY5MS|5|Just what I ordered shipped fast easy to install
B00XIMJG84|3|Doesn't work real well because its clarity isn't the best...pmd/Az.
B0081S9EKK|4|Part does not match picture as advertised but works
B00GSAUHB8|5|nice quality, couldnt ask for a better product
B007Y86BU4|5|good  product
B002UCAELQ|5|Worked exactly as I had hoped.  Great
B00DVEETRW|5|Fits the Jeep like a glove. Solid rack system. Carried 2 kayaks without issue this weekend.
B00BFUFT2S|5|This stuff is great. It lasts for several washes and never turns brown.
B008HZMNK0|5|Nothing but the best!
B00QI7F1FI|3|This net is not quite what I had hoped it would be but I'll keep it.  However be advised - when you take it out of the package, you will need to air it out for a couple of days.  The harsh smell is almost overwhelming.
B005TTZ64M|5|Well made and easy to install.  Be sure to use the correct size/type of tap and drill bit.  I used the wrong size drill bit for the tap I was using and broke my tap off in the frame.  The best way is to use a bit that came with a set.  I ended up buying a Hanson bit and tap that were packaged together to finish the task.  After installation, it was easy remove and place them on the hangars.  The only thing that I noticed was the sway bar itself doesn't have anything to keep it from drifting left and right but it didn't seem to affect performance.  Love JKS
B00M9NJCU0|5|Nice seat
B000667QL4|5|excellent convenience and works great!
B00OJBD2CE|5|Received quickly and product was just as described.
B000CQ6G64|4|Bails too long
B0050Z9N30|2|Instructions are very poor to begin with, add in terrible translation into English and you're left with a so-so product.  This is not what I was expecting and I will be returning them.
B001C3VQKW|5|I have used these for years and the quality is still amazing.
B00J5E9FJO|5|WE just drove 5600 miles with our BIgDog Chopper and my 03 Dyna Low Rider, didn't have a single problem with these Lock 'N Loads keeping our babies safe and soundly in place.  Very pleased with the ease of loading and unloading and the security of the products.  GREAT PRODUCT!
B0042ORWNI|5|repaired an intermitent noise that was occuring.
B007TJXHZA|5|As advertised at a reasonable price and delivered in a timely manner.
B001KR3FM2|5|Excelent.
B007PBPI68|5|My plan was to use  one of these lights on my sportsbike  rear ID plate but they are just to bright thinking about putting them in front and using them as fog lights
B001SLEPB0|5|Love it!
B003025J8I|3|Lights are good new screws they send are junk
B00IFD5TPK|5|so far it is doing a great job
B00B2WOMSG|5|Great ligh
B00826OVWW|4|Replaces an old sofa cushion. Having wheels means I don't have to squirm the cushion around anymore to get it just right.  Add that now I have a work chair which I also don't have to move around to get it just right.  Just wished that as a creeper it was longer but you adapt to it.  Fine steel construction.  I'll guess that if it was longer it would mean more steel and therefore heavier. Folds low in creeper mode allowing you to put it away anywhere.
B0049JCFKQ|4|I was a direct replacement for the one that went bad on my sons truck.
B00DQU9Y94|3|Well not two bad . but ?
B00JGC55XK|5|Great product for the price... cut a little small if you plan on wearing with a hooded sweatshirt. Shipped on time and was delivered fast
B00CHDEGEE|5|worked very well, the surprising thing about this mirror was it is reversible it is mirrored on both sides so it works for driver side and passenger side, but its not advertised this way and some people charges more for one side than the other.
B00230CVS4|5|Great product
B00E9BF0QK|5|very easy to install and works as described.
B00RC2JBY0|5|The decals were fresh and easy to apply.  My coworkers at the shelter love them.
B007V2BCCK|5|Perfect fit, well made, great value.  I ordered one for all of our cars.  Leaps and bounds ahead of the flimsy ones you see in the auto parts stores.
B002R4V9V6|5|A very comfortable shoe. Very light weight shoe.
B00E58J8GK|5|Product works great
B00IJ0E702|5|They won't even come close. Love it! Good to discourage tailgaters from tailgating a new driver. Easy to apply and adheres well so far.
B002UC2V26|5|Great fit and finish.  Works as expected.
B0068FWM70|5|excellent product.  The lube has excellent tack and film for my engine rebuild.
B00BITL7OK|5|Fast service and good price
B000HD6G7G|2|this picture is wrong. its not the same press. the press still works for what i need it for, but its not as good as something that is shown in the pic. The one in the picture has guides and a more robust frame. I'm disappointed, but it would cost the same amount for me to return it as it did for what i paid for it.
B001UCEUZI|5|workgreat with a wonderful price
B004940ZNK|5|So extremely easy to install that I cannot believe GM made something so easy. I mean it's just not like them!
B00KTIUNPU|2|It worked perfect for two days then stopped
B00FNP3YBE|1|Didn't work
B001C5CPR8|5|Natural and works as advertised. I use this for my ski mitts and reapply a couple times a season. It keeps the mitts in good condition and waterproof.
B000BQWHDQ|5|This is a great help for a crappy job, worked perfect
B00FSC457E|5|On time and does the job. I'm a satisfied customer. Thanks u guys.
B00FM7UFI8|5|Love i, I got it in less than 2 weeks and they are both exactly how I expected, can't wait to wear it out! Yes buy!😄😄😄🙌
B00AQIDXVO|5|Everything was great with my order!!
B000C9H5XO|5|Perfect fit
B000CCQ1AY|5|Works fine, need to trim the radiator shroud 1/2 inch or so. It's on a 2001 496, everything if fine, good product. Could come down on the price.<br />You can make this out of PVC from HD or LOWE&#34;S. Did it on my 5.3L. Get creative, save money.
B008F0TLDO|5|Great product! Works perfect on my 2016 Mazda 6!
B004K9KETY|5|Awesome and there too much suds i love it
B0048EBVI4|5|fits perfectly

B00C0NTSL2|5|Works great!
B00BRL6M7G|4|Great!! I wish the color gray was a little darker.
B00MBA5VNS|4|needed to add an extension line so it would reach my cigarette lighter in car, other than that, I have had my light for a couple months now. I will be looking to replace the standard magnets though, in town use...no problem, but would be hesitant to have to go down back country roads
B00DZ35AMW|5|I bought this to replace a Harley battery that failed after just a few months. It arrived promptly and worked perfectly when I installed it in my V-Rod. The main reason i decided on this battery is that it is Made in the USA, unlike the Chinese crap Harley sold me.
B00AFTMJAA|3|Faded quickly.
B000HRF04M|5|very satisfied
B000VNAIQ2|1|I follow the directions exactly and waited the prescribed amount of time. When I went to adjust the mirror and immediately fell off again. Doesn't work.
B00OZX4NZG|1|Came off in the car wash.... Didnt realize till i was 15 minutes away
B00V2FM2QC|5|I looks awesome, Thanks
B0068ERNNE|4|HAVENT TRIED IT YET, BUT THE FIT IS GOOD, AND IT APPEARS TO BE WELL MADE.
B000EVWDAK|5|Awesome tool.  Downloadable updates, ABS fault scans, what could be better.
B00873J0YY|5|Fast shipping and great price
B000GU0MMU|4|Very useful tool
B00K7X8QQU|5|Top Quality all the way #1
B001QUHFQA|5|It did everything it was suppose to do.
B000C57O7K|5|does what it's supposed to do!
B007FHS3ZK|5|These caps look great, I have black handlebars and these caps fit in well.
B003N5IHHM|5|Got this as a gift for my wife's car.  She was thrilled.
B0066QMMDA|5|Arrived on time fits perfectly. I've had no issues with this.
B00407YOPQ|5|The name is appropriate.  The color was a perfect match for my truck.
B000GV2JU2|5|great product
B001P22OY2|5|Worked perfectly for my bike rack to clear the spare tire on my Jeep!!
B0006HP9F8|1|The screenshot for this product shows that this product is for a 6 cylinder truck (7 cables in total) but I received only 5 cables for a 4 cylinder truck). I need all 7 cables!!!
B007GDXK06|5|Just finished installing this GLOWSHIFT FUEL PRESSURE gauge.  High quality kit that  included all that was needed for the installation.  Very complete instructions, clear steps to follow. The different colors are ok.  Will most likely settle on one.  Would recommend without hesitation.<br />JimB
B0010GAY4A|5|Just like they said. It fit with no problem.
B00L4G91V8|5|did the job
B00199IXMS|5|The tailpipe arrived in good time and excellent condition. It fit perfectly.<br />Putting the truck up on jack stands made access much easier.<br />Eye protection kept us out of the emergency room (unlike the last removal and replacement of a tailpipe we did).<br />Very Good product, very good seller!
B005ASY23I|5|Works great and inflates the tires on my sedan in seconds.
B001GJ7HCI|5|Best microfiber sponge on the market. Used it with B.E.S.T. Bug-Off Remover and the bugs wipe right off with little effort. After I was finished I just rinsed the sponge in warm water and it was clean and ready to use again. No loose strings or threads hanging from the sponge anywhere. And I gave it a thorough work out. Purchased 2 of them and am going to purchase some more to have on hand. Excellent product for you car, boat, camper, etc. Wife uses the other one in the kitchen. She's sold too. :-)
B005NLQAHS|5|Works very well with my 2004 Honda CR-V, it should work with all Gen 2 and Gen 2.5 Honda CR-Vs (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 model years). It read the code and using the torque app, told me that it was my front O2 sensor (no suprise as I have 150,000 miles on it and the front o2 sensor usually goes bad at around 120,000) It gives a good amount of data but not everything, most importantly it certainly reads the codes well. Connecting to bluetooth was a breeze, with zero issues whatsoever.
B00APO9YQM|5|Good chrome job, smooth and clean. Came with chrome covers for the screws which was an unexpected bonus.
B001KQEO8W|5|Saved $15 by doing it myself.
B00OJN8E5C|5|Great Deal!
B001F1U5D0|5|Nice jump starter. Helped me couple times. low profile and it's true.
B003MHZSEQ|5|Perfect, needed it badly
B00U9PRXOC|5|I am so impressed, the head is so detailed and looks tons better in person. Everyone loves it,  The price was really reasonable also.
B00HY35DDU|5|love it it is for all  the love ones that I lost
B00BLZ97SY|4|simple and effective, might have to do some creative arts if you use an expensive brand bulb as they will not fit properly inside these, they still worked very well.
B001CEG90I|5|It fit our 2012 Toyota Rav 4 perfectly.  Easy to install.
B000ZFPVRW|1|DISAPPOINTED!!!  same happened to me,,,  Item is not what is pictured!!  It is only the light bulb ass,  Not the lense that is pictured!!  DISAPPOINTED!!!  If you are going to sell a product show a picture of what you are selling  DISAPPOINTED!!!
B001EOV46U|5|Simple tester to see why the hell those trailer lights aren't working AGAIN!  Or, at least to point in the right direction.
B00NLPQ5L4|5|Cute but didn't fit my truck... Nissan murano
B00AUENTD6|5|LOVE ANYTHING BETTY BOOP.
B00CSBY6LS|4|Works well except sometimes the end becomes unscrewed shirting out the receptical
B000CIPINY|5|This worked great on my 1998 Jeep Wrangler
B00ZN2Y0GK|5|I was offered this Abtech Bluetooth headset, at a discounted rate, in exchange for leaving an unbiased review. I have a brother who rides all the time and thought it would be a good gift for him. So after receiving it, I asked him to help me review it by taking it for a ride before I let him know it would be his (best way to get accurate feedback). Here's what he had to say about it: &#34;Fits in the helmet fine, Never lost connectivity during a 30 min. ride, Very clear sound for music and gps navigation, phone call was easy to accept & understand, I'd expect to pay about 80 dollars for it.&#34; I called him in the middle of the ride to check the clarity of the microphone; it was unbelievably clear and easy to understand what he was saying while going 50 mph. When he got back I put his helmet on and agreed wholeheartedly with what he had said. The functionality of it is very simple and it does offer a very clear sound. Once I told him how much it costs on Prime (50.99), he was shocked and asked me to order him one immediately. It thoroughly impressed him for the price, as I feel it will for everyone! Highly Recommended!
B007R5WA04|5|Matched s*** knob very well!!
B00KRQFA02|5|F*** Y** Terrorists!  Good sticker, MY military, Redneck, and Red Blooded American Friends love this sticker.  Did I Mention .....F*** Y** Terrorists!
B000786GLM|5|Works great
B00EOTE8BA|5|This is not a very durable entry lock. When I installed it for the broken Tri Mark the door handle lock was to close to the screen door so had to remove the door lock knob. The striker plate was built into the door jam so had to remove the striker pins from the old latch and put them in the new one so made the job much easier.
B0074EJ4RK|5|Just as described!!!!
B00BFDG4QU|5|This product matches perfect with the orginal Honda Fuel Cap.
B00ODM4I90|4|These work great for my boat,  only giving 4 starts because they have an offensive smell.
B00B1G7KAA|5|Arrived quickly and good quality knife
B0002RNSKK|5|Fits my 2012 silverado perfectly. Plugs in smoothly. You dont have to force it.
B00GR2WBRK|5|great decal

B0046ID5EK|5|itworks tks
B003YLMPPA|5|Two years after I bought my 2006 Jeep Unlimited, the first two fan settings for the four speed blower quit .  Two weeks ago the third setting went, leaving me with only high-speed for the blower.  After watching YouTube, I found out this was the part I needed and how to replace it. It works like a charm.  It's fixed the problem I was living with for seven years. I highly recommend it.
B00GHTEEUA|5|Fits perfect as mentioned.
B00537FBIG|4|Fitting was a struggle, had to buy and use washers to fill in gaps to frame. Otherwise, It has worked out perfect
B001PYU7CQ|5|Great fit
B00EEANEGO|1|This does not fit the ABS model.
B000CNLBIU|5|Can't go wrong with a Flowmaster Muffler.  Although I didn't install yet, it came in extremely quick (shipping), was very affordable, and can't wait to get this thing into my truck!
B002UC8QE8|4|very pleased
B000C7YLM4|5|Direct fit, works well. The only thing is that Honda has break off bolts holding the old switch in, so you have to either cut a slot in the top and attempt to unscrew the bolts, drill them out, or actually cut the old bracket.<br /><br />This comes with new wiring harnesses, if your current ones are good, you can just unplug them at the old switch and you avoid running the wires
B001V8U12M|4|Good tool to add to your rv toolbox. Turns your battery drill into a elbow saver. I'm not going to miss my manual wrench. Well built ,  and we'll worth the couple of bucks
B002R0O7PU|2|the picture showed wire harness attached part received did not have plug
B000XQO2SW|5|ty
B007UAVRV4|5|Soft and comfortable ...I would buy other colors too if offered
B002V9CGU0|5|It's was great
B007HTSIOC|5|The mats fit perfect in my Honda Del Sol. Very satisfied with the purchase.
B00E5OUOCQ|1|Did not fit.
B000L9AD2K|4|Great, compact, and powerful product. Life and time saver. Had a flat tire in rainy weather, tire and rotors were immersed in wet and muddy ground, no way to use jack on an unbalanced, wet and muddy ground. So left with limited option, coz of rain nd thunderstorm for last 3 days. I use this product on my SUV tire (245p). It just took almost 4 minute to fill the tire (90 percent). I had to use a ups box to get a flat stable, non wet surface.   It is almost as loud as gas station air filer machine. Didn't work on my car charging port but it did work on the cigarette heater port. Thts why i gave it 4 star. Still nice, compact, powerful, affordable, nd life saving product. 1st pic is with zero percent air 2nd pic 60% 3rd pic  90%in almost 4 min 4th pic is to show how compact is the size of the bag  compared to average size iron nd the entire product fits in that bag. This product size and bag is almost half the size of my dslr camera
B000CFO05E|5|I love this pump I have 3 of them on different vehicles they are a little slow but they will fill my shocks to 250 psi without too much hassle for really heavy loads or 150 for reasonable loads pretty quickly
B003VWOWXU|5|I love it!!!
B007P73QPM|4|Recommended!
B001GG09SA|5|On my new MiniCooper
B00474N160|5|Very cute!! Perfect fit. Great service from vendor. A lot of great matching items.
B004AS7AXS|3|After 25,000 miles it's still kicking, running over OM boost, running APR stage 1 (15-18 PSI) daily driver and I have been launching and abusing it, lets see when it goes, hopefully not anytime soon. ;)  Update: 40,000 miles and it has a huge exhaust leak (goes away once warmed up) and makes a giant squeeling sound when I get on it, it's pretty much dead, still spools up and has decent power but it's time to replace it, it was good while it lasted, going K04.
B00GM4WKJM|5|fast shipping. feels like high quality for the price. I foster/rescue dogs. This will get a lot of use!!
B00FJUZY8Y|4|Disclaimer - I would have issued 5 stars had it not been for an unresponsive seller.<br /><br />After seeing these carts in use at a commercial car wash I bought two to serve as replacements for rusting out garage shelf units.  One of them assembled very easily without the need to tap the posts into the shelves.  The other seems to have slightly oversized posts which required some effort to seat.  The instructions indicate they need to be seated with a rubber mallet, and that is exactly what I used, but that resulted in a stress crack on one of the shelves.  I contacted the seller for a replacement part via an automated email link they sent me seeking positive feedback, but I never got a response.  Thankfully, Amazon's no-nonsense return policy came to the rescue and I got a replacement unit with a return shipping tag.  In hindsight, a little WD-40 on the post might have helped it seat without cracking the shelf, however the posts on the second unit were unquestionably tighter than the first one. The carts are sturdier than I expected, very light, and easy to maneuver with the four large swivel wheels.  The wheels are large enough to easily roll over extension cords, sidewalk gaps, and other small obstacles.  Also, they're are made of non-marking material so my new garage floor won't get marked up.  I loaded one of them up with about 150 pounds of tools and it doesn't seem stressed.  I also like the resin construction which will hold up to the elements if I decide to leave it outside.  I have one loaded up with hand tools so I can simply roll it out to the driveway when I get wrenching, and another contains all of my detailing supplies, i.e. buffer, pads, polish, etc.  I plan to attach power strips with extension cords to them so I can have everything I need in one unit.  This beats the pants off hauling tools and supplies in and out in buckets.<br /><br />I am currently planning on purchasing at least two more of these in the near future and would only suggest yoube very careful during assembly to avoid the same mishap I had.
B00LIRY7VM|5|Love it fast shipping too
B0025CXPYY|5|Great tool, made job super easy to remove & repair
B00H554R98|5|Delivered quickly, worked as expected and quite reasonably priced.
B000ARPVQ6|5|Received filter quick. Install was quick and smooth. Will order again when it's time to service.
B00757KJTI|5|Great size, easy install. Now I don't have to remove antenna to go through carwash.
B000ED8UOG|5|Works great, competitive price
B00EQ57BE8|5|Works perfectly on my 2015 F150 2.7 ecoboost. Supports a lot of functions with proper setup - you must enter the correct weight (get it weighed ) of your vehicle to get accurate horsepower readings.
B000C46XC8|1|Pump seized solid 4 months after purchase, and took the belt with it. Had to limp home from a long trip. Faulty rebuild, and no way to return. Fiercely disappointing.
B001Y8XQAI|1|they were broken in the box and had to send them back
B00EK6HYFE|2|wrong color. it is lighter than the picture
B01264D2DY|5|THIS WATERPROOF COVER IS VERY NICE, THANKS 4 THE SHIPPING!
B009ANV81S|5|It is good
B0007ZA29C|3|gift
B0085H6J9G|5|works great.
B004LF90QK|5|This was a great up grade from our thetford aqua-magic v.
B0041U3LIS|5|Good quality and easy to install.
B000C01SIG|5|Combined these with a set of full set of akebono pads and a front pair of centric rotors (120.40057) and they're awesome. No noise, no dust, and my braking is way smoother than before. I will definitely be reordering these if I ever need to get more! The painted hub is very nice to keep the rotor rust free and looking great.<br /><br />My car is a 2008 Honda Civic Si 4dr if anyone has questions on the fit.
B000FQ7BN8|5|Great product, easy installation. Works great!
B000BZL0LC|5|This part was an identical match the one on my 2001 Subary Legacy A/T 2.5L . The PowerBuilt tool 648691 seems like a necessary tool for the job. I saw no other way to get to the O2 sensor without it. This is a 6 pin connector that matches the one on my subaru.
B00V9SIENC|2|These are not very bright compared to regular light bulb
B00R42ER0G|3|It worked OK, I downloaded the Torque Pro for my phone and it works fine. But this tripped the ABS test light on my 04 Tacoma and it started flashing when it's installed.<br /><br />I gave it a three stars until I can figure out how to stop it flashing my ABS light.
B005PD64T8|2|Not reliable as described!<br />But it's bright when it work's
B000CSWM5G|5|Great Deal, no issues..

B005XO5620|4|Husband bought a Mazda 5 for the family car.  We now refer to it as the Shuttle.
B00SBZRELY|5|So far so good - it works fine - looks like a well made product.
B00BFWBC6I|4|This is a good product. Works as expected. Easy to install if you have a tap and die set or adapter  to install the sensor.
B00II5YD4S|3|I purchased this for use in our shower, to squeegee the walls and glass. It does a nice job of removing the water with a streak free clean. However, it is incredibly noisy as it moves over a wet, smooth surface, with an irritating,  scratchy sound that changes pitch with the slightest movements. The noise reminds me of fingernails going down a chalkboard. My wife snd kids hate the noises it produces and complain how irritating it is and won't use it. Yet our cats seem to be especially fond of this new shower concert, flocking for front row seats a few feet away. Needless to say it didn't take long before I bought another brand (which is wonderfully silent). I'm keeping this noisy squeegee for my cars and house windows.
B000BWCFLO|5|This gauge actually has a 1/8&#34; NPT MALE fitting, which is what I preferred and thought I would have to buy a nipple to install.  Just right!
B00B03MGLM|5|This is exactly what I needed.  As others reviewed, the quality of the construction is excellent.  I am using it on my Kubota BX25, which I just purchased last year.  Love the raise and lower capability and the stability of the drawbar.  I will be pulling not only my utility trailers, but rigging it up to pull my sleeve hitch plow, disker and aerator/seeder spreader.  I'm new to using small farm equipment, but am enjoying learning the ins and outs of what works and what doesn't.  This hitch is making my experience much more enjoyable.
B00SDFFN2O|4|Great backrest for 2012 Kawasaki Voyager.  Easy install.
B00CTLGSZO|4|I think it it was very easy to install. The only thing i have trouble with is the grafic bar don't stay illuminated  i lose some bars.
B0006IX7WY|5|Purchased for use in our 5th wheel outdoor kitchen fridge.  It keeps the cans in while in transit!  Adjustable and easy to install
B00IMQ4XDE|5|Love it.
B00AQ48SOA|5|It was just what I needed for my Dodge ram 1500 to stopped the squeaky Noise
B000CF6RX2|1|Ordered to replace our existing passenger side, amd it was broke when we got it. Very disappointing
B008R0F6TK|5|Fit well for my son and myself.  He is 6' 2 160  and I am 6'4 235.  Will use this for snowboarding and skiing and tubing.  My glasses also fit while I have the mask on, this was important for me.
B000IY9I06|5|Parts looked quality but was sent these by mistake so can't review how they work.
B00F53FS6I|5|Description of part was precise and received in timely fashion
B00P2PO2WA|5|Works great in my Sea-doo HX
B00KMWNVV6|5|Loved it! I put it above my light switch in my house. Thanks!
B004AW7XYU|5|It's ok I had no problems with this product. I would order it gain
B00HZBA4OY|5|It is a good size and shows what I need it to say so that if someone walks up to my home they will see I have a security camera.
B00KJLMFW6|1|I purchased these lifts in August 2015.  This is NOT OME but does fit the car.  Unlike the original this opes slower and then hesitates halfway.  At that point I have to lift slightly and then it will go to the top and hold easily. In fact ONE will hold easily at the top.  Like I said, not an exact fit at the couplings, but it does fit my 2008 Smart.<br /><br />Okay - reduced to 2 Stars and it really should be ONE, but it does hold the hatch open, bit that is all.  I was hoping that maybe it would work better if I turned it around but this is basically crap on my car.  It does not work worth a darn!  I am going to have to go out and buy a better set of lifters and see if they work better. This was a waste of money!  On second thought two Stars is to high!  One is to high!<br /><br />This has gotten harder and harder to open.  Now, after 3 months, have to almost force the hatch open.  The seller refuses to take this back and exchange it or refund my money because he says if it holds the hatch ope that is ALL it is supposed to do.  There is no concern that it does NOT OPEN smoothly or even at all without force. ONE STAR IS GENEROUS  and should be ZERO. Seller refuses to stand by his return policy, beware!<br /><br />May 2016 - After numerous emails and conversations the seller is now refunding my FULL purchase price.  They agreed that something was actually wrong with the set of Supports I received after I went out and purchased new ones and reported HOW replacement Hatch Lift Supports SHOULD Operate.  MY new replacement Supports take one finger to open and then LIFT as if by magic to the full upright and open position.  When I took off the ones that were sent to me in order to return them, I noticed there was RUST on the piston where the plunger entered.  That might have been the problem all along.  Once the seller received them back, I did get my refund, except for the shipping I had to pay to return.  Lesson learned!
B000OZS9Y0|5|Very nice and easy to install.
B00ZY2AE6E|5|I have this on on my laptop. I love it! I have been using this for over 8 months now and it is still in the same condition as it was new. The fabric that is used as the cover is perfect. I have had the rubber covered types as a mouse pad before and my arm would stick to it. I love that this one has fabric.
B00480J4M8|5|Perfect in my 2010 cadillac escalade!
B001XCBCQK|5|Worked perfectly after reading reviews to tape the horizontal side bars to keep them from collapsing.
B0051ZIJKC|5|Super simple to replace and it works just awesome... Just note that you have to pull a vacuum on the system to check if there's any other leaks and before you recharge it with r134a
B0082GL0MQ|2|Does not fit. Leave a lot of gap at the sides.
B0074URRHI|5|Good
B001KS2QY4|5|Fit like a glove, delivered ontime!
B012PCHATO|5|Ive been looking for this piece everywhere! It fit my Panther Rim perfectly. Thank you guys for the fast shipping.
B00192JGA8|5|good product
B00MAMU7RW|5|Second one I've purchased, my wife liked the first one so much.
B00029KA8Q|5|Painstakingly time consuming to put on, but seems to be very high quality.  Fits my 2000 VW Golf steering wheel fairly well.
B00F1I314S|5|OUTSTANDING PATCH. I WISH IT WAS AVAILABLE IN A SIZE FOR A BERET AS MINE WAS STOLEN MANY YEARS AGO. JOHNNY.
B00MBECD1M|5|Work great and looks cool too.
B00BDOCWMQ|4|Excellent wheel cleaner.  Very strong, including the smell.
B00JJZ2GHW|5|Very nice vest. Inside pocket will hold a small revolver, but just one snap button on the pocket is questionable it you are active. Heavier material than expected, but that's pleasing to me. Great for Fall weather or outside work. Well constructed.
B00PC484MK|1|I like the design put the product itself is not the best. The bottom piece didn't bother to stick at all and the corners of the upper part didn't stick either. I even used rubbing alcohol before I applied the decal. Then I tried using a little heat to see if that would help...NOPE!
B00DO4WNV8|4|Worked well.
B000GU3KHE|4|Good quality. Good value. Recommend.
B005FQYSKW|5|Great hat and good price.  This is my third one.
B00IJG32PW|3|A lot smaller than I had wanted
B001L9KI56|4|Definitely helps with the cramping!  I like this particular design, it's short enough so when I have to turn it all the way around to re-position it, it doesn't hit the brake handle.  Wouldn't recommend using it when driving around the city, or when wearing a coat with long sleeves seeing as the cuff keeps getting caught on it.  Other than that, I think it's definitely a handy little gadget!
B00R1FG17S|5|It fit
B001GH1PU0|3|Works well but looks more greenish blue when lit
B009I6BZL0|1|Bumper immediately started rusting through supposed chrome finish. This is total junk. I am out my cost for the parts as well as the labor to install and remove the defective bumper and associated components. Worst experience on Amazon yet. I would give this a ZERO STAR RATING if I could.
B000WJA5ZY|5|Another Great  product of RAM Mount.
B000BYGD60|5|So far so good
B004A6GLMG|5|Connector not fit , but promptly got a return authorization so all good
B00FAICT9C|5|Great item and supplier delivered on time
B00A8VFEN4|2|Ok helmet. Liner is not removable and zero ventilation. A sweat box for your head.
B008DEUGB8|5|Perfect fit and quality!
B00MLZ8JZU|1|The wiring configuration is completely wrong and there was no paperwork to help with the re-wiring. I expected a simple installation but ended up having to cut the harness and re-wire it by trial and error.
B00L1CNWUQ|5|So far everything was good!!!
B00RJWTL1Q|1|They were only powerful enough to illuminate 1 halo on my BMW 328i.
B00ABZ7IDQ|5|Fits my bike perfect I enjoy my coffee on my morning ride to work.!!!
B00B27KM12|3|As described, but a really expensive piece of light weight stainless.
B000K0V81A|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B001B6L6GY|5|A great addition to my truck. I also added the reach bar that goes with these. Loved this so much I am buying another set for the other truck.
B003YMPMEA|5|Good product for a very good price.
B00FY90MH8|5|Came on time and look great
B00EUZLF6O|1|My Alpinestars pulled the stitching around the palm after only 6 races, no coverage from Alpinestars. Will never buy their product again.
B0016KH240|5|Strong, durable. What else do you need?
B0031I805K|5|I put these on my 2005 Chevy 2500 Duramax.  They went right on and worked great.  Can't beat them for the price!
B00OQTEXBS|5|Worked great
B000RZPNOQ|5|This is the ONLY vinyl cleaner on the market that will remove those pesky black spots! Unlike other name brand 'stain removers' - it isn't some glorified armor all tire slick based protectant. It is a bleach-like cleaner.<br /><br />I've tried everything and anything to get the black spots off of my Lincoln Town Car with white vinyl landau top - including - every other vinyl cleaner or specific 'mildew remover' available in local auto stores (yes...plural) - straight bleach, soft scrub, Comet. Nothing else worked to bring the top up like new.<br /><br />IMPORTANT!!! - You MUST scrub the top or boat seats (worked like a champ on my Bayliner seats) with an appropriate scrub brush or it won't work. If it doesn't work for you - it is because you either wet it down with water before applying OR most likely, you didn't SCRUB!
B001C6OYEO|5|nice part fir perfectly and got here quickly to.
B00FE0FNP8|5|Perfect, what more can I say.
B0038B48X8|5|Ive had them for like 3 yrs now and still look nice and bright led on tail lights too
B00R8MXKCI|5|Perfect fit.  Arrived in timely fashion had it swapped in within a half an hour.
B0028JLO3I|1|This mirror functions great if you want to see who is sitting in the backseat, but on my Nissan Rogue it is totally worthless because it doesn't show any of the exterior of the car!  Disappointed!
B008V2N2KE|5|Fantastic seller. Prompt, correct and priced very well.
B011JBAGNY|1|Don't waist your money. Ordered six and all going in the trash. Made too cheap to trust on a motorcycle. Cap falls of. Valve stem won't tighten up enough to stop leaking. Tried a known good valve stem and it wouldn't seat properly.
B000JWKE3C|5|Truck rides just as well as stock. Very simple swap out. Awesome price!
B004C6OBBC|5|Nice heavy pin.  Keep a few on hand.  Somehow they get lost easily.
B003IS3HV0|5|Works great I used it on some late 1800's dried up leather and it has softened them up.  This was on weather that was weather checked and brittle.  I would recommend it.
B000ALG86E|5|Nice cover for the money. Fits our BMW 135i convertible very well. We use the cover to protect the car from the cat and other things while parked in the garage.
B0023VBHZG|5|Good price, even included the bulbs!
B00J594B5C|5|works great
B0012WKCNK|5|This is my 3rd Go Rhino hitch step.  The previous 2 were destroyed by rear end accidents.  They were the sacrificial lamb in the accidents.  If I didn't have them I would of been totaled out.
B002XM5G70|5|great ,,fast  shipper
B00AHJZBCG|5|Love it.  Excellent high power light at a good price.  I bought it check the solar panels at night when we suspect a leak.  I tested it and it reflected off metal more than 200 yds away.  I can clearly see the panels and pipe joints in the dark as well as my entire acre yard.
B00OTDVS32|1|Great delivery.....  did not fit my truck wrong grille
B00H36XX6C|4|This is an excellent combination of high energy density battery and high illumination flashlight. I tested the product's claim that it charges phones about twice, and that claim is correct. It works with any device which has a USB key but is not as efficient for larger devices like tablets. The light in the battery pack is extremely bright; it came in handy during a recent power outage.<br /><br />More impressively, I used it recently for a 45-minute late-night run along the river on a moonless light when the weather had cooled down. I used my phone to play music during the run and the battery pack in my hand to light the way. I used it intermittently and yet periodically. It lasted all the time when I was out, and when I got back it still had enough power left to charge my depleted phone about 80%. That's impressive! In addition I love the futuristic looking design. Quite pleased with this product.
B00D5ZT6NO|2|I would probably love this, but I can't get the top off.  Got it loosened and ready to go once, didn't actually open it, but now it's stuck on, probably for good, and I haven't been able to use it at all.....
B00A01B4YA|5|look sharp ,love it
B0065FRBZ6|5|Good job
B00809X0FU|5|fit perfectly
B008KQG7EE|5|Bulbs work great, look great and we're super easy to install! Love the bulbs and love this company!
B0015RC8UC|5|fits as is it, got no problem!<br />nice having business with you...thanks
B00E3W7IM4|4|These look great but the double sided tape wears out after a short while! Not a huge deal but I wish they used something better than 3m tape. They still look great though!
B00P5X67PE|4|Very bright, only design I've used so to far that fills the reflector and mimics the stock bulb light pattern.  Hopefully they're reliable as well.
B000C9AMNO|5|great timely service
B00DZZEOLI|5|It was AWESOME a lot of people said they liked it Thanks Guys
B00KE8LSPE|3|For the price I was hoping for something a little nicer.  They do not sit very snug to the sides and I worry about them scratching up the car.
B00U8LN8F0|5|Never buy those overpriced &#34;performance durability&#34; belts this belt lasted me longer than any other belt i've had so far. And worked just as good if not better than the others.
B00WYI9SUO|5|Got this helmet for the color and the price. The Bluetooth was an added concept that really works! Loud and clear reception while using the Bluetooth. Get one size larger.
B00LEBLI82|2|The light these give off hurts my brain.  They do not use as much power as an incandescent bulb, but jeez.  Unless you want your camper looking like an alien abduction surgery theater, I would go for a more expensive LED with a warmer tone.
B00UZOGEQU|5|Carb was exactly what I needed.  Put it on fired it up and went to work.  Can't beat that.
B0049Z6VFU|5|OEM nothing like it. only thing is I had to paint it.
B001QIYAQ0|5|Works great
B004BTAJ2A|5|Very pleased
B001GRW3JC|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 Expedition
B00L4NHW7Q|4|These mats are very sturdy. The rear ones are a little big, but that is better than too small! Very good quality.
B000N9XF2I|5|perfect
B000W0KTMW|5|Great item 10 mm worked perfectly for Victory Vision. Had a minor incident with the locking mechanism, key was not inserted fully and i scrambled the tumbles for a few minutes. I would purchase again if needed.
B00MOIRFFE|2|The dimensions are larger than the original.
B00M0UUY04|2|I returned these after having them 1 day- I bought them to load heavy job boxes into the bed of my truck with a winch- the holes were too big and allowed the casters on my job box to fall into. I would like to find ramps made out of diamond plate with no holes and maybe 10ft long- For a motorcycle/ATV they are fine I'm sure.
B00AC6TR7Y|2|The grips look good however, the only reason I rated them low is because the don't fit my bars.<br />Going to have to return them.
B0039GUOSK|5|It was for my son and he liked it very much thank you.
B00LBIWIUA|1|Wrong fit.
B00K8VQEF6|4|Nice looking product - did NOT fit my 2015 F250 even though it was listed as fitting so I &#34;installed&#34; on my wife's Honda CRV and it was a perfect fit.  She was happy as I told her I brought for her and she likes the skulls.  Minus one star for listing that it fit F250 when it did not - 4 stars for a good looking cover.
B00MS9A33K|5|Great item. Fast delivery.
B003EMAKRO|5|Good quality
B0055HYS0G|5|This is the 2nd or 3rd time we have bought these filters.  We bought them for our 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee and now we buy them for our 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Great price also.
B001NN9G5S|5|Very well made and accurate camber / caster gauge.  Very easy to use.
B00V427GPK|5|Love this rear light ,  looks very classy and works great
B000C7M5YU|5|Worked like a charm.  It was a pain in the butt to remove the original one so I'm thrilled this one worked.
B0080E7KDI|5|Good price
B0046I3I8I|5|Excellent
B006QH56GE|2|i got this battery because my current battery was not enough for my 1000w rms 15's. This battery did not make any difference. claims for 700 amp draw, my amp draws 80 amps before the voltage drops to 10. I was expecting a lot more for a 170 dollars. My voltrage drop problem was later solved with a fraud capacitor.
B003V9TCW4|5|perfect
B00NS1IA78|5|fitment is perfect and made of metal, instructions with color photos really made the install idiot proof, i used the stock signals and license plate light since they are really bright as it is and now more condensed with this tail tidy, upgrading to aftermarket signals or plate light would be a breeze if i decide later to go that route
B00CSY1UMS|3|It was ok. Not very sturdy.
B0002STREU|5|works well for smaller snap rings come in handy a lot with tight spaces as well
B00HRSTJNW|2|These seemed great until I happened to see the tag lights flickering.  When I got a chance to checked them the next day, one was out and the other very dim.  Upon removal, no LEDs worked in the right light and only two in the lamp worked on the left unit.  Now I wonder how long the others will last since all the interior lights only stay on a minute or two at a time, where the tag lights may be on for an hour or more.
B000VXH88I|5|Works very well. Tight fit. I cut my battery wires from the OEM terminal, measured the depth of the holes in this terminal and stripped the insulation back from each cable.. fit perfectly and tightened down snugly. I also purchased the Negative terminal and it looks just the same. It was marked with the Negative sign (-) but it was another Positive terminal just like this one. It was too big and I had to bend and place a copper penny between the terminal and the battery post. Otherwise it works perfectly also. Folks, look at your batteries. The Negative battery post is ALWAYS a bit smaller than the Positive. This is a DOT requirement to keep from mixing up the cables.
B0016KFWGU|5|Perfect
B00757KJTI|1|Junk. Doesn't work as advertised!
B00YI3IGA6|4|ShadeSox provides full coverage for my little one in the car! It is extremely easy to install and I can take it on and off in a matter of seconds. The only downside is it can be a little difficult to see out of while driving, but I think that's he point of the shade ;)
B00GAFIKV0|4|The curtains are pretty good quality and they look great in the car!<br /><br />It came with two metal guides and two plastic ones. The 3M tape, like others have said is not very good, it did not stick to my plastic or leather interior piece even after a alcohol cleaning. So I did not use the curtains on the doors but rather installed them on the back window instead.<br /><br />It took some modification and a little cutting, but the metal guides stuck nicely to the window. I did not use them for their intended purpose but it worked great regardless!<br /><br />Overall, the quality of the curtains and guides are very good. The only thing lacking was the tape. I have had the curtains for a few weeks now and they block out the sun nicely and really do keep the interior a little cooler.
B00KL0M08Y|5|I actually found it cheaper at my car dealer, believe it or not, so I returned this one. It keeps my car cooler down here in Fla.
B00ERFGYGI|5|Product exactly as described. No complaints. Happy with my purchase.
B003UPUQVU|5|Just what the doctor ordered repairing a truck and these will work out very nice
B003BHIAOW|5|I was surprised to find that this cap fit both my Freightliner chassis RV and the Toyota Prius V! Works well. I only wish it had a security chain so that it couldn't get lost during fueling.
B000BQSIWK|5|Worked great - easy to use - no problems - this si what I wanted.
B00QYIG8QW|3|Love the switch! The actual wiring, though, was worthless. It wasn't nearly long enough, and was a bit confusing. So, I ended up tossing the wires and just rigged the switch using regular, straight +/- wires. Much easier that way. The switch itself, though, IS pretty cool!
B000UDILX0|5|Yup.
B00J57LEEA|5|Excellent match and product.
B000JFHMVQ|4|Good.
B000B6CVZU|4|good
B001NI7KE2|4|OK works good
B0019ID5XG|5|can be either NO or NC my application was to kill a electric fuel; pump in a accident if the engine had died, no oil pressure opens the circuit. Has the NC tab to let you run a accessory wire to engage the fuel puymp when the engine is being cranked but the oil pressure has not risen enough to operate this switch.; I did have a hard time finding a wiring diagram to show which tabs were which. ..
B000ZMWY2U|5|I bough this pump to install in my 2004 XC90 while I was doing my timing belt. It fit perfectly and is brand new and not rebuilt. It comes with the gasket and new bolts. The bolts have a sealant/thread locker already on them so it makes for an easy installation.
B0002SRGTI|5|This unit works perfectly on tie rod ends. I have also used it to separate ball joints. One tip, If you think you have applied enough pressure, tap the end with a hammer, and it will pop right off.  Well made and designed tool.
B00LMRLYVY|5|I loved it! Perfect on my 4runner. Came in fast and very easy to apply.
B004W4OM2M|3|Installation instrucrions are not available. Everything needed for installation is not included. For installation purchase But connectors and crimp all positive wires for halo and leds to a single power wire, splice into hot on headlight harness using but connector. Negatives for halo/led can splice into ground for headlight or directly to grounding screw on frame hood latch is on. Limited visibility compared to OEM headlights. It does come with bulbs already installed however.
B000WMPLJG|5|Fit perfectly on my drz400sm 2008 and even smoothed out the shifting due to its extra length. Its about half in longer.
B00OZSE67Q|4|Good parts
B00CMST108|5|While it is a tad bulky in the pocket it is tiny for what it can do.  I live in Washington and spend a lot of time driving over bridges so I felt this was a must.
B00Y5O6Z6U|5|These were exactly what I was looking for.  My old license plate screws were all rusty and staining my license plate so I wanted to replace them.  These screws fit perfectly to hold on my honda license plate frame.
B0006IX87S|4|Excellent product works great. Make sure that you flush it out before hooking it up to your RV.
B006C169L0|5|Fits perfectly in my Jeep Overland. Easy to open and close.
B00KQ3WR1G|5|The ramps really made entering and exiting my home so much easier.
B000AL8VD2|5|awesome
B00G620ZVU|5|Very bright!!
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great package, nice carrying case. Has all the adapters. Worked like a champ. I have several 12 volt machines, movers, generators and ATV. Sick of jumper starting using vehicle. Instructions are adequate but could be better.
B00J1ZAWE4|5|Perfect to refresh you old one...
B00COYNVPQ|5|Feels great, looks sweet.<br /><br />I had to get a steering wheel cover and because I am a huge star wars fan went with this one.  It was easy to install and feels solid.  Looks pretty sweet too.
B00M5CYW6O|1|Bought and used for little more than a month.<br /><br />The previous pump lasted 6 years.
B009DJTSMK|5|Did a very nice job. It was here Even earlier than expected. Packaged nice no marks/anything to worry about.
B005ZFUKCI|5|I have a 1968 Camaro dark blue and a 2013 Nismo 370z black. This product keeps them both clean and somewhat scratch free. Easy to use.
B001OMLA7K|5|Awesome awesome awesome. I'm so glad I got this. Keep rain out and breeze in. And also has zipper pouches for storage. Love it.
B004A6JA2O|5|works better than just a filter it takes Odors out
B000VEDEKS|5|Perfect fit
B00HSO479Q|5|Works as described!  Very easy to use.
B000KITSMI|5|Works fine!
B000ABADXI|5|Well made set that anyone would like to own.
B00PUY6FOQ|4|replaced the stock antenna on my 2015 road glide special with this stubby. Absolutely looks better on the bike. I listen to satellite radio most of the time though… So can't speak too much on the reception ability. Would recommend though!
B004I167GI|5|fits great, great time on shipping, no scratches or mess ups!
B000CN5NR0|5|installation was a snap and it makes my 2003 dodge truck look good.
B0097SDUTE|5|Could probably get these from Costco for cheaper price, but the stuff seems to work good on my car.
B000BUU5TU|5|Easy install as others have noted. I have seen an improved rinse of my black tank since I began using this, and intend to order another for my grey tank. I'm not sure how long it will hold up with head assembly being a piece of plastic that moves on another piece of plastic, but we will see. For the price, and the amount of times I will use it each year, I will be pleased if it lasts 5 years.<br /><br />I'll update this post in any case.
B001CKOA2Q|5|Love it
B000UKDRY6|5|perfect tool for the job.
B000M5YYIW|5|as described. Thanks!
B00GTNCXZW|5|Perfect!  Easy to install.  Exact replacement part.  Done in 5 min.
B002DOME1E|5|SUPER PRODUCTO
B00A0UTXZS|3|The flag looks good and the colors looks good. My issue is with the spelling of the country name on the flag. As you can see from the advertisement, The words &#34;British Virgin Islands&#34; have an &#34;S&#34; at the end of &#34;Islands&#34;. However on the flag, the &#34;S&#34; is missing from &#34;Island&#34;. That was the only issue. I emailed the company and they said they use a third party for their product. My suggestion to them is Quality.
B00U8RP7T4|5|These tools are a must for popping the inside door panels of trucks and cars alike. This set is made with the same quality control as a professional set that I've had for years. My pro set is a special glass infused nylon and I bet that these are too. Don't worry about bending these tools a little, they're designed to flex before you break something, and always return to their shape. I paid almost $100 for my pro set, and these are comparable in strength and quality. The nylon compound is used instead of metal to help prevent damage to your vehicles parts.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this item was purchased at a discounted price for reviewing purposes.
B0035R3X68|5|Easy to install,  worked find
B000FCRS0I|5|This is the second purchase of the resqme tool. Bought for husband.
B00OHHSK04|5|Very well built and great design with the on-off switch.
B00HZOUYUK|5|So far it has done everything they said it would.  I will edit the review if it blows up.  Or not.
B003C3SNA6|5|This is the second bottle I ordered.  It seems to make the engine idle quieter and seems to promote better fuel mileage.  I did not do an actual before/after comparison though.
B001G8AIMU|5|It is as described.  Thanks
B008HZM6S4|5|Great OEM replacement brakes for 2000 Audi S4.
B00JIEX722|5|Everything I hoped for. Super bright and installed just like factory equipment.
B00EUEJPSU|5|1st one was bent and did not line up to mounting holes. the second one was perfect and installed in a breeze using the instructions in the box and found online.
B0054FJEDK|5|worked perfectly
B000GD5FMY|4|Not blown away, but yeah good experience so far.
B00M9UMI6I|3|I prefer the kind with the brush. Works more easily than this I think.
B00819IUZE|5|They fit like a glove
B00J9VYMIM|5|Good, bright and fun to use.
B00DR4C3VU|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B000BWCFLO|5|It's a guage and should be fine as my fuel pressure should not be over 15lbs.  Will not install for another 3 months.
B00DOUQMBY|5|I ll get more next year worked great on my boat
B001EZ3T8A|2|It does not fit my 2005 Prius although the specs say it should. The bolt holes were off by almost an inch from the car chassis holes. I won't get back the two hours I wasted unpacking, attempting an install, repacking, and shipping it back to Amazon. The reason I gave it two stars rather than one is because other web sellers indicate that because the hitches are made from mild steel they can be flexed with force to fit, so maybe this is normal operating procedure.
B007CLSJRQ|5|Came as expected and fits my 2015 Outback well.
B00O4XUHAM|4|Handles are made well and install easily. Great addition to facilitate vehicle rear seat entry/exit. Good utility factor considering cost.
B009E9LX5O|5|Absolutely love this product. My husband programmed it in less then 5 seconds & it works wonderful!!
B00THRN0HM|4|Pro:<br />* Cover is thick but stretchable.<br />* 81 - 89&#34; Just fit on my Triumph Thruxton (cover should be 5 inches over, may want to add 5 inches to bike length when ordering).<br />* Front and rear elastic makes it like custom fit.<br /><br />Con:<br />* Didn't ship with a box, the cover has a small cut.<br />* Hazardous materials are used in cover.
B002VDXB64|5|nice
B00NPIRAUC|5|Great lift! Added a lot of weight from bumpers and running boards and it hasn't sagged a bit!
B00KGIDFNU|5|Great starter great price
B00DLZZ9BG|5|Nice sound and looks great under the hood[[ASIN:B00DLZZ9BG aFe Power Momentum GT 54-76204 Jeep Wrangler (JK) Performance Intake System (Oiled, 5-Layer Filter)]]
B00Y75QZD0|1|This charger is too loosely made,  it wiggles inside the car adapter in your car. I returned this.  i consider it faulty. because it looses its connection and will NOT work properly.
B000BOB3TW|2|It doesn't grip the fuse tight enough, and slips off. It needs bigger teeth on the gripping end.
B00NLMSHM2|5|It is a PERFECT fit for our Honda Civic!!!  My husband works for a concret company and this totally protects the car while he is out in the truck delivering mud!!?  Thank you!
B00NRLCATI|3|It is not very accurate
B0048E0MJI|4|This mat fit perfectly and is great protection for the dash of my car. It arrived very quickly and was packaged very well.
B0000AXPDU|5|Just what I needed.
B00F359R60|5|It's a good thing that I got this
B0048E3VQY|5|FANTASTIC!!!.I was going to get new carpet for our minivan from years of abuse by my kids. I saved over $500 and the mats cover all of the major visible areas.  I just can't say enough. .price...quality..effectiveness. ..WOW
B001UC36QM|5|Like brand new, I do not want a wheel wondering off my truck when towing 14000 lbs.  I replaced the nut and the lock wedge when I serviced the hub body on my Dana 80 axle.
B000I4JPZE|5|Do not buy this product IF you have a modern SPREAD-AXLE for easier towing...<br />This product is not tall enough and will not get the second tire off the ground.<br />I purchased and had to return this product.<br />5 stars for a great idea.<br />I wished it worked for my RV Trailer.<br /><br />Would buy again if they  made one that worked for my set-up.
B00GU423C8|5|Came in on first estimated day. Looks and fits great
B00XWQMORG|4|Works well and similar to original. Only negative is It has a trunk symbol instead of SUV window.
B00MAO6026|5|great prod and shipping
B007NMZVFC|5|Fits perfectly, looks nice, it's the same one as shown on Toyota's website for the 2015 Prius C
B0054YGOU2|5|Love it
B000C581WW|1|This is absolutely<br /> awful! It's a FAKE!!!!!!!
B00HEABWH4|2|Nice casting but no seals or gaskets so had to go buy at parts store grrrrr
B00BQYCKE8|2|These are soft, but the silk on one of the two towels I've used so far has already come off from the rest of the towel after just two washed.
B000BOB9F0|5|I used this product to seal a slow leak on my lawn tractor's front tire. The tire was already off the rim from lack of air pressure. So i just poured the contents directly into the tire instead of going through the valve. I then re-seated the tire on the rim and inflated. No more leak. The whole operation took less than 5 minutes. I have not lost any air pressure in weeks.
B005NLQAHS|5|This scan tool is so valuable to have when I need to get some detailed information while servicing my 2010 Mercedes Sprinter!  Today I used it to check the temperature of my transmission fluid so I could accurately measure if it had the correct amount of transmission fluid after a transmission service.  The fluid needs to be measured at 80 degrees Celsius for the measuring tool to be accurate.  Love this scan tool and it was so inexpensive!
B009OBVS2K|4|Water spots and associated etching need more than just some liquid magic and fairy dust. This product is the best I have found for really stubborn water marks. I have found that you need to really work on small sections at a time and follow the instructions to not let dry. Work the area, wipe off, repeat. It seems to be mildly abrasive, but not as fine as a good polish so I follow up with an overall polish before applying wax (Meguiars Ultimate series works just great). I will buy more as needed.
B00G2TV7OG|2|Not as bright as i was expecting.  Daytime it's hard to see the tail lights/brake lights and the biggest aggravation is they cause the vehicle to constantly indicate that you have a burnt out light bulb.  Very annoying.  I have ordered replacement bulbs with a much higher candlepower and also the ones that have the build in resistor that keeps the system from thinking you have a burnt out bulb.
B00N463A2W|5|I've had it on my truck for a month now and it still looks new!  Love this hitch cover!!
B00077LEVK|5|the best !
B00IDERU1M|5|I've tried several different products and this is the best.
B00JA3BMDW|3|works well; just wish it had more range
B007ZDDUCK|5|I clean a ivory leather chair and this really gets it clean.
B000C5HT9I|5|These go bad frequently in Rangers & F-150 trucks with tilt steering. The wiring harnesses pulling on the switch when the steering wheel tilt is adjusted seems to put more pressure on the switch than the switch seems able to endure. Fortunately they are very quick & easy to replace. There are only a couple of screws that hold the housing on, then a couple more screws & a couple of wiring harnesses to unclip to remove the switch.<br /><br />When mine went bad, the headlight-left-on warning buzzer would occasionally buzz when the turn signal was in use. I've been told when they go bad the windshield wipers sometimes turns on by itself for a bit, or all sorts of other intermittent types of problems can appear. I was ready to buy a cheaper brand with a lifetime warranty when Amazon had this Motorcraft (Ford brand) with damaged packaging for cheap. I hope this one will last for the rest of the life of the truck, since I seldom adjust the tilt. For those who are rough with their tilt steering & tear these up in short order, finding a brand that offers a lifetime warranty might be a better bet. If you must have a Ford branded (Motorcraft) switch, the Amazon price has been somewhere around 70% of what my local dealer was asking. I wish I could tell you how good the really cheap generics are, but I have no idea how long they last, only that they cost a fraction as much.
B001KVW6EQ|5|As another reviewer suggested, I was subtle in deploying this, but it saved me embarrassment on multiple flights, and worked just fine when we hit mild turbulence. The bag is good for storage when not in use too! I recommend playing with and getting familiar with operation prior to using so that when you're trying to be discreet you can make this a smooth operation.
B0091OE6K6|5|Highly recommend!
B007D5V4QY|5|Good product
B00QYBSO66|5|Really amazing and especially at night. Amazing think to brag about
B000GU3DCG|5|Great tire
B000C94EY2|5|This fits my 1998 Honda Civic perfectly and was pretty simple (but not quick) to install.  I bought the stainless steel model as it will outlast the aluminum many times.  Removed the tire first as the bracket sits directly behind it.  I definitely needed to replace the cone gasket.  The old one came off in pieces and was hardened onto the pipe nipple.  Had to use a wire brush and file to get most of it off. Be careful as the pipe nipple is rusty and will crumble if treated rough.  The old bolts were fine to reuse.  The old muffler had been on for four years or longer but the nuts came off ok with some penetrating oil sprayed on them.  They did not have springs on them, which made the reinstall much easier.  It takes a 1/2 in. deep socket or box wrench. Once you crack the nuts loose with a box wrench you can use a regular socket on the bolt head while holding the nut with the box wrench.  The hangers are very difficult to get out of the rubber holders, but some white lithium spray helped a lot (or even vegetable oil spray).  Don't use penetrating oil here as it may deteriorate the rubber.  Don't be afraid to tackle this project, it's not rocket science.  But please protect yourself - use a jack stand or concrete blocks to prop up the car.
B001C8WOLW|4|Work well but a bit overpriced for performance.
B0055AW0N0|3|I thought the actual cupholders would be a little deeper to accomodate larger drinks. And I thought there would be an add'l. compartment for a notepad and such. I was a little disappointed but I'll use it.
B000BGM7QS|5|as described. Thanks!
B00WZ9ZPUO|5|These fit my '04 GSX-R 600 perfectly. I bought them to replace my aging stock leavers, since the adjuster didn't really work on my clutch lever anymore. They are a little lighter blue than I was hoping for, but not bad. A darker blue would match my stock fairings better, but they still match well enough and look great. I like the shorter length which was my main reason for buying them. They fit great, work smooth, and the adjusters on them work good as well. No complaints, good levers at a good price.
B007ED84XG|5|this sunshade adds so much cuteness to my car!
B002N5L9R8|5|Fits great. May need to make a longer cable in the future, Thanks.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|I bought this for a road trip and absolutely love it. I use it for it's intended purpose at the beach and as a little extra ground cover in my tent.
B007IODPZ8|5|Bought 2 of them for my 2011 gti, no issues.
B004GCDU32|5|Great deal. Couldn't have arrived any sooner
B007TYCXO6|5|awesome
B001Y8XRFC|5|Fit perfectly on a Silver '95 Subary Legacy. Makes it look a lot newer than before running with nothing. Great price as well. Easy instructions were  ingrained on each hub cap.
B00T5G53ZM|3|i bought  a blue coloured power 2 diagnostic scanner  which has a  bluetooth symbol  and the written statement says that it supports all OBD11 protocols to ELM327. it has 16 pins and is a blue transparent  moulded plastic. it fits on my 2002 Nissan ZD30 DDT under dash unit. I have downloaded OBD Torque on my Samsung 111 .After all this i cant get the torque to link with the ECU on the vehicle. Please note that the item i have in my posession looks like the one in your  FORSEAL. .Are these look-a -like all the same  product with different stamps and logos .Who is taking responsibility for these non functional items ?if there is a solution ie hardware /software i would welcome some input ,otherwise if this items can be made to work, i think that all motorist will appreciate them...
B00L2Q9JYY|5|Even nicer than it looks in the picture.
B00ZPMVKD4|5|These are great quality LED lights. I had ordered similar ones from an auction website, which were shipped from China, and they were extremely cheaply made and a few of them fell apart. These are solidly built, the connection wires are extra long and wrap all the way around the end of the lights. The actual electronic part of the light, which holds the LEDs, are secured within the base and do not move (much like the cheap ones did that I got). I have a Honda CR-V, which uses these T10 style lights. They are simple to install, and if they happen to not turn on when your try to power them on, just flip it around and it'll work. These lights have a &#34;Cool white&#34; look, which is a very bright pure white light. If you prefer a natural look, then you should look for a &#34;warm white&#34;, but honestly, I love seeing everything so pure and clean with a bright white light, though! These lights are super bright, as compared to factory installed bulbs. If you're looking to brighten up the inside of your car, these are the lights for you. I received this for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B004NJNKFG|1|hard to program and never could get north, east, west, to work
B00PT18QAQ|5|[[VIDEOID:3b839169fca0bed3a68b66d4f1894cd1]] Since our family is about to get an additional car, I was excited to get to try the TireTek Premium Tire Pressure Gauge.  The best thing about this tire gauge is, even though I am new to checking the tire pressure, I can use it myself with no help.  I like that I can feel confident that the right amount of air is in each tire and I am getting the maximum benefit and safety out of my vehicles tires.  I really like that the rubber protected gear makes it easy to find while stored and makes it easy to hang onto even when I have gloves on in the winter.  The swivel chuck comes in very handy when the tire valve is in an awkward position.  I like that the bleed valve just in case I over fill with air and get it back to the correct pressure.  I like that the numbers are easy to read even in bad weather.  I think this would make a great gift for anyone with a vehicle. I even used it on my kids bicycle tires!I recommend it!

B0017ODVTA|5|The best you can get on a sealed beam style.
B00VU8Y3Y0|5|Exact fit for my daughter' s 02 jeep liberty. She had a/c and everything fit. Plastic tanks on aluminum core.
B00FX40B16|5|This is a very nice, economically-priced wiper blade. It was easy to install and wipes the window clean with no streaks and no noise. After a month, they are still performing well. I also have a set of Bosch wipers on my other car, and after six months they too are performing like new. The real test will come after a year if they can survive a Midwestern winter with all our ice and snow. But for now, I'm very pleased.
B000Y832VC|2|Shipment was on time, and the fender was 8&#34; wide, however the inside radius was too all for a motorcycle tire.
B00FTABGTA|5|Works as intended, keeps liberals from tailgating. :)
B007AIQWVG|5|Arrived quickly. Side cover looks great
B00JBIXMLG|5|Headlights/corners/blinkers look awesome on my truck... best purchase I've made yet.  Gives it a ultra clean look, along with clear tails and a clear third brake light.  Shipping was very quick...  and overall was affordable, looks great, and will definitely do business with this seller again.
B000LOLWZW|5|Exactly what I needed.
B000CITK8S|4|As advertised.
B00FXLI8SC|5|Fit perfectly
B0069TND14|5|Good quality lights.
B000LY7JYK|4|Looks great on my 2013 GMC Sierra !!
B007KPT7G6|5|Fit perfectly
B004ZF4MO6|5|Extended review:<br /><br />I purchased these early in the year to replace an older kit on my wife's Toyota Venza. I purchased the kit in the 4300k temperature, as I wanted the closest to a factory HID color, and brightness for nighttime use. This kit fit the bill, and has lasted great so far. The box it comes in is a bit cheesy, but otherwise was packaged nicely, and all the components seemed of good build quality. Install time was approximately 30 minutes for me, no hand tools were necessary. After around 6 months of use, the bulbs are still nice and bright, with no flickering. Beam pattern is very nice (Venza also has projector housings).<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this kit to anyone looking for a nice 55w HID kit.
B00Q4O1HQC|5|Great leggings, awesome coverage of Kevlar for the price. Go to GoGo's website to find the sizing guidelines and use those — do not expect your US pant size to fit. I am a size 6 and ordered a 10 and they fit perfectly.
B003CQ1G02|3|Perfect
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Easy to store in my glove compartment fits perfect in my windshield so happy
B00QRHDIPY|5|good product
B000OUX9R2|5|Wish I had purchased prior to changing all my ignition coils. Will share this light set with friends and family.
B0042HJ93Q|4|Fast delivery exact fit, but i thought a little pricey for a small piece of plastic $49.49 ,but cheaper than a dealer. I have a 2005 Lincoln Aviator with 65000 miles and well kept since new, the old part broke like peanut brittle when I went to remove it.  I didn't need the little wiring pigtail that came on the new part so I just removed it. It was a little tough getting it in the head liner so I used a small plastic putty knife to move the headliner back around the new part, similar to putting a tire on the rim.  After installing, the overhead console snapped on just like new.  I thought about just gluing the console on but the old part was to brittle it would not last and may not be able to remove it later for some service reason, so I went with this new part, if you got to have it,  you got to have it !!  So if your cars worth fixing this is a good part to remount you overhead console. Half hour to forty five minutes to replace.
B004SEXO3E|5|thanks
B00ANNJ8A2|5|Exactly as advertised, work great, look awesome
B002OUMU66|5|Used to make my own power cord
B00MATVMC4|5|Love it
B00DKW73HS|5|excellent part for the price. And it fits many many different bikes.
B0031HT77Q|5|Installed easily and does the job.  No professional repair required due to acquiring this.
B00MG8KVJO|5|Love it worth the wait
B00NTU18KY|5|This is a great little device to test your various chargers and cables. With it you can easily find any cables that, due to small power wires, are limiting your devices charging speed. For example, one cable that came with some headphones could only charge at about 6 watts max, while some Anker cables got over 15 watts for charging the same device. It is a somewhat nerdy gadget, but is pretty cool to have.
B0034ZL3HW|3|Looks ok out of the box, but the finish quality was terrible, both inside and out.  I removed the roughness on the ID surface with my port and polish kit.  The outside was just as bad, the surface is &#34;as cast&#34; and cheaply painted.  I removed the rough surface and etched it with primer and coated it with high gloss lacquer paint then clear coated it.
B00032KC2G|5|Great screw for the vehicle plate. Its a anti - thief screw.
B00PQ4PO3S|5|Great product, but very slow shipping.  Still gets 5 stars because the amazing price.
B009S9RURU|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT ..EXCELLENT VENDOR
B00WW0LI66|3|While the lightbar is 52&#34; long, it is not curved. A little disappointed.
B00387A6TC|1|when i ordered this it was listed as a 2 pack.  also shows an image of TWO pads... it's only a one pack.. i bought two expecting to get 4...  now it's not listed as a two pack...
B002ONTBMO|5|Love it
B004NA7UY2|3|So I bought these this week and I put them on last night I cannot vouch for hoe good they work but I will tell you they line up weird the rear of the front window piece is cocked out at a 45 which looks kind of wierd. The design is odd not really a gap between the windshield and the rain guard so I do how much ventilation will be accessed with use but we will see.
B0018ETWJ2|5|Recently my wife and I road 250 miles in a steady rain on the inerstate. A little wet in the collar area but dry every where else. Well worth the price.
B003SYWZTE|1|I have a 2008 Pontiac G6 and bought this item which lasted only 2 days.  Turns out the harness connector melted again.  If your going to purchase this and know your terminals are melting, I would suggest the ceramic version.  It's a little more money, but at least you'll save time and shipping cost.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004IA3YQK/ref=mobile_oh_details_?ie=UTF8&psc=1#<br /><br />Cheers,

B00YME99WA|5|Fit and worked perfectly.
B004V92FKE|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B000GAN3GC|5|Good oil and price was right.
B000CSRA12|4|Installed on our 2011 Armada. It looks great and was super easy to install. No issues so far.
B00IH6W01Q|5|excellent
B003RAU00K|5|Dude, I bought two, what do you think.  If you own an Indian, it's a must have.
B000C57YAM|5|awesome
B000BQW5LK|5|Worked great for pumping gear oil into my transmission, transfer case and differential.  Really cut down on the mess from gravity feed using a longer hose and funnel, but that method usually requires two people.<br /><br />You might want a longer feed tube if you get a tall quart of gear oil, like mobil 1 75w-90.
B00JGJH8QU|5|It has caught a problem 2x since we have had it traveling to different campsite
B00CGTVCIC|5|Original 4-Star 8/20/2015 review:  Love this, but be aware that it makes your steering wheel feel much thicker.  For women or anyone with smaller hands, it feels odd.  Concerned I have slightly less control over my steering wheel.  However, I've had it a while now and feel like I am used to it.  Update 4/22/2017: I've been using this for years now, and still love it.  Got used to the thick size and it's not at all an issue.  Glad I purchased it.  Upgrading to 5 stars.
