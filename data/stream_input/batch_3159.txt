B009FRG8IW|1.0|The music does not play until the end. It gets cut off before the final chorus. I would like to get the entire track download.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I have not really tried it as for some reason I can not down load it on the Kindle fire HD I have . It is difficult to rate something which you don't have.<br />Amazon.Com should seriously look at their delivery system before they recommend something to their customers, particularly outside USA.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I love this CD. I bought it awhile ago and I still listen to it at least once a week. Amy Lee is an inspirational and phenomenal artist and I hope to see another album soon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My opinion is that the game is great for kids 4 and older.  Great for. The holiday to keep the kids out of the kitchen
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|This set gives you good value for the numbe parts versus the cost of the set.  The only negative I found is the door design is a little week.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|CAUTION THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH COMCAST WI-FI ARRIS TC862.  Google nor Comcast was not helpful. Neither one new anything about the product  DO NOT BUY!!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Not very impressed, the movie really does not give the story very well.  Story line jumps a great deal and simple does not explain what is going on.

B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Good story line and acting but I do think they made the story a little light and could have gone into much more detail about the people involved.

B00BEIYMTW|4.0|Before I begin my review I want to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together so it is important to do the following when using Amazon reviews of films: Take note as to whether the reviewer is reviewing the theater release (you can sort reviews by newest first) the DVD or the Bluray. That is always the best guide. With that said, here is my review of the BLURAY.<br /><br />PLANES is – for all intents and purposes – an aerial version of the two CARS films. In fact there is a preview of the Planes sequel (direct to DVD) on this set. PLANES was probably aimed at the Direct-to-DVD market originally but they added 3-D and were able to market it to those theaters as well.<br /><br />As to the  91-minute film itself, there are enough reviews here to guide you (as for me, it was basically the same old story about finding you future success). I’ll discuss the BD and bonuses.<br /><br />First the BD looks great! Wonderful images and sound.<br /><br />The bonuses include:<br />A deleted song (with live introduction by the Director Klay Hall and one of the films producers. This last 3:18.<br />TWO deleted scenes shown as storyboards – introductions by the two above (8 minutes)<br />“Meet the Flyers”  - introduces the “characters” (1:17)<br />“Top Ten Flyers” – a 5-minute piece – done as a “sports show” acknowledging those such as Howard Hughes, Jimmy Doolittle and (honorably) the Tuskegee Airmen.<br />“Klay’s Flight Plan” a 15 minute piece showing the direct taking his 2 teenage sons to see famous antique planes and taking rides in them. After watching this, you’ll know exactly why John Rassiter chose Hall to direct this film.<br />While, it’s primarily a kids film there are a lot of jokes that only the adults may get ( I love the “Flying for Dummies” book, for instance.)<br /><br />So it’s not a masterpiece but worth an hour or so to spend with your kids. Hey, maybe theill want to visit your local airport after seeing this.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”it your local airport after seeing this.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”
B0006AAS5G|1.0|I purchased the Speedway watch in May 2013 after reading over the positive and negative reviews. I figured I'd take a chance, but just in case, I purchased the extended warranty offered through Canopy.<br /><br />The watch itself seemed just fine at first, and contrary to other reviews, the top and bottom buttons do operate the chronograph feature (at least mine did) but overall, I feel it is a touch over priced after looking it over, and comparing to Citizen or Relic after the fact. Some buyers complained about the bracelet being real flimsy. I did not find that to be the case on mine, however the clasp was a bit flimsy.<br /><br />When day light savings time came in November 2013, I went to reset the time the next morning, and the adjustment screw for the time came completely out, so no adjustment can be performed. I recall reading about this in one of the negative reviews on Amazon as well. The factory warranty is completely useless, and I am very pleased that I purchased the extended warranty through Canopy offered by Amazon. Canopy just credited me the cost of the watch with an Amazon gift card. I will most likely not be purchasing another Invicta watch.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the quality of this watch, and had higher hopes for it.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Stupid. No story.  Just violence and destruction.  Hated it. I cannot believe people pay to see this stuff.  Waste of time.
B002LC2DQ4|1.0|This did not work with my older Olympus camera.  I could not get help from Olympus.  My next digital camera will not be an Olympus, because they should support their electronics as long as the electronics work, in my opinion.
006202406X|1.0|So, so, so disappointed with this one after LOVING the first two books.  The change in perspective from Tris to Four is just confusing and words cannot describe how upset I was with the ending.  This was not a great literary work that needed the unexpected, this is a fictional series for young adults and grownups like me who like an interesting but not overly challenging read.  I really feel betrayed by the author...she led us down one path and finished in the opposite direction.  I want a re-do!
0312427999|5.0|A brilliant synthesis of many of the evils in the modern world. Written with passion but with attention go<br />details, so that her opponents will find it hard to tear holes in the argument.
B004GBIE3Y|1.0|This was awful I hated the cast, plot, and acting. Main guy wasn't relatable and was just whiny. It wasn't a funny story, I didn't laugh. I covered my eyes so I didn't have to watch the more awkward moments.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Another great Baldacci book. I never seem to get enough of a Balacci fix. The books a page turner that ends way to quickly I read it in six hours.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As with all Malcom Gladwell books it gives you a step back to look at the world with a little different point of view. I didn't agree with every word but still give it five stars. If you have ever felt like the underdog or that life just isn't fair, you need to read this book.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|(spoilers included)  I have always been an avid fan of the Superman movies except for this one. There was too much change when compared to the original story and I might have considered it more worthy if they just created a totally new superhero. Maybe Alien man since Krypton and their ships reminded you of something you'd see on the movie &#34;Alien.&#34;  Also it was entirely TOO LONG.  The fight scenes were one big blur and you rarely knew where they were actually fighting. The &#34;Finding Myself&#34; time of Superman was also TOO LONG. There was all of this focus on the inner Superman and all it did was make one feel like you knew him less and there was this vibe of his depression etc. Superman is suppose to be about action, love and heart. Not Superman's inner state. Especially since the character hasn't been fully developed yet. People cared about Christopher Reeves rendition bc it was a slow build like a peeling effect. First starts off awkward, wants to show off, angry for not doing more, exploratory and traveler, back to geek, funny and comical at times, to hero savior, to man in love, to man being depressed bc he can't be w Lois. It took awhile bf the depressed state came and all of his insecurities were brought to the forefront.  And that's what's missing from most of the new Superman movies.  Also Krypton originally was an ice planet. Not a desert land. It also had no dinosaurs on the planet.  Hated that he allowed his dad to die in tornado. He cud have blurred his way through the debris and saved him like on Smallville.  Didn't understand why they didn't just have Jonathan to die of a heart attack like before. That's more realistic that he Wudnt be able to save him. Not the tornado part.  The major major big turn off of the film is that nearly everyone knows or could easily find out who he is since his classmates and the town saw him save them from drowning in a river.  Lois was even able to track him down to the Kent farm to find out about his spaceship. This isn't how they first met. And plus it takes away from the build up effect.  Also at the end of the movie he decides to go incognito wearing his eyeglasses and supposedly Lois doesn't know who he is even though he has the same last name as Superman which is Kent. She tracked him down. And he didn't kiss her to make her forget. Overall this was a bizarre film.  The only parts I liked was the explaining Zod's side or reason for him becoming a moron. Also liked the film telling what happened after Clark left his mother and went traveling along the way to meet his shadow father who should have taught him for 12 years if you go by Christopher Reeves rendition. That's why on the old Superman he comes back in his thirties.
B000FC146C|5.0|Read Thorn Birds together with my mom years and years ago. This is my second read with this book after about 30 years. It's amazing how your perspective changes over that many years.

0060574216|5.0|This is a well written book. Everything makes so much sense in the world because of this book. I'm definitely going to recommend this book to my clients in individual and couples therapy. If all couples read this book before they got married there probably would be less divorce in the world.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is wonderful! It has amazing graphics and is fun to play! You should really get this fun game!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|best author of our time and can't wait to purchase the other two in the trilogy. Fall of giants is a must read
B0001I55OC|4.0|I agree with most of the reviewers that the Michael Crichton book was far better than the film that is based on it. I also got the impression that the film-makers did a rush job, did not develop the characters’ personalities, and stressed action rather than the story. Nevertheless, the film is worth seeing. There is a lot of drama. About a half dozen people risk their lives to go back in time into an area where a war is being waged and a castle will be destroyed. But they go back to 1357 to rescue a professor who made the trip before them and needs to be rescued. Many things go wrong both in the twentieth century and the fourteenth.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Good story line but writing quality is only ok.  Interesting ethical issues to think about and discuss. Brings the reader into a world few  know about.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|The critics hate when people do their own thing. With a powerful voice, great imagination, and instrumental skills she lays out an interesting and insightful look into her self being. The songs are catchy and different from each other and offers something for everyone except for the people  still clinging to the commercialized Madonna era. Gaga delivers the goods.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is a really cool game. My talking Tom is already preschooler size. You can even pick a different name for it. I recommend you get this awesome game.

1596432594|5.0|I don't read many graphic novels, but this one piqued my interest because of the lively subject matter. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman was a real character and this covers many aspects of his variegated life. After reading this, I went back and read his &#34;Why do you care what other people think&#34;.

B001684L0A|5.0|If you like historical fiction watch this mini-series. It is riveting and the wonderful. I will watch it again one day!
0020252706|5.0|What's to say?  It's a horror classic from Mary Shelley.  Demented doctor wants to play God and thinks go out of control.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I just love being able to watch the original, unaltered 1977 theatrical release of the film.  Although I would've loved it a LOT more if the film had been fully remastered and its original quality restored.  I also would've loved at least some basic Extras included on one or more of the discs as well.<br /><br />But, all-in-all, it's the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, so what's not to love about that?
140006922X|1.0|Very disappointed.  I expected a scholarly trip through ancient Palestine which was based on as much reality as we can expect after 3,000 years.  But I got a lot of quotations from the Bible as though this writer didn't realize the misunderstandings of multiple translations in multiple languages and mutating through time.  I gave up on it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really really good book. I recommend it 100%. It makes your heart rush and when u find out what happens u want to keep reading more. At the end of this book u really want to continue reading but there isn't any more so u are wanting to get the next book (Mocking Jay) and in the middle of that download you are so anxious u can hardly help it. I haven't seen the movie yet but I'm really excited to see what they came up with to put in the movie. What um trying to say is read this book you won't regret it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Interesting story, easy to read, well written.Comprehensive.Good characters.  A little bit &#34;thrown together&#34; and simplistic, in  terms of all the characters and places included.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It took me over 23 hours of reading to finish this book,  but I enjoyed every second of it. For the days that I was reading it, I'd find myself drifting off thinking about Theo, as if he were a relative with a problem I wish I could find a solution for. There's a lot of philosophy on life and art, so if that's not your thing you might find it long winded but I thought it was appropriately slotted into the story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. It's so awesome!!!! If you ask my 8 year old sis, she'll say it ROCKS!!!!!!!!!! Yes yes.....you know it ROCKS 2!!!! Good luck on the game!!!!!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't think these books were meant for someone of my generation. While I love books about what someone sees as the future, this series took too much time developing and coming to a close. This felt like a two hour movie with a stretched out one hour plot. As a result, the 3 star rating.
B0078Q2HAA|3.0|THE IRON LADY boasts a wonderful central performance by Meryl Streep as Baroness Thatcher; she is wholly convincing at capturing the politician's peculiar vocal inflections.  The most interesting aspect of Phyllida Lloyd's film is the way it portrays Mrs. Thatcher as driven by hubris - despite her humble origins, she remained convinced of the rightness of her cause, even when she was manifestly wrong.  This was especially the case in 1990, when she was forced to resign as leader of the Conservative Party over her support for the Poll Tax.  The film shows how she rode roughshod over any objections raised by her Cabinet, even when they were probably right to object.  With this knowledge in mind, we do not feel much sympathy for her when she is shown as a lonely elderly lady, without the support of her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent), and trying and failing to fend for herself.  The supporting performances in this film are colorless, sometimes veering towards the grotesque (Richard E. Grant's Michael Heseltine is particularly guilty in this respect).  But the film belongs to Streep and her towering central characterization.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was very well written and it kept me reading to see what would happen.When I figured out what would happen I read faster.  This book is recommended for anyone who likes real life situations that make you stop and think. I would recommend the book.
1619690039|4.0|I enjoyed this audiobook- a little slow moving and somewhat predictable but the story line and characters were engaging. It was perfect for a long car trip.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|This season was unlike any other Dexter season in that we all knew it would end. Somehow, someway, Dexter would find himself at the end of the journey we have so loved to follow all these years. Now I will preface what I'm about to say with this: I thoroughly enjoyed most of the episodes of this final season, in an of themselves. The writing was great, the pacing brilliant, always tense. Classic Dexter and yet a touch of something more refined. But now the reason for the ONE star rating-the ending. If you haven't heard by now it is bad, to be gentle. To be honest it ruins the entire series for me. I regret getting so involved and committed to the story. I feel like it would have been better to not watch this season and end my Dexter adventure with the previous.<br />So be warned and beware. This final season of Dexter will break your heart, but not in a satisfying way.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Have it since one week and I love it. Nice format, small and light, to put into your pocket. The screen is very good and useful,  I check several time a day where I stand. It motivates me to move. Really great and I recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Great series overall, although there was too much sex in the series it's definitely well written. I'm sure I'll be reading them a second time as I wait in anticipation of the film version.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is the second time i read it, and i love it there is a thing or two that i will change but overall i really like this trilogy. I cant wait for the last movie to come out.
B00EKHE1JA|2.0|After opening I held it up by its chest to look at it and the weight of its lower body ripped it in half, after gluing it back together I tried to get it to stand up and look nice on my shelf. After 2-3 falls the leg popped off and won't go back on. Looks cool, but don't buy it without a base, because he doesn't stand up on his own AT ALL.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My oppinion on hungry shark is that this game is outstanfing.I think this because there are great grafics and it is a amazingly gun game of having a life of a shark and finding cloaks.I showed this game to all my friends and they agree that it is a gun game.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I will give it 5 stars when I'm able to use more apps with it. Other than that, works as expected.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Great simple masterpiece of a movie with great music...and it was shot for around USD$160,000! Watch it, you'll like it.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|A wonderful, well written story.  Watched the film after reading it and was disappointed.  Capote was on the money wanting Marlyn Monroe to play Holly.
B000LJAEFG|5.0|Christopher Walken before he was &#34;Christopher Walken.&#34;  Great science fiction, spiritual, metaphysical story line.  No CGI here - thank God.
B001TW68P4|3.0|This is great for those few songs we all love, but I can't say much for the whole thing.  I guess that's why the Turtles were never huge.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Really good movie! Great HD quality, i recommend to everyone who is a fan of Bond movies! You should watch it!
B00G32TD98|2.0|Even tho was supposed to be based on a true story, just didn't find it too heart-thumping scary.  Wouldn't run out to rent it.  Wait til it's cable for free.
0486282112|5.0|Very good book. For those of you who have not read Mary Shelleys Frankenstein, and think you know the story of Frankenstein, you are wrong. This book is depressing but spectacular. Well written, eloquent, tension building and a page turner but not as much as a horror story as you may expect. It has almost nothing in common with the movie Mary Shelleys Frankenstein as the movie has been changed greatly. Read this and I doubt you will be disappointed .
B00C2UUPQA|5.0|I really enjoyed this human tale of the men engaged in battle and subsequent escape from a POW camp.<br />The sheer tenacity.  The hope.  The survival!<br />The escape, recapture.  The escape and freedom.  The recapture<br />Then the escape and the inevitable.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Fun game, but instructions per level are a bit on the sparse side.  Hate the way they want you to go to Facebook.  The biggest DISLIKE about the game is how they time you out and won't let you in until their specified time elapses (which constantly changes) or you get help from Facebook friends (which I refuse to do).  Ditch the Facebook EXTREME connection and I would add another star.  Stop timing out and holding the game hostage, I'd boost it yet another star.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love storing my notes in this app it's so nice to be able to sync with my phone and kindle.  I only have it 4 stars because I wish you could puffy a password on it. I don't think your able to.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I read this book because the awesome author Hugh Howey mentioned that it was good and I'm totally in love with his books! It also had really good reviews, too! When I read the story summary of Ready Player One, I have to say I thought it sounded pretty weird and not something I would normally read or even like. But I also thought that about the Hunger Games (which I loved). So I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did!! I loved this book and would recommend it to everyone, especially anyone who grew up in or loves the 80's.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|The mechanic is very fun. The aesthetic is nice to look at and the music is good. Like the upgrades and variety in stages and enemies. My only complaint is that, for the stages that last very long, there is not enough happening to keep me interested and it becomes repetitive. Other than that, the game is fun and very original from other games I have played.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great!!! I was reluctant to read this due to its nature, but I'm glad I did. Looking forward to the next book.
B0081ISUOG|3.0|This app is great for timing and the countdown. I am able to keep a log of better times and such. I don't like having an app that has to have amazon connected to it, if you uninstall for any reason for that matter. That's why I have given it 3 stars.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This is a great game. It is hours and hours of fun. I am glad to have such a cool game to play on my Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just saw the moving.  What can one person do to change the world.  What is the cost of just trying to survive?
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Ok game. If you have a small screen,  you will have a hard time seeing the difference in the puzzles.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|a classic.  A series where no one lives happily even after.  A society so wrong.  Killing is sport, Starvation in used to rule.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|really great drama and great acting by all.  Good group of characters from the town with all of their mannerism makes things interesting.
B00E193Y36|5.0|I'm loving this album sooooo much!!!!<br />The new songs are perfect. This is definitely my favorite band. The live songs sound amazing too. Definitely looking forward to buy the volume 2.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|This was okay…I keep thinking people need to be honest from the beginning. But then again we would never have movies.
B00FLDG52I|4.0|If you like Guitar music you should love this DVD.  I really like the blues and was hoping that that would be the main feature of this DVD  However, there is a wider variety of music on Crossroads 2013 than in previous years.  If you are looking for Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy Etc. Blues music there is plenty of it but, there is also several sessions of other types of music such as Jazz and Folk plus there seems to be more acoustic music in this program than in previous shows.<br /><br />If you have liked the previous Crossroads Performances then you should enjoy this one too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for killing time, however it does become quite addicting. Great for kids because the theme and missions do change with the seasons.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game. It keeps my attention with all the different tasks. It can be very addictive. I just wish there was a way to get a dragon without having to pay so many crowns.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|No formula here.  Old familiar characters and an interesting premise albeit predictable.  Once again a page turner,  I read it in two days.
1401938906|5.0|Love the book! It's do full of wisdom and relevant experiments. The shipper was very professional and I got the book right away.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|The next (final?) installment in the Tiffany Aching series, this one doesn't disappoint. It's another can't-put-down read, a great ending to Tiffany's story arc, though I hope to see her many more times in Sir Terry's works. And of course, the Feegles play their part!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|It good but some times if you play games or do anything it take you out of the app you were on to show you the percentage fairly it is quite annoying so I got the android version for battery ;) this is great take no offense try if you want but I am not a big fan of this either way it's OKAY go for it! :) 0_ 0
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Well, I can truly say that was the best book I have read in awhile.<br /> I have been reading obsessed lately . Reading anything I can get my hands on.<br />This has been truly refreshing and funny,with a few dashes of sexy and hot thrown in for good measure.<br />The main characters point of view dialogue  and inner monologue is right on and keeps your interest to the end. I really liked the back and forth banter, quite funny and sexy.<br />I can't wait for her next book.

Better yet, it was intermingled with belly laughs at the ludicrous big pharma industry, the contradiction of familial love, and downtrodden physicians trying to keep their chins (and their peeps) up.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|too &#34;dark&#34;, storyline hard to follow, didn't always understand what was going on. Didn't find the characters, especially the main character, very appealing. the movie didn't live up to my expectations, a little less realism and a little more &#34;hollywood&#34; might have made it more entertaining. too much &#34;grit&#34; for me

B00006AW2G|5.0|This album will help you to remember* the sixties whether you were there or not. The play list includes: Midnight Rambler and You Can't Always Get What You Want, two of my favorites. All of the tracks are memorable.  This is great Stones, if not the best. It is well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />*The saying goes, \\"If you can remember the sixties, then you weren't there.\\" This is a self-referential quote. No one remembers who said it first.

He absolutely loves it too!

0062107313|4.0|Amy Tan's latest novel is set during the first half of the 20th century in China. A period of time that saw the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the founding of the Republic of China, and changing relationships with foreigners in China.<br /><br />This novel revolves around 2 characters, an American mother (Lulu) and daughter (Violet, who is 7 at the outset of the novel).  Lulu runs a high class courtesan house, Hidden Jade Path that unusually caters to both Chinese and Western clients. Lulu enhances her clients experience by being a business matchmaker, putting together those with a mutual business need, and then she receives payment in appreciation.  Violet, her spoiled daughter who is half Chinese, has been raised in Hidden Jade Path.<br /><br />Violet's voice narrates much of the story, and provides insight into the workings of the house of courtesans. Violet struggles with her mixed heritage, especially since they her father has abandoned them.  Often denying her Chinese half when it is viewed as lesser, and Western as superior.<br /><br />The story begins in late Qing dynasty.  We then move 5 years forward to 1912 and the founding of the republic.  Marking the end of the 100 years of humiliation, anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise, even in the protected confines of Shanghai.  Lulu leaves Shanghai (as did many Westerners) at  this turbulent time to go back to California and to find her lost son. Her some-time lover Fairweather tricks her into letting him take Violet to the American Embassy for a passport.  Instead Fairweather sells her to another house of courtesans and sends the message to Lulu who is boarding the boat back to the US that she was killed in an accident.<br /><br />The story then switches to following Violet for the next decade and a half as she is trained in the arts of a courtesan, and as if by fate, enters her mother's profession.  Violet's mentor is Magic Gourd, formerly of her mother's house and then was expelled after rumors that she saw the ghost of the poet who had lived in the house years earlier.  Magic Gourd is the attentive mother that Violet lost, and in some senses, never had.<br /><br />Violets life as a courtesan is nothing, if not eventful, filled with lovers, 2 marriages, a child, banishment to the hinterlands, escape.  Under Magic Gourd's tutelage, she grows up into a mature woman, but it is a rough journey.<br /><br />Then towards the end, the novel flashes back to Lulu's adolescence and early adulthood, and we see what brought her to Shanghai.<br /><br />As always, Amy Tan's novel is filled with complex women, with the men, save for a few exceptions, fading to the background.  Violet and Lulu's emotional development fuels the storyline.  In this book everyone has contorted relationships with their parents, and for all their talking, we can see that without true communication, these relationships are filled with missed opportunities, missed connections, and just plain missteps.the ghost of the poet who had lived in the house years earlier.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing you can play it for a long time and never get bored and it is so cute!!!
B0081ISUOG|5.0|It was amazing I had no trouble at all with it . I have another timer app and this one works so much better.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very well constructed and thought out book about a fictional used account of a real event.  I applaud the author for the research done and the development of characters.  Ending was a little too perfect, but did not ruin the story at all.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Liane Moriarty really can tell a tale.  You have sympathy for the characters and yet despise some of their decisions.  It is extraordinary to find an author who can walk this delicate tightrope.  This would be a great choice for book clubs -- lots of issues to discuss, but still an easy and enjoyable read.
B00FQAZ7PW|3.0|Some songs in this album feel very much like classic Pearl Jam but for the most part it's songs that would need to grow on me as they didn't instantly ring as &#34;love&#34; songs.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My lives that friends sent keep disappearing. They built up for when I really wanted a session. But then one day they were all gone. Love the game but this not fair and frustrating. ,
B0055S348W|1.0|Doesn't work with my 2 printers. Generic drivers won't work on one and the other isn't listed and has no generic driver. Can't get refund due to it Amazon Return Policy on apps. Guess I'll eat the cost!
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Joe,<br /><br />Just got this one and I'm still rockin with ya. I love your raw approach to soulful heartfelt music. Truthfulness wins everytime. Go all out!!!!!!!!!!! Never stop thinking of the ladies and how they feel when things go wrong and you'll win everytime. A fan for life.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|This book is the real deal. Great insights and great examples from some of my favorite Ted talks. Highly recommended for anyone looking to improve communication skills
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|This game is like other word tile games, but much better.  It is much more challenging, has a better interface, and very enjoyable.  It will challenge you from the beginning!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Much better than the movie! While the characters are all broken people, they are moving and intensely human. Their quest to heal their lives and be kind to others is compelling.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I found this novel to be engrossing, unique, disturbing, creative..  I didn't want to see the movie, it looked too weird.  But a friend recommended the book, and I was amazed by the clever structure, the way the author captured different writing styles for different historical and future periods, and by the ingenious interweaving of all of the stories.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Loved it couldn't stop playing finished the whole map! Ready for odd ball 2!!! I give this game 5 stars bring it on!
159463176X|5.0|It has been a long six year wait for a third novel from Khaled Hosseini best selling author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. As a great fan of his first two novels I have been looking forward to his next novel for a long time, I can honestly say that And The Mountains Echoed was well worth the wait. An outstanding storyteller he has written another very moving and emotional tale, this time about how the choices we make in life can reverberate through time shaping our futures in surprising ways. The story does not just cross generations but also continents Kabul, Paris, San Franciso and a Greek Island.<br /><br />Spanning sixty years with a vast cast of characters, the story hinges entirely on Abdullah and his sister Pari and how a heart breaking event in their childhood, will stay with them and mould their lives for years to come. The scenarios and characters are very realistic as the novel transports us from rural Afghanistan to its busy cities and beyond to the wider world as it slips backward and forward in time. Always linking in subtle ways to the story that a loving father was relating to his children at the opening of the novel.<br /><br />A story and characters that will stay with you long after you finish the last page, a must read for all fans. If you are not yet one, it is time you read a novel from an author that really understands about life in Afghanistan. Highly recommended.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Never could install it on my phone, got my money back

0812550706|5.0|This book is a really good Sci-Fi book that never lets you put it down once you start reading the very first page. I always enjoy reading a book before seeing the movie, you always get more from the book. It let's your imagination form in your mind what the scenes, and characters look like!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|So I was cruising for some good racing games on kindle, and I saw this. Wonderful game! Not only does it have Fords and Lamborghinis, it's also got Renaults, Citroens, and even an Opel! Thank u God!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This touched my heart and reminded me why we must appreciate those people and moments in our lives that really matter and then we must hold on tight because everything will eventually fade.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|This game was really not very fun. I don't know what is wrong it may be me or something with this game. I have been checking on it every few days to see if it will work but it does nothing.  It seems that I am supposed to harvest apples by tapping on apple trees but tapping on the trees gives a little symbol of the trees being watered but there are never any apples to harvest.  I do not recommend this game.  The only reason that I tried it is that Zynga had sent an email promising some extra bonus if I started playing it and I don't think that the bonus ever got added either not that it would have made this game playable.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|We are constantly bombarded by the media with true stories of murder and torture, and twisted minds of people who do terrible things to other people.  That's in part what makes this movie so foreboding and dark.  Okay, so the truth behind the murders in this movie is a bit farfetched, but it's a MOVIE.  So was Frankenstein, the Wolfman, etc. but that didn't keep people from being creeped out by the sheer thought of the possibility of something like that happening.  Any situation where innocence is turned into something sinister (no pun intended) is always disturbing, and that's what makes this movie engaging.  I think it was well done and qualifies as a good, solid &#34;scary movie&#34; if that's what you're looking for.  It's amusing when reviewers tell everyone how mediocre a movie is because the ending was predictable.  Well, if you sit there and think about it as though you were Sherlock Holmes instead of letting yourself be entertained, you can figure out any number of endings to any movie.  There's no challenge in that, so nobody is really impressed by their self-proclaimed acumen.  Apparently some people don't know how to sit back and let themselves be entertained through that wonderful little mind trick called suspension of disbelief.  That being the case, they should become movie critics and get paid for what they do rather than doing it for free and trying to turn other people off to something that is potentially enjoyable.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|brilliantly written because he kept weaving reminders of what had happened in the first 2 books and it was a good twist at the end. can´t wait for the 4th book....
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Amazing cast and writing. One of my favorite series ever. It's a little gritty, but tells a great story. Fascinating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so colorful and addictive. Absolutely love it, the variety of different levels is fun and cute  addictive:)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this every night for my now two month old and I have become quite attached to the sounds as well. We are driving across the country and having a familiar noise during hotel stays has been great as well. There are so many sounds and I love that you can make up a combination of any sounds you like. I tried several white noise apps and this is by far the best one.
B000001FDK|5.0|3 words:  Sna Na Na.  Their music brings it all together.<br /><br />I took my girlfriend to see this new in the cinema back in '78.  What a different world back then!  Travolta was still in the closet, the Democrat in the White House was not an OVERT communist, kids weren't all mysteriously allergic to peanut butter (and weren't all on ADHD drugs yet), and tattoos were for veterans of the maritime services.  The hottest chick in the show was a dancer, a girl whose name I never determined.  And...never will, it seems.<br />Great drive-in movie, if you can catch it somewhere.....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|wonderfully and very usefully calculated for kindle. it's easy and User friendly for any gender. download it and enjoy it.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|There was No story line. Got real boring after awhile.  Had to page forward to the end to survive this book!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoy the adventures on this version of the game. It works well on my kindle glad they came up with this version.
1250038820|5.0|Fantastic book that you gives a deeper look into one of the most fascinating cities on the planet. Brandon's keen eye to visually interesting human beings and even more adept ear to hearing the stories that need to be told about the humans we encounter on a daily basis is amazing. A perfect conversation starter and the perfect gift for the next person on your list.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed!
160774273X|5.0|A Fascinating book on how Ken developed his methods of bread baking as well as about his bakery.  It has lots of wonderful recipes as well.  I bought this for my husband who is the baker!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a great product but due to limitations with the kindle fire and the limited apps that are available, only a 3 star.  If it were more versatile I'd give it a 4 1/2.  For starters, there is not a Chromecast app in the Amazon store so I had to download a side app.  There is probably a bit of headbutting between Google and Amazon since as far as I can tell there is no way to view your Amazon content using this device.  (Google Chrome Browser may remedy this but then again another side app and I'm not familiar with it).  So I can see why Amazon wouldn't give them an app in their store.  The only apps I know you can use with the device are Hulu+, Netflix, Youtube, and 3 or 4 google apps.<br /><br />On the plus side, if you use the above mentioned apps it works great.  (I only do Netflix out of these)  Set up was a piece of cake once I had theChromecast side app installed.  There was no lag and the picture actually seemed better on my tv than when I was plugged in via an hdmi cable with my Kindle Fire.  To start viewing, you actually use your Netflix app and hit a button in the upper right of the screen that enables the Chromecast viewing.  Whatever you start playing immediately goes to full screen on your tv and you are able to do other things on your tablet without affecting the playback.<br /><br />I'm an Amazon guy so I'm a little annoyed these guys can't play nice but if you primarily use the available apps this is a good investment.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A quick read for a busy Mom, only because it kept me interested! A story that makes you think and be grateful for what you truly have, whether you realize it or not.....
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie....hope they don't screw it up! I loved the ending. It really sticks with you.
B000L212HC|5.0|Great movie that's about all I can say it simply amazing, the twist and turns the whole ride was just epic if your a fan of inception or shutter island it has a similar feel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read so far.  It's a mixture of violence and love that makes the story complete. When you start reading this book, be careful, because you won't be able to stop reading it.
1586210661|5.0|I bought this as a gift. I read the book and it is laugh out loud hilarious! I highly recommend it!
0307271080|4.0|I really like reading this book. I bought it after reading half of a yellow sun which i absolutely loved. As a Nigerian, it feels so great reading a book i can totally relate to..I really did not like Ifemelu. I thought she was selfish...but all in all, it was a really good book.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Hey Its Sunnydale Chick here.....I just thought I'd write an early X-mas review about one of my FAVORITE movies from when I was a kid and on. I saw this originally AFTER Lost Boys, and I ALWAYS remembered that because Most people would think 1st because it's a kids movie.....but something funny--is if you know your movies, there's an order to these even though they're all support----- When these 1st came out it goes lime this.....Ghoulies, Critters and Gremlins....and they're all pretty similar (this counts from when they turn from cute little Mogwai 2 Gremlins.....and become little monsters (Hey I like em' and have wanted a Mogwai since I was a kid......but NOT just one like GIZMO......one like Stripe 2(who's like the baddest of all the villainous creatures....and yep this was when I was a kid.......but by this time I'd also scene Lost Boys and a WHOLE lot of Scary Movies.......which brings me 2 a funny point that I know everyone knows....lots and lots and LOTS of people watches this for X mas (although I just kinda watch it when I want now.....but that's cause I like 2 stretch out my favorite holidays) But this one fits better for Halloween (in a nightmare before xmas kinda way) Which brings me 2 another point.....Stripe I love you, even when you're playing that arcade game, but You should let GIZMO play his gold trumpet! Mean! Definitely NO Food after midnight now......although I would let them take down that mean old lady! I don't like her anymore now then when I was a kid! But I love when the  Gremlins are singing (even though Its VERY off key (but EXTREMELY funny) Let's see, there's Gremlins Xmas.....Love the song Intro by the way) I know there's something I'm forgetting.....Oh yeah! Corey Feldman' s in this 2! Here's something interesting though if you've seen the McDonald's Xmas Commercial he was in when he was 6; I bet you'd think I saw this then ( when ACTUALLY I only saw it a few months ago on Utube.....why? Nobody knows I mean for a girl who's seen all his movies since I was 8, you'd think I would've......but I missed it, I saw it when I was watching an Interview he did for Lost Boys The Tribe and where he would've been about 10 in Gremlins....he's only 6 here it's so VERY fun! Again WHY do I know so much? No I'm NOT like Kathy Bates in Misery.......I'm just me....a cool outcast....and soon you'll know all of the story!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun had by every individual who plays! Love playing this game with my son. Needs more bear and elk hunts.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|Michael Connelly never fails to deliver...to make a lawyer into a hero you root for is quite an achievement. I also love how his characters/storylines all interconnect...their history matters, and this serves to make the characters and their stories all the more convincing.<br /><br />This latest episode of the MIcky Haller storyline is a masterpiece of the genre.  I ate up the pages towards a very satisfying end, and can't wait for the next installment.  The only problem is that I also want the next Harry Bosch story.<br /><br />Connelly does not rely on just one hero, one series of books....he has two on the go, and is clever enough to connect them as fictional half brothers.  Bring on the next book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game. 5 stars. Love to play. Great pass time. Earn money to play slots . Have gotten slot of people hooked on this.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|This is a 'must have' for every Queen fan.  The Blu-Ray effect, it really does make a difference, everything is so sharp and crystal clear, feel like you are part of the concert.  I still cannot get over it.  Freddie is no longer with us but this is how I want to remember him.  He is the greatest.  Freddie, John, Brian and Roger - this is their incredible performance.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|Dr. Seuss is a hell of a writer, the message is something all kids should be raised with. This is my second copy of the movie to replace the first one that was worn out.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great app. My only complaint is there is not the crowd cheering when I win, my old game cheered. It is funny but the cheering makes winning more fun.

B005LQ6UE8|4.0|I am going crazy.  How do I cancel this book.  Since i read the reviews and found it was fiction, not a true story, I have no desire to read it again.  I liked it very much the first time I read it, when it was billed as a true story,<br /><br />For heavens sake, cancel it.  I couldn't figure out how.  Marjorie
0143124544|5.0|I adored this book, although the last few chapters were heartbreaking. I think you'd like this book if you enjoyed One Day. This book makes you appreciate what you have, that's for sure!

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Fun to play, but crowns are very expensive!!!  The only way to get a dragon is with 750 crowns.  Probably won't continue to play because of this.
B00FEN000S|3.0|I expected a lot of destruction, a lot of meaningless conflict and a lot of noise.  I was not disappointed.  What I was not expecting was to see that this movie was a sixty percent copycat of Independence Day II, up to and including some stolen phrases.  Yes important details were changed; the movie essentially occurs in Hong Kong, the aliens come from the sea, and we do not disable the mother ship with a virus. But so much more of this movie could have, with just a few twists and pulls here and there, been the oriental copycat of scenes from that 1998 movie.  That includes a harrowing last-second escape from the alien side of the breach and a fleet of craft coming to escort the two heroes to glory.  The aliens were very much like their IDII cousins--or at least their habits were.  They went from world to world, exterminating and terrraforming the planet for their occupation until they had exhausted its resources, and then they moved on to the next. Sound familiar?<br /><br />The character development was stagnant, the dialog was okay, and the plotline believable, if you know how to suspend disbelief, but I found some things to be just too hard to swallow.  The movie has a fifteen year history to its plot (that is, the aliens started showing up fifteen years ago) and each alien attack brings terrible devastation to the target of its attack.  Why does the world seem pretty much the same, then, when the movie finally really gets started?  If the world endured fifteen years of increasing devastation then by the time this story starts, it would no longer be living in the prosperous 21st century, but in the impoverished, outlaw-driven stone age, with only a few enclaves of civilization still around, attempting to fight the good fight.<br /><br />And finally, for those of you who are looking for a family-friendly show to watch, this ain't it.  The cursing is, if not profligate, certainly more than I would want my kids to hear if I had any.  In fact the very last scene shown in the middle of the credits is particularly funny, but starts out with a pretty vicious use of vulgarity which added little to the scene and just made me want to turn the show off.<br /><br />So if I have all of this bad stuff to say why did I give the movie three stars?  Because I like a good monster flick.  And though I would have preferred more originality, I still laughed at the right spots and I still jerked up in surprise at the right spots.  Mr. del Toro may have hired some poor writers for the storyline, but it contained enough of the right stuff that I sat through the whole thing and well into the credits.<br /><br />If you are not looking for high quality, and if you enjoy the bash-em-up  kind of flick that seems so popular on the screen these days, then you will probably be entertained by this movie. But do not expect any moments of epiphany from it; the story, besides being a copycat, this film is skin deep.wn in the middle of the credits is particularly funny, but starts out with a pretty vicious use of vulgarity which added little to the scene and just made me want to turn the show off.<br /><br />So if I have all of this bad stuff to say why did I give the movie three stars?

1932100660|5.0|I have been vegetarian for a long time but always included dairy and eggs. I've had this book for awhile and wasn't really interested in tackling the scientific data I could see as I perused the book so shelved it until a loved one suffered a health crisis recently. WHile researching online for health information I came across the movie, &#34;A Delicate Balance&#34; on Vimeo and learned about T. Colin Campbell's research that way. The next morning I dug out the book and haven't been able to put it down all weekend.<br /><br />I have studied nutrition as lay person since my teens and have been vegetarian for most of my life. I have considered veganism as an ethical path since meeting ecofeminist philosopher Marti Kheel (author of Nature Ethics) who advised us to adopt a vegan diet to respect the individual lives of animals. Though the ethics were compelling it didn't motivate me enough.<br /><br />This book has finally got my attention especially seeing my loved one face surgery and hospitalization due to one of the health conditions listed in this book as being caused by an animal protein diet. I love sustainability and environmental ethics as well and reading this book has produced an avalanche of compelling evidence that a sustainable life is possible without the inevitable slide into cancer, and all the other diseases of affluence Campbell warns us against.<br /><br />Campbell advises us to try it just for a month. We can all try giving up animal food for a month. Its easier than going raw for a month. He suggests we measure our blood cholesterol before the month of vegan diet and then again after. I am also going to measure my blood pressure throughout the test. When I suggested to my mom that we both adopt the diet to protect ourselves from disease (and the drug and surgery-based medical industrial complex) she mentioned that Bill Clinton had adopted a vegan diet and looked better than ever.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've ever read and the chapter on the dark side of science was one of the most compelling. I am grateful T. Colin Campbell wrote this book and consider his science and credentials impeccable. WOrds fail to do to justice to my gratitude. I will update my review when I finish the month long vegan test run.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Anyone who rated this book under 5 stars has no soul. I'm a tough girl and I pride my self on my little emotions. Reading this book a weeped like a baby. In public. John Green has ruined my life in this best way possible. I fell in love with all of these characters and just wish I could have more adventures through them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rate this because this is the best story ever and I would tell everyone to read it because it is a loving story
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|My grandson is 2 1/2 and he loves this.  It teaches coordination, fine motor skills and color recognition.  He never seems to grow tired of this wonderful learning storybook!  Highly recommend.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This app is so much fun. The graphics are amazing and it really burns extra time. The only thing I would change is the animal being right there in the beginning of the mission. I would like to walk around and look for the animal. This app is still a must have! Never deleting!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Told from the point of view of three different women, this novel takes the form of both detective story and romance. The challenges facing these very different women bring them to Sydney, to the same school, where their paths cross and their lives merge in uncanny ways. It's not an empty feel-good plot; very real as the women deal with problems that seem insurmountable.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|There was a lot of good parts but there was as good camera angels. But it was very good game.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|In terms of the beauty of language and the ultimate point arrived at through a haze of danger and drugs, and in terms of captivating readability, consistent characterization, and insight into the world of collectors' and museum art, The Goldfinch is a five-star book. If you are looking for an easy read that won't make you uncomfortable, forget it. If you just started your 12-step program, you, too, might want to leave it alone for a few years. These things aside, I felt that just marveling at Tartt's way with words made the 700+ page trip worth it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is the best app I have ever seen! If you love zoos, rescuing animals, then you'll love this app!
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I enjoy solving these puzzles. They work on my kindle with no problems. They could be longer though. I recommend trying them.
078322947X|5.0|This is a &#34;forgotten&#34; movie by W. Friedkin. While he strays from the original French version - &#34;Salaire de la peur&#34;, he keeps the grittyness and depressing overall feel of the first. Roy Scheider is amazing. I remember seeing the movie when it came out and had not seen it since! Glad I got it.<br />This being a DVD it has not been remastered and the overall details and colors are not as we are used to seeing them. But this is what Friedkin probably wanted.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although it takes a little while to get back into in the beginning you'll love this end to the Divergent trilogy. You won't believe what's outside the fence or the history the people in the city don't know. The last few chapters will leave you crying, then smiling again with the very end. All together a great book!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|This will make someone very happy.  I was happy to find such a deal for this brand new in package DVD.  The delivery was very fast as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As a rule I usually find sequels as depending too much on the first novel. This book while using the same location and many of the same characters, was  a compelling story in its own right. Yes the was mention on several occasions, but only as a reference to the history of the characters and locale. As A time To kill, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Very well written and keeps you captivated the whole time.  A must read.  I cannot wait to read the next one!
B006TZBGBW|5.0|Lots of songs I have never heard before<br />Great music<br />You won't regret buying this collection if you are a priest fan
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I love this story!! Mr. Fox is quite the debonair gent and so funny and engaging! I loved it more than I can say!!
0394818237|5.0|This book is interesting and fun for children to read. There are detailed drawings throughout and it teaches about everyone's jobs. Fun and educational.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Excellent  pass on invention of digital computing to make and break codes in WWII as well as the logic behind \\"in the cloud\\", eviction, etc.
B00E8B1358|3.0|i would have loved to see original characters ans explain more why storm shadow and cobra commander left destro to die, but i guess there will be a 3?..... idk but poor video quality to keeps stopping
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think this is cool. I want to get this app. It looks sooooooooo cool. I want to get this.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|MY OPINION: great special effects, maybe he shouldve adopted the kid idk, the happliy ever after was nice. happy he finally got rid of the chest peace
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Really, what's to say? It is, after all, Mumford and Sons. Love their style of music and it doesn't get much better than this CD.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|If you don't want ads in your game then buy this for a $1.  However, the game is nothing but a giant ad to pay for power ups.  Waste of time and definitely money.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Love, love, love this Jack White CD. He has such a unique voice and is capable of such variety, as shown by the selections on this  CD. Can't wait for his next CD!! Right up there with my love of the White Stripes.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|I already have McAfee Mobile Security on my phone.  Now my phone constantly tells me to upgrade taking me to Amazon's site even though I've updated it a million times.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|Good collection. It'd be an amazing one if it weren't for the GLARING omission of the first minisode with Paul McGann (The Night Of The Doctor) and &#34;The Doctors Revisited&#34; episodes 1-8, featuring all the classic Doctors. Why can't we get those too?
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I love this movie.  It was a bit intense in a couple areas for my 2 year old, but overall she loves it too.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game actually makes me crazy. I really hate the fact that if you want to keep playing you have to purchase more....I never do i just put it down until I have full lives again, not paying to play longer but i am sure there are people who do. I would have given this five stars if it didnt have in app purchasing.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I've spent a lot of time with this app.  I tend to like games that make you thinks, but are easy to pick up, and this is one of those games.  I like how it gradually builds in complexity and has multiple ways to solve each level.
B00319ECGK|5.0|The first Matrix is the best! If you haven't seen it and you're a sci-fi/anime fan, you're going to love it! Great action sequences, cast well, great photography, highly recommended.
B008JIWNYG|4.0|Green Lantern isn't one of my favorite characters in comics or even DC.  I do like Geoff Johns as a writer and I've liked Dough Mahnke since his days on Superman: The Man of Steel.  I think this is a good reintroduction the GL without getting too adventurous.  The artwork is quite clear and consistent, and Geoff Johns delivers his usual quality to a character who is already rich with history.  A good read, but not quite great.
0064440346|5.0|My daughter loves these stories! Book was in good condition and came quickly. They are ideal for kids that can read without help and stories are very funny, silly and thoughtful.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Nice app, especially since it was free.  Use it once a week to clean up space on my Samsung GS4
B001P06GX4|4.0|It is fun to play as family with my six year old. She is right now only happily arranging the blocks but we hope we will more hours of fun as she discovers some ways to corner us and win the game. Good game.
B008J2GAKU|3.0|The artwork was the strong point of this story arc.  I am not familiar with any of Snyder's other works, but I feel in the near impossible endeavor of introducing something new and vital to the Batman universe, he minimized the impact and intensity of Batman himself.  It was a nice read, but I won't ever go back to it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Great story.  Richard Armitage makes a wonderful alpha hero.  No sensual scenes but so romantic to see the H&H falling in love.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Joss Whedon is a genius, that unfortunately fox and the general american public failed to realize when this show had briefly aired.  Perhaps it is Firefly's limited run that makes it so damn amazing, because you have no choice but to be left wanting more.  Joss is best with his comedic timing, and quirky, yet compelling characters.  If you know anything of pop culture or cult hits, either way, you've heard of Joss Whedon's Firefly, and I just have to ask... why are you reading this review instead of watching this show?  Just do it.
B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|Character driven storyline executed perfectly. The storyline itself is good on its own but the meticulous development of its characters makes it great. One can't help but wish the best for Honor Harrington and wish we had her caliber of personality in our government and military in real life.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I want sure about this one - how could the shining be continued? Well, S.King found a way. Been a reader of his work since I was in HS, a very long time ago.<br /><br />Still can't understand why we haven't seen THE DARK TOWER made into a mini series - an epic series.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|a Fun freebie I got on a day when it was Freebie of the day. This has been a really fun game, the story moves slowly but you can option out of that, but I actually liked it. The hidden objects are definitely hidden, you have to search. It has various mini games between sections and its fun!!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|did not work for me any way i tried it.................................................................................................bad buy not worth the money sould have saved my money for something useful
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Absolutely engrossing and enchanting look into Los Angeles of the 1930's.  Haunting and atmospheric theme will not leave you alone for days after you see it.  Continues to reveal significant detail and &#34;ah ha!&#34; moments on second, third, and even fourth viewings.  &#34;Forget it Jake-it's Chinatown&#34;...will echo in your consciousness long after the closing title. One of Hollywood's Ten Best of All Time (my own personal opinion/rating).
B008EKMB82|5.0|One of the few books I will read again. A multi-layered book full of information New to me that has held my attention, but also made me read it slowly to really absorb and be involved with the characters and their individual time being adventure.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This novel should have rather been titled &#34; papillon extreme&#34; --- yes, all we need is love proves to be the old adage that simply does NOT solve every situation!!! A lesson gained
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie and wanted to know the background.  It made want to read the rest of the series.<br />Maryk0914b@aol.com
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Fast paced, engaging, one of John Grisham's best legal thrillers. Several surprises on the way to a verdict keep the reader wondering what is coming next.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|It's a very cute app.  I played it first to test it out and I think my niece will really like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read! It's way up with harry potter and Percy Jackson on the list of must read books. This book was so good! I have been reading since this morning. When you do nothing but read all day waiting to see how a book ends, instead of watching tv, or going to the mall, you know it's one of the best books ever. Peta dying just made me want to cry. It was so detailed. THIS WAS AN AMAZING BOOK AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES!
B0028R3NCU|3.0|the small size means its possible to insert this incorrectly into a usb port--and it won't work --so you have to flip it around.  Look carefully.  It comes in handy in an emergency but I don't think I would reply on this as a go to device given the size.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again Grisham allows you to immerse yourself into the characters and the plot.  This plot leaves you yearning for more. It makes you want to investigate and get to the answers. This again is a page turner. I recommend it to all. Can't wait for the next one.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Obviously an amazing show that was cancelled well before its time. It is encouraging that so many actors on the show went on to do other things, from Nathan Fillion in Castle to ...Summer Glau in many other cancelled series. But at least she is on Arrow now!<br /><br />Pretty sure fox network has cancelled countless shows that become sci-fi or genre classics well before their time.  This is no exception.<br /><br />How long before &#34;Almost human&#34; is cancelled?
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have learned more in four days than I ever expected. This is an awesome app. The greatest part is you can practice as much as you need to.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price, this is a really neat device. But it is not a fully finished product and I imagine more and more features are coming with updates. But to be able to stream netflix to the tv, and now hbo go, from tablet/phone is pretty cool.<br />I am more curious about the casting of chrome pages to a large screen for presentations, and this functionality could use some improvement but the price is right and should only continue to become a better value.<br /><br />it needs to add plex casting next though..
0545265355|5.0|By all means, this makes a great holiday gift that can be used later for reference. You'll enjoy the movies more if you've &#34;read&#34; your homework.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i love it. plenty of variety and nice sound affects. also i havent noticed any looping. Totally worth buying the full version.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|The book details numerous methodologies to reduce workout time while maximizing effects. The physiological changes for me have been outstanding.
0446555002|4.0|Just coz I'm a huge Agent Pendergast fan! Now I have to re-read the first 2 books of the Helen Trilogy!
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is one of my favorites by PAulo Coelho. For anyone searching for their life purpose or just starting out their spiritual journey, this book is perfect! I have book marked so many pages and recommended to all of my friends. Every person I recommend this book to LOVES it!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great story, interesting end. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the movie, and who they choose to play everyone.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Informative collection of items of critical concern to us all.  Shows how big industry is only concerned with $ and gives a %&$ less about people.  Between this, global warming and the Republican Party, might as well kiss your ass goodbye.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|One of my favorite bands, relive concert memories when hearing the songs.<br /><br />Great band with no I hate the world cuss cuss music.  Strong voice, guitar, and drums.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Had 9 friends at my house for Book Club to discuss it. Everyone loved it! We rank 1-5 on the books and it got 4.5.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Best movie ever made, Ingrid Bergman is sooo beautiful.<br /><br />Bogart improvised the line, Here's looking at you kid.  Movie trivia
B000002IAS|5.0|Excellent classic rock with some blues thrown in.  Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett are joined not only by Eric Clapton, but by Dave Mason and most of the Derek and the Domino's band members, with Rita Coolidge as one of the background vocalists.  The chemistry of this band shines in this high energy live performance.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|The music is great - I've never purchased the album, tape or CD, because I was always in a band that performed one or more songs off it (particularly &#34;Money&#34;).  So I finally broke down - had a teensy bit of &#34;disposable income&#34; that Barack didn't get  and purchased my own.  As I said, the music is great - but that damn &#34;we're so eco-friendly, we're gonna put this in a piece of cardboard that will have turned to dust by this time next year&#34; - no, I do not believe the &#34;icebergs are melting,&#34; the sky isn't any worse than it was when I was a kid...and if the government is busily building more highways, do they maybe know something WE don't?  Like, maybe, we ain't jonesing for oil after all, the gasoline companies are ripping us off to the bone!
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Keeps saying it needs Internet connection. ..I<br />have a good connection! No reason for this to happen. Why is it doing this?
B0044DEAUA|5.0|IT'S THE SECOND ONE I'VE OWNED. EASY TO SET-UP. CLEAR SOUND. CHARGES QUICKLY. COMPACT DESIGN AND MAGNET ATTACH WITH VISOR CLIP
B005HCI72O|5.0|Even on the fifth read Diana's writing is the same moving gripping read with every word perfect for the telling . All the strands of so many lives woven and crafted together by the<br />Master weaver. I am working my way through the series again before the next book comes out in 2014. Diana thank you for all the hours of pleasure you have  created. Hoping the TV series will come to New Zealand or be available on DVD.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|My 13 year old says it was a great book with an awesome ending. She normally does not like to read but she devoured Allegiant within a week.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is easy to set up and use!  I can stream Netflix movies and shows from my iPhone to our HDTV with no problems.  Picture is sharp and sound is excellent!  We are very happy with this purchase.

B0063GORYU|3.0|Not much of a challenge, I use this game when I want to win with out having to do a  lot thinking.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />I am pretty sure that The Hunger Games trilogy was my first time reading dystopia books. It was a nice change to have a little time away from romance. I could not be satisfied with soley reading dystopian books though. I do like to switch it up every now and then and toss in a different genre to read. However if it is normal for dystopian books to end like Mockingjay did, I am most certainly going to pass. I find myself angry right now.<br /><br />Lets start from the beginning.<br /><br />My teenage son has been after me for over a year to read this series. I finally did. I loved The Hungers Games and devoured Catching Fire. I burned through Mockingjay and then at the end of the book I wanted to throw it across the room. I was so angry. Mad. Disappointed. I wanted to lash out and yell at the author. I feel it was a waste of time reading the series that consumed my life this past week. I even watched The Hunger Games movie and then went to the last show at the theater to watch Catching Fire. I was so pumped going into Mockingjay. I feel...betrayed. Some may feel I am being overly dramatic but I was buried in these books and had forgotten to eat meals and go to the bathroom while reading them.<br /><br />To reveal the reasons for my frustration and anger would call for me to share a lot spoilers. Lets just say that reading this series has made me gravitate back towards romance because I need my happily ever after. I learned that about myself. I need that happy ending. I guess that is why I love romance books so much.<br /><br />I am going to still rate the series as a 5 but if I was to do them separately, 5 stars for The Hunger Games and Catching Fire but a lowly 2 for Mockingjay. Not just because the lousy ending but because it was disappointment after disappointment as I was ploughing through chapter after chapter.<br /><br />I talked about Mockingjay with my son and he says that he figured I'd be mad about the ending but it was still a good read. Right?but it was still a good read. Right?
B00GINENG0|3.0|My Talking Tom is a nice app but it will not show up when I tap it so I can not take care of my talking Tom,Oliver.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like this game, makes me want to come back for more on a daily basis. Thank you for the game.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really fun great time killer nice upgrades from previous versions on fb wish the Times where just a bit shorter but not overkill
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This is the kind of hidden object  game I like. It has story and chapters to complete. Though it is a bit easy.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best hunting game for kindle fire the graphics are amazing but the only problem I had was the movement controls and on how much the upgrades for the guns cost. Other than that it is amazing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game really sucks you in!!! It is so frustrating but you just have to keep on trying and trying. Then you try some more!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It  so much fun! There's goals and costumes and you save up bananas to get other things.  ALSO AS A  BONUS THERE'S MINION BEACH!!!!! BUT WATCH OUT THERS OBSTACLES. And you can challenge your self to beat your high score and earn prizes. So yeah u should get this it's awesome

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game rocks. You have all these coins to collect and lots of people to choose from. You also have missions to do and you can earn prizes when you collect a prize box. There is so much to do. I like to play this in my free time this is so awesome.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Sound quality and performance of the product was excellent.  The product performed as expected and did not disappoint.  However sometimes it sounds as if one side is working and one side isn't.  The problem usually goes away eventually though.  The headset is also very comfortable.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Angry birds star wars two is great but after I spent my .99coins and now it is free I want my money back
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I agree great graphics, levels get harder and more challenging. The only thing I would change is the different types of trees,<br /> should be worth more coins. Overall it's a fun and addictive game!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The author writes in such a real way that you feel you are seeing, doing and feeling all the things that Katniss Everdeen is doing, seeing and feeling. I find these books to be incredibly wonderful. And she has written a book with no profanities or vulgarities and I find that quite refreshing!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so amazing how you go into different worlds in this game!!! Also how you have so many character's to choose from in despicable me!
B00F3VOL38|5.0|It's been a while since I bought a new Beatles album...for obvious reasons.  My last \\"new\\" Beatles purchase was the Beatles Anthology series.  So it was curious and mildly exciting to see a Beatles advertisement on the neighbourhood Bus Stop showcasing the Fab 4 at the Beeb.  Hang on?  The Beatles being marketed in 2013?  Like we were back in the 1960s?  This must be something special.  And that is what On Air achieves - the Beatles in your living room.  (The Beeb's archived recordings can generally showcase alternative but sterile mixed versions for some bands)<br /><br />The Beatles recorded no less than 52 recording sessions for the BBC?  That was phenomenal and likely backbreaking for a band that was already overbooked and overworked.  The cracks do show in some parts of these otherwise impeccable performances.  Strained voices from the boys just came with the territory - along with the screaming girls.  But they were true pros and just soldiered on.<br /><br />The nostalgia and charm are well preserved - it does feel like we're tuned in to a long playing Beatles Radio session.  So Mission accomplished for the boys - and the producers.<br /><br />PS - Point taken about buying the CD with the liner notes.  I overlooked this and downloaded my purchase!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|They should have voice control<br />For robot v c.f. cucumber c.f. church c.f. but by th hibhibug hub Fuji uhh hu huh bugging.but that is also a paper
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|Good read. Makes you think about the world a little differently. And perhaps yourself too. Good read for educators and students alike.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|The game is way to awesome. Lol it is highly recommended by me. Thank you kindle for a great game with great graphics. Just like the computer.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Runs very well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;.  Gives me detailed weather info from anywhere I choose.  It's easy to set a particular location as the home location thus getting instant updates for that location in your notifications screen.  You can also have it use GPS to find the weather station closest to you and thus always get the weather report for wherever you are, a very useful feature when traveling.

B00C5R71U8|2.0|Not been much of a Kahney for a while but I'm pretty interested in Ive.  The author lost me when he basically said Ive isn't that special but any designer could have done what he did given Apple's resources.  he should have also talked more about Ive's new role as software designer in addition to hardware.  I'm a huge fan of Ive's hardware design but not so much software.
B00EO64S68|4.0|5 stars for the company that made it and customer service. 2 stars for binding. 5 stars for staying close to the in story description.<br />This is not the double day edition from the 80s. This is the Dutton Childrens book edition 1991 first edition.<br />Double day had red and green ink this one has purple and green. The double day edition has better ink and paper quality. If it had been the double day edition it would be worth the price.<br />The binding is hobby store quality. It could be improved. I have seen this leather ina hobby store as well. I think the leather is deer skin. Not the best for quality because it gets dirty fast. Meaning it soaks up skin oils. It will be an effort on my part to keep it clean.<br />Improvements that could be made:<br />1. Lower the price the way it is or<br />2. Bind it better and make the end papers the silk/satin more the way it was described in the book.<br />3. To keep this price i would recomend using the double day edition. i know it cost more but it can be had in poor condition for $20. restore it to its glory.<br /><br />I personally feel that i paid way way too much for this book. But i keep the 4 star rating for the fact that this was the only company that would be kind enough to take the trouble to make this. They know this is only for the fans or who else would pay this much for a book they never read.<br />With all that said. I feel this book will be cherished none the less. It could be improved but i am willing to live with its faults.<br />To potential buyer:<br />Get this book if you feel like you cant live without it. Im hitting it hard in this review only because i have restored books in terrible condition and improved them better than this one is in. the double day edition in hardcover can be had in new condition for the same price as this one.<br />Now on the upside the Auryn on the cover is exactly like the one in the film. It also comes with an extra Auryn to be worn around the neck.<br />its not worth $200 to me but thats just me. I hope that this helps a little. The previous reviewer was satisfied so you probably would be to if you purchased this book. Im being a little too hard on this i know.0 to me but thats just me. I hope that this helps a little. The previous reviewer was satisfied so you probably would be to if you purchased this book. Im being a little too hard on this i know.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Having fun with this game. It does crash or freeze sometimes on my kindle fire though. User interface is ok.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nice to see what has happened to Jake Brigance in three years.  Hope it is made into a movie, can they make Matthew McConaughey look only three years older?
0783233477|5.0|I am amazed how this movie snuck upon me in so many ways.  I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins so I would watch him anything.  I am becoming more a Brad Pitt fan with movies like this and Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were simply wonderful in Legends of the Fall I figured there has to be a reason to pair them again.<br /><br />When I did some research I realized that this movie is three (3) hours long and not a minute is wasted.  It is touching in so many ways and the actors are just wonderful.  The chemistry between these actors is amazing and the movie just feels classy and rich.  A touching movie in SO many ways regarding family, love, death, money, and once again life.  It lands very firmly on the principles of life that gives and takes.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Just saw this on TV.  It was fantastic.  I didn't get to see it in 3D, so I'm looking forward to getting this DVD.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I bought this as I had seen the original on HBO. It's nicely packaged and with my surround sound system should give a true feeling of what these guys went through. It's a great production!

1400049628|5.0|Now that I have read this book I have realized 2 things:1. If there is a zombie attack go up to the highest height you can and keep the zombies below. 2. I will probably die as I don't have any weapons that will kill them.  It was an interesting read though and now I feel I would probably last about 3 days in a zombie incident before I was turned into one as well.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Love this movie, my daughter is obsessed with it. She has to have seen it 100 times now. Funny, another great installment with the &#34;herd&#34;.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that it is a great game. I like that it's easy to get coins so you can buy more things like cars. Also, the game is fun and the fact that it's free you should get this game.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|While I would agree with some of the reviewers who said the writing was lacking in this final season, I have to say I thought the series ended as well as it could, given the circumstances set up in the previous season.<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILER ALERT - if you haven't watched the final season, you may not want to read any further.  Fair warning...<br /><br />I should say that I watched the final season as a whole - when the DVDs were released. Hadn't seen any of the aired episodes, so from my perspective, the final season was more like a long movie watched over a period of a week instead of months. With that said, I did have some (relatively minor) issues in the first 3 episodes of this season, with Deb having one meltdown after another.  Granted, she had good reason - but I felt some of that time could have been better spent developing other characters and expanding the plot.  I also felt the addition of Misuka's daughter was extraneous, and came at a time when the viewer would have been better served by a more intensive storyline of Dexter actually QUESTIONING the code.<br /><br />The psychiatrist, played by Charlotte Rampling, was an interesting twist.  The viewer was never really sure what her agenda might be - and I, for one, appreciated that approach, as compared to the shows that draw a fine line between dark and light, good guys & bad guys. Dr. Evelyn Vogel was an enigma - one never knew if she was Florence Nightengale or Dr. Lechtor - her ambiguous portrayal of the character kept me in suspense, and added an even darker element to Dexter's past - he finally met his maker, and didn't know whether to embrace her or kill her... undoubtedly a problem most humans face when coming face to face with their creator.<br /><br />Personally, I never cared for the character of Hannah, although I can see why she was reintroduced into the final season.  Harrison needed someone, and though I might have preferred some other solution, Hannah was probably a more suitable \\"match\\" for Dexter than any of his other romantic interests (including Rita).<br /><br />In the big picture, I felt the real \\"flaw\\" with the final season was that it seemed rushed and could have benefited from another 2 or 3 episodes that would have gone further toward tying up the loose ends.  I'm not really sure why Deb had to die, and that whole plot line seemed a bit contrived.  She just happens to get shot, develop a blood clot, and end up a rutabaga, which results in Dex having to essentially kill her.  In some ways, though, that pull-the-plug scene showed that Dex really HAD changed - from the emotionless psychopath to a genuinely loving brother/father, capable of self-sacrifice, capable of empathy.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said they felt he should have literally gone down with his boat, and Deb, in the storm.  And yet... I think the emotional impact of that final scene where he is clearly alone, goes to illustrate that he is aware of exactly what he is, precisely what he has done, and now he is \\"paying the price.\\"  He upheld the code (in the sense that he never got caught - rule #1), but the ultimate irony may be that he \\"caught\\" himself - in seeing himself for who and what he was, he knew he could no longer afford to be around anyone he cared about, and so he chose the ultimate self-punishment - what amounts to a living hell of enforced solitude, isolated from any possibility of redemption... or was the isolation itself his attempt at redemption?<br /><br />I have to say the series did not end the way I WANTED it to end.  No happy endings for anybody.  But I felt it ended the only way it COULD have ended, all things considered.  I tend to re-watch my favorite series once every couple of years - and I wonder how I will see it with a bit more distance and hindsight.  It would be interesting if some of the 1 & 2-star reviewers might post a follow-up sometime down the road.  I felt there was a lot more to be read between the lines... if viewers are willing to look.<br /><br />If I were going to review only this final season, I'd give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 stars to reflect my love and appreciation for the series a whole, and for those who made it all possible.  Thank you for an incredible 8 years!ook.<br /><br />If I were going to review only this final season, I'd give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 stars to reflect my love and appreciation for the series a whole, and for those who made it all possible.

B005N09L5C|5.0|If you have read the book, this movie will certainly give the reader a clear vision of what the book pictured. If one could rename the book and the movie to say 2084 I believe we would likely see these very happening then.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|love these types of games. its like your living out the mystery. you dont want to put it down. tganks nevosoft.

B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie, but it just fell really flat.  I guess I had to say something nice the scenery was really pretty, but the acting was pretty bad.  I would not recommend this movie.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Best of Grisham since A TIME TO KILL! As a white kid growing up in the Deep South of the 1940s and 50s, I believe Grisham captures what it was like to be black in the early 1900s and what it was like to be white. Let's have another shot of Jake Brigance and have it soon!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love her music and voice. Very soothing. Some of the songs I could relate to in my own everyday life
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Awesome. Artwork is amazing. I FELT THE ABYSS..INSide down in the creepy water.  Thrilling..actually got surprised a few times.  It has good hints.  Neat neat game.  Makes a person think and use the brain a bit.  Fun fun fun.<br />GET THIS ONE.  INTRIGUED.
0385523912|5.0|Gave me tremendous insight into the everyday life of North Koreans and how the politics in everyday life is unescapable......heart wrenching struggles.
0811870413|5.0|I've owned this book for a couple of years.  I consider myself an intermediate baker, having entered into bread baking through the no-knead method and looking for something beyond.  I have tried Peter Rinehart's books and while I very much like the variety he offers, I haven't been as satisfied with the product as I am with the Tartine bread.  I was initially daunted by the process, but have come to be very comfortable with it, falling into a routine and coming to understand how it best works in my kitchen, which is really what this cookbook is about: the method offered is very elaborate, but once you understand it and understand how the dough is supposed to be, you can adapt it to your purposes and the author encourages each baker to do this.  The product of these recipes is, by far, not simply the best bread I have ever made, but some of the best bread I have ever eaten.  It far surpasses the quality of the artisan loaves in my town (admittedly not SF, but the bakeries here aren't too bad).  The crust is shatteringly crisp, offset by wonderfully airy yet firm middle, with a mild tang from the sourdough (which also helps it keep nicely).  I usually bake one loaf and offer another up to a friend, which always leads to a request to learn how the bread is made.  I think it is really revelatory to many that you can make such a remarkable loaf of bread in your own kitchen, which is, again, exactly what the book promises.  The book isn't an encyclopedic reference for bread recipes and the breads that move away from use of the dutch oven, like the baguette or brioche recipe will yield results not really that different from a book like Rinehart's.  But if you want to learn to make transcendent country bread loaves, with some whole wheat and semolina variations, this is the book for you.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|this app was amazing.at first I couldn't download it... and when I finally got it, I was nervous that it wouldn't really work. as nervous as I was, I realized it was for nothing. this app is amazing. everything was in HD. really surprised about how adjustable and easy to edit the volume was. I paid a very low price and got every video and even more than youtube itself has. very good app, I definetely recommend it.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great family movie. Mostly clean and lots of action. If you are a fan of Marvel, this is a good movie to watch.
B00DJYK9ZU|3.0|I bought this album after watching their Austin City Limits show. It is OK, but far below their live TV performance.

Thanks tons for this game  and can't wait till next version comes out if there is one in the future !!!! .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My opinion is that this game is amazing . However it is a result that if you bump into something you can die.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Several good mini games, engaging story. Graphics and game mechanics are quite good. I really like this fantastic tablet game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love it! Very addictive :) it's really fun to watch and grow the dragons hoping to get even more. I like the challenges it provides to accomplish.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry. I fell in love with it by the first page. I greatly recommend it!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|i heard this book was sad and i didnt want to read it but i needed to know what happened and after i did i cryed and cryed. it was a great trilogy but i think the veronica roth could have written the ending better. i felt so bad for tobias. even though it was fiction and a book i felt really close to tris and tobias and wish tris would have lived
0316017922|4.0|The used book was in excellent condition, I'm so happy that Amazon offers used books at such great discounts.  The book was an interesting read...wasn't exactly what I had expected, but interesting nonetheless.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will make you cry but also smile.  The writing is pure genius and makes you feel smarter and more aware.
B00GO95BUU|1.0|GOOD WORK SCUMBAGS. $2.99 this morning, then Amazon apparently begins to understand how much money it can make and ups the price. Please return the price to it's original! Considering getting rid of my Amazon Prime over this, and will be sure to begin posting this on the American Doctor Who Facebook groups and forums starting now.
0689835604|5.0|This is my sons favorite book. He love's lifting the flaps . Not sure why but his favorite page is the baby in the bathtub. He giggles every time we get to that page.  Ine had to tape a few of the flaps because  of how frequent it's read.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Slow start but gathering pace to the breathless speed of the final d&eacute;nouement. The heroine is just believable and her selfish and spoilt manner is just about acceptable.  Excellent.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|Good mic for video, definitely better sound compared to the videomic but definitely not a full shotgun mic. This device will give you more control and better range than the regular videomic since it has a switch to change from -10 to 0 to +20 db. That is great for generic situations such as a music event vs a documentary but it doesn't give you anywhere near the control needed to adjust the sensitivity between a voice vs background noise. For that control you need an actual gain dial. Great for run and gun shooting but if you think you could use this for an actual film, forget it. Save your money for an actual sound mixer and shotgun mic combo.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Marvellously believable and gathering momentum for the final book in the Trilogy. What a tragedy that this gifted writer passed on
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Loved the series but was a little disappointed at the ending.  I'm looking forward to th movies of the series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final book is too full of impossible situations and I felt it was overcooked. The three books together as a whole are excellent. Who can forget Donald Sutherland as the President in the film.  The book is better to visualise everything however.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Great story and great movie.  Two great actors acting in roles they were meant for.  Highly recommend it for mafia movie fans.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Simply wonderfully crafted thriller with very believable characters. The writers experience as a journalist helped him trim and hone the<br />narrative flow which I found stunning.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Many people are super obsessed with candy crush, this game however is way better than candy crush and it just might become my new obsession.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Love this movie! Bought the 3D combo pack even though I don't have a 3D TV....yet! It's extra incentive to get one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best thing since Angry Birds lol I love it! Beware tho, it may put you into a rage while trying to clear some of the levels! Definitely a great &quot;time passer&quot; tho
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As always John Grisham writes a fun, fast , moving story. If you haven't read Grisham before you'll love this book. But for those of us  who read most of his novels, this one is a little predictable. Even the twist at the end isn't as surprising. But for those new to Grisham, it will keep you reading past your bedtime!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I believe that this series was absolutely amazing. The story is great. I am no pro critique, but I highly recommend the entire series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game. always a challenge..new things and places to explore. hard to put down. everyone should have this on their kindle
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a wonderful love story with sadness and sacrifice of family and friends. The deaths and misery are shown by soft smooth words
0804162727|5.0|Love the guide, it's beautiful to look at. As far as the guide goes, i think it is helpful. Don't know why the other reviewer gave it a 1 star
B009NF54ZE|4.0|A find the list of things game w interspersed match, find the dif, ans assemble the pieces puzzle.  Not exc iting but there is a linking story if you like.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Good free app for alarm use on Kindle. Up to four alarms can be set up with different alarm sound settings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG this is the best game I have ever played in my whole entire life! me and my sister are trying to get the baby!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Downloaded on my Kindle, included the professional narration. I am one of Mr. Follet's avid fans. I am looking forward to Book Three.<br />I have learned more about World War II history events (and remembering) from reading his books than I ever did from my history classes in high school and again in college! I love his mix of fictional characters in the nonfictional world events.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|A must read ... Cornwall does not disappoint!!! What a page turner... when does the next book come out??? I can't wait!!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, as a southerner, I was a little offended.  Somehow over time I have gotten over that.  I love, love, love the art direction in this movie.  The scenes are beautifully set up.  And the music is amazing.  My teen daughter watched this in English at school and also loves it and likes the music.  This movie made this music cool to teens, which is pretty impressive.  There's not much plot, it's more of a character study.  Think of it like an extended music video with a little bit of a plot.  I'm wanting to watch it again after reviewing it.  One of my favorite movies.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Great movie!  We enjoyed it and the Prime delivery was great!  Lots of fun and action. Funny scenes too.  Watch it!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My daughter loves this movie.  She says it's cute. She likes video games so she enjoyed the video game theme.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's not often you get paid to download a game but that's what happened. If you have patience, you can pay thru the early levels. I'm not into spending real money to speed up the progress of a game. It's a mix e diversion.
1451666179|5.0|I almost never laugh out loud, but this book made me laugh out loud.  I love Allie Brosh's work.  I bought this book at full price because I wanted to support her and brick-and-mortar book stores.  Oh, and I can relate scarily much to her writing about motivation and shame. If anyone finds a solution, they should let us all know!  Oh and she said the decision to be a cartoonist instead of a scientist was a bad one.  Well, I chose to be a scientist of sorts (computer), and I wish I were a cartoonist.  And I haven't published a book or made millions of people laugh.  Or make a smaller-number-but-still-a-lot of people feel less alone and less weird.  Thanks Bad Decision!
B00GO95TAC|1.0|$7.99 for an episode that's 15 minutes longer than a standard episode (which you normally sell for only $2.99)?  No thanks, Amazon. I was going to purchase it, but for THAT much of an price gouge, I'll gladly go with a pirated download.

B00DJXSKWU|2.0|MechCom defines a moment of a rts in the palm of your hands.  With the basic elements of an rts such as the base, combat, and resources, MechCom is worth your time. However, the glitch that freezes the game and flips the screen to the other side depreciated the value of this game.  Until the development team fixes this problem, do not spend your dollar on this game, which could be a turn, but failed into a crash.
B000GLKLCK|3.0|The recording of this collection is a little weak in term of musical dynamic even with normal stereo system. With today 5 or 7 channels surround sound system, this CD might need to be remastered or something...It's not bad, just bordering...But I'm satisfied!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I haven't played long, but So far it seems like a fun game with really<br />beautiful graphics and interesting characters.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Good movie and the action is nonstop. I do wish there was more exploration and a lot less earth. The Klingons are particularly cool and different in this movie.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Quick shipping, just as described, I have came back again to order this one!  Great price!  great stocking stuffer<br /><br />such a fun set!!!<br /><br />Great price

B00EZPCZ5O|2.0|I am a big AFI fan, I saw them the first time they where in Chicago in 1996 and probably 10-20 times since.  This CD is ok, but sounds like they just had to come out with a new CD, do the touring, sell the whatever and isn't as good as their early works.  Not so much different than any other band out there after they have released more than 3 records.  Still good music, just nothing terribly ground breaking or as good as their other works.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just getting old and remember jumping off the stage and rolling around the club in the late 90's.  When you put out 11's on a regular basis this is a step back.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|While many of P.D. James's previous mysteries are enjoyable, her recent work, &#34;Death Comes to Pemberley,&#34; is drawn out and disappointing.  The story is an extension of Jane Austen's classic satire, &#34;Pride and Prejudice,&#34;  and James's Pemberley Prologue is initially promising with her gleeful summary of the location, characters and plot lines from the source novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the care taken to extend the personalities of Elizabeth and Darcy, the original embodiments of prejudice and pride, as well as other family members and acquaintances seems to get bogged down in the telling.  By the time the murder takes place the events leading up have been covered in overwhelming detail - leading one to believe that, despite the prestige of Longbourn, life must have been very slow and dull, especially at &#34;Meryton, a small market town…not on the route of any tours of pleasure.&#34;<br /><br />Despite this much needed excitement, resolving the murder puzzle continues to take its time complicated by the musing and fussing of the various characters.  And the post mortem ending seems to leave many going on as they were, pre mortem.<br /><br />The challenge for telling this tale with much &#34;borrowed interest&#34; seems to have led James' astray from her own sharply amusing insights about her characters and their lifestyles on the way to and from a murder event.  Some of this distraction may be the desire to emulate Austen's own writing style which is what it was for a period without electronic media to truncate verbiage.  And some may be integrating different approaches to satiric observation, i.e. Austen's understatement versus James' pointed remarks.<br /><br />Another element possibly influencing reaction to the Pemberley storyline has to do with the relevance of the lifestyles of the main characters to today's world.  While P.D. James's first novel, &#34;Cover Her Face,&#34; introducing Detective Chief-Inspector Adam Dalgliesh during the 1960's was a refreshing escape from current events, the setting was still reasonably plausible for the present (I have reviewed separately at its Amazon location).  Somehow, this recent work seems to make the well-to-do characters, uncaring and out of touch with the suffering of the less fortunate supporting them.  Perhaps this is the intended dark side of James's story.<br /><br />T.S.

0143117564|5.0|I tried reading 'Against the Day' first, but was scared off by the length of it; gave 'Gravity's Rainbow' a try, but was scared off by the density of it; 'Inherent Vice', on the other hand, was an accessible and fun entrance into this author's legendary catalog.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love the perspective of death as narrator. This was a heartfelt special book. Anyone who reads it will remember it for a long time.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Way to sad to enjoy.. But the ending was so sweet and made me feel so much better for the old guy, that is will give 4 stars.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I will admit the two main attention grabbers for me when it first came out was the announcement that Daft Punk was going to be doing the music and the amazing sci-fi and graphics upgrade from the previous Tron. I have seen the first Tron movie and knew just by the commercials that this second one was going to blow away the first one. I went to see the movie on opening night with my co-workers and was completely amazed by how great of a movie it was; it surpassed my expectations. Though there are many who found this movie to be pretty lame or an overkill to the original, I didn’t see it that way. It was simply a continuing plot to the previous with extraordinary graphics of today’s age.<br /><br />The music by Daft Punk was a perfect fit for the movie! It was like taking their music from before and revamping it with today’s technological style of music. I had no doubts that they wouldn’t make good music, I mean come on, it’s Daft Punk! They’re awesome!<br /><br />Many may disagree, but I liked the characters that were chosen for this movie too. Everyone seemed to fall into their place and keep with the plot. Yes it was a bit cheesy or slow in a couple scenes, but it definitely kept with the flow of the movie.<br /><br />Getting a bit into the special effects, I was pretty amazed at how balanced it was. There was the perfect amount of lighting in each scene with everything lit up, but they still managed to focus primarily on what they wanted the viewer to see, not just all the dazzling lights and scenery. The suits everyone wore were pretty amazing as well since every one of them were custom designed for each actor. The scenes themselves were architectural wonders with all the different shapes and sorts of structures they used to be buildings, ships for transportation, and even the game grid that was designed for the coliseum floor. All so different from what we usually see.<br /><br />From how I see it, this movie’s objective, like many, was to take outof this world and put you in a whole new world of adventure and action. Specifically for this movie the bio-digital world in which the programs can have an equal amount of control in this world. With my bias opinion (haha), I give this movie a 9/10 rating and cannot wait till the next one comes out.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Cute. Love the guy's accent. :)<br />Touching, mischievous movie.<br />The second part is even better, but then you have to watch first one first, right?
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington once again does a fantastic job!  The message was powerful, the acting was powerful.  I found myself asking, how did he do it?  How did he physically represent every aspect of this movie.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As far as I am concerned this is the reason for a national healthcare system and should be mandatory watching.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|I am still trying to figure out why this won so many awards.  Yes, Natalie Portman did a fine job.  But why would such a great actress play such a role?  Very dark movie and one not to watch if you are feeling down to begin with.  Strange movie!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is fantastic, now I can see Netflix in my TV without have to change to a smart tv and all at a very low price
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Suspenseful, and entertaining, of course, anything with Mark Wahlberg is great!  The type of movie that when it is finished, you wish there was more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|who would have thought the world's fate  would be in the hands of kids? if only the buggers had known how to talk to mankind.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|Great movie, even better in blu ray. This dvd set was awesome. It had all of the Matrix movies for about $18 and in blu ray none the less. Great buy would recommend anytime or as a gift.
1582701709|5.0|I purchased &#34;The Secret&#34; several years ago and it was very close to my beliefs in Unity and explains the Universe. I also bought this book for my grandaughter. It explains what the Philosophers meant when they said &#34;as a man thinketh, so is he&#34;
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is the cutest movie! I love the way it combines all of the classic holiday and children's' characters and has them join together to fight the boogeyman. They executed this very well and is one of my favorite movies to watch with the kids.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|MY GOD I luv this game just total chaos that's what I like blowing stuff up and intense game play its totally worth the money BUT IT NOW!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Lots of reviews give you the technical details, so I won't dive into that.  I will say, however, that we love this little device.  The best way I can put it is that Chromecast simplifies the TV experience while broadening the TV's capabilities, which I will explain below.<br /><br />First, setup is a ridiculous breeze.  My only hitch was that I forgot a component of my network password, so I had to keep reenter it several times to get connected - which, of course, has nothing to do with the Chromecast and everything to do with my netwrok admin competency. :p  Aside from connecting to your home network, the Chromecast is as plug-and-play as you can get.<br /><br />Second, the user interface (UI) is breathtakingly easy.  Some people may disagree or misunderstand this statement, so I'll explain.  It ties into simplifying the TV experience while adding so much.  The thing is, there is no UI to learn.  If you have a smartphone (and, really, if you don't, then Chromecast is not for you), and you use Netflix, Hulu+, Google Play Music, or HBO Go, then you already know how to use Chromecast.  You simply load the app on your phone - which you already know how to do - load the content you want - which you already know how to do - and press the little box in the top-right corner of the screen instead of the play button.  From there, the app will prompt you to select your Chromecast device; once you selected it, the video or song starts playing on your TV.<br /><br />No more exiting and switching between applications on the PS3 (wasting time backing out of an app, loading the OS, then loading the next app, which takes a while on the PS3).  I'm sure other devices handle application switching more quickly than the PS3, BUT, those all involve separate UIs to deal with, remote controls to keep track of, and inputs to switch.  (Okay, that last one  may still be a sticky widget if you have a gaming console or cable TV..)<br /><br />To illustrate how simple it is to use the Chromecast,I set the thing up and promptly left to watch a movie with some buddies.  This left my wife home to play with the device herself.  She's no slouch with the tech, but sometimes she needs a little instruction - for which there was none, from either me or the device (I lost the manual immediately).  Halfway through the movie I received a text: &#34;So, I love the Chromecast...&#34;  It just works.  And it works well.  Well, mostly..<br /><br />Third, it looks great!  For the most part, that is.  Somewhat predictably, some apps are better than others.  Naturally, Netflix takes top spot ere.  Picture looks great, and there is virtually not stuttering.  Hulu+ looks great and bright as usual, but you run into stuttering because the folks at Hulu aren't quite as competent at dealing with bandwidth issues (though it's less of a problem than with the early days of Hulu+ on PS3).  Google Play Music works really well, with the only complaint that the songs (which sound as nice as they can on my TV speakers) take a little too long to load.  YouTube works better on Chromecast than it does the PS3 or, surprisingly, my phone - but it still buffers at times.  HBO Go.. well, this one needs more time in the oven.  I think the folks at HBO are optimizing movies and videos, because Taken 2 looked fabulous (with some stuttering in a couple of wide-angle scenes) while standup comedy specials (Lewis Black and Lewis C.K.) were a gods-awful mess - complete with dropped audio.  As the content providers spend more time with their apps, I expect the quality to improve further.<br /><br />Chromecast tab browsing is a mixed bag.  I got some videos to work just fine, but results will vary.  The biggest issue by far is the picture appears jittery as you navigate within a page.  To be sure, this is not a good option as a main screen for browsing the web.  If, however, you simply want to show others what you are looking at or working on, it works just fine.<br />For those looking to casting a tab asa workaround to Amazon’s idiotic grip on Prime Video: I don’t think this will work.  I tried it and wound up unable to view any Prime videos via Chrome (forget casting).  I sent in an inquiry, and Customer Service has replied with some troubleshooting steps.  I hope to resolve the playback issue with these steps.<br />Fourth, it is incredibly convenient.  This is sort of a repeat point, but that’s because it’s so very true.  While you may lose your remotes in your couch, you always have your phone in your pocket.  You don’t have to remember a bunch of button configurations across the array of remote controls for your entertainment center.  In fact, most apps will let you lower or raise the volume of the TV right from your phone.<br /><br />This is an almost five-star product.  In fact, I would probably give it a 4.5 if that were possible here.  Google needs to work with developers on quality issues, and we need to see more apps that work with the device.  Until then, it's still a great little dongle that is definitely worth the $35.<br /><br />ps: I'm hoping to see games in the future.  This could be a very cheap, stealth console device that specializes in party card games (your cards are in your hand - on your phone - while an animated dealer and casino is on screen), tun-based strategy games and MMOs (lots of potential here, actually, including the ability to have multiple players on a single screen), and other party-based games.  I haven't seen any news on this front, but the possibility very much exists.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Love spending my weekends with James Rollins! Well, his  books. LOL.  Especially the Sigma Series. So glad they are available as ebooks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the best game ever!!!! I love love love love it make a dog version then we get th  party over the roof
B000NYT1M6|5.0|I bought this for a 3 year year old boy and he adores it both for ruggedness and versatility. He is a tough little lad with a tough, 'trucking' father and he enjoys strong, durable toys with which he can emulate his dad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Splitter has always been one of my favorite games I've played it for years a fun way to kill some time while waiting in doctor's office or other places
B002PWB7C6|5.0|Great version of a great classic show. Director Mann is awesome at dark seedy thrillers and action. The two actors are great together and have natural chemistry.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best puzzle games that I have played. Great graphics. Good storyline. Overall it is a good time pass game which I really enjoyed. Keep it up guys.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|Great Story & Great Acting. Overall a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. I love movies based off books.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This is a pretty good first person shooter. I think there can be better maps and more weapons that were cheap. And take weapon repair off please. Other than that, AWESOME!!!
B00C68JXAW|5.0|Excellent picture quality.  It was great to see Sean's, ONLY, production efforts, of the great Bond series.  Fast service with product arriving early.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Love these games but spoiled by usual in-game buy this buy that. You can't progress easily after a while and becomes increasingly more frustrating. However free game so what do you expect....
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Great BD transfer with wonderful sound track to match.  Love the sound track, and wish Patrick was still with us to do more movies.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Weak story line. Preposterous like most Bond movies, with no character development; but can be fun to watch while you are doing something else.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|The 2010 reissue of BSG Complete series (Silver box) is what I bought and its awesome, packaging is some of the best I've ever seen in a DVD set! Make sure you get this Silver box edition cause the earlier Black box edition is the worst packaging I've ever seen, and in that old edition the discs are only in paper cases crammed into the box whereas with this 2010 reissue the are all in plastic DVD cases.
B000FBFML6|5.0|Hobbs words draw you into a compelling journey as you experience the twists and turns as fate throws his weight around. You felt every anguish and heart ache as he deals with loss and new beginnings.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but it won't update from the Halloween version to the Christmas version(Not that I don't get to play anymore)
B000FBFMIO|5.0|The Farseer Trilogy  is on the top of my fantasy series list and I was overjoyed to find that Hobb had continued the series in another trilogy, Tawny Man. Fifteen years have passed since Fitz' quest to save the Six Duchies. She did a great job blending the series together yet keeping the distinction of the passing time.
B005MMY9A8|2.0|Story is abbreviated, plot confusing, love interest manufactured. Outside of the special effects, movie is a bore. Need a better effort on the next one. This character has always been my favorite but Marvel did take the same care in creating this as they did with the first Iron Man.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Hobb is a master at dragging her characters through a kaleidoscope of human emotion.<br />I have read a lot of fantasy fiction and put this series very close to the top of the list.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a sport fun and strategic game. It makes you think and only gives you a certain amount of lives. If you have Facebook you don't have to wait if you don't have Facebook the waiting for is 5-10 minutes.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|A beautifully crafted look into a future here and now when the essential role of consciousness to all subsequent experience will be understood and accepted. Science has come full circle from the Sanskrit.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Love this app especially with the new update and you can log in to your account and also chat no regrets
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative and well written book.  At times the text can be somewhat technical but overall it's easy to read.  I learned a lot and I would highly recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it is available for the kindle fire. It is a highly addictive game a must have game. If you haven't played it try it out
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I play castleville on Facebook and enjoy it very much. This gives me the same game only better. Quests are much easier to complete and it allows you to advance quicker. Love it!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|My book club really enjoyed this book. The conversation was strong with many details. We felt a lot of connections.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you read the book and see the movie it's even more meaningful.  The book brings out alot of the emotions and then seeing it just makes it more powerful.  Would recommend for anyone liking action.  Has deeper meaning if you look at it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the characters. They were both powerful in their own way. The love was strong and pure. More, please!
006202406X|3.0|I was so upset with Insurgent but thought I'd still read this book to finalize the trilogy and hopefully save the story for me.... I both loved and hated this book, I really enjoyed it and then was soooo happy I read a copy from the library instead of just buying it. As much as I enjoyed the first book, I should've stopped there...knowing the rest of the story was time consuming and as others have said depressing. If you're not the happy ending kind of reader you'll love it, otherwise this isn't the book for you. If I hadn't read the last couple chapters I would've really liked this book....
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Gladwell has always done a good job of taking scholarly studies and making them easy to understand and easy to apply. With David and Goliath, Gladwell demonstrates how to see the advantages that others have labelled as disadvantages. Then he explains how these \\"disadvantages\\" have been used to overcome enormous odds.  Well worth reading.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|To be honest I am not a huge Lady Gaga fan as most of my musical choice is rock or smooth jazz (depending on mood) but there is something that really grabs my interest in this song.  It could be the music video that came out with it but I also like the tune.  The over blending vocals are appealing and the punch at the chorus is a great musical choice.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is so well made that we have watched it many times and I read the book because the movie is so good. It was interesting to read the book and see where the dialog for the movie is straight from the book in many places, as it should be. The book can go into some more detail because it does not have time limits, but the movie represents the book well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really like this book. The author does a good job showing Katniss as a person and why she is the way she is. At times you forget she is only 16 and yet she has been supporting here family for four years.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter's exploration of spiritual matters connected to his life is of interest to watch. Although a bit stereotypical at points, still a good continuation of the series.
B007CW2FCA|4.0|I've spent the last few weeks listening to this set side-by-side with Andras Schiff's recent cycle, still unfortunately only available in single volumes rather than as a boxed set. [[ASIN:B000AOEH4G Beethoven: The Piano Sonatas, Volume 1: Opp. 2 & 7]] Arrau's cycle was recorded some 40 years earlier, so one would expect Schiff's digital recordings to have greater depth and clarity, and they do.  What surprised me was that I consistently found Schiff's playing to be more buoyant and more expressive.  In comparison, Arrau often seemed too polite on the slower, quieter passages, and too strident on the louder passages.  With many other recordings of these works by Brendel, Gilels, Pollini, etc. in my collection, I doubt I'll turn to Arrau very often any more.
B0068THAGY|2.0|Not a great story, although well acted by the child lead.  Somewhat Entertaining - would have given 2 1/2 stars if that was an option.
B00742GBDM|4.0|Very entertaining. It's great also that there are subtitles for the non-native speakers and people with hearing problems. However these are a little bit shifted...
B00G32OMF8|1.0|A talky, boring follow-up to two very good films.<br />Fast-forward is so very welcome in this disappointing self-serving little flick.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Such a good read that keeps you hooked. The author writes in such a different and unique way that keeps you interested
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Play this game it's the best driving game ever handling excellent game for the whole family so start your engines race fans cause this is it
B006LSZECO|5.0|Half way thru this book and have no idea what will happen next. Really enjoying it; the writing style is different in a good way.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Really enjoyable quick read. It was interesting to hear what prison life is really like. It also opened my eyes to problems with our justice system.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I've been associated with commercial law for over four decades an it never fails to amaze me how Grisham describes totally flawed individuals in the richness of color and depth and manages their redemption. Good, bad and mediocre lawyers caught up in a web of legal machinations. Sound civil procedure set out on a platter for us, with all characters performing for us in a living drama. This book isn't Judge Judy - it's the real deal - A Harvard man breaks free from the ivory tower legal world of the mega-firm to wallow in the underbelly of the legal world to bring us to an uplifting end game. I not only recommend the novel, but will await the film and gleefully see it. This is a good one.
0312305060|5.0|One of my favorite books.  3 ages, 3 women and deep emotions.  From beginning to end I could not put this down.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|It is a good book to pass the time. It can't decide if it wants to be an action or suspense.
0375507256|3.0|I struggled with this book.  I really wanted to read it but, it just didn't grab me.  I have abandoned it for now.  I could see how it would roll out beautifully but, again it did not capture me in the first 100 pages.
0345529057|5.0|I love this series, but DOT NOT buy the 4-book paperback version - the very first book is missing some of the most important chapters! I had read these books before thankfully, so I could understand what was happening, but suddenly I was very confused about why a key character's death was never told from anyone's point of view except in retrospect...Somehow chapters 61-65 are missing. I will try to upload a picture to show how the page numbers jump 60 pages.<br /><br />The books themselves are fantastic though, so definitely find a good version to read!
0763621803|5.0|Great book to share with young children when talking about foods.  Also, a nice tool when teaching children the language concept of 'negatives'.  Cute story that encourages children to use their imagination.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'm really getting hooked on Lee Child's work.  I love the fact that his hero makes few mistakes, yet he still manages to make you sit on the edge of your seat.  I can hardly put the book down!
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Fun yeaaaa does not get dull or boaring,  could not put it down, works good on kindel fire good price for lots of fun
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A bitter-sweet moment has come. The end of the Wheel of Time. After a year and nine months of reading, with numerous books thrown in between, I turned the last page. The Memory of Light was all that I hoped it would be. A huge battle ragging in the real world, with a stand off of good versus evil, as depicted by Rand and the Dark One. A great series has come to an end, and now I am not sure what to do. Though it does look like Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archives will be promising.<br /><br />P.S. Thanks Sanderson for completing the series on a high note.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Still needs work.  Streams great from HuluPlus but....  a series of 2 or 3 commercials run every 5 minutes  and for a reason I cant figure out the show streams well yet the commercials stream extremely choppy making one commercial seem to last forever.  very annoying.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game rocks and its free to download which isn't usually the case for the more enjoyable games. kudos to the creators
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|Well good game but controls on kindle fire slow take some getting used to but it is still good game play and story but if your not going to buy stuff with real money it makes game hard
B005LAII80|5.0|yes, stallone was great. BUT, move over sly! here comes Karl Urban!!! he f***ing delivers hard!!!!!! (the 3D movie theater release was superb! ) if you enjoyed the story of dredd, and are not dismissed with many...many, violent graphic sequences then watch and enjoy!!! a great vision of how a remake should be done!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Perfect music for working out.  Dance to it, work out to it.  High energy and beautiful lyrics.  Helps me remember the wonderful story.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|There are those who don't seem be able to stand this series, complaining of the narrator's accent and reading, and also the way it challenges some established (especially Hollywood/US- centric) interpretations of film history. On the first point, Cousins speaks the way many people from Belfast speak and he can hardly be blamed for being Irish.  On the second point, it's obvious going in that this work is a personal interpretation of film history that's intended to be thought provoking and challenging. It is not intended or presented as a standard historical overview, rather it's &#34;an odyssey&#34; just as the title declares. If you're looking for a traditional historical overview that leaves your pre-existing prejudices in tact, you might steer clear.<br /><br />The attempted scope of the work is impressive. Hundreds of films, many of which will be unknown to an American audience are mentioned and many quoted (clearance must have been a nightmare). There are some brilliant observations and connections made. Sometimes Cousins attempts stretches he can't quite make, and some of the interpretation gets a little precious, but even in this the work is instructive. The interlude footage contains many visuals puns on what's being said if one watches carefully, and it's fun to figure these out. The interviews with writers and directors are shot in an anti-cinema style that those wanting something that looks like Discovery Channel talking heads may find off-putting. Again there's more method there than may at first meet the eye.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's challenging and frustrating at the same time.  The only real problem is that you will lose track of time when playing this game.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|I'm a big fan of these authors individually and when they are together.  It was a fast fun read the only reason I gave it  a 4 is because I missed Vincent and the New York setting typical in Pendergast novels.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|One of my favorite Diana Krall albums.  I love bossa nova and this is a very chill relaxing cd.  You can play through the whole cd and be put in a great mood.  especially nice while driving down the coast.  I read a lot of negative reviews but I think this album was great and written the way it was for a reason.  Instruments and Voice is balanced just right.  This is a CD you can play when it is rainy outside and just wanna stay in and spoon with your girl.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|I especially liked it because it told the story of Wyatt from boyhood up....not just his &#34;battles with the law&#34;.  It seems he had a good upbringing, which I appreciated.  I saw this on TV.....bought one for myself and one for my son.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Enjoyed the read immensely. Love to see the bad guys get it. Hugh Jackman, should be Reacher,<br />In the next movie. He would be great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is really fun and very addicting.  It's kind of like playing the slots in Vegas. It's a good thing you time out every so often or I might never go to work. Love it!!!!!
0618918248|1.0|Author uses contradinting sources and says that because they contradict there is no god.  These sources don't have to agree to mean that any one of them is true, only if they were all true would the sources have to agree.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I am not able to access on my Kindle maybe my Kindle is not set up for this app, luckily this was a free app
B00E7SXRHY|5.0|Great job on this reissue. Sounds very balanced and clear. I'm glad Steve Albini took the reigns on this remaster. After the horrible Nevermind reissue I was skeptical, but after hearing Serve the Servants, I felt much better about it. Very solid
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Let me start off by saying I really like this game its fun creative and fairly chanlingeing at times. That's of course not to say its perfect by anny means but it is a mobile game so that is to be expected. Now lets talk about the good its very fun and a good time killer its only 99 cents and its all around a good game. Now for the bad well there really is not much to say honestly the bad are only annouences such as I cant figure out how to delete itemes I have placed and you only get 3 charicters now you can buy a lot of others but it costs another 99 cents per pack wich seems a little ridiuclus considering that its a payed game. but none the less it is decently worth the 99 cents in my opinoin.
B00AG477QU|5.0|This record is incredible. All of the guys in FIDLAR are really putting the work into it. There is a ton of raw energy pumping through every single song on this. I know most of the lyrics are pretty similar on each song, but every song can stand on its own. Great live band as well, can't wait to hear their follow up record. Max Can't Surf, Stoked and Broke, Gimme Something and Cocaine are favorites. F**ck It Dog Life's A Risk!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cute game ! It is such a cute game well made graphics!! My son also loves the game! Can't wait for more
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great book I just wish it could have been a little longer and the fight between Rose Dan and Abra more elaborate :-)
076780421X|5.0|My dad loves this movie so I had to get him a copy and it came in great condition, thank you.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book!  Written from the perspective of the dog is a great way to experience this story. I referred this to my Mom to read & she has referred it to @ least two others.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|this app is cool I really like it I like the way they created an app based off of a phone feature
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It works exactly as advertised and allows for a wide range of options.  Set multiple alarms, Change the sound, volume, time to max volume and much more.  Even has vacation mode which I found very useful when it woke me up on my first day of vacation.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|This series always has and always will be a favorite of mine, a truly engrossing tale that I can never put down
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LUV IT!!!! Amazing I have been playing it since September 1st! Got to get back to playing my game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Ok this game is awesome and add me on PET SHOP STORY that is also a really good game my I'd IS imtherealawesome  also on movie star planet a even better game ADD me awesome walking here the games that I just suggest are online games! Thanks
B0089LOG02|5.0|I Really Enjoyed This Book And I Was Left Wanting To Hear More About The Characters And Their lives. A Reunion With The Sister's Family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it,  so addictive. Shouldn't have gotten started, lol some of the levels are very hard but u have to keep trying.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain went through a lot to make it to Nashville.  Her voice and love for the music shows in here songs.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not usually a Stephen King fan but I highly recommend this book.  It may have been better because of when I read it.  Just finished it today, November 24th.  Anyone who has had any interest in the assignation and the conspiracy theories that surround it needs to read this book.
0345529057|5.0|A good starting collection of this series that is compact and easy to store.<br />I got this for my son who is 20 and he has enjoyed reading it very much.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|We are big Dexter fans--absolutely loved watching the show.....until the final season.  It's like watching a cartoon version of the show.  The jumps in 'reality', the spotty, rushed, jumpy, weird storylines.....the final episode--ohmygoodnessthefinalepisodesigh....truly, skip the last season.  Read the spoilers instead and save hours of your life.

1451675046|5.0|The book being reviewed is &#34;The Magic of Reality&#34;. It is authored by Richard Dawkins and illustrated by Dave McKean.  I wish I had begun to read it sooner. I had put this book aside for months after buying it because the description on the back cover said it was recommended for young readers. I had thought to myself, &#34; Oh! I accidently bought a children's book. I guess that I will set it aside until I find a suitable child to give it to.&#34; Now that I have read it cover-to-cover, I think this book is equally suitable for adults. I would even go so far to say that many adults would benefit more substantially from this book than young people would. The school system is designed to cover science with increasing rigor as the student progresses grade-to-grade. Thus, most children will learn what this book has to teach if they stay in school. On the other hand, polls have told us over and over again about the shameful level of scientific ignorance in our country. There is no system in place to reeducate the adults long out of school.  I strongly suspect that Dawkins wrote this book was in an effort to help combat the pervasive scientific ignorance.<br /><br />Curious and intelligent youngsters will no doubt benefit too. Admittedly, there are colorful pictures adorning nearly every page and that is an attraction for youngsters. Sometimes the pictures help make the text more understandable.  Other times, the pictures merely are an adornment to attract readers, who shy away from text-only  books. Even so, when I read what Richard Dawkins was explaining in the text, I thought of many adults, who have a weak understanding of science and could benefit from this book immensely. Many people only want a simple and understandable explanation of the science involved in some area. They want to be spared excessive elaboration and new technical jargon. Dawkins wrote this book for such readers.<br /><br />Now, Richard Dawkins is a zoologist by education and a prolific author of books, which teach different aspects of evolutionary theory to a popular audience. He has a flair for making his books both educational and fun to read. In this book, Dawkins has boldly reached out beyond his usual scientific domain and attempted to explain phenomena from many scientific  disciplines. He ventures into cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics, geology, and many other fields. In my opinion, he did it both very accurately and very skillfully. The late Isaac Asimov was another prolific author, who had a flair for decoding science for  a popular readership.  This was a half century ago,  and though he did a brilliant job of covering many scientific fields, I can never forget one blunder that he made.  Plate tectonics theory was in its infancy back then and Asimov declared it was ridiculous to believe that continents  could actually move. I couldn't help recalling that blunder as I enjoyed the exquisite job that Dawkins did in teaching us about continental drift and plate tectonics.<br /><br />Dawkins arranged the book so that a chapter began with a question. For example, What is an earthquake? He then may touch on some familiar examples and  historic examples to show what he is talking about. Then he reaches around the world for examples of myths that have been used to explain earthquakes to fearful people looking to understand. In the case of earthquakes, he provided two examples: 1) from Japan, land floated on the back of a gigantic catfish. When it flipped its tail, the land would shake. 2) from New Zealand, Mother Earth was pregnant with her child, the God Ru. When the baby kicked or stretched in the womb, the Earth would shake. Next, Dawkins would explain earthquakes as understood by scientists today. He used this pattern of Question-Myth-Reality often in the book.<br /><br />Dawkins also developed the theme of healthy skepticism. If you are presented with three possible explanations for an event, he suggests that you rate and compare each ofthem in terms of believability. Is &#34;A&#34; more probable than &#34;B&#34;, but less probable than &#34;C&#34;? He guides the reader through several examples and explains why he thought one explanation was the most  believable out of the provided list. What he was actually doing in my opinion, was teaching the reader to think more  like a scientist. In one of my first jobs, I reported to a physicist, who was a practicing agnostic in the general sense of the word. The job was at Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago and it involved the design and construction of a powerful atom smasher. My boss was taken aback by my brash overconfidence in my judgments and proceeded to teach me the kind of thinking that Dawkins is advocating. My boss felt there were no absolutes and that everything was to be placed on a scale of believability. I am grateful for that mentoring so long ago, and now feel that his method is the key to thinking like a scientist.  It is also a system for distinguishing between reality and fantasy. You can operate on solider ground.<br /><br />Do I recommend that you read &#34;&#34;The Magic of Reality&#34;? I definitely do! Even if you believe that you already know all the science covered in the book, it is worthwhile to review what you know. If your science knowledge is incomplete, you will greatly benefit from this book. Moreover, it will be fun. Dawkins has a skill in presenting material in a delightful manner and for me at least, the pages flew by. The myths are a beautiful contrast to the scientific explanations. They are enjoyable to read and illustrate how far man has advanced. After you have read it, pass it on for others to enjoy. We sorely need rational thinking voters in this complex world.<br /><br />Ralph D. Hermansen,  November 24, 2013them in terms of believability.

B009NF54ZE|4.0|Very good mixture of puzzles.  I didn't think it would keep my attention for very long, but I was mistaken.  Great job with the graphics and blending objects into the backdrops.  I will definitely look at three other Nevosoft products.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Thank you! Love the series. Can't wait for more!!! I was told from a friend to read and I'm so glad I did!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game just kept on giving. It was very exciting! I would love to see more games like this in the future! Thanks for the creativity!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game has sweet graphics awesome guns and cool effects and its free!!! i would pay a couple of dollars 4 this sweeettt game!!!=)
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Love this movie. Suspenseful kept me hung on their every word till the end. The ending surprised me so much!
B0000E1WKE|3.0|First I will say I have loved Whitney Houston since her first cd came out 1985 Whitney Houston.  She to me is the greatest female singer of all time.<br /><br />Now with that said let me review this cd, The First Noel vocals=3 1/2 out of 5 stars production 2 out of 5 stars, The Christmas Song vocals=4(would be a 5 but the ending with her say Merry Christmas in every language and then her trying to hit that high note at end when her voice was just not giving it) production=4, Little Drummer Boy vocals=5(for Whitney and her daughter actually one of her best vocals on the cd) production=3(too much was going on in the song should have been more stripped down especially since Whitney was in good voice), One Wish(For Christmas)vocals=1 1/2(travesity she should have been made to redo this vocal her voice was in no condition to sing this song, thank God for the choir) production=3 1/2(the only thing that saved this from being a disater), Cantique De Noel(O Holy Night) vocals=4 1/2(she is in fine voice on this) production=5 one if not the best song on the cd. I'll Be Home For Christmas vocals=4(fine voice on this  one) production=5 another gem. Deck The Halls/Silent Night(why the hell they combined both of these songs is beyond me) vocals=3 1/2(the vocal arrangement on this really saves this one) production=2(and I am being nice). Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas(this song when anybody sings it grates my nerves but Whitney does something special to it for me)vocals=4 production=3 1/2. O Come O Come Emanuel(after Cantique De Noel=O Holy Night this is my favorite song on the cd)vocals=5 production=4 1/2. Who Would Imagine A King and Joy To World I actually don't count because these songs she recorded in 1996 on The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack where her voice was in way better condition.  All in all it is ok,  I wish some of the vocals had been re-done when she was in better voice but I don't regret buying it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Whenever I'm out and I hear the theme music or see the familiar graphics on someone's phone, I simply have to ask, &quot;Hey, what level are you on? ... Oh yeah, I was stuck there for a while too!&quot; It's fun interacting with others and seeing how everyone loves this game as much as I do! I challenge myself to see if I can get three stars in every section, very entertaining.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is the best game ever you should really get this game you will not regret it it is is worth the price
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Back to being a Chisholm fan! This is a story well written. There are at least 5 stories intertwined here ...racism, the law, disjointed families, holographic wills, history of the south especially Mississippi, Georgia, Texas. If i thought more about it... i could probably see more stories. It is as if each story was written separately and then very skillfully woven together. The pace is perfect as the reader is slowly and carefully led to a very surprising ending that neatly ties everything together.  Well done.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|This is an amazing movie its great for kids and adults alike. Great animation and a wonderful story line. I would definitely recommend it to family members and friends.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I have conflicted feelings about this series.  While I think it is well done, it is a bit more violent than I would like.  The suggested age range for the book is 12 to 17, but I often listen to books in the car with my children and we do rotate in young adult books since we are listening together.  By being together we can pause the story and discuss, pose questions and explain as we go.  I regret that I started this series with them as the senseless disease that causes sufferers to go crazy is a very scary concept and not really explainable.  It fits in with the Walking Dead and the zombie genre to me.  Had I done better research before we started the first one I would have skipped these books with my kids.  On my own I think they would be a different experience.  They are suspenseful and scary and pose questions about catastrophes and government's role in the aftermath.  I think I could have focused more on the story and less on how to talk about it with my kids.<br /><br /> Mark and Trina were on some future version of a subway when the solar flares hit.  They survived the chaos and met a group of people they would then spend time with in the post flare world of melted polar ice caps and people fighting each other for survival.  People are rebuilding and working together until bergs start arriving with darts and shooting people.  From there begins the quest to find out why the people in the bergs are shooting these darts, why people are going crazy and if the two are connected.  It is a fast paced story full of some pretty big horrors and big revelations about what people are capable of in the name of survival.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  I have always been a fan of John Grisham and this was a good one.  I look forward to his next one.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I wanted to love this book, but I didn't.  It isn't that I disliked it or didn't enjoy it, but it was too easy to put down and walk away from.  It lacked the sticking power of the first two books where it was hard to break away and do something else.  I was able to put this down for days at a time.  Part of me gets that way when I know a series is almost over, I want to prolong what is left of the storyline, but I think at the same time the last installment of any trilogy is hard and where readers start to get the most critical.<br /><br /> Tris and Tobias are living in Evelyn's post faction world with a new movement afoot, the Allegiant are forming to rebel against the anti-faction order that has been imposed on Chicago.  Meanwhile, many are wondering about the message about the need for the Divergent citizens to leave the city to help heal the world.<br /><br /> The outside world reminded me of The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games.  There are issues of control and issues of who is more worthy of time and attention.  Is the reason for why we act the way we do all because of our genes, or do we have some control over what we do with what we have?<br /><br /> I don't want give any spoilers, but I am conflicted over the ending, I can see why Roth chose the route she did, but I would have liked to have seen it all go a different way.  I still look forward to seeing what is done with the movie version of Divergent, but this story let me down a bit and took both Tris and Tobias in different directions than I saw them in the other books.  Tris got much more regimented and set in her ways, passing judgments and holding people up to very high standards and expecting others to go along with her way or to be quiet and Tobias, who was always so strong and sure of himself, succumbed to a lot of self-pity and whining.  Almost as if Roth took the normal stereotypes of male and female characters and flipped them.  Not sure it works all that well either way though.
B00CEF014E|5.0|All I can say is – WOW. If you like suspense and trying to figure things out, this is a great story. It is full of twists and turns that really surprise, and I really enjoyed it. It is a quite violent, but then again, it fits together well. I love the ending too, and was genuinely happy to see the way things turned out. It has the perfect font for this type of story. Word choice was a bit upper level, but not so much as to detract from the work itself. It was also a bit poetic, if you like that sort of thing. I was on the edge of my seat, so to speak and I think anyone who enjoys this type of book won’t be able to put it down. However - it is definitely NOT for everyone, so take it to heart - its is DARK and you should be aware of that if you dare...Great job Damian!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What a great sequel!  I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, the characters, and the setting.<br />It's been a great read, and I encourage you to read it with a warm blanket and cup of hot chocolate in hand!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book! This young woman has such courage and &#34;grit&#34; that she will win your heart when you read her story!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing ending that will leave you for more!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Moving jay ready or not here I come. So excited about the movie
B00CAUHF6U|5.0|I started reading the first edition years ago but do not really recall much. This time I seem to remember it all. Am unbelievable tale, well told by an unbelievable man. This will become a history text book for all our children. Long live Madiba!
1616550414|2.0|I wanted this book for as long as its been out...<br /><br />But I bought from the wrong place. The book fell apart right when I got it. Advertised as new but it comes unwrapped.<br />There was a page missing.<br /><br />If you want this, buy it at a bookstore such as Barnes & Noble. Yes its $10 more there but its worth the additional $10.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|NO MORE CABLE bills, with this I have now cut my cable, other TV's had Netflix built in but had a couple TV's that were older, now no more cable bills and it works great
B00F0O8SZK|1.0|She sounds so morbid as she's singing. It was much too slow. Waste of money.<br />I won't be buying any more of her CDs
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I have down loaded many games like this but, it is refreshing that I don't have the special currency unless I want to.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Very suspenseful especially once you get pass the first couple of chapters. In the beginning I was very  confused. She introduced to many characters and I had a hard time telling them apart. But overall it was a good book....can't wait to read the rest in the series.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|and we loved this app cuz its the best app ever! (my version of The Best Song Ever by One Direction!)  I love this app its fun to play with for girls of all ages  the girls in here are really pretty and I just have fun! in long car rides I lisen to One Direction and play these games I absolutely LOVE Libbi<br />please buy this app
B005CM9DX6|1.0|I am a huge Opeth fan, and I wanted very badly to like this album.  Other reviews seem to suggest there is much nuance and interesting bits throughout, but the whole thing struck me as lackluster.  I honestly couldn't maintain sufficient focus to identify anything interesting on this album.  I played it all the way through, and then resolved to try again.  But I was so bored with it on the second try that I barely made it through the first couple of songs.  (I have to confess feeling much the same way about Damnation.)<br /><br />I can't begrudge Opeth for wanting to avoid being stuck in their death metal trappings, but this album just didn't appeal to my ears.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Wish they were all the same quality scary movies that isVery scary with realistic acting good actors script. Made me feel like I was in the story<br />The conjuring
B005XZHQKY|5.0|Beyond words. A magnificent treasure chest of aesthetically impressive High Definition. Can turn off the narrative and just relish this art while listening to GOOD music. It is amazingly therapeutic.
0375758992|5.0|Wonderful! I had a hard time putting it down. I love writers who can make me laugh out loud...and also cry. Very honest story... makes ME long for Africa too!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Who could ever think like the grim reaper? I read every day in the morning,then thought of it all day at work.I've never thought of the German person,in the war,just Nazis.this is a must read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is challenging and addictive! It also makes you want candy.  The only downside to it is when you run out of lives and have to wait to get them back
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun and entertaining. I am enjoying playing the game. I just wish I did not run out of lives so fast
1591840562|5.0|Great book! Covers lot of issues that can be major problems for any startup entrepreneur. Why learn the hard way when you can first read this book? I can easily validate that the author knows his business (based on my personal experience from two startups).
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of TD games. I bought the first kingdom rush and loved it. This one steps it up to a whole new level with upgradeable heros. The towers are greatly improved as well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Extremely moving, written so uniquely, deep and emotional, a completely new approach to a story that should never be forgotten. Beautiful. Thank you for the experience.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|L.I love it. I only wish you were able to hunt and earn more more glu coins also I would really enjoy some specials like crazy weapons
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A friend relentlessly kept inviting me to play so I broke down and downloaded the game. Now I can't stop playing. It's a nice brain challenge and fun to play with friends.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun for all ages, I enjoy it and so do my kids. I recommend for all who like building and creating there own world.  Good graphics, not generic looking.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was really really good. Anybody can read. It and they will fall in love in. Seconds it wa a great book
B00GH4R95C|2.0|Commits the worse sin a superhero movie could commit: It's obsolutely no FUN whatsoever. The actors are fine, the effects good, but there's no joy in Smallville.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The most intense exciting books I have ever read.  The games seem so real.  Fast reading because you want to read what happens next, I couldn't put it down.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|I really enjoyed learning about how Mike and Sulley got together, very good story line. I enjoyed how the teamwork senario for the &#34;loosing team&#34; worked out
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story that once you start is hard to put down! Keeps you guessing until the very end........and even after your done.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, of course I grew up watching Kaiju against Ultraman, Johnny Soko and His Giant Flying Robot and the Space Giants just to name a few. The imagery and feel of the movie was great.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I liked the fact that there was a beginning a middle and an end.  Very entertaining.<br />Can't wait to see season 2.
B00FHB7398|4.0|I did enjoy playing this game! Graphics were exceptional, and I liked the steampunk feel of the game. Story was good and spooky. But as with other reviewers, I found the touch screen interface to be problematic, especially in the HO scenes. They often just didn't respond, which made the game frustrating at times. Mini games were either too easy or you needed the guide to figure out what to do. This game had actual actors in it, and while this seemed a novelty at first, it quickly became tedious since they spoke their parts oh, so, slowly! It is really nice when a game includes a bonus chapter, which this one has. The game length is quite good plus the price is good. Big Fish has been lowering the prices for this type of game lately - something I really appreciate. The game is worth it, but I wish they would spend a little more time getting the interface right. Would have given it 5 stars if not for the problems, but then, I rarely give 5 stars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive.Do not start late if you have to get up early the next day.  Lots of fun, some of them really make you think
B00BD99JMW|2.0|With the total change in writing style, and lack of any excitement at all, this book was nothing like the can't-put-down the first two books were.  I waited for almost 2 years for this book, only to be very disappointed.  I will have to say that the book ended the only possible way it could to complete the story, and at least that made me happy.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|If you play music at all, any type, this is an excellent app.  Most popular songs are on there and it is easy to use and easy to read.  You can also sync it up to your computer (after setting up the account).

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While undeniably an emotional roller coaster, The Fault in Our Stars doesn't leave you feeling bleak and wounded and \\"why, oh why did I read this?!\\"  Weirdly, it is funny and encouraging, with-quite possibly-some of the most well written characters in literary history.  Yes, you will probably want to be alone with a box of tissues and a goodly supply of chocolate for the last 25% of the book, but worth it, dear reader.  Totally worth it.
B0089LOG02|3.0|This story was a roller coaster ride! it was sad and happy. Every page revealed another layer of Vivian's life. A great example if historical fiction!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a love story like nothing else I have read.  I couldn't put it down.
1476727651|5.0|I have read all of Stephen King's books... even the Dark Tower series.  It was a natural thing to have the same curiousity as he as to what happened to Danny Torrance after that horrifying winter at the Overlook.  You won't be disappointed here.  The story is a good one!  Without ruining any part of the story really, I will say as a reader I was a tinge disappointed in his using the name Frederica Bimmel in his story as though it was a name that had never been used before.  I immediately remembered Buffalo Bill saying &#34;Oh wait, isn't she a great big fat person?&#34; in Silence of the Lambs.  Granted, the name begs to be used for that of a not so fortunate girl, but to use it in a second story was kind of off for me.  I sure hope Stephen King never retires!  I hope to remain a constant reader of his as long as my eyes can see and ears can hear!
B00AW57L96|4.0|This is a well written story. Issues of conscience versus family values were probed, without judgement being made. A thought -provoking book.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Do I really need to explain?  Breaking Bad is one of the best things to happen to TV since.... The Wire.  Six Feet Under.  The Sopranos.  The Shield.  So much great story telling and acting and writing going on here that it's impossible to review, really.  And I am not the spoiling kind, so you won't get any reveals from me here!
B002IE2JF0|4.0|It was different view on an alien comes to earth.  And looks human. Had better technology of course.  Wasnt any stronger than a human. Of course the other alien looked way different.  Bigger, stronger of course. Ok movie to watch though...just once for me.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|This movie is a blast.  I am not even a marvel comic fan, but this movie was truly entertaining.  RDJ is again lightning quick with the wit and laser accurate in delivery.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays a character I've liked more than any of her other acting, really.  Good action here, peeps.
0399161287|5.0|Mike Tyson writes very honestly about his life and experiences.  You get an intimate understanding as to who he is.  I particularly enjoy how he does not try to re-write history  or gloss over his failings.  It was not as easy a read as I thought, but it is well worth the effort.

So much great story telling and acting and writing going on here that it's impossible to review, really.  And I am not the spoiling kind, so you won't get any reveals from me here!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Just a wonderful story about what is behind the &#34;face&#34; of a remarkable little boy!  Great book for children to adults!

B000FA5TTW|3.0|I wish I'd known before that it was inspired by a rape in the author's past. It might have made the whole thing a little cooler, in a sense -- a sort of eff you to the rapist. In any case, I just thought it was okay. More about the author's past here: [...]
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It is neither great nor terrible.  An ok read for a quiet afternoon by a nice toasty fire.  I like the epilogue the best
B008IJTFYW|4.0|The melodies help to quiet my thoughts.  It gets me to my sleep state much faster than when not using the melodies.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I think this book could have been so much better than it was. The writing (at times) was captivating. The descriptions were vivid and rich. However, I just didn't...get it.<br /><br />I cannot see people living in a silo which has a bazillion floors and no elevator. First of all, there are no silos big enough. Yes, this is sci-fi/dystopian but dang! At least make the setting halfway believable. Second, I never saw the point of the criminals having to clean the window-mirror things when they were cast out into the toxic world. Even when the author TRIED to explain it when the depressing sheriff was sent out, it made no sense.<br /><br />This book wasn't for me. Maybe if I took a chance on the second in the series, some questions I have would be answered. Honestly, I don't want to waste my money. I understand cliff-hangers and leaving the readers wanting more, but the first book has to at least make sense for me to read the second.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This works great!  I especially like that the night light can deem so it doesn't affect my ability to sleep soundly.  Also, now my husband doesn't have to ask me what time it is...he can see for himself.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is one of the best, in a cavalcade of great animated classics that Disney created. While the book itself was rather snarky and somewhat sarcastic, in the movie, Pinocchio was transformed from a sarcastic little brat into a creature who was often inveigled into large and costly errors because of his innocence. The fact that he didn't know any better was actually at times a saving grace as he and Jimminy Cricket found themselves in real danger, thanks to Honest John and his cohort, Gideon. Stromboli the  puppet-master lived up to his name as the thundering conniving man who had enslaved Pinocchio into his service, and the chubby, cheerful, Coachman was a truly terrifying being that used the power of an island to turn bad boys into donkeys for profit, a clear warning that the face of evil isn't always an unpleasant one. Seeing the unfortunate Lampwick turning into a donkey was and still is a terrifying sight to this day as was the final confrontation Pinocchio had with Monstro the Whale, a huge creature capable of swallowing whole ships, in order to rescue his father, who had been looking for him, giving his all to become a real boy.  This is one of the true gems in classic animation, and one not to be missed.....
B004GYY714|5.0|I love TuneIn Radio.  It is accessible to at all times, as I can access it through my Kindle Fire.  I can search for the genre of music that I want at any time.
B00447L4KA|4.0|I have always been a Heath Ledger fan, and it was truly a tragedy when he passed. This is a great flick, when you are locked in on a rainy day!
006202406X|5.0|I'm surprised at some of the negative comments on the final book and ending. While it was emotionally draining, and upsetting, it was provocative, raw, and honest. Did anyone think the outcome should be any different? Those who don't like the last book are feel good junkies who need a &#34;hollywood&#34; ending and want their emotions resolved and to feel satisfied and good...but that's not the real world, and not the world of  Divergent either. I did struggle a bit with the concept of the &#34;experiment&#34; as the resolution for the &#34;damage&#34;, as it seemed a bit illogical...even so I loved it...and can't wait to see the movie, which I hope does the book justice!
0800141601|5.0|i've always been a Richard Gere fan and Sean Connery isn't that bad either. This is a movie I could watch over and over. It is set back in the time of Camelot....and it is 2 wonderful men fighting for the love of one woman.

0739315293|5.0|Bill Bryson's narration of this fascinating study of the seminally important events  in the (extended) summer of  1927, brings covers events in politics, inventions, economics, sports, crime, inventions, business which impacted not only America's future but the world. He deftly covers some background material and seamly flows into his current topic and then carries the story forward. It's a fun and educational read, often a real page turner, and well recommended.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was deeply moving and john green clearly has the ability to see through people's minds and understand, express it. The book was moving, funny, romantic at bits and very very deep.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|At first it was, hey this is pretty good stuff...  Now it's just their best!!!  Part of it could be that<br />they are able to make it more dynamic and it really is but bottom line is this is one great album!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Once you read this book you will never want to eat grains again !!  It's a little boring in the beginning but once you really und e strand what Dr.Davis is saying you won't want to live any other way. His recipes are really great too in the cookbook. I DON'T feel bloated at all when I stay away from wheat.
B008JFUS5A|4.0|If Katniss thought that her nightmare was over, she learns that she was dead wrong in Catching Fire.<br /><br />As it begins, we find her suffering from PTSD, with her best pal verging on boyfriend Gale, who cared for her mother and kid sister through her ordeal, none too happy about her connection to Peeta and the fact that the ruse they used to win the Game will need to be maintained for life for obvious reasons.  How to deal with that issue, and that for poor Peeta it wasn't an act, is unfortunately the least of her problems.  Intentionally or not, Katniss has become the face of the resistance, and President Snow feels that she has to be neutralized.<br /><br />The fact that the next Game is going to be a \\"Quarter Quell\\", meaning a special event which occurs every twenty five years and for which the rules are altered for the occasion, gives Snow an opening.  He declares that the next reaping will consist of past victors - forcing Katniss into automatic competition as the only surviving female victor of her district.  Peeta immediately volunteers as their district's male Tribute, angling to both support Katniss and spare their mentor Haymitch from participation in one shot.  So it is that they both descend into hell again, facing other Tributes who are no novices but have also managed to outlast 23 other contestants in at least one previous Game.<br /><br />The veterans will naturally have a number of brutal Career Tributes among them, but there are also a number of competitors with whom Katniss and Peeta may be able to do business.  Among the more relatively humane contestants whom they put on their potential ally shortlist are Finnick, a Twentysomething who was the Game's youngest victor in his teens; Finnick's former mentor Mags, a mute Octogenarian who nobly offered herself in place of Finnick's mentally traumatized girlfriend Annie; techno-geeks Beetee and Wiress, who won their respective games on brainpower; and Johanna, a loose cannon who seems to be aroundKatniss' age and isn't afraid to say exactly what she thinks about Snow and the Capitol.<br /><br />Moral dilemmas abound.  Do Katniss and Peeta throw in with some folks who might have fewer skills to offer but might be less likely to stab them in the back?  What happens if and when the point comes that the Career Tributes are gone and they're dealing with inevitably having to kill other Tributes who are also fighting only to keep their loved ones from being tortured and/or killed?  We're also given a glimpse of the struggles some of the others are facing.  Particularly poignant is Finnick's effort to keep Mags with him in spite of the painfully obvious long odds of her lasting through the tournament at her age.  These are people who in some cases deserve to live as much as Katniss and Peeta.<br /><br />Ending with a pitch black cliffhanger, Catching Fire will only further pull in fans of the first movie, and leave them awaiting the next installment with dread anticipation.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|did not like this because it locked up on me and woulf come up each time i went on face book. .............
006202406X|4.0|Absolutely loved every moment of reading this book, apart from the end. I hated the end. Fortunately, I found a better ending on fanfiction.net so I'm happy :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions because they are so cute and adorable.<br />This game is super nice and cool it is also addicting..
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|I wanted to hate this movie, I really did.  But I ended up liking it.<br /><br />I saw the Chris Reeve movies at the theaters and was a big fan of them.  I loved the first and second ones and when the Richard Donner cut was released on Blu Ray for Superman 2 I purchased it and thought it was the better version.  (Movies 3 and 4  are better forgotten. Maybe they took place in a parallel dimension.)<br /><br />I thought Superman Returns was OK but like so many others have stated it seemed to lack something.  Superman never seemed to get emotional or punch anything but spent too much time stalking Lois Lane.<br /><br />In the C. R. versions Brando was Jorel, hard to top that.  But I have to say that Superman's Kryptonian and adoptive earth parents were well played in this feature.<br /><br />Much have been said about the over-the-top destruction in Metropolis and (spoiler alert) Superman's breaking his code against killing.  There have been some tweaking of the traditional Superman story points.  But the basics of the mythology is still there.<br /><br />Superman has become a story that has been recreated time and again for new generations, as such the story evolves to become more relevant.<br /><br />I especially liked the part where Zod was overwhelmed by sights and sounds from his evolving super-powers.  It is the same thing that happened with Brainiac in Superman Unbound.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and look forward to the Superman-Batman movie to be released.
B000G03RJA|5.0|If your looking for an essential Laura Branigan CD this is the one to own. Has all of her hits and hard to find tracks. Hopefully one day we'll get an box set of her work. One of the best female vocalists of the 80's and 90's. It's truly sad that she isn't more popular.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|NIce that her name truly reflects her vocal power. I am sure the decision to use that last name was a consideration.  Very nice debut with a very delectable assortment of upbeats tracks that uplift and keep you looking forward to the next.  She is definitely one to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Dispicable me is a great game, its just like temple run but better. This game has different locations and different minions to play ; there is no excuse not to get this game because the best thing about it is that its FREE!! So that's why you need to get this game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so happy I can get candy crush on my kindle! so addictive!!! love teasing my brain to figure out the goals in each level and the Colorado are awesome!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|This is probably the most difficult movie for me to rate in a while. I love Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Thor and pretty much the whole comic-to-movie scene. It's great to see characters brought to life but sometimes the stories are bad or the movie fails to entertain. This movie suffers from neither of those but I was just as frustrated as I was entertained because this storyline strays so far from how the Superman story was originally told that it was unsettling. Top that off with typical production oversights and it affects the quality of the movie<br /><br />For example, one &#34;roll your eyes&#34; moment is when Superman and Zod (who only moments ago learned to fly) clinch together and punch each other into space, they &#34;land&#34; on a satellite (what are the chances of that?), then re-clinch as they plummet back to Earth--by coincidence, right back to the middle of Metropolis. They crash through the roof of what looks like Grand Central Station and continue fighting. Ten seconds later Lois Lane who was watching them fight (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN) as they blasted off into space, comes running through the front door to continue watching. How did she get across town in ten seconds? Great taxis I suppose. The movie is filled with moments like that. A shame.<br /><br />Also Jonathan Kent dies of a heart attack everywhere else. Here, he has a son who is invulnerable and has super speed, nevertheless he dies horribly trying to save a dog while his son--Superman!--stands idly by and watches. I rolled my eyes so hard they almost popped out of their sockets.<br /><br />The rest I will leave to you to discover but I will say this. First, the movie is entertaining. If you've never seen a Superman movie before or know the basic story you may like it more than I did. Since the comic-to-movie genre is so successful, I don't see why Marvel and DC sell the rights to companies that want to change the story so much. This made sense 30 years ago, but now?  If they stuck totheir guns, they'd still sell the rights...to someone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Could not drop this book until it was over!<br />Captivating storyline and characters with a breath taking pace that keeps the heart thumping all the way.
0140072187|5.0|This is best book written from Vietnam  Pilots point of view.  Book must be archived for future generation.<br />I would very highly recommend this book.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Doesn't take long for energy to recharge. Easy to play with lots of mini games.
B007JZW3VS|4.0|Prophetic, evocative with a writing style voice of the 1930s.  Intriguing overlays of themes allow the reader to explore endless possibility about the characters.  What really, truly motivates them and underpins them as human beings.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I wanted to like this book, by  it just never captured me.  The book is fairly well written, yet boring.  While waiting for something to happen, the book ended.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Well written through close collaboration between Malala and her co-author this provides a fascinating view of growing up in the Swat as well as a powerful and often poignant  tale of living under the ignorance and brutality of the Taliban.<br /><br />The biography of a brave and now powerful young lady and insights into worlds formerly seen mostly through reporters eyes. If you have any interest in what is going on in that area of the world, read this book.

B00D6SBOWG|3.0|Is a little confusing and unclear as far as how the different clubs work and when to use them. The only explanation is in the &#34;putt around&#34; learning course. Can't figure out where to look &#34;how to&#34; info.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love these kinds of games! They are very simple, yet tons of fun! I read another review saying this game was not compatible on earlier versions of the Kindle Fire, so I was worried,  but even though I own an earlier version, it has been working just fine for me. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who likes games like farmville, the Simpson's tapped out, etc. It is something to do when you're bored!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The one word I can think of is brilliant...well, also amazing, engaging, mesmerizing, fantastically well written and over one of the best books I have ever read.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is my third edition of this style game controller from Logitech. I am a little clumsy with the keyboard since my arthritis started getting worse and this controller helps me out with that and gives me an edge in games. Even before that was a problem, I have very small hands and it helps keep my fingers on the right keys. No problems with any of them other than the back light stopped working on the last one. I love the style and layout. The small joystick is a little tricky when I use it, but I think it is a case of just getting use to it.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|Description says &quot;play from any device&quot;  but kindle is apparently not included. You can't link to your account via FB as you can with other devices, so you're pretty much stuck with just the Kindle. Of course, you don't find out until the half gig app downloads, and you go through a ridiculous forced intro, setting up a new robot v and all, which is a complete waste of time if you already have an account on a different device. All in all, it seems like a cool game, good graphics, fun game play, interesting robots and upgrades, but it's excessively monetized--you have to buy EVERYTHING.Add that to the hassle  of setting up an acct on two devices, and I just don't know if it's worth it for me. It seems like a lame attempt to make money with flashy graphics without consideration for functionality. Sadly, kindle users always seem to get ignored with these kinds of things.
0061726834|3.0|Like most other reviewers, I agree that Lauren Olivier has a clear way with words.  She describes the environments effortlessly, in a way that you can fully capture the image described and the emotions garnered.  I found the world building and general thesis of the story to be clever and well-written, but somewhere past the first few chapters I started to become bored.  There isn't much action, which is okay, it's not the Hunger Games, but she doesn't make up for that lack of excitement with engaging characters or dialogue.  Instead, we are treated to the day to day boredom of Lena's life, even including her time after meeting Alex.  It's not overly romantic or swoony, so I found their interaction to be shallow.  Oliver has written to please the YA fans.  She has an interesting concept, and no follow through, which seems to be the norm.  Some readers will accept this because the formulaic plot is similar enough to other popular books.  They can substitute themselves with Lena and Alex with their current crush, and suddenly the book is a winner.<br /><br />I haven't read the other books in the series.  I don't plan to.  This book didn't hook me enough to be interested in what happens next.  I've also read the synopsis of Lauren Oliver's new book...now this one sounds just like the Hunger Games.  Her works lead me to believe she has talent, but no creativity.  She can write the words, but not come up with a good enough story.  This new book could have taken her in a brand new direction, steered away from cloning popular YA, but it doesn't look like she is doing that.  I could be wrong - this book could be the opposite of what I imagine it to be.  If so, I will be happy to read it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I absolutely enjoy this game. It is so much fun!! I look forward to my daily hunt.  I love it.!.!.!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Slow burn , old fashioned , haunted house , frightened family in peril picture , is a very soft R with NO tongue in cheek missteps . Add in a great cast featuring Patrick Wilson , Vera Farmiga , Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston and you've got that rare bird . The film starts and ends with a very solid script and excellent character development . Buy in .
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|A movie is a movie! not sure why I should rate a simple DVD but it is Star Trek so I could rate it 5 :)
B00GO95TAC|1.0|Bleah-got halfway thru the Day of the Doctor and now I am just getting the spinning blue wheel of death! Plus-stupid Amazon has charged me twice so far to watch this show. I guess that's better than the $15 I would have spent tomorrow night in the theater, but it still stinks. What I have watched has been interesting and I would love to see the end, but I guess this show is like driving down a virtual tollway-If I don't pay for every 30 minutes, I don't get to get to the end.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book started off rather slow and I had a hard time getting into it, however, once it got running I couldn't put it down!!  Had to jump right into the Mockingjay!!
1451666179|5.0|The honesty and authentic storytelling makes this one of my favorite books by far. Though the formatting of some strips has changed along with some illustrations, it still translates well to book form.

6305428042|5.0|A must for every Halloween. The best witch story, and one the whole family can enjoy. Hell, not even just the family. I'm single, no kids, and all of my friends came over just to watch this movie this past Halloween.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game<br />Wonderfully fun and entertaining for me and my family<br />Would recommend to anyone<br />Plus it challenges us on every level
B00BESCJII|4.0|This is a much better than average film version of a wildly popular book. Emma Watson brings surprising depth to her role as does Ezra Klein.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Crafty story, bad ending.<br />Didn't like the language but I had to keep reading to see how it ended.  Should have put it down.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Not much to add to the hundreds of reviews already posted about this book. It is well written and quite powerful and I'd submit that the reason it was so popular internationally is that there are so many themes that are common to the vast majority of teenagers these days. Bullying, sex, drugs, music, books, wonder, suicides, and yes mental illness. All of those themes are commonly associated with cliches yet the book manages to avoid that. You realize early on that something isn't quite right with, Charlie your narrator, yet his straightforward observances ring true. The end result of an ultimately satisfying and uplifting contrivance and I think you could give it to a child at 15 or 16 - the book is over a decade old and nothing has really changed, it just seems to have become more fierce.<br /><br />That said, it reminds me of Douglas Coupland's &#34;Girlfriend in a Coma&#34; which is a better read. Broader in scope, ranging well into adulthood and straight into the the fantastic...
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I do enjoy the take on this movie, although I do not believe it, it is well crafted. Shakespeare did write his own material and I have studied enough to remain consistent in this belief although this film is exceptionally well done.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We saw this on Prime and enjoyed it so much that we bought the DVD to have.  You need to watch it if you haven't already!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I was disappointed that I could not use this program offline. I read that it could be used offline and another that said it could not be used except online. I decided that I would take a chance in hopes that it could be used offline. If there is a posibility that it can be used offline, I would like to know how I can do it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It's nice to see Grisham has returned to his traditional characters and story plots. Well written and reminiscent of Faulkner writing about the Deep South, fans of Grisham's &#34;old school&#34; style will enjoy this return to Clanton and its humble but favored attorney Jake Brigance.

1587613379|2.0|I write this review as someone who is extremely sympathetic to polyamory, has explored it in the past, and has made the choice that it is not something that would be ultimately as satisfying for me as monogamy.<br /><br />I am delighted with certain aspects of the book that reframe abundant sexual expression in positive ways, promote honest, authentic, and safe relationships, and encourage people to explore with openness what is true for them.  I also enjoy the \\"workbook\\" like nature of many of the inquiries, allowing many people to really make these ideas concrete in their own lives.<br /><br />However, even upon re-reading this 2nd edition, I fundamentally disagree with too many of the underlying premises and the underlying energy of defensiveness throughout the book.  Foremost is the underlying premise that monogamy isn't anything special, and that you can essential do everything you can do in monogamy with polyamory.  The authors suggest quite explicitly in several places that monogamy is simply a more sexually repressed, unenlightened, and outdated version of a more supposedly spiritually mature polyamory.  I find their arguments utterly unconvincing, overly simplistic, defensive, and often overstated.<br /><br />I maintain that monogamy and polyamory are qualitatively different and should not be compared as if they were better or lesser versions of the same thing.  They are both beautiful, both unique, and there is something special about both of them.  They present qualitatively different challenges that are not the same.  Monogamy inviting challenges that can ONLY come from unconditionally committing to be sexually exclusive with one person.  Polyamory invites challenges that can ONLY come from unconditionally being open to letting love and sexual exploration flow as they arise.  A truly non-biased book on polyamory would address both of these things as if they were equally beautiful, not as if one was better than the other.<br /><br />Also, it would have struck me as more balanced to give some credence to the idea that some people do indeed explore polyamory as a means to escape when confronting their edges, out of fear of commitment or 'abandonment', or other choices that don't come from love.  I would have liked to have seen a process to help people tell the difference between moving towards polyamory out of fear vs. because it is truly aligned for us.  Our authors seem to suggest fairly consistently that any foray into polyamory is a step in the direction of greater love and sexual expression whereas my own exploration and so too those of many of my friends suggest that this is not always (or often) the case.<br /><br />There are also ideas in the book which strike me as simply incorrect or inconsistent  For example: the authors seem to be thoroughly convinced in \\"the more is better attitude\\" equating more sexual partners with notions of sexual abundance.  They write that they see no benefit in restriction or abstinence.  Yet they paradoxically also seem to promote healthy boundaries.  I see this as inconsistent.  Every ancient spiritual tradition that I know of (from tantra to taoism) that is sex positive has highly developed practices of sexual abstinence that increase the intensity, pleasure, and intimacy among sexual partners when they do occur.  To not see any role for abstinence and restriction in sexual empowerment strikes me as adolescent and a really dangerous proposal for those who truly value self-connection and self-realization.<br /><br />Restriction and abstinence are not forms of repression if they arise from a clear discernment about we we want.  Furthermore what is common to both monogamy and polyamory is the willingness to redirect all of our energy, all of our sexuality towards where it will flower most in the world.  A monogamist does this with one person.  A polyamorist with many.  I don't see any need to bash monogamy to promote polyamory.

B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Started off fairly strong...and then just died.  The beginning of Dr. Sleep was tinged with vintage creepy King. But, then cometh the middle...and boy did it lag. The end was such a let down....the \\"monsters\\" didn't even die good, convincing deaths. Mr. King is an awesome talent, but this isn't one of his best...feels like it was forced, an afterthought. This book cannot be compared to its predecessor, The Shining, which is a modern horror masterpiece.

B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Fantastic movie, will watch it again and again. If you like Deniro and Pesci, you  will be in love with their performance.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Once again, Helen Fielding has done it!! Bridget Jones is funny, irreverent and believable!! I laughed so hard in some places that I cried! The book is such a poignant, yet hopeful, fast paced rendering of the struggles of widowhood, raising young children and the difficulty of combining parenthood, work, and finding love again. A great read!
0393327655|3.0|This is indeed a fine book.  What I expected, however, was a book about religion.  Well, it is, up to a point.  Most of the book is a fairly heavy philosophical treatise on ethics, going chapters at a time without even mentioning religion (that may be an exaggeration,but that's what it felt like reading it).  Reading this book was like expecting ice cream and getting yogurt instead.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Oh man this made me smile so much seeing that her CD didn't have a single 3, 2, or 1 star!!! This is as it should be!! I LOVE LINDSEY STIRLING'S MUSIC!!!!! I went on YouTube and looked up all her music videos and I was grinning from ear to ear during every single one! I cannot say enough how much I love this girl. She plays like a master, she is obviously passionate about her beautiful music, and she is such a lovely person. This CD is AMAZING. Why are you wasting time reading reviews?! BUY THIS CD!!! If you aren't sure you want it, just look up her vids on YouTube and you'll come right back here and buy it! That's exactly what I did! Her violin has been touched by the Master's hand. 'Nuff said.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This one was not as good as the first.  It felt a little long and drug out to us.  It's worth watching, just wasn't as engaging as the first season.  Felt like they tried to out do themselves and season 1.  We thought it was a little too dark and too twisted, I am sure that will appeal to a lot of people though.
0060589469|1.0|This book is totally a waste of time. I am no expert in philosophy (though always interested), my work is connected to the mathematical and physical aspects of those of Poincare. I am raged to find out so many incorrect, empty and misleading arguments in this book. I doubt that the author did understand the mathematical contents of Poincare's work before giving away his hand-waving philosophy judgement and conclusions. Please do not waste time on this piece.

031603438X|3.0|Direct from the horses mouth, somewhat disjointed and rambling in parts and not over illuminating to the premises that are brought up, and then not explored. Would probably sum up a life engaged in self indulgent abuse pretty well, strictly for Keef fans only.

0670024856|1.0|I am almost half way through this tedious, boring and somewhat depressing story.  I have just now combed through the reviews to glean some reason I might finish it.  Although the very ending may provide some enlightenment as to why I'm trudging through this, I just CAN'T DO IT.  Loved Eat Pray Love, and was hoping to enjoy an engaging novel by the same author.

B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Leckie's Ancillary Justice grabs you by the scruff of the neck and gives you a good shake until all your preconceptions of perspective, gender, humanity, good and evil fall out on the floor. For days after you'll find your self still examining the pieces. This smart, thoughtful novel is told from the first person perspective of an AI who is both one entity and hundreds of individual ancillary persons. If that's not enough to boggle your mind, then the AI's use of a language that ignores gender will. The story challenges the very language structure upon which we hang our thoughts and our assumptions about justice, motivation, free will, and sanity. What is the true price of civilization? Is there ever a clear right and wrong or are we always choosing among the lessor of several evils? These are just my initial thoughts about the book! The story is still knocking around in my brain. I can't wait to read it again, yet there is also some trepidation. The reader has to interpret and interact with the story. You watch yourself think through it, then exam why you thought about it in such a fashion. Ancillary Justice is a fascinating novel written by an author at the top of her game. It is not to be missed and you will not be disappointed.
B00C1MLHRA|1.0|Fell for this hook,line and sinker.  2.0 DTS Master Audio?  I've been waiting for a Supertramp recording in a multi-channel format and didn't even realize DTS MA was available in 2.0.  My iTunes download sounds better than this!  Very disappointed!
B00GQ7OZR0|5.0|I always fear being disappointed with new season's and this being #8, I wonder if writers are running out of material. But so far (I've only watched 1st 4 episodes) I've not been disappointed.
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|Very good read; spot on - I should give it as Christmas Presents...<br />Oh, they want seven more words -
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Note: This review contains SPOILERS.<br /><br />As someone who discovered Doctor Who with the 2005 revival series, I have greatly enjoyed all 7 (so far) seasons and all 3 (again, so far) incarnations of the Doctor.  And I've slowly been working my way backwards in time to catch up with the \\"classic\\" era episodes on DVD.  I've bought plenty of books and collectibles as well.  I am a fan.<br /><br />So, like all fans, I was very excited about this highly-touted 50th anniversary episode, which sees, among other things, the return of 10th Doctor David Tennant.  And I will say right here and now that Tennant's interactions with 11th Doctor Matt Smith are among the best parts of the episode.  The episode has a very cinematic feel to it, and I regret not taking advantage of the opportunity to see it (in 3-D, no less) on the big screen.  It looks fantastic, and the main story is very engaging.<br /><br />On the downside, I was quite disappointed that Billie Piper was only playing a sort of Rose Tyler avatar, not the real character.  There is really no reason for her to be there (the character even admits she has appeared to the wrong Doctor, but never changes her appearance).  And although John Hurt is a fine actor and does his best with the material, I never really felt that his character was as dark as the 11th Doctor indicated at the end of the previous episode.<br /><br />And even with one delightful cameo, I still feel there were some missed opportunities here.  It IS a good story, and one that's important to the show's overall mythology.  But it needed to be bigger, with more guest stars.  It needed to be an EVENT, and I just feel it fell short of that ambition.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm a fan.  And I'll definitely be buying this.  I look forward to seeing it in 3-D.  And maybe I'll like it more the second time around. . .we'll see.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've just viewed the 3-D Blu-ray, and I am happy to raise my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  While I do stand by my comments above, watching the episode in 3-D really made for a much richer experience.  On the technical side, it's as good as any 3-D theatrical release I've viewed on my home screen.  The early scene with the TARDIS being lifted by helicopter over London is breathtaking, as are the panoramic views of old England with the 10th Doctor and Elizabeth I.  Since the show itself went to high definition in 2009, it has been among the most visually-striking programs in production.  \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" raises the bar even higher.<br /><br />The disc also contains a 13-minute \\"making of\\" featurette, narrated by 6th Doctor Colin Baker.  Make sure you watch the episode first, though, as the special does give away some major plot points.  There are also a handful of delete scenes (nothing earth-shaking), two trailers, and a nice overview of the series in general.  This last feature is basically another, longer (46 min.) episode of the \\"Doctor Who Revisited\\" series.<br /><br />If you have the equipment, and are a Doctor Who fan, this is absolute must-have.  More than anything, it really made me wish ALL future episodes of the show could be in 3-D.nts above, watching the episode in 3-D really made for a much richer experience.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I love this cooler, I have used it on AMD and Intel CPUs, the universal, adjustable mounting is easy to work with.<br /><br />And the cooling is amazing. plenty of surface area to dissipate heat, it blows stock fans away. (pun intended)<br /><br />The ability to add a second fan is nice, but I haven't needed it, I've been able to line it up with a case fan behind it for maximum airflow through the cooler and out the case.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Nice and convenient, plus easy to use. A good choice to download and does a nice job clearing up space.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I love this movie and cannot wait for the BluRay to come out.  Cinematography is great.  I have one problem with the ending.<br /><br />There is none.  We learn so much about Sandra Bullocks' character and then they dump her on the beach and that's it!  No way!<br /><br />If they had done that in Castaway with Tom Hanks the crowd would have been screaming at the studio.<br /><br />Maybe there is Gravity 2, but with our current space program that is not getting off the ground either.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This is a basic &#34;Heroes Journey&#34; story that continues M.Night's theme of humans out of balance with our own environment.  From the microcosm of the nuclear family to the major systems of the Earth that some call Gaia, the lack of harmony within and without cause catabolic consequences.<br /><br />The demeaning of  M.Night's work is a mystery to me.  It resonates for me in the changing climate we're experiencing.  MN's work suggests our hand in this outcome.  As if we had become the virus attacking the planet and Earth finding ways to heal itself.<br /><br />In this sense, humans are not the clear hero as we destroy that which sustains us, our family structure, our air, and continue to prepare for battle out of the fear of....self-imagined and imposed pressures.<br /><br />MN's work is ambitious and insightful.  Even while falling short of some folk's expectations, it deserves an audience and our support.

B00G4I1CLS|4.0|I finally finished the movie. I couldn't get through it the first time because this is a very hard to watch and take it all in. I am probably the biggest fan of killer whales out there. Watching this helped to open my eyes to the fact that SeaWorld is a business that is out to make money and be successful. But another thing to think about, a majority of the whales in captivity now were born in captivity or have been in captivity for over 20 years. They just can't be thrown out in the wild when they haven't been exposed to predators or haven't been taught how to catch prey. That is almost as bad as keeping them in captivity. My personal opinion is to stop the breeding of the killer whales in captivity. Let those that are alive continue to live out their years. Because, as humans, we got them into this and we can't just make this problem go away. The only real issue is that SeaWorld the corporation isn't going to stop the breeding because they are making money. But, another thing is that people on here are blaming all of SeaWorld, when its only the political and corporate side that is the problem. I have seen first hand the care and safety for these animals and the trainers. All the trainers at SeaWorld know the risk of their jobs and know that they are putting their life on the line every time they get in the water. But the trainers don't care, if they didn't love their job and these animals, they wouldn't do it. Nobody is making these trainers get in the water with the killer whales, its purely voluntary. I have personal spoke with some killer whales trainers and they all say that they wouldn't change their job for anything. Since the accident with Dawn, the trainers aren't even allowed in the water with the killer whales and the trainers hate it. These animals are the most beautiful and majestic animals that live on this Earth. They have a social obligation that far exceeds that of the human kind. If you think about it, the whales are more advanced than we are, they stick with their families their whole lives, looking out for each other. As humans, it is normal for a child to leave their parents and family at the age of 18 to pursue their life's interest. I feel that most heart breaking thing for me to see was when they we showing the footage from the 80's about capturing the baby killer whales, and when they would move the babies away from their mother and their mothers would grieve and cry out of them. I also became angry when I found out that the whales that we found dead in the nets were filled with rocks and were sunk to the bottom of the ocean. That was just so hard to hear. We as the public need to watch this movie to find out the truth behind what is really going on. And I believe that Tilikum is not a killer!!! He has been through a lot and most of his aggression and frustration comes from what he learned and experienced at a young age. Another thing that upset me was the facts about SeaLand! It was just sad and completely disappointing!!! This movie is a huge eye opener and should be watched by many people.

0061537969|5.0|What a lovely book. A friend loaned me a copy after my beloved Corgi died, and I can't imagine anything more comforting than this book. When a friend's dog died, I sent him a copy. He read it from start to finish in one session and said the same thing. I then bought ten more copies. I sent some to dog-loving friends, and I kept a couple on hand so I can give them to people in the future.<br /><br />Don't get the impression that this is philosophy, or that it's morbid. It's a charming story and an easy read. There were times when it made me laugh aloud. But it's full of soul. I know I will read it again.<br /><br />If you have lost a beloved dog, or if you have an aging dog, you owe it to yourself to read this. If you have a friend who has lost a dog, this is the perfect gift.<br /><br />Trust me on this - I am not affiliated with Garth Stein and couldn't pick the man out of a line-up. It's just that good.

B0053B347M|4.0|Lights are bright. As others have mentioned, the adhesive on the strip isn't the best. It was good enough that I could remove it(I put the power cord on the wrong side of the monitor) and reapply it without any trouble. However, the edges tend to not stick, which decreases the light on the sides of the monitor.<br />I actually think the USB power cord is suitably long, I have it plugged into an AC adapter on a power strip.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Wow - what a waste.<br /><br />About 15 minutes if good story and action and the rest is two men if steel fighting each other (and how does one kill the other when they are men of steel?).<br /><br />Plus they destroyed a city and town in the fighting, so I am sure the people of America are thrilled with the new Superman!<br /><br />This was just dumb.

B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I think most of these reviews were good, but most failed to see the point of H.M&#62; The Queen seeing the beautiful stag at Balmoral. She looks at the deer and says out loud &#34;You Beauty!&#34; She is in awe of the stag and tries to scare it away from the hunters. As soon as she hears it has been shot, she jumps into her Land Rover to go and see it! She later sees it hanging, decapitated,butchered, and she cries. She saw in the stag what the British saw in Diana! The Queen had more feelings for a dead stag than her x-daughter in law!

B00GO95TAC|5.0|I am giving the SHOW five stars because I loved this episode! As far as I am concerned it delivered big time! I have one minor quibble with the end but I understand why they did what they did, so okay I won't complain. I also won't say more about that because I don't want spoilers. If you are a fan, WATCH this, HOWEVER...<br />If you can find it somewhere else, watch it there. I paid $7.99 and the playback was glitchy in a number of spots. I won't say shame on Amazon for the price as others have done - I was willing to pay, and show-wise, I got my money's worth. I am ticked off a bit about the glitchy playback though. I will email Amazon about it and see what they have to say.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The cancellation of this show to this day baffles its devotees!  Joss Whedon at his finest with a great ensemble of actors weaving in drama and romance and adventure that surpasses Star Trek in my opinion and does so while fulfilling the niche of a space cowboy movie as nothing before or since.  Imagine a world in which Han Solo would be at home rather than an aberration in a movie series that was certainly fun (Star Wars) but full of stereotypical characters and plot development.  FIrefly revels in stereotypes, it loves them and leverages them to comedic advantage while causing the audience to find themselves living in the FIrefly world and loving it!  Nathan Fillion has no doubt brought in tons of green playing the lead in Castle, a series where references to Firefly are injected.  In a tribute to Firefly, Adam Baldwin makes a cameo in Castle in which HE is the guy who pushes Nathan Fillion around in a kind of role reversal.  Gina Torres has a great gig with Suits.  But no matter what roles the main characters are playing now, I believe they would all still come back to make a season two of Firefly.  The cast, the creator and the fans are holding out faint hope to this day!

I have been studying all types of programs and authors that teach &#34;manifesting&#34; in the past 15 years and have spent lots of money,  This book is the best and hands down the easiest to read and for the first time - it resonated perfectly with me!!!  I just &#34;got it&#34;.  I actually read this again every few months just to remind me that my world is truly in my hands and I have complete control over EVERYTHING!!  I am so grateful for Pam for sharing this with the world.  I can't recommend it enough!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Feel like a kid again. Great app. Runs smoothly no problems after playing many many times. Easy to restart game and pick up on level you left off at.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love playing this game!  My daughter and I play this together. We are  horse lovers and we are unable to have one so this gives us a horse to<br />take care of.
1594204217|5.0|I love food so this was something I had to read. My first food book was purchased at Culinary Institute in Hyde Park, NY - a History of food. This is similar except it focuses on cooking methods, and how each major breakthrough may have contributed to the evolution of humans. From fire, to using clay pottery (for making stews and broths previously impossible to do), etc. Great read for any food fanatic.
1591391105|5.0|I actually listened to the version on CD. This was a fantastic read. I specifically got it for a new job where I had coordinator responsibilities and issues dealing with managing up and this was incredibly helpful. I highly recommend it for anyone starting a new job.
B00E8TVHBA|1.0|this movie sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!! the story line is the stupidest thing ever!!!!!!!!!! the acting pathetic!!!!! I cant believe I just wasted an hour and 30 minutes of my life I will never get back on this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CDTSQZW|1.0|Whats with the region restrictions? So I pay $50 for a bluray and can't even play it. And they wonder why people use Torrents. I'm not buying a new region free player just to watch this when every thing else from amazon I have purchased works fine. Guess I will just download it anyway. As for the series, (I have seen it 3 times) I can't get enough of it. Brilliant.<br /><br />P.s Regions restrictions should have ended with DVDs.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|This is actually a lot of fun. It gets progressively more difficult as you play so it will be enjoyable for all levels of players.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Great seeing the story of the Eagles from the beginning.  Actually Glen Frey's and Don Henley's start. As an old guy, I loved seeing Linda Ronstadt and her role in the Eagles.<br />Haven't watched the concert yet.<br />And explains their issues with Don Felder.
0321934318|5.0|The author adds a bit of humor to a potentially dry topic to keep it interesting. The author is extremely knowledgeable about the software. There is lots to learn to put this software to its full capability, and this book should help you get the most out of it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|it does what it said work great. I have told everyone I know to get it, very easy to use .You cant go wrong
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Best epic read I had, in the same league as game of thrones but with more magic going around.<br />Must read for any fantasy adict
0374533571|3.0|As someone who grew up in South Jersey and travelled to Philly on a weekly basis, this story struck a homey, familiar chord and was immediately endeared to me.<br />The images of sadness and depression and losing touch with reality make it an emotionally touching story, but Pat's childish inner monologue got on my nerves until the very end, even after it's suggested he might be living a sort of second childhood after his mental break.<br />It's kind of like Girl, Interrupted but with football. And racist caricatures of black people. Black person, I should say. The one black character has an Afro and was a &#34;gangsta rapper&#34; and says things like 'Bros b4 hos'.<br />I've had the book forever, and loved the movie, so I figured I might as well give the book a try. But while I don't feel like I wasted my time reading this, I could have done without.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for fans of the movie and anyone else who enjoys a quality reflex tester. You can tell that more love and care went into this game than most games based on movies. It gets a five star rating because i feel  like im not constantly pressured to make in app purchases. Anyone can enjoy.
0307887448|3.0|I used to read books in which the authors skimmed over tiny details and stuck to the bigger picture and I'd think 'Man, I wish I knew so much more about this character's life.' And then I read Ready Player One. I will never wish for more detail again.<br /><br />All the minutiae about showering and security doors and suits and furniture and masturbation tools and exercise equipment and virtual items up for auction was exhausting. I found myself skimming over every few paragraphs in several areas of the thing because I just got so fed up with all that filler that absolutely did not advance the plot in any way.<br /><br />I did like the story, though. I appreciate the imagination of the writer and his obvious enthusiasm for science fiction and technology, and I'd definitely give this another go if it were re-edited with a mind toward streamlining. There's practically an entire second novel's worth of extraneous matter. It's what I imagine Harry Potter would have been like had JK Rowling inserted the full text of each and every book after every single mention of books. And there are a lot of books mentioned in Harry Potter.<br /><br />My only other complaint with Ready Player One was that descriptions and synopses had me expecting something dark and gritty and slightly dystopic, with a slick futuristic bent. It actually ended up being kind of kiddish. More Big than Blade Runner.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|With a few functions to keep your Kindle running fast I rate this a 5 star app. It's task killer works like a charm. Plus there is a junk file remover.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This ibook is better than the The Shining. It's not the scary book like The Shining, but there's more heart, depth, and quality of story with this book.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|very good game!  it is easy to access!  it doesn't freeze up and is so easy to understand.  ! has lots of reading but makes interesting
1476729085|5.0|Loved this book- fast read, intriguing, interesting, funny, quirky, charming, alarming... all of the above!  I look forward to reading more work by Graeme Simsion!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play to relax &amp; have fun...not to worry about time running out.  It's also great because it doesn't require<br />WIFI  you can play anywhere!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book gives readers hope and allows you to remember you are not alone in the most terrifying of situations.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is very easy to play. I played it on Facebook at one time but really like this version more. Hope you enjoy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend this book to everybody above age 10<br />Amazing adventures. I really hope that many people would read this amazing book
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Mr. Follet writes the best historical fiction I can find. Sometimes it's hard to take, for example the graphic descriptions of battle or the very common references to sex. Neither are overdone, however, and he always eventually returns to the storylines of the character's lives. I read Fall of Giants, which is about WWI, for both entertainment and education. I wasn't disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very funny. I love how there are different places that you could play in, but sometimes the app freezes. Other than that, its great! Fighting Victor was awesome, too, but it took forever
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great!  Lots of guns to try out.  If you like ww 2 firearms give this a try.  Interesting, lots to try and learn.  Needs more firearms though
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I stopped playing zynga games a long time ago due to mass amounts of lag. Well this game isn't slow or Kathy. Fun and entertaining.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham always tells a good story and the legal battles are always good, the characters are a bit hard to believe in this one though.<br />I know greed is always viable and parental neglect does not breed great love but somehow the characters were just worse than necessary.  The ending was very good and well done and elicits a sadness that comes from having lived through too many of these stories.  I almost knew what was coming because I've lived in the South all my life.  I am getting tired of having to hash through another sordid tale of all that was done wrong.  Perhaps it is necessary but I just don't want to read about it anymore.  Of course we want the younger generation to know about it and I suppose without books like this they would never know how bad it was.  So, I will just wait for another legal thriller by Grisham that isn't about this subject.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is really cool it's like subway surfers but much better I really love this game I was on it last night just completing the goals
1451648537|5.0|Really liked the book and is a good read.  Issaacson did a great job as usual and you really get to know Steve Jobs and what he accomplished.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This game is f u n,but some levels are impossibly hard unless you buy extra lives or wait forever. Very frustrating and distracts from the game.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So I do love this game, but there are two quirks. One, you have to spend money to buy the crowns. Second, it basically needs Facebook and I don't want to share that on my Facebook. Overall graphics were great and gameplay amazing . I hope this was helpful.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Getting lost in this story means enjoying and remembering the many story lines. The series is beginning to illustrate the many faces of the &#34;game of thrones&#34; as hopes and plans rise and fall. The is no clear direction to the throne and the cost may be unendurable. I eagerly await continuing the journey and trusting the author to bring it all together.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|I have it on Pc and mincraft to this game is like minecraft not as good but still its fun but there's  like millions of bosses and creatures so like you will ever finish it.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|More than recommended, if you a a Beatle Fan. If your not but want to know the best band in the history, you have to buy it
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughters room.  It was very easy to apply to the bedroom wall.  I even rearranged the position of the decals several times and had no problem with removing them and they stayed on the wall without peeling off.  There are so many ways you can arrange the grouping.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to add a picture to their wall without harming the paint.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Far from being a innovation. You can only watch YouTube.<br /><br />In the product description it says you can watch and do anything on the web.<br /><br />Why would I pay $35 to watch YouTube? I can do it with a $5 HDMI cable without disconnection and watch anything I want.<br /><br />This product has a lot of potential, one disadvantage is being a Google product. A company does only bare minimum for customer satisfaction.<br /><br />Never been satisfied with a Google product, I guess never will be.<br /><br />off course, it is going back to Google.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very different from most games. This game is challenging but fun. I recommend this game it's really fun and it could be addictive. Wish there was more levels. I enjoy this game so do my children.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|Not necessarily for me, but my kids love it and that is who it is for.  They like others as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is definately one of the best games of all time. I just wish there were other ways to get through towns without using facebook
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hannibal is the masterfully written and stylishly constructed. Bryan Fuller is an amazing genius that leaves me wanting more. I can't wait for season 2!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is awesome I play it everyday.It gets better everyday..My kids even love it they won't stop playing it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Publishing to Kindle for the first time can be frightening and intimidating. After spending weeks, months or maybe even years writing a book we all want it to appear on Kindle in a manner that illustrates our pride of accomplishment and the effort involved. 'Building Your Book for Kindle' may not answer every question for everyone. It is written primarily for MS Word applications, but it does go through the formatting process in enough depth that it makes the process much easier. Do not be fooled by the seemingly simple instructions. If you pay attention and follow the instructions as presented, you will be able to correct problems that are easily missed when writing. I believe that even after successfully submitting several books for publication, it would be wise to review any new work you have created by glancing through 'Building Your Book for Kindle'. For any new and aspiring authors, best wishes, and as Louis Armstrong once said, &#34;Don't die with the music still in you, baby!&#34;
B009NF54ZE|5.0|this game is a experience,the graphics are excellent and the sound great,one of the best game for smartphones.the most important of this game is the use of the logic in the history.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|One of Elton's BEST records of all time. After I downloaded it I burned it to CD, and then listened to it continuously over and over again for a week in my car. I highly recommend it!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Good stuff. Heard about this book when i was a kid, finally read it, you wont rest until you finished it.
B00A4A1KK0|5.0|I don't watch American Idol, but I had heard several of Phillips songs on the radio; so I decided to buy this CD. I am so glad I did!
B00GO95BUU|5.0|This episode shows Whovians some old friends and revisits an old story, yet can be comprehended and enjoyed by a civilian watching Doctor Who for the first time.  Perfect!<br /><br />The documentary, \\"An Adventure in Space and Time\\", is also first-rate, providing some of the history of Doctor Who but not \\"spoiling\\" any of the episodes, so long as the viewer already knows what a Dalek is :)<br /><br />Now that I've also purchased the DVD/BluRay combo:<br />Who needs both the DVD and the BluRay/BluRay 3D in the same package?  I'd have preferred more extras on a second disc, considering the number of BBC specials there were leading up to the 50th Anniversary episode.  Also, trading cards were included.  Why??
B005LZW8FO|2.0|If you're looking for something scifi, look elsewhere. I borrowed this from the local library hoping that it would have some elements of science fiction but there aren't. The main story is about a girl that feels guilty about accidentally killing some guy's family when she drove drunk. That's about it. Very little time is spent dealing with anything related to the second Earth. Anyway, if you're looking for scifi, fantasy, action, adventure, or anything of that nature, look elsewhere. If you like dramas, then you might like this.
1455521310|3.0|If you cut out all the filler this book would only be 200 pages rather than 400. Baldacci writes well, as usual, but he stretched a thin story trying to make it into something it really wasn't meant to be. I slogged through a hundred pages and then started skimming and missed nothing of significance. My wife did the same thing. Not a page turner as they say.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of John Grisham`s best. A great follow up on Ford County. Will recommend too many of my friends
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is the best Bluetooth I've used and I have several, it connects very easy and is very clear, as far as I'm concerned, Plantronics is the best there is, thanks folks at plastron ics!
B00G32TD98|5.0|I had seen the previews for this movie and it looked really good(which it was) but I had no idea this was based on a story on ed and lorraine warren.I met them and talked with them/consulted with them on some of our investigations when our ORIGINAL group of paranormal research team in maine was together(Way before all these tv shows,etc,etc was even thought of).Hats off to my friend Bill w.(paranormal researcher) and of course Ed and lorraine warren! They were all cool and dedicated before anyone knew who they were.I've got TONS of their books from 20+ years ago:) I 100% recommend this movie!!!!! TWO THUNMBS UP!!!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Fun game with a variety of mini games/ puzzles. Challenging enough to be entertaining but easy enough so you don't get frustrated. The graphics are rich and detailed and the music is nice. I play on my Kindle Fire and I am able to pinch to zoom and pan during the find the object games, but it counts as a touch a d you may get penalized for &quot;random touches&quot;. But no worries, you have plenty of time to complete the puzzles.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is a great game, and it is worth the extra space. it keeps me busy for days on end.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love wonder zoo. it should be called wonderful zoo.I love the dinosaurs. I wonder if they will soon have dragons?I cant wait for the next upgrade!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Words escape me about a book whose main character was words. I've never read anything like it. Amazing book. Thank you, Markus Zusak!
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Don't waste money on this poorly written movie.  Not at all funny, this one stretches the already thin characters to the point where you don't have any sympathy for any of them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Comedic game its addicting and I would recommend it to any who likes. the minions cute game but it takes up all ot Uv your. space
0062101897|3.0|The book itself is fantastic, but the construction left a lot to be desired.  My son dropped it (on carpet, and not from a great height) and the binding cracked and the cover came almost all the way off.  Very disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Never ending suspense. Great characters strong in their own individual ways. I recommend these books for all ages over twelve.
B0079J27JW|5.0|I must admit, I really like playing this.  It's actually not that much more fun than the previously issued CD in the &#34;Great Recordings of the Century&#34; series, but there is a noticeable boost in sound detail, and the performances are really great.  This issue adds the Oistrakh performance of the Brahms Violin Concerto, so with all three pieces, it's hard not to give this a rave review.  I share the impatience of other music lovers, who wish EMI would get it together and issue audiophile recordings of some of their great quad recordings of the '70's, and quit hauling this stuff out to reissue the same music for the 8th time.  But that's a separate issue, really, from the value if this.  If you have a Super Audio system, (surround sound not necesary) and don't have these in a suitable previous version, go for it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book couldn't put it down love it love love it can't wait to see the movies ya
B0079J26TI|4.0|I admit I'm a Klemperer nut.  I love the way he pulls the inner detail into focus.  Because of his tendency to go for measured speeds, you might not find these the most exciting versions of these works.  I like Peter Maag for the Scottish, Sir Charles MacKerras with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment for the Italian, and Sawallisch for the Schumann.  But that said, I keep wanting to give these discs a spin, because all three works come off with a unique effect I don't get from my &#34;favorites.&#34;  So if you want a &#34;first choice,&#34; keep shopping, but if like me, you've gained a taste for the old master (try his &#34;Eroica&#34; and his Leonore Overtures) this issue is some mildly expensive fun.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Had to get up at 3:30 a.m. to get to the airport and did not trust my other alarm. Downloaded this for my kindle and put it in the suitcase across the room. My other alarm came on with music, and this had a cacophany of barnyard animals crowing, clucking, mooine, braying etc! I got up lickety split, and a smile on my face. There are other tones of course, many more soothing. But this is the first time I have ever heard all of these!
B00GO95TAC|5.0|THE best thing you will ever see! I love Doctor Who and this was great. The best Doctor Who special I've seen yet!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Very disappointing ending to what could have been a fantastic trilogy. And not for the obvious reasons. This book lacked the heart and intrigue that the first two had, and ended on a very boring note. I couldn't put down Divergent or Insurgent, this one I struggled through to keep my attention, it was very bland. I had high hopes for this series, and it could have been as good as The Hunger Games, but now it isn't even in the same category.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Rush played the game for over two months. Had all three parks going well with over1,000,000 gold coins then the game glitches and sent me to a coupon site and wouldn't let me into the game. After trying everything I could think of I crisscrossing the app. It worked except it wiped out two months of work and started me back at the beginning of the game. Needless to say it was discouraging and made me extremely upset. There should be a way to save your progress and let you reload the app. Also it is aggravating to have to play as a guest because SOME people don't have a Facebook page by choice.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE IT. Now I do but, before I got the hang of it it wasn't much fun because I didn't know what to do. If you don't like monsters speak now forever hold your peace change it to peaceful by going to options and move the bar to the other side where it says difficulty. If u don't the monsters will kill u and u can't sleep in the game. Get a friend to tell u the tips and tricks of mine craft. Also get a friend to tell u a good seed. 0.4.0 and Juan r good. GET THE GAME AND HAVE FUN!!!!!

0375701427|2.0|** spoiler alert ** As someone semi-obsessed with capitalism in American fiction, I opened this book with an open mind. Roth's writing style pulled me right in and kept me reading at a ravenous pace, but the novel just got worse and worse for me as I read, with the third of its three sections being particularly painful. Roth's depiction of capitalism itself didn't bother me in the slightest, in fact I found it spot on and rather impressive. The details of glove manufacturing were interesting to me, and the timing and ways in which the Levov family business moves its facilities off-shore are realistic and well written. What crushed me were a number of other aspects of this book, as follows:<br /><br />I didn't like Roth's introduction of the story as Zuckerman. Why not just tell the Swede's story from the start? Why insert Zuckerman to tell it? But this is the most minor of my complaints.<br /><br />While I actually found Merry Levov's (daughter of Seymour &#34;Swede&#34; Levov and Dawn Levov) story, once revealed, so outrageous to the point of being funny, some of the book's other satirical extremes bothered me. A former NJ beauty queen raising cows? I couldn't take Dawn Levov seriously.<br /><br />The third section of the book reveals the active adultery of Dawn Levov with neighbor William Orcutt III, and a finished, four month adulterous affair between Swede Levov and Sheila Salzman, Merry Levov's former speech therapist. Roth telegraphs the scene in which the Swede finds his wife smooching Orcutt in their kitchen (Dawn and Orcutt don't see the Swede as he catches them in the act) during a dinner party, a scene I saw coming and yet found unconvincing. I did not, however, expect the revelation of the Swede's former adultery, and it really just didn't work for me. Roth portrays the Swede throughout the novel as this guy who's always supposed to have done the right thing, the socially acceptable thing, and then out of left field we learn about his affair with an ancillary character introduced with about the same amount of background as the Swede's other dinner guests.<br /><br />Once the Swede finds Dawn with Orcutt, I would've liked to have seen him snap. I wanted the Swede's mistake, his lapse into being just another flawed human being, to be the verbal or physical bashing of Orcutt, not some affair he'd had years prior. The climax I wanted was the Swede's fury, not Mrs. Orcutt's stabbing of Lou Levov (the Swede's father) with a fork (this happens in the last couple of pages). I felt like I'd earned said non-occurring climax after reading all of Roth's long, mostly boring descriptions of each dinner guest in relation to the Levovs, not to mention a ridiculous, entirely unnecessary flashback to Lou Levov's &#34;interview&#34; with debutante Dawn prior to the Swede and Dawn's marriage.<br /><br />On a separate note, I didn't enjoy Roth's divisive treatment of American Jews versus gentiles. I just found it mean-spirited, in general. By contrast, I always enjoy Bellow's depiction of American Jews and take no issue with the ways in which he distinguishes them.<br /><br />I've now read exactly one novel by each of the authors to whom David Foster Wallace referred as &#34;The Great Male Narcissists.&#34; I guess these guys just don't do it for me; I have no desire to read a second novel by any of them. Too many other authors out there I'd rather read.llary character introduced with about the same amount of background as the Swede's other dinner guests.<br /><br />Once the Swede finds Dawn with Orcutt, I would've liked to have seen him snap.

B001LF3YQK|5.0|I really like this case.  At first, I was disappointed that is was so large, but quickly learned that that's a good thing.  The button is not difficult at all, you just have to get that it's not a button you push down, but slide to the side.  The container has never fallen open, except when my daughter forced it open.  The wipes always stay wet, and I've had it for nearly two years, going strong.

1781162646|5.0|It's funny that this book was marketed as a terror crime novel.  There is a crime and a mystery to solve, but most of it is the coming of age of a young college-aged man.  It's a great story, an easy read, and incredibly moving.  I read it through the night and cried at the end.  Then, my father-in-law read it all the day after.  A great book to take on a vacation or plane ride where you don't have to think about putting it down.  If you're past college age or older, there is a nostalgic quality to the book that makes it additionally enjoyable.  I found myself thinking back to what I was like when I was that age.  No real gore or extreme violence to this one.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I thought the tambourine came out real good, and you can dance to it. It has a nice beat to it too.
0316322407|5.0|Very interesting. Well written and an easy read. 75% of the book has to do with her life before being shot, so, it isn't depressing, just informative about daily life before the Taliban came & clearly, she has a deep love of her country. I really bought it just so she could receive the royalties to finance her new life in England.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because it is so fun when your waiting or playing it any time it's so fun so I would get this game and play it also when you play it it cool to get the game because you get to buy stuff with coins ans bananas so I would get this game and 1more reason you should get the game is because it is free
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|I thought this would be a great game to have. I downloaded it and played the tutorial. When I tried to play the first race, all I got was the app stop running. Please fix immediately. I've tried it numerous times and the same results. It would have been five stars
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie is SO funny! I have recommended it to most my family and ALL my friends! It's more comedy than it is horror. It is really gory though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game is a classic. My first read was in the mid 90's.  I purchased the ebook because I could not find the hard copy, moved a few times, and I wanted to be fresh before I watched the movie. It was not a disappointment. The book has twists and turns that will keep anyone engaged. Ender is the end game.  I would recommend this for the avid SCIFI type all the way down to the significant other that thinks their &#34;other&#34; is simply a geek!  This is a good read with so many turns it will keep anyone guessing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app. The game is totally addictive. I have it on the kindle both smart phones, my whole family loves to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game in the world of games and no and I mean no game could top it. It is much much better than if looks I swear.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Don't get this app. Totally fun and addictive. Hubby has to hide my phone, but he doesn't play. Set a timer before you start, so you don't get lost in the game. Have fun and enjoy. Cheers
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a great game like temple run but better. Try it your self it is worth it. Trust me. I know.
B00EB9Z9Z2|5.0|i 100% recommend reading this book, whether you just want to read it to become better in the life you're living now, give more back, or you want to succeed in your life, i read the book in less then 3days. i have never read a book in this amount of time. its an amazing work of art, it teaches so much through other people's experiences, its must have. if you had any doubts that you can achieve your dreams, i guarantee you that after reading this book and researching the people in it and knowing that everything is true, you will fasten your belt and start working like never before.

B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is worth the three dollars. It is a challenge which extends game play and keeps me playing. All it needs is more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome and really cool u should download this really cool and great for kids and older u must download this u must awesome game

B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, I freaking loved this episode.  Brilliant, just brilliant.  The writing, acting, directing; all of it was top notch and just perfect.  I couldn't ask for a better episode.  Loved it!
B0002858YS|5.0|They just keep getting better and better and never disappoint. It took too long for North America to give them their due. They received it in Europe first!!!  We are getting our share now. Thank God!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very exciting, suspenseful, and challenging.  Hard to put down at any point. A complete entertaining experience throughout the story. Thank you
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Super fun to play<br />I like it slot<br />Need more acorns<br />Scrat takes them all<br />Need to try this game out
B00G4I1CLS|3.0|Not worth the hype. Just like every other documentary. If you want a good documentary to watch go rent the cove.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Really good aim but I think it moves a bit too much when in fool zoom. Almost impossible to shoot two animals in one sitting.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|game should come with a way to earn more lives without facebook connection. It should be free considering its addictive.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's so good.. Will be hard to beat!! I could not put it down. Love John Grisham!! Hope you do too!!
B001QE9WEO|2.0|The movie is good in the beginning but tours the end is just starts skipping very desapointed waste of money
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I use to play this on Facebook, really glad it's available for my kindle. The graphics are excellent, vivid colors. Zynga always has some great stuff. Hope they release farmville for kindle as well. This app has a great story line. Easy to follow and alot of fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great app I love it I can't stop playing it. It great for kids/adults of all ages my ten year old girl can't stop playing it it's not gender specific it is so fun you should buy it wait it's free p.s there's a little loading in the beginning but the wait is worth it please for your own good get this for you and your kid I loved it my daughter loved you'll love it get.
0399157573|5.0|Ms Cornwell has done a nice job of incorporating recent horrific current events into this story and making it seem to belong there.  I also liked how she is tying the present of &#34;Dust&#34; to her past, Marino's, Benton's, and Lucy's.  I kept wondering what the dust of the title would turn out t be, and how clever it ended up being!  It's so good to read about Scarpetta.  I was afraid Ms C would mothball her and start another character series; glad that doesn't appear to be the case.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for the next book.
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|She has the best voice. I love Christmas music also. I love this album. I will probably buy her second one as well.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|The movie is charming. The actors are great performers. Love the interpretation of the novel. Love the music and its arrangement. Will never get tired of watching this. Makes me feel good!
B00EBDXSOW|5.0|love it and love the band. Who doesnt love Metallica!!! I cant live without them hahaha and it was a great price too.
1416972250|5.0|Wonderful condition and wonderful read! I would recommend this series to anyone who likes science fiction. I can not wait to get the next book and I will look at amazon first to find it!
0062107313|5.0|Violet grows up in a courtesan house in Shanghai, in the early years of the 20th Century. Her American mother and Chinese friend Golden Dove are partners in owning the house, which is unique in catering to a mixed clientele of wealthy Chinese and foreigners. Violet has no idea, in her little girl days, that she's not fully a white American by ancestry. When her mixed heritage finally registers, she's outraged by both the assault on her sense of self and her mother's reaction to the reappearance of her long absent Chinese father. Violet believed him to be both white and dead, and he's neither. Furthermore, she has a brother and her mother desperately wants to be reunited with &#34;Teddy&#34; - who was two days old when her lover's family took him from her, leaving her Violet to raise alone.<br /><br />Lucia (or Lulu) Minturn, Violet's mother, boards a ship for San Francisco believing that Violet will join her before the ship sails. Instead, the man to whom she entrusted her daughter sells 14-year-old Violet to another courtesan house. Lucia doesn't realize what's happened until it's too late. Violet, trapped in servitude to a madam who has bought her quite properly under the Chinese legal system, struggles to accept her new life with the help of Magic Gourd, who was once a courtesan in the house run by Violet's mother. The girl grows into a woman, experiences love and betrayal not once by many times, and eventually understands her mother better when she has similar tragic experiences.<br /><br />This book is classic Amy Tan, a tale of mothers and daughters movingly told from both viewpoints. It's also a richly woven story of a China (and a United States) now far in the past, brought to vivid life by Tan's writing. My one complaint is where it ended. I wanted Violet's story to continue! I haven't known Tan to write a sequel, but for this book I hope she will. I found it a rare treat.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner &#34;Regs&#34;#34;Regs&#34;
B009XIXVU6|3.0|A good read, but I liked his other books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, better than this book.
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|The Luminaries.<br /><br />It is original, well written, gripping story line. I liked the fact that the language fits thera in which the story takes place - and, of course, it is about New Zealand!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book.i missed some of my shows that I watch on tv because I just had yo see what else was going to go on.i am looking forward to seeing the movie.I hope it is as good as the book.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a great tool &amp; I love the audio pronunciation feature. However,I can't find any instructions on how to create &amp; add words to the &quot;Favorites&quot; category. Does anyone know how to do this?
B0014DQSG2|5.0|I love this movie, it's actually two romance movies in one. One for YA and one for us older folks. It's about finding lost family, lost loves and finding yourself. It's about finding what is paramount in your life and pursuing that. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it. Enough said!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addicting!!!! Not as easy as easy as you might think, but is easy to learn, love the different areas
B000I5XOW8|5.0|What can I say, it's Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones at their best, combined with a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Great surprise ending too! Five stars!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Interesting book written from the perspective of the person who is mentally ill.  This books opens your eyes to the feelings of the mentally ill.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the variety and the challenges of these games. Makes them more fun to play. I hope to make it to the end someday soon.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|The Black Eagle Inn is the sort of novel--I love family sagas--I sometimes worry will drag me away from everything else and never let go. Bull's eye! Christoph Fischer's story thrilled and pulled me deep inside the Hinterberger clan to the point that I was talking to them out loud, remonstrating when they didn't get it right ... or got drowned in righteousness. What I especially enjoyed was the presence of mind and clarity with which the author depicted each family character. I've been studying people all my life, and Anna, Markus, Maria, even Antoine and Esat were dead on. I have also known some Hans-Ulrich's and a few Lukas' in my day. I could not have portrayed them any better.<br /><br />The tale is not an uncommon one. A big family, torn apart by war and famine. Can greed and jealousy be far behind? What make this story so unique, are the rendition and the voice behind the premise. As you round the first few chapters, you slowly let go and begin to trust Christoph Fischer's rhythm, promising all dilemmas will lead to solutions or well-deserved changes. This is how the decades seem to fly by until sadness seeps in when you realize the people you've befriended have come to the end of their journey.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Voyager is a awesomely satisfying continuation of the story of Claire & Jamie from the Outlander series!  It keeps you guessing and biting your lip, re-reading pages over and over & takes you in a whole new direction that fans are all too happy to go!
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|We love this version of the Monsters story. Our kids loved the original, but my wife and I both feel this one has a storyline that's a bit advanced for our little ones. Not that they don't enjoy it, they do, but so far they haven't grasped on to it as lovingly as the original. Still, the movie is very cute and sure to be a fun one to watch over and over again for years to come.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|A fantastic balance of features. Includes old time favorites even some christmas songs.<br /><br />Real easy to start playing right away... the best part is you can practice with headphones.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|oh man i loved it! it was a great event and it was just so awesome!!!! i fangirled so hard my Doctor Who boner has never been this big!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent work, it was a page- turner. I couldn't put it down. I hope there is more to come because I loved these books
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|3 Easy steps setup , with great video quality (depends on internet broadband) :Full HD. Very cheap & easy to use.
0345525558|5.0|I really liked this book. It's different, and the plot is not predictable. The characters seemed real. The plot is a bit contrived, but after all, it's fiction!
B008C20TDG|5.0|Very informative! Loved the book. I am glad I bought it. I am on my second week of the whole30 and I couldn't be happier!
0385344228|5.0|The topic is interesting, and the characters are well developed. This was a book club read, and it generated a good discussion. The plot is believable.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|love this movie, shows the bad in groups whether they be radical religous groups, perverts or the law and what happened when they butted heads. action packed, have watched it several times, you love this or you hate this,seems women hated this movie more times than men, but it is brutal at times, John Goodman is excellent in this movie.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Interesting history of the band and it's members. After seeing them in concert recently it expands on the theme of the tour. Excellent.
B00FQMVCEA|4.0|I like it. Most people are saying that its not a Pixar thing well they kind of right and kind of wrong. The names have changed I think Pixar is now apart of Disney Animation so no Its Pixar but all the people that were there at Pixar are with Disney Animation I think I don't have hard facts just the fact that I saw a photo of PIxar employees with the founders and then saw the same photo for Walt Disney Animation Studios.<br /><br />About the movie I liked it with all the references to the VF-84 Joly Rodgers (a really good assault wing) the Corsair (an awesome warplane for back in the day) I think I saw I BF-109 in there too. I loved the entire sequence of the Flysienhower ... awesome.<br /><br />Also noticed they Sinbad (saw him live) Cedric the Entertainer and Gabriel Igleses (hard to pick out didn't sound like himself at times.) Fluffy did good.<br /><br />Its a movie that would entertain the kids as well as the adults. My only gripe is that story line seems a little familiar with that of a story line involving a racing snail. Not exactly the same but kind of similar. The movie did have its moments (like all movies) at bit predictable here and there but nevertheless still enjoyable.<br /><br />Other than that I liked it and will be watching it for a third time in less than 24 hours. Its defiantly worth renting. I couldn't recommend you to buy it because I'm still trying to decide that for myself. :)
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love the graphics and totally addicted to the game. Wish the vault had more space for all the fun stuff you make, or could buy the items needed for upgrade. All around great fun game
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Nice movie. I love this movie and will buying it.<br /><br />I will say this. They do carried away with certain aspects of the movie but other than that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.
079073463X|5.0|Love story about a man and woman (Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer) seperated by a curse, he is a wolf and she is a bird, they only get to see each other at dusk and dawn.<br /><br />Ah, but when there is an eclipse they are able to change things. Great story!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Most people hate this movie because Will Smith's son is in here and so take hate because of that. I loose count of how many movies feature family members ... hell Tom Arnold's claim to fame was him getting married to Roseanne. It happens all the time.<br /><br />As I matter of fact I thought it was really cool seeing a father work alongside his son. All that aside the movie was okay. It wasn't good but it wasn't bad. Its worth renting in my book.<br /><br />I love science fiction and the technology employed was impressive but I think the movie focused a bit too much on the tech. And the enemy is weird too and though the concept behind it artistically speaking is awesome its weird the enemy once see it you'll start question the logic behind its development a bit.<br /><br />They all had the weird accents I'll leave that there.<br /><br />And for the life me their weapons were not what I expect them to be. Yes a Klingon uses a Batleth (or however you spell it) but they also use a ranged weapon ... no ranged weapons in this movie kind of a let down.<br /><br />Other than I found myself not completely entertained but not bored with it either. That's why I say its worth renting ... its interesting.
B000VUCIZE|4.0|The End of Faith is good, but not great.  Certainly, it is loaded with unique, eye-opening perspectives, but it is also filled with repetitive babble, and never really talks about why faith is dying (which I was hoping to read about).  It spends a lot of time attacking the ridiculous level of faith that Muslims have, and only scratches the surface of Christian faith.  I wanted (or perhaps needed) a book that destroys Christian faith, and this isn't it.<br /><br />The book also feels a bit dated.  There is a lot of talk about Iraq and president Bush, but those two things just aren't newsworthy anymore.<br /><br />Also, Harris is just an okay writer.  The whole time I felt as though I was reading a bunch of ideas that were crunched together and not very clearly expressed.  Atheists like Richard Carrier are much better writers.  I'm not saying that Harris is a BAD writer, just an okay one.<br /><br />Still, if you want a load of very interesting perspectives on faith, you may enjoy this book.  But if you want fresher writing, there is more out there.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|There were scenes were I question the logic of characters actions. But I found the movie overall to be a great movie. I love the concept, creativity of the team, and direction. They did a good job with matching the voices with certain characters too.<br /><br />Somewhat predictable is my only gripe at this time. Some things you can see coming and some thing you can't
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Has lapses at times and freezes but fun. We like dodge items games and love despicable me. So them together makes me happy happy happy
B000001OAA|5.0|Miss Manson has a great voice and this group will always be current in its greatness.  Whenever it rains here in the desert, I turn up the volume in my car with their song &#34;I Love It When It Rains&#34;
B009KS4XRO|5.0|IF YOU YOU LOVE BINGO THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE LOVE THE SLOTS TOO<br />LOTS OF FUN AND NEW ROOM FOR THE HOLIDAYS ARE THE BEST
0312427999|5.0|Naomi Kleoin is such a great journalist and writer! She examines the criminal behavior of GeoW Bush and his dastardly way of getting into a war which had zero to do with the 9/11 attack (my words not hers). Its just as the other books I've read describe how you get a great mass of people to succumb to compliance by fear. Hitler did it with setting fire to Germany's parliment bldg and Roosevelt did it by letting the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor just so the polls of Americans against getting involved in WWII would change, which it did.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|Best movie of all time. Anyone who says otherwise can suck a fat one. Buy this movie now, get multiple copies so you never loose it.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Yes, Mr. Gore, you did a great job with this one. But before I saw yours, another doc came out on HBO a similar and better done film about global warming called &#34;Too Hot To Handle&#34;
B00G32PQNA|5.0|Excellent! I cannot believe that how amazingly accurate and &#34;real&#34; these movies really are, especially since I've grown up with all three- I was 21 when Sunrise came out, 30 when Sunset debuted, and now I'm 39.  This one is maybe the best by just a little due to it's perfect portrayal of what a marriage/relationship is really like after children and many years of being together.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very well written,story moved along at a steady pace, was timely. The protagonist was well liked and not some silly vampire. Classic Americana, classic, Grisham.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|At the advice of a friend, I bought the Kindle Paper white. I was happy to discover &#34;Building Your Book for Kindle&#34; (preparing a manuscript for publishing), for its guidelines on submitting manuscripts for publication. I read the entire book, highlighted important information, and am now in the early stages of making appropriate adjustments for my manuscripts to meet the requirements for publication . The process for publishing is somewhat challenging, but I am confident, by following the manual, I will be able to do it successfully. I especially appreciated the step by step directions for using Office Word, and how to get an electronic copyright.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it, just wish it was easier to get locations and outfits faster!!!!! Keep up the good work guys and gals
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Game gets old not to mention the 5 lives and then they try to sucker you into buying more lives.  I guess kids don't know the difference as we are growing a society of complete morons who don't have the social skills of a baboon.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Really pleasantly surprised by this film.  It had quite a few laugh out loud moments and lots of chuckles throughout.  I did not expect it to be as funny as it is.  Make sure to check out the outtakes at the end; the giant Mexican goon outtake is hilarious.
1419701533|5.0|Great variety of books for diary of a wimpy kid. Jeff Kiney is a great writer for kids. I give him a five star
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Only on level 13 and it is already gonna cost over $25 just to open one of the game's Dragon character. Went up a few levels to see if the price went down but no. It's 750 crowns for the Dragon. Does not have any way to win the crowns other than one at a time as a reward for some quests. I prefer a free game that I can still enjoy daily with specials that can be purchased for $1-2 a week. Afraid to even think what the next special characters or building might cost.  Gonna give it a few more days but if it cost $25 plus a week to play why make it free, just charge by the hour. At least gameloft has mini games to win you special &quot;tokens, coins, acorn, etc). I will give it a few more days and then it will probably end up wasted space on my cloud drive.
0425261360|5.0|Very engaging book taking you back into Dr. Scarpetta's life like you never left it. Intriguing plot with a surprising end.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Tried on a whim a couple of days ago.  I like it much better than the original game that I tried on Facebook and got frustrated with.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is great device although I realize that there are many other ways to stream. But for this low price and simplicity as well as portability (bring it anywhere), You get almost seamless streaming that for me has worked perfect every time. I see a video on YouTube on my phone that I want to see better, share with others, etc. I turn TV on and simply start the video on my phone or tablet and press the streaming icon on that device. It is now playing flicker free on my TV. Of course you must have an HDMI port on the TV as well as a USB port (for power) or a wall socket avail for the power cord if no USB (Everything you need comes with unit).
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Bought the vinyl  3 lp version of  this, as I like the sound of the new high grade vinyl being used, and I can actually read the print on the info about the songs. The package differs from the cd version, putting all the songs on 2 lps and the  individual interviews on the third( one section for each Beatle.)  .  Sound quality varies from excellent to fair.  The fair tracks sound like they were mastered from off air recordings rather than BBC tapes(i.e. TALKIN ABOUT YOU) . What keeps me from giving this  5 stars is that what we really got was 2 lps of music  for the price of 3 (How many times are we really gonna play those interviews??)  and from reading  THE COMPLETE BEATLES CHRONICLE  , there are still more songs  yet to be heard that could have been included on this set.  Maybe In another 19 years??
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my second time reading this book and it (yet again) swept me off my feet!<br />This book it truly amazing and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good read.<br /><br />P.S.  The above review was written by my daughter who is 12.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I think it's a good game. But why do we have to pay for goods we need like if we need more crowns. Do you know what I mean. It's fun to play but it gives so many notifications.
B00FY2UJAU|4.0|I love all the Fast and the Furious movies.  This one isn't as intense as some, but it's a good movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is an awesome game..it offers daily credits as well as a 5 round free tournament daily...it does make it difficult to collect all of the pieces to the rounds, but that's what makes you keep returning to play!!
B0009JAENU|5.0|Delicate, delightful Mozart is here played by compatible collaborators whose performance is competently captured in digital stereo on a flawlessly produced compact disc.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I would like to say this isn't a wanna be Minecraft game. Terraria is a Role Play, and has its own concept. With this, there are many different monsters such as:<br />Green Slime<br />Zombie<br />Demon Eye<br />And more to come, being that this is only around the third update. I haven't seen every single monster yet, and I haven't been a big Terraria fan. This is actually my first time playing Terraria. But with this game, there also comes:<br />Building<br />Local Multiplayer<br />PvP<br />Mining<br />Many different blocks<br />And, once again more to come. If this is your first time playing Terraria, the controls are a breeze especially if you haven't played on Xbox or PC.<br /><br />Overall, I give this game a ***** out of *****!
B00G21YGKQ|5.0|The actual 50th anniversary special--does anyone know when it will be available on Amazon (or some other platform)? I know it was broadcast today on BBC America, but not having cable that doesn't help . . . any info greatly appreciated, as I haven't been able to find out yet from other internet sources.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved this game I play it every day if you are wanting this game get it now you will love it it is so fun
006202406X|1.0|The random switching POV was confusing and annoying.  Tobias' personality seemed completely different in this book than in the previous two, he was a whiny baby that Tris constantly had to apologize to.  The history of the establishment of the city seemed poorly thought out, way too many potential holes.  There is no real closure as to who this evil masterminding government is and how or why they possibly created this society by brainwashing the whole country.  The existence of people living in other countries is completely ignored. What was the benefit?  Control? To what end?  I didn't even mind the end that seemed to make other people cry, I lost all investment in the characters in this book.<br /><br />This book felt like it was written by a completely different person than the first two.  I don't recommend this at all, I would have been happier just ending with Insurgent.  The series had great potential and totally failed.  Huge disappointment.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Love the game but can't get any money...every time I back out my money and rank is set back to nothing. Plz fix
B000YJ54DU|3.0|This was all right. I think that it was never cleared why the town was bad from the start. Everyone was antagonistic in this book.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I was never a fan of short stories, but the compactness and impact of Grisham's talent in these stories is incredible.  I was sorry to have each end.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Books like this are hard to read because the characters and names are so confusing. I have read many books by Philippa Gregory because I enjoy this genre of books and I enjoyed reading this book. I admit I looked up the characters in Wikipedia so that I could keep the character and story line straight. The writing is interesting as is the subject matter but it is not an exciting book to read. It is just an interesting book about the history of English monarchs . I would recommend the book if you like this genre.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|Great concert by a great artist & group! Recently saw them in concert. Wanted to hear  & see them again!
B004FQX59I|5.0|I had this on vhs.  bought it again on dvd.  I saw a showing of the film that of the shooting.  If you watch in slow motion you will see three lines coming from the front side of the car towards the president but miss.  before one of the bullets actully hit.  I dont know if the show was on pbs or another channel.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Fun hide and seek or rather find the hidden object.  A little wordy but you can breeze through to the next puzzle. Good for the FGOTD.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Love it.  Typical Grisham, there is always a husband and wife in most of his books who can't stand each other and want out of the marriage!  I'm glad to see a lot of old friends:  Harry Rex, Willie Traynor, Lucien, and mentions of some from other books.  Fun read, there Ancil's story is very interesting, I'm sure there is some truth to a lot of the story -- property taken, oil wells taken, stuff like that.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love the various categories and the different British viewpoint.  This is more entertaining and comprehensive to view and read than watching any TV news program plus each article will provide a slide show or at times a video link to enhance each article.
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|All time classic. Want to see every time. Even my kids want to watch the movie again and again. LOVE it!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I didn't understand all the hype about this game, but now I've seen the light. So addicting, I never want to put it down!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|LADY GAGA can't really shock us anymore (at least I don't think so and/or care) but for me it's mostly about the music anyway.  She writes some of the best pop dance music out there.  Love this new album.  Sometimes she tries a little too hard (Jewels N' Drugs, Manicure, Fashion!), but the stakes and pressure are so high for her to outdo herself that this is understandable.  And besides, the highlights here far outweigh any of the B.S. which inevitably goes with being a character as big and phenomenal as LADY GAGA.<br /><br />Strongest tracks IMHO:  Aura, Venus, G.U.Y., Sexxx Dreams, Do What You Want, Artpop, Swine (mind-blowing), Applause.<br /><br />Honorable Mention:  Donatella, Mary Jane Holland, Dope, Gypsy<br /><br />And let's not forget, Stephani Germanotta is a better singer than most (if not all) pop artists out there, she's a wildly gifted songwriter, and none of that really has anything to do with all the hoopla surrounding the &#34;aura&#34; of Lady Gaga.<br /><br />ARTPOP is basically Lady Gaga's third &#34;greatest hits&#34; album in a row.<br /><br />Best song on the album (AND THIS BETTER BE A SINGLE!!!):  SEXXX DREAMS<br />Hands down.<br /><br />Warning to Lady Gaga:  &#34;Fashion!&#34; will be panned as yet another Madonna rip-off (the groove is lifted directly from Holiday).  Why???  You are an original icon in your own right!!!
B0000844M8|5.0|Talk about nostalgia.  I first saw &#34;Born Free&#34;, in the movies, as a teen.  It left quite an impression.  I really wanted to see it, again, after so many years.  It did not disappoint!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Long lost David Lynch movie soundtrack?  From start to finish BORN TO DIE is creepy, sexy, cool.<br /><br />Is she the best singer in the world?  Who cares?!  I view this album as an art project that totally works.  Great songs, dark sexy lyrics with a gorgeous ice queen delivering the sleaze and desperation.<br /><br />Rock on, Lana Del Rey.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Great product, very versatile, glad it works with both Android and iPhones (with an iPhone cable), and charges at proper speeds (not over 1A as that is not good for phones yet).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Rarely does a book grip my imagination so much that I stay up late two nights in a row to read it. This one did just that. The first person narrative is both heart warming and chilling as Katniss describes her life before and during the Hunger Games. I immediately bought the two remaining books in the trilogy I intend to start reading Catching Fire today.<br />If you have not read this, I heartily recommend it!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Baldacci 's mind is incredibly agile and impressive with the twists, turns, and imagination of his plots. This book was one of the best and I've read all of Baldacci's and a great many other authors. Please keep on giving us more insights into your imagination!

B00ERIUO02|5.0|This is a great album!!! This one is full of heart and feeling.  Definitely a more mature and deeper emotion!
B00BBND56G|5.0|This VHS box set is the first of one thing, and the last of another.  Let me explain what I mean here.<br /><br />These tapes are the very first ones featuring THX from Industrial Light and Magic.  Before this set was released, THX was only available in movie theaters.  After these tapes were released, THX has become featured on both VHS and DVD.<br /><br />The thing that these tapes are the last of is the original theatrical release of Star Wars Episodes 4, 5 and 6.  After 1995 when these tapes were released, the Star Wars Special Edition of the movies came out.  When the Special Editions of the movies came out, it was goodbye to the original movies for the most part.  Those of you who own this and the Special Edition version know what I mean.<br /><br />If you want to own and see the original Star Wars movies as they first appeared in the theaters, these videotapes are the only way to do so.
B00GO95BUU|5.0|A bit slow at the beginning and overly complicated, but it builds to a very satisfying ending. I wish John Hurt had more time....like say a few years of playing the Doctor.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As many are aware, this game is very hard to put down.  Playing on my Kindle is just like playing on Facebook.  Recommend highly.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This games graphics are sick and its just awesome buy this one not the 0.99 one the other one is lame but buy this one
B000000OAL|5.0|This is a great album.  Early Queen was a mix of medieval mysticism, metal, and musicianship.  It's a class, without a bad song on the whole disc.  I prefer this earlier, heavier Queen over the later &#34;Another One Bites The Dust&#34; band that crept dangerously towards disco and a top 40 mentality.  This album is the long-haired, sharp-featured Freddie Mercury on the rampage, looking like a majestic bird of prey, with the voice of a song-bird.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book was good, the plot wasn't something you normally find, so bonus points there. But in my opinion the book lacked depth, that thing that makes you want to keep reading. The characters seem slightly empty in the way they are described. The emotions of the characters was not there to me. You couldn't feel Peetas love, nor Katniss' desperation with Prim and the games. Not many things were described in detail which would give you a better understanding. It didnt make you feel as  if you were watching the games or maybe even part of them. You couldn't feel that.  Now granted this is coming from someone who's only fourteen but thats my take.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I think its awesome because you can buy horses and all the cool horse stuff like sattels whips riding clothes ex. crime Noah
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I have arrived at level 30 and have enjoyed this game but for the last several levels I have had to removed plantings so that I may plant new things.  my reef has not been expanded in quite some time,  am I missing something or too bad  it also now takes weeks to get past a level my currant level needs 500,000 points to achieve the next level and I have been given a task for a planting that is not available until two levels past where I am.  what kind of sense does that make???  I have liked very much until now but will probably no longer play.  The fact that I must have dug up dozens of plants that I 'bought' is a problem..  sorry nemo
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Very lame.<br />I don't mind &#34;earning&#34; higher levels, but the games are just so DUMB, you don't even want to play them!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game my horse so much. I have two horses.:) I would tell all my friends.<br />Yeah I love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy the game is relaxing and some levels are more challenging. This is a great way to destress and past time while you are waiting for an appointment.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, fun, simple to learn but it keeps you entertained for a long time. If you haven't played it yet, you may not want to start because you won't want to stop.
B00A6J9SM6|4.0|Great introduction to this new tool! Not to dense, but hits on all the important topics. Well worth it !
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.  They make me add more words so here are more words to fulfill the requirement of more words.
B0081ISUOG|4.0|Well, I tested this on Kindle Fire HD.<br />I mainly use the timer as an alarm clock.<br />Yes, it does work without internet connection and does alert you when your device is asleep, too. It also works while you use another app.<br />The graphic interface looks very crude, so only 4 stars, but the many options are nice. Just press the menu button :)<br />There are also over a HUNDRED different alarm tones, I didn't see it at first so here I stand corrected.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|Don't waste your time or money to watch this - horrible props, costumes, music and storyline.  Bad attempt to pass on the &#34;hero&#34; role to his son.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|A solid Lee Child novel.  Fast start, a little slow in the middle but solid Reacher-style revenge in the end.
0761169253|5.0|Kleon put into words the philosophy about creativity I have at least suspected, if not practiced, for several years.  He's given me justification for hoarding and using the best ideas - the ones that &#34;speak&#34; to my creative spirit - and given me a concrete way of passing these on to other &#34;creatives&#34; by gifting them with his book.<br />I follow his blog now, and look forward to his next book.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|I wanted to love this book. But it ended up annoying me. There were too many characters introduced in the very beginning, and I found it hard to realize where the proper plot picked up. The Catholic stereotype was taken too far and I found myself angry at the portrayal. The book also dangles secrets before the reader, and while this tactic can be done wonderfully to increase suspense, here it felt cheap and frustrating.<br />I wanted to like the book. The central conflict meshes with but doesn't drown the conflict of Ender's Game, and meeting
B005COO1X6|3.0|Stephen King has been my favorite author since I read my first King book  &#34;Cujo&#34;, in the sixth grade.  This book was good, but compared to his other works it was just ok.

0385349947|5.0|A must for every woman, particularly those just beginning their careers.  The idea that the most important decision that a woman can make regarding her career is the life partner she chooses is brilliant and one that I've shared with my young adult daughter.  While nothing in the book is earth-shattering, the clarity with which Sandberg relates her advice is refreshing (and laugh-out-loud funny at times!)
006224454X|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Story moved at a nice pace, keeping me interested, did not want to put it down.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|The story was too predictable and characters were not fully developed. The writer kept constant tension with every imaginable event that could go wrong, not allowing the reader to absorb the details. It was hard to imagine that characters would behave so naïvely of the circumstances around them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was such a great book. I remember reading the shinning when I was a teenager and this brought back all of the memories. One of the best books I've read this year.
B0041OOEJY|1.0|As a fan of the original Karate Kid movie, I honestly had trouble even getting through this movie.<br />First off my minor gripes.<br />While Jackie Chan was enjoyable as he tends to be I found Jayden Smith to lack depth in his acting and character.  They also seemed to go for a lot of spectacle with giant sweeping temple scenes, training on the Great Wall, etc. that are visually impressive but leave the movie less \\"down to earth\\" as the original film which I felt caused it to lose some of its believability and warmth.<br />Now my major gripes.<br />The film is based off of and named the Karate Kid, yet it takes place in China and the martial arts featured in it is Kung Fu, not Karate.  It makes no sense to have Karate in the name when there is none in the movie.<br />Also the movie seemed to highlight what I felt were a lot of stereotyped views of the Chinese and Asians as a whole.<br />All in all the original is leaps and bounds better than the reboot and this version should just be forgotten so that it can fade into mediocrity.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|I haven't seen other games like this, the goal is to make words from letter groups using the definitions provided. There are hints ans you can select how revealing they can be,  which adds to the variety.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I continually find myself liking each subsequent Reacher novel more than the last. This one was no exception to that rule. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and Lee Child was able to make me hate the bad guys just as much as Reacher did. Thank you for this awesome character!
1427235392|5.0|Ender's Game is an amazing book! The audio version is outstanding!! There are several actors who read the story and it makes the story come alive. I have listened to dozens of audio books and this one has to be my favorite because of the fact that there are over so many actors that participate in the reading. The changes in the voices help to create the characters in the listeners mind and it adds to the story overall. I highly recommend the novel and the audio version.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|I have read all of philippa Gregory's novels.  This is one of her best.  I didn't want the book<br />To end.  Thoroughly recommend.

B00DW1WR14|5.0|I grew up with this band and Ten in the early 90's... and twenty plus years later, I'm still amazed at the excellent creations they continue to produce. Either you're a PJ phan or you're not. Thankful for every opportunity to see them live!
B00GO95TAC|3.0|First of all, I wish people would rate the dumb episode based on whether or not it is ANY GOOD, and not because of the price they charged.<br /><br />More to the point... definitely could not have given this episode even close to a 4 star rating, and it barely squeaks by as a 3.  Steven Moffat the writer of Doctor Who for the several years, has really brought down the series to being, not only boring, but predictable, overly embarrassingly sentimental, and very, very unimaginative.  Quite honestly, I think ANY of us who are true die-hard Doctor Who fan could have written a better story line celebrating the 50th years to the month of Doctor Who shows, than Moffat.<br /><br />My complaints are as follows and may complain spoilers, so do not read if you want to know thoughts on the episode before seeing it and judging for yourself.<br /><br />1.  This was just another &#34;THE THREE DOCTORS&#34; episode, which was broadcast in four weekly parts from 30 December 1972 to 20 January 1973.  It starred three Doctors, Pertwee, Troughton, and my favorite Hartnell (who had a very small part since he was very sick at the time).  Basically, it was a story about immortality and the ability to time travel discovered by &#34;Omega&#34; who was a Time Lord at the time, but wanted to become mortal again since the time winds had destroyed his body.  You have to watch this episode but there are a lot of cross over plots.  (So much for &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; being original).<br /><br />2.  Next, what happened to the trailer where the Gallifreyan Guardsman spotted the first attack of the Dalek's breaking through the time dam's, during the first trailer about the upcoming major episode.<br /><br />3.  What happened to involving any of the prior companions, which for nostalgic reasons would have meant so much to those of us who are hard-core fans.<br /><br />4.  Moffat claimed that he wanted a story line in which anyone, EVEN those with absolutely NO &#34;Doctor Who&#34; history with the show, could understand it and enjoy it.  IN OTHER WORDS, more concerned with profit than story.<br /><br />5.  Too much time is spent with the William Hurt Doctor, fussing over what to do and speaking to rose, lots of time that could have been better spent on a better story.  (in other words, time killing, typical Moffat writing style)<br /><br />6.  The story is boring, unexciting, adds nothing new to understanding the doctor more, and what is with the Doctor having to marry Queen Elizabeth the 1st.  What possible purpose does that hold in an anniversary special.  DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.<br /><br />7.  Both the two VERY first companions of the doctor, William Russell as Ian Chesterton and the very own Granddaughter of the doctor also not involved in the anniversary special.  Personally, I would LOVE to have known WHY the doctor felt the need to escape from Gallifrey and what was the true relationship between himself and Susan his Granddaughter.  They could have covered this at the very beginning for a lousy 5 minutes instead of the Tardis swinging stupidly from a helicopter to Buckingham palace.<br /><br />8.  Why the Zygons in this Anniversary special... they did not play a huge role as his adversary during the past 50 years and made no impact on the excitement of the story-line.<br /><br />9.  William Hurt as the Doctor who decides to destroy all of Gallifrey and the Dalek's is never mentioned in any prior episodes and they had a whopping 12 doctors to choose from who could have been responsible for that action, such as Tom Baker, and then he would have had a MUCH bigger role.  Personally, his appearance was the only thrill I got from the show.<br /><br />10. Where is Romanadvoratrelundar, for short known only as Romana, I know, I know, she is in E-Space, but she is the 2nd Time Lord to be alive in the Universe so the Doctor, technically is NOT really alone,  Lalla Ward, who played her after the KEY OF TIME series, is still alive and would be wonderful to haveseen again, helping the Doctor, or even just with assisting Tom Baker.  She played a crucial role during the recovery of the Key of Time, yet she continues to go on unheard, but &#34;Riversong&#34; (Rori and Amy Ponds child) is always showing up in every episode, saying &#34;Spoilers!&#34;<br /><br />11.  This was the BIGGEST opportunity on the planet for Doctor Who to shine after 50 years of running and it was like any other Moffat episode, I even read he was very worried about this episode being liked after its release.  They could have brought back &#34;Russell T. Davies&#34;  The BEST damn writer from 2005 starting with Eccleston and Tennent.  Moffat made a sporadic for the show from (2005-2013).  A collaboration of the best sci-fi writers in Britain was what was really called for in order to pull off this show.<br /><br />12.  Lastly, I don't know where the show will go on from here, the newest Doctor is actor, Peter Capaldi, who was last seen on a Doctor Who episode called &#34;Fires of Pompeii.&#34;  From his appearance only, he looks more like an aging, experienced doctor than the pin-ups we have been getting before, except for David Tennent whom in my opinion, is right up there with Tom Baker, and William Hartnell as great Doctors.<br /><br />13.  By the way, in another trailer the showed a look alike Doctor William Hartnell in the junk yard where it all started, but never saw him???  Bad teasing trailers to disappoint you after spending your $7.95 to watch the move length episode.<br /><br />And, there you have it, 13 complaints for 13 time-lords, btw, whatever happened to it was impossible for any Time-Lord to regenerate MORE than 12 times.  Hmmmm.

B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|An amazing talent that can pick up nearly any instrument and make it sing. This third album shows that she continues to improve and challenge herself. Great in concert and such a down to earth personality. Keep up the great work Sarah!!!
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Cute premise, decent cast, terribly boring. How could it have gone so wrong. You know it's bad when you fast forward through the climax...and then fast forward again through the touching (ha!) ending.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Well written thriller.  Hard to put down once you get started.  Look forward to reading all the books in the series.
B00D0OR5EC|3.0|I really liked the novel overall, but the breaks were so unique in each pause/chapter that sometimes it was hard to continue. I found myself taking various breaks, although, the novel was very short. The writing itself was deep and I found myself having to stew over each bit separately instead of plowing through. I do recommend it, but be warned, it is difficult to immerse yourself in this book.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|It made me aware of what it might be like to experience early onset Alzheimer's, and what it might be like to be a family member of a sufferer.
0316204366|4.0|Gladwell is a great thinker and writer, which makes it even more fun to argue wth him. His David and Goliath story is a great intro to thinkng differently, but in his attempt to make a point, ne blunders. He claims that Goliath had double vision brought on by a disease that also rendered him a giant. That's why, Gladwell tells us, that Goliath saw David holding two staffs, not one. Wouldn't he have seen two Davids, too? And wouldn't his brain have concluded that there was, in fact, one David and one stick?<br /> Still great fun to read.
B004FOA84A|2.0|No apparent logic to it.  The player just aimlessly touches objects in the various rooms until the appropriate &#34;tools&#34; are found. The game needs more discernible direction/motivations for the player to progress through the manor.
006202406X|1.0|So incredibly disappointed with this book. I absolutely LOVED the first two books. The message was great but I fell like Allegiant was not up to the same standards as the others. I'm not even complaining about the ending, like most people (even though I didn't like it). When I first saw that she was going to write from the views of Tris and Tobias, I was excited, hoping for a little more character development for Tobias. I was disappointed. I felt like the writing was lazy and it was essentially written in the same style as Tris. So, does that mean that they are the same people? No, of course not, but that's what it seemed to me. The book left more questions than it answered and some of the things I thought I would be excited to learn. Some characters were forgotten and left to die (literally and figuratively). I feel like she just was bored and tried to finish the novel before the Divergent movie came out.<br />Such a sad disappointment and I don't know if I really have a motivation to go see the movie after this book. All the spark was sucked out of me.<br /><br />Oh, and something else I thought of. Tris and Tobias' relationship seemed so much more... I don't know, unhealthy (?) in this book. I used to love their relationship BECAUSE it wasn't a love triangle like The Hunger Games was. Not that I expect all couples to have a bright and happy future, especially in this setting, but I couldn't understand their relationship at all in this one.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I really liked the third dairy of a wimpy kid book. It was the funniest thing that I saw in my life.T
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is very addicting. When I get stuck I wait a bit and try again.
B00E5N8DGG|3.0|Well, I can understand that many people liked it, it's a love or hate concert imho. Personally I didn't enjoy it much, Joe can't hit those high notes any longer and the way he tries to do it now using silly falsetto - sounds and looks weird. DTS-HD for 5.1 isn't great also - guitars could have been louder, especially Vivian's.<br />All in all - it's like watching some silly hollywood comedy, for example &#34;Last Vegas&#34; - good old actors and not their best perfomances, it gets more boring every 5 minutes. Oh, yes - there is an audience in concert, but it will take 30 minutes to notice it.
6305132984|5.0|Had fun watching it again.  Had no problems , gave a clear picture and sound.  It was nice to see Nathalie Wood.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addicting game to play and is also very fun.I definitely recommend this FREE game.<br />GET IT
B007EECSFA|5.0|One of the best books  I have read in a long time.  I would recommend this book without hesitation.  It is a good story line, well written, with a twist at the end that will really throw you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 4 year old likes it as much as I do! Great for horse lovers young and old! Try it
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Enjoyed the graphics. Sometimes tedious. Overall an enjoyable way to pass the time. I would play another one of their games.
1476727651|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King since I was a small child. I love this man. He has never failed in his ability to keep me intrigued with his writing.
B007NZQU72|5.0|This book helps you come to terms with your sensitivity and understand that all you have to do is to learn to give it due respect. As a result, life becomes more livable.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A difficult read at times because of its subject matter, but I would recommend it wholeheartedly except for that caveat.  The story is fiction, but loosely based on the author's autobiography.  This is one of the most unforgettable books I ever read.  The protagonist's constant self-examination and struggle to take the correct course, his attachment to the people he lives with in the Mumbai slums, and his trials, succcesses and failures make a compelling read.  It is almost unbelievable that a man could come out of an Australian prison and write with such command of the language and sensitivity to social issues.
B001QOGYFO|4.0|When I first saw the previews for Whiteout, I didn't think it would be anything special. It wasn't until Netflix recommended it for me and I read the description, that I thought there might be something there. While the previews made it look like some arctic nightmare, the truth is that it was a pretty great film. The story is centered around a U.S. Marshall, stationed at the base in Antarctica. For more than 3 years, she didn't really have much to do, but that all changed when two base members are found murdered. It then becomes Carrie Stetko's job to solve the first murders in the continents history. Despite a lack of other people and places to go, the writers of this film did an excellent job at keeping this movie intriguing. I didn't think in a million years that a film like this would work, but actually it works out really well, and unlike a similar story, Fargo, the producers of Whiteout hold nothing back. Kate Beckinsale stars and really does a fantastic job. I've always like her abilities, not to mention the way she looks, but this film is the first time her performance really stood out to me as something special, maybe she should consider playing a cop more often. As someone who's seen thousands of films, it always amazes me how the films I expect the least from, always deliver the biggest surprises. Whiteout is pure intensity, not to mention, a great mystery, that is absolutely worth seeing.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I have used the Withings Pulse for 3 days.  There are some good things about it: it is light and easy to read.  There are more bad things about it than good, however.  Getting the Pulse to read your heart rate is problematic--it is very picky about how you must put your finger on the sensor.  Sometimes I get it right away; other times I try 5 or 6 times and still can't get it to read (and more often than not, I can't get it to read).<br /><br />I bought the Pulse primarily for the sleep mode monitor.  You must put it into sleep mode at night and return it to normal mode when you get up in the morning.  This process involves getting it into the sleep menu by pushing the button and then sliding your finger to the left or right across the screen.  As with getting the Pulse to read your heart rate, sliding your finger across the screen seems to be something of an art.  It is certainly not easy to get the Pulse to register that you've slid your finger across, taking 5-6 attempts each time.  It doesn't seem to be pressure sensitive or slow/fast slide sensitive. But since it only rarely works, it's hard to tell just what you did to get it to register the swipe.<br /><br />I've also used a Jawbone Up bracelet for about 6 months (and was getting tired of it's rubber coating catching on sleeves, so thought I'd try the Pulse).  The readings between the two seem to be roughly the same (+/- 20%) for both steps and sleep patterns.  But the difficulty in getting the Pulse into sleep mode and back out is a real nuisance. The Up is very easy to put into sleep mode and it automatically figures out when you've woken up and are moving about for the day--but then the darned bracelet gets caught on shirt sleeves while dressing and undressing in the morning, changing for the gym, on coat sleeves, etc.  Which nuisance is more annoying will determine which I keep using, but I don't know which that is yet.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Closest to windows office. i looked at it and it should  do what i need it for. Mainly for lists of books and movies I collect.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Everyone needs this book in their life. Tina Fey is just absolutely brilliant. Funny as always, but even more relatable now. Just brilliant.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|Same as the Brachiosaurus good in size to others in the Papo line,the stance great and color not bad but they are using grey and green to much.We do know like reptiles now dinosaurs had to come in many colors.Now we are not saying anything flashy,only maybe around the face could have been to get a mates attention or ready to fight.Some may have done this on spin plates to.But here I go giving science again,back to the Ankylosaurus figure.It is the best figure out there,only by way of a good model or a statue can you do better.Also again it would cost to a lot more.This Papo figure is a great looker and I don't think anyone could beat the price Amazon had.If Amazon still has the Papo Brachiosaurus and Ankylosaurus I say  YES! Do not think about it if you have been looking,buy them from them.I would say also to look at their price on other Papo dinosaurs they have.If these were such a good price others must be to.The shipping was good and timely.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|ILove sewing so thought it was worth a try. This game is WONDERFUL! I recommend it for anyone who wants to pass time with a smile.
B007CF7L9O|5.0|It is the best out in form as to how it should have been like.Maybe very light scaling should have been added to, instead off it having just tough skin like a rino etc.But it works.Others figures I have seen don't do it justice,except one as big by Safari LTD.did for Carnegie sometime back.But they got the feet wrong and neck could have been thicker.Schleich does some some good dinosaurs and did almost as big a Brachiosaurus but the head was funny looking,they have sized down their big ones and repainted their Brachiosaurus looks better but having sized down I don't think Schleich is worth it anymore for they still cost the same.CollectA does a good size but is even more funny looking.They did it with pebble like scales but not lightly and the look on its face forget it.But there are many good dino's CollectA has done.Getting back this is the best Brachiosaurus figure and its by Papo.To do better you would have to go into models and statues and this would start in the hundred to more dollar range.The Papo  Brachiosaurus was a good price for Amazon.I thank you.
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|Overview:<br />I had to notch this rating down to 3 because this was definitely not up to typical DT standards.  It almost goes without saying for anybody that knows DT, the songs and artistic musicianship are not of this world.  These guys are like music Olympians.  I've been a follower of DT since '97, own every album, and have multiple DVDs and been to 10+ concerts.  They are all of exceptional quality, and this one does not follow for some reason.  It's a little painful to write anything bad about my favorite band, but I must swallow my pride.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The video is very nice in HD.  I like the setlist.  It was nice to see &#34;6:00&#34; done live as I have never seen this song performed live.  You don't hear much from the &#34;Awake&#34; album.  Speaking of the &#34;Awake&#34; album, &#34;Caught In a Web&#34; is available on the bonus tracks and &#34;The Silent Man&#34; is done acoustically with a string quartet.  I think this is one of the highlights, since you don't get to see this side of DT very often.  There was also a song (A Fortune In Lies) on there that, I'm guessing, is a either very very old or a new bonus song, because I've never heard this song before.  Where did this come from?<br /><br />This is the first tour with new drummer, Mike Mangini.  This guy is a machine and you will be impressed by the drum solo.<br /><br />Bonus features are also done well and always enjoy the behind the scenes.  A little on the short side for me.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />My short stoner version would be... dude? c'mon man.<br />I just can't believe how off balance the mix is.  How did this happen?  The guitars and vocals are very hot, keyboard very weak and the bass.... well, that almost doesn't exist!  Drums seem ok.  This is highly disappointing for me.  It's bad enough to where I wouldn't show this to people that are seeing DT for the first time.  &#34;Live at Budokon&#34; and &#34;Score&#34; are much better live DVDs for the mix.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />It is an enjoyable DVD and worth having for a DT fan, but just be prepared to barely hear Mr. Rudess on the keyboard and Mr. Myung on bass.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|its to hard i chose ambush and biowar i have reinstalled the game but any robot i play as it doesnt make it any easier P.S im playing on amazon kindle fire hd
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|The first word that popped into my head at the end of this book was charming. I'm in a book club that makes me read books out of my comfort zone and in this case I am not disappointed. There were many laugh out loud moments as well as thought provoking banter between the main characters Rosie and Don. I never read love stories but found this book so enjoyable I can't wait to read the sequel. Take a chance on this book, you won't be disappointed!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best and fastest books I have read in a long time. Recommend it to everyone. Good luck
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I started playing it last year and can't get enough of it.  It has your typical glitches like most games, but it has new updates all the time that enhance game play and keeps it exciting.  The alliance is awesome because you aid others around the world in becoming successful at their own game and the favor is returned.  Great creators and very imaginative writers n developers.  I only wish it was compatible with my current phone too
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|love thier music, every song has its own appeal looking forward to ore music from them, hope they keep it coming out sooner than later
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|Really, a great fun game. Had been playing, made it to the last world. My Nexus 10 updated to Android 4.4,and now the game fails to load. Game needs an update, soon!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I really liked the game. It had a good story and kept my interest. Good graphics, too. It was very nice to be able to reach &#34;The End.&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|They should put all the things in minecraft in this game like horse's,saddles,dog's,cats,octopus ,and you can go to the nether.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really like wonder because the action never ends. I liked what happened in the end. That is why I rated it 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its a great gmae with a levels that become tough but fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who like the type of game with levels in it.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I was impressed by the way this story unfolded.  I already played it twice.  I really don't know how you writers or should I call you creatures, actual come up with so m ideas.  I have enjoyed it ever so much.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I put off watching this movie because I read several poor rating. I was pleasantly surprised when I did watch the movie. Reading the book did help with my understanding of the movie but I would still recommend it as a good science fiction story.
B00B125QRS|4.0|I am very pleased with my cd order. I love all of these albums included in this set. I received them about a week after I ordered them. The only negative thing I could possibly say is that the cover is slightly smashed  in on one corner of the lower side but  damage isn't that bad. Thank you for a good ordering experience.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. I think it's because you are always adding items to the game so it's constantly changing. My only complaint is that I wish story mode of this game would never end!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game it's like you don't have to take up all that space for all those games
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I liked the characters in this book, however, I had a hard time finishing it. I kept waiting for something to interesting to happen and only finished it because I was so far into it that I had to know who the killer was.  I'm glad it was free.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game!  Way better than the original.  Also enjoy the fact you don't have to play with friends if you just want a game to play on your own.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Didn't want it to end This is the second time I woke up tonight and read and now it's over.  Put this book down only when I fell asleep. Too easy of a read had to check if it was a child's book, that's ok once in a while.
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|It's a case, it works, protects the phone. It is prone to scratching under heavy usage. All in all a good stylish case.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|Wow, it was a drag to finish this book. But I wanted to finish reading this book to see why it won the Pulitzer prize.  North korea is a country cloaked in mystery. But that does not allow anyone to write a story about the country from his imagination and depict it much evil than it is.  How much does author truly know about North Korea? The concept of replacement husband was so far fetched and ridiculous, I could only laugh. Even the names of the koreans the author used are not korean names. Q-kee, jujak? These are korean names? As a korean, I am very offended that the author makes up a story misleading readers as if these are thing that really go on in North Korea. And shame on Pulitzer committe to select a book like this as the winner of Pulitzer prize.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This is a great tool for beginners. It really helps you to over learn and therefore remember the vocab, verb conjugations and phrases. Grammar is learned through osmosis. It allows practice in the four areas of language acquisition: listening, reading, speaking and writing. I really liked the speaking practices.<br /><br />However, the use of the same vocab for all activities really became boring....more variety is needed.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the most beautiful book. It transports you to nazi Germany through the colourful eyes of death. The book thief creates a landscape so vividly it is like a painting and a memory at the same time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet is master of the historical novel, weaving plots around history, but making history personal. Great book! Must read for anyone who loves history!
1455576387|5.0|It took me about 100 pages to warm up to this story, but after that, I couldn't put it down. I liked it so much I am in the process of buying and reading all other books by David Baldacci. The story about the former secret service officer kept me guessing the whole time, and I cared about the main characters—I thought they were well drawn and the dialogue believable. I don't want to give anything away  in this review, but will say that it really did keep me guessing, and was a fun, fast read. I thoroughly loved it.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, was surprised that IMDB rated it so low. I'd say its akin to the men and black movies.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Talk about late into the party. I just realized that this is a huge book with a huge fanbase once I researched about it. Honestly this is one of the books where I just discover it by it having a movie adaptation. (Coming this November, I am really excited)<br /><br />So, now I want to put so many superlatives for this book. I seriously consider this as one of the best book I've read in my entire life. The pacing was spot on. The author really takes you on to a roller coaster rider of emotions because you can't help but empathize with Ender in his journey towards the book. And also some powerful emotion and situation for a child. I really really like the story of the book.<br /><br />Also don't be put off with it being Sci-Fi genre. There's not a lot of weird terminology where you don't understand half the things they are saying. In fact I think some political terms are much more confusing for me than the Sci-Fi stuff.<br /><br />The characters are likeable. They each serve their own purpose in the book and even thought there's a lot I feel like they are used brilliantly and appropriately in accordance to the overall story.<br /><br />The ending is also good. In the back of your head I feel like you have an idea that it will happen but when you read it, it still comes as a shock and surprise. So that ending!!!! Ahhhhhhhhh!<br /><br />All in all I really love this book and how it all comes together. I am excited to see it in movie form. I just wish they just handled the adaptation really well. I suggest read the book first before watching the movie.<br /><br />I give this book 5 whales.
B00846REIS|5.0|WOW!! Intense page turner. Thought is was going to be a 50 Shades copy-cat, but it is far from it...it is more of a love story.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|A good way to waste some time without it becoming too engrossing. Some crops involved but more to the game than that. Really an enjoyable way to spend some extra time on your hands.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun to play! Its addicting and hard to put down. It is also great at passing time and taking away boredom.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun, but not great. Run out of moves. Time waster. Some lbs are really tough, challenging, guess that makes it fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this is one of the best ever! Right up there with \\"A Time To Kill\\". Can't wait for the next one.
