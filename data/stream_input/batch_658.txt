1572814349|4.0|This is my first tarot deck. I like the images on the cards, they are beautiful - I would not have known they were collages of Renaissance art unless I had read the book. My only complaint is that the cards are heavy and are a bit difficult to shuffle. Otherwise, a great deck!!
B000H0MKGK|2.0|I was bemoaning the death of the guitar in pop music in a conversation with friends and as a result of this conversation, I received this CD as a gift.  With all the hype regarding the record, I was expecting to be blown out of the water.  In stead, I was left shrugging. <br /> <br />To be fair, Mayer has some good guitar hooks and occasionally interesting lyrics.  However, if you're a person who has listened to music for any period of time, what Mayer has done in the record isn't anything that hasn't been done before.  If you have heard Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughn, you've heard this stuff before, but done much better. <br /> <br />My first problem with the record is that this was not a spontaneous artistic breakout or the discovery of a great artist who's been under the radar.  Rather, this is a glaring example of pre-packaged, calculated 'maturity.'  Mayer suddenly has long hair, is in dramatic artist poses: all the basic requirements for a rock star.  His lyrics on the first listen seem to strive for profundity, but with a second listen, the phrasing seems to be nothing but trite line after line.  All of it seems so artifically cool that I was left feeling I'd drunk a can of diet soda: my stomach was filled, but I got nothing out of it. <br /> <br />The second problem is that the record's songs all sound the same.  On the first song, you sort of nod and go, not bad guitar work.  The second song, you think, okay, this is his sound.  By the fifth song, you wonder if any of the songs sound any differently.  When I got to the sixth track, I began to click through the CD to see if there was anything faster, harder on the record, different... but there isn't. It's all sort of slightly less than mid-tempo to slow to even slower tempo.  What can be said is the record is model of consistency: if you like the same song and sound over and over, buy it.  If you like an artist that can go harder in one song, go ballad in another, go anthem style in a third, don't get this record. <br /> <br />The best I could figure, he's getting attention because he looks young but has a voice that sounds like he's a 40 something bluesman.  Were he a battered looking person of color, I think the album wouldn't have gotten a mention.  That and Jessica Simpson is dating him.  In short, this record is what is wrong with music: bland, no risk taking and pre-packaged. <br />
1582701709|1.0|I am not surprised at how well this book is doing.  What ever happened to hard, honest work -and- a positive mental attitude?  I did not become a physical therapist by willing it to happen.  I worked diligently for almost 6 years -and- kept a positive attitude throughout my schooling.  I  <br />earned my degree.   <br /> <br />For one, do people honestly believe that by eating any kind of food you want you become fat and unhealthy only because your think that the food will cause you to be that way?  What has the scientific community said after years of research?  If I am not mistaken, eating whatever you want can cause weight gain, diabetes, heart disease and many other illnesses.  Why can't we maintain a positive attitude, EAT HEALTHY and EXERCISE??  What is this country coming to?  Work hard and think positively and not only will you lose weight but you'll feel better too!  Largely and for the most part, things don't fall in your lap because you will them to.  <br />  <br />If I had known it was this easy to sell a motivational book, I would have written one a long time ago (but it probably wouldn't sell, because no one likes to hear that they have to work hard for something).  And yes, I recognize that I just stated something negative about my book selling ability.  This is complete and utter nonsense. <br /> <br />By the way, there were dozens of people before Ms. Byrne who have written much of the same thing.  People just like to hear this version because they don't have to do anything for it except think about it and will it to happen.  Additionally, what does she really know about Plato ??  My significant other is working on his PhD in philosophy and has done extensive reading and writing on the Platonic corpus. and I have never heard him talk about Plato using \\"The Secret\\".  Perhaps he was a very positive thinker,  but he also happened to be a brilliant man with phenomenal ideas and concepts.
B000NA22C6|5.0|Okay that other guy who reviewed this is insane as H.  <br /> <br />This movie is awesome.  Johnny Depp gives a brilliant performance as author Mort Rainey.  If you read the book then you know the story and hopefully you also know that movies won't ever be completely the same as the book.  So don't be mad at the movie just get used to it.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|im very happy to see will do such a great movie filled with heart and a great cast..this is one of the better comedy/drama's of the year its in my top 15 of 06'. if u like punch drunk love you will like this.<br /><br />dustin hoffman is also great in this film.<br /><br />  very good film and a great screenplay about a man who is written in a book and he doesnt know if the autor is gonna kill him and save him!!<br /><br />great movie thats all i can tell u about the plot.
B00004RJ74|5.0|Quentin Tarrantino wrote the script to this movie so it was no surprise to me at how good this movie was.  Director Robert Rodriguez shines with this brilliant mix of bank robbers gone survivalists.  Quentin Tarrantino gives a great performance in this film as an effen nut/bank robber.  The movie starts out with a hostage situation and then goes from more kidnapping and hostage taking to a bloody fight for survival against some pretty cool looking vampires in Mexico.  Salma Hayek is awesome.  I mean it.. just watch the bar scene with her little dance routine.  Give this movie a chance and see it.  Love It Live It....
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This is a fun soundtrack.  Most of the tracks are performed by Hugh Grant.  I didn't know he could sing so well.  My favorite track is Don't Write Me Off.  This track shows off his talent as a singer and his skills on the piano.  Way Back Into Love is another highlight on this soundtrack.  Hugh performs this song as a duet two times  on this CD with different partners,  and they both sound very good to me.  Pop Goes My Heart is an upbeat tune that gets me moving.  Meaningless Kiss and Dance With Me Tonight are two other tracks that stand out.  Hugh's voice has a romantic quality on these songs.  Haley Bennett is the other surprise on this soundtrack.  The songs Buddha's Delight and Entering Booty Town are very sensual.  Music and Lyrics is the best movie soundtrack of 2007 so far.
B0009UC810|4.0|I have both Blues Brother's VHSes - I enjoy the Blues Brothers so much I just had to update my VHS. I don't know why it tickles my funny bone, but part of my enjoyment is the music. The 2 CDs I have don't correspond with the DVD music; I wish it did.  <br /> <br />I'm a native born Chicago female; I think that has something to do with my enjoyment. I think I understand what the Blues Brothers were portraying: the car wrecks/crash and general psychology of the time, I get it.  <br /> <br />If you're a Chi-town type person and like blues music, but not only the blues, This ALB will have you slapping your knees, seeing it as a comedy.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Very few singers today have earned the right to be called a true \\"artist.\\" Enter: Corrine Bailey Rae. Her voice is inspiring and her songs are from the heart. There is usually at least one song on any album that I just skip over but with this CD,I played and enjoyed every song from beginning to end. I love it!!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I happened upon this ALB elsewhere and took a chance on it.  <br /> <br />I've been a Country/RnR fan for most of my life and newer music is getting too much, for me, into hip-hop and rap, etc.  <br /> <br />I'm looking for \\"the blues\\" and listen to NPR to get clues as to what artist's the blues encompass.  <br /> <br />Eric Clapton's Crossroads DVD was just the ticket for me. Now I want a CD of the music to make my own mix. <br /> <br />Before I watched the DVD I played it as a CD. Disk one I have no complaints with, just superb. Disk 2, the first three compositions weren't my cup of tea, musically, although I recognized the talent. I forgave it and moved on. It is to be a classic, if only the DVD were better known. I do know I want more Robert Cray, Johnny Lang and John Mayer. Joe Walsh must be wonderful to hang with; what a human. <br /> <br />I have CDs with some of the music and in the concert it was done even better. Eric, give us a CD - I'll buy it.
0783225849|5.0|It took me this many years to finally catch Psycho. This film is awesome!!! This film is so legendary, I had already known the ending without ever seeing it, but I was still amazed and taken off guard.  <br /> <br />This movie is a must see!
B000GUJF4G|1.0|You may want to skip this version.  Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Roddy MacDowell, the recently departed Red Buttons and the incredible Gene Hackman made the original disaster film memorable, fun and exciting.  Special effects have come a long way since then but I was very disappointed with the new film.  I adore Richard Dreyfuss but I thought his skills were wasted in this film.  The originial story line was much more exciting and I remember being on the edge of my seat watching it in the theater. <br /> <br />I wasn't able to see the latest in a theater and I'll admit that may have jaded my opinion some.  It's definitely the kind of movie best viewed on the big screen.  Whether you enjoyed this film or not, I'd still suggest that you rent the original.  It's a classic in the disaster genre of that time.
1582701709|3.0|While it is a pleasant and uplifting experience, discovering the Law of Attraction \\"revealed\\" in The Secret does not give one everything that is needed to find complete peace and satisfaction. The 3-step creative process of the \\"ask, believe, receive\\" philosophy is not alone enough. <br />In order to find peace and satisfaction, one must make a value-driven use of life's precious resources. Nonetheless, there is still much good to be said for the snippets tied together as The Secret as it flows into what I describe in my own book, Great! All the Time!, as the marshalling of life's precious resources to do the right thing. <br />The Secret restricts itself to predominantly channel all of one's energy into feeling good so that the good things you want will attract themselves to you. It limits itself only to using the resource of energy. There are, however, as I describe them, eight types of life's precious resources: self, time, effort, energy, emotion, intellect, property, and people. All eight of these resources must be marshalled in a coordinated fashion to do the right thing. <br />The author spends a great deal of her energy on visualization the \\"what\\" one wants and giving it up to the collateral energy of the universe to figure out the \\"how\\" that will attract it to you. Visualization, however, is only the first step in my own P10 Principle - that perception, planning, preparation, practice, persistence, and patience promote practically perfect performance. There are six steps in doing the right thing and The Secret's power of visualization is only the first step in finding the peace and satisfaction that we all seek and to which we are all entitled. <br />I was delighted, however, that The Secret did not just dwell on obtaining the material pleasures of life. It does not, however, spend enough time or space on how to do the actual work required to do the right thing. It mainly speaks in terms of thinking about what one wants instead of seeing a bigger picture ofwhat the world needs.  <br />All in all, however, it is a good beginning to doing the right thing. It is a way to at least open the door and go out that and be Great! All the Time! <br />
B00004W50T|5.0|Eric Clapton in the liner notes of Blind Faith's deluxe edition sums it up when he described this album as having the most significant impact on him \\"whose versatility and harmonious unity seemed blissfully free of the corrosive intensity which had fueled Cream\\".<br /><br />Furthermore, The Band's melodic interplay and the subtle textures created by their exotic instruments whose close association with Bob Dylan only deepened his(Clapton's) fascination. No need to add words BUT all the bonus tracks, Basement Tape versions are grand fully reproduced in these high caliber remasters artwork and all.
B000LC55F2|3.0|This film is OK but not Great.  Had I not seen the film I wouldn't have missed much.  I like Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman so I wanted to like this film very much.  But it didn't work for me. <br />The two main characters (Bale and Jackman) were pretty immoral, selfish, self absorbed and cold.  It made it hard for me to really care about either.  However Christian's character seemed to be a bit more surly, dishonest and disloyal. <br />The film seemed to choose in the end that Christian's character was the better man and better magician.  I didn't see it. <br />The magic in the film was, as another reviewer wrote, redundant.  Both magicians performed the same tricks using different methods. <br />Some of the plots twists and turns were a bit of a let down too. <br />The film did leave room for a Prestige 2.  Which I would \\"rent\\" in hopes that the second film would be better then the first. <br />
B00006JKON|5.0|This is a thematic album of songs about life as war and survival..with London's WW 2 bombings heard in the background as the husband declines the 2nd cup of tea, women of leisure seeking a living, the exploits of an aggressive colonial power heard in Queen & Country, the certitude of skating away on life's thin ice, Living in society is alas living in the jungle, and you balance the world on the tip of your nose...Coming after Passion's Play, these songs are well constructed mini pieces.<br /><br />The sound of these remasters are great, and now with the inclusion of Rainbow Blues, classical instrumentals,alternative versions this becomes a wonderful CD that stands up to the test of time..I saw this \\"War Child\\" tour at Madison Square Garden and vividly remember Ian Anderson parading around the dark lights as the bombs were exploding around him ushering in a very good time for music.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|I really didn't like this movie much although the acting was outstanding.  Some actors definitely deserved academy award nominations for having to portray unscrupulous and perhaps mentally unbalanced characters.  There are 3 movies in one in various locations around the world that have a connection.  The movie was slow to get started and I just became impatient with the bad decisions most of characters were making.  It was pretty easy to figure out the bad results.  I felt sorry for and disgusted by some of the characters and some prolonged and continual scenes were unnecessary.  I don't think I needed to continually see a particular characters nudity (We get it).  Even though it was just acting, the amount of time the director spent on filming a child masturbating made me feel like this must be what child pornography is about.    I guess the point the film was trying to make was about miscommunication.  What a long unpleasant road it took to get there.    If you have to see it \\"rent\\" it.
1582701709|1.0|It is no surprise that thinking positively, envisioning what you'd like, making goals to reach your dreams, and then working hard to achieve them is bound to engender more success than thinking negatively, being directionless and lazy.  That's not a secret, it's just logic.  However, this book takes positive, proactive living to a silly, ridiculous level.  The idea that the bad things that happen in life happen because a person \\"attracted\\" them is arrogant, cruel, and dangerous.  And for the people for whom the \\"secret\\" doesn't work?  The people selling this - and that's what it is; sales pitch - would say that it is that person's own fault because they didn't believe enough.  What a convenient excuse.  It allows them to utterly avoid culpability or scrutiny.  There's nothing new here - just old snake oil in new bottles.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I read both positive and negative reviews here about \\"Love\\" so when I put the CD in my player I was hoping for something likeable--but expecting to be disappointed. <br /> <br />I was blown away.  \\"Love\\" is a brilliant CD that far exceeded by expectations. The more familiar you are with the Beatles' music, the more you'll appreciate it.  The brightest of MANY highlights is the \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" triology--George and Giles Martin outdid themselves by taking music from each of the songs and blending them into one--not three songs that lead in sequence into the other, but one unique song with music and lyrics from all 3.  This technique is used throughout the CD, especially notably with \\"Get Back\\". <br /> <br />Since this technique worked so well, I was let down a bit in hearing \\"Yesterday\\", which remains mostly unchanged.  Perhaps the Martins figured it was too perfect to be messed with and should speak for itself.  <br /> <br />This is NOT a CD to buy if you're just getting interested in The Beatles and looking to start a collection.  However, if you've been a fan for (mumble) years, this is a GREAT way to refresh your relationship with them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LXH0AE|4.0|The movie was like watching a Dr. Suess movie for the first hour until he visits the actual writer of the book. <br />This movie is woth the watching time .
B000I5X81A|5.0|I have seen Eric Clapton in concert several times: Money and Cigarettes tour, with Mark Knopfler, Forever Man tour. Over the years I have been quite the fan, but not so much in recent years. Then I hear the song Danger on a local radio station and figure it's a tune from the Clapton/Cale CD. A few days later I hear yet another song. Loved 'em both. So I bought the CD and absolutely love it. Billy Preston (RIP) is a big-time contributor on several of the songs. Honestly, I can see myself listening to this CD quite a bit over the coming months. It's a 5-star item in my book.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel isn't so much about plot. It's really about understanding one another in a world that is full of difference and inequality. The film is a collection of very loosely intertwined narratives that debate the same theme; how this world seems deaf and blind to its true problems. <br /> <br />In the first narrative, we have two Americans (Pitt and Blanchette) traveling abraod. When the woman is shot, terrorists are immediately blamed. Now, stuck in this country - and in the middle of a political war - Pitt has to try and deal with his wife's faith. Problem is, we, the viewers, know that this was not a terrorist attack but truly a prank gone bad, as the woman was shot by two pre-teen boys trying out their father's rifle. Their narrative is also revealed and the impact of their action is sad and shocking.  <br /> <br />Back in America, a Mexican nanny wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico. But she is stuck with the two American kids is cares for. Deciding to bring them to her son's wedding is a mistake since, upon coming back into the US, she is accused of having kidnapped the kids since she is Mexican and has trouble communicating with the boarder patrol. This is by far the best narrative in this film. There is a scene where the woman runs away in the desert with the children. As she gets lost, you can see the fear growing in her, until she can no longer control everything she is feeling.  <br /> <br />Finally, in Asia, a young deaf woman only wants to be loved. But because she lacks communication skills, no one understands her basic needs. The fact that no one understands her and, in a way, that she doesn't understand her own self makes her one of the saddest characters I've seen on screen in a while. <br /> <br />In the end, all these storylines are link. But this is not the important thing in this movie. This movie is about silence and about understanding through images and actions. The narrative is slow at times, but I liked the way the film took its time totell its story. There is rarely a dull moment in Babel and the emotional punch strikes you right in the gut and steals your breath away.  <br /> <br />Babel really had an impact on me. After watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I highly recommended this film to anyone who enjoyed the director's previous efforts. A true gem.
1582701709|1.0|Nothing more than a modern day snake oil salesman!  This book is so dangerous on so many levels it's scary!  <br /> <br />I'm paralyzed from the waist down after a terrible car accident in '95 when I was only 15 years old, I just recently had my 26th birthday in my wheelchair. I've seen everything from ministers to Asian monks looking for help, but all attempts were futile. After visiting with several quirky self proclaimed healers I decided to give up, I am happy in my wheelchair and do not need to be given false hope. So for the last 7 years I have not sought out \\"healers\\" of any sort, but when a best selling book claims it can make me walk, then I'm definitely giving it a shot.  <br /> <br />So I bought the book and the DVD both, I listened to it's advice, I did what it said. Nothing! Nada! This book, \\"The Secret,\\" claims that with positive thinking and visualizations, the mind will heal the body. It gives certain steps and instructions on how to visualize what you are attempting to achieve, in my case I would have to picture myself walking, then with enough positive reinforcement it would literally happen. Well it didn't! The book is attractive because of the way it is worded, it speaks with a very scientific vocabulary, mainly quantum mechanics, a new and very misunderstood science that is in it's infancy. Don't be fooled by this book, I know it is enticing, but be rational like many of us other suckers were not.  <br /> <br />IF IT WEREN'T FOR OPRAH THIS BOOK WOULDN'T HAVE SOLD A SINGLE COPY! However Oprah lost her credibility with A million little Pieces by James Frey who was the ultimate con man. Well, Oprah again misleads her audience with the \\"The Secret\\" . <br /> <br />The only secret here is that Rhonda Byrne is laughing all the way to the bank! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000M5AJQS|4.0|There are too many mob movies out there. Most of them aren't worth your while, but once in a blue moon, a great one is produced. Scorsese is no stranger to mob movies. And The Departed presents the director in top shape. Based on the incredible asian movie Infernal Affairs, The Departed is a wonderful film. <br /> <br />This is really a story of mistaken identity. One cop (Dicaprio) infiltrates the chicago mob under a false identity in order to try and bring them down. But the ways of the mob - their violence, their way of thinking - is slowly impregnating his own mind. Meanwhile, one of the mob's own (Damon) infiltrates the police and can now tell the mob their every actions. <br /> <br />After a while, you don't even know who's good and who's bad anymore. The film presents this violent world in a very realistic way. Damon falls in love with a woman who can never truly trust him. And that woman falls in love with Dicaprio, who will never fully trust her either. Trust seems to be a huge issue in this narrative. <br /> <br />Some things bug me about this movie. Its running time is rather long (the original movie, which has every plot point presented in the American version, was almost an hour shorter and it is, in fact, better). The story sometimes takes too long to unveil. And I have a big problem with Jack Nicholson. Playing the mob boss, he seems to think that being disgusting and crazy will make his performance great. In fact, it's truly annoying at times. As times goes by, it seems that Nicholson is becoming less of an actor and becoming more of a walking joke.  <br /> <br />But Dicaprio and especially Damon save this movie. Supported with strong performances by Sheen and Whalberg, The Departed is a violent and often funny dark film that gives you exactly what you wanted.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Not the best of TNG movies by far, this one is never the less entertaining. More like an episode of the series than an actual motion picture, I personally believe the script should be blamed as the director, Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker himself) did an amazingly wonderful job on the previous entry in the series, Star Trek: First Contact. The film suffers from a lack of a significant and powerful villain. Never the less, there's a lot of fun to be had here. The crew seems more like a family again.
0385336691|4.0|I picked up my first Lee Child (audio) book at the library, and really enjoyed the character Jack Reacher and the adventure he ensues after he casually re-visits a New York City coffeeshop one evening. Although the script plots out like a \\"super-tough guy\\" comic book, somehow the author makes it all work for me.<br /><br />Dick Hill does a great job with the audio book. Looking forward to finding my next Jack Reacher adventure! 4 stars!
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Stranger than Fiction is basically everything Click wasn't. While that film was basically a typical Adam Sandler vehicle for fart and dog-humping-stuff jokes, this film has more of an accessible tone but a heart as well. It's cheesy to say since there's always films that \\"have a heart\\" even when they're just soulless moneysucking fodder. Much ado had been talked about for Will Ferrell's first dramatic role and while I wouldn't say he's the best performance, he's probably the most surprising and the whole film taken as a whole is a good date rental. <br /> <br />Harold Crick is a IRS agent with straight routines: brushes his teeth a specific amount of times and walks to the bus in specific number of steps. But then he notices that what he's doing is being narrated by a voice in his head. Voice turns out to be troubled author Kay Eiffel who's writing her latest book. With the help of a literature professor, Harold has to locate Kay before she writes her ending: Harold's death. <br /> <br />While Ferrell does a commendable job, strangely it's Emma Thompson who stole the show for me. Troubled but having an odd sense of humor as well, including one scene where she needs inspiration from \\"surely dead\\" people. We also have Dustin Hoffman, cutie Maggie Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah as Kay's assistant and Tony Hale (Buster from Arrested Development) as Harold's friend, Dave. Even Amadeus himself, Tom Hulce, shows up as a cameo. Unlike certain films that try to stock as much name actors as possible (coughs*Oceans Eleven*coughs), these work as characters and don't distract anyone. <br /> <br />Too bad the extra features are kind of lame. These are basically \\"this was so great to work on, he's so talented\\" interviews and you don't really get any insight into making it, it's just a bunch of people talking about how cool the movie is. One thing I should mention is that this isn't really one of those knee-slapper comedies where there's joke after another. Some comedies have that kindof go-for-broke quality where they will use whatever they can to make sure the audience laughs while this is more geared to a more relaxed crowd that likes a couple funny parts thrown in. <br /> <br />I don't know if it's worth buying but if you've got a special someone, it'd make a great date movie. Don't know if it's enough to get you something even more special afterwards though.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|I watched this movie after a couple weeks of been released, it made me cry, it's also very inspirational.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I saw this show live in Los Angeles...What can I say that the others have not? She is simply the greatest entertainer of our time. The show is flawless, amazing, beautiful, powerful...buy this DVD/CD and marvel at her amazing talent...believe me, nobody does it better than Madonna...NOBODY.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is simply hilarious. You will make a connection between the movie, and your own job, no matter what your occupation. All I can say is, if you haven't seen it, you should.
0743289412|3.0|Learning this book had been released, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  When my husband gave me a gift certificate for my birthday, I thought it would be most fitting to buy a love story from one of my favorite authors.  The story started out well enough, and other reviewers have already given enough of the plot away, so I won't, but for some reason it just didnt' keep my interest.  I found myself yearning to begin another book.  This would have been unthinkable  with any of his previous writings.  I gobbled them all up like long anticipated birthday cake.  I can't put my finger on why exactly it lagged, but I think the story just didn't support 500 plus pages.  Although it was a good story with likable good guys and dreadful bad ones,it just wasn't great.
B000H5U65C|2.0|Watching the creation of the music on the DVD showed me why this left me cold.  It wasn't performed, rather it was assembled in the studio.  As such, its an exercise in high-tech recording techniques and currently-fashionable metal stylings.  The songs are disjointed in construction, and lacking the organic wholeness and grooviness required to make heavy music great.  I don't know how it was created, but Leviathan was a much more engaging listen.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I give this stars not based on providing deep insight into the science of global warming, but rather as an superb demonstration of creative speech writing and Power Point pitching.  After watching this film, I can see what a brilliant politician Mr. Gore is, and how much he must have learned from working with Bill Clinton for 8 years.  That being said, Al Gore should be detested by the world for posing as a scientist in this film.  <br /> <br />Working for a world class non-profit research institution myself, alarms ring in my head the moment I see charts and slide presented in the manner if Mr. Gore.  These multimedia presentations that elicit a response based on impressing the senses rather than conveying scientific research in the form of scientific method.  I could refer you to countless web sites that demonstrate that the data he presents here is not sound scientific proof of global warming being caused by people.  That's not to say global warming is not caused by people, but I would take the skeptic side and say \\"lets see some real science behind this that go beyond pretty but meaningless charts & graphs\\".  Likewise, I do believe we should cut down on fossil fuel use, but not necessarily for the reasons conveyed by AG.  Rather, strategically, it seems more important to ween ourselves off our dependency of the oil cartel from a national security standpoint. <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers who resent the Academy for rewarding this type of film making (in the manner of in Michael Moore), rather than practicing good journalism/documentary making.  I would not consider myself a moderate, and find it deplorable that the Academy will favors films that have extreme left political agendas. <br /> <br />On a side note, it is entertaining how every person Al Gore works with is his \\"friend\\", meaning he has millions of really tight buddies.  A person like you or me would probably refer to one of these as a colleague, since they aren't somebody we go and grab a beer with every Tuesday night. <br /> <br />In all, this film is a joke; a funny one at that, so I give it 3 stars.
0312937385|5.0|I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones. <br /> <br />The general pattern in the whole series is: <br />The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans. <br />Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark): <br /> <br />Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10) <br /> <br />Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant) <br /> <br />Shadow of the Giant: (see below) <br /> <br />Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more \\"space\\" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10) <br /> <br />Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9) <br /> <br />Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9) <br /> <br />Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones). <br /> <br />Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10). <br /> <br />Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, \\"that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...\\", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.  <br />* The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and, <br />* The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9) <br /> <br />In general, both series have three categories of good stuff: <br />1) Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc) <br />2) Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure <br />3) In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etc <br />And two main bad stuff: <br />1) Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series). <br />2) One of the alien species described in the Ender series wasso too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism... <br />Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings \\"katharsis\\" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full \\"katharsis\\". <br />
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I live in the UK and had this item shipped over, and what an item it is! Every episode ever of this amazing TV show cased in a truly exception box. With detailed design work in gold card, the box is really quite heavy so adds to the illusion that it is infact gold. The lid doesnt simply just pull off, but uses a method of magnets to keep the sides secure. The individual seasons are well packaged, although i am wondering about the possibility of damage to the disks as there is none of that 'soft material' in the slip cases to avoid scratches. This box set has extra special features that were not included in the original box sets including an indepth documentary looking back at the history of the show with the stars! The UK version of this set is simply a large box with the previouse five boxsets wedged into it....... so to any fellow europeans (or anybody reading this), BUY THIS VERSION! it's much better. This set is also limited to 40,000 editions, so get it while you can! Definatly my favourite purchase this year so far....

6305268843|5.0|So passionate and beautiful. I have seen this film about 4 times since 2002 and have been looking to buy the the DVD ever since and could not find it anywhere. I finally got the DVD here from Amazon (it was shipped from Hong Kong) and watched it again last night, and I am still deeply moved. The acting is just superb and you can feel every little emotion (and passion!) from actors, Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane. I am so disappointed that it is not released here in the US, I wonder if it will ever be released. This is such a precious gem and I am telling everyone I know to see it.
6305161879|5.0|For the fan of classic Cleese, you will not be disappointed.  This movie is blessed with a spectacular cast and a superb script.  The comic timing and sheer talent of the cast, make this one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is difficult to describe without resorting to spoilers.  One thing I will say, however, is that this film has made an indellible impact on my family.  Hardly a family gathering will go by, without someone saying, \\"Oh do shut up, Porche!\\"  Some of the most hilarious scenes, in my opinion, are between Otto (Kevin Kline) and Ken (Micheal Palin).  Strangely, even though the character's are supposed to be a band of thieves, you can't help but almost root for this gang of underdogs.  Speaking of Dogs, some of the scenes may not appeal to animal lovers.  However, these scenes are handled in a fairly cartoonish and very \\"Monty Python\\" fashion, so I don't think they will insult the sensibilities of most viewers.  This movie was given an R rating, mostly for dialog and a brief view of Cleese's buttocks, but I doubt that it would even receive a PG-13 rating now.  While it is not a movie I'd recommend for young children, as the humor is likely to be over their heads, I recommend this as one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last 15 years!
074356619X|1.0|Positive thinking... WE GET IT ALREADY!!! The same information is repeated over and over throughout the book. Basically, the theme is that if you think you already have something, you will get it. Save your money, skip this one.
B000002LUB|5.0|As weird as it could seem to be, this is my preferred Black Sabbath album. \\"WHAT!?\\" -- many of you might say; but the fact is, I like it more than any other Sabbath release, really. Ok, Ozzy albums are of course much more important than this one from a historical point of view. Also, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is a true masterpiece and a milestone in the career of the band. And well, after Dio, we got Tony Martin with his incredible pipes and several superbly produced albums, some of them excellent  -- \\"Tyr\\", \\"Headless Cross\\", \\"Eternal Idol\\"... But Dehumanizer to me is the one: less primitive than the releases with Ozzy (and let's face it: Dio is a better vocalist!); not at all Rainbow-like (like both \\"Heaven & Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\" were -- sorry about that); and deliciously rawer than Tony Martin releases. So, I guess I have some good reasons to have Dehumanizer at the top of my list, haven't I? :-) <br /> <br />So said, now I'll keep justifying my taste for this album by going song by song: the opener \\"Computer God\\" is very metal, with lots of primary-but-tasteful solos. It's one of the best on the album. \\"After All (The Dead)\\" reminds me Queen (or Savatage?) in a \\"darker\\" way, with some Ozzy-like vocal lines thrown in for a good measure. \\"TV Crimes\\" is that kind of NWOBM tune more in the Dio's vein than traditional Sabbath's, but it also brings back \\"Heaven & Hell\\" memories in a good way. \\"Letters from Earth\\" is this mid-paced, menacing song which doesn't forget about melody -- great song! \\"Master of Insanity\\" makes me think about early-Queensryche and Crimson Glory -- both the riffing and the harmony quote the two aforementioned bands in my mind. But those are good influences, aren't they? <br /> <br />But I go on, since there's no weak song here: in \\"Time Machine\\" Dio also plays Ozzy somehow, though it's rather a blend of both stylistic elements: Dio's and the good ole Sabbath's. \\"Sins Of The Father\\" is more of the same fusion-of-styles thing; and again Dio plays Ozzy,and this time it's even more apparent -- I love that angry Dio, really! \\"Too Late\\" is a slow song more on the Sabbath-with-Tony Martin's mood (or even the \\"Rainbowished\\" Sabbath), but of course with Dio using a different tonal palette. I love that song because it's soulful, Dio sounds uniquely aggressive and once again Iommi doesn't shy away from giving a good workout to his axe. In fact, Iommi does everything on this album: clean arpeggios, heavy riffs and very good solos, so guitar fans like me will be surely pleased -- ok, pretty simple stuff, just pentatonics and blues-based licks; but very effective soloing, since the pentatonic is the \\"wildcard\\" scale at the very end. ;-) <br /> <br />Later on we get \\"I\\" (not \\"Me\\", but \\"One\\"), again more on the NWOBM style. A killer, pure metal song! Then \\"Buried Alive\\" is another good old Sabbath tune; Dio goes back to Ozzy and himself, and once again I hear Queen here -- though it's a shame that the melody on the bridge just before the solos sounds pretty close to \\"After All (The Dead)\\". In any case, this Dio doing Mercury-like melodies is just amazing! <br />  <br />Shamefully, Dehumanizer gets frequently overlooked because it was released in 1992, so the timing couldn't be worst. Its production was a bit dated for the time and in addition grunge was already rocking the world -- sadly, I should add. Also, this angry, enraged set of songs was maybe too much for \\"Heaven & Hell\\" fans... Actually, I guess Sabbath fans took time to swallow and digest this pill. Firstly, those used to Tony Martin's Sabbath were into a more polished production and plenty of keyboards -- that is, a sort of Sabbath that wasn't bad, but wasn't the same Sabbath anymore. Secondly, Ozzy fans were already partially alienated since Ozzy left. And thirdly, Dio fans normally consume more melodic things than this, and this was not \\"Heaven & Hell\\" part II. So, Dehumanizer bombed. :-( <br />  <br />Luckily enough, I never was a very loyal fan of Sabbath. That's perhaps why this album does so well for me: extract of metal with class, simplicity, quality and conviction; and I don't care about anything else. So I think it deserves no less than 5 stars, really -- just open your ears and prepare to have a metal blast. Highly recommended!
B000001EKX|5.0|hotter than hell is hotter than hell and is the<br /><br />heaviest album of the first three. every song is<br /><br />a killer and has many they never played live. Ace<br /><br />Frehley's Strange Ways with Peter Criss singing is<br /><br />just a killer and worth it for that. Songs like<br /><br />Comin' Home, Mainline and All the Way are great!<br /><br />If you don't have any of the first three I would<br /><br />recommend this one first. hotter than hell!
B00005JPAM|5.0|This is a great peice of movie making.  For one thing, the tensions and dramatic moments in this film all occur  between two people talking quietly to one another in relatively small rooms.  Getting that right not only requires superb actors but also camera work that is, like a good butler, both intimate and discreet.<br /><br />Obviously this is Helen Mirren's movie and she shines in a way that encapsulates much of what made many of us rabid fans of her performances as Jane Tennison on the Prime Suspect television series.  Michael Sheen has some good moments as Tony Blair, and his (fictional) defense of the Queen is both moving and ironic given the way the real Tony has all but tripped over himself being George W. Bush's footstool.<br /><br />Director Steven Frears and his DP Affonso Beata, deserve huge credit for the emotional intensity and maturity of this film.  The leads are given plenty of room to do their stuff and they do, but the depth of this movie also relies on the stellar supporting cast.<br /><br />For my money, some of the best performances in the whole movie come from Roger Allam as Her Majesty (HM)'s private secretary Robin Javrin - the real Javrin apparently was a bit miffed at Allam's girth -it being somewhat more substantial than his own), Alex Jennings who plays  a surprisingly sympathetic Prince Charles, and of course Helen McCrory who makes the most of  a rather melodramatically rendered Cherrie Blair (shown as a rather shrill anti-monarchist, which unsurprisingly, did not go over well at Number 10).<br /><br />To understand the true perceptiveness of this movie in a British context, one has to understand the role of the monarchy in contemporary British society. Despite her aloofness from the public eye, the real Queen (and even more so, the late Queen Mother) were and are figures of great familiarity to the British public.  HM's very deliberate fashion sense and demeanor, while indicative of her own personality, were also essential in completing the transformation of the British monarchy from a 19th century aristocratic family a generation removed from politically-engaged monarchy, to an institution that wields no formal power but which is nonetheless, one of  the emotional lynch pins of modern, middle-class British sensibility.<br /><br />In contrast to Diana who became a celebrity in full People magazine mode, the Queen presents herself as a symbol of ordinary British middle-class sobriety and restraint.  Whilst much has rightly been made of the mantra \\"duty first, self second\\", a second and perhaps more important issue in understanding the tension between Diana and \\"The Firm\\" is the way in which Diana's \\"antics\\" were seen as a direct challenge to the public image of the older royals as a well-pedigreed but essentially decent and normal version of the good neighbors down the street.  This transformation lies at the heart of the British monarchy's ability to survive two world wars,  the end of the empire, the plummetting cultural prestige of the rest of the aristos, the rise and fall of the welfare state and finally: the triumph of cultural Thatcherism with its petit bourgeois envy and suspicion of anything collective.<br /><br />On an emotional level, middle-aged Brits tend to view HM as a woman who you could (with the right dress on) feel comfortable borrowing a cup of sugar from.  This leaving aside the actual wealth of the monarchy as an institution, a fact which continues to astound Americans who have a much more prosaic notion of figures of public interest - although I think one partial analogy who has achieved a similar level of emotional familiarity and trust for folks in the United States is Oprah Winfrey.<br /><br />In the same way that Oprah transcends her racial identity for her white audiences, the Queen (but interestingly, not her husband, nor to some extent her son Charles) has transcended her class position as the uber-aristocrat in a Britain where class is still vitally important (if somewhat muted by comparison with the 1930s).  At the risk of generalizing, I would say that a majority of Brits still feel a sense of personal loyalty to  the Queen herself (and hence the monarchy), while not necessarily supporting the class system, nor the political goals of the establishment.<br /><br />To the Queen, Diana then represented the culmination of a \\"loss of face\\" brought on by the younger royals (and Princess Anne's) public disgraces (primarily divorces) captured on the front pages of the loathsome tabloid press.  Whether or not she was the people's princess, she was certainly seen as garish, attention-seeking and vulgar by the Royal establishment.  Paradoxically perhaps, the very same solid citizens who relished the normality of the Queen, also devoured the fairy-tale glamor provided by Diana.  Royalty both serves and entertains, and in the age of reality TV, Diana was for better or worse, the icon for celebrity-royalty.<br /><br />HM's inability to engage with the changing face of Britain (generationally, racially and in terms of it's attachments to the outward symbols of class identity),  probably did blind her to the extent to which Diana of all the younger royals actually achieved the level of perceived personal intimacy that the Queen herself enjoyed.  I would hazard a guess that much of the public grief that was displayed at Diana's death was not over the death of Diana herself, but was an expression of mourning for personal tragedies.  Diana was a symbol for people's aspirations, and she was a person who continued to feed a sense of communal identity albeit through the glamor of celebrity despite her divorce.  In that sense, she was indeed \\"the people's princess\\".<br /><br />Director Frears deserves huge credit for capturing this tension without ever needing to bring the two women into contact with one another.  Mirren's Elizabeth reacts to televised images of Diana but we see the baffled annoyance she must have provoked in real life.  This is not a documentary, it is a work of fiction that seeks to highlight particular ideas and characters.  We will probably never know what HM thinks of the movie, but thanks to Frears and writer Peter Morgan have given us an intelligent, engaging and thought-provoking window into the human condition and into the possible mindset of a person who could be the longest-reigning constitutional monarch in a democracy since Queen Victoria.the risk of generalizing, I would say that a majority of Brits still feel a sense of personal loyalty to  the Queen herself (and hence the monarchy), while not necessarily supporting the class system, nor the political goals of the establishment.

B0002ADY24|4.0|Firefly is a good album but I'm not blown away.<br /><br />I love Uriah Heep and think the albums Innocent<br /><br />Victim and Fallen Angel were all brillant. Firefly<br /><br />just seems too laid back but has some great songs.<br /><br />Who Needs Me, Wise Man, Do You Know are all classic<br /><br />Heep songs and the bonus track Crime of Passion is a<br /><br />killer and should've been included on the album. After<br /><br />listening to Firefly I go back to High n' Mighty and<br /><br />Innocent Victim albums which are much stronger than this.<br /><br />But if your a Heep fan like me you won't be disappointed<br /><br />is you get it and it's worth a listen. OH the live version<br /><br />of Who Needs Me is a killer!

This movie sets a new tone and raises the bar for all future plot-twisting crime films!

0753820250|5.0|Daniel, the main character in The Shadow of the Wind, is a youth in 1940's era Spain.  He reads a book by Julian Carax, is entranced by the story and language, and searches over the next decade for Carax's other works.  He discovers that a mysterious man is one step ahead of him, buying books only to burn them, seeking to destroy all traces of the writer's existence.  As Daniel unearths the truth of Carax's life, he finds it unnervingly similar to his own, as if he is a character come to life from Carax's book, and may not be in control of his own life and fate.  This story is both mysterious and seductive, like relaxing in a cozy wingchair, and then discovering it is a on roller coaster. The story develops with that off-balance, unanticipated action, recounting events and desires that are both poetic and romantic, threatening and darkly haunting.  The translation from the Spanish has a lyrical quality that caresses the intense yearning for love and understanding, as well as enflames the vicious urge for revenge and destruction. There are poignant joys and mysterious coincidences, built to hopeful expectation, then slyly unraveled by unresolved misunderstandings, truths withheld and lies unconfessed.  Good characters, terrific language and atmosphere, about how blurred the lines are between reality and literature, life and art.
B000MV9026|4.0|While I have to disagree with the many negative reviews this movie has received, I can't agree that the movie is a really awesome classic either.  It's somewhere betweeen \\"above average\\" and \\"really good\\".  I guess that would make it \\"good\\". lol <br /> <br />Before watching Happy Feet, I knew there'd be a fair amount of musical bits with penguins singing and dancing all over the frozen landscape, but what I didn't know was that the storyline would be about penguins that HAVE to have a singing voice in order to fit in and be well-liked by the other penguins.  It's kind of pathetic to me that the penguins who couldn't sing had to be treated like yesterdays garbage by the other penguins.  Then again, it's just an animated film.  No reason to care about this *too* hard. <br /> <br />Anyway, even though musical bits in movies aren't really my thing, this one at least had a solid selection of tunes to elevate my interest.  Mostly older songs were included, such as funky Stevie Wonder-like music from the 70's or Queen's \\"Somebody to Love\\".  The one penguin singing Elvis's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" was REALLY funny.  You will love this scene. <br /> <br />They did a nice job in the beginning of the film giving the viewer a realistic idea of how penguins are born.  This was included and given a fair amount of attention, which was appreciated by me.   <br /> <br />Still, it was strange to me that the main character (the one penguin with the talent to tap dance) went through an extremely lengthy amount of time without the other penguins noticing that he had a real talent.  Just because he couldn't sing, he was ignored.  Then suddenly, after roughly 60% of the film went by, they began to notice his tap-dancing ability and began singing along to it and treating it like it was the most important thing in the world.  The penguins weren't made to look like intelligent creatures, that's for sure. <br /> <br />The action scenes were really good.  The penguins being attacked by birds and sharks was very exciting to watch.  It was fun watching them constantly find ways to escape.   <br /> <br />If you have an interest in penguins and think they're adorable little birds, you will no doubt LOVE this movie.  For me, it was just a pleasant and harmless story.
0780629450|2.0|Although not a fan of Kenneth Brannaugh's,  I was willing to give his Hamlet a fair viewing.  Since this is my favorite play, I was hoping the film would be better than his last two mediocre endeavors into Shakespeare's plays; unfortunately, it's worse! Beginning with the performances: Jack Lemmon is a wonderful actor, but here, he is an embarrassment, as are many of the other actors assembled, including Julie Christie (whom I usually adore). The casting is all over the map which makes for uneven performances and unsatisfying scenes. Brannaugh's own delivery of the text is rushed and usually unconvincing, despite the vehemence with which he delivers every over-ennunciated syllable, which sounds manic, bordering on farce. Bad direction and over-indulgent acting! It might be interesting to see what Brannaugh would do with good direction, instead of his own.  I could go on about my problems with the staging and other production values but the damage to this brilliant work is on every level and not worth going in to in depth.  <br /> <br />The good news is that Zefferelli's Hamlet, with another actor I don't normally like--Mel Gibson--is spot on perfect. The actor's are excellently cast, the production values and direction are serve the text, rather than competing with it, as in Brannaugh's version. Zefferelli knows his Shakespeare and his films, in my opinion represent the definitive versions (watch his Romeo & Juliet and Taming of the Shrew), too bad for us he didn't do more. Too bad, also, no one contemporary seems as capable. Instead we get the recent unwatchable junk with \\"hip-cool\\" sensibilities. Argh!   <br /> <br />It's not surprising no one is in a rush to produce a dvd of this tragedy of a film.

Not only is the book repetitive and difficult to read -- it's also full of stuff that's been written by everyone from Napoleon Hill to Tony Robbins.

B00008BLB8|5.0|If you are a GFR fan,this re-master is a must have! Don't mess about,just buy it. It sounds great in my truck CD system, but man, it's too cool to listen to the whole CD when I have the time to kill around the house,late at night.I have the old version AND this re-master version,and I must say,the difference is unreal.    These guys were THE band that Zep would not follow onstage. These fellows played for 2,500 people at the Filmore East,then 32,000 at Madison Square Garden,then 50,000+ at Shea Stadium,selling out faster than the Beatles.  The LIVE album and this one give you insight as to why.      Excellent buy...

B0007CNXUU|4.0|After watching Johnny Depp in such films as Pirates of the Caribbean and Secret Window, I couldn't even RECOGNIZE him in Finding Neverland.  Again, what a performance!  He's such a good actor.  Nuff said. <br /> <br />As for the storyline, it's about Depp's character being able to help take children and adults on journeys by simply using their imagination, if they believe in things hard enough.  The story is also about being creative using your mind to help you become a writer and write plays.  Depp found some children in a nearby park (actually, they found him) and throughout the film, Depp wanted the children to use their imagination to help them appreciate another side of life- dreaming and telling stories. <br /> <br />That's what I got out of the story.  It's pretty good overall, and the acting is phenomenal throughout the film, it's just that some of the people (such as the grandmother) came off like they were queens or something.  They weren't that important.  At least, I don't THINK so.  It's hard to tell with a movie like this. <br /> <br />It's worth watching this film.  There's something here for children and adults alike.

1582701709|1.0|This is a dangerous and insulting proposal. As a grieving overweight divorced mom who lives paycheck-to-paycheck, I PERSONALLY take offense to Byrne's literal interpretation of the Laws of Attraction. I worried --as most good mothers do--that something horrible would happen to my child. And she worried --as most children do--that she would die. Yes, my daughter died. No, it was not because I attracted it or she attracted it. And hundreds of friends and loved ones have stood by me in my time of grief and I doubt if ANY of them are worried about attracting death into their lives simply because they are supporting me. By the way, I have a lot of skinny, happily married, and rich friends, also. I don't think they attracted my weight or financial or marital issues just as I didn't attract any of their positive (or negative) issues. Yes, positive thinking is healthy. But no, our thoughts don't DIRECTLY manifest bad (or good) things to happen. If you want to read a much better and much more believeable book on this subject, read Deepak Chopra's \\"Synchrodestiny\\" or \\"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence.\\"
1577314808|5.0|I bought this book in 2001. I am still 'not fully there yet' but doing very nicely. So nicely that I am fully content with my present progress. For me Eckhart is walking the path of living in the present. He knows when to engage the thinking process and when to slip back in to full stillness. This is very achievable. There is a price though. You have to practice. How often? Well one can't very well be fully present if you show no determination to stay present. It's not some switch. It's very hard-earned. The question you have to ask is how badly do I want it? If you truely believe in your gut this is the only way to live your life then you'll put in the effort. Even if you slip into a dream for 6 weeks, you'll come back and try again. It's every minute. You slip away in a dream, you realise this you come back. How do you stay present? Always return to your centre. Your Hara. Dan Tien. A Universal living force of energy near your navel. Begin by relaxing the tummy muscles. Relax the lower back, relax the shoulders. Try counting your breaths. I find a count of 4 works well to start with.<br /><br />Also read up about Zen. Get the right books though. Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind is a classic. A read that's very clear. His follow on is just as good \\"Not always so\\". Zazen is not meditation it's stillness and observing what is with non-judgement.<br /><br />Eventually you'll break through. You'll get glimmers of that total stillness while being present and observing. That's all you need. Once tasted you know what to look out for.<br /><br />Zen is also really good at everyday life. Bringing in that awareness into everything. We do lots of really simple things automatically. One can then just sit back, prepare a relaxed centre and try stay with the task. Washing dishes is a good one. Taking one's time. Relaxed without a sense to jump onto the next thing and get the job done. You can just stand and just observe yourself do the dishes. Feel the relaxation.<br /><br />The other big thing I like in Zen is to not seek out the extra-ordinary like extra powers of second sight, or the great moment where everything makes sense. There is really no sense of searching, more a doing or a non-doing.<br /><br />Practicing complete stillness has to be done daily. If you don't even practice 10 minutes then you'll struggle to break through. Complete seated stillness and focus is the only way you'll develop enough power to breakthrough into your everyday life. It builds your reserves. It reduces over-active thinking.<br /><br />By focusing beyond thinking we can then tap into who we really are. Insights come to us. Or rather we can finally hear the inner voice of guidance because our ego's take on life is not shouting in our brains.<br /><br />This book is a great way to develop a sense of what this living in the present is about and how it can transform you. However, one book cannot give you all the answers. You'll need to keep researching the subject. There is no such thing as over-saturation. Zen Monks live in temples working day and night on being in the present. Whether in meditation, Zazen, doing the required daily living tasks, koans, it's all the time. Some stay well over 10 years or more. So if these monks are still 'not quite there' yet, you realise you just have to put in the time.<br /><br />For me now my whole life is centred around being present. Whenever, I stray from this, (often unconsciously) I stop enjoying life as much and the stress creeps back in.<br /><br />Just a last note about the Zen Monks. They will be the first to tell you that your life is perfect exactly as it is. You can practice right after reading this sentence and begin from there.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|A boy of humble origins. A girl of aristocratic lineage. They bond as young ones, they are separated. He becomes a gifted illusionist. She becomes the beautiful, strong-minded woman a crown prince needs to complete his particular ambitions for power. The illusionist performs, and suddenly, the city is under his spell. Is it real, what he does? Or it is just tricks? And will the Chief Inspector of Police be able to contain the growing danger, the political and social and personal repercussions, of the illusionist's actions, which increasingly incite treasonous (if true) accusations from his captivated audiences?<br /><br />The game is on, and it's on at many levels, personal and social and in the very palaces of power.<br /><br />The ending is, well, look at the title of the movie, watch the film,  and take a wild guess at how it ends. You may be right, as I was. No surprise.<br /><br />And yet, some pleasure. Quite a bit of pleasure. Even my hard to enthrall hubby sat through the whole thing and didn't once say, \\"Gee, how long is this thing anyway?\\" as he usually does when I put on a DVD. :)<br /><br />I like Edward Norton. I find his odd looks interesting, and I enjoy his acting talent. I find him versatile and with an air of depth about him that adds quite a bit to his dramatic endeavors, even when they are small, like his part in FRIDA. The man stands out for me.<br /><br />Jessica Biel surprised me. I'd only seen in her in one other, hardly satisfying film, the third in the BLADE series, so to see her convincingly elegant and intense (if not particularly brilliant) was a special and unexpected treat.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell has done royalty before (Charles II), and he has done bad boys before. He's got a sort of ferocity behind those eyes (one somewhat wall-eyed, which adds to the air of oddity) and he can act, for sure. He has a masculine power that makes him believable as a sadistic exploiter of women.<br /><br />But Paul Giamatti. Wow. I wouldn't have imagined this almost non-descript, unsexy guy could steal a movie, but steal it he does, right out from Norton's and Sewell's much more attractive noses. He's a complex character, walking that line between corruption and integrity, and that's always fascinating to watch, much more interesting than a mere good guy or a mere bad guy. Delightful. And the series of expressions on his face at the end, when he figures out what happens (for himself, for the audience) is a marvel to behold.<br /><br />The cinematography, the use of dark/light, the occasional startling use of red, the music, all these make for a terrific visual ride. One can forgive the giving of too many clues that ruin the surprise just for the fact that it's delicious to sit and watch these images unfold.<br /><br />And Norton manages to move beautifully as the illusionist--the hands, especially. He convinces me that he is what he is.<br /><br />The tricks are always fun to watch. I\\"m not so jaded that I can't have fun with it. Or the director and actors just make it fun. Whatever.<br /><br />Great tension (sexual and otherwise) between actors, and a bit of romance (love that first kiss, ahhh), and a glimpse at the power of people who will not be cowed by the powerful and corrupt.<br /><br />I recommend it for the above reasons.t have imagined this almost non-descript, unsexy guy could steal a movie, but steal it he does, right out from Norton's and Sewell's much more attractive noses.

I enjoyed every minute of this video.  But if you are only looking at that one thing you are missing the big picture of this video. I worried about everything. I still do, but now I fight to overcome this anxiety I have lived with. Who cares about how much make she is wearing! This is about making you feel better and getting what you want. I have put this to use in the last week and I am overwhelmed and surprised by the outcome of my actions, and what I have been able to accomplish.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|While much of \\"Babel\\" made me squirm uncomfortably, it had a powerful cumulative impact.  Nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and winning Best Picture awards from the American Film Institute and the Golden Globes, it is a film with credentials.  The last shot as the camera draws away from the top floor Tokyo skyscraper was breathtaking to me.  Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Best Director award @ Cannes and was nominated for the Oscar.  His film \\"Amores Perros,\\" loosely translated as \\"Love's A B*tch,\\" previously won the best foreign language award in Britain.  In that picture he worked with Adriana Barraza who rose to prominence in \\"Babel\\" with her Best Supporting Actress nomination as Amelia, the Mexican housekeeper who takes the children she cares for to her son's wedding in Mexico.  Brad Pitt has only been nominated for one Oscar (Best Supporting Actor for \\"12 Monkeys\\" in 1995), but he turns in a finely tuned performance as Richard, a father who grieves the death of a child and finds himself frantically trying to find medical care for his wife.  The emotional territory he traverses in the film is impressive, particularly the phone conversation he has with his son as he tries to pretend that everything's okay while worried that his wife will die on the surgical table.  His body slumps toward the phone like a man on the edge just trying to hang on.  It's one of his best performances.  Playing his wife Susan is Australian actress Cate Blanchett who won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2004 for \\"The Aviator\\" and was nominated again this year for \\"Notes on A Scandal.\\"  She does a good job as the wounded wife in a foreign land who through this crisis overcomes her grief for her lost child and rediscovers her love for her husband.  Movies about husbands and wives who fall in love with each other always play well with me; and this aspect of this film was most charming, despite the gore.  Rinko Kikuchi who played in the Japanese film \\"Ikitai,\\" translated as \\"Will to Live,\\" is stunning as the deaf mute adolescent whose grief for her mother's suicide leads her to act out improperly.  I'm not sure of the name of the Japanese policeman who comes to her apartment to interview her, but it is an excellent, tender scene.  As Chieko, Kikuchi was also nominated for the Oscar from this film.  Gael Garcia Bernal as Santiago gives a good performance as he goes crazy while questioned by a border patrol.  Michael Pena who played the locksmith in \\"Crash\\" gives a cameo performance as John Border Patrol who apprehends Amelia.  The international scope of the picture is breathtaking as we travel from a Middle Eastern country to Southern California & Mexico to Japan.  While my squirm factor was raised high with some of the blood & gore as well as the adolescent nudity, I came away appreciating this film as one that calls for greater understanding among people.  That universal theme plays well in these troubled times.  Enjoy!to Live,\\" is stunning as the deaf mute adolescent whose grief for her mother's suicide leads her to act out improperly.

B00005JPAM|4.0|Helen Mirren is a revolation in this movie, she channels the Queen, it's uncanny how well she nails her.  As for the movie..I enjoyed it, it had a nice pace and the performances, particularly Cromwell as the neanderthal Phillip and the actor who played Tony Blair, but it is Mirren who elevates this movie, she is reviting.  I appreciated the way the director used real stock footage along with newly shot stage pieces; very well done.  If there is one off note performance it was the simpering, pathetic Charles, I just dont see him as being such a dolt.  The real Charles has bucked his mother in the past, and is passionate to a fault on subjects close to his heart, like the environment and modern architecture, the way he is portrayed here, is a cowering wimp, whining and hand wringing, I just did not see that during the time of Diana's death, I thought Charles showed dignity and respectful deferance to his mother, afterall, she is the Queen, not some simpering fool, who is afraid of his mother.  Anyway, all and all, good film..great lead performance: very well earned Acadamy Award, if for the stag sceen alone.

B000IFQLSW|4.0|So, most people will tell you that the DVD was great. I, on the other hand, believe that the dvd was not all it was hyped up to be. I was hoping that the DVD would be less documentary and more live music. Sure, there's live music here but it's cut with KWS and others giving insight to the blues music they're playing. That's all well and good but I want to hear the whole song. I want to see the whole song preformed, not just cuts of it. The CD is great and I was hoping that the DVD would be just like the CD except..of course...with video. I was wrong. I don't think anyone has done a good job of explaining that the performances are mixed with interviews. Know that before you go hoping this will be a Live KWS DVD.
B000006MS3|5.0|This album blew me away when I first purchased it back in the mid eighties. Being a Kate fan, I've watched her career mature, excel and take a long vacation which recently culminated in yet another masterpiece, 'Aerial'. Still, as excellent as her follow up, 'The Hounds of Love' and the later 'Sensual World' were, it is this album, 'The Dreaming' where Kate's unbridled creativity is on display in its awesome splendor. The amazing thing about Kate Bush is that she is totally original. Each track on here is in a world of its own. So many divergent musical styles and vibes... Creative musical ideas and never been heard before sounds, rythmns and stylings. The woman is a formidable artist, and I think this collection shows it as well or better than anything she has done. So the album was a commercial failure???? Kate, take that as a complement. Its SO GOOD its beyond the ability of the average 'joe' or 'jane' to appreciate I suppose. Appreciate it, I do. It never fails to leave me suspended in gaffa.
078322933X|3.0|Movies about a guy who terrorizes a whole family are not so uncommon in the American film production. Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR is a good example of a film dealing with this thematic if, of course, one doesn't count the hundreds of B-movies available here at Amazon. Now, why James Foley, the acclaimed director of AT CLOSE RANGE, took an interest in such a project ?<br /><br />A careful vision of FEAR, beyond the thrills produced by this kind of film, is necessary. In this perspective, the first scene of the movie is very revealing. A father of a 16 years old girl is shocked by the sexy clothes she's wearing. With his very protective behaviour, he will then do everything he can to get away David Mc Call from Reese Witherspoon. With little success of course. Note the numerous references to make-up, clothes, condoms in FEAR as if the characters wanted to protect themseves. From what ? From the bestial Mc Call whose apparitions in the film always coincide with the destruction of the protections carefully created by the father Steve Walker. Reese Witherspoon gets an hematoma while tring to protect her friend Gary from David's burst of anger and she will have her first sexual experience with him. Note also how Mc Call likes to mutilate himself, always eager to make his blood flow to prove his love for the young girl. In fact, FEAR is not a movie about a guy terrorizing a family, it's a movie about a girl becoming a woman, about a father who's afraid of it and about their fears epitomized by an unsettling Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />A DVD zone future stars.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|I went into this movie with high expectations. The cast and director had done some outstanding work in the past. The plot sounded interesting, with ample chance for rich story and character elements. I came out more disappointed than in any movie in years. A borrowed \\"bank heist\\" premise and a few gritty, stylized, or eccentric touches and small-scale human-nature observations do not add up to a good movie. This is true no matter how talented, intelligent, and otherwise successful the people involved. I cannot join in a chorus of empty praise for what is so clearly a failed film.    The storytelling was slow-paced, uneven, disorganized, and uninspired. Long before the film finally dragged to an end and revealed the secret of the heist, I had stopped caring. When the drawn-out movie was not belaboring dense details that did not add up to anything larger, it was veering into thin, superficial subplots -- ones that were either boring or far-fetched and sensationalistic -- with even more superficial characters, dialogue, and interactions.    None of the characters were worth caring about or had any depth. They were mere stick-figure plot devices. I have never seen Denzel Washington look bad until this film, or play a less coherent, less impressive character. Other characters were cardboard villains, perhaps with some shock-value traits pasted on for effect, even down to the gray-haired establishment type who appeared briefly to spew obscenities every other word. Jodie Foster made an interesting ice-cold, high-society \\"fixer,\\" and Clive Owen a smooth, cool, wily robber, but their thin, flat characters were mere injected devices for unbelievable actions and story lines.  Despite their talents, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were able to add nothing, with stiff performances in empty roles.  An air of pseudo-sophistication threw a wet blanket on all of the performances.    As a commentary on society or human nature, the film's observations seem trivial. As a crime drama, the police work could not have been less impressive or the dramatic presentation less suspenseful. The rushed attempt toward the end to tie together plot threads, finally create some dramatic momentum, and belatedly manufacture heroics was confusing, contrived, unrealistic, out-of-place, and ineffective.    Quite frankly, the disparate elements of this uneven film did not come together to tell a meaningful or entertaining story on any level. It was a major disappointment.  The movie does not deserve all the strained, lame attempts to portray it as a masterpiece or to make excuses for it.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor Swift has a great voice and I love all of her songs.  Don't let her age fool you.  \\"Tim McGraw\\" is a great song, but I also like \\"Our Song\\" and \\"Should've Said No\\" as well.  She has both slow songs that make you think and fast songs that you want to sing and dance to.  I can't wait to see her in concert this summer.  If you love Carrie Underwood, you will love Taylor Swift.  Another rising star in country music and she has only released two songs so far.
1932907009|5.0|Billed as the last book on screenwriting you will ever need, Snyder's book isn't about the mechanics of formatting etc, but it IS about how to plan an idea and corral the design into a workable structure. A fun, intelligent read, filled with loads of sensible advice and examples.
0743487583|5.0|In Mary Shelley's novel, there are various statements about the use of science. The field of eugenics is brought into question. The issue of cloning is brought into perspective way before its time. Shelley's novel is prophetic in so many ways for revealing the debates and scientific issues of contemporary times. From the recent FDA consideration of livestock cloning  to genetically engineered crops, these controversial issues have been compared to Frankenstein science. Other past scientific innovations such as the use of pesticides like DDT have led to failure and proved dangerous for human civilization. These too were once compared to Frankenstein science, yet humankind persisted on using these chemicals, all for reasons of convenience and capital ambition on the part of corporations involved. We may see Shelley's Frankenstein as the first great scientific warning to humans in an industrial world. It may also be seen as the beginning of environmental awareness. This awareness concerns humans within their own environments such as parent/child relationships and childhood influences,  as well as human impact on nature.
B000056VPD|5.0|\\"I'm never gonna drive my Ferrari again - not after that bug hit the windshield\\".  <br />OK, there is  a brief - maybe 30 seconds long - incident with a probably inebriated woman, but it's not that big a deal, folks! Benson handled the situation with class and dignity as one would expect. The music went on without interruption. And yes, these things do happen at live concerts. Some folks need to lighten up a little. <br />Benson is an amazing performer and this DVD shows off his incredible talent and versatility. The set list includes his biggest hit songs, and the audience is enjoying every delicious morsel of it. Who can blame them for wanting to dance? I couldn't sit still while watching it in my living room. <br />If you like George Benson, you will probably enjoy this concert. On the other hand, if you're the type that would toss out the Ferrari because a bug hit the windshield, this concert may not be for you.
0767836324|1.0|Seldom has so much talent (and MONEY!) been wasted on such unentertaining silliness. <br /> <br />Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins--it is painful to watch them cope with the bad writing, overemoting, over-elaborate (and dull) sets, and just general aimlessness of this picture. <br /> <br />Everybody works REALLY hard, and the strain shows. <br /> <br />The fun seems forced, the situations pointless, the message ham-handed, and the music--oh, my goodness--the music is the most syruppy mess this side of \\"Pearl Harbor.\\" <br /> <br />Even the special effects are less than special. <br /> <br />All in all, very uncomfortable to sit through.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|With a nod to all those with an esoteric review that proclaimed this awesome, I am not so inclined to gush.  Instead of shock and awe, I was shocked and sickened.  Do we need boys masturbating, women peeing, callous treatment of middle aged women, and troubled girls pulling men's hands into their crotches to tell a story?  It's not even a very good story:  \\"How a rifle affected lives in 4 countries\\".  The quality of acting was superb, but give me Troy every day of the week and twice on Sunday.  I'd return the movie if I could.

0425129608|3.0|Having already read the excellent MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, and being slapped in the face with one of the biggest twists I've ever read in any novel, I was really looking forward to another good mystery from this legendary author, and featuring the underrated and entertaining Inspector Hercule Poirot.  Sadly, however, I was actually disappointed with this one, and as a result, I was disappointed - disappointed that I was actually disappointed with an Agatha Christie novel.  How did--how *could*--THAT happen?? <br /> <br />The mystery took so long to really start dropping clues, and by the time I was nearly done with it, things started to actually getting mysterIOUS.  A major (though false) lead appeared halfway through, and while there was speculation as to how it tied in to everything, there was no real resolution to it.  And when the revelation happened, it was done in a sort of offbeat way, and the last chapter was just a giant, lengthy explanation from Poirot as to what actually happened and why, which was interesting...until the last page and a half were taken up by a conversation between two characters that really could have been a lot shorter. <br /> <br />Why am I even breaking down the book into the reasons I didn't like it??  How could I have this much negative stuff to say about an Agatha Christie novel?  She's AGATHA CHRISTIE! <br /> <br />Hopefully this was, much like Poirot's vacation in the novel, a sort of temporary lull in the bigger adventures.  I'll still read other novels, but sadly, my second Christie read left much to be desired.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Boy, talk about a disappointing release from a mega-star... Although I really like Gwen Stefani, this was not one of her prouder moments. This album is \\"different\\" to say the least, but that's about as close to a compliment I can get. A few of the tracks are decent, and holds a nice background beat, but most of the album will leave you wondering what happened to the heavy ska-instilled sounds of her previous albums. Instead, it almost appears as if Gwen decided to give club music a shot and release an album full of artificial beats, club flavor, and superficially-based lyrics. \\"Wind It Up\\" is the first track on this album, and if you can get past it, you may have a flavor for her new material... But, if you listen to \\"Wind It Up\\" and think, \\"what in the hell is that?\\", then you're probably where I'm at... confused and disappointed. It was definitely a disappointment for me, since I was looking forward very much to her release of this album after her previous albums were much more to my liking.
1416524800|4.0|Whether or not you enjoy this book depends on what you're seeking. If you're looking for non-stop action, tension ratcheted to the screaming point, unrelenting nail-biting suspense, come on in. But if you want character development, plot nuances, and dialogue subtleties, give this one a miss. This book is like an aging beauty queen: looks great so long as you don't look too close.<br /><br />Like the Da Vinci Code, Brown whomps on the gas pedal from the first page, grabbing the reader with a brutal and inexplicable murder from the get-go. Rarely would the action let up enough for me to put the book down even for a moment. Brown does a simply outstanding job of keeping the story moving and the reader hooked into wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />With the scenery speeding by, it's easy to overlook the preposterous premise supporting the plot. Killing off the book's characters because \\"they know\\" about the fraudulent meteorite, begs the question of why were all the others left alive who actively participated in fashioning the phony rock and inserting it in the ice cap. Such a deception would involve many \\"someones\\", including the NASA spokesman who lied on TV about \\"discovering\\" the meteorite. Further, painting the US Delta Force as bad guys was bad enough, but pitting the Delta Force against a female gist writer and her TV star boyfriend....well, guess who lost?! However, any couple who can endure near death sailing off an ice cliff, plunging into the raging sea, a bout of hypothermia, being attacked with machine guns, injuries galore, ship wreck, fire, and a sunken sub ride--all in one day--and still have enough energy to jump into the sack together--deserves to win.<br /><br />With all that it still gets four stars. I got what I was looking for.
B000002NZO|3.0|This album is the second but should be considered as the first release of the band. With this one, the band was free to explore and create, this was not what happened with their first release.  <br />From Genesis to Revelation) <br /> <br />All the tracks are good but not great.  Real close to Nursery Cryme in my opinion.  If you like old Genesis lie Nursery Cryme or Foxtrot, you should own this CD.
0446343129|5.0|It is amazing the damage sugar does to the body. this is a must have book for every household in America.
B000KRN07S|3.0|Four stars for the CD, two stars for the marketing.  I decided I wasn't going to make the same mistake I did on Feels Like Home, and just bought the CD this time around.  The DVD wasn't worth it the first time (I watched it once), and judging by the description the DVD isn't worth it the second time either.  Besides Norah looks just fine to me on a field of red.  You have to love these little marketing tricks.  I suppose this is Blue Note's way of keeping you from downloading the music.  If they really want to treat you, they would combine her CD with a DVD of live performances, then it might justify the $20 price tag.
B00005Q66T|4.0|First of all, I love this CD. It is a great collection for Madonna's 1990-2000's career.  <br />However, I was a bit disappointed since it adds nothing special. That is there are no new songs, or special mix.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for Madonna's hit songs in one CD, this is a great <br />album. However, if you are huge fan of Madonna and already having all the CDs of her, there is really nothing special about this CD.  <br /> <br />Moreover, many great songs are not included.
B000002U8G|3.0|Meddle is a transition album between what was Pink Floyd before and what it would become.  Previous albums were \\"psychedelic\\" and the following ones were classic prog.  \\"One of these days\\" is a classic and \\"Echoes\\" is simply magical.  The songs between these two are good but not great. Overall, a must have just for \\"Echoes\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is so authentic and so well done, I can't say enough good about it.  I liked it much better than the newer \\"modern\\" version, because everything about it was much more true to the time period (including the acting).  It was so entertaining and even my husband (who doesn't normally sit through 5 let alone 2 hours of this type of movie) thought it was great!!
B00000251N|5.0|I have owned this soundtrack since it was on LP, bought the 8-track. Had the cassette and now I have three CDs; one at home, one at work and one in the car. It lifts me up every time I hear it. It is music I consider Neil Diamond at his best. Very spiritual.
B000002UA2|1.0|If the name Pink Floyd wasn't on this cd, who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ?  I am a Pink Floyd fan, but I have to say that I don't like any of their early works.  To me, the band begins to make great stuff with \\"Meddle\\" and their first cd were boring, even with the Pink Floyd name on it. The only good track is \\"Childhood's end\\", the other tracks are poor.
B00007J36G|5.0|This music is undefinable ultimately. Oh yes, one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive. One can say many things about it. For me, this, along with \\"Up the Downstairs\\" are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day. I've become a collector of PT's stuff and like most of it very much indeed. Check out some of the side projects of the members in the band--like Blackfield and No-Man. They are worth good listenings too. But, you know, this wouldn't be a bad album to start your PT experience with. No, not at all!
0783225733|5.0|I first saw this film at the cinemas back in 1995 and have seen it countless times since then. I have always been a space enthusiast and remember reading books about astronauts and the Saturn V rocket as a kid. This film is probably the most technically accurate spaceflight film out there. I love how all the zero G scenes are real (filmed in KC-135 aircraft) and all of the switches,lights etc. in the Command module are 100% realistic. The Saturn V liftoff was incredible. This film is still as exciting to watch today as it was back when it came out.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This album is amazing from th beginning to the end, every songs is great. <br />Even if it was recorded in 1973, the sound is still very actual if you compare to other recording made in the same period. Dark side is really a classic album, a masterpiece and an unforgettable album, that have influenced many bands and musicians.  A must have for any serious music lover, a piece of history.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This and the 35th Anniversary Tsongas dvds are must haves for the Yes fans out there. I can't say which I like better. It is fun watching the orchestra really getting into it. The music is as close to perfection as it could be. Get this and the 35th anniversary dvd. You won't regret it if you are a Yes fan. Of course on this one, I missed Rick Wakeman, but the other keyboardist did a superb job of filling in.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have to agree with so many other reviewers - this one is up there with 1995 P&P. Casting, production and adaptation are superb. While the film does not follow the book exactly, I find the changes to fit in with the story.  BUT although I loved the final scene, I wish they would have followed the book there, as I adore the final scene in the book. I strongly recommend reading the book as well. Mr. Thornton has now joined Mr. Darcy as my all time fav fictional leading man that I encourage my husband to follow as an example in any way possible :)
1400032717|5.0|As the mother of a young boy who is on the spectrum, I found this book very uplifing, despite crying as it ended.  I would recomend this book to any Mathmatics major (I tutor Math- therefor am surounded by them, and I have been dying to buy a copy for everyone in the Math department at my school.), as well as anyone who involved in the special needs community (which I also grew up in and around).  <br />     The hero of this book is a young boy who has a Behavior Disorder and autisum.  He decides to do some detective work after finding a dead dog, he of course suceeds, despite his disabilities.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|WOW, it shocks me that so many people write glowing reviews of this film! I just rented it and thought it was BORING! I had trouble staying awake while watching it the film was so boring! The Film goes NOWHERE, it tries so hard to be like those far superior films TRAFFIC and CRASH but it doesnt even get off the ground. The stories dont seem to connect and the characters are so forgettable. It didnt surprise me that the film didnt win many oscars, shouldnt have even been nominated . Trust me, your time is to valuable to waste your time with this mess. Its a shame because Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are Excellent Actors but they were wasted in this film. I HATED IT!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I watched this movie on an airplane, without high hopes; airline films are often not the best, and having been subjected to nonstop junk on the outward leg, expected the same on the way back.  But I was happily surprised by \\"The Illusionist.\\"<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent.  The characters are well-drawn by the script, and the actors bring out more than one dimension - particularly Giamatti.  I didn't care for the movie \\"Sideways,\\" but the plus side of that movie is that it got Giamatti some roles that he really deserved and could play well.  The script generally avoids falling into cliche, and sets the movie in a period and location that we haven't seen much of before.  The cinematography is wonderful, having a color theme that doesn't go over the top, and that evokes an old film in parts (frames that go just a little too fast, or are just out of focus for a second).<br /><br />In places, the movie drags a little, but not so much as to knock it down a star.  \\"The Illusionist\\" is at least worth a rent.
B0002858YS|3.0|Musically, the group can be pretty dang good.  The first half of the album is quite enjoyable with notable musical talent appropriate use of synthesizers.  Unfortunately, the later part of the album gets into 80's oversynthesized junk that I didn't listen to back then, either.  You'll hear all manner of older works being channeled into their sound to create a far richer experience than somthing so clearly derivative would typically deliver -- this is a good thing; they can play. <br /> <br />And they can write, too, but this is where things get a bit dodgy.  I'm hard pressed to describe the album as more than a parade of assorted psychological disorders in males with repressed or inadequate outlets.  Seriously, some of this stuff is really pretty disturbed -- think \\"The Great Gatsby\\" wishing he were \\"Hamlet.\\"  Never mind the instruments, there is a delusional and twisted yet honest mind at work in the lyrics.  It's kind of a fusion of negative tones from New Order and The Cure. <br /> <br />That said, if you're intrigued and not wholly turned off by synthesizers, it's probably worth the noticibly discounted price (or picking up used as I did).
B000IAZPKM|5.0|If you are a Kamelot fan, this is simply a must have.  I am amazed at how well this is done.   I actually saw the Black Halo concert in NYC at BB Kings last year, and this video is even better than seeing them live in many ways.  The concert video is immaculate, sound is pretty decent (its never really that great on concert videos), and the extras are somewhat decent, if not somewhat limp and benign.    <br /> <br />But this is all about the Black Halo concert, plain and simple.   Just amazing and perfectly captured and filmed.  Its no wonder that Kamelot has risen to the top of the heap of progressive rock, metal and just about every other category one might place them in....
B000002MIY|5.0|Whereas Fagen's earlier release \\"The Nightfly\\" focused on a central theme based in the past, 1993's \\"Kamakiriad\\" takes you on a futuristic road trip.  The same can also be said of the music.  While The Nightfly still borrowed largely from the Steely Dan \\"Gaucho\\" sound, Kamakiriad is much more contemporary (and hinted at the sound Dan-Heads could expect years later when Becker & Fagen resurrected the band name in 2000).  This album is primarily smooth-jazz (a.k.a. \\"cocktail-jazz\\"), but it's a nice mix of up-tempo numbers and slower, smoother tunes.  \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" received some radio play, and if you remember it and liked it, this album is for you.  Owners of Steely Dan material from the new millenium will also appreciate this one.  I purchased this record in 1995 and it's still as fresh today as it was back then.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|I'll be honest, this movie is just not a kind of movie I care for, but I give it credit, many other people are right to like it. It is good drama. An interesting weave of timelines and segments of a tale. A family of goat herders gets a gun to shot jackels, and american couple is in marocco because the husband is trying to escape the death of his infant son, and meanwhile a nanny is in southern california taking care of the other two kids of the american couple. Ad a japaneese school girl and her father into the mix, and you think, how the heck can you tie these together?  Well, it the movie does, and dramatically. It did develop slowly, but nothing was unexpected, i could have summed up the movie at the beginning. Now the sidestory with the japaneese father/daughter, very loosly tied in, to me added filler, but dramatically done.  It is catching, and most should find this film moving. I guess I missed the point if any that the film was trying to make.   Check it out, interesting to see what the acadamy awards were talking about, but I never did care for the \\"critically acclaimed\\" movies anyway, usually there predictable and drug out, like this film really was, but no hollywood big wig will admit.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|To the Nay-sayers of this film. <br /> <br />First of all, yes, the dysfunctional family is over the hill in film-age.  However, I felt that there was some originality with the camera work if not so much the story-line.  As far as the characters, Alan Arkin did a TREMENDOUS job pulling in the audience to really love him for his great qualities, while ignoring the bad ones.  Not just any actor could do that, and thus Alan's win for best supporting actor. <br /> <br />Next, I would say that this movie suffers from the \\"Sideways-Syndrome\\".  A lot of people HATED Sideways simply because it was marketed as a pure hilarious comedy.  Sideways did have a lot of very funny lines and moments, but narrowminded viewers think that movies should only be in one category or the other.  Comedy mixed with an overall dramatic film was too much for some viewers to handle, and they missed out. <br />The dark comedy along with painful realizations of real life drama (losing a loved one, fighting social stereotypes and expectations) provides a beautiful build up for triumph; a triumph which is the FUNNIEST MOMENT ON FILM IN THE PAST 5-10 YEARS.  This is slow painful build up, gives the viewer such a release of happiness, which is the film's strongest point. <br /> <br />And finally, if you are going to be a 'Hater', give more reasoning than \\"This movie was a waste of time....\\"  because those kind of \\"reviews\\" are a waste of time in themselves.
1400082773|5.0|this is a good read and a great story. the book was on time and well I'm voteing for him now after reading this thanks
0374105235|5.0|My only regret on this book is that the author did not take us further into his life in America.  How he maintained he gentle heart after what he has been through is a marvel.  I know he will have nightmares and flashbacks for the rest of his life, but this young man has written an eye opener that we must all read. <br /> <br />Like others who have reviewed it,I read the book in two sittings.  <br /> <br />Wars remain within those who fight them long after they have returned home or moved on.  God Bless you Ishmael.

0671027344|5.0|A few years ago a friend of mine bought me this book. I quite enjoyed it at the time.  I forgot about it until last November when i was going through my old belongings, and found it.  I immediately picked up the novel, and zoomed through it in a day or two.  A month or so later, I read it again and still enjoyed it.<br /><br />I just think the novel provides an interesting look at relationships.  I believe we can all relate to at least some of it.<br /><br />Anyway, I've now bought this book for three friends, all of whom liked it.  I've told everyone and anyone about it whenever the subject of literature pops up.  It is simply an easy, quick read that makes you feel good.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Star Trek shall forever remain a visionary and highly intelligent series. It provides a treasure of knowledge and insight. Would highly recommend acquiring this series, especially if you have a family. We regularly watch the episodes offered and have become... real fans of  Star Trek. Would highly recommend acquiring the collection.
0375704027|5.0|All I can say is the last two mornings I've felt really upbeat when waking up.  I am not a morning person.  It is winter. I hate the cold.  My job is dull and boring. The only thing I can think of that would cause me to be in good spirits is this book. I've devoured it on my commute to the aforementioned bore of a job I have. It has made me smile and happy.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few suicides in the story. Nevertheless, there is plenty of love and happiness in the novel that are very uplifting.  There is also plenty of humor.  I highly recommend the book.<br /><br />Lastly, while I also enjoyed the Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, I have to admit that I liked this one more simply because it was more straight forward and easier to follow.  yes, I'm an intellect like that.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|I tried, I really did.  I tried so desperately to like this album.  I listened to it again and again, but it just didn't click.  Bat One is, in my opinion, one of the great albums of all time; I have listened to it since it came out in the 70s and have never grown tired of it.  Bat Two was a bit weaker, yet still quite good.  I looked very forward to this third installment, and my initial disappointment has not abated.  After several months of attempting to like this album, I am sure it will likely never again be heard on my stereo.  But, that being said, I will happily pull out Bat Two, and especially Bat One.
0800177177|3.0|Lord, where to begin?  <br /> <br />First, as one reviewer mentioned, the greatest versions of the story to date are indeed both \\"Nosferatu\\" (Murnau/Herzog). There is no great adaptation of the novel.  <br /> <br />That said, there are both really irritating, fascinating aspects as well as moving moments in this version. Here's an example. The Prologue. Great atmosphere, but Tony Hopkins priest garb looked like it came from an Ed Wood movie complete with cotton candy hair and clutching a little cross made out of two popsicle sticks. Contrast Oldman's flayed man armor and Elisabeta's sumptuous gown (tho I had to think of Scarlett's curtains several times in the movie--wt-?).  <br /> <br />Usage of the Romanian language was really great in all instances. Scenes with the brides were scary enough, minus the sex scene (stupid).  <br /> <br />The prologue set up an interesting theory, but how would Elisabeta be able to reincarnated as Mina if she never died, was the walking dead due to her suicide? A man's will causes him to live forever, obsessed with blood and stealing it from others?  I have to see the movie once more, but I do remember him cursing the priests as in \\"your god and you... this is my reward?\\" so essentially he defied the Church. So did Luther and the rest of us Protestants and as far as I know none of us turned into blood-sucking ghouls... ;) <br /> <br />I didn't like Lucy's sexual forwardness while alive/before she was first bitten. It was like Valley girl speak in an English accent, totally unbelievable. Scene in the crypt was very disturbing, tho. <br /> <br />I did not buy the love story ultimately. There were some touching moments that belonged in another movie, as in the scene when Prince Vlad and Mina meet first on a London street. The concept was romantic, but ultimately, neither one were great people. No one knows if Harker's dead or alive, but Mina was very easily seduced by the Prince.. so much for virtuous (Check Adjani in Herzog's version).Also, in this version, Mina is portrayed as a thinking sort of person (what with her typewriter), but meets a man named Vlad and has noooo idea it's a slavic name nor connects the \\"coincidence\\" with her fiance in transylvania. My Victorian damsel's suspicions would have been raised. <br /> <br />Harker, the poor bastard nevertheless  truly loved the witch, even letting her go at the very end. Keanu's accent may have been off, but I believed him, especially later in the movie. Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are great actors, Richard E. Grant et al really got into it, so that helped, be they sympthetic or not. <br /> <br />There were some startling cinematic visuals, the music haunting (didn't make you laugh, whew). Again, some intriguing ideas, an engaging two hours, but not the definite version.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|The former \\"Vice\\" President jumps from junk philosophy (his commentary on Rene' Descates in his first book was hilarious and thoroughly entertaining)to junk science in his convenient \\"documentary\\" which indeed should net enough money as an Academy Award winner to defray the $30-thousand per year electric bill for his mansion. But that's inconvenient to bring up here. True, as one reviewer on this site observed, Gore is truly \\"passionate,\\" however, pure passion alone without a fair treatment of the evidence is just that, passion, and hardly inductive reasoning (I hear Aristotle throwing up). I have taught philosophy and statistical analysis at university, and Gore makes more mistakes than what can be assessed here. Two immediate logical fallacies are (1) the vast fluctuations in the earth's climate occurred in prerecorded humankind history which hundreds of scientists on the \\"other\\" side of the issue have weighed in on, yet somehow are conveniently evaporated from this \\"documentary\\", and (2) even if the United States signed the Kioto treaty, yea, this would have absolutely no impact on the current situation of carbon emissions, acid rain, and other contaminants worldwide. If countries such as China, Indonesia and other key players don't sign up for the Program and, more importantly, actually follow through with a demonstrable policy of accountability that can be objectively measured by outside sources, then the whole notion that any combined effort will have any impact on Planet Green is utterly laughable. In addition, Gore is sententious -- a pompous and moralizing egomaniac who apparently needs something to occupy his time with, so why not pontificate on how we Americans are using and abusing the earth. I would hope that the thankfully \\"former\\" Vice president and \\"former\\" presidential candidate will take his new science fiction apokalypto to, say, China, or to Indonesia, or to India, or to Russia, or better yet, the formerly pro-American, pro-military gulag known as Hollywood. He is good at raising money for the Democrat coffers and should be able to enlist his superior intellectual buddies such as Thetan Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, what's-her-name, er, Barbra Streisand, to mention a few. I would give a grade of a mercy C-plus for this \\"documentary\\", and a combined IQ of a generous 40 for content, and a straight A for bells and whistles. But none of this really matters, you see, when we all feel so, well...passionate!  I look forward to \\"Inconvenient Truth Part II: The Search for More Money.\\"  Widescreen edition, Director's Cut, Two DVD's, Interviews with the whales, of course. Stephen Gruber    P.S. 5-11-07: I see my review accomplished what I hoped it would, viz., a heated discussion. Some Greens have posted, and that's a good thing. FYI: Gore held himself out in his first book as a philosopher, so I posted my philosophy doctorate which is now gone (I was hoping he would feel the \\"heat\\" to chime in -- no such luck, maybe when things...\\"cool\\" off :))

B000KCHZK6|1.0|I was expecting an album of ballads and love songs. I am not sure what catagory these fall into, maybe folk songs? Yuck, yuck and yuck. Played it 2x, will give it away to someone who might appreciate it. I didn't.
B000025SL5|5.0|While I was lukewarm with the Chariots of Fire theme, this particular album gave me a different feeling.  As a lifelong horse lover, I was especially impressed when the first tract, \\"Opening\\" was used as background music for a major event.  Last November, over 100 horses were stranded on an offshore sandbar in the Netherlands.  As the flood waters receded, the video of their daring rescue showed footage of Dutch riders taking their mounts through the water to guide the surviving horses to shore.  Vangelis piece, \\"Opening\\" was played which lent a poignant, almost tearful feel to the event.  Only 18 horses drowned and all the rest were rescued.
B000005YZM|5.0|And missing this--a masterpiece that deserves to be celebrated and cherished alongside the other subdued, seemless and flawless conceptual recordings of the period: Small Faces' \\"Ogden Nut Gone Flake,\\" Love's \\"Forever Changes,\\" The Kink's \\"Are the Village Green Preservation Society,\\" Family's \\"Music in a Doll's House,\\" The Pretty Things' \\"S.F. Sorrow,\\"...and dare I add Bob Dylan's \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and the Rolling Stones' \\"Beggars Banquet.\\" Wear beige fatigues dyed in the weariness and vague self-assurance that comes from resisting (or overcoming) flower power frivolity, feel the breeze caressing your face, and tangle in body and mind with the double-edged nature of real sensuality. Leave the children's stuff for the kids, and take the REAL trip with this \\"Odessey and Oracle.\\" You'll return a being deeper freer.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|How often do we watch a movie of the Irish Mafia?  I'll bet there are many who didn't know it existed. Yet every Mafia birthed due to lack of sustanence, whether the Italian's needing to survive in Cicely, or the Irish needing a foot hold in the US.  The fact that the two FBI protagonists are both also Irish, adds brilliance to the tension. The cast would have been hard to best. Jack Nichelson was in top form. DiCaprio, I thought would literally break from stress. and me....clutching my knees, eyes wide..and by the way, a person who hates bloody violence, found that there was nothing gratuitous about this movie's depiciton of the bloody mayhem that has existed and still does within the Irish Mafia.  One young man I spoke with, about the movie, said that he found there was too much shooting in the head.  I reminded him that execution is usually a bullet in the head.
B0002KVUKW|2.0|Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough \\"quiet\\" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in \\"dark-o-vision\\"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The \\"face in the sky\\" ending was embarressing.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|Maybe I saw a different movie because I thought this was one of the worst I have seen in a long time.  I didn't get the love story, Ferrell and Gyllenhaal had no chemistry.  Ferell wasn't even funny.  I saw this movie with my husband and his parents.  I was the only one who stayed awake.
B000002JSN|5.0|I have listened to many albums in my day, and I consider myself as one having an appreciation for quality music and excellent talent.  My collection includes all the greatest releases from the best bands.  None of them compare with Physical.  It is my \\"deserted-island\\" album, and for some reason it actually gets better each time I listen to it.
B0001AP12G|3.0|I'm going to say this to all these people who interject pointless reviews about Kanye that has nothing to do with the album: If you hate his music so much, why did you buy his album? People are making comments about Kanye like this some kind of message board of such.<br /><br />As for \\"The College Dropout\\", I found it to be a very solid debut. Perhaps overrated, in my opinion. What stands out to me is his production. Some of his production is nice. So what if he uses samples in his production. If that is his style, let him run with it. \\"Get 'Em High\\" has one of the best beats on here made by Kanye. While I believe some of his production is lackluster, like on \\"All Falls Down\\" and \\"The New Workout Plan\\".<br /><br />As for his lyrical skills. Some people do the \\"either love him or hate him\\" thing for Kanye. People love Kanye because he rhymes about alternative subjects, such as the obvious \\"Jesus Walks\\". As I said on my Lupe Fiasco review, just because you rhyme about something different than everybody else doesn't necessarly make you better than anyone else. I believe Kanye is an excellent rapper, but his mic skills are more limited than everyone in the world thinks. Also I seem to notice that people hate Kanye because they claim that his rhymes are arrogant. I do believe that is true, but everyone has a reason to be arrogant. Kanye just lets a lot of heat off his chest in a direct way, possibly because he was affected by past events in his life. Hey, I'm not mad at his arrogance, because a lot of what he says I can relate to.<br /><br />As for bad songs, I can name a lot. As mentioned before \\"Jesus Walks\\", I found that the be one of the most overrated songs that I heard 2004. It was a good song, but everyone played it into the ground. A few more songs that I had no feel to was \\"The New Workout Plan\\", \\"Breathe In Breathe Out\\", \\"All Falls Out\\" (another song I thought was overrated, thanks to BET). The good songs was \\"We Don't Care\\" which I thought was good and entertaining. \\"Spaceship\\" with GLC and Consequence, which I could relate to as well. One I really enjoyed was \\"Family Business\\" which was very laid back and excellent song put together.<br /><br />The College Dropout to me was solid. People love it or hate it, but I find this in the middle. Kanye has skill to carry an entire album, lyrically and production wise, as it was shown on his debut. I personally like \\"The Late Registration\\" better than this, and is looking foward to his third album \\"The Freshman Adjustment\\". This CD had an effect on me in so many ways. I recommend that you don't play this CD right after you graduate high school (like I did, lol). Some of the skits \\"School Sprit Skit\\" are somewhat kind of wasteful (hey I've been in College going on three years). So I don't think anyone should take them seriously. Another dissapointmet was that a week befor the CD came out, The Music Choice Channel played a song with him and ODB called \\"Keep The Receipt\\" that didn't make the final cut (I liked that song). I have no bias against Kanye, and I enjoyed this album.<br /><br />In response to one reviewer: When you mention the track that follows \\"Jesus Walks\\" as \\"a track about getting falacio\\" I'm guessing you are talking about \\"The New Workout Plan\\" which does not follow \\"Jesus Walks\\".<br /><br />Lyrics: B<br /><br />Production: B+<br /><br />Guest Appearances: B+<br /><br />Musical Vibes: B<br /><br />Overall: B<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: We Don't Care, Spaceship, Never Let Me Down, Get Em' High, Slow Jamz (New Version), Two Words, Family Business<br /><br />Honorable Mention Tracks: Through The Wire, Last Call<br /><br />Peace Everyone!!!entertaining. \\"Spaceship\\" with GLC and Consequence, which I could relate to as well.

B00005K3NR|3.0|Carrie starts off like a skin flick with a bunch of girls in a locker room running around in slow motion with complete full frontal nudity. One good thing about this is at least women weren't ashamed to have pub/ic hair back then.  <br /> <br />De Palma loves his sex and nudity. This isn't the first movie that opens up inappropriately (Dressed to Kill). <br /> <br />Sissy Spacek gives a very sympathetic performance as the telekinetic outsider who just wishes to be normal and liked; not to mention really loved by her deranged mother. Piper Laurie gives a great performance playing a very extreme religious fundamentalist. And no idiots, her portrayal is not accurate of Christianity or conservatism, and anyone who would say so is saying more about their mental disorder than about religion. <br /> <br />There are several instances of comic relief, including the girl who wears a red baseball cap everywhere: I wonder why she wasn't the one picked on. And the principal who continues to call Carrie Cassie despite being told ad nauseam what her real name is. And my favorite: the negotiation on the steps between the prom committee chair and the devious dude who wants to help corrupt the prom king/queen voting. <br /> <br />The movie as a whole is good, but not great. De Palma's directing style is too shoddy and crude for it to be great.  <br /> <br />The DVD includes interesting details about the differences between film and book; and some documentaries about filming. <br /> <br />
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This movie is a cult classic! For any real Johnny Depp fan, it's a must-have! That man can make even the lamest movie good. Sure...it's really cheesy, but it's just so much fun!!! The cast is great...they're all a little crazy (some alot crazy) but you'll love them. And the songs are something else.  I mean that in a good way. It's sort of an aquired taste, I guess you could say, but I've always loved everything about this movie! I was nine years old when I first saw it. My mother used to rent it for me at the video store almost every weekend...I was obsessed! It just got to the point when she just had the video store order me a copy (back then you couldn't buy most new releases for months after they came out). I watched the tape SO many times that eventually, over the years, I wore it out. So when they finally came out with the DVD, I was ecstatic!!! I wouldn't say I'm obsessed anymore, but it's definitely one of my all time favorite movies. If you haven't seen it yet, please make it a point to watch it...at least once. You'll either love it, or you'll hate it. There's no in between. But I think you'll love it (even though you may not want to admit it).
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I ended up fast forwarding until the plot started tieing the four separate storylines together (about 1/2 way through the movie) and by then I didn't care any more. The plot drags and it is like watching TV with some one who can't keep his hands off the remote, shifting back and forth between 4 different movies.  <br /> <br />I am not easily offended, but the total nudity of Rinko Kikuchi acting as a deaf 16 year old offended me. I realize she is older than that in real life, but protraying her as a high school girl made me feel dirty, like I was watching kiddie porn. There are a lot better ways to spend your time than watching this junk (like spending an hour and a half in freeway traffic). <br />
B000H7J9S0|4.0|Just watched this today on my ps-3 with 1 glitch when the preview of buna vista movies played it was in 5.1 audio however when the movie started <br />it was in stero and i had to manually select the audio which is the button under eject on ps-3's remote. Other than this small nusance the picture is spectaculart and terry gillium doesn't disapoint. <br />I would've given 5 stars if the disc worked perfectlly but am unsure if it's the disc or simply the ps-3...but as this is the only disc that's done it-even 8 below another buna vista disc didn't do this. <br /> <br />Great movie great picture but wonky audio-though after selecting the 5.1 track it played fine and sounded great.
0739334085|5.0|Barack Obama speaks quite clearly on quite a variety of subjects.  He does a lot of comparing our world to our historical world and discusses things that have worked for our country and things that have not worked.  He analyzes if depth some of our countries most pressing issues and provides a brief outline of possible solutions.  He is well versed and well though out.  \\"I don't have all the answers...\\" Barack says, which is one of the most honest things I have heard some out of any recent politician.  <br /> <br />For anyone looking at the upcoming presidential campaign--it is worth taking some time to listen to or read Barack's book.  He is full of common sense, is down to earth, hones, holds family values extremely high, and has an understanding of our country's political history (beyond what I have ever heard from any politician).  Barack is someone our country needs now, even if he does not become the president this time around.  He believes in our country, our values, and the foundations we were built on.  He sees things going wrong, just as many American's do, and he seems as though he wholeheartedly wants to do his best to improve the politics withing our country.  With his youth in his advantage--he provides us with a fresh outlook on how things can be changed in Washington, D.C.
0374105235|5.0|Every once in a while I come across a good book that I can't set down. This is one of those books. I stayed up till 4am one night/morning reading and being drawn into Ishael's world of drugs and violence. Growing up in Africa I was always intrigued and drawn to child soldiers but never understood what was going through thier heads and thier rational for what they did. This book revealed it all. As a soldier I love violence and war, this book satisfied my hunger. The book draws you into Ishmael's world and you understand why he kills and why he feels such hatred and you almost relish the violence he creates. I would give this book 6 stars if I could. I don't like paying full price for books but wanted to read this book so I paid $22 at Starbucks and would buy it again. Seemed half the people in Starbucks were rivited to the book too.
B000J10ERO|3.0|I am a huge fan of the original Superman movies and obviously like any real fan I ignored the existence of Superman 3 & 4 since they were despicable garbage.  So, when this came out I figured OK, this is what Superman 3 should have / could have been. I went into it with the right mindset and realized that with all new actors and actresses that things were gonna be a little different.  I was actually OK with the casting changes for the most part.<br /><br />So, where to begin?  The storyline and \\"plot\\" were fairly cool with the crystals at the center of Luthers ploy. I enjoyed the scenes where Luther experiments with the power of the crystals.  These objects have been at the centerpiece of the film since the beginning so it was great seeing them being an integral part of this movie....NICE!  Speaking of Luther, Kevin Spacey did a pretty good job with the character.  This version of Luther was a little more sinister and not quite as \\"witty\\" as the Hackman versions but this was an acceptable change. Luther in this film was more of a real villian so to speak since he was a \\"darker\\" character.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth tried but just didnt cut it as Lois Lane.  That charcater has Margot Kidder written all over it and its not really Ms Bosworths fault... she just couldnt \\"revive\\" the Lois character for me. She was not as silly, loveable, or as interesting as the orginal.  What else can I say?  It just didnt work.  Brandon Routh was also a little out of place here. He was off just enough to make me miss Chris Reeve (RIP) and at times he appeared bored with the whole thing.  They could have worked with him more on playing the characters of Clark and Superman as they were quite different and this was missing somewhat in this film.  Routh wasnt awful by any means and he does look a lot like Reeve, it just missed the mark by enough to be noticed.  The rest of the cast was OK, nothing great but nothing terrible either.<br /><br />The CGI and effects were a mixed bag as usual with movies these days.  Some of the CGI worked well and sometimes it just looked like a video game. The problem with CGI is that its just soooooo obvious when its being used that it takes away from the realism of a scene because you KNOW that its totally computerized.  In the old days, we didnt know exactly how things were done so we were able to just watch the special effects and the mystery of how they \\"did that\\" kept us guessing.  Now, just about every shot with any kind of effects is CGI and it has that 2-dimensional, lifeless look to it that I have trouble with.  Oh well....<br /><br />There are a few surprises but most you could see coming a mile away. Still though, it did add some intrigue to the Superman saga and how his future may unfold. Plus, the ending is open enough that a lot more could happen and we may even see another film in this series someday.<br /><br />Overall, Brian Singer did a solid job with this film and thats saying a lot since things like this usually never get off the ground and are pretty awful.  Not so, its definitely worth a watch and after seeing it you can decide if its worth adding to your collection.  I might get it just to add it to my Superman 1 & 2 collection.sual with movies these days.  Some of the CGI worked well and sometimes it just looked like a video game.

0393061434|4.0|It's about entrepreneurship, and about being true to your values - what you hold to be important. <br /> <br />I am a few years older than Steve Wozniak but I identified very closely with his description of the time and the events of his life.  The passages and moral dilemmas of the time are shared experiences.  Having also a technical background in computers (mostly software) I found his recounting of the story to be directly of interest - learning about how it had happened and why.  The telling gets a bit detailed at times but that is part of the story.  (But, thank you for explaining to me why OS7 kept crashing.) <br /> <br />Readers with an entrepreneurial spirit will find the final chapter, \\"Rules to Live By\\", to be especially useful.  Although the author gets a bit rambling at this point, he makes several important points.  Possibly most important is, as an entrepreneur, his advice to believe in yourself and to not waver.  If you have an idea and believe in it, do it.  You can seek advice of others to refine your idea but stay true to your goal.  Other people will not see things the same and may say that it will never work - but that simply means that they are not you. <br /> <br />I do not agree with his advice that one must work alone.  (He did not, really.)  Working in collaboration builds strength - providing that there is synergy and shared goals and values.  Steve Wozniak would not have achieved the success that he did if he had not worked in collaboration with those with whom he did. <br /> <br />Overall, a good book that I appreciated and can recommend. <br />
B000002G0P|3.0|Extremes third LP was highly anticipated. After shifting serious units with their sophomore effort the band were on a roll. And on this album a number of Extremes points of reference are taken to their logical conclusion. Whether or not this works is very much a matter of taste. And since the band split the disc up into three conceptual sections, I'll do the same with putting into words my feelings towards different aspects of this disc.<br /><br />The Rock - Warheads is a great heavy rocker. Anti-authoritarian, anti-militaristic and dead on musically. This is a great and appropriate use of the bands rocking sensibilities and a dead ahead follow on from When I'm President from Pornograffiti. The spirit infuses Rest in Peace and Politicalamity, obvious results of the social concerns that started to be heard in tunes like Money (In God We Trust).<br /><br />The Ballads - Not so obvious here until you listen to how some of the songs are constructed. While this album isn't in posession of a More Than Words, the construction of many of the mellow cuts here do owe a big debt to the bands softer side. The fuller orchestration on some of the tracks are a true follow on from the soppy ballads from the bands previous disc.<br /><br />The Brains - once again you get the feeling that this band, musically and intellectually, were way above the norm for the usually numbskull hair metal genre which they were so unfairly lumped in with. Approaching Queen in some ways, Extreme are here bursting at the seams of possibility and daring their fan base to follow.<br /><br />The potential downsides here are a lack of getting down to business, not much headbang for your buck. And the pretentiousness that this release feels steeped in, well it's never gone down well with the hard rock community. And without the sappy ballads to get the little girls buying it the bands target audience for this album is hard to guage. After all, though Brian May all but publicly bequethed Extreme the crown worn by Queen, the fans of Queen were unlikely to appreciate a new band taking over the niche of their heroes. And all the pontificating does get overmuch very quickly.<br /><br />Call me a philistine, but having quite enjoyed their first two, after hearing this album I didn't buy any more Extreme. Neither did most other people. A sadly derailed release from a multi-talented band.crown worn by Queen, the fans of Queen were unlikely to appreciate a new band taking over the niche of their heroes.

B000002GK1|5.0|Before Soundgarden exploded with rest of the Seatle scene on the breakthrough album, \\"Superunknown,\\" they got a massive headstart with \\"Badmotorfinger.\\" Recorded and released in 1991, \\"Badmotorfinger\\" not only stands the test of time as an album that still sounds fresh and original, but is also arguably the group's best work. Not only are there some memorable and iconic radio hits to be found on here, there is also extremely tight musicianship. Soundgarden were pretty much the only band that knew how to fuse metal and classic rock influences with the grunge sound of the 90's and do it right. Whether you agree about it being their best or not, \\"Badmotorfinger\\" exercises that skill the best out of all their releases.<br /><br />The fact that two of the band's trademark (and two of their best songs) -- \\"Rusty Cage\\" and \\"Outshined\\" -- open the album doesn't hinder the rest of the material, mainly because it's all just as good. Songs like \\"Slaves & Bulldozers,\\" \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" and \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" are just as good and help to epitomize what Soundgarden are all about: Driving riffs and soaring vocals. \\"Room A Thousand Years Wide\\" is the track that guitarist Kim Thayil truly gets his chance to shine, even going as far as overshadowing Chris Cornell's voice, which is not an easy task. \\"Drawing Flies\\" is the most unlike the rest of the bunch, with it's fast and meaty guitar that sounds like a lost Tony Iommi riff. \\"Mind Riot,\\" however, shows the shape of what was to come for the band, slowing down and getting a little more subdued, but not quite up to the standards of \\"Black Hole Sun.\\"<br /><br />\\"Badmotorfinger\\" may not be the best album for a new Soundgarden fan to pick up, as the sound explored here doesn't apply to their most popular work, but anyone who has given this and the rest of the Soundgarden discography a listen can't deny that it's a force to be reckoned with. In an essence, it's the perfect rock record. The exact album to be putting on when you crave something that truly rocks without any pretensions or frills. If there is still classic rock radio in the future, I can only how bad it will be saturated with these songs.hen you crave something that truly rocks without any pretensions or frills.

B000002GJ7|4.0|Extremes second album blew the doors off their at times one dimensional debut. The tunes, playing and vibe of this album betray a band reaching out, playing great hard rock that's almost too great, the band showing they are almost too talented for their chosen environs.<br /><br />All up this disc gives the listener a very full experience. It addresses a range of styles within the hard rock genre. We get racy hard rockers such as Decadence Dance, Get the Funk Out and six string freak out He-Man Woman Hater. We score sappy ballads in Song for Love (hurl inducing), Hole Hearted (amusing and nifty) and More than Words (destined to be on radio until the end of time). And it's this mixture of hard rock fun and inclusive mellow cuts that realy makes this album. A few of the numbers don't work, the aforementioned Song for Love being overwrought and the actual title track is a bit wonky, but such is the breezy, carefree delivery that the listener doesn't really notice, instead focussing on the good tunes here.<br /><br />The playing on this disc is lovely - the show of course stolen by Gary Cherones' smooth vocal stylings and Nunos six string histrionics. And the whole shebang is crystal clear, sporting production by Michael Wagener - though tracks 9 and 13 were twiddled by Nuno. And this clear production helps the listener appreciate the way Extreme were able to shift up and down the gears.<br /><br />For all the success of a couple of it's ballads it would be wrong to consign Extreme to some sort of soft rock compilation hell. This was a working rock band that could kick some serious backside. The rockers here are like an expanding of the horizons of the rockers of their debut while the continued use of funky time signatures and overtones gives this album some serious mobility. All spiced up with a hint of the tackling of serious issues which would come so much to the fore on their third LP.<br /><br />With this album.... oh I'm sick of typing - just pick this album up for a good listen OK?um up for a good listen OK?
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I found this film tremendously entertaining and even enthralling when I first saw it as a teenager. It's held up surprisingly well for me over the years, and not all for nostalgic and sentimental reasons. The movie combines many intriguing themes and elements--the mystery of an advanced but vanished race, attacks by an unseen force, some very cool special effects, the ravishing Ann Francis, and considering it was \\"just\\" a low budget B movie, a pretty stellar cast with Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielson, and as I said Ann Francis--to produce one of the great B sci-fi movies of the period, and one which really transcends the modest pretentions of that oft-maligned genre. And last but not least, the scene with the I.Q. measuring machine even pokes fun at the captain. :-)<br /><br />Then there was Robbie the robot, who went on to appear in several other venues (including a very corny Lost in Space episode some years later, but I guess Robbie's career was on the skids by that time :-)). The movie's climax is exciting as well as different from the other sci-fi movies of the day, but I won't say anything further on that so as not to provide any spoilers, except to say that it had more do to with inner space than outer space. And finally, the energy ray gun and the flying saucer spaceship are two very cool special effects. All in all still a great classic from the golden age of B science fiction movies and still worth watching today.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Peter Mayle's popular novel 'A Year in Provence' has been transferred to the screen by screenwriter Marc Klein under the odd direction of Ridley Scott, best known for such films as 'Hannibal', 'Gladiator', 'Matchstick Men', 'Thelma and Louise', 'Black Hawk Down', 'Blade Runner' etc. and the result may surprise many viewers.  No, this is not a shocker of a film but rather a too familiar tale of a man obsessed with making money who inherits a vineyard and chateau in Provence from the uncle that served as his family as a child and in returning to the old estate, finds the earth and his memories too long buried about how he loved the space of arrested time of his childhood.<br /><br />The man is British financial wizard Max Skinner (Russell Crowe in a very subdued performance) who as a young bright lad (Freddie Highmore) lived with Uncle Henry Skinner (Albert Finney), learning the ins and outs of growing grapes and making wine.  Max returns to the chateau after Uncle Henry's death with all intentions of polishing up the neglected place to place on the market to make yet more money.  The live-in couple who maintain the place (Francis Duflot - Didier Bourdon - and his wife Ludivine - Isabelle Candelier) challenge Max's decision to sell the place, hiding some secrets about the vintages that will eventually alter the course of the story.  Max slowly falls in love with his memories of his childhood, reconnecting with his love for his uncle, discovering a young beauty Fanny (Marion Cotillard) who owns a bistro and was actually a childhood 'friend' to Max, and also discovering that the philandering uncle had an illegitimate daughter Christie (Abbie Cornish) who visits the chateau to get to know who her father was (bringing along a deep knowledge of winemaking from California's Napa Valley!).  The film is then a struggle between Max's obsession with money as abetted by his home coworkers Gemma (Archie Panjabi) and Charlie (Tom Hollander) and his changing need and love for the life and memories bound tightly to his Provence chateau.  How it all works out is the relaxing if predictable finale of the story.<br /><br />The cast is attractive (including even a bit part for the beautiful and talented Valeria Bruni Tedeschi!) and seem to meld with Ridley Scott's concept of offering a little fluff of French dessert.  It is light in vein but beautiful to look at and it is interesting to see Scott and Crowe together in a non-violent venture!

B00006LLLN|5.0|I love these cd's because Allison's voice is so stirring. She's backed up by extremely talented musicians. The kind of music you can actively listen to.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD since I bought it last week. The songs just touch my soul with their beauty. It's a combination of the lyrics, the masterful musical arrangements, and the voices of Hansard and Irglova. <br />The songs are quite a departure for Glen Hansard. As the lead singer of the great Dublin band, The Frames, he is known for his emotional singing, yet his voice is often strained. Here he is subdued, subtle and filled with much more emotion.  <br />And what can I say about the voice of Marketa Irglova? It is like an angels, particularly on Alone Apart.   <br />Many of the songs on the CD are sung by the duo in the forthcoming film \\"Once\\". All I can say is I can't wait to see the film.
B00000AOUD|5.0|John Evans is one of the best and most unknown/underrated keyboardists of his time. His Organ work was truly exceptional, and this is his best. I recommend this and \\"A Passion Play\\", for students of the keyboard.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I don't think this decade has had much success with romantic comedies, but trust me that with \\"The Holiday\\", the 2000s have never looked better. I consider this film to be one that extracts the finest performances from Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz EVER, and once you see it, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Kate Winslet has acted in many good movies (\\"Hideous Kinky\\", \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"Iris\\") but its ironic that her most poignant and well-written role comes in \\"The Holiday\\". You probably know the story already - its about two women on two different continents who swap houses and lives after a chance meeting on the Internet - but the treatment and above all, the DIALOGUE, is what drives this romantic comedy to the heights of that most rare animal - a cinema classic.<br /><br />And thats what \\"The Holiday\\" is. I honestly think that a genuine, feel-good film such as this should be embraced by the Oscar group, instead of their focus on typical epic films such as \\"Babel\\" and \\"Gladiator\\". This is where the magic is. Cameron Diaz especially, has never found a better vehicle for her goofy charm (yes, this is even better - staggeringly better than \\"There's Something About Mary\\"). Jude Law, who has had his share of incredible dramatic performances in films such as \\"Wilde\\" and \\"Alfie\\", uses his effortless charm and natural screen presence to radiate such magnetism, that he is undeniably the most spot-on best romantic lead you would have seen for a while.<br /><br />Audiences I saw this with claimed that \\"The Holiday\\" was at least twice as better than \\"Pretty Woman\\". No comparison. The films I consider really good romantic comedies would be \\"Never Been Kissed\\", \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\" and \\"Theres Something About Mary\\". However, \\"The Holiday\\" is all that, but the amazing thing is that it has a heart of gold and does NOT rely upon slapstick humor to make the dialogue and situations work.<br /><br />Kate Winslets' character in fact, is one worth coming back to and studying, even from a film students' perspective. She infuses her role with so much wit and warmth, that we do not mind if this girl even ends up single in the movie - we just want her to find herself. The scene where she dumps her boyfriend after three years of emotional abuse is absolutely wondrous - the actress glows and gives off such electric spark that its impossible not to FEEL for this beautiful character.<br /><br />Jack Black, in a superb cinematic role as a Hollywood music industry biggie, is never meant to be taken seriously as a love interest for Kate, much as some would like to think so. Their sad tale is of two people in two different bad relationships finding a friend again - I loved how the end of this movie did not strive to hurriedly bring two people together - rather, it allows space for the characters to breathe and live their emotions, which is why its so easy to take this film seriously, and which is why you MUST watch it.<br /><br />Finally a film worth buying! I have waited so long for a movie of such depth, grace and respect for the art of film-making.<br /><br />There are so many amazing scenes here - Kate in her quaint cottage trying to commit suicide (a poignant moment filled with humor and grief all at the same time), Kate waking up in the lap of luxury in Los Angeles, the initial meeting between Cameron and Jude and their wondrous chemistry, the moment where they realize they are in love with each other, the moment where Cameron meets Jude's kids, and her ultimate realization that her selfish, unloving persona has been undone by this mans' love - and the scene where she leaves it all behind to run back to the person she loves the most. There are SO many such moments during this movie. Consider this a return to form for Hollywood in general.<br /><br />I would especially like to thank the makers of \\"The Holiday\\". I don't know if any of them read Amazon reviews, but as a critic of film, I find it so hard to like so many of the \\"serious\\" filmsout there today. Most of them are made to win Oscars, and then there are those tailormade to win Academy Awards. Either way, they're made to win something. And then you have the disposable comedies of the \\"Scary Movie\\" variety. But a film such as this makes me realize that the glory days of the 1950s and 60s of Hollywood still exist.<br /><br />I must also state here that I only saw this film because I saw that it starred Kate Winslet. This is one actress that has never let me down throughout her amazing career - and to find that she gave her best ever performance in this film made me all the more happier. She takes a beaten down, funnily written character and transforms her into a woman of great intelligence and feeling - this is NOT Bridget Jones' Diary!<br /><br />Which is why its obvious why these stars signed up for a movie such as this. On the face of it, \\"The Holiday\\" is a two-story arc that converges into one in the end - about the love lives of two very different women. But it is so much more than that - in fact, it is a meditation on love and hope in this day and age.<br /><br />If my praise seems extravagant, all I can say is, buy this. Do not rent it, buy it. It is the pinnacle of working excellence for all three major stars - Jude, Kate and Cameron, and it is by far the best romantic comedy of the 2000s by a long shot. Also, I find it hard to believe that anything more amazing than this would be released anytime this year.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. Five Stars. Hollywood finally redeems itself and gets it right.\\"serious\\" films out there today. Most of them are made to win Oscars, and then there are those tailormade to win Academy Awards.

0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand is a controversial author. She is a polarizing author; readers tend to love her or hate her. However, if you could undo the prejudices of her reputation and just read her work you would find that many of the naysayers would become fans. I had the opportunity to read The Fountainhead without knowing much about Rand and her politics. I fell in love with the ideas presented in the novel: creativity, individualism, and a rejection of the status quo. Having since read into her philosophy (objectivism) I could not read Atlas Shrugged with same eyes. Whether the trouble lies with the novel itself or my foreknowledge of an agenda, I did not enjoy Atlas Shrugged as much as The Fountainhead.<br /><br />Back to the book...<br />The Fountainhead is a stunning novel that explores the nature of individuality through the unforgettable character of Howard Roark. Roark is an architect who desires to build something unlike what anyone else has. Though it costs him greatly he refuses to abide by tradition.<br /><br />The magnitude of this book is incredible. Though it was written over 60 years ago, it's just as vivid and relevant today. Ayn Rand created a genius tale full of intriguing characters, masterful plots, and ideas that really make one think. This is one of those rare books that haunts you and begs to be re-read.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Hugh Grant singing? Now that we know he can, lets discover some more of the gems on this beautiful new CD Release. \\"Music and Lyrics\\" has three highlights and heres what they are:<br /><br />1. The lead single : \\"Way Back into Love\\" sung by Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. This playful version is the original film version and its just really exhilirating when you play this loud and sing along. I suspect this song was made simply for the purpose of people humming it all day long and breaking out into song at randoms spots of the day. Truly memorable and an instantly catchy pop ballad - this is actually better than most of the idiotic stuff clogging radio airwaves these days.<br /><br />2. \\"Buddha's Delight\\" by Cora (Haley Bennett) : I just loved this character in the movie. She is a satiric amalgamation of Britney, Jessica, Mandy and Beyonce, all in one gratingly annoying package. However, this song (which is based on Britney's \\"Toxic\\" in terms of verse-chorus-verse) is very, very catchy, and its also the best thing on the record. You will be playing this all day long, and kids will love it too. I really like how every song on this record could have been a radio single, and this song is the lead candidate for it. In fact, this song is the reason why I bought this album, and why you should too<br /><br />3. \\"POP Goes my Heart\\" - This exceptional 1980s-type pop song evokes the best bands of that era, primarily Duran Duran, A-Ha and Cutting Crew. What a song! This opens the album and let me tell you - its a single that you will remember ten years from now (fact!). Hugh Grant actually sings on this, and has never sounded better. This is my second favorite song on the record, and another reason you should get this!<br /><br />The other stunners on this album are \\"Don't Write Me Off\\" - an Elton John-ish number by Hugh Grant, and another catchy hook that you will love singing to yourself in the shower.<br /><br />Drew Barrymore doesn't sing much on this CD - that right goes mostly to Hugh Grant, but she does not sound too terrible. However, the real find here is Haley Bennett who plays Cora, as her numbers have been produced very well.<br /><br />If you don't normally like movie soundtracks, or even if you do, take my word for it and get yourself a copy of this CD. Its got this timeless quality about it, and I am sure I will be playing this years from now. How many CDs out this year can you say that about?<br /><br />Five Stars. Highly Recommended.ght goes mostly to Hugh Grant, but she does not sound too terrible.

B000MQQMMW|5.0|it's an awesome show!!! but what's on the bonus disc? is it for real or what?
B000GG4XJM|5.0|okay, okay, okay. i was very mad to see such a crass move on bruce's part: releasing the same album he released last year with 5 additional tracks so that the hardcore fan would have to buy the album AGAIN if he wanted a definitive copy, i.e. the five extra tracks. absolutely no doubt: these five extra tracks should have been released as an EP. that would have been the sensible and decent thing to do for fans. well, that was not the path taken, and as a longtime fan of bruce, i am mad. first the terrible idea of the dual disc format (these discs do NOT play on all cd players), now this. that said, the five extra tracks DO make this album an even better thing. the original release of this recording was my favorite album of 2006, and my favorite bruce album in over 20 years. mad and irritated as i am about the way these extra tracks were offered up, forcing me to buy material I had already paid for once before, i am oddly pleased all the same to have more of a good thing. twisted, right?
B00005QXDD|5.0|This was Tenacious D's first full album, and they really got it right.  This has rock, good comedy skits, and overall a blend of potty humor and sheer genious to make you laugh your socks off. Highlights of this album are kielbasa, tribute, the road, and F*** Her Gently.  All of the other stuff is really good also, and I can listen to this album several times in a row and still laugh.  Check this out, if you like jack black, and even if you don't, this will make you laugh. Buy this now.
0743454537|2.0|First I'll say this is the first (and probably only) Jodi Picoult novel I've ever read.  I'm not usually a fiction reader but this book was recommended to me after my daughter was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. <br /> <br />While I think the storyline is a good one (and I don't even mind the ending) the writing is HORRIBLE.  I can't even count the number of cheesy, obvious \\"ironies\\" and \\"foreshadowing\\".  I'd say this book is about the level of reading for an 8th grader, if you took out the few \\"f words\\" and sexually suggestive \\"scenes\\". <br /> <br />As for \\"scenes\\", that's my next point - this book was so OBVIOUSLY written to be turned into a Lifetime movie it isn't funny.  Each chapter is from a different characters' first person point-of-view, and there is not much besides dialog and flashbacks.  <br /> <br />I feel like the time I spent reading this book was a waste - if someone had simply taken 5 to 10 minutes to tell me a detailed synopsis, I'd feel just as satisfied. <br /> <br />
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Of all the actors to make this caracter come to life, Will Farrell was a perfect fit. This movie is funny and original.  This movie follow Harold Crick, an IRS auditor through his daily routine, until something unique happens to him, his watch dies.  That's not unique, well neither is his life...except that he has a narrator.  Rent this movie, buy this movie, find out what this is all about.  My only small flaw with this film is that it could have cut the last part of the ending and been just fine, but this is a fitting ending as well. Rent this find out what happens to Harold Crick.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|After many years of not seeing this movie, I stumbled across my old VHS collection, and decided to put Titanic in yet again. Immediately, I was so captivated; it was almost like I had never seen it before. Then I remembered just how fond I was of the movie even when I was young (I was only 11 when it came out!). At the time, I was too young to comprehend many subtle details and lacked the experience of life to really grasp the meanings in much of the movie. Now, more mature, this work has me spellbound. It was immediately after this revived viewing that I purchased the Collector's DVD set. And I'm glad I did. <br />The movie comes to life far better in DVD. The bonuses are amazing and amongst the best I have ever seen in DVD special features. <br /> <br />And about the movie, so many people quibble about the length of the movie, yet for all its worth, it could have been so much longer, and still have been fantastic. The 3+ hours running time is an excellent medium, and is ultimately necessary for the viewer to be engaged to the modern world, the Titanic's story (told by the now ancient Rose), the tragedy that followed, and the powerful impact that the voyage had on the life of young Rose and others. <br /> <br />On a different note, the visuals are amazing, no question about it. Even though we are all aware that is is not the RMS Titanic, immediately, the mind is transplanted and the time feels real. The ship looks and feels real. The people on ship feel real. Rarely can a film do this; take one setting and make it so compelling and marvelous, but James Cameron accomplished this in so many ways.  <br /> <br />The story, following the main composite characters of Jack and Rose is second to none in my opinion. They provide and excellent conduit to see the world that this ship encompassed, everything from the style of the era, the type and diversity of the people aboard, the grandeur and significance of the ship, the layers of the ship itself and so on. Furthermore, webecome so captivated in their story (now that I'm older, I can appreciate and understand to the nth degree) that by the tragic end, their relationship is beautiful yet so very bittersweet. Also, the premise that true love can change the lives of others feels so real, making the ending (and the entire movie) simply superb, powerful, moving, and astonishingly beautiful. <br /> <br />And an often overlooked aspect, which really drew me back into Cameron's epic, is the absolutely gripping and appropriate all-time highest selling score by James Horner. The soundtrack fits all the themes of the movies, and is so powerful because of this; love, changing, distant memories, tragedy, are all expressed so perfectly.. Coupled with the acting, it is such a powerful mechanism. One of the best, in my opinion. <br /> <br />After all of this, I realize that this is such a timeless and classic movie. To reject it is to be devoid of one of the best movies in decades, and simply one of the most powerful ever made.
0596007124|5.0|My first experience with a Head First book, and it is quite like a Dummies book (only for techies).  That description doesn't really do the work justice, however.  It is not just the concepts presented, nor is it the code examples they give (in Java).  The clarity comes with the real-world examples where they lead you to a conclusion, then present the answer. <br /> <br />It is well thought out, and tons of fun to read.  I would recommend it to ANY OO developer looking for a solid foundation to learn more about design patterns.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I thought this was an entertaining, engrossing film, with enough of a plot twist to keep us engaged, and a freshing formalism to the script -- particularly in its use of plot symmetries and (metaphorical) mirror-image contrasts.  The acting was quite nice -- although the younger actors are all a tad callow, Michael Caine and David Bowie were both delightful onscreen, each stealing the show in his own way.  This is hardly a masterpiece or an immortal work of cinema, but it's several notches above the current state of action-suspense dramas, mid-decade in the '00s.  Definitely worth checking out.
0743289412|3.0|C'mon it's Stephen King so you know that you want to read it. Having read all of his books this certianly wasn't my favorite but after a while it did pick up the pace and added a little Stephenesque twist to it. It's not that the book was bad it just was not what I'm used to (expect really) from a Stephen King novel. Now I know that he wants to diversify himself by writing novels such as this, but he is truly the best at scary and not only do I want to read it I crave it! Anyway, enough ranting, if you liked Hearts in Atlantis then you'll like Lisey's Story, just don't go into it thinking its another \\"Bag of Bones\\".

B0000669JL|5.0|Many reviews have pointed out the huge significance and influence of Bob Marley's music.  I just want to say that even though I have many CDs of his wonderful music, including interesting collections of early songs, if I had to keep just one CD, it would be Legend.<br /><br />Marley even did an album in an earlier style, called Rock Steady, with one of his greatest songs: \\"Caution.\\"  Collections of earlier music include some of Marley and the Wailer's covers of soul classics which are excellent.<br /><br />However, Legends clearly has his greatest songs including \\"Three Little Birds,\\" \\"Exodus,\\" and many others which other reviewers have elucidated quite well.<br /><br />I was surprised that the others did not emphasize my all-time favorite Marley song: \\"No woman, no cry.\\"  The live version in Legends is perfection in music.  To sum it up, anyone who is at all interested in Reggae music must have this CD.

038073186X|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Dennis Lehane (Mystic River was simply brilliant) but Shutter Island is a little too gimmicky to even think of as a genuine novel.  It's just a big set-up for a plot twist that fans of the genre will see coming a mile away.<br /><br />If Lehane weren't such a skilled writer, this novel would warrant a much lower rating.  The final chapters (following the big plot twist) almost made me forgive the predictable twists and turns of the first 2/3 of the novel.  These pages literally ache with such a profound pain and sadness that it seemed a shame to waste them in a novel that is little more than a parlor trick.<br /><br />Shutter Island is haunting and deeply affecting at times, but all in all, the novel is little more than smoke and mirrors.  If you haven't read anything by this author, I recommend you start with Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone.
B000M06K5C|3.0|Honestly, I was so disappointed in this new album that I had to listen to \\"Silent Alarm\\" again --just to redeem the band in my mind. I saw them play Alarm live too, and it was awesome! However in \\"Weekend,\\" the lyrics were down-right boring and formulated. There are a few catchy bits -- like in \\"Hunting for Witches\\" -- which were reminiscent of Silent, but overall, I would wait to buy this CD real cheap or check out a friend's copy first.<br /><br />It's definitely NOT anything like Silent Alarm --if that's what you were looking for, but perhaps it will grow on me...

This book panders to our middle class concept that OUR financial success, OUR weight, OUR wants, are the thoughts on which we should concentrate.

B000LC4CVA|3.0|The DVD/CD is good with only a few new songs, and too many american classics.  Skip the live show just watch the DVD.  We went to Baltimore to see them and they copied the DVD every inch of the way.  The girls never spoke a single word to the audience.  Not One.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|This album is so sweet and beautiful. The gentle nuances of Bruni's voice move you to fall in love with your surroundings. it really is so beautiful it makes you want to cry.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Emma is a great movie for anyone that loves Jane Austen books. Gwyenth is at her best and makes this a funny, and sweet romance.
B000FZEQS2|1.0|A very god movie as far as content, but terrible picture quality as far as it being high def. I would have to say don't waste your $$ on the HD-DVD version and just by the regular DVD, they both have the same picture quality.
B000006OAM|2.0|I love KIND AND GENEROUS and THE GOLDEN BELLS, but otherwise, the songs on this album plod along - too sad and heavy!  They are so similar to one another and soooooooo melancholy.  Very disappointing!  NM has such a beautiful voice, but it is torture to listen to this album.
B000002U9E|5.0|I bought this in 1986, having heard Bill Humphries sing the praises of Kate Bush for months. It was the Spring-Summer of my triumphant return to UT Austin (before the inevitable Second Fall from Grace that was to occur a couple of years later), and while I had listened to this album quite a bit during my commute back and forth to classes that Spring, it cemented its hold in my heart during Winedale summer, as I prepared for the Shakespeare course that Mike Godwin had instructed me to enroll in during the Spring, then followed up for an intensive Summer section. Listening to it now reminds me of that summer, especially the first song, \\"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\\" and the entire \\"Ninth Wave\\" second half, in that I had indeed made a deal with God that I would try and turn my school life around and I was immersed, not so much in water, but in the creativity and spirit of Winedale. The album is somewhat bittersweet, and so was that summer, for while I indeed did well that year, it was a rough period, made more so by the ties I had been making with my girlfriend of the time (who would eventually become my wife, uhm, ten years later).<br /><br />I had been primed to fall for the Divine Miss Bush for years, having spent my high school years listening to a progression of pop music (Elton John and Fleetwood Mac) to \\"hard rock\\" (Styx and Journey) to \\"art rock\\" (Genesis, Rush and Yes). The next step along that road was to experimental rock, and Laurie Anderson had been my introduction and Kate Bush became my guide in the form. At the time, since I hadn't heard much of Bush's previous work, I simply saw her as a companion to Peter Gabriel (she had, after all, performed a duet with him on his recent album, So, as had Anderson), who also went into the studio to drench her songs in layers and layers of production. The strangeness of some of \\"The Ninth Wave\\" washed over me, and it wasn't until years later that I actually took notice of how many things were actually going on in those songs. Now that I look at this album and compare it to her previous work, I see how some had rightly accused Bush of \\"selling out\\" to pop music, much like they had accused Gabriel of the same (my favorite memory of which is my friend Karl Rehn's rewrite of the chorus of \\"Sledgehammer\\" as \\"I want to be / Phil Collins\\"). Hounds of Love is defiantly pop, but this is pop with an edge.<br /><br />Take, for example, the opening song, whose title was changed because her record company feared that \\"A Deal with God\\" would raise fundamentalist hackles in the States and Italy. Its insistent drum beat over the atmospheric synths belie the lyrics, which have nothing whatsover to do with the diety, but instead describe the love/hate symbiosis in most relationships. The titular deal is the narrator's urgent desire to be able to switch places, so as to better understand each other. (Of course, in all modesty, you could also read the lyrics as the narrator wanting to swap places with her lover so they could experience orgasm from each other's point of view. I'm just saying, and those moans in the background bear me out on this, I think.)<br /><br />\\"It's in the trees! It's coming!\\" What? This is a pop record? What was that? That was the beginning to the second song, \\"Hounds of Love,\\" that's even more over the top in its attempt to describe how much it feels to be the object of someone's affection, or perhaps the narrator's fear of being in love itself. As she runs from those hounds, she's unsure if she wants to be in love or to be pursued by love or to give in to her own feelings. I was 20, and in the throes of my first love affair, and I knew how she felt to be hounded by love.<br /><br />\\"The Big Sky\\" changes the mood to be a little more light-hearted, almost childish, as the narrator rolls in the grass and focuses her attention on the shapes that she can see in the clouds. What I like most about this song is the vocal nonsense sounds in the background that are almostlike Philip Glass in their repetition. Each of these first three songs are \\"big music,\\" in the phraseology of Mike Scott of the Waterboys: they fill the room/car/arena with their sounds, so much so that the louder you play the song the more you hear going on.<br /><br />But, as celebratory as the last song was, Bush quickly turns to a darker subject, and one of my favorite songs she has ever done, \\"Mother Stands for Comfort.\\" Unlike the ambiguous nature of the first couple of songs, it's not hard to follow the lyrics on this one: from the breaking glass at the beginning, to the industrial background sounds, this is a song about a broken person, who adores his mother who \\"knows that I've been doing something wrong / But she won't say anything.\\" In the chorus, the narrator even calls himself a madman. This is a sincerely creepy song, in which the music both supports its eerie theme as well as coats it over in slinkiness.<br /><br />From one child to another, \\"Cloudbusting\\" is told from the point-of-view of Peter Reich, the young son of Wilhelm Reich. Drawn directly from Peter's book about his experience, it tells the story of when the government agents came for his father, interspersed with a child's love for his father and the dreams his father had instilled in him. It's an effective piece in that it makes you want to know more about Reich and his beliefs about Organon.<br /><br />Thus ends side one on the album (for this was when artists still thought of Side A and Side B to match the order of songs on a piece of vinyl). Side B has an overall title of \\"The Ninth Wave,\\" and describes a shipwreck survivor lost at sea, struggling to keep his or her head above the water. The opening song, \\"And Dream of Sleep,\\" sets up this situation, and also manages to prefigure some of the experimental sections that follow in its small snippets of sound that merge into a collage all the while Bush sings sweetly about being seduced by sleep, which she cannot fall into lest she drop into the deep water and drown. The next section, \\"Under Ice,\\" is chilling (pun intended), for the water the protagonist is in is cold, and the very real danger that she faces is underpinned by the minor key and urgent violin part. \\"Waking the Witch\\" puts the sound collage in the foreground, like a view into the protagonist's mind, a jumble of phrases and voices that abruptly seques into a call and response between a sinister male-type voice and a desperately stuttering staccato female voice, separated by sections of childlike chanting. This is the weirdest song on this album, and while there's nothing as outre in it as the braying donkey in \\"Get Out of the House\\" on The Dreaming, it would be hard to describe this as pop. (Interestingly enough, it's theme of judge and jury and the helicopter sample that ends it recalls, unintentionally I think, Pink Floyd's The Wall.) Returning to a more sedate, if still not normal, mood, \\"Watching You Without Me\\" starts as a lullabye, broken by a bridge of either nonsense or foreign lyrics not repeated in the liner notes as well as a repeat of the stuttering \\"talk to me, talk to me, talk to me\\" heard earlier. The point of the song, I think, is to provide a calm trough between \\"Waking the Witch\\" and \\"Jig of Life,\\" the latter being a minor-key and darkly urgent variation on the traditional jig. By this time, the drowning theme has been downplayed to some extent, as these middle songs likely portray an inner struggle in the protagonist. \\"Hello Earth\\" brings us back to the story, however, by an implied comparison of the drowning person in the overall black sea to the Earth in the inky depths of the Universe. \\"With just one hand held up high / I can blot you out / out of sight\\" is a line written as if the Earth is viewed from off-Earth (the Moon or a space capsule), and later in the song the viewer sees storms forming over America and tries to warn the sailors and other in the water, including the poor drowning person, who is in the path of the storm. And then the finale comes, like the calm following the storm, a simple love song that is either the protagonists parting thoughts or, if you want to believe that she is actually rescued before drowning, her affirmation of life and understanding of the tenuousness of our existence by reiterating what she plans to do: \\"I'll kiss the ground / I'll tell my mother / I'll tell my father / I'll tell my loved one / I'll tell my brothers / How much I love them.\\"<br /><br />Is this pop? Maybe, perhaps, somewhat. Bush had always played with pop music tropes from her first success, the book turned song \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" and each successive album contained some nods towards a simple ballad, but it wouldn't be until two albums following this one that Miss Bush would write her own \\"Sledgehammer\\" in \\"Rubberband Girl\\" (on The Red Shoes, an album that would also feature a song co-written and performed as a duet with his purpleness, Prince). To me, though, Hounds of Love is Bush's career high point, where her experimental art sensibilities were leavened with enough pop understanding to achieve a masterpiece of production, performance, and purpose, propelled with a singular power of vision and which wraps up in a peaceful platitude. Other albums contain highlights; only this one is perfection.st she drop into the deep water and drown.

B0009A40ES|5.0|Having read and enjoyed the novel, I had no idea what to expect of the movie.  However I was pleasantly suprised. American Psycho is not a novel I felt could be well made into a movie- much like Catch-22. But the movie for the most well catches the flavor and themes of the book, and replays some of the best parts of the novel. Christian Bale completely sells the role of Patrick Bateman- a highlight of the movie. The extras are extensive, and the documentaries are well worth watching.
0316776963|5.0|A hard-to-put-down hilarious book.  I've read it a few times.  A fun book to pass around groups, and then talk about favorite parts.
1400064287|5.0|The Heath brothers have written what I believe is a modern management masterpiece. I how them and so I have to confess I am biased, but at the same time, I know lots of other authors, and rarely review their books. Why do I think this is one of the most important management books you can own? <br /> <br />1. The ideas are evidence-based. Note that Chip Heath is a world class social psychologist.  In fact, his dissertation adviser was Amos Tversky, who would have won a Nobel Prize had he lived (this is not speculation, his co-author Daniel Kahneman won the prize in 2003 for their joint work.) As such, theor recommendations are all grounded in some of the most rigorous and well-grounded principles in the behavioral science literature. In a world where anyone can be a management expert -- including Tony Soprano --  it is essential to have ideas that are valid, yet rare. <br /> <br />2. The book is completely readable and understandable. It bewilders me when people complain that a management book is too approachable -- especially one that his ideas that are so sound. And the reason there are so many stories to go along with the evidence is that -- as the best evidence shows -- people remember stories, not statistics. <br /> <br />3. The final and most important thing about this book is that the ideas are more quickly and readily applied than any management book I know. When I just quickly go through the principles with managers or Stanford students, they move to application with impressive speed. Things like, if it isn't simple, you will lose your audience. Things like, no matter how rigorous your evidence, people need to hear stories that underpin the data. Sound obvious? Then why do so few people do it, and why, then, when they hear the Heath's arguments, do they then start doing it?  We have also had Chip come into our classes at the Stanford Institute of Design on creating infectious action.  These are applied classes where MBA and Engineering students are asked tocreate ideas that spread and stick: I have seen them apply the ideas immediately to doing things like spreading the Firefox browser and helping people just out of college start saving money earlier. <br /> <br />As I said, I admit my bias openly, as I know Chip and like him and have talked to Dan on the phone. But at the same time I know and like lots of academics and management experts, but most of their ideas are either hard to apply or aren't based on sound research -- or I can't understand what they are saying. I expect that this book, in addition to the impressive initial bang, will be become a standard text in marketing, organizational behavior, advertising, and a host of other college classes.

B0000057D8|5.0|For me the only lacks in here are just for personal tastes: I find the fifth and sixth concertos a bit boring. On the other hand I've got already six different versions of these Brandenburg and this is which I like the most. The sound is (IMPRESSIVE) crystal clear and is played not only flawless, but with such devotion and passion that I almost fell on my knees the first time I listened to it. <br />I also recomend the version of Reinhard Goebel guiding the Música Antiqua Köln: it's awsome with its fabolous recreation of the baroque sounds. <br />If you like Bach and if you had the I Musici version of these Concertos, throw them away and get this Pinnock's: you won't regret a bit and you will be skyrocketed to Heaven.
B000002IST|4.0|(revised August 15, 2007)    I think Genesis needed the 5-year break. They really came back a lot stronger after that break for this album. It has about twice as many good songs as Invisible Touch! There are actual SOLOS, REAL DRUMS, and lots of other features that make this an album worth buying for any fan. It's not as great as some of their previous works like Duke and A Trick of the Tail, but what have you got to lose for a total of $2.60 used on Amazon? Time for track-by-track:    1. No Son Of Mine - 10/10 - Great song. Driving, and very good lyrics.    2. Jesus, He Knows Me - 6/10- Not as bad as its reputation. Just a silly song. Not the greatest, though. I'm a little tired of it.    3. Driving The Last Spike - 10/10 - Awesome. I love the guitar parts, the drums, the vocals, everything. It's just a very good extended song.    4. I Can't Dance - 5/10 - Silly. The riff's alright, but I've kind of grown tired of this one. On The Shoreline should be in this song's place.    5. Never A Time - 4/10 - Don't like it. Sorta sappy.    6. Dreaming While You Sleep - 10/10 - I hear new things in this one every time. Somewhat reminiscent of the full version of Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, but much more detailed. The vocals and lyrics are equally moving.    7. Tell Me Why - 9/10 - This one has really grown on me since the original review. it's got the nice twangy 12-string, a nice melody, and there's one lyric that I really like here \\"There's too much food but there's none to spare, tell me why.\\" Good point.    8. Living Forever - 10/10!! - That's the ticket. This is the type of song that makes me enjoy their less prog days. Irresistible guitar riff, an instrumental break with a nice keyboard solo... Just a great song for the times and musically.    9. Hold On My Heart - 0/10 - Yucky, sappy, un-Genesis-y.    10. Way of the World - 9/10 - I forgot this one in the original review... Another good, poppy, light song that is just enjoyable to listen to. Gets stuck in my head... \\"Why's there blue sky?... Why's there red sky?...\\"    11. Since I Lost You - 9/10 - This one's another one that really grew on me. If you actually listen to it with an open mind, the music is beautiful and melancholy. The guitar solo is a nice touch.    12. Fading Lights - 10/10 - What Since I Lost You could've been. Great, heartfelt songs with a very nice instrumental break. It's really a great swan song to the \\"Phil Collins Era\\".     OVERALL: If you have an open mind, I'd definitely recommend getting it. It's strong, but don't expect another Lamb Lies Down. That's not what they went for on this album. If you cut off some of the weaker tracks (Jesus He knows Me, I Can't Dance, Never a Time, and Hold On My Heart) you have 54:45 of first-rate Genesis music!
0618680004|2.0|I read \\"The God Delusion\\" with an open mind, with the hope that Dawkins could provide a convincing case for atheism.  Instead what I found in this book were glimpses of insight and some thoughtful reflection on the value of Darwinian evolution and the promise of quantum physics and genetics, but very little in the way of any sort of cogent, persuasive argument for atheism.<br /><br />One gets the sense from reading this book that he is a very intelligent scientist who is very mad at some one-dimensional god that he encountered as a child.  Though brilliant as a scientist, Dawkins clearly has little grasp on the intricacies of philosophy and theological thought and scholarship.<br /><br />He spends less than a chapter giving a cursory, surface look at a few of the more frequently stereotyped and shallow perspectives for God's existence, such as interventionalist theism, deism (divine clockmaker), and of course, secularists favorite target- religious fundamentalism.  He gives a brief mention of Aquinas' Five Proofs of God, but dismisses them without even unpacking them by saying they all \\"involve an infinite regress,\\" (i.e. the answer to the question just raises more questions).<br /><br />He also devotes a few paragraphs to Pascal's Wager, Bayes Theorem, Anselm's ontological argument, and Bertrand Russell's dismissal of it.  About ten pages in total in the book mentioning over 1000 years of philosophical proofs and debate over the existence (or lack thereof) of God.  Much of the rest of the book seems to be devoted to cheap-shot straw-man beatdowns involving negative stereotypes about the worst aspects of religion (which are really merely a reflection of the worst parts of humanity, rather than religion or faith).<br /><br />Dawkins also comes up with some rather extreme and narrowly stereotypical labels for this god that he is apparently so mad at, including:  \\"a psychotic delinquent,\\" \\"hyper-engineer,\\"... \\"a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, meglomaniacal, sadomasichistic, capriciously malevolent bully...\\" and other choice labels.<br /><br />In the midst of this anti-religion diatribe, however, Dawkins allows a few glimpses into his own painful early experiences with religion, as well as a sense of yearning (or at least a sliver of openness) to there being something more to life than just Darwinian evolution and quantum theory.  He recounts a few painful stories of boring sermons and harsh lectures from the strict, almost cruel religious leaders that ran the school he attended as a boy. He also provides a 7-point continuum ranging from \\"strong theist\\" to \\"strong atheist,\\" and rates himself at 6 on the scale of there being a god- \\"very low probability, but short of zero.\\"<br /><br />If one's faith is strong, we should be able to subject it to the most rigorous inquiry, testing and questioning possible.  That is why I read books like that of Dr. Dawkins.  Having read and contemplated his perspective, though I am left knowing more about his extreme resentment toward religion than any sort of logical rationale for atheism.l, filicidal, pestilential, meglomaniacal, sadomasichistic, capriciously malevolent bully...\\" and other choice labels. <br /> <br />In the midst of this anti-religion diatribe, however, Dawkins allows a few glimpses into his own painful early experiences with religion, as well as a sense of yearning (or at least a sliver of openness) to there being something more to life than just Darwinian evolution and quantum theory.

B000002GFC|4.0|I used to think the term \\"remastering\\" was a come on dreamed up by Jimmy Page to sell old Led Zeppelin albums.  I was wrong.  Whoever is in charge of re-releasing the Cream catalogue should be ashamed of themselves.  One of the greatest - I will dare say it - perhaps the greatest rock combo ever - has been ill served by the keepers of the catalogue.  I had a cassette version of Cream's greatest hits that put the sound quality of this CD to shame.  ERIC, JACK, GINGER - intervene and make sure your recordings sound crisp for posterity.  You desreve better than what the corporate masters have dished out.  Anyone with discriminating ears will immediately recognize that the sound quality is a triumph of profit over Cream's artistic genius.  Shameful.  Again (The BBC recordings are horrendous).
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is a fantastic series that earns the accolades in the other reviews.  John Cleese's situation comedy only ran for two seasons for a total of 12 episodes, but it is clear that the Monty Python alumnus crafted these shows with a special care.    The result is a series that gets funnier as it progresses.  Cleese is \\"Basil Fawlty\\" our (anti-)hero, the misanthropic owner/manager of the hotel referred to in the title.  The episodes demonstrate his frentic attempts at either trying to increase the social standing of his establishment, or alternatively, just keep it running.  In these attempts, he confronts many formidable and/or obnoxious characters (the best of which would come down to either his own wife or the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards).  Too cowardly to confront these characters, Basil channels his frustrations to the innocent or harmless...usually his own incompetent bellboy.    What really distinguishes this series is the timing and editing.  There are websites devoted to the structure of these programs and how the plot develops.  Watching any episode, you can feel the tension building as Basil's latest crisis escalates beyond his abilities.  By the tme you get to the final minutes, you are laughing as a release as much as a reaction to the antics.    It's not perfect--some characters never really click (the Major), and its not a very polished production (some lines are inaudible).  All in all though this is one of the few television series worth owning.  An average rating of five-stars over two hundred reviews on Amazon should be a good indication of that.
B000CCD0FS|1.0|The one star is for the technology, not the content or sound.  Boy, did I have problems with this disc (as to a lesser extent I did with the other DualDiscs).  Of the five CD players in my house, this disc worked on only one of them, a newer Sony multidisc player.  It did not play correctly on either my computer cd-roms, including the usually reliable Plextor (only six months old).  Only my work computer allowed me to play and rip the cd correctly.  I then ripped the music to a new cd-r and it plays just fine everywhere.  Keep trying.  It shouldn't be this way, but it is.  The quality of the remastering does make up for the frustration though.
0066620996|3.0|Clearly, Collins' principles are intuitively appealing and very popular. <br /> <br />However, over the last five-plus years since the publication of Good to Great, ten of the eleven companies used to elicit Collins' principles have underperformed their peers/competitors using the same methodology that Collins used to pick them.  Only Kimberly-Clark is ahead. Every other good to great \\"exemplar\\" has fallen behind their competitors stock price -- the measure upon which Collins based his sample. <br /> <br />All the rest either have abandoned Collins' principles, or maybe it all was just a lot of nice thinking that never really existed except in Collins' mind and heart. <br /> <br />Surely, the principles are indeed appealing, but are they really powerful drivers of success in the real world? <br /> <br />And, now that this book has flooded the world, it may be time to reflect on what Lee Scott (Wal-Mart's CEO) has said, \\"You can't do what everyone else does, and expect different results.\\"  Perhaps what you and your organization need more than following the Collins crowd is the realization that to be outstanding, you must stand out.  Competitive advantage is not the result of working through well-known recipes. <br /> <br />Gordon Holbein <br />

1577314808|3.0|First and foremost, I did get a lot out of this book..  Every worthwhile treatise on spirituality and personal development that I have read urges Tolle's basic thesis as a threshold issue; this is to say, in order to obtain any type of inner peace or spiritual satisfaction in life, it is critical to master the mind, and the first step in doing this necessarily involves becoming ever more aware of one's own thoughts and internal dialogue.  However, Tolle does not go beyond this preliminary matter.   <br /> There is much more to personal and spiritual development than learning to witness one's own thoughts and learning to appreciate the present moment.  Tolle's book absolutely will not aid you in defining and achieving goals for yourself, or in developing mastery and power which can be employed in the real world.  Rather, Tolle limits the scope of his book to merely one facet of spiritual growth; present moment awareness.   <br /> Furthermore, if you're like most American's, you suffer from one or more addictions.  \\"The Power of Now\\" absolutely will not aid you in this battle.  I mention this because if you suffer from an addiction, you are very likely searching for answers in books on spirituality, as I myself did for many years.  Ladies and gentlemen, the most effective way to conquer any addiction is through the various 12 step programs such and Alcoholics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Etc-trust me, I'm a charter member of the 3 of them. . . <br /> All in all, Tolle presents his book as encompassing every spiritual concept one need in order to live a joyful, satisfying life.

1582701709|1.0|Rhonda Byrne is a smart woman. Why? Because she is swindling the American populace into buying her garbage. Her information is nothing new. She has simply repackaged that information into a catchy title with a cover that seems to be crying out The Da Vinci Code. Essentially, Ms. Byrne (or her publishers) are savvy marketers. That same information is conveyed more precisely in earlier, original works. Go get yourself Napoleon Hill's \\"Think and Grow Rich\\". You will become a millionaire five times over reading that before you get even a penny from this book. <br /> <br />The truth the American population does not want to hear is that there is NO SECRET! They are all looking for a quick fix. Why do you think fat-loss pills like Hydroxycut are all the rage these days? People simply do not want to do all those crunches to lose their gut. It takes too much time, it's too hard, etc etc etc. <br /> <br />I think one of America's most visible companies has The Secret. It's their motto, and I'm sure all of you recognize it. \\"Just do it\\". Nike has come up with a three-word phrase that is more true and more revealing than any of the nonsense in Ms. Byrne's book. You simply cannot just \\"think\\" about losing weight, \\"think\\" about becoming filthy rich. You must do. And doing something is hard. But hey, that's life.  <br /> <br />Someone once told me, \\"Doing anything worthwhile is going to be hard. If it was easy, it would not be worth your while in the first place.\\" <br /> <br />Please, save yourself some money and save Ms. Byrne from becoming a multi-millionaire. The only one getting rich from her secret is herself. Do not buy this book. <br /> <br />If the book deserved merit, such as the ones written by JK Rowling, all the good for her. But this one is not. It is full of crock. <br /> <br />If any publishers are looking for the next best-selling self-help book, please contact me. I think have a great idea to share! <br />
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|First off, great movie. This review is just to let those who use their X-Box 360 HD-DVD players to watch HD discs that this disc does not read in the system. So, unless you have a standard HD-DVD player, do not waste $30+ to get this to watch on your 360, you'll only get the standard version on the flip side

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Whenever I am feeling blue I put on this glorious DVD and am immediately lifted up. There is not a false moment to be found here. It made me reflect on the spiritual legacy The Beatles left to the world. The real love and spirit that are sorely lacking in our current music and culture. A Light shines in and through George's music, played here by people who knew and loved him. My only quibble is I would have liked to hear Anoushka Shankar and Jeff Lynne play George's other two \\"sitar songs\\", \\"Love You Too\\" and \\"Within You, Without You\\".
B00003CX8V|5.0|I bought this DVD for research purposes.  I will be performing in \\"Promises, Promises\\" the musical based on \\"The Apartment\\".  I am so glad I bought this DVD, as this is a great film.  That's not just my opinion.  \\"The Apartment\\" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won 5, including Best Picture and Best Director in 1960.<br /><br />This film will speak to you on many levels.  On one level, it is an indictment of corporate politics and a condemnation of philandering executives.  On another level, it is an examination of extramarital affairs, and the sometimes dire consequences.  On another level, it is a love story where a damsel in distress literally meets her white knight.  Then again, it is about people who fall into the abyss, only to find redemption and the happiness they deserve.  It is about knowing what is right, and finally finding the courage to do what is right.<br /><br />The cinematography is great, as is the lighting.  The setup is perfect.  We are shown the enormity of a life insurance company, with its 31,000 employees in the Manhattan headquarters.  The shots of the teeming, faceless humanity are fantastic.  The long shots of the endless office are fabulous, and will make you appreciate black and white.  Out of this morass, we are asked to get to know 3 people; C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon), Fran Kubelik (Shirley Maclaine) and J.D. Sheldrake (Fred Macmurray).  They are embroiled in a love triangle that will change all of their lives.<br /><br />The late, great, Jack Lemmon is a wonderful C.C. (Chuck) Baxter.  Lemmon was a dapper 35 years of age when this film was made.  He wants to get ahead, and he does so by selling himself out.  He loans his apartment to senior executives for their extramarital assignations.  They in turn promise to move him up the corporate ladder.  There is humor in this, as Baxter trys to juggle \\"appointments\\" with 4 different execs.  But, as in the rest of this film, there is a pathos to it.<br /><br />Chuck has quite a thing for cute elevator operator Fran, played by a 26 year old Shirley Maclaine.  She returns his innocent flirtations, but for some reason keeps her distance.  Maclaine is all sweetness and vulnerability.  So, why won't she go out with Chuck?<br /><br />As it turns out, Fran has a boyfriend.  That boyfriend is the Director of Personnel, J.D. Sheldrake.  Sheldrake is quite married, and has slept with many women in the office, including his Secretary Peggy Olsen.  Macmurray plays a wonderful cad.  He is not sleazy or oily.  He is able to continue stringing Fran along until one fateful Christmas Eve.<br /><br />I won't continue discussing the plot, as you need to experience it as it unfolds.  While \\"what happens next\\" is not a huge leap of the imagination, the skill of the actors and the sensitive direction make for fascinating viewing.  There are some great scenes in this film.  The pivotal Christmas Eve scene with Sheldrake and Fran will get you at a visceral level.  Macmurray and Maclaine shine here; her with vulnerability and his meeting her vulnerability with incredible insensitivity.  Brilliant.  Lemmon shines in the \\"discovery\\" scene when he figures out that Fran is involved with Sheldrake.  Sheldrake had borrowed the apartment for a rendezvous with Fran, and Fran left her compact behind.  The compact had a broken mirror. Chuck, not knowing who it belonged to, returned it to Sheldrake.  Later, at a Christmas Eve party, Fran loans her mirror to Chuck, who recognizes it.  Lemmon communicated so many emotions with his face, his voice, and his body.  He was such an actor.<br /><br />This movie is listed among the Top 100 movies of all time, and it deserves a place on your shelf.<br /><br />Highly recommended.a thing for cute elevator operator Fran, played by a 26 year old Shirley Maclaine.

B00006RINF|3.0|Everyone seems to think this album is a LC masterpiece and thats it's completely amazing. I definitely don't see it. Every LC album that comes out sounds the same, whether in comparison to their previous CD or when dealing with just a single album's songs themselves. Cristina's voice isn't that great and it doesn't vary whatsoever. The songs just don't give me that \\"Wow\\" feeling at all...this is nothing more than an album to pass the time. Nothing special.
0140067477|5.0|It's just over half an inch thick, and just slightly bigger than pocket sized. If you can fit the entirety, or even a decent beginning of an explanation of the entirety of any philosophy or religion into a volume that sized... without cheating by using rice paper and microscopic print.. well, congratulations, I guess. I'm no scholar.  <br /> <br />It's a surface treatment, and an ok one at that. But most people won't come here for serious expository source material on the intricacies of Eastern mysticism. It's a playful, and simple reminder to most readers that life isn't the overbearingly complicated and ponderous thing that we're all told about. Yes, it involves Taoism. Yes, it involves Pooh. Yes, it bounces around, and it's an easy read. But it makes some valid points worth thinking about, and it'll leave most folks staring off into space for a while when they get done.  <br /> <br />Maybe it's not \\"serious\\" scholarly work. But it's a wonderful departure point for anyone who's a little too caught up in the frenzy of what life is supposed to be... whatever that is. It's hard enough to untangle the mess of the human mind without adding complication to the process by having to pore over a voluminous, verbose, and sometimes vacuous expository volume. Hard enough to figure yourself out as it is, without having to figure out what someone else is saying, too. So have a seat in your favorite chair, relax, unwind, and enjoy.

B00007AJF9|3.0|This movie is beautifully staged and filmed and very well acted. Historically, it is no where near the truth. The problems are... well.... endless, but I will only mention two or three:    1) Elizabeth knows that Robert Dudley is married long before she comes to the throne. The crisis in their relationship comes early in her reign when Dudley's wife dies under mysterious circumstances. Although the death is ruled an accident, many still suspect Dudley (and Elizabeth). This is the main event that effectively prevents them from ever marrying. The fact that almost nobody liked Dudley (except, it seems, Elizabeth) is another.    2) Sir William Cecil is older than Elizabeth but only 12 or so years.  He's not her grandfather's age - as Richard Attenborough looks. Cecil becomes Lord Burghley as a result of Elizabeth's favor, but the movie says she rewards him for his service - as she removes him from office. In reality, she never let him retire from her service, much as he begged as he grew old and infirm.    3) Cat Ashley, Elizabeth's companion and friend, was in fact much older than Elizabeth, not of the same age group as this movie shows. Cat was Elizabeth's governess from a young age, and acted as her mother figure.    Don't get me wrong: this is a great film. Just don't think it's based on reality!
B000002A46|5.0|This continues to be my favorite Christmas CD. Merry Christmas showcases Mariah Carey's true talent. Her version of O Holy Night is often imitated, but never duplicated.

You will be so glad that you added this to your collection, Christmas or not!
0671015206|5.0|My father gave me this book for Christmas 12 years ago, and let's just say that I put it to good use and am glad I did.   My approach has been to buy what I want, wisely.  I also cultivate an attitude of not wanting or needing a whole heck of a lot.  But I don't live like a pauper by any means-- nor do I ever feel the need to buy a new luxury car (I drive a 2002 minivan which was used when I bought it and I'll drive it until a hybrid version comes to the US!).  The onslaught of \\"consumerism\\" messages in our society is mind-boggling.  This book goes a long way to validating the common-sense approach that allows you to steadily build wealth. But don't think it advocates a Depression-era mentality of fear and scarcity.  I think it's more about learning to find joy, satisfaction and happiness in the simple things in your life.  For example, my public library is one of my favorite places!  This is a great book, read it!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|If you need a small flash that is a lot more powerful than the on-camera flash on your compatible Nikon camera, this is a great flash. More than anything, it's a better than on-camera flash that also has bounce capability, which none of the on-camera flashes do. For me, it doesn't replace a full-featured flash like and SB-800 or SB-600, but is a lot smaller and lighter for many times when you don't need the big mama. It's not powerful enough for instance to bounce if the ceiling is higher than 10 or 11 feet with lower ISO settings, where the SB-800 can still reach. I have found I don't use it as often as I thought I would, but that's really because I've not gotten into the habit of using a fill-flash as much as I should. That's not the fault of the flash.  <br /> <br />It is fully automatic, which really means there's nothing to set or control on this unit. If your camera isn't compatible, basically this flash won't work for you. If it is compatible, it works great and seamlessly. I use it with a D200, D70 and CP8400, and it works great with all of them.  <br /> <br />One thing to keep in mind is if you were thinking of using it as a \\"better\\" main flash on for instance a D200 in wireless remote flash mode, think again. Only the actual in-camera flash can be used in the remote commander mode on a D200. And, this unit is NOT capable of being a remote flash in wireless flash, either. So basically, don't consider it as part of wireless remote flash operation. It's a better than in-camera flash, not a wireless flash.  <br /> <br />Also keep in mind as far as I know in the Coolpix line only the 8400 and 8800 are fully compatible with this. Most of the newer DSLRs are, though. If your camera isn't i-TTL, it's not the flash for you. Check the compatibility before you buy.  <br /> <br />If you want a small and fully integrated flash for your Nikon digital, it's a great unit.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I was 8 the first time I first saw this movie....I have never been to a circus ever again. <br /> <br />This movie scared all the living life out of me, but I guess that was because I was a child. <br />But it is truly scary.

0553381407|3.0|I would like to know who is addressing the issue of abusive children. I think that there are soooo many books that thrive on the weak-minded individuals who want someone to blame. Life is tuff and there are crappy kids AND crappy parents. People who read these type of books are probably out of control in many area's of their life and also have a boss who they blame for a lack of success, a minister who failed their spiritual needs, and a dog who refuses to love them. <br />Life is a work in progress and blaming is easy.I met someone yesterday who won't talk to his father for the rest of his life because his Dad did not like his girlfriend who treated the son badly. How did the father know that the girlfriend had a messed-up attitude toward his son? HE listened to what the son told him. The son called the woman his \\" tar-baby\\". But when the Dad said he did not want to associate with the girlfriend, he became his son's enemy. Who is to blame for this situation?   <br />This book cannot fairly give a blanket statement about parents---- people will recognize themselves in this book, just like horoscopes that are a \\"one size fits all\\" concept about how to live your daily life.
1582701709|1.0|This \\"story\\" is the worst thing that someone could have made up.This book is a brainwashing cult. It pretty much is trying to replace the Bible. It leads people to believe that the only thing they need for happiness is materialism. Everyone that I know that has read this book and followed its advice has become very rude, greedy, selfish, conceded, and basicly arrogant that they are superior than people that actually work and earn their living. As an example, my mother started to take its advice and now she is rude, cruel, heartless, greedy, and only cares and thinks about herself(also her friend is like this now).  When before my mother was a kind-hearted sweet person that put everyone first before herself. So save yourself and everyone that you come in contact with so you dont hurt them and yourself. Run away from this garbage.
0977326403|5.0|Everybody involved in the nonprofit world should read this book. I read it without having read Good to Great and still got a lot of practical, useful ideas out of it. It's a quick read, which is good because we are busy people!
B000002KMY|5.0|i've always liked Black Sabbath and as soon as i'd heard Dio's voice from his work on the Holy Diver album, i've loved it. so when i researched Dio a bit more, i found to my surprise that the guy fronted Black Sabbath. but that was years ago, and now i sit here reviewing an album i should have reviewed a long time ago. this album is genious, i'd say it's just as good as Heaven and Hell now that i gave it another good hard listen.<br /><br />Turn Up The Night is a fast catchy track, and a great opener. i like how low and chuggy it starts the album off. Voodoo used to be my favorite off of the album. its mid-tempo riff and awesome lyrics make it a great one. The Sign of the Southern Cross is the epic of the album and is definitely praiseworthy. E5150 is the intro to Mob Rules, and though its just a little experimentation instrumental i like it's little keyboard thing at the end right before it breaks into The Mob Rules. The Mob Rules is the hardest rocker of the album, and begs you to bang your head. what an awesome track! Country Girl is a good one too, with a catchy riff. as much as i love this album, i have to say though, Slipping Away is garbage. Falling Off the Edge of the World is the secret classic on the album, and i'm surprised so many people love this song too. it deserves it, with its giant transitions, it truly is like 2 or 3 songs rolled into 1. i didn't used to like Over and Over, but now that i've given it a good listen, i LOVE it! one of my favorites now, it's slow and emotional and Iommi sounds great throughout.<br /><br />The Mob Rules!<br /><br />and if you don't get this album<br /><br />You're All Fools!
6304884419|5.0|One of the forgotten greats! A lot of people have either not heard of this film or have passed it up? Why?...... Maybe the title sounds dull?....or maybe it just didn't get any buzz going? Whatever the reason, it is a great film and shows another side to the mob and much more. The film is set in the 60's and they really bring you back to that time and my own childhood! Well done! Lillo Brancato's resemblence to Robert DeNiro is amazing and makes it totally believable that he is DeNiro's son in this movie! Too bad! I have heard Brancato has gotten into some pretty bad trouble with the law recently. I would have liked to see him do more than his brief role on the Sopranos. If you love The Godfather,Goodfellas and Casino you should love this too! Not as much violence,but there is alot more going on here than just \\"crackin' heads wit baseball bats\\"! This should not be missed! The DVD is good, but is a bit grainy. This deserves a deluxe makeover!

B000000OF6|5.0|This lengthy two-volume collection does a good job of taking the listener on a tour of Queen's musical chronology, as well as showcasing both the pros and cons present in the music of Great Britain's second most famous rock band of all time, trailing only the Beatles in chart-dominating greatness. <br /> <br />The first volume came out decades before the second one did, and served as a standalone Greatest Hits album until the mid-1990s, when the second collection of hits was compiled. The progression of Queen's style is very evident, especially when you pop out the first CD and put in the second. Personally, I like almost all of the first CD, but can't get into the second one past the first few tracks. The second volume contains much of the later hits in the \\"glam rock\\" style, while the first CD (containing the hits from the '70s, mostly) has a much more classic feel. <br /> <br />Queen's goal always seems to be writing songs that become so classic that they surpass the world of charts and records and become legends. Often, they've succeeded (\\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" \\"Somebody to Love,\\" \\"We Will Rock You\\"). And even when the songs never seem to slip the surly bonds of earth in the way some of them do, they're always catchy and fun to listen to, especially the early classics. My personal favorites were \\"Killer Queen\\" and \\"A Kind of Magic.\\" (As a Christian, I recommend caution with \\"Bicycle Race\\" and \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" due to unwholesome lyrics.) <br /> <br />Unless you're a devoted Queen fan, you're unlikely to really love both CDs, since the style changes so much over the years. However, all of the songs provide a great look at the work of what is unarguably one of the most talented musical groups ever. The collection is a tad pricey for a music album, but if you like Queen, it's worth it.
0060935464|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was a best selling novel soon after its initial publication, won the Pulitzer Prize, and is considered a classic of American literature.  I first read the book as a freshman in high school and fell in love with the story almost immediately.  Harper Lee didn't just create a cast of unforgettable full-rounded characters, including Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, and Boo Bradley that have become a part of a cultural conscious, but she also wove a memorable tale that exposed the evils of racism, as well as other societal ills from child abuse to the flaws of our public education system.<br /><br />The story takes place during the Great Depression in Maycomb, Alabama and is told from the perspective of Jean Louis Finch, aka Scout.  Scout has an older brother named Jem.  Their mother is deceased and they call their father by his first name, Atticus.  He is a lawyer and a respected citizen of the community.  The Finch family undergoes some difficult challenges when Atticus is selected as the defense attorney for a young black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a poor, white woman.  The case rocks the community and becomes somewhat sensational and changes the lives of everyone involved with it.<br /><br />Having reread TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I was once again touched by the beautiful simplicity of the novel.  The characters are authentic and drawn from real life.  The novel is set in the Depression, but the characters could have come from any small town in America.  Having lived and been raised in a small town I notice many similarities between the place of my youth and the town of Maycomb, Alabama as Scout describes it.  That doesn't mean that people raised in an urban setting will be unable to relate to the novel, because they can and often do.  The novel has a universal message and story.  That's why it's a classic and is a book that all Americans should read at least once in their lives.
0767802659|5.0|I loved this movie. This was a mixture of fantasy and science fiction in a very good way. I am a fan of Casper Van Dien and he is cast very well in this role. It was a bonus that we did get to see his bare tush. I did like the special effects of this movie and the sub story that was also included in this movie. I am not going to compare it to the book and I do think it is wrong to compare a movie to the book anyway. Every artist has a different concept of what the \\"scenary and story\\" should be and how it should be presented. I thought that this was a different story to it's genre and for it's time, it did an excellent job at that. I do recommend anyone seeing this movie that is a science fiction fan or wants to see something a little different.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I had missed seeing KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was originally in theatres.  Since its release on DVD I have heard many positive things about the movie and finally was able to view the movie for myself.<br /><br />The movie takes place during the Middle Ages and revolves around a blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom).  Balian's wife committed suicide after the death of their child and he finds himself alone and living in a village where very few of the other villagers like him.  Lord Godfrey (Liam Neeson) returns home to find Balian, his long lost son and ask him to return with him to the Jerusalem, the Kingdom of Heaven.  At first Balian refuses, but after murdering a priest Balian joins his father in hopes that in fighting in Jerusalem he can be given absolution for both his and his wife's sins.  Jerusalem is somewhat unstable.  The King of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) is a leper with no heir to the throne.  Baldwin is a good man and has been able to maintain a peaceful existence with the surrounding Muslim nations.  Baldwin lived longer than anyone expected him to, but each day that passes finds him weaker.  His sister, Sibylla (Eva Green) will inherit the throne after his death and there are several factions fighting amongst themselves for control of the city after Baldwin dies.  Balian enters the scene and wins the trust of some of the nobles, such as Tiberius (Jeremy Irons) and the King himself.  Balian also wins the affections of Sibylla which causes her supposed soon to betrothed Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) to hate Balian more.  Knights Templar under the direction of Guy force a war with the Muslim warrior Saladin (Ghasssan Massoud) after which Balian finds himself forced to be true knight for the people.<br /><br />I know that this version of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN wasn't the version director Ridley Scott had attended.  His version of the film is about an hour longer, but I haven't seen that one yet.  This version of the film is the version that was seen in theatres and as it stands by itself, it isn't too bad of a movie.  The acting is strong through most of the cast.  Orlando Bloom has taken a lot of slack for giving a poor performance, but in reality he doesn't do to bad of a job.  It is true that Bloom is really too much of a pretty boy to be playing Balian (knights weren't always the best looking people around), but the weakness of his character comes not from his performance but from the writing of his character.  The opening scene is supposed to form empathy with the audience, but it doesn't do that.  Therefore, a connection with Bloom's Balian is never really made.<br /><br />The movie has some great action sequences and the cinematography is spectacular.  Great lengths were taken in making detailed weapons and costumes and the siege of Jerusalem is one of the most accurate scenes of siege warfare about an actual real life battle that I have ever seen on screen.  Ridley Scott did a great job of bringing this film together.<br /><br />However, it doesn't work as well as it could have.  Much of this is because Scott's version of the film was cut dramatically.  There are points in the movie where you can tell a scene is missing.  I believe that the other reason the film isn't as powerful as it could be is because of the writing.  Characters that should be written strong, such as Balian, aren't.  Other minor characters come off being more important than they should be while characters that should have a crucial role to play in the film, such as Saladin's sister, aren't on screen more than a few seconds.  KINGDOM OF HEAVEN was William Monahan's first major accredited script so these flaws might just be the learning curve of a major screenwriting.<br /><br />KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is a pretty good historical picture.  It's a decent film to introducing people to the Crusades, but it's also just a fun film to watch on a Saturday night.<br /><br />This DVD version of the script includes a text commentary, some behind the scenes featurettes, a History Channel special entitled \\"History Vs. Hollywood--Kingdom of Heaven\\", and a special that aired on A&E called \\"Movie Real:  Kingdom of Heaven\\".  The History Channel companion piece is the better of the two major special features.  It starts off with Ridley Scott and the major actors talking about the film and then segue ways into examining the Crusades, Crusaders, Medieval castles, and Medieval weapons.  The A&E special is atrocious, though, and is basically a piece of propaganda.  The Movie Real feature is anything but real and includes conversations with the actors of the film as if they are real historians.  Half of the historians in the piece have a severely biased and flawed view of the Crusades and the time in history that THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN takes place and instead of introducing information that the film in someway ignores (such as the fact that Balian had an older brother named Baldwin), these historians perpetuates many of the myths of the film.  For example, none of the historians ever mention that before any of the Crusades started that Christians had been persecuted by Muslims and were no longer allowed to visit the Holy Places in Jerusalem as they had been doing for centuries. There are many more documentaries about the crusades and I would advise watching one of them and just ignore the `A&E Movie Real\\" altogether., some behind the scenes featurettes, a History Channel special entitled \\"History Vs. Hollywood--Kingdom of Heaven\\", and a special that aired on A&E called \\"Movie Real:  Kingdom of Heaven\\".  The History Channel companion piece is the better of the two major special features.  It starts off with Ridley Scott and the major actors talking about the film and then segue ways into examining the Crusades, Crusaders, Medieval castles, and Medieval weapons.

0743289412|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and clearly understood the play on words, the need for repetition, and the ingenious references to SO many current events!!   Mr. King is a genius amongst \\"best selling\\" authors whose \\"best sellers\\" pale in comparison to his WORST books (Lisey's Story undoubtedly being one of his BEST!!!)   <br /> <br />I just wanted to point out that one wouldn't look up the word thoracotomy in the PDR...perhaps Stedman's Medical Dictionary or Merck's Manual!! (Hey, I've learned a bazillion facts from reading Stephen King, SO, the least I can do is point out the ONE fact on earth he may not have known!!) <br /> <br />
0618680004|5.0|Finally, something that needs to be said about the dangers of religious core beliefs, which continue to generate tremendous grief around the world. This is a brave and masterful book. Joseph Dispenza, author of \\"God On Your Own: Finding a Spiritual Path Outside Religion.\\"
0743270754|5.0|wow..I just finished this book..I was a little put-off at first due to the sheer size of this book and the fact that I had read so much about Lincoln and the Civil War in the past year but thankfully I put aside my reservations and read it. Doris Kearns Goodwin has amassed an incredible weaving of 5 different biographies (Lincoln, Chase, Stanton, Bates and Seward)into a story that would beat anything Hollywood could ever come up with. There other books to go to if you want to know all the details about specific Civil War battles but if you want to fully appreciate the great man that Father Abraham was this is the book for you. The political genuis of Abe Lincoln has never been captured quite like this. He truly captured the essence of a leader when choosing a cabinet he chose not men who would tell him what he wanted to hear but the best men for their prospective jobs who would tell him the truth. The way he eventually ended up bringing these powerful, ambitious men to appreciate his talents is remarkable. The way these men came to love our 16th president is awe-inspiring. During the most troubling times of our nation, it is almost like Lincoln was 'hand-picked by God' to lead our nation.
0767805712|5.0|I'm not going to write an in depth review (at least not yet), but I will say that this film was not what I expected, and by that I mean that it was a wonderful surprise.  It's a very intelligent and well made science fiction film.<br /><br />Anyways, if you like full screen hacked up versions of movies, then this DVD is for you.  For everyone else I recommend tracking down the older widescreen DVD release that's out of print (no longer listed on Amazon), or getting the Superbit edition.
0451528956|1.0|In the commencement Mr. Utterson and his cousin Mr. Richard Enfield were walking throughout London. The men go by a mysterious cellar door, and then Mr. Enfield talked about a story that ensue here previously. Also later in the book Utterson work to help Dr. Jekyll from being brung into the ghastly tribulations of Mr. Hydes. One year later, Edward Hyde viciously murders Sir Danvers Carew by thrashing him to death with a cane.  <br />I did not like this book because it was a high level booklover so I could not concentrate. I'd propose this book for high scholar for that reason, and if you're a person who reads allot. The genre was good because it was sci-fi and it seems sci-fi is a little more addicting. The author is a pretty well known writer his name is Robert Louis Stevenson. <br />
0375703861|5.0|One great way to \\"read\\" this fantastic novel is to listen to it on CD. The performance is stunning.  But, either way, this is modern Dickens and carries a giant, sweeping plot hurtling along with tremendous force.  The characters are vivid and wonderful and the variety of ways she attacks race issues and explores racial relations is just beyond belief.  She set the bar high and vaulted over.

B00005JPGO|5.0|TIA in the slang of former South African and Rhodesian soldiers, now working as mercenaries means This Is Africa, a phrase which is used to sum up the brutality of the life that they have chosen.<br /><br />Set in Sierra Leone during the vicious civil war, Blood Diamond sees a fisherman played superbly by Djimon Hounsou, captured by rebels and forced to work as a slave labourer in a diamond mine. Here life is brutish and short. Hounsou, however, finds a priceless pink diamond which he hides and then escapes during an attack on the mine.<br />Leonardo Di Caprio gives a very strong performance, indeed, as Danny, a former Rhodesian soldier now working as a mercenary, and for himself in smuggling diamonds... Danny enounters Hounsou while in the same jail and learns of this pricless diamond that Hounsou has hidden. Eventually persuading a reluctant Hounsou to join him, they head back on a dangerous quest into the jungle to locate this priceless item. Hounsou, however, is less concerned with finding the diamond as opposed to rescuing his son from the rebels. Unfortunately his son has become on of the many 'child soldiers' terrorising the country with the rebels...<br /><br />Di Caprio comes of age in this role and is superb as the cynical Danny and manages a quite convincing Rhodesian accent. Ultimately his journey with Hounsou will change his view on life, as he loses his cynicism and selfishness, and finally begins to understand the awful tragedy which is unfolding around him.<br />Jennifer Connolly plays his love interest, a journalist looking for a story on the source of 'blood diamonds'. Arnold (The Mummy) Vosloo plays Di Caprio's scheming and traitorous commanding officer.<br /><br />As a film, Blood Diamond works very well as an adventure film. It is also an eye opener for those who are unaware of the trade in blood diamonds and the awful price paid in human life to get these diamonds to the shops for the affluent to buy in First World society.<br />A powerful and exciting watch which also imparts a very serious message to the viewer - see it.very serious message to the viewer - see it.
0553801503|3.0|I like soo many other readers plowed through books 1-3 thoroughly enjoying every characters chapter, (eerily reminiscent of wot books 1-5/6) But found that Martin had the wagon wheels of the story spinning in the mud.  Of course I do recommend this book to any fan of the series but keep in mind it feels a little like putting in your (reading) time. With seemingly pointless descriptions of armor and settings a few new characters BUT.. for now I am still keeping the faith that Martin is for examples going to tie the quite island with a certain canine man that is not dead or that the endless Brienne chapters are still going to bear some fruit.  I hope we do not have to sift through that much of Cersei's or Jaime's pov in future books (we really don't need to know everything they are thinking or feeling that is where editing comes in Mr. Jordan could take note).  I did understand a little more in reading the wrap up chapter where Martin writes that this book would have included Dany, Jon, Tyrion, Stannis but it was getting too long and  he wanted to give the full perspective of some of the characters vs. partial from all.  I disagree but that is why he is the best selling author and I am not. In summary I am looking forward to book 5, Martin has set up some very interesting plot developments and set the stage for a lot more death and betrayals and I am looking forward to how he pulls it all together.  I recommend the book but just know it is longer winded than the previous 3 <br />
B00005JPCF|3.0|This movie, I believe, was a good idea.  I think children enjoy the music and dancing.  I do feel like the writers were trying to put too many ideas into the movie which made it seem extra long.  I can see how people are saying that they put politics into it but if that is how they want to get their message across that's their choice.  I don't think children are focusing on that anyway; I think they just enjoy the music and dancing.  My daughter is almost 3 and got bored with the movie after about the first hour.  She liked the music but after the first time you think Mumble will find the humans (the seal attack)she got bored.  I remember sitting in the movie theater thinking to myself, \\"Is this movie ever going to get over.\\"  It just took so long to get to the end, and when it did get over I felt like the producers were like 'ok this movie is almost 2 hours long...we need to end it' so they did.   <br />All in all I think that most people will enjoy it.  I just think it's a little long...but that is the joy of owning a dvd...you can skip the boring parts!
B000HBK3MM|2.0|I bought this CD because everyone was raving about how good it was and how Corinne was so talented. I was truly disappointed. She definitely has a different vocal sound but she sounds like she's just learning how to sing. The music sounds good, however, her voice is soooo very annoying. I'd hate to hear her in concert.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I initially didn't like this film much since I expected an explicit romantic relationship between two gay men, from all the media hype.   <br /> <br />Instead I found a lack of a relationship due to denial, intolerance, fear and responsibility. <br />I think I'm use to seeing more affection between two people in love as well. <br /> <br />I'm afraid I dismissed the whole movie when it's just as creditable and praiseworthy as the Brandon Teena story in the film \\"Boys don't cry\\" without the numerous fatalities. <br /> <br />To my surprise my earlier perhaps abrupt review gave some the impression I was an intolerant extremist with no empathy or understanding for anyone different then myself, when one of the reasons I like film is it offers inclusion into all areas of society. <br /> <br />After many comments, misunderstanding and realization, a kind suggestion was made to view the film for a second time to see what it has to offer instead of what I want the film to be.  Since I would like to enjoy and appreciate every movie and feel privileged to read the heart felt comments I received from many individuals, I have gladly viewed the film again.      <br /> <br />What did I think?  GREAT film...................it's more a drama depicting remnants of a societal forbidden relationship.  There is definitely something for everyone in BBM.  Heath Ledger (as Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack) are at the very least attractive and vulnerable, two of many elements common with falling in love. <br /> <br />Ennis appears to be a quiet reserved hard working realist who wants the type of family he never had and is working toward it.  He seems to be an honorable man who keeps his word and cares about everyone in his life. <br /> <br />Jack seems to be a playful, naive and sometimes reckless dreamer aware of his sexuality and wants to go off in the sunset somewhere and live happily ever after with a male partner during the films era of the 1960's.  He just wants to get on with it, living life to the fullest and the heck with what people may say. <br /> <br />The two men meet in search of employment sheep herding. <br />Jack is clearly interested in Ennis from first sight and shows off a bit in the only boyish way he knows.  The men work together and a close friendship is formed.  Then slowly and unplanned the bond they share is realized. <br /> <br />Intellectually there are layers of emotions and unspoken words that both men are unable to communicate for fear of rejection, persecution, lack of understanding there own feelings, shame, etc.   <br /> <br />Once there work together ends the realization for Ennis that he may have strong feelings for this other man is powerfully, physically debilitating.  He is barely able to keep his quiet exterior and walk away.  Jack on the other hand seems use to unrequited love along with Ennis's earlier comment that \\"this is a one time thing\\", appears to handle the separation casually. <br /> <br />Ennis proceeds with his prior commitment and gets married. <br />Jack meets and then marries it seems in hope that this ethically acceptable relationship will work.  Neither man is evilly plotting to harm there spouses or future children.  They simply want to live and have some kind of life in this world. <br /> <br />A few years later both men realize the passion they initially found hasn't gone away but appears to have become stronger.  The way anyone can feel they are a part of or the soul mate to another.    <br /> <br />Jacks wife seems to be so self absorbed she has no knowledge of her husband's preference until the end.  Apparently there is prejudice associated with the way a man leaves this earth. <br /> <br />Ennis's wife is initially in denial feeling betrayed, then tries to verify her husband's sexuality.  Finally she pulls away from him completely, not understanding, and perhaps feeling shame and possibly disgrace attributed by society's judgments.   She does seem to struggle with loving a man who lovesanother man.    <br /> <br />The complexity and intricacy of each character, the acting of everyone in the film including the depicted societal constrains during that era is outstanding.  The cinematography throughout the film is commendable as well.   <br />And finally, not only did I find love between Jack and Ennis, but Jack and his son, Ennis and his daughters and even Ennis and his wife (although no longer romantic). <br /> <br />I thank those that patiently wanted to understand my point of view in initially not liking the film and feverishly documenting there own views.   <br />Instead of my original review of 3 stars I'd rate this movie with 5 stars *****. <br /> <br />
1400064287|5.0|YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK...VERY NICE..IT WORTH EVERY CENT. <br />
B00003CWTI|5.0|I own this film and love it but it's not for everyone. <br />It's quite unusual, there's a mental break down, regret, hate, remorse, probable past molestation, unrequited love, drugs, death, music, etc.  <br />All of this is presented in a kind of quirky fashion with serious moments and funny moments. <br />I especially like Tom's(Cruise)character.  It is refreshing to see him play a guy with some issues and a pretty crazy profession.  It's laughable but believable.      <br />
B000002U9W|4.0|This album is not what the average Pink Floyd fan would expect to hear. The first piece on this album is what makes it so great, a 23 minute instrumental suite accompanied by an orchestra. Summer '68 is also an excellent track in which one section reminds me alot of the sound of Pink Floyd on their first album: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. The brass section is really kickin' in this track. If you are a huge Pink Floyd fan, or just love beautiful music, this is the album for you!
B0002KVULG|2.0|The 1979 version of DRACULA certainly isn't on many a movie critics' Top Ten list of favorite vampire flicks. The first time I saw it was on cable a few years after the movie's theatrical release. I didn't pay much attention to it; barring a few interesting action scenes, I found it rather boring overall. Then again, that was my attitude toward most movies. I was 14. <br /> <br />Up until recently I've let that early prejudice, coupled with most of the current-day critiques, color my views in regard to this film. But having just recently watched it again, I have to say it's not quite as bad as it's made out to be. It's not the best adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's the worst, either. I must admit there are some truly creepy scenes that save this flick from being total garbage. The way Dracula slinks up the sides of castles, for instance, all the while looking up into the camera with what I can only describe as vacuous eagerness; the way he scratches at the window as fog billows around him, reminiscent of similar scenes in SALEM'S LOT (it's probably that connection which makes it creepy to me); the weird black eyes of the female vampires. Yes, the film has its moments. <br /> <br />The story is based lightly on Bram Stoker's original, taking place in the 1920s instead of the late 19th century. We still have the usual cast of characters, Van Helsing (Lawrence Olivier), Renfield (Tony Haygarth), Seward (Donald Pleasance), and the rest, and they go through the usual movements without much variation; the novelty, I guess, is in the fact that these parts are played by actors like Olivier and Pleasance, two actors I admire. <br /> <br />The film's weak points, I feel, are the romantic scenes, which can get rather mushy unless you like that sort of thing. I've never been much into love scenes, so that's admittedly a personal qualm you may or may not agree with. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, then, we have a passable rendition of Dracula with a few genuinely creepy moments. Suffice it to say it's not a movie I would shell out money to see, but it's okay entertainment to pass some time on late-night TV.
0553801503|2.0|I absolutely LOVED this series. I rapaciously devoured the pages of the first three books and and was consumed by the fever of witnessing greatness as it unfolded. I was on the waiting list for this fourth book, long before its release, and was an avid spokesman for the saga, turning my friends onto the series, mailing the books as gifts.    However my ethusiasm quickly waned after plodding insufferably through   the installment of \\"A Feast For Crows\\".    I kept waiting for something of merit to happen in this book, and aside from one or two incidents, the plot is no further embellished than the previous book. It is missing any reference to half of the most important characters, and the characters that are followed are not developed accordingly.    It is a very stagnant read, and seems, as I read in another review, that the series is now in desperate need of a new editor.     The amazing ability of Martin has been proven in the first three books; but \\"A Feast For Crows\\" does not nearly begin to stand on its own merit. I will certainly continue with the series; but my passion has been severely dampened.
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|Oliver Stone's new film, \\"World Trade Center\\" takes the audience into the lives of two Port Authority police officers who work at the world trade center. Played by actors Nicolas Cage and Micheal Pena, the two officers lives take a dramatic and almost deadly turn when they suddenly become trapped beneath the rubble of Ground Zero. It is during this fateful and defining moment in history that the two men who both have anxious families waiting and praying for a miracle forge an unlikely friendship under the rubble to help each other survive. After seeing the film I agree with some of the other reviews posted online: the storyline is good but in the end there could have been so much more insight into the lives and experiences of some of the other rescue workers particularly the firefighters, paramedics and the hundreds of Search and Rescue K-9 teams who answered the call of duty on that fateful day. The in depth documentaries on this two disc DVD about the real life lives of SGT. Mclaughlin and Officer Jimeno are what makes this DVD a keeper. It's incredible just how reselient the human body is along with the individual will to survive.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I thought the other reviewer's mention of The Killers' sophomore effort, Sam's Town, was appropriate, though for entirely different reasons.  Remember last year when Brandon Flowers was proclaiming himself a rock god and promising the \\"greatest CD of the past three decades\\" or \\"a real album, because no one makes those anymore\\"?  Anyone who heard Sam's Town knows that The Killers missed the mark more than a little bit.  Anyway, when I finally got a copy of Neon Bible, Sam's Town came instantly to mind, because Neon Bible is the CD Sam's Town wanted so very badly to be.  Now, I'm not saying this is the best CD of the past 30 years, but it evokes the 80s Springsteen sound in a manner that doesn't come off as purely derivative, and it builds upon the group's prior work.  The Arcade Fire's sound is at once more evolved and more accessible than it was in Funeral, so this CD will probably introduce them to a wider audience, which is a good thing.  Plus, it is a complete work, with a bunch of great songs (Black Mirror, Keep the Car Running, My Body is a Cage), meshed between other very good tracks.  Neon Bible is an album, the kind that no one makes anymore, and it will doubtlessly go down as one of the best CDs of 2007, and every bit the classic that Funeral was.  It's a very different CD than Funeral, and so comparisons are pointless, but it should offer something to those that already liked the band, as well as those who are searching for great indie rock.
B000003C2U|5.0|Tremendous release by Death and for all intensive purposes - PERFECT. If you don't appreciate this one after a few listens - go back to whatever metal genre you came from.  And stay out.  This is a timeless masterpiece.<br /><br />Whole damn thing is great - I mean every freakin note.. but Secret Face is a fav.
6305754950|5.0|The setting for this western is Texas sometime after the Civil War. There are a number of unique, or at least uncommon, elements in this flick. It begins with a delightful song, \\"El Dorado\\", and the showing of still paintings of Old West scenes. Later, a shootout occurs not only inside and near a saloon, as one might expect in a typical western, but also in a church (belfry and then sanctuary). Women (notably rancher MacDonald's cowgirl daughter) are more prominent in this flick than in most other westerns.<br /><br />There are many violent scenes in the film. Not only are shootings shown, but so also is a vendetta stabbing. Wounded men (including Cole Thornton) are shown in agony.<br /><br />The politically correct won't be happy with the start of this film. Cole Thornton (John Wayne) mentions that, before the arrival of rancher MacDonald in the area, \\"there was nothing here except Indians and coyotes\\". But of course this film was made at a very different time from today (1967).<br /><br />Rancher MacDonald's son, Luke, is sent to guard the ranch. This is, later according to Thornton, \\"A boy doing a man's job.\\" Luke falls asleep and, at the sound of an approaching horseman, wakes up and opens fire wildly. The horseman fires back as a reflex, wounding Luke in the lower abdomen. It turns out that the horseman is none other than Cole Thornton. Luke writhes in agony, explains to Thornton what happened, and then commits suicide with his own gun.<br /><br />Thornton tells father MacDonald what happened, and the latter sadly accepts the truth. But Luke's cowgirl sister does not. She set up a revenge ambush for Thornton, and fires a rifle at him. She says triumphantly: \\"There, you won't be killing any more boys!\\" But it turns out that she only managed to wound Thornton in the lower back. For the rest of the film, Thornton has episodic problems with disabling back pain and arm paralysis from the bullet lodged in his back, which he neglects to have removed promptly.<br /><br />In time, one of MacDonald's remaining three sons is kidnapped, and Cole Thornton works for his release. The local sheriff at first is of no help. He is constantly drunk, and is a laughingstock for everyone around. But in time he gets sober, returns to the saloon, and has a bit of revenge against those who had been laughing at him.<br /><br />At one point, Thornton seems to have an upper hand in a gunfight with MacDonald's kidnappers. But then, at the worse possible moment, Thornton is hit with a spell of back pain and arm paralysis. He is totally helpless! What will the kidnappers do to him? Will he at least get out alive? Will MacDonald's kidnapped survive and ever go free? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.mptly. <br /> <br />In time, one of MacDonald's remaining three sons is kidnapped, and Cole Thornton works for his release.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|Late to the party, I actually first experienced Ray Lamontagne thru this CD. I was immediately thunderstruck. The sound, ie musicians, engineering, etc. is superb. Ray's voice, compared by others with Van Morrison's, actually sometimes reminds me a bit of Joe Cocker (???). This is one of the best new artists I've heard in a decade. As good as Trouble is, I actually prefer Till the Sun Turns Black. I can't imagine anybody NOT liking this CD....a lot! <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The casting was perfect - the main players were all believable, and attractive except for the wicked, wretched phantom of course (Gerard Butler) who was never meant to be attractive in any way. The leading lady, Christine (Emmy Rossum) was gorgeous in an odd but highly appealing sort of way, and her boyfriend Raoul (Patrick Wilson) was adorable. <br /> <br />There was a lot of music, more than we normally like to hear during a film. But it was an opera movie, so what would you expect? The songs were fantastic, easy to understand, and beautifully performed. It could make someone start to like opera if, for some reason, they didn't already. <br /> <br />What I liked best of all in this movie were the sets and costumes. They were unbelievably beautiful. The dresses - oh my goodness - they were incredibly detailed and I would have loved to wear things like that when I was younger. And the old Paris opera house was amazing. In the first scene the opera house was old and abandoned, and the site of an auction in 1919. But then the movie flashed back to 1870 where the main action of the story takes place in the grandeur and luxury of the most wonderfully gorgeous theater you could imagine. This is really worth seeing just to look at the architecture. <br /> <br />So there you have my opinions. If you haven't seen it and don't care for musicals - especially those with lots of opera singing, you still might want to check it out if you like costumes, gracious old buildings, and intense love triangle stories that will stay in your mind for years to come.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Munich is about a group of good people that have to kill the bad people.  11 bad people, in fact.  Each one of these 11 bad people have their own story to tell, and you, the viewer, will get to see their lives and personalities unfold before they die.  They will die by being shot, exploded by bombs, or maybe stabbed.  Pick yourself up off the chair you're sitting on right now and drive to the movie store and rent this movie.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This is a great companion soundtrack CD to MUSIC & LYRICS. The film's greatest asset was Hugh Grant' performance and his voice. That's what sold this film because it was genuine and sincere.  In all Hugh Grant has a pretty good voice which is rather amusing as can be evidenced by this CD. The Haley Bennett songs are good as well and are rather sensually provocative. I like the cover of this CD which captures the spirit of the music and the movie and this CD is a lot of fun to listen as well.
0790729725|3.0|I recommend to buy Goodfellas (Two-Disc Special Edition) directly and skip this cheaper version.  <br /> <br />This movie is a classic, yet Warner Bros does not value its customers at all. Once again, they put up for sale a crappy DVD packaging, only for later release a better version and make you buy it again just because you weren't satisfied with the first one. This version has only one disk which is double sided. That is not the problem, though. The problem is that it stops in the middle of the movie and you have to get up and turn it around because the second half of the movie is on the other side. Kind of reminds me of the old audio-cassettes.  <br /> <br />At any rate, the two-disk version does not experience this and has a lot more extras, you'll be much better off.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Some people would consider this movie a documentary, especially many in Hollywood.  It is more of an editorial than a documentary in that it takes certain facts from a large body of information, and uses it to argue several viewpoints.  These are that the Bush administration did not take seriously warnings about the threat of Al Queda, the Bush administration did not react fast enough or with enough power to destroy the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Bush administration mistakenly went after Saddam Hussein, and had been planning this for a while, and that the Bush administration's ties with the Saudi royal family is biasing them from really going after the threat of Al Queda and those within Saudi Arabia who support it.  Each of these points is argued in other movies, documentary shows, magazine articles and books.  Examples of the latter are referenced occasionally in this movie.  What this movie does is pull many of these sources together, and present them in a cogent manner.  What the movie fails at is to put forward a sense of objectivity.  From the get-go, the audience can clearly tell that Mr. Moore has no liking of G. W. Bush.  The movie makes little attempt to explain the reasoning of the president or his advisers.  Because of this, the arguments of this movie should be taken with a grain of salt. <br /> <br />This movie was released in 2003 after the Iraq War began, and the DVD came out in 2004, probably in hopes of affecting the US national elections.  The election did not turn out as Mr. Moore had hoped, but the failures of the US occupation of Iraq, and the resurgence of the Taliban can only lend credence to the points of this movie.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|This is entertaining, but I was frankly floored that Broccoli would allow this to happen to the Bond series. It's become completely feminized. M is offensive, belligerent and rude towards James the whole flick; Bond is routinely put down for being a man and doing what Bond does best. We all have our favorite presentations in this series, but the old style of witty banter between the boss and him seemed to flow much more smoothly. The most unbelievable part of course is the concept that Bond would quit the agency for a girl. Are you kidding me? The old Bond would bed half a dozen girls, toss them aside and the women in the audience would grin ear to ear.     Craig is a great actor, who would make a fantastic bad guy. Not that it really matters, but even the opening credits with the cool special effects with transparent babes has been replaced by cheezy, low budget stuff. Not to mention the infamous opening scene has been completely watered down; there's no cool car chase, helicoptors, bombs, explosions or special effects. I'm afraid that Mission Impossible has replaced Bond in most every aspect. Oh well, it was a great run.
B00004THAY|5.0|If you love the Blues you have to have this cd. These 2 guys are the best in the business. They do not compete with each other. They simply make beautiful music as a team. With some new albums I have to play them a few times so they can grow on me. Not this time. I fell in love with it the first time I played it. Claptons band is there with them and that just makes it that much better. The only thing I think I could enjoy more is to see them together on stage. Who knows! Stranger things have happened. Buy this cd and buy it now!!  <br />
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Great Tennessee Williams play with many autobiographical ingredients. Fantastic acting from everybody. The story is meant to be about Blanche (Vivian Leigh), but Brando completely captivates the audience; it's hard to get one's eyes away from him. Steamy, sexually charged story, but also with a second side, less passionate, and hidden in the background. This other side of the story is actually the mystery that envelops the main character: Blanche. You will have to find out about her, if you don't fall under the spell of Brando (stanley), and eventually miss the original story.<br /><br />The play develops as a very ambivalent convergence of visions: violent, rude and macho Stanley meets the dreamy and weak Blanche. They play their parts around the pivotal role of Blanche's sister, Stella (who could be also us, the audience). Of course, crude realism, animal instinct love, wins the day over any abstract considerations. But both sides have their ambivalences too. Blanche, as well as Stanley, are not clear cut characters. This convergence of opposites takes place in both of them as well. But that's what lies underneath, if one has interest enough to dig into them.<br /><br />Elia Kazan did a great job creating the muggy and highly heated atmosphere of French Quarter New Orleans. Sets, music, direction... everything is perfect. One great film that feels like being at the theatre.<br /><br />A lot of good extras come in the second dvd: Kazan's career documentary; a short about Brando; and extras about the Broadway show and the movie itself. Great package. Mandatory for any decent film collection.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I know the question has been raised about whether there are extras with the American dvd. Unfortunately, there are no extras. I just received my Jane Eyre and it is two dvds with Part 1 on the first dvd and Part 2 on the second. No extras. Apparently, the British dvd version has extras. I am disappointed because I was looking forward to deleted scenes and, hopefully, a behind-the-scenes look at making this miniseries. This is a wonderful version of Jane Eyre though, so it is still worth buying.
0743298020|5.0|I found this book most satisfying, in every respect. It was beautifully written, full of interesting characters and had enough of the supernatural element in it to be entertaining. Especially appealing was the quirkiness of almost everyone and the literate quality of the writing. Brava, Diane
0786838655|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and my students do as well.  I am reading this one out loud to my seventh graders and they love the way the characters talk like real adolescents, complete with sarcasm and silly comebacks.  The mythological elements are so well done, with the modern twists being unpredicatable and enjoyable.  I could not put this book down, and my kids are eager to hear it each day.  The chapter titles alone make this book ammusing.  How can you not want to know what happens when the chapter is entitled Grover unexpectedly loses his pants, or I become supreme lord of the bathroom?   <br /> <br />Rick Riordan also operates a great web site that includes interviews with him, interactive activities that tie into the series, and an opportunity, if you live in Texas, to go to Half Blood camp.   <br /> <br />I am not a huge fan of Harry Potter.  They take too long to get to the meat of the story.  These books are so much better!  They suck you into the plot and action quickly.  Two thumbs way up for this book and the series!

B0009X7664|5.0|But they did not. So injustice happens. But little children are specially taken care of by God. And those who cause them to stumble had better not been born. Find out who is the children's guardian angel in this story.<br /><br />Along with \\"Night of the Hunter\\" -I can't tell which one is the best of the two- we have two wonderful classics were children's innocence are shown at its purest.<br /><br />Elmer Bernstein's music is just exquisite, and will probably make you run out of tears. One of the top 100 films of all times. Another great film to come out from the South. Plenty of debatable material for history classes, or simply a wonderful film to spend a quiet evening at home.<br /><br />Man's laws are not above God's. Here's a lesson that teaches us to love -and to trust- God more than the law, more than anything. Justice isn't meant for this world. There is another place, where all innocent children go. \\"Let the dead bury the dead, Mr. Finch.\\"<br />(The dvd quality could be much better)
B000002UAU|4.0|Bob Dylan called this disc really over-produced,thinking that it was all very self indulgent - I tend to agree.And though Dylan at the time could crank out classics in a few days,the Beatles took their time and came up with the with the Summer of Loves` greatest album.With nothing but time,experimenting with drugs and having already left the road for good,the band set up shop at Abbey Road studios and first gave us the incredible double a-sided single Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane,then they dropped Sgt. Pepper.By the way,the day after this came out in the summer of 67,with at least two Beatles in the audience,Jimi Hendrix actually opened his London show with the title track.....and he nailed it. <br />Its true that drugs were being used by the band but looking at it today its really a non-issue....never had an artist had the complete freedom that the band experinced at this particular time.A mixed bag that captures many different styles and musical genres making it a little uneven but surely still a great disc. <br />Not every song is a homerun but there are monsters here....if your new to the Beatles there really isn`t a better place to start.A little dated perhaps but still an incredible effort by a band at the height of their powers. <br />As a very young child my favorite song here was always Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,my thinking was it sounded like a haunted circus...imagine my suprise when I learned that John Lennon had gotten the idea for the song from an old carnival poster from the late 1800`s that actually contained the first couple lines of the song.Wow.  <br />
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Not too many spoilers, as any of OMGWTF moments are taken care of pretty quickly, you don't have to worry about this review spoiling the film too much, but if you're still worried about that, read no further, watch the film first. <br /> <br />I bet those who never even heard about an FFVII movie were surprised when they actually saw this on the shelves, and were either exhilarated or skeptical. But that's not the focus of this review! <br /> <br />Two weeks after I got it (the special 2-disc set) for Christmas, I finally watched it. I didn't like it at first, but then again, I was watching it in the middle of the afternoon, and on the English voice track, at that. I watched it again, same night, two hours later, using the Japanese voice track and subtitles, and WOOOOW... <br /> <br />Advent Children is a CGI, Final Fantasy VII-themed, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-caliber martial arts action/drama movie. <br /> <br />I never expected the FF characters to be capable of such martial arts feats, but then again, I'm forgetting their Limit Breaks and backgrounds. Cloud is an Ex-SOLDIER, Tifa is a trained fighter, Barret's a rebel, Red XIII is still partially feral, Yuffie's a ninja, Vincent's an ex-secret agent, and Cid's a rough neck. <br /> <br />There's a good five-or-so real fight scenes. We see them pull some pretty crazy stunts, such as flying or otherwise gliding through the air in some parts, and opponents being hit away, only to skid on the ground or fly through the air for what seems like miles (it looks rather improbable in instances, as some of the hits don't seem that strong, but in other instances, works just right). Then there's all the motorcycle acrobatics, such cyclesaults (somersaulting the motorcycle you're riding), and throwing it at someone with your legs while you were riding it. <br /> <br />There's a good three-four instances in which Cloud should've died right away: 1) Getting shot in the head after an enemy tries a cyclesault (the shot only took of Cloud's goggles and left a scratch), 2 & 3) Being run through with a sword, 4) Being shot in the back. Truly a testament to Cloud's superhuman physique, or the suspense of disbelief employed by most kung-fu movies. <br /> <br />This time around, Cloud has SIX swords, and knows how to wield two at a time! Not only that, but all six of them can connect into one sword, or detach into the separate swords they REALLY are! Best stunt pulled in the movie is definitely when Cloud punks Sephiroth with all six at once. The design of each sword, is of course, awexome, and I think replicas are available on the internet, somewhere. P.S., that weird sling on Cloud's back is actually a set of 4-6 sheathes for each of his interconnecting swords, should he want to be able to pull one out quicker than having to disconnect from the one sword. <br /> <br />The Turks, at least, Rude and Reno, were made out to be far more comedic than originally; at the least, I never saw Rude as being comedic at all. We get to see Cloud slam the door on Reno, we get to see Rude and Reno thrown for miles, and Rude stumble around in a daze after being thrown, only to get punked on the head with a large street sign, and we get to see them fall off the tarp, when trying to climb up it to rescue someone. All those comedic moments, while left me laughing, saying, \\"This is so stupid!\\" or on the other side, \\"Not right now, guys. Cloud's trying to take care of the villains!\\" And let's not forget the fireworks they pull, without blowing themselves up. <br /> <br />After that, the only lame thing there is, is how Kadaj somehow transforms into Sephiroth, katana, clothes, and all. Sure, there was that thing with Jenova's head, but, meh. <br /> <br />Alot of the character cameos were pretty obligatory; they could've told the story with just Cloud, Rufus, the Turks, Tifa, Aeris, and Kadaj/Sephiroth, but you'd probably be asking where the other characters were. Red XIII has only one line during the whole thing,Yuffie has little more than her shouts of \\"Sexist!\\" when Cait Sith tells here to shut up, and, why does Cait Sith have an Irish accent? <br /> <br />All in all, the FFVII atmosphere was still there. The same, dark, grey atmosphere is still there. But they still manage to give it a happy, conclusive ending this time around. <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />Only questions left, is why Kadaj wanted the Geostimga infected children, or how that spring in the church cured them of the Geostigma; what special properties did it have? It could've been Mako, when Cloud was infected by Mako when he fell into the Lifestream.
1582701709|5.0|I am perplexed why there are any negative reviews on this book.  Why?  Because the philosophy is time tested:  the power of positive thinking.  What do you have to lose if you were to incorporate this philosophy into your life.  Wouldn't everyone rather be joyful, happy and abundant?  Well, there is a way to get to that point and it is written in this book, The Secret.  Ignore the message if you will but I believe those who do not ignore it are way better off in their lives.  How can it hurt?  Just the message on counting your blessings is so powerful.  I have included that \\"action\\" in my life and it makes a big difference in how I feel on a daily basis.  It is very uplifting to be reminded of all the good things in your life.  Just putting your feet on the floor is a reason to rejoice and then go from there.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Finally, one of the most sought after films (soon) available on DVD.  Having seen four other versions of the movie, I have longed to see the version I did when I sat agape in a theater in twenty-five years ago.  It took a while, but I am extremely grateful to (soon) be able to watch this again.  On DVD.  Thank you.  :)
0345404475|4.0|We all know that Bladerunner is based loosely on this book. Very loosely. They are two separate works - I like them both, but they need to be considered independently of each other.<br /><br />It's an \\"After the War\\" setting, with the existential emptiness of not really knowing who was fighting, or who launched the weapons that scorched so much of the earth, or maybe even what the weapons were. It hardly matters, since the world is a radioactive waste, with daily reports on fallout the way we expect reports on rain or high tides. The governments want everyone out, to colonies on the other planets. As incentive, they offer a free robot to everyone who leaves, built to request. If you qualify for an exit ticket, there's no down side.<br /><br />Unless you're one of the robots. Slaves, really, since they're carbon goo instead of steel and silicon. Of course, some few try to escape. Of course, since their factory-made minds are so agile, many succeed. Of course, the people (such as they are) who remain on Earth are fussy about \\"skin jobs\\" who killed real people (whatever that means) in order to escape. Enter Decker, a quasi-cop whose job is to bring back enough cells to confirm the kill.<br /><br />Despite it forty-year age, the story remains strong and vivid. Lots of things morphed on their way to the silver screen, including J.R. Well, that's OK. They're different media. They tell stories different ways, and that means that they have different stories to tell. Even with the movie update, this one is still strong and original.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000LC55F2|4.0|this along with the illusionist became one of the great spectacles of 2006-2007.. Featuring a great cast Caine, Jackman, bowie, and bale.. and a great screenplay.. prestige is a nearly seemless look at trickery and deception that leaves you guessing to the end.. a delightful film to watch and one that will make you interested in learning your history too.. this was one of the better films of the year..
B000BLI4PG|4.0|Long ago I had to sell the vinyl version, along with the rest of my collection.  And I always regretted the loss.  The opening theme music stuck in my mind when I saw the movie in its first-run release.  All these years, that music wasn't forgotten.  This cd version surpasses the vinyl.  And the music holds up pretty well, all things considered.
B00013M6NK|5.0|It's original Nikon, so no qualms about swapping it with the battery that came with the camera while that one's recharging.
0790729601|4.0|I found \\"Eraser\\" in a local budget bin & remembered it fondly.  As John Kruger, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the type of hero we like to watch.  Always the good guy, he's not afraid of bashing a few heads, shooting the bad guys or jumping out of a plane without his parachute.  Vanessa Williams, who's now the nemesis on the \\"Ugly Betty\\" TV series, does a good job as computer analyst Lee Cullen trying to do the right thing.  James Caan who got panned for his performance as Agent Robert Deguerin seems like he could be a good guy for the first few scenes.  The late James Cockburn as the agency head Beller flies above in planes and seems to be on the side of the good guys.  Roma Mafia does a nice cameo as the reporter that Lee phones.  Then of course we hear how the reporter was killed.  If you look closely, you can see Camryn Manheim (formerly from TV's \\"The Practice\\" & now on \\"Ghost Whisperer\\") as a nurse.  Charles Russell who had directed Jim Carey in \\"The Mask\\" does a good job of keeping the pacing popping.  We're never far from the next explosion.  Arnold's wrestling match with a crocodile may be the highlight of the film.  This is a high-energy action film that puts your brain in neutral and pleasures you with thrills & spills.  It plays well 10 years after its initial release.  Enjoy!
B000002UAU|5.0|I read the reviews for a basic couple reason;is it a good CD and worth spending what little money I have set aside for CD's? <br />Having said that,this is one CD that is a MUST have for music fans. Previous reviews said all there is to say on the band and music,but let me add this. This ONE CD is the one I see in collections of young and old alike the most, people with such diverse differences in likes of genre and style of music,and that says more that I ever could on my own. When you see this CD in a collection of a 20 year old college student,stuck between Jane's Addiction,Mudvayne,Pantera, and Rob Zombie, you KNOW it has stood the test of time and stands on its own for current musical value. Gives me faith that all kid's today aren't clueless or have bought into corporate blandness completely. <br />OWN this CD.It is timeless. <br />
B00001OH7P|5.0|Yes it has song & dance elements that are not really soulful and fluid but filled with repititious structure and forced.  But it is a great comment on Plastic Rock and the overall theme of self indulgence leading to destruction. The playing, arrangements, drama and so on for this record is super high and it is the one that deserves to get Bowie out of the Gay icon category of always being placed with \\"SIr\\"  Elton next to any and every Rock star- a tactic that is even done at the Planitarium shows of Classic Rock when John and Bowie aren't on the bill- and onto the greatest albums of all time list.  This is not the equvalent of going to the Hard Rock Cafe and the videos are Freddy Mercury with his hairy chest singing Champions and the waiter belting it out at decibel 10 at the same time.  Yes we get that the man was one of the gay entries into Rock music.  Why don't they show the best live performances, and cool clips of movies that have a rock spirit and vintage cool clips in general.  Madonna's boot is not the essence of Hard Rock.  Anyway back to Bowie.  The rest of Bowie like \\"Golden Years\\" is largely duff- albeit \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Changes\\" as well as a few others while flamboyant and poserish are both pretty decent numbers.  They favor structure instead of fluidness but they are well done.  \\"Fame\\" is real annoying to me.  Ziggy however is the one complete work that is a true evergreen.  A must buy for Rock fans and fans of good music in general.
0553381695|5.0|\\"The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I'm not dead either.\\"<br /><br />The Seven Kingdoms is being torn apart by civil unrest. The night watch has dispatched Jon Snow and company north of the wall to attempt to discover the whereabouts of the king-beyond-the-wall Mance Rayder, and attempt to gather some information about \\"the others\\" . Theon Greyjoy, former ward and hostage of the Starks, has returned home to the Iron Islands where his father, Balon, has refused an alliance with Robb Stark, the king of the north,  and instead prepares Theon and his sister, Asha, to lead assaults on differing parts of the kingdom, declaring himself a King. Added to this fray is Stannis Baratheon, the brother of the former King Robert and his younger brother Renly, who both declare themselves Kings of the realm. There is also the House of the Lannisters, who have placed Joffrey on the throne even though his is no trueborn  son and is instead born of a base union of the Lannister twins Cersei and Jaime...and the true Queen of Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen, who is residing in the east with the remains of her Dothraki force and her three newborn dragon hatchlings.<br /><br />The world of Westeros, at large, is in  chaos and upheaval... but the story of the mayhem is a damned good one.<br /><br />Martin skillfully picks up where his first book of The Song of Ice and Fire series left off. In the first book, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" Martin set up a storytelling narrative consisting of 8 main narrators- Ned Stark, Catelyn Stark, Bran Stark, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister. His well crafted story of political intrigue and machination continues in the same vein as its predecessor but adds the narrative stories of Theon Greyjoy, the Prince of the Iron Islands, and Davos Seaworth, a former smuggler turned knight in the service of King Stannis Baratheon. It also loses the narrative line of Ned Stark owing to his beheading by Joffrey Lannister in the first book.<br /><br />Martin manages to keep up the same level of intensity that began in the first book and makes this a sequel worthy of \\"A Game of Thrones\\". Characters are just as riveting and original as in the first... these are not your cookie cutter archetypes but real people of flesh and blood and bone. When the characters hurt, you as the reader feel their pain, when they laugh you found yourself laughing along with them... and when they long you find yourself longing in tandem with them.<br /><br />There were storylines that I felt dropped off in this novel, I will admit, so I can only hope that they become more prominent in the next book. Jon Snow's is the one that leaps to the forefront of my mind, as there is much trekking and fighting off shadow cats in his storyline and not much else that happened. Daenerys was also not in this book to the extent of the first novel, but Martin has set her on a path that I feel will only increase her presence in the next book. The addition of many new characters makes my need to read the next book imperative though. I delighted in the addition of Jaqen H'ghar, who is a member of an elite assassins' sect from the Free City of Braavos found in the Arya plotline. The addition of Jojen and Meera Reed from Greywater Watch in the Neck was a nice touch as well. Also the new narrative of Davos introduces the character of Lady Melisandre of Asshai, a red priestess skilled in the black arts and in service of Stannis Baratheon. Brienne of Tarth, from the Catelyn plotline, proves to be an interesting character to follow as well.<br /><br />Overall, I can confidently say that I am hooked on this series, and that I plan on reading the next of the series. Where it will do I can not say, as Martin is so deft at plot twists and throwing things into themix that I never would have expected. This is truly one of the best fantasy series of our generation, and I can't wait to pick up the next book.hrowing things into the mix that I never would have expected. This is truly one of the best fantasy series of our generation, and I can't wait to pick up the next book.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|3.0|This film succeeds in some ways. Its characters were well drawn, you cared about them and the movie exalts interfamily cohesiveness and caring, which is clearly the main point of the film. However, the movie, upon later reflection, seems also to show - and essentially condone - a number of what I would call immoral & irresponsible behaviors: using illegal drugs (in old age at least), corrupting the morals of minors, encouraging lewd dancing of children, reckless driving and other law breaking, and destruction of private property - most of it just to get their prepubescent and overweight little girl to a beauty contest. One can argue that this movie is, in fact, corrupt and immoral precisely because it camouflages a lot of illicit behavior under a lot of sentimental interfamily caring. Not that all film action by good characters has always got to be good and decent, but evidently, long gone are the days when Hollywood is able to display the same important meme of family caring without the hip baggage of illicit and irresponsible behavior - its just too easy with it to make humorous scenes. I give it only three stars.
B000002KKS|4.0|Most Black Sabbath fans were sure,so VERY sure, Sabbath was over with Ozzy gone,including myself,but this album proved everyone wrong! While very talented Ozzy had become King of the double-tracked,effects laden vocals,Ronnie is just brute-force,giant voiced Lord of Metal on this CD. Don't try to compare,just listen. I have to admit a bit of history here...I saw the 1980 Heaven and Hell Tour in Lubbock,Texas on my 18th birthday. Bought my first legal beer there! Folks, it was a show full of old Sabbath fans with arms folded across their chests, exuding show-me attitude,and it was gearing up to get ugly. You could taste the tension... <br />Then...BOOM! Out comes Sabbath with this very small dude named Ronnie James Dio on vocals, and history was made in Buddy Holly's home town! It was phenomenal. That sums up the essence of this CD;it's heavy metal history on disc. <br />Buy this CD!!!
B000050HTO|5.0|Glad I bought this. I'm trying to replace the old vinyl albums I once had and this is a good start to my new collection of Dylan CDs. It satisfies the immediate need until I can afford all of the replacements.
1582701709|1.0|...Beggers Would Ride\\".. there is nothing wrong with positive thinking, however if I want a mountain to move, I had better pick up a shovel regardless if I whistle while I work..  <br /> <br /> If we want success, quality of life, security and happiness, we may want to consider Thomas Jefferson's writings and implement some of his thoughts into our daily lives.  We would have much better outcomes.
0714844659|5.0|What a charming and wonderful book this is!  From the lemon, rice and polenta cake to the Pistachio cake using a bit of wheat flour and ground almonds and pistachios, to the Eccles Cakes (cookies that use pie dough as cases) filled with raisins, spices, lemon zest and brown sugar to the lamb shank with cumin, eggplant and chickpeas, it's all wonderful.  I've tried several other recipes, and, although I've only had this book for a few months, it's covered with smudges and bent pages.   <br /> <br />I love this book!
0739326740|5.0|Sad to say it, but this is the first book Ive read since highschool.  Now, many might say thats why I gave it five stars, but I would have to disagree.  This book had me from the first page and in my opinion there was never a dull moment.  Another one of his books that might just be a little better (and I say might) is Angels & Demons.  Also Deception point was really good.  Hope my opinion was helpful.  I didnt want to get all into details, and historical  information cause it is a fictional story, but it will make you question a lot of what you may have brought up to believe.
B000I5X81A|1.0|Don't expect the usual Clapton--this is definitely a departure from past endeavors but still worth the purchase. One needs to play this CD a few times and get familiar with the new tunes--some are great and a few are average. Overall, this was a worthwhile purchase.
B00005JNS0|5.0|What can I say? When I saw previews I thought they would not pull this one off! Was I wrong. My kids love it. Clever characters, great voice talent. The animation is a step up, look at the relections and shadows-very realistic! Just a great all round film to put on the shelf with Toy Story, Bugs Life, etc..
B00006CXXU|4.0|You gotta admit that this is not the same Genie In a Bottle girl showing up on this album. This is a very mature album and glad that Christina took charge of her direction in music. It definitely paid off and anyone who listens to it won't be disappointed.
0385751060|1.0|I have read several other reviews concerning this book wherein the<br /><br />reviewer states they think this book is great for children and adults.<br /><br />I totally disagree. Children under the age of 17 should not read this<br /><br />book.  The final chapter leading up to the ending is much to graphic for<br /><br />a sensitive child to read. Even as an adult in my 60's, I find this book<br /><br />troubling. (I also would not donate it to my local public library.)
0060832819|5.0|Paulo Coelho in my opinion is the best writer I have read in my life.  He astonishes me with his natural talent and his insight.<br /><br />The following quote in this book sums up all of his writing that I have read.<br /><br />\\"Everything thats written in my books is part of my soul, part of the lessons Ive learned throughout my life, and which I try to apply to myself. I am a reader of my own book.\\"  (This is what makes his books phenomenal.  I attempt write this way in my books.)<br /><br />The Zahir invites the reader on a man's quest to find his missing wife.  This quest is a mysterious journey of self exploration and meaning in life.  Along the way the author brilliantly integrates Universal principles of life and profound insights into successful and meaningful living.  Enter the world of the Zahir and allow yourself to experience the adventure and wisdom that lies in these pages.  Its brilliant, creative, thought provoking and a must-read for the seeker of Truth.<br /><br />Some key insights and lessons contained in this book are:<br /><br />Live in the moment<br /><br />Love is the Energy of the All-Powerful Universe<br /><br />Follow the signs placed in front of you by the Universe<br /><br />Everything in life has a specific meaning<br /><br />Live unique and creatively- Do not just do things because people say so.<br /><br />Embrace the precious gifts in your life.<br /><br />Follow your dreams.<br /><br />Go beyond what you believe your limits are.<br /><br />Dare to take risks and welcome change in your life.<br /><br />Don't believe the story society tells you.<br /><br />Stop being who you were and become what you are.<br /><br />The Zahir is highly recommended and I suggest you read and live his books.<br /><br />I wish you great success on your precious journey of life.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend really changed the R&B game when he dropped his Grammy winning debut album. \\"Ordinary People\\" was amazing and he could definitely perform well live. That lacks a lot in the industry but he's the truth. Other tracks that are good are \\"I Can Change\\", \\"Lets get Lifted\\", So High, \\"Used To Love U\\", and \\"Don't Have to Know\\". This one is better than his new album so pick this up.
B000NA28IE|2.0|I really had high hopes for Eragon back in December.  It's one of my favorite books (Very good, read it).  But, much to my dismay, Eragon left a bad taste in my mouth.  I mean, it wasn't unwatchable-I could sit through it again-but too many things weren't served justice (Ask any book fan, having the dragon grow within a few seconds-as apposed to a chapter or two in the book-was really disappointing).  If you must, rent it, but please take my word for it: this movie does not belong in your collection.
068987474X|5.0|This is a great book and gives it very straight forward. ALthough i know there are many mized reviews on this but it overall is a wake up call much needed to gurls hung up on those hopefuls. The meaning of the book is insightful but also presents the obvious. <br />
B000K4WLXA|5.0|It was about 9 years ago when Final Fantasy 7 came out, and it is still the best game I have ever played. It was also one of the first games I have ever played so that could be a good reason why. Needless to say I was excited when I heard about this movie, I couldn't wait to see those great characters again. I have to say I was not disappointed but felt rather giddy, like I did 9 years ago as a little kid, when I saw Cloud and Sephiroth together again. Anyone who played through and enjoyed the game will enjoy this movie as well. It continues the story consistent with the attitude of the characters in the game and leaves nothing unexplained in the end. It was the conclusion I have been waiting for all these years ever since I finished the game and desperately wished there could be more.
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|I really liked this movie with the doc. I felt I was taken through the film makers thought process and the commentary really goes into depth. A disturbing film. Good reasons to get the special edition.
1401302378|1.0|I just finished listening to a podcast of the author being interviewed about this book on KCRW in August 2006. I expect that in 5 years we'll be looking back and wondering, \\"What were we thinking?\\" This has all the hallmarks of an idea that seems profound now, but that the future will not treat kindly. <br /> <br />The author is an editor of Wired magazine. This explains the expectation that the internet and digital media will change everything. It's like reading about the importance of makeup in Vogue. That we're discussing the book on the internet explains why most the reviews are favorable. <br /> <br />The author says \\"The Long Tail\\" is \\"...life after the blockbuster. It's what happens to our culture and to our economy as we shift from mass markets to millions of niche markets.\\" <br /> <br />I can't agree. What I see is the consolidation of markets and the homogenization of local cultures. While the number of products we have access to may be increasing, the number of places where we can purchase those products is not. Amazon may carry more books and iTunes more music than local stores, but each is still just one entity. What happens when we want a choice of where we buy and not just what?
B000M5AJQS|1.0|It must be just me because I really cant give this movie more than that and less if it was possible. My daughter said to me the other day \\"You really must see The Departed.\\" What would you think if someone said that to you? Wouldnt you think she was saying it is a great movie???? Wrong! What she was saying is that it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, and that includes the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!!! What a complete and utter waste of time! I cannot fathom what on earth the producer, director cast and crew thought they were doing!  Rooting for good and expecting the bad guys to get theirs is a human pass time isnt it?  The craziest ending ever on a par with Alington Road that makes excellent acting pale into nothing. From the beginning of a very predictable movie the writers obviously realised this and made the ending so dumb as to make the complete movie a waste of precious viewing time.
B000002G87|5.0|Remember vinyl?  Back when records were put out on vinyl I used to say that vinyl had never been put to better use than making this album.  It is the greatest album ever made by anyone at any time. I'm not even a big Clapton fan, I don't care about \\"Guitar Gods\\" or endless solos or any of that crap.  Every song here is heartfelt, anguished and played by musicians who sound like they're on the ledge and could fall at any second.  But they don't fall, they hang together and no one ever played better. <br /> <br />Everything builds to the end of the title cut where Clapton invokes Robert Johnson, \\"Please don't say we'll never find a way, And tell me all my love's in vain.\\"  Then the piano coda, and the quietly resigned \\"Thorn Tree.\\"  Perfect, never matched, never surpassed.

Now i can watch friends when ever i want and i would recomend this item to anyone. The episode booklet guide has the most amazing pictures.....just a great way to get all the ten seasons.
0553804677|5.0|For some reason I had a bit of a slow start getting into this book, but once I did I just loved it. I can't wait for the next one to come out in the summer so I can see what Locke Lamora will do next (although this one can certainly be read on it's own, if you're not a series kind of reader). Thank you Scott Lynch! I'll be recommending this others.
1582701709|5.0|I initially did not pay to get this (The Secret/Law of Attraction), I used free sources of The Secret material in order to learn about it, and only afterward am I buying copies for my home library.  So I was able to stand in the position of either gaining something from the experience, or not, but without having to be right or wrong about having been ripped off or blessed by the author's effort.  I think that's an important distinction to make because we're often in a mode of thinking that says there *must* be a right & wrong (instead The Secret urges you to approach everything from a perspective of genuine gratitude, which alone transforms your thinking if you allow it to).  I've read others reviews of this book and, if you're on the fence about reading the book or watching the DVD, then I want you to know this book absolutely helped me transform my life.   <br /> <br />I've read the reviews where people talk about being in grief, I was grieving when I read this book and had been (and in victim mode) for two years (living in a near fetal position), and this book unlocked my thinking so I could choose a better way for myself.  If someone believes this book has a 'blame the victim' tone or 'you attracted your own illness', that's their own negative thinking believing that, because nothing in this book or DVD blames someone who's been victimized or has been ill.  If that's the message you get from it, re-read it, and challenge your own thinking!  If they can't let go of their negative thinking don't let that affect your view of material that truly has the potential to be transformative.  For me, it was transformative, it was like the first sunlight I'd felt in several years and I'm SO grateful for it.  I've used the techniques to transform my relationships (with family, friends, pets and even 'difficult' people I thought I might have to excise from my life), home, career, my everyday outlook, my abusive childhood and past relationships, and more, every aspect of my life has been positively affected because I changed how I look at it and how I interact with people.  It truly freed me. <br /> <br />For me, I recommend it as a must read.  Yes, other authors have written on the same topic, but I've read many of those and the message has never been as succinct as it is in this writing (I recommend both the book and the DVD).  Since Oprah featured it, libraries everywhere have the book, but at some point you'll want to come back to Amazon for a copy for your own library (and even copies for family and friends). <br /> <br />So read it? Absolutely, and make up your own mind!
0743298020|5.0|At times some of this book moves slowly, ie the storyline with the parents, but the rest of the book was hard to put down. Diane Setterfield does a great job weaving the tale with some great surprises along the way. A definate good time.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Stunning album.  I don't know how they kept secret their collaboration, reportedly constructed from hours and days in the studio over the years, but this collection is remarkable.  The two performers roam across formats, genres, and sensibilities. They've got lyrics, blues, ballads--pretty near everything out there. Whoever wrote the (...) 'editorial review' could not have been listening to the same thing that I did.     I'm profoundly grateful that these two artists came together for this simple and profoundly moving collection.
1582701709|5.0|The wording in this book at times comes across as \\"new-agey\\", but the message is solid. This book cannot be read in a few days, as there is a lot to take in. That said, I would say this book is not one to lend out because you'll never get it back. I have been buying extra copies of this book to pass along to family and friends...Three weeks after reading this, I still think about it everyday and put The Law of Attraction into practice. <br />This book has changed the way I think and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.
B0000017CA|5.0|Ever so now and then, a band comes along that really shakes things up and changes the way we listen to music. The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Metallica, and... Acid Bath?<br /><br />OK, so not everyone has heard of these guys. Except for those of us in the faithful underground. Unfortunately, (or not!) some \\"would-be legendary\\" bands never achieve fame. Acid Bath is one of these bands.<br /><br />This music is not for everyone. From the front cover featuring a painting by convicted serial murderer John Wayne Gacy to the chilling pulsing rythyms and dark poetry of \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\", this album does NOT pull any punches. It is dark, brooding, evil, poetic, raw, haunting and beautiful. Frontman Dax Riggs croons and screams from the deepest corners of his soul while Sammy Duet provides the torturous demonic wails that rip through many of the tracks.  Every song on here is excellent, but the standouts aside from the aforementioned track are \\"Dr. Suess is Dead\\", the classic \\"Fingerpaintings of the Insane\\", \\"Jezebel\\", \\"Morticians Flame\\", \\"What Color is Death\\" and \\"Bones of Baby Dolls\\".  If you have not heard this band and you are a fan of metal who can handle some dark subjects, you owe it to yourself to buy this album immediately. It is unfortunate that these guys only put out two studio albums in their short career, but they are both musical opuses.

B000784WMW|4.0|There has been some dispute over the length of time this film spends on Jane's childhood. I however found it to be an appropriate length because the book does spend at least 100 pages in it, so granted it should be 1/5 of the movie since it is 1/5 of the book. They did a very nice job capturing it, especially since it is so important in who Jane becomes. However I did think they should show the closer attachment to Jane and her friend at school and show her dying, since that is what made me cry when I read the book. <br />I loved the movie and thought it was so great. The last hour is probably not my most favorite but I love building up in the movie and waiting over 3 hours until they finally kiss. It is after all my favorite book :)
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Although fitting a mainstream audience, 'Karol: A Man Who Became Pope,' has to be one of the greatest movies in Catholic cinema.  Taking the life of Pope John Paul II (featuring Polish actor Piotr Adamczyk) from the Nazi invasion of Poland to his rise to the papacy, 'Karol...' clocks in at 3:06 without a wasted scene.  The acting is decent to solid, and there are enough threads throughout to create a seamless presentation.  Relationships are focused upon clearly while the story weaves its way through the ordeal and horror of Nazi occupation to the decades of communism until the man who said, \\"Evil will devour itself,\\" becomes that self-fulfilling prophecy.   <br /> <br />Familiar to most people, not just Catholics, the story is a study in resiliency, a witness to a spirit that isn't broken--even in the direst of circumstances.  The highlights include his relationships with Jewish friends, his underground actor days, his eventual embrace of priesthood, and his scholarly and ecclesial roles as they develop.  At the forefront are history defining moments that swirl around the main protagonist.  Always authentic, never dull, and stirring without a shred of sentimentality, 'Karol:  A Man Who Became Pope' is a master portrait of a man and his flock over time.
074356619X|1.0|If the use of the law of attraction was this effective then every professor that taught quantum physics would be driving an expensive Italian sports car to the campus as proof.  Your time would be better spent reading a good book that focuses you in a positive realistic direction like \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\".  This is by far the worst book I have bought in years.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Contrary to what at least one reviewer has said, Al Gore does NOT pose as a scientist in this documentary -- he is doing nothing more than speak as a concerned citizen who has looked into the data and wants to share what he has found.  None of the research is presented as his own.<br /><br />The problem is that the issue of the environment has become too politicized for anyone to listen to the actual evidence without letting their blood boil in a red state-blue state spitting contest that will get us no where fast.  But as Gore points out in this superlative documentary, the environment is not a Republican issue, and it isn't a Democratic issue either.  It's a moral imperative that every world citizen needs to acknowledge for the sake of our collective future.  I implore you, take personal politics out of it and at least listen to what he is saying!  As a sidenote, I found it very interesting to see how disillusioned Gore seems to have become with politics after years of trying (and failing) to get the environment into the American consciousness in congress and as the head of the senate.  He has come to the realization that politicians only act on policies that their voters demand them to take action on, and so he now looks to bring the environmental crisis to the attention of the American people.<br /><br />At the very least, I don't know how anyone can argue with the time lapse photos of glaciers receding, rivers drying up, ice shelfs melting, and entire lakes disappearing over a mere forty-year period.  It gives you the chills to SEE the climate changing over such a short period of time, and I'm befuddled that anyone could call such drastic changes \\"cyclical events\\" that are of no concern.  Look at the Alps in 1930 and compare them to a modern photo, then just try to tell me that there isn't something horribly wrong here.<br /><br />Gore presents the evidence in a reasonable, logical, extremely rational argument that hits home because it is so earnest and heartfelt beyond its scientific core.  And it isn't all doom and gloom -- Gore comes across as an optimist who really believes that we can make the necessary changes if we really make an effort.  Humanity has, after all, effected great changes in its history, and in the long run they have proved their worth -- the civil rights movement being one of the more recent examples.  Gore also shows how \\"going green\\" will not hurt our economy as naysayers would have you believe, but would expand it to new heights.  For example, right now American cars cannot be sold in countries like China that have enacted stricter environmental policies, so if American auto manufacturers get on the ball they can re-open international markets that have been closed to them due to our own stubbornness and short-sightedness.<br /><br />Technology has grown so fast, perhaps evolving so quickly that now we humans need to catch up to it.  Change is difficult to accept, as Gore readily acknowledges, but can open up a wealth of new possibilities and opportunities as it makes the world a better place for us and for future generations.  And the time for action is now -- before it is too late.  It's about time we learned to face the inconvenient truth.heartfelt beyond its scientific core.

B000KX0IOK|2.0|This could have been a satisfying film, but the writing (and maybe directing) prevents it from being so.  Too many scenes in the film do not support the ideas about the characters that the writers were trying to develop.  The main character Dan Dunn, a middle school history teacher, is not the inspiring, cutting edge teacher that the writers hoped to portray.  If the writers think that his history lessons  (don't memorize dates, but think about the big idea) are cutting edge, then they haven't been in a history classroom in about 15 yrs--that's standard procedure in history curricula today. As for his coaching style,  one can tell that the writers weren't \\"jocks\\" in their schooling.   Also, Dan (excellent portrayl by Gosling) is not a good guy at all.  He is very typical of a drug addict-manipulative, selfish, amoral, and downright unlikeable.  Oh yes, he does want to tell the drug dealer to stay away from Dre, his student-friend,  for all of two minutes in the film before he decides to have a drink and some \\"candy\\" offered by the dealer.  Come on, who can care about this character?
0895260131|1.0|This book is pure rubbish.  It generalizes and stereotypes Muslims based on the extreme minority of Muslim extremists.  Unfortunately, the author is as much of a hate mongerer as the very people he ends up condemning.
B000M341QE|1.0|I would like to say that even though I had heard that this was a really violent movie with filthy language, I went to watch this movie with positive expectations. I mean, isn't this the director of Goodfellas? I thought this movie would be rough around the edges with a great story, as most of Scorcese's films are. I was BRUTALLY disappointed. I cannot believe how bad this film was. In most films that use foul language, the the foul language is a part of the dialogue which kind of makes a background tapestry that makes  up the film. Not this movie. The language was so bad that it totally detracted from the viewing experience. It would have been a much better film without the disgusting language. And that's not the worst quality of the movie. The plot was generally well handled, and often suspenseful,but was totally predictable. But there was one problem. I didn't care what happened to the characters. And the plot \\"resolution\\" which I won't give away here was so disappointing, so bad, so WRONG and DISAPPOINTING. At the end of the movie the only thing I could think was WHAT A HORRIBLE FILM AND WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME. DiCaprio's performance was great, but it didn't redeem this film. Why does hollywood continue to churn out such drivel? This film, so far as I can tell has no redeeming qualities. I long for movies that are actually entertaining, and this film is not among those. Shame on you Martin!! I  recommend this film to masochists only. If you want to know what this movie is like, punch yourself repeatedly in the face and you'll know.
0743289684|5.0|Contrary to the pabulum that Islamic experts tell you every time a Muslim blows themselves up, ploughs themselves into a building or beheads an infidel the truth is darker.  Thankfully Ayaan Hirsi Ali exposes the truth and the danger it poses to western values.  Those very values that tolerate all beliefs even those whose very desire is to take the world back to the 700's.  In Holland the authorities were actively working on behalf of the Jihadists in seeking to expel her due to immigration irregularities.  Sadly I doubt this book will awaken sleepy Europeans until their beloved values are deemed illegal by a Saharia court. <br /> <br />I am honestly worried that she will probably meet with an untimely end.  Wherever she travels she has a bodyguard.  I wonder if she already cannot travel to Europe due to her \\"intolerance\\" of Islam or just for her safety.  Sad but true, and it isn't getting better <br />

B00005JPAM|5.0|<br />Perspective changes with time. Now I can empathsize the Queen. To issue an immediate statement after Princess Diana's death would be irresponsible, an act more suited for a populist cum politician. To be able to stick to her principles (even as it may be out-dated), reflect upon the escalating crisis and do the only thing (not necessarliy the right thing) left to do for the monarchy makes Queen Elizabeth II a truly outstanding soverign. Such is the wonderful script which makes the movie  thought-provoking, warm and intriguing. <br /> <br />Helen Mirren is brilliant in her portrayal of the Queen. I especially like her subtlety, her \\"stubborness\\" without offending anyone. Instead, she has my complete sympathy. The movie is shot in such a beautiful countryside and full of metaphor. The Queen love the dogs, the deer and may very well be more at ease displaying her emotions toward the animals than towards people. The dialogues may be far from what actually happened but the Queen's personality is wonderfully portrayed. <br /> <br />This is really a film that has done justice to the royal family and provides a refreshing angle towards the historical event of Princess Diana's death. Don't miss it.

I am glad that their are so many people that do like it though. They are an amazingly talented band and deserve to be encuraged. I just hope that one day in the future they release some thing a little more toned down.

0618680004|5.0|As an atheist, I am often shocked at how the irrational beliefs of others are not only tolerated in the US, but uplifted to a place where if one questions those beliefs, one is being mean or hitting below the belt, even when no malice is intended. Thank goodness for the straight-talking Dawkins.<br /><br />He breaks down the logical fallacies in many aspects of religious beliefs, and shows us how logic really does not lead one to believe in a god or set of gods. There are many reasons to have religious belief, but logical and methodical thought does not lead a person there.<br /><br />I have read many books on Christianity and given it a chance to show me that it is the absolute truth, and have remained decidedly unconvinced despite a desire to believe in a benevolent creator who loves me personally. I only hope that Christians will give Dawkins the same chance that I gave their books. If Christianity is true, which I don't believe it is, then surely it will stand up to a logical assessment?
B00005JPDS|5.0|I went to see this movie on my birthday, and I tell you, the ending made me cry; The sheer energy of Will Smith just going out there to the games with the President on just nerve, and then going to work and possibly not being able to have a job at the end of that internship was just nothing but inspirational.Then when they are homeless and on just raw imagination, Will Smith tells his son that they are living in the dinosaur age, That was pure genius.I felt so bad when he lost his toy while they were trying to catch the bus. I won't lie but I cried at the end; I was really rooting for him big time. the son was darn good; he was truly good and I am sorry that Will didn't win the award though this year the award for Best Actor was pretty challenging; Nevertheless, the film is worth the price of admission and more and good for those times when you feel your on your last leg.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Director John Ford has done a masterful job of bringing John Steinbeck's timeless novel to life in this movie.  Starring Henry Fonda, Ford's film brings the struggle of the 1930s migrant working family to life. <br /> <br />Fonda stars as Tom Joad, a young man who's just been paroled from prision after serving four years for manslaughter.  Upon arriving home, he meets Casey (John Carradine), a former preacher turned drifter.  The two then head for the Joad homestead.  Once there, Tom discovers that his family is gone.  However, Muley Graves (John Qualen) has been hiding out in the Joad home.  After he is discovered by Tom, Muley tells of the numerous land corporations and banks who have been taking possession of the local farms.  Tom's father's farm has been repossessed, and the family has went to Uncle John's (Frank Darien) home.   <br /> <br />Tom and Casey head to uncle John's house, where they find the rest of the family, including Pa (Russell Simpson), Ma (Jane Darwell), Rose-of-Sharon (Dorris Bowden), her husband Connie Rivers (Eddie Quillan), and Grandma and Grandpa Joad.  The government agent comes to inform John that his land is being taken over, and the family packs their truck and begins the journey to California. <br /> <br />Along the way, the family is faced with many different trials and tribulations, including the deaths of grandma and grandpa Joad as well as Connie deciding to leave.  They are forced to live in campgrounds designed specifically for refugee migrant workers, while Pa, Tom, and Uncle John try to find work. <br /> <br />Eventually, the men find jobs as fruit pickers, but they barely make enough money to buy food.  There are run-ins with townspeople who don't want \\"Okies\\" stealing any more jobs.  All through these troubled times, Ma does her best to keep the family together.  Will the Joad family survive? <br /> <br />This movie, like the novel, has become a classic.  The movie was nominated for numerous academy awards, and Jane Darwellwon for best actress, while John Ford won for best director. The portrayal of life on the plains during the dustbowl years is done with great accuracy.  Numerous families lost their farms and land during this terrible time and headed west to find new lives, and their struggle is portrayed excellently by the Joad family.  The acting is excellent and the story is moving.  There are many acts of kindness during the film, such as the scene where the diner waitress agrees to sell the Joads a loaf of bread and then sells the young Joad children candy for a penny.  The scene where Ma Joad shares her meager food with the hungry children at the worker camp is moving, too. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The acting and story are great, and the historical aspect of the time period is handled perfectly.  Watch this classic movie and see what the lives of the migrant farmer families of the dustbowl years were like.
1400064287|3.0|This book defines the attributes of sticky ideas. The principle of stickiness is important for everyone, whether you need to remember to pick up flowers for your wife's birthday or you're trying to drive a new course for the country. Sticky ideas are powerful ideas.    Unfortunately, the writing style hurts the presentation. In what I took to be a smarmy, West-coast, too-friendly style, the authors comport themselves like televangelist hucksters selling snake oil for what ails you. This style of writing has at its core feature the insinuation that you, the reader, have something wrong with you and that they, the authors, can cure you of it. Similar styles are seen with self-help guru books and diet books. \\"Just follow these simple steps and you too can be XYZ!\\".    It detracts from what is otherwise an immensely useful book. They do have a plan, called SUCCESs, which provides a framework for formulating the presentation of your ideas into something 'made to stick'. They provide many examples and counterexamples of sticky ideas. At the end of each section, the authors provide a small review section which compares the differing presentations of an idea and judges each presentation according to their SUCCESs criteria. As you get further into the book, you'll find yourself wanting to apply the criteria to your own ideas.    The content is good, but the writing is unfortunate. It's an easy and quick read, and it ought to help anyone who needs to present their ideas (i.e. everyone). You won't kick yourself for buying this book. 3 stars.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  I'm a huge Belinda Carlisle fan, and if you are like me, you must listen to her sing French before you die.  Difficult to choose a favorite cut on here, but I'd have to go with \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" a song that used to get on my nerves when Luna sang it, but with Belinda's vibrato, it becomes near ethereal.  I went with the Bonus CD edition, but I have yet to take the French version out of my CD player. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000GTLQXU|4.0|I know I'm in in the minority of people who like this movie and it actually isn't as bad as most people make it out to be. Sure, the acting could've been better and the intro of the movie could've been longer but the amazing special effects and the fast paced action totally makes up for somewhat lackluster character display. My favourite scene is the capsizing and I'm impressed with how realistic the wave looks. Seeing that CGI-water is very hard to make, the special effects people did a fantastic job in that department! I've seen the original 1972 version too and while that had better characters, this one picks the longest straw when it comes to special effects. The underwater explosions inside the boat are breathtaking and the final groan we hear from the ship as it sinks at the end makes us realize Poseidon's days has been counted. All throughout the movie it feels like we're on the ship being part of the surviving group struggling to make it out of the boat and there really isn't a dull moment in this film. The extra DVD with the bonus materials is pretty interesting too, you learn about the rouge wave phenomenon and they interview sailors who experienced being capsized by rouge waves. There's even a part about a norwegian oil platform that got capsized by a rouge wave in the North Sea and I found that particularly interesting seeing that I'm from Norway myself. I had never heard about that before and had no idea that rouge waves could be found in our very own North Sea. The Behind The Scenes is also fun to watch and the sets they made are nothing short of impressive. I also liked how they used an actual nightclub in Los Angeles for the nightclub scene, they made an exact upside down copy of it and trashed it lol. I always buy DVD's with lots of bonus material on them, most of them are very fun and interesting for a little insight into the making of a movie and this one is no exception. <br /> <br />Recommended if you want nonstop action and not a soppy love romance story. As the TV ad for this film said \\"It's Titanic - but without the boring romantic scenes!\\"

0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is a beautifully crafted, uniquely written tale of hope, love, and despair.  From the beginning I felt so attached to Liesel and kept turning the pages to find out how her life unfolded:  the people who touched her and the events that shaped her world amidst the treachery of war.  Liesel and her friends and family are characters who will stay with me as I pass this book on to others and as I keep it to re-read myself.  The Book Thief is a true joy.
0374105235|5.0|At times, the feelings of depression and desperation are overwhelming as Ishmael Beah describes how he and his friends searched for their families while running from the rebels to survive. The fear of being murdered is constantly there, lurking in the shadows. I was truly blown away by  Beah's story of being a child soldier forced to grow up too soon and witness and participate in such horrific atrocities aginst mankind. Children slaughtering other children is unthinkable yet that is exactly what Beah was forced to do in order to survive. Even when hope seems to be near, the danger resurfaces and violence erupts all around. It is a compelling and moving memoir that everyone should read.
0060853980|5.0|I hope you're ready, because the world is about to end, this Saturday!  At least, that's what Agnes Nutter predicted in her book of prophecy, the only completely accurate book of prophecy known to exist.  Too bad she was burned at the stake, eh?<br /><br />This novel was captivating and hilarious, from the cast of characters to the \\"bonus material\\" at the end.  Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are immensely talented, and have a great gift for comic timing and suspense.  The interactions between the human characters are spot on, which only makes the intrusion of the supernatural characters that much more absurd.<br /><br />What pleased me most of all is that my kids (precocious young teens) can both enjoy this book - I am not concerned about adult material in it that they're not ready for.  I know they'll love every page of it, just as I did.  I just wish it could be a movie!
B00011RPB0|5.0|What a movie. While more American movies are not this subtle ,this film exceeded my expectations. Starting with the opening scene (bootylicious Scarlett!!) this movie looks more like an indie flick than mainstream. Even the soundtrack is wisely used. I am a huge fan of Bill Murray and here he is so subtle, using his facial expression that talks more than a Tarantino's dialogue to describe a character. You see his face and you know what's going on in his life. Scarlett Johansson is very good as the young but unsatisfied wife of a photographer interpreted by Giovanni Ribisi. The chemistry between Bob and Scarlett is credible despite the difference of ages. The final scene is just a gem with the now iconic \\"Bob whispering in Scarlett's ear\\" while saying good-bye for good and you'll hear \\"Just like honey\\" by The Jesus and Mary Chain. Sniff! Yeah I cried too. Buy this movie!
141931176X|2.0|I'm always a bit concerned when I read something that uses a lot of creative license on actual history.  I have to wonder how the descendants of Vermeer feel about his family being portrayed in such an unpleasant light.  Though it is a work of fiction, it still seems cruel to saddle someone's name with traits that are not necessarily theirs (true, they could have been horrid people, but we don't know).  I think the experience with the movie A Perfect Storm has soured me completely on that.  The secondary characters (the man with the two girls on the boat) were real-life people.  I saw the TLC special where they interviewed them.  The man was a perfectly competent sailor, the girls complete freaked-out ditzes.  And yet, the movie shows them as the calm, competent ones and him as a drunken sod. That sort of cavalier treatment of the truth rankles.  Granted, in this case, the truth is not known, but that does not give anyone the right to make it whatever they want.<br /><br />That nagging point aside, the book was slow and plodding, but rich in detail.  She tied a lot of tangential points into the storyline that made it a wonderfully rich and complex story that was pleasant to listen to.  It wasn't overwritten and the only character I had problems with was Griet herself.  She seemed a bundle of contradictions - she wouldn't show anyone her hair, because that wasn't proper, but she let Peter have his way with her in the alley?  I couldn't wrap my head around her inconsistencies.  The rest of the characters seemed plausible, if not all likeable.<br /><br />My last criticism is with the ending.  I think it would have been far better to leave us with her standing at the compass, having made her decision where she had to go - but not telling us.  The last chapter was a big let-down, and felt like it was thrown in just to tie up loose ends.  But considering the nature of the book, I think I would have rather let the ends dangle.
032147404X|4.0|I recently bought one of the super-zoom point and shoot cameras.  While researching, I came across a lot of recommendations for this book, so I bought it.  Definately not a mistake.  This book is exactly what a new photographer needs.  Instead of a bunch of theory, you get real world solutions to various problems you may have getting that great shot. <br /> <br />About the only thing that I think could be improved is the layout of the topics.  Since this is so good for a new photographer, I find it strange that one of the first chapters covers wedding photography.  There's not a lot of amateurs that would tackle a wedding.
B000002J2B|5.0|Not only did the members of Genesis survive the departure of eclectic frontman Peter Gabriel in the mid 70s, they absolutely thrived, freed from the obtuse, murky story songs that Gabriel often concocted. This, their second album after the departure, is a tour de force of Prog rock by four distinct, talented musicians. The eye-opening \\"Eleventh Ear of Mar\\" (which Genesis opened their '77 tour with), the Epic \\"One for the vine\\" and the majestic \\"Afterglow\\" are highlights, but none moreso than the instrumental \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers\\", which showcases the astonishing guitar skills of Steve Hackett. With each increasingly poppy album, diehard fans more and more missed classics such as this album. Only 1980's \\"Duke\\" comes close to the quality of this offering. And for non prog-rock fans, \\"W&W\\" is surprisingly accessable.
B000002QWD|5.0|I bought this for my mom, who grew up listening to my grandmother's vinyl White Christmas album... This is wonderful Christmas music that is warm, and fun, and timeless.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|There is lots of talk saying that though Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film, it is the wrong film to be rewarded for. To be perfectly  blunt... it isn't his fault that the academy passed up on all his other masterpieces before allegedly setteling on this one. To go a bit further, I don't think this film is a masterpiece per se', but it is pretty damn near perfection.  <br />The irony of it all is that this film is ctually a remake of an oriental thriller called \\"Infernal Affairs\\" (I believe... haven't seen it and nor do I care to) <br />Still, this is a thriller that is expertly crafted and intricately unraveled. The story begins with a boy recieving groceries from a powerful mob boss (played with typical flair by Jack Nicholson) who then grows up and enters the police force. The young man is Matt Damon and he is working secretly for that very mob boss while posing as a cop. Enter Billy Costigan (Dicaprio) as another cadet who is not exactly cop material but has something more useful that flags him for undercover duties. He ultimately gets tagged with the job of bringing the mob boss down. Unfortunatley, it quickly becomes clear to both men that there are other players in the mix and other road blocks to them both achieving what they desire. Ironically, both men share a love interest (the stunning Vera Farmiga) yet they never find  out about each other although it is alluded to near films end.  <br />The thriller moves at a modest pace, slow and clunky at times... but it all adds up to more meaningful story and fateful climax. I was told that there were many twists and turns but I didn't really notice any... save for one. Yet, the intensity of the plot and the unpredictability of the mortality of certain characters kept my attention glued to the screen. When this film needed to, it upped the ante and delivered on the thrills. All the actors did wonderful jobs and any of them could have been nominated for the supporting actor role. Whaldberg was quite good soit was nice that he got the nod.  <br />So, it may not be a masterpiece but it certainly delivered... and apparently it was intriguing enough to earn the director the gold he deserved for all his previous efforts.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's great to have this classic on DVD.  I love this film!  I always enjoyed watching it with my mom as a kid.  I'm 30 and not always into classic films, but this is definitely an exception.  It's long, yes, but it's one of the most inspirational movies ever made - and it doesn't have to be Christmas to enjoy it.

Just goes to show you that Oscar Wilde was right - Life does indeed imitate art, and here we have another fine example of that theory in The Secret.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is one of those movies not generally well known to the public at large, even to those who liked the Matrix trilogy.  For me, besides the truly awesome action scenes, the gradual psychological development of the main character (Christian Bale) was very well played out and believable.<br /><br />The director, in my opinion, did a marvelous job to allow this movie to transcend well above a mere 'kick-butt' tale.  The story describes a member of the elite who gradually and reluctantly is coming to the realization that he has been deceived by a totalitarian ideology.  The movie guides us through this ephipanic process one step at a time.<br /><br />Well recommended!
0609610570|3.0|I have become a fan of well-written business books.  The information in these books is organized in a way that the information becomes knowledge.  The title of this book was auspicious:  \\"Execution:  The Discipline of Getting Things Done.\\"  What business person at any level of responsibility would fail to be intrigued and enthused about a book with such a great title?  The problem is that the book fails to fully execute on its premise.<br /><br />This book is filled with lots of great information.  However, this book is also filled with a lot of stories.  The stories also have lots of information, but by the time you reach the end of each section it is easy to lose sight of the original purpose of the section.  The end result is that the book seems to struggle to get to the point.  The bizarre thing is that the book does get to the point, but the stories intrude and distract from the points so that you think the book never got there.  The essential problem is that the reader has to work too hard to mentally organize the authors' information into knowledge.<br /><br />This book could become a great book if it was reorganized.  If the stories were removed from the body of each chapter and placed in a section titled \\"Case Studies,\\" \\"Observations,\\" or something similar (stories we included to bulk this book up to a saleable length also comes to mind in some cases), then the sections could be read to understand the points followed by readings of the examples.  Then we could divine the authors' points before reading stories that enhance the examples.<br /><br />My conclusion is that the authors' failed to have the discipline to write a readily readable book, which means they had the discipline to get the book done, but not to get the book done right.  We know as business people that poor execution is sometimes worse then no execution at all, and such is the case here.  If you are seeking a book with great wisdom regarding techniques for execution, this book is not it.  If you are looking for lots of stories about how people failed to execute, sometimes executed, and sometimes recovered from failed execution, and you are willing to read lots of distracting stuff in between, then maybe you have the patience to glean the knowledge that exists in a disorganized fashion in this book.<br /><br />This review is based on a copy of the book provided to me for review.<br /><br />Good Luck!s of stories about how people failed to execute, sometimes executed, and sometimes recovered from failed execution, and you are willing to read lots of distracting stuff in between, then maybe you have the patience to glean the knowledge that exists in a disorganized fashion in this book.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|I think that the artistic prowess of some bands tends to be affected by changes, and Korn has gone through some.  Korn still provides a reliable source of good heavy music while not compromising the underlying dynamics of the \\"sound\\" of the namesake.  I like the way Johnathan still relates to the raw animal relationships of men and women.  His feeling and description still pour through the sound and lyrics of some of the best songs on the album.  Having been a long time Korn listener, and my appreciation of how artists evolve and change, I am not disappointed in the least.  This is the first Korn album I have bought in 8 years, and I think it offers a helluva lot more than any Marilyn Manson album ever has, and comparatively speaking the last couple of Tool albums as well.  At least Johnathan hasn't gone drag.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|I think the Searchers is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Mainly because, faced with seeming insurmontable obstacles, Wayne keeps searching for his niece for years.  It is amazing how the years pass in the film, and you realize, what it must have taken for the character to keep trying, driving himself day after day.<br /><br />There are some cute moments in the movie, but John Wayne's passion to find his niece is just a classic piece of film making.<br /><br />I remember watching a special about the movie and was intrigued at how much work went into filming on location in Arizona.  Ford really was a motivator and a genius when it came to film, and this was one of his favorites from what I remember.<br /><br />If you like John Wayne movies, you just love this.  Natalie Wood does a great job as his niece grown up.<br /><br />I think it is a great lesson of life, however, the interest here is that in a time when murder and mayhem reigned in the Southwest, the passion of the time saw extremes in hatred on both sides of the racial divide.<br /><br />Finally, it is really just a great story and very well done movie.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Sorry about the awful sentence structure in the review title. Just ask any copywriter (okay, I happen to be one), headlines are murder.    And about that rabbit reference, anyone who's seen or even heard of \\"Darko\\" knows that there's a rather odd-looking, man size rabbit-like character named \\"Frank\\" appearing in this film. While he's definitely no Bugs Bunny, he does set some looney toons type moments in motion.     Example? At Frank's behest, Donnie floods his school and buries an axe in the head on the school mascot statute. It's funny too see at first, but after a moment you also realize it's pretty creepy.    But despite Donnie's tendency to turn a little destructive when Frank talks to him, this movie isn't about a tennager going off the deep end and turning into an axe murderer.     In fact, it's hard to generalize as to what this film is about. It's about being a teenager in the eighties. It's about relationships. It's about time travel. Trust me, it all makes sense in the film.      It certainly doesn't tie everything up in a neat package at the end. But that doesn't mean the ending isn't one of those that leaves you hanging. It does come to a definitve conclusion, one that actually pretty much brings you back to it's starting point.    Okay, you just have to see it to appreciate it. It's a film that makes you think about what you just saw and what the meaning of it all was. In fact, a small cottage industry has grown based on ferreting out the meaning of,  and events in, \\"Donnie Darko.\\"    The acting is great throughout. The storyline provacative.     After viewing it for the first time, you'll probably do as I did and start combing the Internet for the book \\"The Philosophy of Time.\\" Oh, a bit of a warning if you do start googling \\"Donnie Darko,\\" the original site, [...], has been hijacked by some Internet squatter. Don't click on any of the links there and reward this guy for hijacking a url.    But do visit some of the other sites you find. They add moresubstance to the whole \\"Darko\\" experience.
B000NHQLPS|4.0|As compared to previous movie of the year winners like crash and billion dollar baby ect... this does not quite make it, but a good mob movie. It is a slow builder, and telegraphed quite a bit, but near the end, thing pick up, get messy, and a few surprises. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio do a pretty good job, but Jack Nicholson's role is just a bit flat, not a convicing crime boss for me. The story follow two police academy cadets throug two different lives. One who is from the underground trying to be a straight Cop, the other a straight and narrow upbringing, going deep undercover and into the crime world. Overall though, the story line and the interwoven tales works well, worth seeing in the theaters, renting, and possibly buying.  <br /> <br />This is a really nice tin, with the two disc special edition, metal case, and a script with special artwork.  Worth the investment if you are a big fan, and like ganster movies.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This movie has become part of the popular culture in a way that few movies have.  One sees references to it in other movies, TV shows, and even some books.  When it first came out it was considered hyper violent and extreme to the point of self-parody.  And it is.  However, so many other films have copied some of its elements that one can see past all the explosions and gun fights to see some of the other aspects of \\"Die Hard\\" that make the movie work in a way that many of the \\"big boom\\" movies do not.<br /><br />One aspect is simply that Bruce Willis plays John McClane with a very nice mix of vulnerability and confusion to go along with his near super hero fighting ability.  His trademark wise cracks also add some humor to a movie that could have been relentlessly violent.  Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt Powell is also a great human touch to the movie.  He grounds McClane and gives him a friend and supporter when the bad guys AND, the local cops, and the feds are against him.  He also provides a balance for all the cops who assume that McClaine is one of the bad guys if not THE bad guy.  That attitude is shown most directly by Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (played perfectly by Paul Gleason who died too young in 2006 at 67).<br /><br />Bonnie Bedelia plays Holly Gennero McClane in a very interesting way.  In the beginning of the movie, she confuses us.  Are we supposed to admire her independence in moving across the country with her kids and abandoning John or are we supposed to dislike her?  That she uses her maiden name, in 1988 probably moved her a couple of feet into the unsympathetic category.  And this is important, because our movement to admiring and then liking her is more powerful if we start not liking her much.<br /><br />Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber gives one of the classic performances in film.  Everybody who has seen this movie remembers this role vividly.  And it put Rickman on the map as a movie star.  It really is a great performance and a great villain.  Alexander Gudunov was much better known than Rickman, and his scene chewing performance got him a lot of notice (and in a way type cast him), but it is Rickman's cool headed monster that we remember most vividly.<br /><br />Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as the computer genius is also a role we remember vividly.  Not so much for the technical wizardry the role requires of him, but his cold cheering for the destruction of the police trying to enter the building as if he were calling a football game.<br /><br />William Atherton should get a special award in Hollywood for being willing to play these characters we all hate.  He does it so well that it has to be hard on him when he goes in public because people probably treat him roughly, assuming he is one of the jerks from his movies.  Here he plays the TV reporter slime Richard Thornburg.  He isn't exactly \\"bad\\", but rather so solipsistic that he cannot see how they way he does his job is inhuman in the way it uses other people.<br /><br />The movie has so many other wonderful characters who add their own touch to the movie that I cannot list them all.  I think of the two FBI guys named Johnson, and Argyle down in the Limo waiting for McClane and then getting involved more in the story than he ever expected.  Or Hart Bochner as the coked out sleaze Harry Ellis.  Or James Shigeta as Takagi with just the right dignity and humanity.  There are so many more nice small performances that make the film as good as it is.<br /><br />A classic film telling a story that anyone who has seen the movie will remember.d a great villain.

Here he plays the TV reporter slime Richard Thornburg.  He isn't exactly \\"bad\\", but rather so solipsistic that he cannot see how they way he does his job is inhuman in the way it uses other people. <br /> <br />The movie has so many other wonderful characters who add their own touch to the movie that I cannot list them all.  I think of the two FBI guys named Johnson, and Argyle down in the Limo waiting for McClane and then getting involved more in the story than he ever expected.  Or Hart Bochner as the coked out sleaze Harry Ellis.  Or James Shigeta as Takagi with just the right dignity and humanity.  There are so many more nice small performances that make the film as good as it is. <br /> <br />A classic film telling a story that anyone who has seen the movie will remember.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|As compared to previous movie of the year winners like crash and billion dollar baby ect... this does not quite make it, but a good mob movie.  It is a slow builder, and telegraphed quite a bit, but near the end, thing pick up, get messy, and a few surprises.  Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio do a pretty good job, but Jack Nicholson's role is just a bit flat, not a convicing crime boss for me.  The story follow two police academy cadets throug two different lives.  One who is from the underground trying to be a straight Cop, the other a straight and narrow upbringing, going deep undercover and into the crime world.  Overall though, the story line and the interwoven tales works well, worth seeing in the theaters, renting, and possibly buying.
038073186X|4.0|*Ow*<br /><br />I have a literary hangover from reading this book. I finished it last night and the crazy characters infected my dreams. It was so brilliant and held me fast for so long. It wavered only in one place where I questioned why Teddy was doing what he was doing. I'm not one of those people who figured out the ending early. It didn't hit me until almost the very end.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />After I read the book, something was bugging me badly about the Prologue. So, I re-read it and found that the character who speaks in the Prologue says one or two things in a way that he would *not* say in light of the entire story. It's a setup and deception that was not necessary to throw me into the strong hands of the waiting story. I would have blindly walked right into them anyway.<br /><br />And, honestly, as I thought about it, I was a wee bit disappointed by the ending. (Hence four stars and not five.)<br /><br />But still, it was extraordinary. Lehane is an amazing writer. Yes, maybe Mystic River was slightly better overall, but I enormously enjoyed the ride this one took me on.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|STRANGER THAN FICTION is one of the more wise, conceptually stunning, finely executed original films to come to the screen in a long time.  How this little gem of a film went unnoticed by the Academy is anyone's guess, but viewers' alert: spend an evening viewing this film and new standards for excellence will be set for you.<br /><br />Director Marc Forster ('Finding Neverland', 'Monster's Ball', 'Stay', 'Everything Put Together') is a director of vision, a man unafraid to tackle testy topics, and a genius at pacing a film with a keen collaborative eye with his cinematographer, his editor, his set designer, his casting director, and his actors.  Taking the chance of working with first time writer Zach Helm (a gifted artist whose niche in the business is already secure with this first venture) and assembling a cast of some of our finest actors proves successful in every graphically odd twist and turn of this unusual, compelling and unclassifiable story.<br /><br />Harold Crick (Will Ferrell - finally given a role in which he can prove that he is an actor and not just a foolish pratfall comedian) is a boring, number obsessed IRS agent whose every moment of every day is timed to be exactly the same (with the important co-existence with his wrist watch!)...until one day he hears a voice narrating his life, the female voice of loopy and blocked writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who is writing a story that has a 'Harold Crick' as her main character.  Only our boring IRS agent can hear her voice: his loony office friend Dave (Tony Hale) empathizes but can do little else to help him.  When the narrator begins to talk about ending 'Harold's' life, Harold freaks and seeks guidance from a literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman, in one of his most subtle and refined roles of his career) who knows Eiffel's work and aids Harold in understanding novels, be they comedy or tragedy. Harold also seeks the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Mittag-Leffler (the always superb Linda Hunt) who is of little help, and Dr. Cayly (Tom Hulce) who repairs all upsets with hugs.<br /><br />Meanwhile in his work of auditing citizens he encounters anti-government baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, once again proving that she is one of the most formidable talents in film today), and a bizarre but tender attraction slowly ensues.  And all this time novelist Kay Eiffel is struggling with how to 'kill Harold' so that she can complete her novel. Her publisher sends in 'assistant' Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to ground her and guide her to her novel's completion by helping her observe hospital disasters, vantages, and steadying her grip on life.<br /><br />The manner in which the novel is finished which involves the ultimate fate of Harold and the changes the narration of the novel have had on his life makes up the resolution of the story.  And a cleverly written conclusion it is.  Zach Helm is obviously a brilliant, well-informed writer who knows how to balance comedy and tragedy, crises of life with the little things that count, and can mold conversations so subtle that they beg to be rewound to enjoy the words repeatedly.  Forster wisely uses graphic superimpositions of numbers and graphs and lines to show us the inside of Harold's intriguing mind, all the while allowing us to draw close to the needy and tender aspect of this nerd of nerds, thus making the involvement with his narrator, his girlfriend Ana, and his doctors and professor wholly credible.<br /><br />Some people (this viewer being one) avoided this film in the theaters because of the fear that it may be just another Will Ferrell bit of foolishness: over the top slapstick physical comedy that grows stale after about five minutes.  But Will Ferrell here opens an important new door for his career: he can act!  The ensemble cast could not be improved upon and it is refreshing to see the widely disparate types of actors gathered here work as a cohesive and impeccable unit.  Added to the DVD is about an hour's worth of featurettes that are, for once, brilliantly informative and well worth viewing to enhance the film just experienced.  Bravo to the entire cast and crew of this little masterwork!

B000LXH0AE|3.0|I saw somewhere where it said \\"Best Comedy of the Year\\".  How was this a comedy?  Was a good movie, just wish they would have presented it as what is WAS instead of a comedy.  If you go in thinking it WILL be a comedy you will be in for a suprise.  Touching and sweet movie that starts out a little odd but makes up for it later.
0345451325|5.0|This happens to be the prequel novel to Halo. This being said, it is actually a really amazing work of fiction. I think even people who are generally not into SCI-FI would really be drawn in by it's compelling characters and frantic story line. Every chapter literally leaves you wanting for more. They set up the story in such a way where it is immediately interesting, as opposed to other books which often times write the introduction chapters in a rather bland way. This book sucks you in rather immediately. I think a judge of good writing is also how well the writer can make you become emotionally attached to the characters and what is going on in the book. I found myself rooting for the main character, as well as supporting ones, and gasping when certain events took place, hopeful at the outcome of the story. The action is written very well, each scene playing out perfectly in my head. This book can easily be read by anyone and can stand alone from the video game without anyone having to play it. I highly recommend anyone who likes a good, intense, and emotional story to pick this book up!
B000M4RG42|4.0|Having seen the companion film \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" first in the theater, I think the memory of that superbly executed film adds a dramatic resonance to this one, even though this war epic was released first in 2006. Moreover, the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, upon which this film is based, is a mesmerizing read, and the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis is a relatively faithful and eloquent adaptation. For all these credentials, this film just misses greatness in spite of Clint Eastwood's masterful direction and first-class production values.<br /><br />The primary flaw is in the way the non-linear narrative is structured as it intersperses the graphic Iwo Jima battle sequences with the homecoming and cross-country bond-selling tour of three of the six men who hoisted the U.S. flag (the second as it turns out) atop Mt. Suribachi in the legendary photo. On top of this juxtaposition, Eastwood uses the framing device of author Bradley conducting the research that resulted in his book. His father, John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, was the last surviving GI in that momentous picture, a Navy corpsman who was assigned with the Marines that fateful day of the assault. Whereas all six flag raisers were examined in depth in the book, the three survivors are the film's focus, making the others, including the men who put up the first flag, rather shadowy, interchangeable figures.<br /><br />The viscerally effective scenes on the island do not hold back on the almost unwatchable carnage, and a couple of brief scenes appear to mirror the events depicted from the Japanese perspective in \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\". The film brings up intriguing insights into both the nebulous perception of heroism and the mercenary financing necessary to maintain the war effort, especially as both aspects manifest themselves on the way the elder Bradley, along with fellow heroes Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes, respond differently to the homefront adulation. The final scenes emphasize sentimentality and weaken the movie's flow considerably as the perspective and context changes. Nevertheless, there are many truly moving and powerful moments throughout, and Eastwood's craftsmanship manages to triumph over his storytelling skills.<br /><br />It's somewhat disappointing that the performances vary as much as the characters. As Gagnon, Jesse Bradford brings a plaintive quality to a paper-thin character who welcomes his celebrity status as he is prodded by his fame-baiting girlfriend. Ryan Phillipe comes across as even less defined since he has to play Bradley as an elliptical mediator. A genuinely weak link is provided by John Slattery, all bluster and no depth as a Treasury Department official. Adam Beach, however, is a standout as the tortured Hayes in a gut-wrenching performance as an alcoholic constantly patronized as an American Indian and riddled with guilt over those who sacrificed their lives on the island. As with \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", Tom Stern's muted cinematography and the late Henry Bumstead's period production design are superbly rendered. I'm really surprised at the sparseness of extras on the 2007 DVD - no director's commentary, no scene selections, no making-of feature, just two previews, \\"Babel\\" and unsurprisingly, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\".n the movie's flow considerably as the perspective and context changes.

B000LW7UR8|2.0|This is the third distinct edition of this CD to be released in the US. It follows the original, standard release and a \\"limited edition\\" version which came with a bonus DVD. This edition contains three songs (two original tracks that have appeared on UK singles and a cover of Kate Bush's \\"Running Up That Hill\\" that has already been released on CD several times) and an alternate mix not included on either of the prior versions. It also omits one song from prior editions of the album. In other words, Placebo, or more likely their record label, expect you to pay another $12+ to get another two or three songs and, furthermore, to ensure that you don't simply sell, gift, or trade off your old Meds CD, they've omitted one track so that you (theoretically) need to have copies of at least two editions to get all the tracks. And the RIAA wonders why people \\"steal\\" music. Maybe it's because they're tired of being stolen from.<br /><br />All of this aside, Meds is an excellent album. If you haven't bought (or otherwise obtained) it yet, this edition would appear to be as good as the prior editions (and it does contain more music than the prior single CD version). If you have already bought this album, PLEASE stand up to the RIAA and DO NOT buy it again.

Right, one of the most important albums of all time.  This is the album that put Dylan on the map and helped make him one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.  If the LP had just 2 songs on it (Blowin' in the Wind and A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall) it would still be a seminal work.  Both of these  songs were eerily prophetic, incredibly powerful and even influenced the turbulent events that were to follow.  Music grew up with the release of this album and no artist to this day has approached Dylan's powerful ability to communicate through song.  Lennon/McCartney: terrific. The Stones: wonderful. Springsteen:  great performer.  Ray Charles: a musical genius. If you haven't listened to Dylan, however, you've missed the real thing!

B0001US62I|5.0|Angel Heart combines beautiful atmospheric cinematography, an unsettling soundtrack, and a well-crafted plot with great acting by Rourke and De Niro to create a real masterpiece of the horror genre.  The use of the occult is very creepy and keeps the suspense building, without ever becoming cheesy or overblown as is the case with so many horror movies.  De Niro projects a truly sinister presence, and the interplay between his character Louis Cyphre and Rourke's boyish Harold Angel is brilliant.  Lisa Bonet adds a smouldering performance as a nubile young voodoo priestess, and has a particularly memorable scene with Rourke (fyi, the special edition dvd is the full, unrated cut of the film, despite being tagged in the description with an \\"R\\" rating).  All in all, one of the best, and worth repeat viewings- do yourself a favor and add it to your collection!

0596009208|4.0|I'm not sure what I can say about this book that hasn't already been said by others. It's an enjoyable if at times daunting look at learning Java. Then again, Java has become quite complex since its inception. Object-oriented programming (especially Java) is not easily learned. Unlike other reviewers who take issue with the humor displayed in this book, I appreciated the author's attempt to explain difficult concepts and then throw in a bit of humor to temporarily lighten things up a bit. Also this book is quite comprehensive in the topics it covers.<br /><br />From the Intro and then chapters on the basics (objects, object behavior, variables, methods, using the Java Library), through more advance topics (like polymorphism, numbers, creating GUIs, and saving objects) to the \\"finale\\" (releasing your code to the world and distributed computing), the authors take a lot of time in explaining how all of these different topics work and how they all tie in to writing functioning Java.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to using this book often whenever I'm looking at (or even writing) Java code.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Great DVD.  I watched it on a Friday night.  It took me back to when I was 10 years old.  My brother and I would sneak downstairs to watch the Midnight Special hosted by \\"Wolfman Jack\\" to see all these bands perform like The Bay City Rollers, Heart, The Eagles, Journey, Fleetwood Mac, Van Halen, Kiss and of course Queen.  Queen was the favorite, they seemed so complex and like chameleons they'd change styles or incorporate something new. Genius........... <br />This concert during 1986 is great and Freddie is in top form. <br />He has so much energy, his vocals are fresh, and he's happy and attractive. <br />The bonus features are great too.  It's nice seeing the whole band before the show and interviews. <br />Also catch Mick Jagger sneaking into see the concert and snippets from Rod Stewart and Elton John. <br />
B0000041TD|4.0|This is a worthwhile and strong version of a great opera, Puccini's \\"La Boheme.\\"  For the most part, the cast is nicely up to the task of making such a familiar opera interesting to attend to.  Elizabeth Harwood is not up to the same standards as some of the other singers, such as the redoubtable Luciano Pavarotti, the wonderful soprano Mirella Freni, and the steady Rolando Panerai.  Von Karajan does a fine job conducting his Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />Act I is exceedingly well done.  It begins with the Bohemians fooling around.  The singing is nicely in character, as Rodolfo, Marcello, Colline, and Schaunard cavort.  There follows the trio of works, \\"Che gelida manina\\" (sung by Pavarotti as Rodolfo), \\"Si, mi chiamano Mimi\\" (sung by Mimi), and the passionate duet \\"O soave fanciulla\\" (Rodolfo and Mimi).  The final high notes are normally sung offstage, but in this version, they seem a bit more muted than in some other versions.  Nonetheless, Mimi and Rodolfo are glorious in this set of arias.<br /><br />The second scene is at the Cafe Momus.  It begins with a lively, energetic street scene.  Well sung by the ensemble.  The high point is \\"Quando men vo\\" (Musetta's waltz), sung in this instance by Harwood.  Her singing is a bit harsh; the pace is a bit lugubrious.  Not a high point.  The ensemble singing after that among Mimi, Rodolfo, Marcello, Musetta, and the other Bohemians is nicely done.<br /><br />Act III is most poignant.  Marcello and Mimi share a scene, and their singing is well done; a bit later, Mimi hides while Rodolfo joins Marcello.  Rodolfo sings of his fears of Mimi's precarious health; as he pours out his fears, of course, Mimi overhears.  She and Rodolfo join in, to overuse the term, a poignant scene.  Meanwhile Marcello and Musetta share insults, in a wickedly sung duet, over the latter's flirting with other men.<br /><br />Finally, Act IV.  This is one of opera's most touching moments. Suffice it to say that the Bohemians and Mimi sing well and bring this opera to a melodic and affecting conclusion.<br /><br />This is one of the best versions of \\"La Boheme.\\"  Pavarotti is in his prime; Freni is still singing well (although I thought that her and Nicolai Gedda's version of this opera was even better).  Well worth listening to. . . .a melodic and affecting conclusion.

0374105235|5.0|A long way gone is the story of Ishmael Beah, a boy forced to fight for a rebel army. The story begins with Ishamael and some friends taking a trip to a neighboring village. While they are away a rebel army attacks their village.  Ishmael and his friends wander the country trying to find their families while struggling for bare necessities in the bush like finding food for themselves and avoiding becoming food for lions.<br /><br />From this position, it is understandable when Ishmael is manipulated into fighting with the government army. The rebels offer him family, a village, and food to eat. He is convinced he is fighting for the \\"good side,\\" the side that didn't kill his family. But Ishmael quickly descends into the the brutal side of warfare and becomes a boy who kills another boys family.<br /><br />Perhaps because Ishmael is still young and hasn't had the chance to develop insight and hasn't lived long enough to develop hindsight, he doesn't delve too deeply into the emotions behind his journey. A Long Way Gone is a factual account of a child soldier. This story lacks a denoument, but it is still worth reading. Prepare to be moved.<br /><br />If you like this book, I also highly recommend \\"What is the What\\" by Dave Eggers.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I've got a review copy of Neon Bible, and here's the deal: it's not nearly as good as Funeral, but no record should be expected to be. Funeral is one of my favorites, and I am positive that Arcade Fire will never make a better one. So it shouldn't be surprising that Neon Bible isn't as good, but it's an excellent record. The main difference between the two albums, at least on the first couple listens, is the band's melodies. The songs on Funeral are just perfect, and the songs on Neon Bible don't have the same kind of permanence. They are, however, damn good. This is one of the best records of 2007 so far. Highlights include \\"No Cars Go\\" (which was also on their pre-Funeral debut EP), \\"Intervention,\\" and \\"Keep the Car Running.\\"

B00005MP58|5.0|I loved this version of \\"Pride and Prejuduce\\" - it is a classic that I don't think will ever be surpassed (though the 2005 movie version was quite good). My beef is with the \\"Bells and Whistles\\" that came packaged with the DVD version.  I was most annoyed with the \\"Featurette\\" which was supposed to cover \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice\\", which, as one reviewer already mentioned, talked to only 2 of the stars (minor ones at that) and the other areas it touched on (choreography, script) were incredibly superficial.  I already own the 6-tape version and bought the DVDs hoping for more background.  The HBO special on the making of the 2005 movie was far more entertaining than this.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I have to give credit where credit is due.  This film does bring up many facts about how we can initiate steps to help our overall environment.  The problem is I keep seeing people isolate it to America, and the film seemed to do the same thing.  This is truly a world issue, so why isn't someone stopping China from putting in over 270 coal fired plants?  Unfortunately, as usual, the \\"rest of the world\\" is not on the same page and yet the finger pointing keeps going to \\"Somebody who drive's an SUV\\".  Of course then they say nothing about the fact that Mount Saint Helens put more destruction towards this problem than any car has.  Regardless, the future is now and we as human beings have a responsibility to do everything we can to save our planet, even though only small percentages are even trying.  The timelines and charts presented as well as the facts about moisture being lost from the soil were very alarming.  I think this would have happened sooner if some of the very supporters would stop trying to isolate blame so as to make political gain.  Al Gore stated himself (at the Grammys) it is not a political issue, but a moral one.  The DVD has some great features and is good at executing educational awareness at many levels.  I don't think it is right to be giving Al Gore the credit though.  The research and hard work that went into this documentary belongs to many people and Al Gore was nothing more than a puppet on a stage reciting statistics.  If you look into what went into this film, you will see so many faces and names of people who have yet to be given credit for their hard work.  It is worth viewing, and I hope everyone regardless of their differences can all come together as human beings to help stop the eventual destruction of this planet.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|WALK THE LINE is a look at the life of Johnny Cash (masterfully played by Joaquin Phoenix), \\"The Man In Black,\\" one of the most well-known and distinctive singers of our time.  The film starts with his humble beginnings, picking bales of cotton with his brother and parents in the fields and gradually depicts his path to show business, after his term in service in Germany and his job as a door-to-door salesman.  While already married and with a couple of children, he encounters the recently-divorced June Carter (brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon), of Carter Family singing fame (of whom he has been a great fan since childhood).  They are drawn to each other, and this mutual attraction intensifies as they embark on a musical tour together, along with a very young Jerry Lee Lewis.  This also takes a gritty look at Cash's descent into speed addiction and alcoholism and June's devotion to him during this, the darkest hour of his life.<br /><br />We hear some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs in this film (with vocals and accompanying instruments actually performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon).  These songs include \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" \\"It Ain't Me, Babe\\" and \\"Walk the Line.\\"  Joaquin Phoenix truly IS Johnny Cash, and you forget that he's even acting.  As for Reese Witherspoon, she earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive and beautiful performance as June Carter-Cash.  Their onscreen chemistry is sizzling and they are never hotter than when they are performing together onstage.  The whole film is a great example of cinema storytelling at its best--everything from the luscious cinematography to the great script is truly in a class by itself.  You will enjoy this film even if you aren't a Johnny Cash fan........Check it out.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I saw this movie with low expectations and had a great time.  The effects are amazing, its made by Roland Emmerich, and the effects are amazing.  To all of those who are breaking this down and stuff stop.  This wasn't meant to be taken as a great docu-drama, go see An Inconvienent Truth.  This was made to be a silly, fun, popcorn type movie.   <br /> <br />Watch this and take it for what it is.  It sucks when people break down movies that are just supposed to be fun.  No plot is right.  But I had a       helluva good time!
0385334206|5.0|I've seen a lot of luke warm and downright negative responses so I had to add my own review. Let me just say.  .  .you have to \\"get it.\\" If you do not appreciate sarcasm, satire, and brutal honestey then you don't need to pick up a Vonnegut book. Admittedly they are not for everyone, but for those of us who find ourselves delighted with Vonnegut's simple, in your face style his books become like potato chips; you can never just have one.
B000M4RG4C|4.0|As the beautiful visuals of Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" unfold, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of battle and forget the point that Eastwood is trying to make: sometimes the real heroes are the ones forgotten, left dead on Iwo Jima in this instance. Everyone has seen the photograph of six men planting a flag on Iwo Jima. It has become a symbol of American valor. However, as we watch the three surviving men being sent back to America on a nationwide tour full of reenactments and autographs, all for the purpose of selling war bonds, the obvious difference between real and fake heroes is defined. The circumstances surrounding the incident are surprising and interesting. <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood does a fantastic job with his direction. This film is not about the entire battle, it only focuses on the flag-raisers and the critical moments for them at Iwo Jima. Eastwood juxtaposes scenes from the battle and from the tour perfectly, and the cinematography is astounding. This film pays tribute to the men who died and still die to defend American freedom, and does so in a respectful fashion, while still being fraught with gunfire and explosions.
B000MR1V22|1.0|This movie is about a family so dysfunctional with situations that are sad and tragic rather than funny - I couldn't get past the first 25 minutes of it and regretted spending $2.50 in rental fees.
B000003TAW|4.0|Weezer is certainly a competent band, but what anchors \\"the Blue Album\\" is the songwriting.  Largely related to the social trials and tribulations of the average high school student, Cuomo's anthemic pop-rock is alternately light-hearted and melodramatic.  As it should be, considering the subject matter.  Of course, one doesn't have to turn in their copy after graduation.  This album came out when I was in 10th grade, and I only got into it more than 10 years later.  It's not that I couldn't relate (\\"...I've got a 12-sided die; I've got Kitty Pryde...\\" - Uh, yeah, that was me), it's just that I wasn't into wallowing in the horrors of teenage social pressure, so angsty stuff was immediately disqualified.  Now I can look back and enjoy the album, and in retrospect its not so angsty after all.   <br /> <br />The truly great tunes here deal with the opposite sex (as they usually do), such as \\"Undone (The Sweater Song)\\" and \\"Only in Dreams\\".  The epic \\"Say it Ain't So\\" is one of the best songs of the decade, period.  The band doesn't waste time noodling around and every track sounds punchy and vital.  Another positive are the exceedingly smart lyrics.  Not smart because they try to be clever - quite the opposite, actually.  Every word rings true, which is quite a feat considering they aren't masked by slick wordplay or attempts at poetic garbage.  Cuomo writes pop songs as perfect as Oasis thinks theirs are.  Somehow, the band filters them through the type of sun-drenched garage sensibility that is usually reserved for SoCal bands only.  Finally, Weezer never overreaches or missteps, making this a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. <br />
B000I5X81A|3.0|I have been a Eric Clapton devotee since I picked up a guitar in 1974. And through Mr. Clapton's songs became a fan of J.J. Cale as well. That being said, I anticipated great things from this collaboration of immense talent. While the CD does offer a couple of interesting tunes the vast majority are too similar, depressing and played on autopilot by both Mr. Clapton and to a lesser degree by Mr. Cale. Another, criticism is that the vocal range of both men are so close that there is a real shortage of multi-part harmony. More backup singers of diverse vocal ranges would have greatly aided this CD.
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is labeled as a \\"Young Adult\\" book for Grade 9 and Up. But this book is oh so much more than just a YA book. This book touched me more than any book I have read in a very long time and I would recommend it just as easily to adults as I would teens.<br /><br />The story begins as you are introduced to the Narrator -- Death. At first, I found it a little disconcerting that Death was telling this story. There are lots of breaks from the actual story when Death gives you glimpses into the lives of the characters that normally wouldn't be shown. But I guess if you are going to tell a story of war, then Death would be the perfect narrator. The story takes place in Germany during Hitler's regime. We first meet The Book Thief, a young girl named Liesel Meminger, on a train bound for her new home. Her mother is very poor and cannot provide for Liesel and her brother. The children are going to live with a foster family, but before the train arrives in Munich, Liesel's brother dies. Her first theft is of \\"The Gravedigger's Handbook\\". She finds it in the snow at the cemetery and keeps it with her always. Her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann are not your typical Germans. Rosa is loud and rude, but has a really big heart. Hans, a painter and accordion player, was denied entrance to the Nazi party for painting over disparaging epitaphs for a Jewish friend. His own heart is certainly in the right place and he sees the Nazis for what they truly are. He also took it upon himself to teach Liesel to read. There are many other characters introduced to us in this story. Rudy, the boy next door, has an obsession with Jesse Owens and becomes Liesel's best friend. There is Max, a Jew. He comes into the story because of a long-ago promise made. There is Ilsa, the Mayor's wife, who grieves for the loss of her son.....but has a library that leaves Liesel in awe.<br /><br />This is a story of innocence and war; politics and anger; hope and friendship. But most of all it is the story of words. It has been a long time since words on a page brought tears to my eyes. But this book did. It is fantastic and I would recommend it to everyone!!t is the story of words. It has been a long time since words on a page brought tears to my eyes. But this book did.

B0009A40ES|5.0|I had to have it, I'm one of those people with a great collection, and building, of the WELL MADE bizarre and thrilling movies.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Well, the 12C is one of two options if you are a CFA candidate, so it is either this or the TI-BAII Plus. I had the TI in college, and it is also a good calculator, but I like this one better. Of the 12C's the 25th anniversary edition is the only way to go while it is available whether it is your first, or your fifth. The case is high quality, slightly bulky, and has a slot on the back for a business card (i guess in case you lose it). RPN is easy to learn, but who ever would have thought that the Polacks would figure out how to do something better and faster. Some thing never cease to amaze me.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|this movie is one of the best performed, directed, edited movies that i've viewed recently. the only thing that i don't quite get is the fiction in this movie, it actually sucks big time. because no matter what, how could it be possibly great to end the main fictitious character's life died like a hero consciously or to let him live happily ever after also consciously, the fiction itself is nothing but a mediocre novel. a real life person coincidentally synchronized with a fictitious character in a novel (a complete narrative one?) is not a bad idea at all, but from what i've sensed from this movie itself, that fiction obviously was not good at all, albeit great in any prospect. what great was the movie itself. will ferrell has transcended himself from an exaggerating comedian actor to a mature, deep, and greater actor in this movie. his performance was right on the money, just right, not more, not less, just fine. a high five for him. and i'll move him up and into my A list absolutely-worth-watching actors from now on.
0240808452|5.0|The way the examples are drawn in the book is through beautiful sweeping gestures, all of them very full of motion.  The book contains very little analysis of the body's physical presence, but this is not a downside at all. Mattesi emphasizes the balance and weight and volume of the form instead of going back to the dreary analysis of human biology (completely necessary to know)that is in so many of my other books.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it for the FIRST life drawing or figure drawing book, but perhaps after a year or so of study of muscular structure.<br /><br />For the price, this book is huge, and an amazing deal. A must-have for any figurative artist or animator.
0140042520|4.0|In \\"The Dharma Bums\\", Kerouac has written another great book about the search for truth and meaning throughout the American countryside. The story is narrated by Ray Smith and is effectively Kerouac telling his own story. Smith and his friend Japhy are wanderers (or bums) in search of the True Meaning or Dharma. The trip covers one year of travels in the life of Smith. His frantic narrative style seems to be fueled by his frequent poorboys of cheap red wine as well as his sheer excitement to be in pursuit of the truth. The story starts in Berkeley, California and visits the Californian desert, Mexico, North Carolina, Seattle and finally ends at Desolation peak in the North Cascades of Washington state. All of these places are reached by hopping on trains, hitchhiking or shelling out a few cents for a bus ride. Interspersed within the descriptions of travel and characters are Zen musings such as \\"It's all different appearances of the same thing\\" as well as meditation on different ideals and places. Kerouac never lets the story slow down and regardless of how accurate the Buddhist ideals are, the rambling, jangly story is quite a ride.
B00005UP86|5.0|It's taken me almost a year to watch this DVD set of Band Of Brothers - not because it's hard going (it isn't) but because I watch almost no television. Band Of Brothers has been almost the only thing that I've watched in the last twelve months and it's all the more impressive for that.<br /><br />Band Of Brothers follows the participation of Easy Company in the 101st Parachute Squadron in World War II. Starting with the Normandy landings and continuing right through to the taking of Berchtesgaden in Bavaria (Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest\\" retreat) the ten episodes, each just under an hour long, are brilliant reconstructions of the war. Each episode has a different tone or theme, sometimes they focus on a different central character, all linked by Major Winters (played excellently by Damian Lewis) and the rest of Easy Company.<br /><br />The realism of the horror, speed and confusion of war is very clear from watching just one episode. The special effects used to show bullets zipping around were unlike anything I had seen before but the series wasn't just about action and fighting, it was just as much about the way that war affected the young men serving who watched their friends die and who sometimes found themselves in almost impossible situations.<br /><br />The episodes are topped and tailed by interviews by the real life soldiers dramatised in this film. Seeing them as old and very American-looking men helped to root the story in reality. Many of them became emotional when talking about the events that had taken place fifty years before - and having watched the series I can see why.<br /><br />As a snapshot of the war, and a warts 'n all snapshot at that, this series is excellent and it's a DVD collection that I can recommend unreservedly.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I've only seen 6 of the 11 episodes of this series but so far it is amazing. I normally think that nature documentaries are boring but this one is awe-inspiring, mesmerizing, and brilliant. Everything looks to real and comes right out of the screen. The regular DVD is around $60 and for an extra $10 you can get it in Blu-Ray.<br />Highly Recommended for anyone who owns a Blu-Ray DVD player.

1904920209|5.0|I have cooked quite a few of the breads from this book.

Good stuff
B000000OPW|5.0|Siouxsie and the Banshees are a band that are almost always being painted into a corner. They are always being saddled with the unwarrented and unnecessary \\"goth\\" tag (or as the band disdainfully refers to it, \\"goff\\"). \\"Tinderbox\\", the band's best and most musically consistent work, is definetly an album that would get that tag; It's lyrics touch on only the bleakest subjects, and there is a consistent theme involving bad weather throughout the album. Even so, the album would be better referred to as gothic rock rather than goth. But, anyway, let's get on with the review. The most famous and talked about song on the album is \\"Cities in Dust\\", a huge hit in both the U.K. and the U.S. and an abosulutely fantastic song. The song is fast-paced and anxious, with singer Siouxsie Sioux howling in a voice that my friends jokingly compare to Bjork. \\"Cities in Dust\\" is a landmark song in gothic rock. There's also \\"Candyman\\", the album's second single and one of my favorites. It's a disturbing song about sex offenders and pedophiles (an intresting fact is that Sioux herself was sexually assaulted at age 9). The best song on the whole album, however, is \\"The Sweetest Chill\\", a fast, furious, and angry piece of gothic rock. It's about longing for a loved one who has passed away. Sioux sings like she's pissed off and means it, and she makes the song so believeable. There are also some b-sides included on the reissue, the best being \\"Lullaby\\", a hypnotic song with sinster overtones. Overall, this is an evocative piece of work that should appeal to any fan of Siouxsie and that Banshees or any fan of dark music in general.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is one of the few albums I own that never, never, never gets old. I mean it! I bought this album right when it came out after liking 'Around the Fur' moderately. I was shocked at how far ahead of the last album this one was! I mean light years ahead! (no disrespect for those who worship 'Around the fur' and 'Adrenaline'.. they are both great albums but simply lack the distinct, brooding atmosphere that the 'Pony' reeks of) I have rarely come across and album as absorbing, and haunting as this.<br /><br />From start to finish, the Deftones bounce back from dark, depressing, atmospheric pieces to violent, heavy tracks that just blend together to create something truly frightening. Chino, of course, stands head and shoulders above the mix, with his droning, dying, beautiful voice. You dont come across something this well put together every day. Intentionally or accedintally 'White Pony' is... amazing... simply amazing..
0316666343|1.0|I loved the reviews of this book and the outline. I was very excited but unfortunately I couldn't get through the first pages. I kept reading and it was just boring. Maybe it wasn't my style but wasn't what I was expecting. I did not like this book at all.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|Cryptopsy seems to be one of those metal bands that just... wont... die... Every release exceeds the standards set by the former album, and every release is just as brutal as the last.<br /><br />'Once Was Not' Isn't just one of the many amazing metal albums that were released in '05, but rather one of the BEST of many amazing metal albums released in '05. (right alongside Hate Eternal's 'I, Monarch', and Nile's 'Ahnihhilation of the Wicked') 'Once Was Not' has just about everything that I look for in a death metal album: Blindingly fast/heavy riffs with enough technical know-how to keep the music interesting, an occasional touch of melody, flawless timing, and inhuman drumming.<br /><br />You want metal? look no further.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The original Celtic Woman concert music spent more than 80 weeks on the number 1 spot on Billboard's world music chart.  There is no doubt that this album will claim that spot also.  This concert filmed at legendary Slane Castle in Ireland in August 2006 is a masterpiece.  David Downes has once again shown his brilliance in bringing traditional Irish and contemporary tunes together is a delightful performance that you will watch over and over again.  Chloe Agnew's The Prayer is absolutely beautiful and flawless.  Mairead Nesbitt's Granuaile's Dance is spirited and has the audience absorbed in the music.  Mairead's energy is contagious and just adds to the fact that she is a first class fiddle player.  Lisa Kelly with her captivating smile and grace are highlighted in Caledonia and The Voice.  Orla Fallon's haunting rendition of Carrickfergus will stir your soul as if she is plucking the strings of your heart.  Meav Ni Mhaolchatha's  rendition of Dulaman and Danny Boy show her mastery of the Irish language and feeling that go into making an Irish tune alive with feelings, warmth, and soul.<br /><br />The addition of Hayley Westenra as the 6th Celtic Woman this year is certainly icing on the cake.  Her rendition of Scarborough Faire is amazing.  Normally I don't like it when people do this song, but Hayley sings it with such passion that you will be speechless.<br /><br />The truth is, there are 6 beautiful Irish ladies with extraordinary voices and abilities, 12 exceptional background vocalists, an orchestra of the highest class of musicians, and one brilliant and talented composer/conductor all assembled for a night of exceptional tunes that you will be humming and singing for days after.  You will feel as though you are right there as part of the audience at Slane Castle when you watch this video.  Buy this DVD and prepare to be amazed by beauty, grace and music that can only be described as \\"a little bit of heaven.\\"
B00008OLYN|5.0|I bought this album expecting a collection of songs done in the format of acoustic passages in standard Opeth style. I had no idea that this album would be a grandoise and truly mesmerizing experience.<br /><br />From start to finish, 'Damnation' destroys any suspicions of being Opeth's weakest and least thoughtful effort. On the contrary, I personally rank this as my favorite Opeth album. Yes, thats right, even above 'Still Life' or 'My Arms, Your Hearse.' What we have here is a stunning collection of progressive and even though mostly acoustic, very dark and brooding passages. You can hear bits of influences from Camel, ELP, and various other progressive classics. Miakel's vocals are very heavily laden with reverb, creating a very strong and mystic atmosphere. This album is a very beautiful and amazingly well crafted aurol journey through space. Unlike most 'soft' parts in other Opeth albums, 'Damnation' is sometimes heavily effect-laden, which adds to the  amazing layered sense of depth that this album holds. Everything, from the complex acoustic passages to the sweeping walls of reverb is executed without flaw.<br /><br />Do not pass this up because it is 'acoustic', this is a very promising journey..
0316172324|4.0|I first read Tipping Point in 2001 and was blown away by its message.  I found myself quoting him at parties, thinking about my life in relation to the book etc.  So I was very interested to read Blink.  But 6 years later, I'm not sure if it was my more advanced knowledge of the topic over time that made it less intriguing or if the book itself was just less ground-breaking.<br /><br />Blink is about how we all make immediate gut decisions on things and we don't even know it - and how this impacts us in both good and bad ways. In Blink, Gladwell's style is to let readers uncover the point of his thesis themselves as he makes his points through a series of short stories.  I admit I got a bit bored by the stories at times, just wanting Gladwell to get to the point rather than labor on with examples. But I found after reading the book that it was the stories that stuck with me long term - meaning the book's value seemed to linger and grow as I thought about it later.  In all, it's a worthy read for anyone that is a student of human psychology - in business or in life.  But I just didn't revel in its message like I did his first book.
B0000033TE|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time albums, as is the case with almost every ELP release. This is one group that you can't easily go wrong with.<br /><br />'Brain Salad Surgery' doesn't seem to stay in one place for very long, but every category that it touches, it does so with exceptional precision, originality, and taste. 'Brain Salad Surgery' generally has a dark, damp vibe throughout. Even though most of these songs are very heavily concentrated on Palmer's extremely elaborate and creative work on the keys, there is (as always) more than plenty to keep you interested. This is one of those albums that is extremely technically intricate, but still listenable enough to say, read a book, or go to sleep to. A top notch preformance and a definate must-have for anyone looking for something experimental, well crafted, and very pleasant to listen to.
B00007AJF8|4.0|I have a theory: audiences are getting smarter. Whereas before a big Hollywood movie with a massive marketing push would've been all the rage, now people are starting to know better. They're realizing that a terrible movie's a terrible movie no matter how often we can see Julia Roberts deal with more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff Michael Bay can destroy. So when a movie comes along like Being John Malkovich, or Memento or even visually impressive like the Matrix, we stand up and take notice. Building a career largely from inventive music videos, first time director Spike Jonze comes out of the gate with probably the most unconventional comedy you'll see. <br /> <br />Loserly Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, always good) is an aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work. Then he has his dishevelled looking wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) leaving in their small New York apartment with pets everywhere since Lotte's a pet store worker. Craig, due to his puppeteering skills gets accepted at a company located, amusingly, on the 7 1/2 floor, complete with cramped ceilings. He also has a strong attraction to one of his co-workers, feisty Maxine (Catherine Keener). One day while working, he discovers a small day and going inside he finds out he can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for 15 minutes with an unceromonious dump on the New Jersey turnpike ditch. <br /> <br />Craig and Maxine get an idea: charge 200$ for people to experience being John Malkovich which is a novel idea until Lotte goes through and feels a deeper connection, especially around the idea of Maxine. Then we have a bizarre love square or star or something since Craig loves Maxine who loves Lotte but only when Lotte is inside John Malkovich...'s head. Try not to wrap your head around it since it's better explained in the movie and after awhile you don't even worry about stuff like vessels or portals, you just go with it. <br /> <br />Casting is of course important and no one seems wasted, even Diaz,who I normally can't stand. The real treat though is of course Malkovich since at times you almost can't tell if he's acting or if he's really that quirky. Then there's the comedy which is subtle to the first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like the 7 1/2 floor and the small ceilings but then the film shows you what happens when Malkovich steps through his own portal and it becomes not only a technical marvel but one of the flat-out funniest things I've seen lately. Only problem with the story is that at a certain point it shifts gears and the film almost speed walks to its climax rather than lurching forward, like it was shot in the foot. <br /> <br />Like the Amazon review says, I don't know if the film can warrant repeat viewings and you can get more out of it every time you see it but that first viewing is quite something.
B0000019PA|5.0|Jeff magnum is truly a genius when it comes to this odd collaboration of pschycadelic folk/pop.. and it takes nothing short of a genious to lure my ears to an folk/pop album.<br /><br />It is very, very rare for an album of this type to catch my ear and keep it for an extended amount of time... but that is exactly what this album has done to me. It has taken me forever to figure out how such simple little song structures and a tone-deaf vocalist could keep me interested throughout the entire album (I am more accustomed to more prog like bands, pink floyd, radiohead, dream theater ect.).. and ive come to the conclusion. The formula mr. Magnum has invented is the key.. Simple three chord songs, all underproduced and a tad on the sloppy side with an off key voice to create an overall 'dirty' yet starkly poppy sound at the same time.. add a tinge of pschycadelia with slight instrument experimentaion and you get a great, dirty, off kilter pop album that is totally unique. (unless you are familiar Syd Barrett's solo work, wich this unmistakingly reminds me of). I just cant get enough of the ugly, yet very listenable sound.. Amazing job Jeff Magnum.. amazing.
B000F3AAUW|2.0|I bought this because of the hit Crazy....and I must admit that Gnarls Barkley has a very impressive voice.  Unfortunately most of the songs on this album sound like they were thrown together by amateurs.  Lyrics that must have been picked out of a wastebasket and arrangements and mixing by neophytes on drugs.  End result is an inconsistent and unsatisfying mix and a waste of a good voice.  I know, there were some who rated this five stars but I'm guessing they have a vested interest in its success. I sure hope that Barkley's newfound popularity lands him a session with professionals because he could do so much better.....and my review would be more flattering.
B000001FFJ|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time.. no more, no less. Its hard for me to understand why I like Rain Dogs.. but then again its hard for me to understand why I like Tom Waits so much in the first place.. I guess he is more of an aquired taste to most people, reguardless, this album is an artistic masterpeice. Waits' lyrics are very poetic and abstract as usual.. and musically there is a balance here that most albums of any genre can't accomplish. There is a perfect mix of serious ballads and quirky, fun, polkas (or whatever you call them).<br /><br />I cant really reccomend this album to anyone who has not heard of or heard Tom Waits.. because this band is rather like Primus in the sense that you either hate it, or love it.. and if you love Tom Waits, then you already have this album.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|The innovative freshness and powerful creativity of Francis Weber at the moment to choose original scripts is something that nobody can discuss. He was born with that clinical eye to pay special attention around the multiple connections between ingenuity, trickery, cheats seen under new perspectives.<br /><br />In a globalized world, as you and me figure out, Weber has found and developed his personal contribution enriching, enhancing and expanding the universe of the humor in its countless possibilities of expression.<br /><br />Dinner game is in this sense, not only a daredevil proposal around those minor sins and hence he has achieved to show those evident smart and effective monkey business in the great tradition of the great literary tradition of classic and irreverent writers, of caustic nature such as Beaumarchais, Moliere or Voltaire.<br /><br />Don' t miss this provocative, imaginative and funny film. One of the best of the nineties, if not the best.
B000006045|5.0|What could I possibly say in this review that hasn't been said already about this monster release from the founding fathers of 'trip-hop'? The answer is... absolutely nothing..<br /><br />Yes this album is as good as they all say it is, and yes it is a necessity to anyone who enjoys electronica soundscapes with damp, dark overtones. 'Mezzazine' is a thouroughly soothing sonic experience, and a delightfully 'trippy' one as well. Layer upon layer of dense atmosphere pile together to form a black mass of low profile hip-hop beats and gut wrenching sampling. I bought this album several years ago and it to this day it still gets play at least once a week. Massive Attack are true genius when it comes to atmosphere.<br /><br />I am personally not a fan of most bands like this, (i-e prodigy) but everything works together so flawlessly on 'Mezzazine' that you can not help but indulge in this brilliance over and over again. A perfect selection of guest vocalists, a perfect mix, and a delightfully dark auora make this album a very satifying experience.
B000GY729M|5.0|This is not the last Killers CD....It's better.  Unfortunately it takes listening to it 3 or 4 times to really appreciate it.  It gets better every time.  The lyrics are more creative and the instrumentals are amazing.  If you only give it once or twice ang give up on it, then you'll miss one of the best albums of the year.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Sure this album is not 'Origin of Symmetry', and yes the progressive hooks seem to be slightly watered down.. But do not fear, this is still an amazingly brilliant and energetic piece of beauty.<br /><br />Amazing from start to finish, and never lacking a powerful, energetic atmosphere, is what 'Absolution' is all about. It may not be as technically advanced as 'Origin of Symmetry' but they still manage to keep all of the great things that made them amazing throughout the entire album. An amazing dose of atmospheric keyboards, flying arpeggios, and that voice! It sounds like a more alive, passionate Thom Yorke couldve sung this. Every song oozes with its own beautiful aoura, (yes including the single) and all is well excecuted.<br /><br />A top notch album from one of the top notch bands of this decade.
0767819659|5.0|My 4yo currently loves this movie, and we've watched it every day for the last few days. I have to agree with another reviewer who commented on one of the early reviews.  Apparently, Madeline is the only one of the 12 girls who is an orphan. I got the impression it was a Paris boarding school consisting mostly of students from England. Lord Covington's wife was probably french (Marie Gilbert), but I'm pretty sure he was British. If you grew up with a fascination for boarding school (ie: Facts of Life fan), you'll probably love this movie.
B000007T2Z|5.0|At three songs spanning a little over an hour, 'F#A#' is a frightening, yet at the same time beautiful and colorful journey. What we have here is unlike anything I have ever heard before.<br /><br />The first album I purchased by these atmospheric artist was 'Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennaes to Heaven', and though I was thouroughly impressed by it, the forementioned does not reach as deep into your soul as does 'F#A#'. While LYSFLATH was a bit more on the minimalistic side, 'F#A#' is a very complex, and dynamic experience. With everything from disturbing monolouges to reverb coated strings, the many different thick layers add a very dark and 'muddy' atmosphere to the overall production.<br /><br />There are many unexpected and exiting twists in this album as well. Just when it seems like you are getting used to the dark and opressive drone, a swift change in tempo and dynamics will bring you right back on your toes and keep you fuled for the rest of the listen.<br /><br />While Godspeed You! Black Emperor is definately not for everyone, this is a true essentual to anyone who enjoys music that paints a grandoise picture.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I See alot of mixed reviews about This album, and you know, I really like it alot.    It's so different than her other albums, I think her voice shows some really strong talent in this album and she really proves to her fans she's capable of any style of music and can make it work.    If your a Norah Fan, and are willing to listen with an open heart and mind, just give it a chance, I feel it's so worth it..
B00007LTIA|2.0|... can find this to be \\"philosophical\\" or deep in any way. Musically decent, as one should expect from musicians of this caliber, but often disoriented and strained to create long pieces, since, presumably, long means \\"complex,\\" \\"artistic\\" and \\"serious.\\" Yeah, right. The irritating, screeching Anderson's voice disturbs as always, but is fortunately not too present, with all the showing off Wakeman and Howe try to pull off. The lyrics are retarded as one is used to get from Yes, not that they deserve any attention. Still, this has the air of naivete and wanna-be artistry that the band would later abandon for pure unadulterated greed and commercialism, starting around the truly disastrous Tormato and on. <br />Two stars - one deserved, for any Yes album, another for the reduction in Anderson's participation.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|A decade in between and she didn't miss a beat.    This album is just amazing, soft, meditative, and entrancing..    I fell in love with this cd the first time through, the flow of this album is a little different then her last ones, but still that soothing calming and protective feeling you get when you listen.    Worth every penny!
B000062XGB|5.0|Anna and the King is a wonderful True movie! Jodie Foster is a very good actress in this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry and happy!
0586091718|5.0|If you want to know who, what, and how you are, and how our universe works, this book will start you on your way.  Being a holographer for 37 years myself, the concepts in this book really hit home.  I bought this book in early 1993 and just re-read it.  It has had a profond effect on my present thinking.  I'm convinced that the concepts in this book are the best model yet we have of how existence works and how we, as a species, work.  Everybody should read this book.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Up until a few years ago my only exposure to The Flaming Lips was that horrible single \\"Vaseline\\" (or whatever it was called) that got a ton of radio airplay back in the late 90's.  I really really really hated that song and totally wrote this band off.  Then in early 2003 I kept seeing this \\"Yoshimi\\" album pop up on a lot of people's \\"best album of the year\\" lists for 2002.  After reading reviews and talking to others who had it I finally decided to pick it up and give this band a chance.  I can happily say that I am glad I did.  This is a fantastic album and one that does not easily fit into any easy categories.  The album is a mix of psychedilea, electronica, pure pop, and progressive rock.  It is really different from anything else I have in my music collection.  The whole album flows together seamlessly in a dreamy floating way.  The lyrics tell the loose story of a girl named Yoshimi who is fighting against evil robots.  The first four songs pretty much follow the story line and then the material kind of drifts away from it.  All of the songs on the album are great from the opening \\"Flight Test\\" through the instrumental closer \\"Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon\\".  It is all a tripy fantasy ride that takes the listener to a dreamy sci fi world.  I don't own any other Lips albums, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but if I definitely need to explore more from this band.
006097625X|5.0|i was \\"forced\\" to buy this book for an art history class.  <br />never would i have picked it out on my own. it's not so much  <br />that i hate comics, but i definitely do not read them as much  <br />as i used to. even then it was all :\\"betty & veronica\\" & \\"katy <br />keene\\" more so for the fashions then the actual comic. after reading  <br />this book, i realize how complex & interesting comics really are. this  <br />book is more of a guide to visual literacy than anything else. it makes <br />you aware of things that you have always taken for granted & explains  <br />to you WHY... excellent book, i recommend it to EVERYONE!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I couldn't wait to borrow a copy from the local library so I rented it earlier this week and have watched it three times.  I admit I'm a sucker for period pieces so that was a big draw, and the Phillip Glass score hit just the right note.  What really grabbed my attention was the acting skill of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti.  The small details such as Eisenheim's (EN) facial expressions when he is told that the crown prince likes to \\"rough up\\" his female companions.  Or the way he stands on stage during a performance.  It's all so perfect and wonderfully endearing.  Paul Giamatti took my breath away as well.  I particularly loved the way he laughed about his discovery in the end.  So child-like and full of joy at the discovery, although the ending you see might just be in his mind... you never really know.  If you have not seen this movie, it's nice to view it with someone you love, because there is a tremendous romance as the core to the story.  In fact I would say that the true magic of the story is the love that the hero (EN) and heroine (Jessica Biel) have for one another.  They are bewitched and bewitching.  I will no doubt be adding this film to my DVD collection.
B000002UAR|5.0|When I recently read again Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of all time again, I was still kind of perplexed by \\"Revolver\\"'s high position.  After all, the modern fan tends to cherish the band's later releases above all. But after listening to it again, there are many ways that this album is the band's greatest moment.  When I wrote a review of \\"Pet Sounds\\" recently - an album that Brian Wilson himself acknowledges was inspired by a desire to match or exceed \\"Revolver\\" - my concern with that album was that the Beach Boys didn't seem to attract the public with that album, and thus its overall influence was not quite so great.  We can't say that about \\"Revolver\\".  Like other Beatles albums before and after, Revolver shot to the top of the charts and stayed there for 6 weeks.  The songs, as well, created a body of influence that \\"Pet Sounds\\" cannot compare with.  While Wilson turned inward and introspective with his work, the Beatles covered a wide variety of topics, from the depths of loneliness (Eleanor Rigby)to the evils of government (Taxman) to psychedelic ideals (Tomorrow Never Knows), all while experimenting with horns (Got to Get You Into My Life), strings (Eleanor Rigby) and still producing melodies with pristine beauty (Here, There and Everywhere). The Beatles were the Fab Four until this album - but from here forward, we would only be able to consider them to be groundbreaking, relevant - and the greatest artists of the 20th century.  I still believe that \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" is the best Beatles album, and likely the greatest in rock history.  But would it have ever happened....if there had not been \\"Revolver\\"?  I frankly doubt it.  Thankfully, it lives on - and the echoes are here...there...and everywhere.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firely is more of Serenity, same cast, same director, same script writer. <br /> <br />It's worth every cent. Really it's entertainement at it's best.
B000J103PC|4.0|I was entertained by this film about a budding journalist who gets a job at the hottest fashion publication in NY.  This young woman is transformed inside and out by the industry that she believed held no importance to her.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is charming as the rags to ritzy journalist.  Meryl Streep is outstanding as the publication hotshot who will do anything to stay on top!  Although, I must admit, I wonder where the Oscar nomination came from.  The supporting cast added memorable moments.  And the glimpse into the fashion world was enlightening in a blurry way since I'm certain that the fashion industry is much more ruthless than was portrayed.
0316066524|3.0|Saying this is a masterpiece is like saying Simon is mean. (You know it or have heard it even if you have never come in contact with either.) David Foster Wallace has a way with words that I can't yet describe. Yet, there is much wrong with this book.  <br /> <br />It is not the oft commented upon length. Yes, it is too long but only because it feels like it should have been edited.  <br /> <br />It is not the lack of an ending. It doesn't need one. <br /> <br />It is not the footnotes. They are amusing and a welcome change from the formulaic fiction that is out there. <br /> <br />It is a combination of those three things and the cult of Infinite Jest that make this unsatisfying IMHO.  <br /> <br />It, like skydiving or running a marathon, is something that many people feel the need to do at some point in their lives. Like those things, I say have at it. But like them, when it is over you may just feel like the build up was better than the climax.  <br /> <br />Still, a must read. I hope to someday get him at his (pared down) best. <br />
0393327345|4.0|A contemporary masterpiece. An underground fight club goes from a way for frustrated men to vent their rage over the variety of emasculations they think they've suffered and becomes a stealthy, destructive movement sworn to topple a false and dehumanized consumer culture. In the thick of the anarchism is the mysterious Tyler Durden, who's<br /><br />charismatic brand of evangelical destruction alternately attracts and repels. Clearly , he is someone you cannot take your eyes off of as he exhorts his troops to<br /><br />pull the rug from under the engines of Industry. Chuck Palaniuk's satire is vicious, masterful, a vision of a bloated culture set on the cutting board , inspecting with a dissecting eye.<br /><br />This is the perfect novel of terrorism, and Palaniuk extends the violence aesthetic of Mailer's \\"White Negro\\" and the various therapies encouraging the psychically wounded to vent until they heal or when the things that are killing them disappears. In both instances, the aim is to free the body from the sterile consumerism its shackled to and to feel alive, and advocates of this sort of expulsion would be quick to add that the violence assumed in their rants and manifestos is metaphorical only; poetry to make a point. Paulaniuk , though, is having none of this grandstanding equivocation on the point; a male either feels that he's had his manhood commoditized and removed from his being, or he does not, and he's willing to take direct action against the symbols and systems of oppression, or there are complacent with a status quo and, hence, part of the problem.<br /><br />The genius of the novel is the author's decision to take the talk of mortal liberation at face value and to follow the logic. Aggrieved males attacking each other , fighting as hard as they can, blows to the body, the head, the groin meant to help them feel something real and independent of programmed responses and advertised results, and in achieving a bond and formed a community, there becomes the united purpose of bringing down the towers of business, the arrogance of faceless, soulless capitalism. Palaniuk's novel is fiction and it is satire, but it is also potent social criticism and disturbingly presents a mindset of a collective for whom acts of grandscale violence, of terrorism are the only sane action possible because they are the only things one can do that means anything. Fight Club is a rousing, disturbing read.s the united purpose of bringing down the towers of business, the arrogance of faceless, soulless capitalism.

B000JBWWRY|4.0|Like some of the reviewers below, I agree that the depiction of the Native characters in this film is pretty off-the-charts insulting (note that Tiger Lily, the only Native character with any kind of actual integration into the plot, is depicted as having a much lighter skin tone and is drawn in a soft, delicate manner utterly opposed by the gross characterizations of the other Native designs, clearly showing that the artists knew full well what they were doing).  I too, will not show this to my daughter until she is old enough to understand the historical context of the film.  And even though this is one of my personal Disney animated favourites, I do agree that Disney might owe Native people an apology (although the studio is hardly alone in this respect), but I do not agree that the film should be edited.  Film, like all art, is a window into our past that should never be altered for the sake of contemporary technical or societal notions.  It's only in examining and acknowledging these situations that we can track the changes (hopefully for the better) that society has achieved.
B000M341QE|4.0|The Good:    * The Acting.  It's time to recognize DiCaprio as one of our most solid actors. Say whatever you'd like about Titanic (which was quite good), he's proven his chops and range in a diverse group of movies including Gilbert Grape, Man in the Iron Mask, the Aviator, (the sorely underrated) Catch Me If You Can, and others. DiCaprio shines here, too.    Oh yeah, and the others in this movie aren't bad actors either, like Damon, Sheen (the elder), Wahlberg and Jack frikken' Nicholson. With a cast like this, you *ought* to be able to come up with a good film. All great actors, all great performances.    * The Plot (to a point).  The premise is solid; you can see why this got made, and so many big names attached to it. The idea is that the mob and the Boston PD both have undercover informants who've deeply infiltrated the other side. While they experience very different lives (the faux-cop lives in a high-rise apartment; the real-cop/sham gangster lives in the slums) externally, they both feel the pressures of leading double-lives, etc. The action really picks up when they each catch a whiff of the other's existence, and it becomes a game of who will smoke out the other first. The plot is intricate and complicated, but in a good way, as the characters strive to one-up each other, and we're always left guessing as to who's playing whom. This is a wonderful plot and idea... which... never actually gets paid off (see: The Ugly).    The Bad:    * The Editing.  I knew the film would win for Best Editing at the Oscars (and it did), and it's a shame, really. I'll say this: the editing is *noticable*, and that, there, is exactly my problem with it. It is my belief that, in ordinary circumstances, editing should be one of those things that goes by, unnoticed, in a film. Editing should proceed in the background. Like referees at a sporting event, if you're noticing them a lot, it probably means they're doing something wrong, and in any event they're taking away from the sport, itself. You know--the thing you've paid your ticket for. With this movie, I wanted the plot and characters, etc., not to see a Film Editor's proof-of-concept.     In the Departed, we get an insane amount of quick cuts with very little to establish scenes; we're just thrown from one scene to the next, often in the middle of dialogue. There's almost no changing of pace to be found; the movie is run, uniformly, at a sprint's pace, despite being of marathon length. Also, there are times when minutes elapse between cuts... and there's a few times when significantly longer periods of time whisk away. There's nothing in the editing, etc., to suggest any such thing, and so contrived lines of dialogue are thrust in to let us all know that \\"well, George, it's been at least a year since we've seen each other... huh?\\" Lame.    After the movie was over, neither I, nor my friend watching with me, nor my fiancee, had any real handle on how long the events of the movie took place over. Based on the frenetic editing, it could've been a week. (Well, the 'adult' parts, at least.)    * The 'Love' Triangle.  So, throughtout the movie, Damon and DiCaprio manage to fall for the same woman. Now... I could say that this hurt the film's sense of \\"verisimilitude\\" by being way, way, way over-the-top/coincidental. And, yes. For a movie so determined to be \\"gritty\\" and \\"realistic,\\" the idea that these two opposite sides of the same coin should manage to meet, fall for, and sucessfully woo the same woman, in all of Boston, is just ridiculous to the upteenth degree.    But beyond that, the love triangle contributes nothing to the plot. Oh, sure, I know some will say that it gives the characters depth, etc. But really? Not necessary. There was already more than enough character material. And the romance doesn't contribute much in the way of characterization or anything else. I was hopeful at one point, because there was an earlier mention of impotence on Damon's part--which could lead one tocompare against DiCaprio's apparent virility (he gets a sex scene, unlike Damon), and come to some sort of conclusion about how \\"crime doesn't pay\\" or something like that. Except that: Damon's relationship lasts over a year, upto engagement and pregnancy, so....     Now, we could construct some sort of conspiracy theory idea where Damon was actually impotent for the entire stretch of their relationship, and so the unborn child is actually DiCaprio's (and I lean towards this last idea, at least), but the idea that Damon could've had this relationship for a year without consummation is... not likely. Also: he thinks the child is his, so he must know something about his chances in that regard.    Now, all of this might be forgiven had the female lead been interesting. But, she's not. Her character is a complete cipher. She doesn't take charge. Doesn't accomplish anything. She's simply another chessboard upon which DiCaprio and Damon play out their little match, and she, herself, adds next-to-nothing to the events of the film. Near the end, there's even the suggestion that she might have some relevance as she receives a Mysterious Envelope. Stunningly, that Envelope isn't ever even opened. Someone forgot what you're supposed to do if you introduce a gun in Act One, if you get me...?    Finally, there's not even a pay-off to the love triangle. Usually, in dramatic affairs, if you have people in a secret love triangle/affair, you'd want \\"the moment of discovery\\" where the two competing lovers learn about each other... right? Well, Damon and DiCaprio spend a year loving the same woman, and never find out about each other. Never, not once. As though the entire love triangle weren't a big waste of time to begin with... another strike against the editor: this material should have been cut.    The Ugly:    * The Ending.  As mentioned above, the plot of the Departed is incredibly complicated. How can a person possibly unravel such a Gordian Knot of intrigue and interesting characterization? It seems like a conundrum without solution, yeah? Unless, of course, you cut the Knot. So, the Departed takes the coward's way out of the sticky situation it's created by simply executing all of its characters, one by one, near the film's conclusion. There's little rhyme or reason to the killing, and it offers nothing in the way of a satisfactory conclusion. You're just: \\"Oh. So, they're all dead now, I guess. Probably for the best.\\" They might as well have had safes drop from the sky on their characters to resolve those pesky conflicts; that, at least, would have been funny.    The only one left standing is Mark Wahlberg, like Fortinbras surveying the slaughtered Danes, except without making a lick of sense or providing any commentary or satisfaction. In short, the ending makes no sense. It's a cheap way out of, what was to that point, a good plot. You can hear the writer go \\"uh... so... what do I do now? Hmmm... well... what if they all get shot in the head?\\" The ending nearly ruins the movie.    Overall:    The Academy decided that this was the Best Picture of 2006. Who am I to disagree? Well... I suppose that, by virtue of the fact that I saw all of the five best picture nominees, it does give me some right to an opinion. And, before the ceremony, I had the Departed as being #4 out of five (I had it over Babel). It's not a bad picture, and has much to recommend it, but it isn't a complete movie. There are plot elements that come in and go out without relevance, distracting editing and an abyssmal ending which is more about saving the writer from difficulty than providing a satisfactory (or even good, sad) conclusion.    The premise and acting are good enough to give the film Four Stars, just not good enough to earn that Fifth.    Four Stars.

6305882592|4.0|Harold (Bud Cort) is 20, Maude (Ruth Gordon) is 79 and a concentration camp survivor; ironically he is obsessed with death, she with life. They meet at a funeral (he loves to attend them), become friends, and she begins to \\"instruct\\" him about the joys of life. In retrospect some of these lessons are difficult to swallow today and represent subversive activities that were often mistaken for \\"freedom\\" back in the early 70s when the movie was made: much of what Maude tries to instill in Harold constitutes doing whatever you feel like doing, especially bucking authority and the law. It's no wonder it became a college cult classic at the time. The funniest parts of the picture are those that show the ludicrous mock suicide attempts made by Harold throughout the proceedings. If you are of a certain age and feel nostalgic for the \\"let it all hang out\\" days of the cultural revolution circa 1971, you will probably enjoy this movie.
1932100660|5.0|I would give this book more than five stars if I could.  I have read dozens of books on health and nutrition, but this is the best book I have read to date.  It is well written, researched, and the conclusions reached are nothing short of profound. The conclusion that there is a direct link between the amount of animal protein consumed and serious life threatening illnesses, especially cancer, is unassailable.  I read this book over a year ago, but decided to read it again.  I have known for a long time that more whole foods (grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes) were the healthiest way to eat, but I did not know how just how bad just an average amount of animal protein was for your health.  I have not cut out all meat and dairy entirely, but I have cut way back on my consumption.  I might also say that when I do now eat meat and dairy I make a real effort to get only healthy, organically raised food.  I have given a copy of this book to my family doctor and recommended it to everyone in my family.  This is an extremely important book, and I highly recommend that you pick it up and read it.  There is a very good chance that it may actually change how you look at food, what you decide to eat, and ultimately how well and how long you live.
B000068FXX|4.0|This is a great CD. featuring 2 of the BEST songs ever written ('Give a Little Bit' and  'Even in the quietest..). Lyrically that song is gorgeous! Not to mention the 11 minute opus 'Fools Overture' (which i personally think sounds better on 'Paris')...  This is a cd with songs that will never get old.. Too bad people forgot how to write good music anymore. Music with passion and feel.. Supertramp delivered always!! especially in the '70's!! Thanks for the great music Davies/Hodgson..
B0002NRRAG|3.0|Occasionally, I buy music based on the strength of one standout song I've heard. That was the case with Careless Love. Peyroux's rendition of Leonard Cohen's Dance Me To The End of Love was so enchanting, I just had to hear more. So, I ordered this CD from an amazon partner and felt a frisson of great anticipation the day it arrived. <br />Well, I am kind of disappointed. Peyroux does have great voice, but overall the CD is far too loungy and retro for me. It would be great as the musical backdrop to a romantic evening, but its never going to be in heavy rotation. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the quality of the music, its just not my style. If I had to pick favorites here in addition to the song for which I bought this, I would have to pick Lonesome Road and the title cut. <br />So if you like sultry, smoky lounge music of the kind you may have heard in the style's heyday, then Careless Love may be for you. But if you anticipate something with more edge, then skip this.
0553383663|4.0|EDIT 10 Dec 07 to point to \\"Google 2.0: The Calculating Predator.\\"  Costs $675 for an online copy, causes panic behind the scenes on Wall Street.  Google for my review book review by the same title.<br /><br />This book is as close to the \\"authorized biography\\" as one can get.  Engineers and investors and competitors should go instead to \\"The Google Legacy\\" by Steve Arnold, sold only by Infonortics UK (online).  End users and third party developers are better off with any of the 50+ other books that focus on penetration testing, analytics, Google Earth, etcetera.<br /><br />The book purports to be a revelation of secrets, but that is simply not true.  This is a compilation of what anyone could have put together from enough coffee house conversations.<br /><br />What jumps out at me is Google's potentially crippling addiction to advertising revenue, its failure to offer sense-making and visualization, and its extraordinary good luck in being able to draw the best talent from NASA, Microsoft, Bell Labs, etc.<br /><br />I am impressed by what Google is doing in becoming a multi-lingual service, and eager to see when they can start offering multi-lingual search with translation on demand for micro-cash.<br /><br />There is no denying the brilliance of the founders in using links as a form of citation analysis, but as anyone who has compared the results from a professional set of sites via Deep Web Technologies, with a Google search, the former is 10 to 1000 times better on any given serious topic.<br /><br />The book is useful for insights into the founders, and especially Larry Page.  One learns of his interest in transportation analytics, and in molecular biology and genetics.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that Jeff Bezos helped the founders in the beginning, but now I have the impression that Google does not play well with others, even those that helped them get started, and that is a shame.<br /><br />\\"The Google Legacy\\" does a much better job on the technical strengths of Google (see also the briefing by Steve Arnold in the Archives at OSS.Net), but this books does note the strength of Google in combining software innovation with scalable economic hardware.<br /><br />Anecdotes include how Google Doodles emerged, the early use of focus groups, and the hiring of a brain surgeon to be the network manager.  There is adequate mention of the 20% free play rule, but insufficient discussion what has emerged from that.<br /><br />On page 143 the author, no doubt misled by whoever he interviewed, claims that \\"CIA agents use Google to track terrorist groups.\\"  Baloney.  Google has a \\"secret\\" relationship with CIA (the Office of Research & Development), and a test was done that produced a handful of \\"hits\\" all of which were worthless and most of which were severely dated.<br /><br />Gmail foundered on privacy issues, as did Google's desktop search.  The author is incorrect when he says that Google has added sufficient security.  The fact is that the US Government is still finding restricted documents leaking out whenever they install Google Enterprise.  I for one would never trust Google on my small business machines.<br /><br />The author describes the division of responsibility among the founders and the CEO: Eric is operations and finance; Serge is policy, politics, and people; Larry is hiring, priorities, and physical space.<br /><br />While the author describes the Google digital library projects, he fails to satisfy.  .<br /><br />Google's idea for satisfying publishers by using the content only to entice the reader to buy the book is either idiocy, or a subterfuge.  Presumably Google knows that synthetic information is free of copyright, but they seem loath to take the easy step of offering footnotes or micro-text extracts for micro-cash.  In this regard, they really should be merging with Amazon and the Internet Archive (Brewster Kahle) to create a world library that can be translated into all languages on demand, given for free to the five billion poor, and monetized by using Doug Englebart's Open Hypertextdocument System (OHS).<br /><br />The book ends with a few pages of \\"tips\\" on how to use Google that are nowhere as good as Nancy Blachman et all \\"How to Do Everything with Google,\\" or Arno Reuser's briefing at OSS.Net on the open source intelligence system of the future.<br /><br />I end the book with a small diagram that is NOT in the book, it is my own intellectual property, but it is a useful means of evaluating why Google is not as good as it could be.  On a compass, SEARCH is West; SENSE-MAKING is North, SHARE is East, and Saving the World is SOUTH.  Google sucks at three of the four, and that may be their epitaph.<br /><br />I asked a very smart person why Google does not play well with others and is so slow to reach out (see the two images I have loaded to the book on Wikinomics) and he had a direct answer based on direct experience with the founders:  \\"Young guys who made their first 100 million on their own ideas are not really interested in 'not invented here.'\\"  That's a real shame.

I end the book with a small diagram that is NOT in the book, it is my own intellectual property, but it is a useful means of evaluating why Google is not as good as it could be.

I asked a very smart person why Google does not play well with others and is so slow to reach out (see the two images I have loaded to the book on Wikinomics) and he had a direct answer based on direct experience with the founders:  \\"Young guys who made their first 100 million on their own ideas are not really interested in 'not invented here.'\\"  That's a real shame.

0930289234|5.0|I came to this novel after watching \\"V for vendetta\\"<br /><br />(also based on a novel by Alan Moore).

While, judged on<br /><br />its on merrits, I prefer the artwork of people like Moebius,<br /><br />I found that \\"Watchmen\\" really worked as a graphic novel.<br /><br />The multiple layers in the plot, as well as the<br /><br />subtext, were equally carried by the art and the text.<br /><br />Along with \\"Jimmy Corrigan\\", this novel convinced me that<br /><br />graphic novels have gone far beyond children's entertainment<br /><br />(they can still serve as great escapist literature, as<br /><br />\\"The Incal\\" will confirm).

0330412744|3.0|Reading Cosmopolis is a rather disjointed, but not entirely unenjoyable experience. Often, it's difficult to follow what's happening in the story, if there is a story, and ultimately, what the conclusion of the story is.<br /><br />This is the fourth work of Don DeLillo that I've read, and it seems that this is his typical style. It's clear that he's a very accomplished writer through his sentence structure and the flow of his paragraphs, but as far as character development... forget about it.<br /><br />The lead character in this book, an investment banker or money changer of some kind named Eric Packer, starts out the book depressed and wanting a haircut. As he rides through the city in his limo, stopping to visit his wife and mistresses several times throughout, he becomes more and more disconcerted with his place in the world. He's constantly on the watch for an assassin, consulting with his team of bodyguards often.<br /><br />The events that unfold in the pages of Cosmopolis are hard to recount. Maybe because they don't really make sense. Is this a surrealist (sometimes metaphorical) account of the crumbling of a banking tycoon, or is the lead character's mind simply so far gone that this is how he sees the world?<br /><br />There's some interesting philosophical dialogue between characters, and perhaps some stunning suggested imagery, but overall this entire book seems remarkably uninspired and flat. Amidst all the technology and philosophy discussions, nothing seems to be happening. In the heightened reality that DeLillo has created, you would think the events taking place would be more exciting.<br /><br />Although I didn't necessarily dislike this book, I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. It's just a mediocre story disguised with clever, sometimes almost pretentious writing.

B000JLTRKE|2.0|..., but not necassarily because Oliver Stone has done a bad job here. In my opinion of all the tragedies and events behind the WTC the one we are served here is being less about the WTC. Please, don't get me wrong. This is also something that deserves being told, the story of those who survived in the ruins, but it was like watching a movie start out with the ending. I spend the first hour of the movie feeling confused. Not because I wanted to see the explotions, great effects. But I wanted a story. To be showed something I hadn't already seen. to be led through that horrible day minute by minute. I have seen documentaries on the Discovery-channel more gripping than \\"World Trade Center\\". Though perhaps it has its' moments at the end, but with a less brilliant director the movie might had been overflowed in sentimentality.  <br /> <br />I recommend \\"United 91\\" instead of this. So much more realistic, and answered so many questions. And gave such an believable version of what happened on that plane.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />In the same lane as Batman Begins, where a franchise that has sucked starts prequeling to rejuvenate itself, I didn't expect much from Casino Royale but a rolicking action flick not really worth much more than an action flick.<br /><br />Casino Royale blew me away, and I think it is the greatest Bond movie since the likes of Goldeneye, Goldfinger, Moonraker, Dr No, etc.<br /><br />The best thing about this Bond that I loved, was that Bond was HUMAN.  As opposed to the super sophisticated suave man with only two emotional settings---uptightly angry and erotically romantic---or as M so elegantly labeled him in Goldeneye \\"...a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War, who's boyish charms, though wasted on me, obviously appealed to the young lady I sent out to evaluate you.\\"  This Bond was HUMAN.  He got very angry, and lost his temper, and as a result failed his mission and nearly lost his job.  He fell in love, and quit his job to stay with the girl.  He comforted the girl when she freaked out at seeing him kill two men.  He cried when the girl died.  He was smug when the man he was chasing finally got his due.<br /><br />Daniel Craig isn't the most good-looking Bond (he's quite grotesquely rugged in my opinion), but he strikes a perfect balance between rough-and-tumble and suave and sophisticated.  He's much more sophisticated from the old one-dimensional Bond we've seen in the likes of Die Another Day.  Even the villain, Le Chiffre, has more depth than just \\"Before I kill you, Meestur Bond, I will tell you exactly how I plan on executing my evil plan...\\"<br /><br />Le Chiffre's diabolical schemes go beyond the typical \\"hold someone hostage, make lots of money, take over the world\\".  This time, the villain is in trouble: he's been taking African warlords' money and holding on to it and using it in gambling, and stock market investings against a prototype airplane's success.  He even hires a man to make sure the plane fails by planting an explosive on it.  After Bond foils this plot, he's in big trouble, and stakes it all on a high-stakes Texas Hold-em poker game at Casino Royale.  Imagine seeing Bond's top villain fearing for his life as African agents threaten to cut his girlfriend's arm off if he doesn't get them their money.<br /><br />While there's plenty of action and violence, including a spellbinding scene in Africa with Bond chasing an African agent through a construction site, hundreds of feet in the air atop a crane, and into an embassy building, the core of the drama actually resides in the great poker game at Casino Royale.  If Bond wins, he wins 150 million dollars and foils the Le Chiffre's plans.  If he loses, his 10 to 15 million dollar investment goes to help fund terrorism.<br /><br />The dialogue is surprisingly ripe as opposed to the endless string of stale and childish sexual innuendos polluting the last movie's dialogue, and there are plenty of witty lines (\\"That last hand... nearly killed me\\" after having to leave the poker game when Le Chiffre poisons his drink, or \\"Do I look like I give a damn?\\" when asked if he'd like his martini shaken or stirred.)<br /><br />While there's a confusing moment where Bond is betrayed by his contact at Casino Royale, Mathis, and then he ends up in a hospital where Mathis is then betrayed, it all makes sense eventually, and the ends are even neatly tied up when the girl Bond's fallen in love with dies and he returns to his work, much colder now, and leaving the door open for some sequels.  While I know this isn't the first movie Bond's fallen in love in (GoldenEye is one I know of), this is the first one where you felt the chemistry was there.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great new beginning for the franchise, and nicely gritty and sophisticated all at once.Bond foils this plot, he's in big trouble, and stakes it all on a high-stakes Texas Hold-em poker game at Casino Royale.

B000LC55F2|3.0|The Prestige is dark look at two turn of the century magicians, obsessed with taking revenge on each other. Jackman's character is convinced Bale's character killed someone close to him, either by accident or through hubris in doing a trick in an unsafe manner, and from there they act like a couple of lunatics going to each other's shows with fake beards on and trying to sabotage or kill the other. If all that sounds a bit hokey, it's because it is, and there are elements of the plot that get even less believable.  <br /> <br />One thing that made The Prestige watchable to me is that it's so hard to figure out what's going on. You are intentionally flipped around through time periods, and trying to figure out some of the mysteries the characters are figuring out becomes engrossing. The other watchable facet is that some actors turn in great performances, stuff far above and beyond what the dopey plot calls for. It's fun to watch Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, and Andy Serkis here, because they for some reason decided to turn in excellently realistic characters. Kudos to them, and too bad they did it in a otherwise throw away film. I'd say the Prestige is a worthy rental, but ultimately the soap opera style final tricks make it vanish out of the audience's minds.

If he survives what lies ahead he just might see the world as it truly is.<br /><br />`Dark City' released in '98 was truly the prototype for the reality bending `Matrix Trilogy' that was to follow one year later. As the film title indicates, this is a very dark film dealing with a subject matter that generally would appeal only to a small and specific viewing audience. It is also a movie that elicits a strong emotional response from the audience at both ends of the spectrum. Whether you like it or not its images and storyline will remain with you for a day or two.

B00005KB9T|5.0|When Bob Marley, Bunny Livingston (Wailer), and Peter McIntosh (Tosh)entered the studio and began recording Catch a Fire in 1972, they had already established an impressive track record on the island of Jamaica. But when they signed to Chris Blackwell's Island label, their music reached a new level. While reggae music had not been tremendously popular at this time, The Wailers proved their style of reggae was strong enough to carry a full-length album.<br /><br />Not only is this album one of the best by Bob Marley and the Wailers, it is one of the best albums in the entire genre of reggae music, and here's why...up to this point, Bob, Peter, and Bunny have never sounded better. Their vocals and harmonies are suberb, their musicianship is just as impressive, and their song writing (Bob's in particular) is passionate (Concrete Jungle), personal (Slave Driver), and seductive (Stir It Up). Blackwell's production and mixing give the songs a crisper, more rock/dub influenced edge that really enhance the original recordings, and he really helped bring out the best in The Wailers. Any way you look at it, this album is a classic and a must-have for fans of reggae music.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|I really like to read the X-men comic books and I loved the X-men cartoon that was on when I was growing up. The first two movies were pretty good even though they didn't follow any of the storylines I know of. For instance Iceman was one of the original X-men and was therefore probably an old man by the time Rogue showed up. The love interest I remember was Gambit, who never even showed up in the movies. That's my first complaint. Gambit is my favorite. (I love to hear that accent.)I'd love to see him in an X-men movie. My second complaint is that most of the good characters end up dead in this movie. I'd list them, but some may not have seen it. Nightcrawler is completely missing from this movie. He's not even mentioned. My biggest complaint if that some of the characters that are introduced are nothing like they should be. Angel was very cocky and sure of himself in the original comic books, but in this movie he's very quiet. I can't remember a single line he had. I think he may have said a few lines when he's father is about the administer the \\"cure.\\" He is also shown very little and for only brief amounts of time. The biggest character disappointment was with Beast. Beast is supposed to be very smart and very witty. I was excited when I heard Kelsey Grammer was playing him because he can be both. But his character wasn't. He wasn't stupid, but he's sopposed to be overly smart with an excellent vocabulary using words most people don't know, but they can get the meaning by what he says. He wasn't very witty. I can't remember any line I laughed about. I believe this movie was a poor ending filled with mainly violence, special effects and poorly developed characters.
0307341542|5.0|This novel was indeed sharp; it had its teeth in me immediately. Rarely do I find a novel where I can both relate to the characters and recoil from their raw brutal emotions. Camille isn't me, but she is the \\"me\\" I could see myself becoming if I had no outlet for my pain. Cutting words into her flesh so she doesn't have to feel or confront reality is hard to imagine, but Gillian Flynn does such an awesome job describing it, I could almost reach down to my own flesh and feel the raised scars.  Two girls are murdered in a small town, and the townsfolk are buzzing with speculation. Is it the older brother? Is it a hitchhiker? What about the mysterious white woman a witness saw, what about the way they were killed? Camille is sent back to investigate for her newspaper, and she ultimately is absorbed into the crimes. Her past is catching up to her, and her family is as dysfunctional as it ever was, if not more. Her sister \\"Amma\\" short for Amity is 13 going on 21. Pigtails at home, miniskirts in public, she reminded me of the little girl in the Bad Seed. Throw in some former classmates, Munchausen by Proxy, and groping in parked cars you get a book you won't be able to put down till you are finished. I didn't expect the ending, and to me that is rare. I look forward to reading more from this author, pick this book up!
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Now that the mask of SAW's killer has joined up with the masks of SCREAM and HALLOWEEN in our collective unconscious, it's maybe time to take an objective glance at James Wan's movie. I haven't had the time yet to see the two sequels but the original SAW is really excellent. Good actors, which is pretty rare in this kind of production, a smart screenplay that should please amateurs of whodunit and serial killers movies as well as hard-edged horror movies fans and not too many references to previous films or disguised borrowings even if the atmosphere of CUBE and SE7EN is tangible in a few scenes. In short, SAW is a movie not to be missed if you're a movie buff.<br /><br />A DVD zone your library

B000BXJ1U6|5.0|This film pokes fun at good old fashioned American College campus antics. Gone are the good old days. Not really, you can relive them in this outrageous film. I love Donald Sutherland's sleepwalk performance as Prof. Dave Jennings. It is a real hoot. Verna Bloom is an unlikely and hilarious seductress. Tim Matheson is a standout and his career has never got the recognition it deserved. Matheson's cool aplomb really makes this film work along with Elmer Bernstein's score doing a somewhat self parody especially on his own swashbuckling THE BUCCANEER score with John Belush's antics during the parade.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|This band would be better if Henry Rollins fronted it. The Zeppelin mocking<br /><br />works musically, but Robert Plant's lyric depth just doesn't suspend<br /><br />disbelief so well these days. \\"Dazed and Confused\\" might have some of the<br /><br />most seemingly meaningless lyrics, if read in print, but the song sure does<br /><br />feel larger-than-life in its overdramatic delivery. That is not quite the<br /><br />case with Wolfmother, but the real irony comes when I begin to compare them<br /><br />to Jack White's Raconteurs or White Stripes projects. For me, every song<br /><br />Jack White conjures up is immediately appetizing, but once I explore any of his<br /><br />albums then I always arrive at the same conclusion, which is that all his<br /><br />textures and arrangements are just as outstanding as they are on his singles,<br /><br />except at the same time revealing limitations in the lyric depth. After I<br /><br />have heard a Jack White song enough times then eventually I grow bored with<br /><br />the lyrics. He simply does not lay out a complex series of images for me to<br /><br />explore. The same goes for Wolfmother, except this is where they also succeed<br /><br />against Jack White, because they at least do a better and more honest overall<br /><br />Zeppelin knock off. Placed against Zeppelin, the sound quality of modern<br /><br />recording is obviously better, even if this band did stock up on every analog<br /><br />stomp box, vintage guitar and effect ever sold. Maybe I just don't think<br /><br />Cream sound funny, being dated. Wolfmother have this odd quality where I want<br /><br />to know how funny this is to them. Are they copying the heydays of acid rock<br /><br />so they can sit up and laugh about it later? Regardless, what this retro ride<br /><br />is missing seems to be more modern context. Since the death of acid rock, we<br /><br />have seen little seedlings of other sub-genres pop up in its wake, and maybe<br /><br />I'm barking up the wrong tree, but I would love some sludge, or stoner rock,<br /><br />or even a little grunge (despite that being a non-real genre). So, in the<br /><br />long run this Wolfmother CD is better than the Raconteurs, but not as good as<br /><br />Queens of the Stone Age or Acid King and no where near as good as the last<br /><br />Open Hand CD \\"Me and You\\" (one of the most underrated gems of all time). I<br /><br />would love to hear some kind of collaboration between Wolfmother and the<br /><br />White Stripes, because in the long run they are both lacking the convincing<br /><br />analog distortion driven passion of a group like Death from Above. All that<br /><br />having been said, I plan to keep both this CD and the Raconteurs, despite my<br /><br />prediction that they will get very few spins with me, because they are not<br /><br />bad albums, just albums with a lot of issues and albums that could have been<br /><br />a lot better, given the talent they suggest.t being a non-real genre).

B00005JPGO|4.0|Blood Diamond is a brilliant and gripping movie and is by far the best film I have seen this year. It's combination of realistic storytelling, spot on acting and all out action scenes is what makes this movie work so well. I must tell you though that this film is definitely not for the faint hearted as a lot of scenes can be quite violent and bloody.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1990's Sierra Leone against the backdrop of a raging civil war and is the story of two men, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) and Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) whom have to work together in order to find a rare pink diamond. While in prison for smuggling, Archer learns that Solomon, who was captured by anti-goverment rebels and forced pan for diamonds, has found and hidden the stone. So with the help of an American journalist named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), the two set off on a dangerous journey into rebel territory to find the diamond.<br /><br />The movie is directed by Ed Zwick whom also directed `The Last Samurai' and `Glory'. I think he has done a brilliant job bringing this movie to the screen because he has managed to convey both the dramatic aspects of the story and the fanatstic action sequences without it leaning to one side. This is what I believe will keep audiences gripped to the end, like it did with me. Another aspect that kept me entertained throughout was the chemistry between the two lead characters and the way that DiCaprio's character `Archer', changes over the course of the film.<br /><br />Overall I think both DiCaprio and Hounsou have done a great job and both deserve oscar's for their performances. Jennifer Conelly didn't have such a major role but she was also good in the film. But mainly I would have to give credit to the writer and director, whom have manged to bring to the screen an intriguing and gripping movie. 9/10
B000K7VHQE|2.0|I'm sorry but I did not fall in love with this movie like I apparently was supposed to. Tailor made for critical acclaim, the \\"quirky\\" little low budget black comedy. Sorry, didn't buy it. I'm glad to see other people here that saw the obvious parrallels between some major points in this plot and National Lampoon's Vacation. Family on a disastrous road trip with comic relief supplied by-1)Faulty vehicle 2)Ornery elderly relative 3)Death of ornery elderly relative 4)Subsequent need to transport body wrapped in sheet for comic relief 5)The race to get to the final destination with the clock ticking.  <br />I also didn't feel a lot of chemisty with the actors. Didn't feel like they were a real family. As for the characters, a little contrived folks come on. The sullen teenage son (seen it), the precocious little girl, of course the ornery old-timer (though Alan Arkin is one thing I did like, mainly because he is a pro) the marriage turmoil and then the troubled gay brother. How about where he just HAPPENS to run into the old flame at the random truck stop buying the porn. Ahh, do the laughs ever stop? Absurd, I thought this was supposed to be a gritty, believable little black comedy. After movies like Rushmore came out there have been a lot of these black comedies where there are depressed white people dealing with all of their problems with group therapy-type dialogue.
B000EHSVS2|4.0|Millions must have been spent in the making of this long and epic movie. It has all the ingredients of an epic the likes of 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Ben-Hur' but it lacks one essential thing: a talented director. Why?<br /><br />There is no emotion, no intensity, no thrill, no excitement at all. If it wasn't for the sheer interest of the personage in question -a true great American- it would be unbearable. But it's viewable, and at times, even entertaining. It deserves than 3 1/2 stars, no more.<br /><br />Now, the added value of this special edition comes in the extras: plenty of interesting and valuable documentaries about Patton and the film itself. Highly recommended for its educational value.<br /><br />It must be mentioned, however, that George C. Scott did an excellent job in this film, and that he's the one that keeps the show going. Excellent interpretation. What a pity the movie just didn't work out as it should have. Coppola should have been directing instead (besides writing the script); but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

B00004ZDVQ|3.0|Seriously, each studio album from Music of My Mind to Hotter Than July's a classic, and this collection, while a serviceable roundup of them, misses out on quite a few good songs. What missed the boat, you ask? Love Having You Around and Evil (from Music of My Mind), Big Brother, You & I and Blame it On the Sun (from Talking Book), Golden Lady, Too High and He's Misstra Know-It-All (from Innervisions), Smile Please, Heaven is Ten Zillion Light Years Away and They Won't Go When I Go (from Fullingness' First Finale), Pasttime Paradise, Knocks Me Off My Feet, As, Another Star and Ebony Eyes (from Songs in the Key of Life - only three songs from a classic double-album is NOT a good idea), and All I Do, Lately (a total classic) and Happy Birthday from Hotter Than July. Still, you get most the classic hits (pretty much the whole album), there isn't a single weak track on the listing, in fact not even anything remotely questionable, and the new songs are all awesome - wrenching ballad Ribbon in the Sky, with an amazing melody; the infinitely funky That Girl, war protest Front Line and especially the joyous, ten-minute big-band stomper Do I Do, with a Mr. Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet - Stevie's improvised vocals over the last couple minutes are hilarious, too. So you can't go wrong with Musiquarium, and it's certainly a fine place to start for those who are looking for an accessible jumping-off point, but don't stop here.
0743455967|5.0|I don't usually like non-fiction at all, not even books on writing.  Yet I loved this book, and have gone back to it many times for reference, and even just to read and enjoy.  One of the qualities that make King's fiction so enjoyable, his personable tone, is present in abundance in \\"On Writing.\\"  It flows easily along, and he gets the reader involved in his book early on, so that even when it's time to talk shop, it's hard to be bored.   <br /> <br />The book raises many good points about writing, and I feel it would be a valuable tool for anyone who wants to improve their skills.  It also gives some interesting points on becoming a published author that, to me at least, make a great deal of sense. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd say this book is a must-read for anyone who likes to write, for pleasure, profit, or both.
074356619X|1.0|This DVD is disturbing. <br />While there were a few scenes that reminded me of me, I found the overall message to be false. <br />This DVD outright teaches that God is the same thing as the universe; that God is actually anything you want him to be.  In fact, the DVD tells people to think of the universe as a \\"genie\\" and you can just make a wish and believe, and you will eventually get your wish!  It even tells people that you can substitute that energy/universe/genie for God if that is how you choose to think about it. <br />Whoa! Wait a minute here. <br />I am not about to buy into a \\"feel good\\" line that runs contrary to the truth.  <br />I am not that empty nor desparate. <br />
B000KCHZK6|2.0|Her former producer Arif Mardin has passed and she did this with her boyfriend on her own for goodness sakes she is a grammy winner and should have hired someone big to help. I'm a fan of Nora Jones, loved her first album, liked her second but this album is dull. The first nine songs are dreadful but try to hang in there because it does improve at the end. Once you hear Rosie's Lullaby, Be My Somebody, and Not Too Late you'll remember why you're a fan. I bought four songs from this album so I don't feel cheated just disappointed.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. I consider it Ridley Scotts best costume film ever, even better than Gladiator. It is a rich cinematic experience that will move you to another time and place and entertain you on the way.   What kind of movie is this? This is a historic war epic. If you don't like this kind of movies this is not for you. The movie tries to portray the environments of the period, animate them with some flesh-and-blood characters, showcase their way of life and present historical battles. All this is tied together with a nice story by Ridley Scott. As always his stories are deeply personal but with wide ramifications. You get it all: from the everyday joys and sorrows to world politics. Not a bad treat.   However, this is just a movie. So the historical accuracy is not always satisfactory. But who would like that? That would just make for a boring story. How fun would it be to learn that all marriages were arranged by the parents in those days and that true love was a rarity? Or to have all women thoroughly veiled (including the Chrisitian ones). How about following a peasant in his daily chores in the dirt? Not really appropriate as entertainment. The movie is close enought to the historical facts to be convincing. For history buffs there are books...  The movie is also \\"fair-play\\" given the difficulty of the topic. We are talking about the \\"clash of civilizations\\", Christians against Muslims, ethnic cleansings and age old hatreds. This is the stuff the movie is made of. Explosive stuff given the world politics of our day. Still Ridley Scott manages to walk the line and portray both sides in a fair way. Especially the Muslims are given a respectable treatment. Actually they are the \\"good guys\\" through most of the film.   Some have said that Orlando Bloom falls short of his role. I don't know were this comes from - probably from some arrogant film critic - but you should not listen to it. It is crap. Orlando does a good job and is quite convincing (and it is not his fault that he is good looking). And as for the rest of the cast it is top-notch. With names like Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, Edward Norton, Liam Neeson and David Thewlis the quality of performance is guaranteed. There are also a number of actors with Middle Eastern origin. This gives the film credibility (Remeber the blockbuster TV-serie \\"Rome\\" where almost all the actors were English? Annoying...).  Some people have made a comparison to \\"Gladiator\\" in this regard. However, this is dangerous territory. One should not forget that these two movies and their lead characters are very different. And it doesn't matter that both were directed by Ridley Scott. He intended different things with those two projects. In Gladiator the lead character, Maximus (played by Russell Crowe), is a  successful and self-confident general who falls into disfavour and as a cruel twist of fate is turned into a gladiatior. Eventually he manages to become famous in his new role and reclaims his freedom. His journey is from high up to down below and up again. Similarly the Roman Empire was a pretty cheerful history (no enemies, total dominace, pax romana etc). This combination of factors infuses the whole film with a positive feeling. This makes it easier to swallow. In Kingdom of Heaven the lead character, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom), is a man of constant sorrow and painful dilemas. He starts dirt poor and unhappy only to be given a second chance by a peculiar turn of fate. However, eventually his bad luck catches up with him and he returns to were he started from. His journey is thus from misery to a minutes fame and back to a more lowly existence. Likewise, the medieval kingdoms of the time were quite misearable stories (with constant wars threatening them, frequent ruins, poverty, cultural and technologicall underdevelopment). This combination of factors makes the whole movie a much darker history. Some have trouble with this. However, it is their problem; the movie is great.  Also the movie is cram-packed with thrilling and beautiful battle scenes. You have it all: hand to hand combat, duells, small band warfare, mega army battles, castle sieges, medieval millitary technology in action etc. I almost wanted to learn fencing after having seen it... There is no recent epic movie that even comes close to this full spectrum. The only one I can think of is the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" trilogy. But that is a trilogy and fantasy at that. This is the real thing. It has happened. Pretty much as depicted in the movie.  So, buy this movie and enjoy it. It is a real feast for the eye. But also for the mind. Ridley Scott manages also to touch on the big questions of life - life crisis, love, loyalty, moral, friendship. An undeniable mark of a master director. I really hope he makes a sequel to this fabulous movie. Actually he has built that possibility into the ending of the movie. And both he and the script writer John Mathieson seem very keen on this as they confess on the extra material. Lets hope the movie companies get the hint...
B00005JPO8|5.0|DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.<br /><br />It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.<br /><br />The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended.

B000929AJQ|4.0|I didn't much like it on first listen. I put it aside and accepted I had wasted my time and money---only so many hours to listen to music in a day and this wasn't gonna be it. Well, I changed my mind, a rare occurence. <br />Actually,this is a darn good CD. I still can't listen to track one,it's too bland and repetitive. Everything else is Reznor at a whole new level. <br />The live drum sounds surprised me,and that's good. This CD sounds good on the home system and really good in the truck. Very good listening experience,just give it a shot. <br />I'd buy it again.
B000059PQ2|5.0|INFERNO-I liked this just as much if not more then \\"Susperia\\". I love Dario's supernatural stuff like this and \\"Susperia\\". The story isn't really as hard to follow as everybody says you just have to pay attention(like all his movies). The special effects are awesome and I love the classic Dario Argento lighting thats in EVERY scene and its obviously a cue he took from Mario Bava. Speaking of Mario Bava, he did some of the effects scenes for this movie and they came out great! If you like Susperia you should like this.<br />PHENOMENA-Probably one of Dario's goriest with a hand being stabbed, a classic Dario shot of a head breaking through glass and a decapitation all in the first ten minutes. The acting is great, the score is amazing, the plot is strange and ranks up there as one of my favorites.
B000002JSN|5.0|I agree with all the 5-stars for several reasons. Page and Co. got it so right on this album,even though tracks on this album were from different time periods in their recording career,up to that point.(wikipedia it) <br />Considering Page was in the arms of Morpheus most of the time, and the band was playing catch up while he dozed somewhere in the studio,it's truly amazing that they got this so right. You can taste the guitar tones on this one and I'm glad they didn't have ProTools around to over-correct every little sound. This album still breathes as if it is a living thing,after all the years since release. Every song is a gift to the Zep fan...go buy this monstrous CD!
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam's sixth album \\"Binaural\\" (2000) marks the bands commercial decline. Stalling slightly past Gold (500,000) in sales, \\"Binaural\\" started to see the band audience strip away to its respectively large (and very loyal) core.<br /><br />It's easy to see why \\"Binaural\\" didn't match the sales of Pearl Jam's previous albums. While their sales had been on the decline for years, from ten million of \\"Ten\\" (1991) to one million of \\"No Code\\" (1996) and \\"Yield,\\" (1998) Pearl Jam was still one of the most popular rock bands well into the late 90s, as they were  a brand name and their later 90s work still had a few radio-friendly singles.  \\"Binaural,\\" however, was not exactly a radio-friendly or commercial album. It's not an album that the fickle mainstream would embrace. At the time of the release of \\"Binaural,\\" pseudo-Grunge rockers Creed had taken Pearl Jam's place, churning out recycled, watered-down \\"Ten\\" era slop to a nonchalant mass audience.  The sad truth is, most people aren't going to take the time to get into an arty, ambitious PJ album, when they have Creed's \\"Arms Wide Open\\" to sing along to.<br /><br />Personally, however, I can't look down at anyone for not being able to \\"get\\" this album, as I purchased \\"Binaural\\" the day of its release and it did absolutely nothing for me. I tried listening to it a couple times to try to get into it...and...nothing. Over the years \\"Binaural\\" sat lonely on my shelf, next to every other PJ release, which received far more spins.  I always considered the album a noble effort, not without merit, but just not my \\"cup of tea.\\"<br /><br />The other night I decided to give it another listen, and while it still isn't my favorite album, I've actually grown to appreciate it a little more. \\"Binaural\\" actually kind of takes up where \\"Yield,\\" left off, but explores more terrain and is a little more risky. It's obvious that while going into the studio to record \\"Binaural,\\" the band didn't give a damn about sales or making radio-friendly singles.<br /><br />The hard-rocking \\"Breakerfall\\" actually wouldn't have sounded at all out of place on \\"Yield\\" and makes for a good opener. The equally rocking \\"God's Dice,\\" one of the more radio-friendly songs on the album probably could have been a radio-staple in the 90s and also sounds like a continuation of the meat-and-potatoes, hard-rocking \\"Yield.\\" \\"Evacuation\\" starts out rocking, but its off-beat chorus \\"EVACUATION!  EVACUATION!\\" kind of derails the momentum. Still, it's pretty cool in a strange kind of way. The sensitive and melancholy \\"Light Years\\" follows next, leading into the album's highlight \\"Nothing as it Seems.\\" Atmospheric and haunting, \\"Nothing as it Seems\\" leaves a lasting impression, as Eddie Vedder's signature baritone growl and Mike McCready and Stone Gossard's spacey riffs and solos take hold of the listener. The bitter-sweet, stripped-down, semi-acoustic \\"Thin Air,\\" with its rich chorus and gentle soloing is another underrated gem. \\"Insignificance,\\" sort of flows along, under-pressure, until its melodic release sets the listener free. The George Harrison/Indian flavored \\"Off the Girl\\" throws the listener an interesting curve-ball.  With its World-Beats, it sounds like it could have possibly fit on \\"No Code.\\" The okay-but-not-great rocker \\"Grievance\\" is one of the album's weaker cuts. The intriguing \\"Rival,\\" kind of has a cool Stonesy-sway. The light piano works as a nice touch. The spacey, off-beat \\"Sleight of Hand\\" throws the listener for a loop, but works. The parable about greed and loneliness \\"Soon Forget\\" adds an interesting touch. The closing \\"Parting Ways\\" reminds me a bit of \\"Release,\\" the closing song from \\"Ten.\\" The viola and cello work very nicely with this song.<br /><br />Some doofus from Creed once said, around 2000 that Pearl Jam (paraphrasing) \\"don't write songs with hooks anymore.\\" And in a way he was right. Very few songs on \\"Binaural\\" are particularly radio-friendly. That said, this album isn't so avant-garde or abstract that it's impossible to listen to. \\"Binaural\\" is a cool album, it just takes a little patience to get into and requires (at least for me) a few spins. There is certain somberness, a certain morose feel to this album, that isn't too overbearing, that I find very appealing in this CD. Gossard and McCready offer a lot of cool solos, which should be of interest to those who complain that there aren't any guitar-gods anymore. Bassist Jeff Ament and new drummer (and still current) Matt Cameron (formally of Soundgarden) provide an unpredictable and exciting rhythm section.<br /><br />If \\"Binaural\\" is sitting on your shelf unused, try giving it another spin. Or, if you missed it the first time around, try checking it out. While it's not their best album, it's still worthy of the Pearl Jam name and remains underappreciated.. \\"Binaural\\" is a cool album, it just takes a little patience to get into and requires (at least for me) a few spins.

B00000JNO2|4.0|This CD, and Nuthin' Fancy, show that good 'ol Shorty Medlocke influence with the diverse,but very southern music songwriting. Bullets is a must have if you are a Ronnie Van Zant fan first,the Skynyrd band second. This is \\"gone fishin\\" and sitting on the porch music at it's finest. <br />If you are a new Skynyrd fan,get One More From The Road,Pronounced and then Street Survivors. Also consider Gold and Platinum and the boxed set,if you want a major portion of the whole pie. <br />Enjoy .
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Dario Marianelli evokes the images of the late 1700's with incredible style and grace.Not only does his scoring,brilliantly performed by the world class pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and the English Chamber Orchestra propel the film along,but more importantly the soundtrack stands on it's own as  an extremely enjoyable and relaxing 45 minutes of very pleasurable listening.While other period piece soundtracks borrow music from the time in order to fill in the score,Marianelli has penned such deliciously memorable country dances like \\"Meryton Townhall\\" and \\"Another Dance\\" that are worthy to have been included in any \\"Dancing Master's Book\\" of the period.FIRST RATE.TOP NOTCH.GET IT!!!
B000001DQI|5.0|I still have the inside gatefold with lyrics and pics on a wall inside my home recording studio,which my cool parents bought in 1973. This tour was my very first concert, at age 11,and was in August '73. I was heavily into \\"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\\", and this really tripped me out as a kid. I was JUST learning to read well, and Bernie Taupin turned me onto a whole new appreciation for words with his work on this album. Elton is phenomenal,of course...a true master at work. What really strikes me about every single song is how perfect his band was. Dee Murray,Nigel Olson, and guitar wizard Davey Johnstone are impeccable. I place this in my Top Ten list, not just for listening pleasure,but as a musician,this CD teaches more about rock and roll than you'll ever learn from except,well....maybe The Beatles. Yeah,it IS mostly pop, but this is some rockin' pop. Learn the guitar licks on this and you'll be The Man! <br />This remastered version is excellent and I recommend it to anyone and everyone, no matter what their main musical taste is. It's that good. <br />Buy this CD- <br />
B0000648WZ|5.0|<br />     I watched this film when it was originally released theatrically. I remember that the response from the audience was much the same as the response I remember when I saw Robocop (had to sneak in) in the theater: A few people clapped enthusiastically and the rest looked around at each other as if to wonder \\"Is it O.K. to have enjoyed this?....\\"  I, myself just enjoyed the well assembled action and the perfectly timed humor.  A few years later I joined the Army and a few  years after that...Well you know what happened....  I have to say that I appreciate the satirical component of the film much more than I did at the time. At this point most people can appreciate that war is hell ( that cliché' is for real, 100%  unadulterated ,  bone fide , certified, and not-likely-to-change-in-the-near-future, FACT).  Even if one begins righteously, that is with a proper justification, the physical realities of what happens on the battle field are no less horrific. There are tools on the battle field that are there strictly to turn your average teeny-bopper into softball sized chunks of red stuff (I mean that literally).  Verhoeven understands this and does an excellent job of contrasting that reality with the type of fantasy rationalization that is required to (at least successfully) prosecute large scale violence. For me the most poignant moment in the film is when then main characters confront the Bugs for the first time and witness a fellow soldier being ripped to shreds. The female trooper who \\"Joined to have babies...\\" makes an absolutely blood curdling shriek and then turns to run.  The look on the actress's face and the sound of her voice, completely captures the feeling one gets when one is being fired at in anger. Whether one admits it or not. I highly recommend this film. I think it should be required viewing. <br />
B000I5YCCO|5.0|The debut album of Taylor Swift featuring the hits \\"Tim McGraw\\" & \\"Teardrops on my Guitar\\" one of the best Country music singers right now, right up there with Carrie Underwood. It's a great debut album, I'll look forward to the next album by Taylor Swift.
B00003CXA2|5.0|For a long time, Forrest Gump was just 'that movie my parents like.'  I never thought I could get into it.  But one day we watched it at school.  Put simply, I was blown away.  I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of the film didn't interest people.  A guy on at a bus stop tells people about his life.  But it is so much more than that.  Forrest Gump, although long, is never boring.  There is always something, whether it be humorous or heart-breaking, going on.  Out of all the Tom Hanks films I've seen, this one is by far the greatest.  Actually, I'm prepared to say that this is the single greatest performance by an actor I've seen (and I've seen some good ones!). When it's over, you immediately want to watch it again.  It's that good.  If there's one thing I've learned from this movie, it's this:<br /><br />\\"Life is like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you're gonna get.\\"
B0002858YS|5.0|This is an AMAZING album - though it takes a few listens for one or two of the songs to grow on you. The others you will fall in love with immediately!  <br />Best Songs: 'All These Things That I've Done','Mr. Brightside','Jenny Was a Friend of Mine','Smile Like You Mean It','On Top'... <br />I first heard 'Smile Like You Mean It' on the O.C Mix 2 (another excellent album). After that, I just had to seek out the Killers and Hot Fuss. If you only own one album this should be it. <br />Also, if you get the chance to see the Killers live, do! They are great in concert.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|This album is a masterpiece for anyone with both ears open to true beauty. Forget coolness--this ain't necessarily cool music. You may actually be embarrassed to tell others that you like ELO. But that's OK! Close the door, put on your headphones, and enjoy the rich guilty pleasures of A New World Record. <br /> <br />That being said, I was expecting a lot more from the bonus tracks. They're moderately interesting, but mostly amount to little more than the same tracks with the vocals subtracted. Granted, the way these great tunes were arranged is magical, but you can hear that with the vocals anyway. Where are the alternate mixes? <br /> <br />I have my doubts about \\"Surrender\\", the only unreleased track from the album. This sounds like it's been processed quite a bit in the studio; doesn't sound like 1976 to me. Not a standout track anyway. <br /> <br />Sound quality: great. <br /> <br />No home should be complete without it.
B0002EXH54|5.0|this is hands down one of the best thrash metal albums ever made.
030716327X|5.0|I received this book as a gift when my son was born.  We got it out when he was about 6 or 8 months old.  It was his favorite book for a long time!  There was nothing more precious than when he started to take the book to his nose and smell the flowers.  Though the book started to fall apart toward the end, it lasted for as long as it needed to - he was starting to out grow it.  I plan to give the book as a gift at future baby showers, for sure.
B0000640VN|5.0|This was a \\"sleeper\\" and really grew on me. I recommend watching the director's cut, which fleshes out the story and helps one to understand more of the complexities involved. The idea of time travel is fascinating, and seeing Hugh Jackman actually clean-shaven is an unexpected bonus. The performances of all of the lead characters were excellent, and their underlying honesty added to the overall feel good experience. The first deleted scene is worth seeing, also.
B00005JOCU|5.0|I really enjoyed Dreamgirls. The plot was good, the acting was great and the music was excellent. It makes you feel the excitement from the beginning of the movie until the end. It gave me chills to hear Jennifer Hudson's heartfelt solo \\"And I'm Telling You\\". The way she sung that song brought tears to my eyes. The audience applauded her performance as if she was live performing just for us. The actors and actresses of this film did a great job. I could actually feel every emotion that was portrayed in this film. It has now become my favorite. It is a more powerful and updated version of the broadway musical. If you like the movie Sparkle you'll love this film even more. I makes you laugh, cry and want to get up and move! Amazing cast... amazing Jennifer Hudson!!! What a way to step out into Hollywood.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I own both versions of this story and love both of them. However, if I had to choose between them, this would be the one I'd pick. The interplay between Elizabeth and Darcy is breathtakingly intense from their first glances and their inner struggles are shown clearly on their faces, unlike the greater restraint shown in the longer BBC version. The whole thing is much more cinematic than the latter, also, and the ballroom scene where everyone but Elizabeth and Darcy disappears for a moment is but one of many masterful touches throughout the movie. It does not follow the book as well as the BBC version does, but somehow it fleshes it out and redeems it for the 21st Century. Excellent in every respect except that I can't seem to get enough of watching it! :-)
1582701709|1.0|write a book, get it marketed well, get on a lot of talkshows that have/want a big audience, persuade the inexperienced/unknowledgeable that there is some \\"magic\\" to winning the game of life, sell tapes and CDs, so that you can stop doing the hard, real, productive work that you used to do to make an average income and you will have discovered that same \\"secret\\" that the carlton sheets and robert kiyosaki's have discovered.  Don't do any work anymore, instead, sell books, tapes and seminars to teach other people how to do what you are no longer doing because it is really hard and involves lots of risk and besides, my success in that area was average and if I could really figure out how to be a fantastic success at real estate or \\"life\\", why would I tell you how to compete with me?  Now, if the author simply told people how to write a book for the self-help market then she'd be honest.  Or to put it another way, the old adage is \\"serve the masses, live with the classes...\\"
B000F0UUT6|4.0|I own both versions of this movie, and love them both. However, if I could only have one, I'd choose the one with Keira Knightley for a couple of reasons. This version is not as visually pleasing and the emotions of the actors are not as visible on their faces. Mrs. Bennett grates horribly in this version, while in the other version, she is pardonable because of her obvious warmth toward her family. I do enjoy watching Colin Firth in this one, and Mr. Collins is superbly smarmy, more so than in the other version. One can really empathize with Elizabeth's repulsion toward his proposal to her. I do like the fact that this version ends with an actual wedding, which is implied in the other version. However, I don't often have 5 hours available to watch it from beginning to end, which loses some of the momentum when trying to see it repeatedly.
B0002S947K|5.0|I was nervous about this one when I ordered it because it came up as an Amazon suggestion.  I read all of the reviews and listened to as much of it as I could, and then I HAD to order it.  I am not sorry that I did.  I love every single song on it and listen to it over and over again.  I put this on every morning while I cook breakfast and every night when I cook dinner....I can't get enough of it.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I have become quite a Jane Austen fan and was interested in seeing this after it was referred to in the movie, \\"The Lake House.\\" I think this is a good film overall, but I had to turn on the subtitles in order to catch all of the dialog, particularly when Anne is reading the letter she gets from her beloved toward the end. The voiceover technique kept me from understanding the letter without the subtitles. This is a very slow-paced story, and Amanda Root's performance was too subdued for my tastes, especially at the end when it would have been nice if her love didn't translate to just a wide-eyed stare, Somehow the glow never made it to her face. I still like to watch it over and over again, simply because I like anything Austen these days. However, of all of the movie adaptations, I would rate the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice at the very top of the list, followed very closely by Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, which is all the more remarkable when you compare it with the book.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Things like this don't happen often.  In fact, this may be the first time a director who got screwed out of his film finally gets to release it...most of it anyhow.  Alot of us grew up with Superman 2 and probably know it like the back of our hands, which makes watching Donner's version a real trip.  Watching this version you wonder why the hell half of these scenes weren't used.  They are pretty damned important if you ask me.  Certain scenes answer questions you've been asking over the years, as far as continuity are concerned.  This version's more directly linked to the first film, making it almost seem like one long movie instead of two separate ones.  Yeah, alot of the slapsticky stuff is gone, but the film doesn't lose it's sense of humor.  As long as they keep in the scene where Reeve confronts the jerk truck driver in the diner and says, \\"this order's to go\\" before pushing him down the counter, I'm happy.  Donner seems to want a more emotional approach.  In fact, Reeve does some excellent and emotional acting here which we never saw before.  The whole scene in Paris is gone, and I'm not crying coz I always felt that to be the low and boring part of the movie anyway.  I'm not gonna dump on Lester's version however.  Many reviewers, after viewing this version seem to have launched an all out attack against Lester now, but come on.  We all grew up with it and we all loved it.  Lets not get snooty.  I find this version far superior myself, but I can't disregard all those enjoyable viewings of Lester's movie throughout the years.  Any fan of these movies will see this film without the help of a review, but I can't suggest enough that you see it for yourself and be the judge of which version you prefer.  Just be thankful we at least have this version now.  Donner certainly deserved it after all this time.
1582701709|3.0|I enjoyed the book ,for its inspiration, and its feel good la.. la.. land mentality it gives the reader. Its a fun read as long as you don't take it so seriously.
0312330871|2.0|Admittedly, I am not a big fan of the mystery genre, but I do read them from time to time.  This book was my first foray into Christie, and will almost certainly be my last.<br /><br />This book was highly recommended by a friend who, up until now, has been right on the mark in terms of suggested reading.  I mentioned to him that I preferred mysteries where there are enough clues throughout that the reader can try to figure out who the murderer is on his or her own.  My friend warned me that Christie is decidedly not like that; in fact, I think his wording was \\"she cheats: she'll introduce a crucial clue in the last few pages that the characters should have known all along.\\"  However, he said that if I can get past that -- and I can -- the total was greater than the sum of the parts in that all other aspects of her books made up for this subjective stumbling point. With that, he told me her best book was \\"And Then There Were None,\\" so I checked it out.  Like I said, this is the first bad call I've seen him make.<br /><br />At no point did this book actually pique my interest, let alone hold it. Characters began dying, and I couldn't care less about them one way or another. The fact that the title tells you the book's pattern didn't help. Less than half way through, I was consciously aware that I was reading on just to finish it and get it over with.  That is NOT a good sign.<br /><br />My major complaint, though, is her prose.  Very rushed, dry, sparse in description, and completely unengaging. Stylistically, she makes a number of remedial faux pas, which at first were mildly irritating but became more grating as the book trudged on.  The most egregious example is exclamation mark overkill: the first chapter alone averaged two or three a page. Just from that I would have guessed that this was one of her first books, as her style struck me as amateurish and unpolished, but to my surprise she wrote this well into her career.<br /><br />Obviously, and for reasons currently beyond me, Christie has a large fan base.  I don't doubt they'd say that I'm either missing something or am an unenlightened philistine who \\"doesn't get it.\\"  However, a prime sign of a *good* book is if a relative outsider like me can come in on it cold and go with it.  That obviously failed here, and I cannot recommend this book, except to Agatha fanboys or someone looking for a sick drinking game -- take a shot every time she uses an exclamation mark.  Be warned if you try that, though: you'll have cirrhosis of the liver 10 pages into it.<br /><br />In all candor, the more I thought about this book, the more it annoyed me - I wouldn't have written such a harsh review otherwise.reasons currently beyond me, Christie has a large fan base.

B00006CXXU|4.0|I think I enjoyed this album from all of Christina's other albums. For some odd reason, and embarrassing as it sounds, \\"The Voice Within\\" was my favorite track on here. That certainly doesn't make me sound all that manly, since the song is about giving a young girl some boost to her self esteem, but the rhythm and lyrics were compelling to me. \\"Beautiful\\" was a radio hit for a long time, and I still enjoy hearing it once in a while. Christina's whole \\"Dirrty\\" image portrayed in this album seems to be more of a hoax than substance, but you can't knock the girl for trying to spice up her image. Even with her attempts at changing her image to a bad girl, she still does her best in the powerful and gripping ballads. Her dance tracks are decent, but if you enjoy her ballads, some of her best are on this album.
B000J103N4|4.0|David Crosby's \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\" is an excellent, five star album featuring a number of wonderful guests. It is superb and deserves much more recognition that it gets. You can read the other reviews here or on the page of the original album release to hear more about that. What I'm not happy about is getting only ONE bonus track with the remaster. I've heard over a complete CD of different versions and different songs out there from these sessions. Why not release a 2 CD Legacy Edition with that material? They surely have access to it. This is a disappointing move by the label and I can only assume was done so as to not impede sales of the David Crosby box set \\"Voyage\\" released at the same time (which is excellent, by the way). When will we see these extra tracks officially released?
0307237699|5.0|Obama has such a vast knowledge about our countries strengths and how we can solve our current difficult situations.  This book is great at describing the true pressures that politicians face today.  I highly recommend it!
B0000714B5|1.0|I purchased this film to show my high school students who just finished reading the novel.  Since they really got into the novel and its overall significance for their own lives, I thought showing the related film would be a good idea.  However, I was so very disappointed in this film and its negligent portrayal of the journey of Siddhartha.  I'm not even sure I want to show it to them now!  The film does very little to capture the symbolism and depth of character found in the novel.  The acting, dialogue, and events seem as dry as a story-board with no color.  Many of the most profound moments in the novel are omitted, while other moments are altered to make them almost laughable.  A film that captures the beauty and true nature of the novel is long overdue.  This film appears dated (and I don't mean Gautama Buddha dated) and the acting and character portrayals are VERY 1972.  Don't get me wrong, the film may have been \\"remarkable\\" for its time, but it would be nice to see a film-maker attempt to capture the true essence of Siddhartha and his life-journey.  Besides, a few special effects when Govinda sees the faces of all living things in the image of Siddhartha would be pretty cool!
B000002KDG|5.0|My wife and I were in the garage not too long ago and \\"we\\" decided that we would thin out my CD collection...actually, my wife decided and I just did the customary head nod, \\"Yes, dear...whatever you say, dear...\\" So she was going through it at breakneck speed and the \\"toss out\\" pile was growing increasingly larger than \\"keep\\" pile. I think I broke out of whatever hypnotic trance I was in when I saw her carelessly toss Neil Young's classic, Rust Never Sleeps in the discard pile.<br /><br />\\"Hey, whaddaya think you're doing?\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, John, for God's sakes it's only Neil Young...\\"<br /><br />The hackles on my neck immediately began to raise and my face got three shades redder, \\"Only Neil Young? I will have you know that this particular CD is a classic.\\"<br /><br />\\"Classic garbage...\\"<br /><br />I grabbed the CD out of her hand and ripped out the Best of Abba (my wife's idea of classic music) out of the boom box and put this baby in. She sat there patiently listening to all the songs and after it was over all she could say was, \\"He's quite a whiner, isn't he?\\"<br /><br />I took the CD out of the player and went inside and like a sulky teenager went in my room and put it in my CD player in the bedroom and put my headphones on and put on Hey Hey, My My on repeat and just let the King of the Fuzz guitar take me to deeper and deeper levels. Neil Young was crunching cords and distorting notes long before Nirvanna, Pearl Jam, or any other \\"grunge\\" group came on the scene. Neil Young needs his backup band Crazy Horse just like Crazy Horse needs him.<br /><br />After the 12th listen my wife gently knocked on the bedroom door. \\"I want to apologize to you, John. I really didn't think you liked Neil Young that much. As a truce I made you a banana split.\\"<br /><br />I accepted the apology, the banana split and I got to keep my CD, but the next day I went looking for my Blue Oyster Cult CDs only to find out that they got tossed along with my favorite Hawaiin shirt...<br /><br />Does anyone know of a good divorce lawyer?
B00003CX96|5.0|\\"Breaking Away\\" is a true rarity: a feel-good movie that doesn't that isn't silly. Yes, there are plenty of laughs in it, but they're the result of great acting and writing, not the cheap, crude one-liners that litter so many of today's so-called \\"comedies.\\" And while the movie will tug at your heartstrings, it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos.    But I also feel sort of sad whenever I watch \\"Breaking Away.\\" The small-town downtown where the guys hang out is just a fading memory for most Americans. And are there any old swimming holes anymore, like the quarry that the characters visit? Or have they all been paved over, for \\"luxury\\" McMansion subdivisions?    Shut me up! Just watch \\"Breaking Away\\" and enjoy it!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) lives a boring life.  He has no friends or social life.  He works as an auditor for the IRS.  He's so boring that he counts the number of times he brushes his teeth in the morning and the number of steps he takes.<br /><br />All that changes one Wednesday.  When he wakes up that morning, he hears a voice narrating his every action.  Of course, this creeps him out, and his co-workers begin to notice his odd behavior.  But things get even worse on his way home from work when the voice predicts his imminent death.<br /><br />Harold doesn't relish that idea, so he begins to look for help with his problem.  Eventually, he comes in contact with English professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to help him figure out what to do from a literary standpoint.<br /><br />Meanwhile, famed novelist Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is trying to figure out how to end her latest book, DEATH AND TAXES.  She's got everything except how to kill off her main character, Harold Crick.<br /><br />As far as I can remember, I've only seen one other Will Ferrell movie.  Most of the previews look too over the top for my taste.  This one intrigued me, however, so I set aside my prejudices and went to see it.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />To be honest, I expected a funnier movie.  This isn't Ferrell's normal over the top gag fest.  It is funny, and I laughed through most of it.  Just not as often as I thought I would.<br /><br />That's because there's an underlying pathos to the story.  Facing death, Harold realizes that he's never really lived.  This gives him the boldness to go for some things he's always wanted to do and make some friends.  The performances by the entire cast wonderfully walk the balance between the comedy and the more elements of the film.<br /><br />Yeah, there were scenes that could have been funnier, but I like the final product.  It's a great mix of comedy and drama that kept me entertained for the full two hours.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me, I think I need to go hang out with my friends.Now if you'll excuse me, I think I need to go hang out with my friends.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I was a moderate Porcupine Tree fan until seeing this DVD at a friends house.  The band is absolutely amazing and you can tell that they're really passionate about their music. <br /> <br />Additionally their musical skill is extremely high and they put on a great show.  I've started increasing my depth of their collection and I'm very glad that I got to see this show.
B000J103OI|2.0|First of all, I hate the comment \\"chick flick\\".  NO matter how good or bad a film is, it's always called a chick flick, if one or 2 women are in it, even if most of the characters are guys such as Jerry McGuire which is a film about a football!  This movie was total fantasy, but not nearly as good as SITC, because the plot was empty.  Meryl Streep makes an otherwise silly movie even though she's a villain and you can't stand her. Don't you just love it when she throws her coat and handbag all around for others to pick up after her. Insane.  Never seen any boss do that before. And if they did, I'd quit. One time I worked for an attorney who yelled at me in front of everybody.  I told him off in front of everybody, and quit on the spot.  Anyway, the way she talks soooo under her breath, and treats everybody as if they were invisible toads made her too one dimensional.  The cast was adequate, and all and all it tried to be an entertaining film, but it had no real plot.  Just a bunch of idiots dressing up in clothes to show off, that few people could pull off, unless they were models. Few people are.    Little bit of Sex and the City flashbacks when Carrie went to work for Vogue and had a similar boss with Candice Bergen but Streep played the fashion queen much tougher and snobbish than Bergen.  Anyway, as mean as Streep played it, let's face it, she's made some damn good films. Meryl Streep can be anybody, but let's face it, she'll never be better than the \\"Choice\\" she made in \\"Sophie.\\"
B000N4SHPS|4.0|When Rocky Balboa signs off this movie with the line \\"Adrian we did it\\" the audience finally feels the closure also, like this was a real person.  This is the allure of why the Rocky Balboa character till this day  maintains its popularity. He is someone whom represents all that is good in the human condition, someone willing to fight for what they want no matter the cost, treat others with repect and teach his successes and failings to others. All in all a real gentlemen, a type of person who is sorely missed in todays money driven and shallow society.  This film is essentially a drama about getting old with a small amount of boxing thrown in to send the old fella off in style. Even the most jaded viewer would find it hard not be the inspired by this old fashioned tale. Proof that even at 60 Sly still has a great ability to write and perform great characters. I have heard this film criticised for its mawkishness however the sentiments of this film are truely heartfelt and honest. This film is recommended for people of all ages and sexes and regardless of whether or not they have seen the entire Rocky series of films or enjoy boxing. This is a moving and uplifting tale that should have received more recognition then simply being dismissed as \\"just another Rocky\\". The ending might surprise you.
B000HEWEE4|1.0|I finally turned it off.  It was one of the most boring films I've ever seen.  I usually really like Sandra Bullock  In fact I bought the film because she was in it.  But it was big disappointment.  The sound was poor, so I put on the subtitles.   Though I don't mind fantasy films, this one was a real loser.  No ups and downs, just milk-toast plain all the way through.   The plot was thin and pretty silly, the characters didn't make sense, and neither did the romance.  But that foxy dog.  Him, I liked!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Worthy of the recent Best Picture Academy Award and a wonderful return to form for Martin Scorcese. Well written, rich characters and a strong, interesting plot all supported by terrific performances, particularly from Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio and Vera Farminga (proving herself to be an up and coming actress to watch). Great night in for fans of classy yet gritty cinema.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|I realize that many people enjoyed this movie, but to me it was very lame and highly contrived.  Of course, each family member had to have their own distinct level of wierdness, but are any of them actually believable?  A grandpa who does heroin and swears all the time?  A teenager who hates everyone and yet spends almost a year without talking in order to show discipline (was that the reason?) because he wants to join the armed services?  A little girl who is reserved and full of self doubt, who then strips off her clothes and pretends to grind in front of a room full of people? (As if any of the Miss America contestants she was watching at the beginning of the film would have ever come close to behaving this way) <br /> <br />And what about the situations?  The grandpa death scene and carrying him around in the bus is directly stolen from \\"Vacation\\", while the cop's reaction to porn in the backseat (completely ignoring the lumpy dead body) is absolutely ridiculous.  The problems with the VW is also too obviously thrown in to make the trip even more difficult and \\"hilarious\\".  Oh, so now they have to push it and run in every time they want to drive?  Oh, and now to make it even more \\"funny\\" let's make the horn on the VW continuously honk!  Don't forget to repeat the joke of crashing through gates since the car cannot be stopped!  So lame.  Oh, and by the way, I get the message of the movie and give it one star for that, but the manipulation of characters and situations is annoying.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|The only things you want to know about \\"The Illusionist\\" are these.<br /><br />1. The fun of this movie is the mystery... So don't let anyone give you \\"spoiler\\" information.<br /><br />2. Although like every other movie, the fun of watching is in the suspending of disbelief, it is a movie that you have to pay attention to and think about. Watch it with someone, but no fair guessing out loud.<br /><br />3. My review. This is a very visual film; there is a great feeling of time traveling to the setting of the film. This is a very dark, sad and romantic story that you will want to watch again. This is a very smart and clever film that reaches out and drags you in, and the ending is...<br /><br />I won't tell!
B00008J2PG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and find myself telling everyone to go see it, I would have to rank this as one of my favorite movies, and the best work Greg Peck ever did. It is about a priest in Rome during ww2 who hides allied soldiers, very good acting, and very exciting movie.
B00005JPGO|5.0|\\"Blood Diamond\\" is one of the best movies of the last 10 years, if not even longer. The story is gripping, gruesome, heroic, heartfelt, and grand. The setting in war torn Sierra Leone is all too realistic and the performances are nothing if not top notch. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou play their characters superbly. DiCaprio as the white African mercenary who wants out of the industry, looks and breathes life into the character with a superb linguistic performance and a \\"feel\\" that makes you believe that there's a lot more hidden inside him than what one can see, smell and hear. Hounsou as the good, caring and at times almost desperate father who wants nothing but to save his family caught in the civil war delivers a powerful and honest performance and has a very strong presence in all the scenes he's in.  <br /> <br />  Also director Edward Zwick succeeds in making a fast paced, action packed, yet very emotional and hardbreaking story. Neither too little nor too much is shown. It's just right. Splendid work.  <br /> <br />  The story is also well written and well thought through, so kudos to Charles Leavitt aswell. <br /> <br />  Overall, the movie is great and raises some very valid questions about the exploitation of Africa by the USA and Europe. It treads the same path of \\"entertaining enlightenment\\" as \\"Lord of War\\" and \\"the Mission Song\\" by John Le Carré before it. <br /> <br />   A very good movie indeed.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|Back in 2004, Lion's Gate released an ultra low budget yet very inventive horror film that spawned one of the most profitable horror franchises in the past decade.  The original Saw draws inspiration from older slasher and exploitation films with some great ideas of it's own.  Two, seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell) wake up in chains with a hacksaw between them.  They both are caught in a game weaved by a serial killer called Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who claims to have their families captive.  In the meantime, a desperate cop (Danny Glover) is on the killer's trail, and it's safe to say that no one gets out of this in one piece.  It took me a while to check out Saw, as I'm not very much into what's considered modern horror movies.  However, it was good to see a new age horror film that takes advantage of the genre by offering up gallons of blood and gore to go along with stomach churning set pieces.  If there's anything bad to say about Saw, it's that the acting is very wooden, there's plenty of leaps in logic, and the first is definitely the best.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Saw, it's better than you might think, and definitely worth checking out, particularly for older horror fans missing that bite that the horror films of years gone bye were infamous for.
B00007KWHO|4.0|Yes is joined by an orchestra for their second album, the last for guitarist Peter Banks. The material is a continuation of the style defined by their debut with lots of great gems that typify the trends of the late sixties: cosmic lyrics, jazzy chords, lush harmonies, and a hot rhythm section. \\"Astral Traveller\\" is a great cut that could easily be at home on Stereolab's \\"Emperor Tomato Ketchup\\" cd. \\"Dear Father\\" (like \\"Survival\\" from the first LP) shows how Anderson can skillfully write a song that passes through epic chord and key changes, taking the listener on what feels like a long and pleasant voyage (something the band would expand upon once they worked their way into the Wakeman years). I'm very fond of the first two Yes records. They may not be as individualistic as albums like \\"Fragile\\" or \\"Close To The Edge,\\" but they do a great job of summarizing some of the more interesting (and sometimes contradictory) trends of the late sixties with a gracefulness and logic that only a prog rock band could engineer.
B0000033K2|3.0|As many jazz fans reading this review already know, there are eight albums John Coltrane recorded for Atlantic, 1959-1961:<br /><br />BAGS AND TRANE ( w/ Milt Jackson )<br />GIANT STEPS<br />COLTRANE JAZZ<br />THE AVANT-GARDE ( w/ Don Cherry )<br />MY FAVORITE THINGS<br />COLTRANE PLAYS THE BLUES<br />COLTRANE'S SOUND<br />OLE<br /><br />Given the sheer excellence of these recordings ( \\"Giant Steps\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\" are landmarks ), this reviewer is more than a little sheepish at having to slap a 3 star rating on the \\"Heavyweight Champion\\" box set. Why? Well, it's certainly not due to the music, for I haven't any doubt whatsoever as to either its inherent quality or artistic significance. And obviously, the low rating can't be chalked up to packaging details, which are uniformly tasteful: the hard-cover booklet, more a  \\"mini-book\\", is exemplary and there is a truly spectacular \\"extra\\" ( ingeniously encased in a replica of a reel-to-reel tape box ) in the form of a disc devoted to virtually *all* of the takes ( partial & complete ) of Trane's groundbreaking tune, \\"Giant Steps\\".<br /><br />No, the crux of my complaint resides in what I strongly feel is an aesthetic violation: the fact that this box set, like so many others, arranges all of the music ( including alternate takes ) in strict chronological order. While this approach certainly has merits for extended live recordings or certain unique studio projects ( eg, Art Tatum's mammoth sessions for Norman Granz ),  I find it has little *artistic* ( as opposed to musicological ) justification when applied to a body of work that stands so close to perfection through the arrangement its creator fashioned. Undoubtedly, there are those who truly enjoy fastidious methods of tracing artistic development, but I question whether any other than the most rigorous would be worse off just exploring the albums in their original form with alternate takes placed as appendices at the \\"bottom\\" of each particular work. And in fact, all of the work contained in this box set *is* currently available in just such a format. I highly recommend the prospective buyer think this over prior to making an investment; for those other than collectors who just *have* to have the set for the complete takes/outakes of \\"Giant Steps\\" ( I admit I wouldn't part with it ), the individual album route makes much more sense.fact, all of the work contained in this box set *is* currently available in just such a format.

B00007KWI9|4.0|Though not the \\"classic Yes\\" that everyone knows and loves, this debut demonstrates the rather interesting synthesis that Jon Anderson and Chris Squire were attempting to create with a lot of charm. The mission statement was to be a strong vocal group w/ harmonies AND be a powerful instrumental outfit (a combination that seemed to be absent w/ many of the bands in London at that time). The Beatles & Byrds covers demonstrate the group's influences while augmenting the arrangements with strong instrumental updates. \\"Beyond And Before\\" is a great opener that stands somewhere between the early Who and the Fifth Dimension. \\"Survival\\" has the band sounding a lot like the Association. In all, a great album that came out about 5 years before Yes fans starting scratching their heads asking, \\"what the hell is Jon Anderson singing about?\\"
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I saw this miniseries in October of 2006 while in London and fell in love with it. I even went so far as to contact BBC to find out if and when it was being released in the United States. <br /> <br />The Chemistry between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens (who does Mum Maggie Smith proud) is fabulous. Toby Stephens is rough and beautiful not ugly as Mr. Rochester is always portrayed, but I'm okay with that.   <br /> <br />As someone who hated the newly remade Pride & Prejudice (my favorite book of all time), I was worried about how I would feel about this new version of Jane Eyre. I caught my breath at more than one moment or five during the film and did not want to miss a moment, I mean who seriously vacations in London and stays in their hotel room to watch all of a Jane Eyre miniseries?  ME! I guess I'm going to have to go back and see everything I missed the first time around.  <br /> <br />Another version of Jane Eyre I highly recommend is the version with Ciaran Hines and Samantha Morton.  This is another electric pair on screen.  Catch Ciaran Hines in Persuasion as well.   <br /> <br />While I'm at it I'll mention one of my other favorites...Sense and Sensibility.  Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman...Oh Col. Brandon... <br />
B00007KWHP|5.0|The introduction of keyboardist Rick Wakeman was the final link in the \\"classic Yes\\" band. Suddenly the group's sound becomes infinately more expansive with Wakeman's incredible arsenal of instruments. This album is considerably more moody than \\"The Yes Album,\\" with tight, aggressive instrumental playing and experimental production techniques. \\"Roundabout,\\" \\"Long Distance Runaround,\\" and \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" would all become staples of the Yes live set (AND FM radio), while the experimental solo tracks put the band far outside the pop mainstream (Wakeman's \\"Cans And Brahms\\" is getting out there into \\"Switched On Bach\\" territory). If you can only afford to buy one Yes album, this is IT.
0307275639|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom is a heart warming book on some of life's most important lessons.  It is a short and easy read. Yet it leaves an aftereffect on us all, reminding us to fully live each day.  Morrie and Mitch are inspiring characters and the book as a whole deserves four stars as a must read that you'll never forget.
B00007LTIA|3.0|I like this album a lot, but that doesn't mean it's a timeless masterpiece. It's not. The departure of drummer Bill Bruford was a huge setback for Yes at this time, and it's not surprising that the first non-Bruford album is less exciting from a rhythm section point of view. The personnel changes almost seem to have produced a more deliberately ethereal recording. I am very intrigued by the idea of longer pieces, classically influenced structuring of themes into a logical composition, and a \\"concept\\" to tie it all together, but this album ultimately fails to continue in the direction of \\"Close To The Edge.\\" By now, the partnership of Howe and Anderson has taken over, and Anderson's quasi-mystical lyrics have become quite stale. This album is impossible to relate to, and while the approach is intriguing, the melodic themes are just not there in the way they are on \\"Close To The Edge.\\" Some great guitar playing here and there, but not enough to sell 4 twenty minute songs. Where \\"Close To The Edge\\" emphasized economy of ideas with longer harmonic changes and appealing themes, \\"Topographic Oceans\\" tends to drone on in a flakey ethereal wasteland filled with mystical lyrics that most people will never understand (much less care about). While I must confess that I'm a bigger fan of Bill Bruford's drumming than Alan White's, I don't want to completely dismiss White's skills. However: the rhythm section is clearly not in control of this album and that's a huge setback. After all, Chris Squire IS one of the two leaders of Yes. A Yes album that puts Squire and drummer in the background is not one of the better Yes albums. I have nothing against long songs. Led Zeppelin's \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is just as epic as this, and easier to relate to. If you've ever eaten hallucinogenic mushrooms, that's what this album feels like: trippy, with the taste of dung in your mouth. I still listen to it a lot, though.
1594200823|4.0|I was glad I read this book and one could split the book into 3 parts.  First corn, corn, and more corn, organic foods, and the how-hum how the author tried to create a meal from local fresh foods. <br /> <br />Corn is a fascinating read into how corn has co-opted humans for its survival. In essence all corn today is a descendent of a plant that if had not been found by man would have died with being able to propagate itself.  Corn today is practically everything we eat from the fructose in our sodas to the corn-fed beef that's in the burger.  Heck even the gas in the car has corn in it.  The spotlight Pollan shines on the darker side of feeding cattle.  I thought any animal parts were banned from cattle feed (a'la mad cow) but no, beef fat is allowed.  Along with bedding from chicken farms (newspapers + chicken poop).  You also learn why e coli is now so prevalent.  Due to acidification of the cows stomach from eating corn (and the aforementioned chicken poop & more) antibiotics and de-acidifiers are fed to the cows.  In this environment e coli thrive, but if fed grass for 3 days prior to slaughter, tada!!!, e coli levels are 75% reduced.  Great idea right?  No, not practical say the beef industry.  I guess a few deaths are ok rather than feed cows what god intended for 3!! days. <br /> <br />Next comes the organic food industry with a focus on Whole Foods and Polyface farm.  I found the Polyface farm to be absolutely fascinating with endless closed loops.  With regards to Whole Foods though I didn't get why Pollan is so negative.  I personally shop there and on Whole Foods he didn't do his homework.  There is a blog between WF's CEO and Pollan on WF's website that goes in-depth.  But he does get quite a few facts wrong.  Personally where are you going to shop if you want organic healthy food?  The major chains are neglected from the Pollan's wrath in this regard.  Maybe in California the local vs. organic is that you can get organic local.  I've tried the buy-a-share organic produce several years ago and ended up being swamped in zucchini's (8+ week for weeks on end).   <br /> <br />Finally Pollan goes on a mission to create a local meal.  He shoots a pig, goes scallop hunting and wild mushroom foraging.  These final 120 pages are a let down compared to the rest of the book but have a few kernels of information that I found interesting.  Nothing like the preceding 300 though. <br /> <br />Overall an extremely interesting book for foodies but he should have got his facts checked first before assuming certain things. <br />
B00007KWHN|4.0|In spite of the rather stupid cover, this album delivers. The introduction of guitarist Steve Howe into the band represents the beginning of the \\"classic Yes\\" lineup.  The band is beginning to move away from their sixties influences and into a more complex, highly textured sound that emphasizes collective arranging. Anderson and Squire still seem to be the primary writers, but Howe's assertive presence immediately pulls the ear into his corner of the group as he seems to stylistically throw everything into the mix including the kitchen sink. Hearing Howe's colorful combination of jazz, rock, country, and classical playing is like reading an encyclopedia of guitar playing. As usual, vocals and harmonies are beautiful, and Bruford plays against the delicate vocals w/ a contrasting punch. Tony Kaye goes out with a bang putting in fine performances before his exit (until the 1980s reunion). If you only want 2-3 Yes albums to get your feet wet, start here, then buy \\"Fragile\\" & \\"Close To The Edge.\\" That will be PLENTY to digest. Great stuff.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|This film comes close to deserving the highest rating of 5 stars, just to balance out those who aren't giving it due credit. It certainly deserves at least my 4 star movie; because a movie that keeps you interested and on your seat, waiting for the next thing to happen deserves that at least. I wonder what it might have been rated if it came out when the \\"Shining\\" came out, because I think the two are fairly equal; different stories of course. The movie did twist at the end; the film went black and I thought maybe the closing credits were going to roll: I won't give it away, but it almost is like there could have been a multiple choice ending to this movie; well done; and at least 4 stars. Maybe for my comfort; I can choose which ending I liked.
0792844882|4.0|Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley) is a beautiful traveling girl who is desperate for a job in Las Vegas.

James (Glen Plummer) is a free-style man helps Nomi as he teaches her the right dance moves to become a top dancer when the rivalery between her and Cristal has begun.<br /><br />Very entertaining sleaze epic from Paul Verhoeven (\\"Total Recall\\", \\"Robocop\\", \\"Basic Instinct\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\") has non-stop nudity, clever dialog, sex and over the top acting. There's plenty of good eye candy through the many gorgeous girls prancing nude especially Ms. Berkley who really shows off her stuff for the camera.<br /><br />The DVD has good picture and sound with a couple of good extras like the trailer and a behind-the-scenes featurette, this is an enjoyable erotic flick if you can suspend your disbelief.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|This movie is SO over-rated.  This movie is pointless and boring.  <br />I swear, every time a movie is 150 minutes, it should ALWAYS be 45 minutes <br />shorter.  There is so much schlock footage, just wasting screen time. <br />Ok, so three different stories about communication problems.  WHO CARES?!?! <br />The movie had no intrigue, intellectual stimulation, or emotional pull.  <br />This movie is flat out dull.  Don't waste your time, I beg of you.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie is so incredible, I don't even know where to start. Robin Williams is great in this movie, it's one of his best performances hands down. Annabella Sciorra is perfect as his tormented wife. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a surprisingly touching and impressive performance as an angel. And who can forget the dalmatian?? The plot is heartbreaking: After losing their kids, Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra are trying to cope when Robin dies trying to save a life. Anabella plunges into deep depression. From heaven, Robin tries desperatley to reach Annabella. She ends her own life and he spends the rest of the movie trying to reach her in hell. Their kids have surprising and delightful roles in his quest. The imagery in this movie is top notch, especially for 1998! Heaven and Hell are depicted so incredibly real, I felt as if that may actually be what they are like. The concept of 'soulmates' takes center stage in this touching melodrama. It's the ultimate love story and tradgedy. Let me warn you- have tissues nearby.
0553565915|4.0|This is a very good book. Most of what is in this book is very inspirational with lots of wisdom. What a do warn though, is in her other books, it gets a little iffy on the info she shares. She is Christian but seems to be a bit new agey as well. So this book is good, but gets into unwaned territory in her other books.<br /><br />This shares about her experience going to heaven which is untypical from other books. She is hungry for knowledge and learns a lot and shares the wisdom. I was impressed. She also shares some of her testimony of her life which is very interesting reading.
0380730405|5.0|Honestly, I wish they'd replace Jane Eyre with this book as required reading in high school. Rebecca is a gothic novel, somewhat reminescent of Jane Eyre yet far more interesting. The nameless narrator marries Maxim de Winter in what seems like a fairytale. But upon arrival at his magnificent country home, the narrator detects the ghostly presence of Maxim's deceased first wife. The book starts out a bit slow but quickly picks up the pace. Du Maurier (in my eyes) is the queen of description and suspense. Some of her descriptions of Manderley gave me chills. You feel as if you're right there with the un-named protagonist in the stunning estate that is Manderley. Manderley almost becomes a character in its own right. Du Maurier created characters you both love and hate and almost all characters are hiding something. This book will keep you up late. It's one of my favorite books of all time. Be sure to check out the Hitchcock film of the same name as well.

0060005688|3.0|Unfortunately, I came to this book a bit late.  And even more unfortunately, I read Daniel Gilbert's breezily engaging \\"Stumbling On Happiness\\" before taking this one in.  I say that because - though I found \\"The Paradox of Choice\\" to be a solid and effectively-argued treatise on the very modern problem of consumer inundation - there is an almost-overwhelming amount of overlapping studies from that book to this one.<br /><br />Need proof?  Well, be careful what you wish for!  Because I, obsessive nerd that I am, actually kept track.  The repeated studies are as follows (and please feel free to skip this paragraph if you haven't read \\"Stumbling\\"):  the unpleasant noise/colonoscopy \\"peak end\\" experiment (pp. 49-50, paperback edition); the college student snack-picking survey (p. 51), the 3rd letter/1st letter demonstration of the availability heuristic (page 58); the $100 coin flip risk assessment analysis (p.65); the $20 concert ticket example of \\"sunk costs\\" (pp.70-3); the \\"experience sampling method\\" (p.106); trade offs involving new car options (p.124), the picture choosing study (p.138); the lottery/quadriplegic examples of hedonic temperature on p.170.  And I could go on (really!), but I think I'll spare you (and me) the trouble.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, if you read \\"Stumbling on Happiness,\\" you will find a lot of repeat material here.  And you may find that frustrating, as I sometimes did.  If you're still interested in the ideas (and solutions) presented in this book, I recommend you pick it up in the library and just read chapters 4 and 11, which for all practical purposes can serve as a condensed version of the entire work.<br /><br />But even if you haven't read \\"Stumbling,\\" there's still quite a bit of this book that can be skimmed past without missing too much - especially in the beginning.  In chapters one and two, the author goes a little overboard (perhaps intentionally?) in showing us just how easy it is to drown in the sea of choices that can be made in every facet of life.<br /><br />It all becomes a bit repetitive and recurring and redundant and sometimes makes its points a few too many times over (much like I just did in this very sentence - annoying, isn't it?).  I mean, the \\"jeans story\\" in the prologue is amusing and easy to relate to, but in Part I of the book (\\"When We Choose\\") we have to hear about how many options are involved in (*takes a deep breath*) groceries and gadgets and catalogs and academics and entertainment and utilities and health insurance and retirement plans and medical care and beauty and work and love and worship and identity. (*falls on ground, gasping for air*)<br /><br />I GET it, Barry!  I UNDERSTAND there are too many choices in the world - that's why I bought your gol-danged book!  For the impatient readers out there, I would suggest skipping these chapters entirely (but then again, that would entail you having to make another choice, and I don't want to burden you with yet another one - so forget I mentioned it, okay?)<br /><br />Thankfully, it gets better.  Part II (\\"How We Choose\\") is decidedly more rewarding (save for the repeat studies mentioned above).  On pages 77-8, Schwartz lays out his central construct of \\"maximizers vs. satisficers\\": \\"If you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer...The alternative to maximizing is to be a satificer.  To satisfice is to settle for something that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better.\\"<br /><br />And until the final chapter, the rest of the book (aka Part III: \\"Why We Suffer\\") is spent convincingly (albeit somewhat relentlessly) warning against the energy-draining dangers of \\"maximizing\\" and extolling the virtues of \\"satisficing.\\"  (And, let the record show, it is never explained (in my copy, anyway), where the term \\"satisficing\\" comes from.  I suppose it is an amalgam of \\"satisfy\\" and \\"suffice,\\" but to this reader it seems a little forced, unnecessary and even a bit pretentious - and I usually like dumb wordplay.)<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the ensuing discussions about concepts such as: the wealth/availability of choices in various nations and how it correlates (or doesn't) to happiness; harnessing the power of second order decisions; how to best deal with opportunity costs (according to standard economic assumptions); the confounding qualities inherent in trade-offs; how counterfactuals can be used for the power of good; and the vagaries of such things as \\"inaction inertia\\" and \\"positional goods.\\"<br /><br />(And by the way, if the above list sounds a bit dry to your ears... that's because it is.  The writing in this book exists on the cusp between the conversational and the academic.  It's not quite as engaging or chatty as the prose of other pop-science authors like Leavit or Gladwell or Gilbert, but it's not so dry that you could use it to mop up nasty spills...)<br /><br />Along the way, a collection of not-very-funny half- to full-page New Yorker comic strip panels appear every 25 pages or so and don't do a heck of a lot to spice up the proceedings.  Also, the penultimate chapter on depression seems to come out of nowhere and has little to do with the rest of the book.<br /><br />But the final chapter (found in Part IV: \\"What We Can Do\\") does a nice job of summing up the concepts and suggesting possible coping strategies.  Though I struggled at times with the pace and the tone of this book (perhaps because I was spoiled by \\"Stumbling\\"), I still think there is enough good stuff in here to merit a perusal.d even a bit pretentious - and I usually like dumb wordplay.) <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed the ensuing discussions about concepts such as: the wealth/availability of choices in various nations and how it correlates (or doesn't) to happiness; harnessing the power of second order decisions; how to best deal with opportunity costs (according to standard economic assumptions); the confounding qualities inherent in trade-offs; how counterfactuals can be used for the power of good; and the vagaries of such things as \\"inaction inertia\\" and \\"positional goods.\\" <br /> <br />(And by the way, if the above list sounds a bit dry to your ears... that's because it is.

B000000OUJ|5.0|It actually defies description. From the moment the disc starts spinning to the second it stops, you're taken to another world. This will never be topped in any way, shape or form. The CD cover says it all - it is a battle of epic proportions inside your head. If you don't own this, you've missed out on how good an album can be. Period.
B00005JNQS|4.0|Ok, not entirely, but sorta.<br /><br />First off, this movie was MUCH better than Ice Age...either of them.  Those movies were kinda dumb, with a totally cliched storyline.<br /><br />Robot had beautiful visuals, clever humor, and a cute story line.  Much like Star Wars borrowed from fantasy & folklore stories, Robots also borrowed from the past. Midnihgt Cowboy & Metroplois certainly come to mind as influences.<br /><br />While the story was pretty good, the one thing i would have changed was to have the Mel Brooks character incapacitated by Greg Kinnear, not just emotionally defeated.  That way, instead of the cliched \\"I'm a new man\\" angle, it would be neat to have him simply saved from destruction, then lead the fight with the other Robots against the tyranny of the \\"rich.\\"<br /><br />Otherwise, great movie.  Ice Age?  Please... Pass those up.  I still don't get why people find those funny.
B000002WPI|5.0|What more can you say about an album so miraculous and explosive? This is the real thing. Grimy, gritty, dark, violent - the way the MCs spit their verses - no one's EVER sounded this hungry, before or since. It's like getting a university education on a disc. If you missed this one, you need to repent and buy 2 copies. The gold standard by which all hip-hop albums are now judged.
0618551050|5.0|Lee Smolin is one of the really creative thinkers about physics. He spent a number of years of his life working on string theory. He finally came to the conclusion that it is nonsense. It is not science in that after thirty years, it has made no predictions that can be verified or falsified. Yet, it has been so adopted by the physics departments of almost all US universities that you cannot get tenure unless you believe in it and teach it. This is a powerful indictment of our academic political correctness. I thought that the English and History departments of our universities had been corrupted by PC. Now I see that physics is just as bad. Read this book. It will open your eyes. Then go read some of Lee's other books particularly The Life of the Cosmos and Three Roads to Quantum Gravity. You will learn a lot from a really creative scientist.
B000002WU9|5.0|100% bangin' album. They don't make them like this anymore. See all those positive reviews? There's a reason for them. This is a motion picture on a disc - unbelievable. RZA production is out of this world, and every verse is  a verbal assault. If you don't own this yet, you don't know hip hop. Tracks 6 and 7 still send shivers down my spine, even though I've heard them a bazillion times.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I think most people have agreed by now that Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films ever made.  But why do people think this way?  Let me analyze.  Casino Royale has the best aspects that the old Bond films had; good action sequences, a good opening sequence, a cool car, and, of course, the man himself; James Bond.  Except this movie has more than the old films; it has more emotion to it which makes Bond seem more believable as a character, it doesn't get caught up in gadgets, which is good to a certain point, but I know that's one of the reasons I like Bond films in the first place, and it doesn't have any crappy cliches, which, out of respect to Sean Connery, sounded good coming from him. <br />All of these factors make this film worthy of modern day cinema and make the Bond series worth continuing.  But, then I asked myself, does it?  The original Ian Fleming novels were based on Bond saving the world from a sadistic organization called SPECTRE, featured in most of the Sean Connery films.  The awesomeness of the original Sean Connery movies were based on the original Ian Fleming books with SPECTRE, so naturally, if the Bond series is to be restarted, SPECTRE must play a part.  But, SPECTRE's main purpose was to play off of the cold war and benefit from the quarrels that would break out between the U.S., Britain, and the U.S.S.R.  So I began to think, how can they bring back SPECTRE if there's no cold war? <br />The simple answer to this question is, they can't.  The rules of war in modern society have begun to change so that it's no longer quarrels between superpowers where terrorist organizations can get away with stuff.  Now it's countries fighting terrorists directly, so how can they bring back a terrorist organization who benefited from a conflict that's no longer there? <br />From this conclusion, the future of the Bond series looks somewhat different from the memorable series that I remember watching.  And to clarify, people also think that Daniel Craigbeats any other Bond.  Not that I don't like Daniel Craig as Bond, in fact he's probably the second best Bond there ever was.  But seriously, Sean Connery you guys, Sean Connery.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead made their definitive contribution to rock history with \\"The Bends.\\"  This album captures a guitar rock band at the early peak of their creative powers.  Thom Yorke and co. learned the value of getting pissed off, letting the guitars loose, and just being a straight-up rock band.  They embraced the appeal of cutting actual pop songs, but also left room for just enough innovation to make nearly every song memorable.  On later albums, Thom Yorke would actually become a setback to the band by draping his voice over the music like a wet rag.  Here though, he keeps it melodic and locked into the band's killer hooks and guitar fireworks.   <br /> <br />The best song on \\"The Bends\\" is definitely the title track.  The massive, churning guitars at the start are downright shocking, and Yorke nails his best vocal performance ever on a mid-song crescendo that's pure transcendence.  That combined with '90s-time-capsule lyrics (\\"I wish it was the '60s/ I wish we could be happy/ I wish that something would happen\\") make this the album's most galvanizing moment.  Crank it for anyone who calls Radiohead too \\"mopey\\" or \\"challenging\\" and watch their jaw drop. <br /> <br />A lot of people think \\"Ok Computer\\" is Radiohead's best album.  It's true that it has moments that are just as brilliant (if not more so) as any on \\"The Bends.\\"  But \\"Ok Computer\\" bogs down a lot on said mopeyness and drippy vocals.  For a tighter, more cohesive and just plain better album, look no further than \\"The Bends.\\"  It represents some sort of peak in '90s alternative music, and 12 years later truly deserves classic status.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Well, I must say that now that I am of the age (52) to appreciate all the nuances of this great Sci-fi classic such as plot, acting, cast members, special effects and many other subtleties, Forbidden Planet has renewed my interest in viewing the older sci-fi movies with much enthusiasm.  From the opening sound effects of the simple disc shape spacecraft to the roar of the self generated \\"monster from the ID,\\" Forbidden Planet has it all! Don't expect any slapstick from a young Leslie Neilsen as the lead actor in this flick. He does a superb acting job making a very believable crew leader. Walter Pidgeon as the slightly mad scientist along with Ann Francis as the innocent daughter do an outstanding job as supporting cast. The story of the Krells and their incredible inventions is just fantastic piece of science fiction that supports the entire plot superbly. Oh I'm sorry did I leave out the most important character of the movie? The first appearance of Robby the Robot!!!!!!! Not to mention all the special features! What else can I say? You will love this movie!
B000002UAR|5.0|You mention The Beatles and everyone thinks Sgt. Pepper......well...Sgt. Pepper is nothing compared to Revolver. This Cd and Rubber Soul combined make any other Beatles cd's pale by comparison. The emergence of the psychedelic era starts here. The band is truly comming into it's own and it shows. But enough of this rambling....if you are tired of \\"love me do\\", and you cannot stand another playing of \\"a little help from my friends\\" or \\"let it be\\", check out Revolver and Rubber Soul.
1592401791|5.0|The stories told in this book really show the true artists, and why the Beatles were so successful.  It took me a few months of on and off reading to finish this book, but after completing it, I can honestly say it has changed my view of recording, and what the roles of Engineer, Producer, and Artist really are.  I can't recommend this book enough, just buy it, and you'll love it.  Also, it really helps to get the Beatles catalog and listen to the songs as you read about them.  It really gives you an immersive perspective into those sessions.
B0002EXH4K|3.0|Megadeth's \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" was Megadeth's follow up to the brillent \\"Rust in Peace\\" I figured that topping that album would be difficult, espically since Dave has always been a hard guy to get along with, and Megadeth had already seen some line up changes since the release of 1985's \\"Killing is my Buisness\\" When it was first released, I hated it, thinking that Megadeth was following in Metallica's footsteps of moving out of the boundries of Thrash, and becoming more of just a hard rock, then a Metal band. When I look at in know, there are some great songs on here, such as High Speed Dirt, the Title Track, and Skin O My Teeth, but some of the album falls flat and falls to really grab you like some of the earlier releases. Make no mistake, this is a solid album, yet and I understand that following up a amazing album is difficult, but it doesnt even come close to \\"Rust in Peace\\" and that is a bit of a dissapointment. I believe just like Metallica's \\"Black Album\\", this was made to appeal to more of the masses, and sometimes that can spell doom for some bands. Megadeth wouldn't release another great album until \\"Cryptic Writings\\" and that would be their last moment of greatness. Once again, this is a solid release, but still isnt anything that will really blow you away, and if you are looking for albums that are in the ballpark of \\"Rust in Peace\\" get \\"Peace Sells\\", \\"Cryptic Writings\\" and \\"Killing is my Business\\" before you try this on for size.

B0000DZTIW|4.0|I always love it when composers branch out and write music that you would never expect them to write, yet retaining their own trademark sound. Here, Hans Zimmer utilizes his own, recognizable sound, where you know it's him with eastern instrumentation, such as Taiko drums, the shakuhachi (a staple in Horner scores lately), and the koto harp. It's east meets west, a route in which Tan Dun took on in the film \\"Hero\\", and Zimmer's score follows many of those same musical ideas, only not quite as eastern sounding as Dun's score.  <br />The main theme is a powerful 7-note anthem which tends to build its way up each time, as in \\"A Way of Life\\", \\"Spectres in the Fog\\", \\"Idyll's End\\", and \\"Safe Passage\\". You can tell it is a Zimmer theme just by its sound, but with the oriental flavor thrown in, it really adds to the mix.  <br />The action music in the score is exciting with energetic Taiko drums keeping the pulse moving. They do not get tiresome, as you might think because Zimmer uses them more like a heartbeat, not a heart attack! \\"Red Warrior\\" is a powerful anthem, consisting of japanese warrior chants, which really add to the scope of the sound. Other noteworthy tracks are \\"Ronin\\" and \\"The Way of the Sword\\", which are enjoyable pieces of music.  <br />I was pleased of the results of Zimmer's work here. It showcases Zimmer's diversity with his music. I hope he gets the opportunity to write more diverse scores such as this. The Da Vinci Code is certainly one of them!
B000MCH5P4|2.0|Babel is difficult to watch but thought-provoking.  The acting is superb.  But I was really disturbed by the exploitation of the children in this film.  Did I need to see a 12-year-old boy peeping at his naked sister and then maturbating?  What does that add to the plot?  The deaf-mute Japanese girl--I don't know how old she really is or if she really is deaf, but the film puts her at about 16.  The endless crotch-shots and then the full frontal nudity shocked me--I really felt she was being exploited. The ending, where her father finds her on the balcony, nude, and takes her hand, left my husband wondering if this was supposed to suggest some sort of incestual relationship. Although I don't agree, dad definitely did not seem surprised to find her out there unclothed.  If adults want to do these types of scenes, fine.  But having children do them pushes the envelope on kiddie porn and left me feeling dirty after watching this film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While navigating Amazon, I ended up on this series fortuitously, and was convinced by the raving reviews. Even though I do not particulalry like SF shows or Westerns, I decided to rent it. I was hooked after the first disk, and ended up buying it because I had to have it. Each episode has a nicely developed story, no repetitions, and the characters are all well fleshed out. I honestly cannot figure out why this show was pulled from TV (and I can see I am not alone in wondering...). There are so many unwatchable things out there, and this was clearly a superior product but, then, I hardly ever understand what goes on on TV... Anyway, if you don't know this series yet, I would strongly advise you to get it. Rent it first, if you don't want to commit. I bet you'll end up buying it anyway...

B000LE0THO|4.0|As a kid, Out Of The Blue was one of the first albums (actually, 8-track) I paid for.  That decision was made after hearing \\"Sweet Talking Woman\\" as a single, and after I bought it, the album grew and grew with me.  Every few weeks, a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable.  The first few weeks, it was \\"Sweet Talking Woman,\\" \\"Turn To Stone,\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" (all pop perfection); the next few weeks, it was \\"Wild West Hero,\\" \\"Across The Border,\\" and \\"Jungle.\\"  After three months, there wasn't a corner or edge of the album I didn't know and like.         Thirty years later, the remastered CD finally comes around and, through the fan club at [...](Which I heartily recommend because of their labors of love) I bought this and Balance Of Power (review coming).  I have to say I was a little scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of music have evolved and the label of \\"pretentious\\" has been placed on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker, nonetheless).        A big sigh of relief--the CD holds the same joys it did before.  The Moog synthesizer riff by Jeff Lynne in \\"Turn To Stone\\" still pumps the heart, while \\"Sweet Talking Woman\\" and songs like \\"Wild West Hero\\" and \\"Jungle\\" still delight.  But I'm amazed at how things like the \\"Concerto For A Rainy Day\\" (four songs including \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\"--still the brightest jewel on this album) still hold together, and songs like \\"Stepping Out\\" and \\"Sweet Is the Night\\" step up to dig their hooks into you even today.      While the remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up (\\"Across The Border\\"'s horns beg you to crank them up), there are a few drop outs (\\"Night In The City\\" has a couple), and of course, my tastes probably don't translate to everyone.  But, my 16 years old has given the album a careful listen, and he hasn't returned it to me yet--I imagine for the next few weeks I'll still enjoy listening to \\"Out Of The Blue\\" from downstairs for a few more weeks...
0767836324|5.0|This film warms my heart, makes me laugh, provides some good points for teaching and sermon illustrations.  I am surrounded by people who have forgotten who they are.  Tinkerbell's push to help Peter remember has deeper meaning than perhaps it's meant to have, but it's true nonetheless.
B000G759LW|4.0|When Aguilera is in top form, she is unbeatable and she is in top form for much of this 2 disc set. I absolutely love the cut Candyman, for instance, which reminds me of Bette Midler in her early years, when she was singing in venues populated mostly by gay clientele. Both the song and video are presented in a retro and campy style. Pure fun, pure nostalgia. Superb!<br /><br />  The rest of the songs are varied and very mixed, with a bit of everything thrown in. I especially liked Hurt and Mercy on Me, having a soft spot for songs that are more romantic or torch song style.<br /><br />  The bottom line - is this one worth buying? Absolutely. Will you  like EVERY song? Probably  not. But there is enough here to outshine so many supposedly \\"great\\" artists out there, that you're likely to be pleased with this one...and you can always skip past the songs you don't like.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Pitt did a great job in this movie... I thought Bana did very well, but his brother should have been whacked.
B000LC55F2|4.0|This movie is well worth  watching, not just for fans of magic but for anyone who likes a good, character driven plot line.<br /><br />  Having said that, I caution viewers NOT to watch this if you are brain dead and simply looking for something mildly entertaining to view. This movie deserves full concentration and I found it a bit exhausting at times (but worthwhile).<br /><br />  This is a flawed film (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars) but it does so much SO well that it nearly pulls it off. Both Huge Jackman and Christian Bale are in top form, playing rival magicians, each with a special talents. Bale plays a magician with some spectacular skills but lacking in dramatic performance. Jackman has the drama down pat but isn't as talented a magician and he is obsessed with learning his rival's secrets. Add to that some romance, jealousy, a former friendship between the two magicians and Michael Caine as a superb wise man and observer of the whole situation and you have an excellent film.<br /><br />  Still, there is something lacking, perhaps because the director is relatively new. At times, the film seems to drag and there are a lot of loose ends that don't make sense unless you pay close attention (I actually had to go back, scene by scene, to put it all together after watching it the first time).<br /><br />  Even so, this movie is superior to so much that is out there and the actors do a superb job in delineating the dangers of obsession - as well as the rewards.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Unquestionably the BEST MOVIE ever written. Buy it just for the education then...A man that doesnt spend time with his family can never really be a man.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I went to see this film with no expectations, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was, Edward Norton is an excellent underated actor, & the other actors all good supporting actors. Liked the film alot, maybe considered a chic flick by some, also another good film very similar The Prestige with Hugh Jackman & Scarlet Johanson.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|Great job on the part of Crowe.. Awesome job... a little too much gore in this movie .. but great job.. <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Ever since watching my 1st bond film I have enjoyed the bond films,its a sentimental thing & with the exception of Roger Moore & Timothy Dalton (not very good in my personal opinion). I was cynical about Daniel Craig & was not even interested in watching this bond movie. I am so glad I opened my mind & saw it, awesome stunts, very intense actor,oh & love the Cars as well, more a working class bond like Sean Connery (the old school I don't give a fig attitude)which is very appealing. I look forward to more bond films with Daniel Craig, yes he is hot! yes we all know how the plot will end, but it is still a nice bit of entertainment, I highly recommend seeing this film.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|This movie is slow ... I knew I should have waited for DVD .. but Deniro ( CIA ) I ran to this show like a Bennie Hill to a Buxom Blonde ... oh well ... I am sure watching this at a HOME Theater will be much much better... but dont miss it ..come on..
B00000634J|4.0|Listen to a Beatles song, any Beatles song, and you'll think, \\"It's good, but it's not their best.\\" What is their best song? And the fact is, they never made it. Meanwhile, for much of my life, I thought John Lennon's solo career consisted of three songs and two weren't very good. That is just so wrong. He had an extremely productive career as a solo artist, far more insightful AND more musical than anything he did with the Fab Four. Truly. During our recent Laotian border run, when it got too dark to read, I listened to some John Lennon in my MP3 player that I'd never heard before. Wow. Get this.
B000CQC1HW|5.0|I give this book to my new sales reps and it motivates every one of them. <br /> <br />A great read!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first watched the movie.  And instantly feel in love with the story and the characters.  They are so well thought and played out, you have no choice but to really feel for them.  The actors were a perfect choice, they really brought the characters to life and made you care what was going to happen next.  <br />So I had to go and get the series.  And I just finished watching it last night and I have to say I never enjoyed watching a series so much.  I laughed, I cried, I couldn't help myself. <br />I was done with the same effects and sharp humor as the movie and I don't regret the purchase.  All I want to do now is show the series to everyone I know would appreciate it and let them fall in love with the cast and the story line which I think is so original that it shouldn't have been cancelled so early without being able to get to more people.  I feel upset and frustrated that the series didn't continue and I wish that there was something that could be done about it.
B000M341QE|4.0|This film grew on me as I watched it over a couple of evenings. The first half seemed just fine, but didn't seem that different than fairly good HBO dramas - like the Sopranos or the Wire. It's competently acted and filmed, but there wasn't a whole lot of personality to the filmic language. In a way, it didn't feel like it was an obvious Scorsese film.  <br /> <br />The second half engaged me a lot more, though. Seeing the threads of the characters' fates pulled together was compelling in a \\"can't look away from a car wreck\\" sort of way. I did like how Matt Damon was the amoral center of the whole thing - kinda like the character he played in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Leonardo is solid, and Nicholson is hard to resist. I could see how people would be disappointed with the ending. If you start asking Why? Why this story? Why should we care? What is it teaching or exploring?... Well, maybe it's better not to ask. Just watch the competent filmmaking, the action, the bullets flying and don't ask for too much more. <br /> <br />The contrast between this and such distinct and unusual films as Mean Streets and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver is huge. Back then Scorcese couldn't get the Academy Awards that he deserved - maybe because he was so unique and so Italian. Now, when he's more mainstream - and when his actors are the cream of the Anglo-Irish crop - he gets the recognition. Doesn't seem quite right, but so be it. Scorcese's legacy won't be pegged to this film, but at least he has the Academy Award on his resume now. That's what we'll remember in the future as we watch his classic films.
B000M341QE|5.0|Hollywood has welcomed a lot of great mob films (\\"The Godfather\\" trilogy,\\"Goodfellas\\",etc.),and a great addition to that genre of films has proven itself to be,by far,\\"The Departed\\".    Based in Boston (mostly South Boston,one of the most famous mob places in the world),this film focuses on several different characters. It begins with a good depiction of Matt Damon's character in this film,Colin Sullivan. While Colin did have an unhappy childhood (I won't give away too much of that--that is something for you to discover when you watch this film for the first time),the one man he had to get him through his childhood was Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson),a Boston mob moss who has politely welcomed Colin into his organization,with Colin and Frank remaining friends ever since they first met. For Colin and Frank,this is a trusted friendship that helps the both of them in the long run.    But,what is the one problem that lingers here? The problem is that Frank Castello has commited several crimes and is wanted badly by the Boston police,who who will do anything to stop him. Their luck comes along when two important Boston cops,a boss on the force named Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen)and a sergeant named Dignam(Mark Wahlberg)hire a man named Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio),who has lost his family and is an unsuccessful person. His job? To go undercover and become a member of Frank Costello's mob,in order for him to be able to help the Boston police bust Frank Costello (something that is a very difficult task for them). Once the investigation has begun and trouble has stirred up in both the Boston Police Department and Frank Costello's mob as a result of the investigation,can the good guys win,or will that honor go to the bad guys? Only time will tell!!!    When it comes down to \\"The Departed\\",while this film is VERY long (close to the same amount of time that \\"JFK\\" and \\"The Good Shepherd\\" were)and is complicated and hard to follow,on top of those two flaws,it is an excellentfilm. The plot for this film is very smart while it has a great scipt accompanying it. As for the performances,Matt Damon turns in a good performance while Leonardo DiCaprio allows the film to be interesting,and gives in an entertaining performance. But,the performances here that are REALLY worth watching are the performances of Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Nicholson brings a lot of suspense and drama into his performance,and allows viewers get to know his character and helps bring the film to life. As for Mark Wahlberg's performance,Wahlberg turns in one of the finest performances of his career here,as a no nonscence cop who plays it out tough until the very end. With his performance,not only does Mark Wahlberg contribute to this film's essence and success,at the same time,he allows his talent to continue to improve as an actor. Also,Martin Scorsese leads this film in a smart manner that will make one guessing until the very end,which is the main factor in this film being so well-planned and being the good film that it is.    The only minor flaw for this DVD is that the only extra feauture here is a theatrical trailer for this film. But,if you want to see a good amount of special feautures for this film,you will want to skip this DVD and get the two-disc Special Edition DVD that was released for this film--which has good bonus feautures that one would want and except on and with this DVD.    If you are a fan of mob films,\\"The Departed\\" is a must-see film. It is one of the best films to ever have been made and released. It has everything a good film needs (a great plot,a great script,a great cast,great acting,and a great director),and will probably continue to make an influence on film fans over the years,the same kind of influence that other mob films like \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" have. What you have here is a fine work of art.    5/5
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Quite a good film. I'm not sure why it seems to rub some people the wrong way. Perhaps the fact that a Mexican director is showing such international reach is a problem for some people. If so, that's unfortunate because it's a gift that films like this exist - films that expose American audiences to the complex interconnections of the modern world. Don't watch this if you're not willing to sit through a slow, thoughtful and understated film, though. This is a far cry from Brad Pitt's normal fair, but if you've seen and enjoyed any Alejandro González Iñárritu films this one won't disappoint you. <br /> <br />All the acting is good. It's nice seeing Brad Pitt showing his age a bit, looking older. I see this as his setting the groundwork for a continuing career, one that will carry on after his pecs and abs go a little soft. Cate Blanchett is a bit wet, but that's her character. It can't be easy to play someone who spends most of the film writhing in pain or feverish. Adriana Barraza is great. You really feel for her as she stumbles through a worsening situation. Gael García Bernal is always good, even though the character he plays in the one makes all the wrong choices. And Rinko Kikuchi is great too. Yes, her forays into sexuality may make you uncomfortable at times, but such is life. I find her character tragic, sympathetic, and very believable. <br /> <br />I don't think it's at all a trite observation to point out how small our large world is, how much the choices we make have ramifications for others far away. We need more films like this. Thankfully, with the director's success with this and other films, we're going to get them.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Great sets, cast, perfect ending, no profanity, I just can't say enough about it. Really...a perfect movie in all regards - not too many like this come along, so watch it, buy it, recommend it! Sure to be an all-time classic
B0006VIE4C|5.0|Star Wars, Episode IV- A New Hope (Widescreen Edition)~ Mark Hamill is great sci-fi movie and it does make a lot more sense after watching the first 3 movies which came out almost 30 years later. Knowing the background story explains a lot of things that made little to no sense before. For example, why r2-d2 and c3po are always together, the nature of Darth Vader, why Obi-one Kenobi is Lukes jedi master and many many other questions that one had whilst watching this movie before. The special effects are a bit primitive but for the time they were outstanding and some of the best in the business. The music is right on the money. The script is very well written and the plot is filled with action and and exciting adventure. If one does have to say something negative then it is to the fact that Mark Hamill  is a terrible actor and just about anyone could have played that part better. Even so this is a great movie and I give it 5 well deserved stars.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|Actually this movie had a lot of potential, unfortunately it didn't use it, it was boring, even the few action scenes were bland, yes they were realistic but that makes for bad TV. The plot jumped around a bit and there were many parts that didn't fit or just were not needed and ran on too long, not to mention there were parts where the sound was missing, yes I am sure it was for artistic reasons but when a man gets hit by a semi believe me it is not quiet, to me it just made the film seem amatuer and unfinished. Long sequences of nothing and too much focus on mundane subplots just made that film a waste of 2.25 hours of my life, I actually caught myself nodding off here and there, not to mention for cops trying to put a drug cartel behind bars they killed anyone who could have testified against the kingpins so THAT made it very unrealistic, there was no attempt to arrest anyone, just kill em all... pitiful.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|Though it has taken three decades, the pairing of George Benson and Al Jarreau - peerless music legends who both sprang from jazz into the international R&B and pop mainstream - was pure destiny.  <br />The parallels of their career paths, musical ideologies and fans bases would seem to have deemed it so many moons ago. Both have earned multiple Gold and Platinum albums, totaling millions of copies sold, along with coveted Grammy awards in both the pop and jazz categories. And both gentlemen are consummate and engaging entertainers, each capable of selling out an all-nighter by himself and still barely denting his catalog of timeless classics.  <br />The result is a landmark, 13-song album. Painstakingly prepared by Benson and Jarreau, \\"Givin' It Up\\" touches on every style and mood fans could imagine from this stellar event of musical matchmaking.  <br />\\" Givin' It Up\\" crackles with inventive covers of standards ranging from the 1940s (Billie Holiday's \\"God Bless the Child\\"); the 1960s (Sam Cooke's \\"Bring it on Home to Me\\" featuring a surprise cameo by pop legend Paul McCartney); the 1970s (Seals & Crofts' \\"Summer Breeze\\"); and the 1980s (Daryl Hall's \\"Everytime You Go Away\\"). They also show respect for the music of today, inviting neo soul diva Jill Scott to sing along on \\"God Bless the Child,\\" and turning in a sumptuous instrumental rendition of singer/songwriter John Legend's \\" Ordinary People\\" with Marion Meadows on soprano sax.  <br />\\"Givin' It Up\\" also features sizzling jazz jams on two Miles Davis classics: the classy swing of \\"Four,\\" with lyrics by the great Jon Hendricks and featuring Stanley Clarke on upright bass; and the lowdown blues of \\"Tutu,\\" rewritten as \\"Resurrection Blues\\" by Jarreau and set to Marcus Miller's dynamic original music (a homage to Bishop Desmond Tutu), featuring Miller himself on electric bass and special guest Herbie Hancock in scorching form on acoustic piano.  <br />Proving yet again why he's one of the most talented and popularR&B vocalists working today, Jarreau pens lyrics and sings on one of Benson's biggest hits, \\"Breezin', and offers a poignant reconciliation song titled \\"Let it Rain,\\" which also features the evocative muted trumpet of Chris Botti.  <br />The album is a masterful collection of smooth, seductive grooves and inspired reinterpretations of Benson's and Jarreau's most classic songs.  <br />The lively interplay between Benson's singular guitar work and Jarreau's unmistakable vocals give this jazz collaboration a truly one-of-kind sound and delivers harmonic depth and tonal richness which will garner appreciation from pop and jazz aficionados alike.  <br />Whether you're a long-time fan of Benson and Jarreau or experiencing their musical genius for the first time, this album is a treat for music fans everywhere.
B000002B1M|5.0|hands down nas is the greatest lyricist since the passing of biggie. nas proves his worth on this prolific cd. he avoids the sophomore slump that so many mc's face. classic songs include the hits \\"if i ruled the world\\" and \\"street dreams\\", the posse cut \\"affirmative action\\" featuring the firm (wow what incredible lyricists on this one!), the in depth \\"the message\\" and even a dr dre collabo with \\"nas is coming\\" (what could be better than the best wordsmith and best beatmakers on one cut?!). hey he even does the unthinkable of telling us a story through the eyes of a gun on \\"i gave you power\\". the lyrics displayed on this album are full of creativity, depth, and talent and the beats are very good as well. damn anyone who disses this album cuz they don't know what real hip hop is. this deserves 5 mics c'mon source magazine! cop this disc! <br /> <br />personal favorites: <br />-the message <br />-street dreams <br />-take it in blood <br />-black girl lost <br />-affirmative action <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|Pseudo-spirituality for busy, shallow, self-involved Westerners. Uses the names of famous people who are conveniently dead and thus can't defend themselves (Hugo, Einstein, Newton, Plato etc). Endess filler and reiteration of the sort of gunk that the New Age movement has been spewing forth for decades.    Written by, and for, the sort of lazy people who won't do the real work of self-knowledge and desire quick and easy answers. An easy cash-generating machine for parasitic mediocrities without any genuine talent or gift to offer the world. I have often wished I could lay my ethics aside and come up with a scheme to separate people from their money so easily - but long ago resigned myself to doing something useful that would allow me to sleep with an easy conscience instead.    Advice for people who think this sort of thing will make them feel better about themselves and their lives: stop spending your money on garbage and go sponsor a child in the developing world. You've already got it so good you've lost sight of your fellow human beings.
B00000I2PG|5.0|Here it is: ABC's \\"The Lexicon Of Love.\\" It's my all-time favorite album. I remember buying this with my allowance in my early teens (during those ancient vinyl years) and falling in love with it. I played it so much, the grooves started to turn a bit white. I always had a weakness for disco, new wave and strings and this album had it all. Trevor Horn is a producer that's so unique and creative. The man inspires me. Then there is, of course, the very talented band. What can I say? They had some serious chops!  <br />This Deluxe Edition is wonderful! The only thing I regret about it is that it doesn't include the 12-inch mix of \\"The Look Of Love.\\" <br />Nonetheless, get this cd. It's a true blue classic!
B00000JLEP|5.0|This is the third or fourth Scriabin CD that I have purchased and I love it.  I have been listening to the Piano Concerto over and over.  Its simply gorgeous.  Totally worth checking out.  If you like Rachmaninov, you will no doubt get into Scriabin.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|I enjoyed Syrianna but felt that it should have been 2 or even 3 well-developped films.  The list of stars is very long so I will just mention a few.  Of course, George Clooney gives an intense, great performance but why did Matt Damon get so little credit for his fine performance?  Both parts are essential.<br /><br />Probably what happened is that the part of Damon was underwritten while Clooney captures everyone's attention for getting tortured.  (The part about pulling out his fingernails was too graphic for my family's tastes.)<br /><br />Then we have the wonderful veteran actor, Christopher Plummer, who does his usual strong interpretation of his character.<br /><br />Jeffrey Wright deserves special mention for his intense portrayal of the man who had to clean up the mess--or did he manipulate the mess to advance himself?  One interesting part of the movie is how it shows that in matters of espionage, there is no justice, as we see with the way the Clooney character is treated.<br /><br />Finally, the actors who played the parts of the \\"terrorists,\\" (Kayvan Novak and Amr Waked) do an excellent job along with the huge supporting cast.<br /><br />Now why don't they do it over in three films and develop each part so that they could produce a masterpiece?
0743298020|5.0|I loved this story within a story - it reminded me of Wally Lamb's style of writing in I Know This Much is True. This is a super story of two women who share some of the same ghosts in their lives. I can't say more than other reviewers have said - it's a terrific read.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|I only give it a single star because I can't go any lower! What is wrong with Hollywood? I can't believe they couldn't find something else to vote for. I can't believe I sat there for that long only to watch something that unworthy. Oh, if you like seeing brains flying, blood spraying, cussing every other second, then by all means rent or buy this movie. You will be thrilled. If you are looking for a good movie keep looking!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|They have a sound and production better than any I have seen.  Outstanding talented girls and beautifully staged.  I'd recommend it to anyone who loves music.
B000HL0EW6|4.0|This episode of Star Trek, \\"The Man Trap\\" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, \\"The Man Trap\\" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered \\"adult programming\\", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).
0141439831|5.0|I had this book on my shelf unread for years, thinking it was tedious and boring, but what a revelation when I picked it up after seeing the movie. The note of the other reviewer re C.L.R. James, the left-wing Trinidadian author and historian, was apt, and uncanny, as I found this book could have easily be called \\"Westmoorings\\", an area in Trinidad populated by people of the exact mindset (and indeed I have heard many times the very same spoken words as the characters). Indeed, there are many places in the Caribbean, or world, populated by people like this. I see why this book is historically taught in literature in high school in the US but not in the Caribbean.
0743298020|5.0|Wow!  This book was so perfectly written.  The words used were beautiful and just made you want to know more. You could envision every place, person...everything in your mind.  Our book club talked and \\"argued\\" overy every aspect of the book for hours.  A \\"not put down book\\". <br />SUPERB!!!!
B000J103PC|3.0|Ok, so maybe it was because Meryl Streep got an Oscar nod for it.  Or maybe it was because Anne Hathaway was just coming off a one-two punch of daring roles in HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  Or, maybe it was because Lindsay Lohan WASN'T in the starring role.  I don't know WHAT it was, but somehow I got the impression that this was going to be an original and raucous take on the ridiculous fashion industry.  I thought we were going to see 13 GOING ON 30 meets HEATHERS or something like that.  I was prepared for ANYTHING other than what I got - a standard, paint-by-numbers, fish-out-of-water, Cinderella-story, PRINCESS DIARIES redux. <br /> <br />Alright, that's not quite fair. This actually is an entertaining movie.  Anne Hathaway ISN'T Lindsay Lohan (thank God) and does manage to engage you all the way through the film.  The writing is above average.   <br /> <br />And of course, Meryl Streep is outstanding, as always.  Her scenes are each works of art - a distinguished actress still at the top of her game showing the rest of the world how its done!  You can't take your eyes off of her when she is on screen.  Even as the bane of Hathaway's existence, she is pure delight to behold. <br /> <br />But the problem is, all this only adds up to an average movie.  The film starts off with a bit of promise as Hathaway's Andrea applies for a job she is woefully unsuited for at a top fashion magazine.  Her hope is to use the prestige of the position to springboard into the more respectable world of journalism.  Early scenes have her balking at the lunacy of fashion types and their obsession with those ridiculous costumes.   <br /> <br />After her third or fourth drubbing by Streep's delightfully \\"devilish\\" Miranda Priestly, Andrea receives a \\"come to Jesus\\" speech from Stanley Tucci (also a delight) and is presented with a choice:  quit the magazine, or take it seriously.  And folks, this is where the film enters familiar ground.   <br /> <br />With help from Tucci, a little musical montage to pass the days away, and little other reason, Andrea suddenly becomes the perfect assistant to Miranda, even outshining Emily, the girl she is supposed to be learning from, played by Emily Blunt in her critically praised, screen-stealing role.  <br /> <br />But of course, this success comes at the predictable price of her friendships and love life, until the predictable day when she predictably discovers that she is predictably becoming the very boss she loathed but predictably came to respect.  Which leads her to make a predictable choice for a predictably happy ending. <br /> <br />Yes, this film plays everything safe to ensure a standard audience-pleasing performance.  And it is a real shame, because for the briefest of moments, I saw in Anne Hathaway a hope that this film might elevate itself above the sea of mediocrity that it grew out of.  Films like 13 GOING ON 30 and JUST MY LUCK.  I really hoped Andrea was indeed going to excel at her job, but with the end goal of bringing down Miranda and her ridiculous magazine.  I had hoped for an ever-escalating series of fencing encounters between Miranda and Andrea.  Heck, maybe even a good bit of violence and mayhem to create a delicious dark comedy. <br /> <br />But, we get none of this - only a standard story of the simple girl who hits the big time, only to lose her friends and her own identity before making the right decision at the last moment!  Sigh - maybe next time. <br /> <br />The movie is worth watching for its stellar performances and slightly above-average writing . . . but in the end, it won't leave any lasting impression on you.
B000M06K5C|5.0|The critics, as you may have read didn't review this album quite well..i was really surprised because they all reviewd Silent Alarm as an heavenly awesome incredible album..while this one was just 'normal'.. <br />to me is TOTALLY the opposite.. i mean.. silent alarm is a nice album with a pair of great songs and a good rest..WHILE this one, to me is really a Pearl among Stones..every single song has something to say..each song is particoular..and different from the last one..the album in general is more experimental..it's not the usual rocky band boring guitar-bass-drums music..you'll hear many sounds that you wont' be able to recognise and weird but lovely and emotional vocal lines..to me every song is really good..the best among all this good stuff are surely: The Prayer (with the gratest chorus Bloc Party have ever written), Song for Clay, Waiting for the 7.18, and my favourite I Still Remember which ,to me, is the best Emo-Indie song ever written.. <br />that's all folks.. <br />support bloc party
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This is a truly defining moment in the history of popular music.  Until this album, there was a gigantic stone wall that divided rock and roll from folk.  Rock had invaded many other genres, such as bluegrass, the blues, reggae and even swing.  But folk had remained the private domain of coffee houses and protest singers in the vein of Woody Guthrie.  The thing is, rock and roll had precious little to say, miring itself in songs about light topics like teenage rebellion, puppy love and the romance of fast cars or surfboards.  Dylan by this time had emerged as the elite among folk singers, with songs like \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" and \\"Masters Of War\\" on his resume.  To say the risk to go electric would be large supremely understates the fact.  But Dylan decided that this was the moment for his big step, and he did so with a bang.  \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" is regarded as one of the greatest songs of all time in any genre; it's a cultural landmark, and it successfully bridged the gap between rock and folk by pushing folk music to a new generation.  But most important of all, rock was now free to speak about topics that it previously couldn't touch, and the artistic freedom would trickle down through artist like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, U2, R.E.M. and Nirvana, just to name a few.  There are perhaps a dozen critical junctures in the growth of music in the twentieth century - and this was surely one of them.
B0000CDL93|5.0|An Oliver Stone classic, this movie is packed with information, three hours and 20 minutes.  Based on the investigation by Jim Garrison that ensued the death of John F. Kennedy, it portrays the lengths that one man was willing to go to bring justice to the American people.<br /><br />You feel like you are brought back to that period of time when Americans still believed that our politicians were good people, and devoted to the freedoms that this country is based on.  The lighting, the quality of footage, the costumes, down to the very innocent yet naïve nature of the American public.<br /><br />Gradually as Garrison unravels the case, the situation gets ugly and then uglier, unveiling the true intention behind the death of JFK.  Garrison is confided in by many, telling him the facts of what they saw that day, evidence that was not only ignored but altered by the Warren Commission.  People begin to turn on him, including his wife.  This part of the story in particular demonstrates how difficult it was for Garrison, that even though his facts all lined up and the people knew about them, no one wanted to confront the horror of what this meant about our countries' leaders.<br /><br />Stone illuminates details about the war industry, and the policies that JFK wanted to enforce.  It is disturbing even today in 2007, that our government offices were so heavily involved in making certain that our president that wanted to bring about change for the better was assassinated because of it.  It brings light to what is happening with our President Bush and his war today.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Mahatma Gandhi as the Indians call him is indeed a Mahatma(a great soul)(But I rarely saw the usage of the word Mahatma in the western world, which I guess they don't like to use).  <br />His life is a message-message of love, peace, acceptance, tolerance, and finally it tells us that you should fight out of love for something and not because of hatred towards others. He fought for independence of people because he loved it and not hated Britishers.  <br />Strictly, only a handful number of people led such an accomplished and complete life. He died only after seeing the nation of India free. <br />As for the movie, it is very touching and a definitely inspires us. What I like is the quote of his, that is read out in the end where he says that \\"At some point every evil looks invincible, but in the end they always lose. It happens always, always, and always\\". Remember Hitler, of course the British empire. And in the present times when there is more and more injustice(under the cover of good), this should truly help those faintly lit souls standing in the hope of a society filled with justice, love, and peace.
B000E8NQUE|5.0|This is a fantastic album from the Moodies and the sound is excellent. This is one of the band's most dreamlike albums and can give you a contact buzz just listening to it. I love the fact that they've restored the album's original booklet and pictures as well as adding some cool bonus songs. This really is an album meant for surround sound. From the trippy In The Beginning, this album REALLY DOES take you on a voyage and every song is a must have. Everyone in the band contributes to this release and it's wonderful to hear the group mind at one of it's peaks. Truely one of the Moodies best.
B000059MEK|5.0|This album is probably the best album in the last 10 years. Aerodynamic and Superheroes are my favorite. Absolute masterminds behind this album!
1592402038|5.0|I found this calming and therapeutic. I've suffered semi-colon and \\"and\\" anxiety for years; perhaps to some extent due to translocations within the English-speaking world. My library contains Fowler's \\"English Usage\\", Strunk and White, the American Psychological Association Style Manual, the Chicago Manual of Style, and probably more besides if I ever get around to organizing it.  <br />The insidious trouble from reading the others is that they love to impose what that guy who was married to Margaret Mead called the \\"double-bind.\\"  (Bates, I think.) They tell you that they're not prescriptive, and that it's alright to do your own thing, but leave you feeling guilty about it if you do. I completely became unable to write \\"however\\" after reading Fowler, and it's a terribly useful word. Truss is firm and opinionated but somehow liberating. This is the first time in my life I've written a page containing four sets of quotation marks without worrying and I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003CMB|4.0|I've always been a fan of blues oriented rock music- especially live recorded music. This album is exceptional, no doubt, although I have to disagree with some of the previous reviews. I used to own this cd but gave it up after giving it a few tries. After reading these reviews I gave it another try. The sound quality is great and the performance is great too, but not the ultimate live album I was expecting. If you want to get some excellent electrified live blues rock music I'd recommend Rory Gallagher's Irish Tour or Ten Years After's Live at Fillmore East. Bottom line, buy The Allman Brothers at Fillmore East but don't expect it to be the best live album you've ever heard.
B000J103PC|1.0|because I lasted through precisely 41 minutes and 32 seconds, according to my DVD time counter, of this lumbering satire.  With humor as broad as the size 14 it mocks, The Devil Wears Prada manages to be even more self-absorbed than its purported target for mockery, the fashion industry press.  Even some swell New York shots can't save this utterly predictable paint-by-numbers movie from being a complete waste of time.
B0001FGBL6|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of, if not the greatest album in the gothic metal genre.  The music is heavy, and yet very melodic. My favorite song from the Album is cry for the moon. The song starts of with a part hummed by Simone, and then the choir kicks into full force; the effect is beautiful, and almost magical. The only thing I can say is, if you are thinking of buying the album you should, in fact anything by Epica is great.
B00005RY7X|5.0|If I was aked to bring a cd on an island to listen for the rest of my life, it probably be I Get Wet from Andrew W.K. <br />If I had to listen only one song for the rest of my life, it probably be also I Get Wet from the album I Get Wet from Andrew W.K. <br /> <br />This album is THE uplifting, joyful, loving, crazy, jumping, exausting, make you wanna hug everyone, proud, inspiring, motivating experience you'll ever have !! <br /> <br />If you're feeling down, you'll be cheering afterwards. <br />If you're feeling angry, you'll be feeling joy afetrwards. <br />If you're feeling depress, you'll be feeling motivated and inspired. <br />It will make you wanna jump everywhere and go ballistic  <br /> <br />If you were waiting for the messiah to come ... don't wait anymore because he have arrived and his name is Andrew W.K. and his bible is called I Get Wet !!!!!
0345479092|5.0|My daughter had difficulty taking naps.  While she slept beautifully at night she took very brief, and infrequent naps during the day.  I purchased a number of other books (Baby Wise, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child and Good Night, Sleep Tight).  This book was the one however that turned my daughter around within 2 days.  While I continue to use the other books as references (finding Baby Wise book to be the least helpful), I found The Secrets of the Baby Whisperer to be the one that 'clicked' for me.  I am so thankful I found it! I have suggested it to other friends who have had similar success.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to help their child find sleep.
B000002N1E|5.0|I don't own a lot of Prince cds .. but I sure can tell that if you want the best of what Prince can do ... you must have this album. <br /> <br />It's the kind of album that you press play a second time after the 18th tranck had finish playing. <br /> <br />I swear ... Is that Great !!!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Wow.  What a geat movie.  There are some very thoughtful and well-writted reviews about The Departed.  I believe I will go for a quick hit here and just express what a joy it was to watch such a well-directed movie filled with some of the best actors working today.  By no way shape or form is this a happy film, it is; however, a trip well-worth the taking.  The Oscar was well-earned!<br /><br />5 stars and highly recommended!
1582701709|2.0|There is nothing new under the sun, as someone once wrote.   The SECRET is a concept which has been written about for atleast the last 50 years. <br />So this is a new edition for the latest audience. <br /> <br />Read THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING and you get the same idea. <br /> <br />Read the BIBLE and it's all in there. <br /> <br />No hocus pocus, no secret, no magic.........you make your choices, you make your life. <br />In many cases, you play the hand you're dealt. <br />One door closes, another door opens......it's hell in the hallway. <br />Life goes on. <br /> <br />There are no easy fixes or magic pills. <br />Any gain takes work and attention. <br /> <br />You cannot sit back, read this book and wait for your life to happen perfectly for you. <br />You need to take action and move in the direction of your dreams. <br /> <br />Are you all that simple?! <br /> <br />Oh dear.....who said:  \\" Hydrogen and stupidity are the two most common elements in the universe.\\"!
B00000I236|5.0|Meryl Streep takes the lead in this adventure gone action movie.  Kevin Bacon always plays a great villain.  This movie is beautifully shot.  Great outdoor action movie.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I love this movie. The plot is amazing and the screenplay even more amazing. this DVD is worth every penny and the special features are pretty cool as well (seeing as though I'm from Boston). Great Buy!
0792164903|5.0|Tim Burton is crazy and brilliant.  This story has been brought to life in such a creative and stylish way.  Johnny Depp has such an awesome way of bringing his characters to life.  This movie will be a classic someday.
B000M341QE|2.0|...but at least Nicholson was worth a look, although i'm still trying to figure out just what Jack (an Irish gangster here) was doing in this film.  What you have here is a couple of undercover guys (Matt Damon & Leonardo DeCaprio), errr rats going through the motions of trying to expose each other for being the unidentified rodent in an attempt to bring down the head of the Irish mob. Whats left in its wake is alot of over-the-top dumb jock tuff guy cop talk with labored upper east coast accents (ie; let's paark the caar at th baar and get some bacaardi & cokes). Mark Wahlberg appears to be the only actor best suited for this role...only his talent is wasted here to the extent that you forget he was even in the film until the end. It's almost as though this film was manufactured on an assembly line and the editors forgot about Wahlberg.<br /><br />This outing from maverick director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver) is pure cliche on every level right down to his being bored with direction, thus boring the viewer with the same Rolling Stone song he's used in countless other films.  Nicholson & Alec Baldwin lend the film some credibility, other than that...don't read much into Access Hollywood's Scott Mantz stating this is \\"Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas\\".  Nothing could be further from the truth. This wasn't even as good as Cape Fear...and that was over-the-top for a reason.  It would appear that guilt finally caught up with the Academy Awards blunder for giving Kevin Costner's \\"Dances With Wolves\\" the Oscar in 1990 for best direction instead of Goodfellas.  This is a film worthy of purchase only if your a Martin Scorsese completist.  Otherwise...rent it instead. I wonder if the \\"2 disc special edition\\" comes with an alternative ending?<br /><br />olofpalme63
B000GFLE1S|5.0|It's a lot of fun, with a slightly predictable plot, but a feel-good movie often does. The character of Lola is fun, and the soundtrack is really a plus. It is completely safe for kids, and teaches a good message of don't judge a book by it's cover, although younger than 10 just might not get it (although maybe 10 year olds now do know what a drag queen is). The characters are all believable, and flawed, but all mean well.
B00005JPG1|5.0|This ranks up there with Seven and Fight Club, but is totally unlike both of those films. Whether you believe the main theory of this film or not, you can't deny how this nearly three hour film just flys by. The directing, acting, and pacing is all first rate. This is the kind of film that makes me want to be a detective. Kudos Mr. Fincher. We are glad to have you back.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|A SPECTACULAR performance that's at LEAST - if not more - amazing as the LIVE show I just saw this evening at the Chevrolet Theater in Wallingford, CT. Catch the tour show LIVE if you can AND buy this DVD, YOU WILL NOT REGRET EITHER!!!
1582701709|3.0|I agree with the premise of visualization and focusing on goals to make them happen. However, there are some things about The Secret that I don't buy into, specifically the belief that you attract and cause all the bad things that happen to you.  <br />  <br />First of all, how does it explain the happy go lucky positive people and little children who get cancer or other deadly disease, many of whom say they never thought it could happen to them?  <br />  <br />While hypochondriacs imagine themselves seriously sick or dying their entire lives and rarely ever get sick? <br />  <br />What about all the people who go out on trips expecting a perfectly wonderful time and end up in an accident or having a really awful trip due to circumstances beyond their control?  <br />Most of the people that I have known have always said they were never expecting or thinking about the negative things that happened to them.  <br />Then there are the constant worriers who rarely have anything bad happen to them (mostly because they are more prepared, which helps alleviate problems).  <br /> The New Age Movement want to believe they are in total control of life through magical thinking. This is a convenient belief system that tries to convince you that you have total control, which is simply not so. There are wars, natural disasters, evil people, diseases and other elements in the world that can affect your life, no matter how positive you are.  Slavery? The Holocaust? Child abuse? Did they bring it on themselves through \\"negative thinking.\\" Sorry, I don't buy it... <br />  <br />Much of the New Age Movement came out of Eastern, specifically Hindu philosophies, which have a basis in the concept of people being reborn into particular circumstances as reward or punishment for past life Karma. Therefore, there is little concern for others in that society, they can just say it's God's will that a child is starving or crippled.  <br />  <br />This sort of mindset can make people stop helping others or having compassion for others because they think that the other person's mindset must have caused whatever bad has befallen them. <br />  <br />
B000LC55F2|5.0|loved this movie -excellent acting and plot - I never figured the movie would end like it did... highly recommend movie
B000LC55F2|2.0|The prestige is an utterly boring movie. It takes a really long time for the story to develop. By time it does you are almost asleep.  I was excited to see this movie due to hugh jackman and christian bale being in them. But when I actually saw the movie I was extremely disappointed. My recommendation is avoid this movie. if you want to see a decent movie that has a magician theme to it, check out The Illusionist.
B000002UA7|5.0|I'm probably the least likely person to review a Kate Bush album, as an R&B/Pop lover of the Black sista persuasion but I have a English chat buddy who I trade music with and she recommended Kate Bush to me. I had heard of Kate before and had caught the \\"Wuthering Heights\\" video while flicking channels and landing on VH1 Classic and was awe-struck at this song about the classic novel. But never did I think I was going to be reintroduced to Miss Bush. So my chat buddy gave me this album of Kate Bush's highlights. And at first listen I was like, \\"Whoa...this is weird\\"...then slowly a smile started to creep on my face as the album went on and I noticed how Kate really draws you into a song by lyrics and weird rhythms and phrases...it's pure GENIUS! I love how each song tells a story...not the usual \\"I Love You\\" songs I'm used to listening to, there's more to the songs than meets the eye, which is like reading a mystery novel and trying to figure out the conclusion.  <br />This album has grown on me as I keep listening to it, and admist my Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey, The Killers and Mary J Blige albums, this album is nestled inbetween them like a gooey intellectual morsel.  <br />First off, \\"Running Up That Hill\\" has to be my favorite track off of this and me being a fan of 80's music, I guess it digested with me better. Still what a great intro and the lyrics of wanting to swap places with God is truly out of the ordinary. \\"Babooshka\\" is my next favorite, it's slinky, yet fun and the story of a woman testing her husband's faithfulness is like reading a children's fable book and laughing at the end of the happy ending. The music is beautiful and funky in one package! Other highlights I enjoyed were, \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" which is just a gorgeously arranged track with such a heart-tugging point of affection for someone. Also \\"Breathing\\" took my by suprise at first because I was like, \\"That song was soo not about that!\\" but it was...and I even got a bit emotional thinking about the baby in the womb breathing in the poison...deep stuff and heart wrenching. One of the most unique songs I've ever heard. Now I'm not going to escape talking about the two tracks from \\"The Dreaming\\", \\"Sat In Your Lap\\" and the title track are featured here and in their oddity they are the most complex of the collection. \\"Sat In Your Lap\\" is stark and in your face and has a thundering keyboard backing Kate up, while \\"The Dreaming\\" is almost a trance chant that it's just a world of imagery and hodge-podge of rhythm...truly the weirdest of the set! Other good songs, \\"Experiment IV\\" is soothing and has a cold computer soul about it while \\"Hounds Of Love\\"'s music gives the image of actual hounds running in the fields howling. And least not forget \\"Wuthering Heights\\" which is her tour-de-force and a very unique song, and her writing that at 19 is quite impressive.  <br />So to conclude, I find Kate Bush quite the artist and a visionary that she is. I know for a fact that she influenced alot of performers of today, and one that comes to mind is another favorite of mines, Tori Amos...who uses that imagery and quirkiness in most of her music. This is a great overview of Kate Bush's work, though this came out like when I was born, it still stands strong and has some themes that still apply to todays world. What an innovated mind that Miss Bush has!
B000CBSHK2|5.0|I've listened to this cd 3 times now, and each time I take away a little bit more. To me, this is an excellent cd, with many exceptional tracks. My favorites are Rectify, Conceive, Comfort of Strangers, Shopping Trolley and Heart of Soul. <br /> <br />These tracks are expressive and compelling, to me. And her voice really works on them. I'll have to go back and give worms another try, since the song doesn't do much for me as of this writing. I really love the vulnerability in her voice, though for some it comes across as whiny. Not for me. I think she's great, and I'm really enjoying her more organic style.
B000305912|1.0|The quality on this album is incredibly bad and pretty much ruins the whole thing. The instrumentals are okay and overall a lot of the songs have a nice symphonic sound, but the vocals are drowned out almost COMPLETELY by everything else. Sometimes I didnt even know if he was singing or I was just hearing a random sound put into the album. I dont think I'll buy anymore Emperor albums, since this was my first- but if I do, I'm going to make sure the quality isnt this bad.    I do love the cover art though!
B000NA2776|5.0|I bought the UK release on a friend's recommendation, and I have to say Mika is my favorite new artist of the past several years.  Every time I listen to this CD, it just makes me *HAPPY*.  People keep comparing Mika's voice to Freddie Mercury, but the music makes me think of a fresh new take on my favorite Erasure/Andy Bell songs from 15 years ago.  This is happy pop at its best - catchy and fun, but with a quality and depth that bears listening to over and over.
B00005JPG1|5.0|Most people know who Steven Speilberg and George Lucas are. Following directors such as them became commonplace back in the 70s when they brought us such blockbusters as Jaws and Star Wars. Now following the works of directors has become a bit more normal, not for everyone perhaps, but as any modern film buff will tell you following Tom Cruise will get you no where. Rarely do actors tend to consistently choose films with such distinct sensibilities as the singular vision directors tend to have. It has been said, by whom I do not remember, that directors keep making the same film over and over. If you look at George Lucas that pretty much seems to be the case. Stanley Kubrick perhaps not so much. Still, even with Kubrick eventually the term Kubrickian evolved to represent films by others that tended to remind us of what he had imparted through his works. I'm going somewhere with all this...<br /><br />With David Fincher, who many filmgoers may not know, there is definitely a distinct sensibility that he has that bleeds through to us with each new film he makes. Since Panic Room there has been a 5 year lull. 5 years is a long time to wait for a new film from a director. I will spare you the suspense and tell you that Zodiac was well worth the wait. The film is masterfully created and could not have been pulled off by anyone but him. There is already a film called The Zodiac that was made a few years back by. I saw that film and it was  a train wreck at best. Finchers Zodiac is almost 3 hours long, yet manages with far less overt uses of the modern scare tactics that have become so common, to keep the audience gripped and engaged.<br /><br />Now for anyone who does not want to read a spoiler do not read on. I am however not spoiling much in saying that the real life zodiac killer was never caught. That may even be revealed in the trailer, I forget. For a film with no killer caught, and no real resolution, it would seem to be a film not worth making. David Fincher manages to make you forget the killer was never caught. He also manages to give real and tangible suspense without having a cat jump out of a dark corner to shock the audience in lue of real filmmaking. Even compared to his earlier works which smacked of his MTV origins this film is much more subtle. You will not find the visceral twisted alien like den of the killer. This film is much more real and human far less surreal and inhuman than his earlier films. The real life conversations, vices, obsessions, sounds, images, and killings, produce a film that lets real every day terror seep into you as you watch it. Now I am sure this film will be too long for many, I am also sure many will not like it since it is not Saw, or Texas Chain-saw Massacre.  This is even different from his earlier films like seven or Fight Club. He has matured, evolved, and is able to do far more with far less.  I was throughly impressed and would see it again if I had the free time to do so.manages to make you forget the killer was never caught.

0375505091|3.0|I must admit, I bought this book from Amazon blindly and without reading the reviews. So when I recieved my copy of Annie's 2nd Volume of her A Photographer's Life series I was greatly dissapointed with the immense volume of family snapshots (easily 90% of the book) and lack of celebrity portraiture (about 5% of the book). <br /> <br />I don't think anyone can challenge Annie's technical mastery with the camera when it comes to shooting portraits - but I have to say that looking at the family photos there are a lot of technical mistakes that she has made in shots, but she has still included said shots into the book solely because of the emotional connection SHE has to it. <br /> <br />While I agree it takes a certain amount of courage to include photographs of your family in a book showcasing your work - I think the courage is more on the part of the subjects. And once you get over that this large happy family have let you into their world and look at the actual result we are left with a gaze into an atypical family which really doesnt have anything special to see. Annie examines illness, age, and rebirth, but these are things that are all too familiar with our lives and she breaks no new ground whatsoever - unlike the M.I.L.K. collection of books, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br />As I said earlier, with the exception of a few photographs she has carefully set up to take photos of her mother, father and best friend - the photographs fall very short of being examples of a master photographer. More oftan than not, subjects are left out of focus as a result of a super shallow depth of field or the composition and DOF provide essentially snapshots of family life, but seem to be treated as something more because they're black and white. <br /> <br />The bulk of celebrity shots provided herein are actually available in Vanity Fair's Hollywood as they come from circa 2000. The ones not provided in Vanity Fair's Hollywood are only of President Bush Jnr and members of hisadministration and a handful of other people you can do without the photos of. <br /> <br />The remaining 5% of photos are blurry desert landscape shots from Annie's work for a travel magazine and some shots of The World Trade Centre site. <br /> <br />If you're after photographs of celebrity artists from magazines like Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair I would recommend the following instead of this book: <br />- Vanity Fair's Hollywood <br />- Mark Seliger's Physiognomy <br />- Mark Seliger's In My Stairwell <br /> <br />And if are after books with honest and emotional subjects of familys then you should definitely buy the three M.I.L.K. hardcover hooks, FAMILY, LOVE, and FRIENDSHIP.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|This was a good mob movie. Very intense and edgy. Good acting by most of the cast (though Jack Nicholson was a bit too over). But I have been more impressed by other Scorcese movies. The plot has some flaws, the film is long (and has some boring moments) and all the violence starts to become banal. Conclusion : Oscar for best director OK, but best movie, best adapted screenplay and best editing is too much flattery. There were better candidates.
0375703764|2.0|..bring them back down with what turned out to be an interesting idea marred with annoying language and ineffective commentary. <br /> <br />You know how the best way to become uncool is to try to be cool?  That seems to parallel my feelings with this book.  It tries to hard to be avantgarde and trippy that it falls flat.  The author does not have near the command of the language that he needs to to build the kind of atmosphere that would have been most effective.  His foray into trying to write in different styles depending on which of the three narrators is currently speaking is an utter failure.  The rambling style of Truant is a huge detraction of the story, and I feel like his sole inclusion was to hit the reader over the head with the feeling of \\"this will change you\\" that keeps on being pushed. <br /> <br />With some of the reviews I read, I expected this to be on par with other books that challenged my perspective, such as \\"Infinite Jest\\", \\"The Wind Up Bird Chronicle\\", or even \\"The Name of the Rose\\".  The premise had promise, but with the sledgehammer pounding \\"this is weird and trippy\\" into your head every moment, it fell flat and far short. <br /> <br />I would have given this book an extra star just with the exclusion of Truant.  Parallel story lines are in vogue, but they are one of the hardest things to do well without having the disjointed feeling that hinder the building of suspense and flow.  Also, making something modern and experimental is great as long as it helps tell the story.  This doesn't.  I feel like it was a crutch that allowed the author to spend less time focus making it truly memorable with language.  How many weird blank pages and random quotes and non horizontal lines does it take to scream \\"This was edited by an amateur and a blind man who both went crazy!\\"  At times it feels like he was one of those kids in high school who idolized e.e. cummings and make words stretch diagonally and up and down because I'm an artist!  Finally, ask yourself this...how much of it was unnecessary?  Would a few more pages with one word on them or a few less have changed the book?  Or is it just as pretious as the scholars he mocks? <br />Borrow a copy.  If you love it buy it.  Just don't but it expecting it to be an epic. It's not.
0618477942|5.0|Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz Bradbury  Moving story, snort out loud humor, fascinating literary tie-ins, confidential honesty  and excellent drawings that sweep you along like a flood swollen river. This amazing autobiographical graphic novel by Alison Bechdel, well known lesbian cartoonist of  \\"Dykes to watch Out For\\" fame, is so intensely compelling that you'll have to buy two copies, because you'll want to lend it to friends and they won't want to give it back. Bechdel's \\"flashback style\\" recounting of the story of her funeral director/ literate english teacher/ gay father's \\"accidental\\" death and moments from her past that unfold as she discovers and deciphers their true meanings, will appeal to any reader. But they will strike the most resonate chord with GLBTA people, one that probably no other novel has ever come close to reaching. Don't miss this wonderful book.
B00005JPG1|5.0|David Fincher, director of the fascinating, impeccably composed, cerebral \\"Zodiac\\" has not heretofore been known for his subtlety though his \\"Fight Club,\\" \\"Alien3\\" and \\"Seven\\" are filled with Life and a doomed even ugly sense of reality. But \\"Zodiac,\\" the story of the Northern California serial killer, who was more aware of his reputation and celebrity than any Hollywood starlet, gives us a subtler, more rational Fincher than his previous films would suggest. There is very little of the trademark Fincher violence and brutality here and more of a psychologically astute and emotionally cognizant one.<br />\\"Zodiac\\" is a story of Men working together for a common goal: that of capturing the Zodiac killer. There is the Police primarily consisting of San Francisco PD Homicide, David Toschi (a remarkably committed and persuasive Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (stalwart and dedicated Anthony Edwards) and the San Francisco Chronicle reporters Paul Avery (intelligent, pathetically alcoholic Robert Downey) and Robert Graysmith, who would go on to write the book about the Zodiac murders portrayed by the excellent and wounded, ultimately crazed-by-the-case, Jake Gyllenhaal.<br />As a rule, in most movies of late dealing with serial killers, the serial killer is merely a jumping off point for brutal and disgusting slash and dash murders. But here Fincher has stepped back, adjusted his sights and telescoped on the psychological and emotional effects of the killings, the endless procedural details of the investigation (handwriting experts, the \\"2500\\" suspects), the letters sent to the SF Chronicle by Zodiac and the detritus of a 20+ year investigation that wears down and whittles away at any kind of normal life for Toshi and Graysmith.  As such \\"Zodiac\\" is more about the furtive, brutal legacy of the Zodiac murders and its effect on these two men than it is about the Zodiac killer himself.<br />Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith as a man possessed: alternately repulsed by the Zodiac as a mass murderer but at the same time fascinated by his facility with the obscure language of codes, symbols and puzzles and his seemingly insatiable, preening desire for celebrity. Matching his intensity is Ruffalo's Toschi. Ruffalo has never been more persuasive and effective even bettering his feral performance in \\"In the Cut.\\" Both men are obsessed with Zodiac and both pay for this obsession with the hard currency of years and loves lost and never regained.<br />\\"Zodiac\\" goes on a bit too long but its ultimate success can be attributed to its brilliant, careful and intricate accumulation and dissemination of case detail that forms the backbone of this tragic, interesting and intelligent film. The larger tragedy that this film inadvertently points out though is that Zodiac's murderous swath across California in the mid 20th. Century now seems oddly remote, old-fashioned and even quaint in this time of 9/11 and international terrorism.murderer but at the same time fascinated by his facility with the obscure language of codes, symbols and puzzles and his seemingly insatiable, preening desire for celebrity.

B00005JPFQ|3.0|I haven't aquired much interest in Nic Cage's more mainstream action films since his Leaving Las Vegas days. I simply went to see Ghost Rider for the thrill and excitments. It did give all that, and I enjoyed very much for that reason, but the story and characters are not very interesting and the love plot between Nic and Eva Mendes is even more low-key. I just think she's so wasted in a boring character without much depth. I have a feeling that Nic's ghost rider character is performed by stunt doubles since we don't even see his real face. Those scenes with the ghost rider are the real money shots. Nic was good with what he had to work with, nothing challenging for a heavy weight Oscar winner like him. Out of surprise, I was quite delighted to see Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot in support. They were both pretty scene-stealing. Fonda was exceptionally more outstanding playing the devil. He doesn't look evil, but his expressions and performances are. I also thought Wes Bentley was good as the villian. I almost had the chance to meet him recently on an indie Hank and Mike, but he dropped out and got replaced by Chris Klein. So I am not surprised that this film is selling, afterall, it's just a great popcorn movie filled with plenty of thrilling actions, stunts, and CGI's.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|As a way of background, I have been listening to the RHCP for years and I own a great many of their albums, including this one.<br />STADIUM ARCADIUM is truly one of their very best records, a perfect and most welcome achievement for their rich yet uneven career.<br />Everything that makes this band so great and unique is there, all there: ballads, funk riffs, rocking numbers, mid-tempo tunes, and... his vocals. ALL there. And what makes this album particularly great is that it is so rich in musical variety, shifting vibes, great musicianship, excellent compositions - and that THROUGHOUT the whole two CDs!<br />Also, you may want to read the review by Shawn Carter, it reflects perfectly my opinion in summing up why the album doesn't deserve the flack given by some of the \\"purists\\" and/or BSSM nostalgics.
B000LC55F2|2.0|The Prestige is another example of Hollywood's bent perspective being cast on the audience.  Frankly, I am so tired of the recent trend in movies from the major studios that suggests I must cheer for characters that are not likable, not pleasant, and certainly not anyone I would want to associate with in my own life.  Why should I want to spend a couple of hours of my life with this character, or characters?  Hollywood is giving me the self-centered and the self-absorbed -- characters whose actions and motivation are for the sole purpose of self.  Thus we have Christian Bale as Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, two talented actors playing the parts of competing magicians, each tying to get the better of the other.  Everything they do in this movie is for them selves. Under Hollywood's perspective these are the main characters we are supposed to care about and to whom we are to wish success.  Sorry, I just can't do it.   Since I can not wish either of these characters success, the movie fails.  A much better evening can be spent with The Illusionist.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|If you appreciate the updates to the Superman mythology made by Smallville producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, you'll appreciate this updated version of Iron Man's origin.  It was great to see shellhead's aquatic armor, the original robot-like grey suit, and the classic red and gold.  The animators used more CGI here than in the Avengers animated movies, but it meshes well with the cell animation.  The lava animation in the underground battle scene is excellent.  The pacing is fairly good and the changes made to both Iron Man's and the Mandarin's origins were clearly wise decisions.  Changes are good as long as they make sense.  The changes made here certainly do, especially in today's day and age where viewers tend to be more sophisticated.  If the storytelling for the 2008 Iron Man motion picture is half as good as this animated movie, it should be one of the best super hero movies ever made!  If you're looking for an intelligent update of a classic super hero along with strong storytelling and well above-average voiceover work, look no further than the Invincible Iron Man!  This is definitely geared for an older audience though.  I can't see children warming up to so much dialogue.  I can't wait to see Doctor Strange!  PLEASE MAKE MORE IRON MAN ANIMATED MOVIES LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (A stand alone Captain America animated movie would be a good idea too)
B00005JP97|5.0|When I saw the first theatrical trailer for \\"Black Snake Moan,\\" my mind immediately reeled over what the story was about. The concept of a half naked young woman chained to a radiator can go in many different directions, not all of which would be beneficial to the story. Having actually seen the film, I now know that the filmmakers went in the right direction; this is a fascinating, darkly humorous, and surprisingly heartfelt film that creatively explores the relationships between certain people. Taking place in a rural Southern town, a wealth of complex issues hide behind a simplistic, stylized plot, a fact that only serves to strengthen its message. The story is not concerned with finding convenient solutions; the intention is to show how the characters learn to understand one another. If peace is made, great. If not, at least one knows where the other is coming from.    I think the best thing about this movie is the main characters are neither good nor bad. They're portrayed realistically, deeply flawed yet not without redeeming qualities. We first meet Rae (Christina Ricci), an incredibly misguided young woman who periodically has bouts of nymphomania. She describes her condition near the end of the film; when she has a strange thought, it travels down her body as a burning sensation. Having been the victim of abuse as a child, her only method of relieving the pain is sexual contact. We periodically see her having an attack; she's bombarded with intense physical sensations, causing her to collapse and frantically touch every inch of her body. One gets the sense that she feels an unwelcome mixture of pain and pleasure.    We then meet the God-fearing Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), a vegetable farmer who was once a blues musician. He's a broken man, having just split with his wife of twelve years (Adriane Lenox). We immediately understand how immature she is; she wants to leave him for his brother (Leonard L. Thomas) because he makes her feel young again. This leaves Lazarus feeling lost; not only did he provide for her as best he could, he also never raised a hand to her in anger (even when he was drinking). How could she be so unfeeling to someone who treated her well? He tries to find solace in alcohol, his Blues music, and the Good Book. But it's to no avail; even his friend, the Reverend R.L. (John Cothran, Jr.) isn't able to help.    Then comes the fateful day when he crosses paths with Rae; he finds her lying in the middle of the road, barely dressed and beaten. She's also sick with pneumonia and under the influence of some heavy drugs, obtained the night before at a particularly wild party. For the next two days, Lazarus tries to care for Rae, who continuously slips in and out of consciousness (occasionally, she runs around the property, incoherently ranting and raving). While in town buying her some medicine, Lazarus learns of her promiscuous reputation, which prompts the release of his inner Dutiful Christian; God saw fit to send her to him, and because of that, he intends to cure her of her wickedness. He decides to tether her to his radiator with a long, sturdy chain.    As you might expect, Rae isn't exactly thrilled when she finally comes to. She tries screaming for help. She tries running away. She tries enticing Lazarus with her body. But this is one household where potent sexuality will have no effect. Nor should it; Lazarus may be flawed, but he also understands that people should have more respect for themselves. This is something he's trying to instill in Rae, which would be admirable if only his method wasn't so unorthodox. Nonetheless, its obvious that he cares for her and that he's doing this to help, not hurt. Rae has always let men have their way with her; if she had a shred of dignity, she wouldn't allow herself to be used.    As the film progresses, their relationship grows deeper, each one learning about the other's life. Lazarus eventually learns of Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), wholeaves for the military early on in the film. It's quickly established that he's just as emotionally handicapped as Rae; he suffers crippling panic attacks when exposed to loud noises. It's also established that the two love each other deeply, despite Rae's sexual overdrive. By the end of the film, the audience will come to understand that the two were meant to be together, if not because they're dysfunctional, then because their dysfunctions complete each other. What an interesting relationship: when separated, their problems work against them, but when together, they function harmoniously.    This is the kind of complexity that makes \\"Black Snake Moan\\" so engrossing. It helps that the film is perfectly cast, with each actor giving some of the most believable performances in recent memory. Jackson gives Lazarus a style that's both authoritative and compassionate. He's also makes him quite vulnerable, especially when he's around the kind-hearted Angela (S. Epatha Meckerson). Ricci does a wonderful job with Rae, perfectly balancing obvious sexuality with hidden insecurity. Timberlake shows terrific range as Ronnie, giving him a neurotic, strained edge that's matched only by his youthful naivety. All the characters add dimension to the story, something that effectively examines how the most unlikely people can leave lasting impressions. This is an original, finely crafted, well-acted film, and I definitely recommend it.

0061091480|5.0|This is one of the great self-motivation books i have read. Dyer gives a simple, step by step guide to defeating your \\"erroneous zones\\" or debilitating behaviors in your life.  He covers topics from anger and guilt, to worry and fear. His advice on stepping into the unknown and out of your comfort zone has proved to be the most beneficial in my own life.

0618680004|5.0|<br />Dawkins logically and systematically makes his case for atheism in this book. It's a fascinating read -- whether you believe in a personal God or not.  <br /> <br />If your faith is strong, this book might not change your view but it will still be a worthwhile experience. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist, researcher, and logician, and in presenting his case he has forged his tools out of history (correcting many misconceptions -- such as about the founding fathers who are widely assumed to be deeply Christian), the Bible (where he extensively quotes passages that were totally shocking and that I was unaware of -- and which leave no doubt that this cannot have come from a loving and compassionate God), and Science. He systematically tackles all the arguments/cases presented to prove the existence of God and makes a strong case debunking all of them.  <br /> <br />On a scale of 1 to 7 with 1 being absolute belief in a personal God(such as Jehovah/Yahweh/Allah or Zeus or Vishnu) and 7 being absolute certainity that God does not exist, Dawkins rates himself a 6. I rated myself a 2 before I read this book -- Dawkins has moved me over to 5.  <br /> <br />Voltaire said, \\"If God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him.\\"  After reading Dawkins, I wonder if a wiser statement might be \\"Even if God does exist, it will be necessary to ignore him\\" <br /> <br />
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I liked the film. Previous reviewers have gone on about its virtues (and shortcomings), but I was fascinated about many elements of the film. The time-shifting didn't bother me, since it was necessary for narrative coherence. The acting was fine from everyone, but it's Adriana Barazza who shines the most, in a sincere and heartbreaking performance. I wish the great Robert Altman could've seen this film; he's the guy who invented the multiple character/multiple plot movie, and I'm glad that Altman's influence is alive and well. NOTE: The DVD has absolutely no interesting extras, just a few trailers. UPDATE (12-31-07): I just watched Sr. Inarritu's first film, Amores Perros, and it was better. His subsequent effort, 21 Grams, was also better. I don't think he's progressed at all, given this big Hollywood budget. Those other \\"small\\" films were superior.
0815411839|3.0|I have read many Marilyn biographies and all have inconsistencies. <br /> <br />Spoto's version is just the same -- he spends a lot of time pontificating about the details and the aftermath of Marilyn's untimely death. <br /> <br />Minute details were also different from other Marilyn bios I have read. <br /> <br />Mugsy, her dog, according to Spoto was male and adopted by Marilyn. <br /> <br />In another bio, the dog's name is spelled Muggsie is female and was purchased by Jim Dougherty to be a companion to Marilyn during  his Merchant Marine days.  <br /> <br />I figure if writers can't get that small detail correct (both authors claim to have interviewed Jim Doughtery), how can the authors get the real version of Marilyn's death correct? <br /> <br />I doubt anyone will ever know the truth about Marilyn's life and death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000HXE12S|5.0|This is the first piece of Deathspell Omega work I bought. I was blown away at the deepness, darkness and glory of this album. This album was just so remarkable and revolutionary. I think this album is the next step for black metal itself. This album proves the scene is healthy and still has amazing bands to offer. <br /> <br />The music is played very well. All instruments involved with this album are played well and produce an intelligent and dark atmosphere. This album has 13 tracks and the performance on all of them is spellbinding. These are some real talented musicians here. The bass, guitar and vocal work are all amazing. I love the ending to the song Hetoimasia, when their vocalist growls out the word CLAWS! Anyway, the music in itself is excellent and will satisfy your need of pure awesomeness. <br /> <br />The lyrics on this album are also quite good. Their written with cleverness and intelligence. You have to read over the lyrics over many times before you really get what they mean but I love thoughtful lyrics such as these. Writing this good is hard to come by.  <br /> <br />The album artwork is a bit of an enigma. To figure it out, you will need to do some research and really think on it to get it. This kind of artwork is quite engaging and really adds to the overall dark beauty of this album. I have drawn some conclusions and made some guesses myself but I won't spoil your interpretations by telling you mine.  <br /> <br />Deathspell Omega pushes the black metal genre to a whole new level. I think this is a modern classic. This album is a must-have for any black metal fan. This is a band you need to hear. They are just so overwhelmingly good. Buy this album, now. You won't be disappointed.    <br />
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Penelope Cruz gives a standout performance as Raimunda in this strange tale of a village where most of the men are lovingly tended to in cemetery plots.  The story takes many twists and turns, but principally this is a tale about Raimunda's indefatigable spirit and protection of her daughter.  Almodovar captures the rhythm and feeling of small town life in Spain as Raimunda enlists the services of her neighbors to revive a restaurant, which becomes the hub of activities while the owner is away.  In so doing, Raimunda hopes to disguise the sinister events that have taken place.  Raimunda's sister, Sole, harbors a blithe spirit of sorts, whose return provides the premise for the movie and eventually answers many questions that are put forward.  Augustina completes this provincial triptych as a hippie of sorts, who is forced to come to terms with her life when she finds out she has cancer.  The characters feed off each other in typical Almodovarian fashion, but it is a conventional movie by his quixotic standards, and one of his most satisfying efforts, as it is sure to appeal across a broad spectrum of viewers, especially given Penelope Cruz' excellent performance.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Reposted: 12/01/2008<br /><br />Traumatic.  That's what the killings down by the lake were to watch in the theater.  Seconds before it had just sunk in: the reality of this moment.  This had happened.  These people were there together.  Their fear was real.  The man had come out of nowhere.  In the next moment they are being stabbed.  The camera does not turn away.  There are no quick edits.  We are not at a far master shot, either.  We're as close as those two lovers were to each other and we never left that space.  I am traumatized and perhaps I should be, but I wasn't ready for a mind-altering experience on the level of Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan.  And if you don't remember, those films were revolutionary for their depiction of realistic death by violence in a you-are-there manner.  It was appropriate to the subject matter for sure, that's why it wasn't exploitation or offensive in the way you would normally assume.  Zodiac, however, was not particularly gory in comparison.  Rather the humanity & reality of these victims and the sheer randomness of the encounters is what shocks.  If you are not used to this sort of thing, be prepared to be in a humor-less, mildly traumatized state for at least 24 hours after seeing this film.<br /><br />I had a theory about David Fincher as a director.  That theory stated that every other film of his is a masterpiece.  Seven was great.  Alien 3 sucked.  Fight Club was great.  Panic Room sucked.  Zodiac...  I can't say great, because I'm too affected by it right now.  And calling it entertaining or even art I'm not sure is appropriate.  It was not poorly done, but it's going to take some time for it to sink in.  I can't think of any reason to give it less than 5 stars, though.  Fincher has certainly taken us on a journey of frustration and terror from the vantage point of those aforementioned victims, the police, and the journalists covering it.  Since I assume that's a proper portrayal of their experiences, I think Fincher and company accomplished their goals.  The writing, acting, direction and all the technical aspects were so on the mark that I often lost my awareness of watching a movie.<br /><br />Now, who was the Zodiac?  If all the information portrayed in the film is correct, then it's clearly Allen.  I don't know that is the case, as I don't know much on this particular subject.  However, after just watching the film I am left with a few gut reactions.  First, Zodiac distinctly strikes me as either a law enforcement person or someone who was denied that type of employment.  It reminded me of Aldrich Ames or Robert Hanssen being disgruntled intell workers wanting to show their peers how incompetent these peers are.  I also sense a contradiction in thinking a child molester would even be targeting adults in the first place, since they often gravitate to children due to their lack of socio-sexual maturity; and even if they did why would they not rape any of the victims prior to their murder?  The whole talk about slaves sounded like a man who was always a subordinate and never allowed to lead.<br /><br />In that area of California, you also had a surge of New Age occult-like \\"free living\\" movements that a lot of traditionalists were emphasizing as fornication and a rejection of conservative values amongst young people.  It makes me wonder how someone who was a little too old to be part of these movements, who was raised very conservatively but had already concluded they themselves were a \\"Lost Soul\\" might respond to a sudden social movement that was embracing these non-traditional beliefs without feeling guilt or shame like he had.  Thus he is both seeking revenge on the imposters and by killing the transgressors also increasing his ranks of slaves of the Lesser Evil who will be subordinate to his Supreme Evil in the next life.  Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.  I've met a number of very religious people who oddly enough feel beyond redemption (their word, notmine) so they just become more screwed up.  It just usually doesn't include murder, but I see no reason why it might occasionally.<br /><br />But then I'm forced to think down another line.  Profiles of serial killers often seem to fall into two groups.  There are the extremely eccentric, fixated types like Dahmer & Bundy.  Then there are the media hungry ones.  And there are some killers who are a combination of both.  I'm reminded of the astronomy advances in planet detection.  They have found mostly planets that exhibit one or more of the following attributes: 1. They are large.  2. They are close to their host star.  3. They have fast revolutions.  Yet the Doppler spectrum shift detection methods tend to find these planets easiest because they produce the largest shifts.  As technology improves, more planets are being found that have fewer or none of these attributes.  Therefore, early conclusions by laymen that most planets were big, close to their host stars, and had faster revolutions than in our star system were incorrect.  In all likelihood it means there are a great many planets out there, with just a minority of them initially fitting these detection requirements.<br /><br />Applying this logic to serial killers, if the only killings we are attributing to serial killers are those that are clearly purposely similar or eccentric, and/or are the result of individuals who are looking for publicity & attention from police & the media, then concluding that the average serial killer exhibits these attributes could very well be erroneous.  A higher proportion of unsolved murders & disappearing persons could be the result of serial killers than we realize, with enough variation in methods and a lack of correspondence with police or media that they are never put into that category.  That's a truly terrible thought, but it makes sense.  Most people do not murder in their lifetime.  Yet there are murders and many of them are never even close to ever solved.  Someone is doing them.  Captured serial killers often mention the thrill of the kill.  It seems to make sense then that those murderers who do it once will likely do it again, especially if it was random to begin with.  Could there be a small subculture of silent, sufficiently pattern-less & non-fame-seeking serial killers out there lurking?  I hope not.  Maybe serial killers are prone like the rest of us to wanting attention & credit, and hopefully the killing need is more deeply tied to eccentricity & pattern.  I'd like to hope that were the case.  Anyway, at least I'm feeling a little less traumatized right now.  Probably not justifiably so, but we all need to sleep, right?screwed up.

B000M5AJQS|1.0|Everyone raves about this movie.  It won an Oscar.  My wife and I finally saw it.  We simply could not finish it.  The movie goes over the top with its reliance on vulgar language.  There is nothing special about a movie that relies upon the overly gratuitous use of offensive language.  The cursing and profanity laden dialogue simply gets in the way of the plot and, in fact, makes even the good characters, if there was one in the movie, unlikable.  I've learned a simple lesson in life that this movie confirms.  If the critics love it and Hollywood honors it, it is not worth seeing.  Stay away from this garbage.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I freely admit that I wanted to hate HOSTEL. I was even looking forward to debunking it here as overhyped, unimaginative, sadistic drivel long before I actually saw it. I don't think I can be blamed for this. the present, rather depressing trend of horror movies - which for some years has been towards \\"horror\\" (meaning disgust) rather than \\"terror\\" (meaning the good scare) - has left me itching to pull the trigger on most every new entry in the genre that passes my way, and mostly this urge has been justified.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. As a rule I despise horror movies designed largely to gross out or disturb the audience (I'm looking at you, Rob Zombie), and that is why I wanted to damn the film even before I saw it. And indeed, HOSTEL is truly \\"horror\\" in the disturbing sense, since the actual movie itself is far less scary than its concept of torture and murder as a sort of underground entertainment industry.<br /><br />Many of HOSTEL's critics contend that the film is one-half softcore porn and one-half snuff film. Others point out its many implausibilities. A few hold out that the \\"heroes\\" are all jerks and make it impossible for the audience to care about them. Some are just disgusted by the torture, which is as graphic as it is vicious. Most of this is true. The first half of the film IS very slow and replete with naked women; the second half DOES show people being horribly tortured and in some cases killed for the sick pleasure of others (surely the definition of snuff); there are a number of implausible and even ridiculous moments, the \\"good\\" characters are none of them very good people. But surprisingly, I found that these things did not matter, or at least mattered less than they might have, because of the movie's surprising strengths.<br /><br />First, the acting. It is not great, but it is uniformly good, much better than in most horror movies. The guy who plays Josh is particularly effective in his torture scenes - almost too believable. And the torturers themselves are frighteningly convincing. Second, the way the film opens, with dark-lit scenes of the torture-chair and tools being washed clean of blood by a whistling, unseen figure, strikes a deep creep into your spine - even before we're introduced to them, we know our cavorting post-collegiates are going to end up in it; the chair acts like a horrible magnet throughout the movie, drawing them slowly but surely into its comfortless seat. Third, the concept is just believable enough to do for backpackers in Europe what JAWS did for swimmers in the Atlantic; the idea that this type of thing, in some form or other, does occasionally go on in this world makes suspension of disbelief less necessary than usual in a horror flick.<br /><br />It is true that the main protagonist, Paxton, is obnoxious, pushy and much less likeable than either the funnyman Oli, or the sensitive weakling, Josh; but that did not make his ultimate outburst of revenge-crazed heroics less believable. On the contrary, if any of the three of them were going to kick some torturer a*s, he was the likeliest candidate. And he isn't all bad; midway through the flick he expresses remorse over freezing years back when he might have saved a girl from drowning; and at the end, when he hears the Asian girl scream in agony, he risks his life to rescue her from the blowtorch-wielding \\"American Businessman.\\" I have to say in this connection that a lot of the things people read into this movie just aren't there - the mild anti-Americanism is meant as a kind of in-joke for its American audience, not insulting to us, and the nudity and sex at the beginning, far from being a heavy-handed morality message (illicit exploitative sex = horrible but deserved death) were mainly used to distract the censors from the gore at the end (it worked, by the way).<br /><br />HOSTEL is not a great film by any means. It has many standard horror-movie flaws and one can certainly question the wisdom and morality of furtherdesensitizing our already violence-numbed populace by purveying this type of thing as \\"entertainment.\\" Still, horror is defined as \\"a painful emotion of fear, dread or abhorrence\\" and on that score, HOSTEL certainly lives up to its billing.of further desensitizing our already violence-numbed populace by purveying this type of thing as \\"entertainment.\\" Still, horror is defined as \\"a painful emotion of fear, dread or abhorrence\\" and on that score, HOSTEL certainly lives up to its billing. <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|First, I can't believe the comments from the people who are giving this movie only one star.  If you can't laugh at this movie, then you obviously can't laugh at yourself.  In society, we all strive for acceptance.  It doesn't just stop when you are a teenager in high school.  Everyone suffers from that battle in one way or another.  This movie does an extremely good job at poking fun at that.<br /><br />The homosexual suicidal brother, the angry teen son who has taken a vow of silence, the drug induced potty-mouthed grandpa, the motivational-speaking failure of a father, the pro-honesty supportive mom...the whole family is here and there's someone you can relate to.  Each has their own over the top problems but rally together in support of Olive, the little beauty pageant queen-wannabe, who has the opportunity to have her dream come true.  And what's to say about Olive but...\\"she's a very freaky girl!\\"<br /><br />This movie really hit home for me.  We've all had our moment to shine, and we all know it was either a polaroid moment or one we wish we could forget forever.  This movie takes those worst moments and shoves them in your face, and says, \\"Look, this is life. You win some.  You lose some.  Get over it! In the end, no one really cares.\\"<br /><br />I urge anyone who has ever failed at something, anything, to sit down and watch this movie with a light heart.  Laugh at it.  Laugh at yourself.  And walk away a better person, knowing you are not alone in this great big game of life.
B00005JP9V|3.0|There is a bit more to complain about than the excessive swearing. The ending felt pretty incomplete. I mean, it showed enough for viewers to guess what happened. But it was pretty disatisfying to not get to see the \\"Human Project\\". And did the ENTIRE movie have to be about nothing but the trip there? This was a story with much more potential than what was used. And WHY was the world-wide infertility not explained? Or was it? I don't know for sure since I find the British accent difficult to understand. Too bad they don't use subtitles or closed captioning in the theatre. <br />The vivid cinematography and attention to detail can be appreciated since it successfully pulls the viewer in and makes you feel like you are actually there in this grim, futuristic version of our world. <br />A special kudos for how the action scenes were handled. Who would have thought the idea of using only one camera and no music would work so well. But why not do it that way? That's just how it would look, sound, and feel if you were actually there. During the action scenes, the camera stays right next to the main character (can't remember his name). This truly helps us feel the severity of the situations he is in. You gotta love that first action scene where the car is ambushed in the woods. Very exciting, despite the fact that the camera remains inside the car the entire time.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|I'm new to the blues genre, which is why I have to thank John Mayer for making it accessible on a commercial scale. <br /> <br />Though this may annoy or anger hard-core blues fans, I personally think it's a good thing.  <br /> <br />I've listened to John since he first released Room For Squares. I've always enjoyed his work, but always felt he was being marketed as something he wasn't: i.e. a pinup boy for teenage girls with raging hormones and questionable taste in music.  <br /> <br />With Continuum, I finally saw the REAL John Mayer in action -- though his previous performances at awards ceremonies ( my main source of JM 'live' appearances, considering where I live ) have been consistently spectacular. Maybe that's why I knew he was capable of much more, if only the recording company would let him shine. <br /> <br />I probably should've bought Try! before getting Continuum, but the former sold out last year, resulting in this reversed sequence. ( Thank goodness for Amazon. :)) <br /> <br />In hindsight, it's a huge advantage, purely because Try! is far superior to Continuum, because it's (1) \\"live\\", (2) much more diverse in terms of material, and (3) has loads of phenomenal no-holds-barred jamming. <br /> <br />Every piece is a masterpiece, but personally speaking, 3 definitely stand out. Vultures, my top favourite from Continuum, is unbelievable \\"live\\", with John's raw, slightly raspy vocals conveying much more poignance than the no-doubt-tweaked-and-retweaked studio version.  <br /> <br />Out Of My Mind, on the other hand, literally blew my mind ( pun intended :))! I first heard it in the car driving to work. Immediately turned up the volume and reckon I almost broke the windscreen ( haha ). John may not be hailed as a really good singer ( his skills on the guitar usually steal the limelight ), but his delivery on Out Of My Mind easily rivals the great Ray Charles -- the resemblance is spooky, man. <br /> <br />Best track by far, however, is I Got A Woman. Quite a crowd pleaser, considering its origins ( and a later sampling on Kanye West's Gold Digger ), but absolutely perfect here. Great vocals, cool-beyond-cool jamming, super hot and steamy.  <br /> <br />Am predicting a looong life cycle in my stereo -- for the next few months at least.  <br /> <br />Truly mind-blowing. I highly recommend this to anyone who'd like to know what great musical talent sounds like.  <br />
0316172324|5.0|This book is very enjoyable and explains how we subconsciously \\"think\\" and react.  It shows that some subconscious processes with a \\"thin slice\\" of data are more accurate than if done consciously with more data!  Of course there is a dark side to \\"thin slicing\\" which is when it prejudges based on society's rules/actions.  That is why he emphasizes that it takes practice to harness this power.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Isn't it odd that the majority of the people that give this low ratings, have something negative to say about Al Gore.

B0001HAISG|1.0|So a live-action adaptation of Peter Pan (again?) came and faded.  It was average to most people, and wasn't very memorable at all, and possibly for good reason.<br /><br />The acting was sub-average on many parts, with a boring plot, and it was essentially nothing but a live-action adaption of the original Peter Pan, with some very adult changes.<br /><br />For one, the Lost Boys and Peter Pan appear to be obsessed with death and killing, as their first reaction to seeing Wendy flying in the air is \\"kill it!\\" and when she falls to the ground unconscious, they are narrowly stopped from killing her by Peter Pan.  Hook is a mad bloodlusted butcher constantly killing crew members at random moments, offing at least three or four of them during the scene where Wendy is telling a story.  Several fairies also die, quite comically, but die nonetheless.<br /><br />Pan also appears to be someone's bad idea of a character created on drugs.  He not only has no cares, but appears to care about absolutely nothing, and has a constant \\"whoa\\" attitude to him.  He also frequently forgets peoples' names, even after being told their names less than a few minutes before.  He's obsessed with killing, and frequently threatens to kill various Lost Boys.<br /><br />There's also a lot of pre-teen sexual energy going on between Peter Pan and Wendy, so potent that it's really quite sick.<br /><br />All in all, this was a quite pointless adaptation, with lots of violence, drug innuendo, and at least a dozen or so corpses by the end of the film.

B000E1YVZU|4.0|Grrrrr... <br /> <br />Mind you, I've never seen the show on stage, but the original cast album points toward everyting pretty much being sang (ie a Rock Opera).  I can just imagine what it was like opening night when Mark's first original words were spoken... <br /> <br />Other than that, and the fact that Rosario Dawson had played Roxanne and probably killed Hephaistion (which means that I can't like her), the movie's pretty good.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|It was only last Summer that Madonna released the live album/DVD combo \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\\", which was a mixed bag: mediocre CD (due to too many songs from the dreadful \\"American Life\\" album), but interesting DVD (documentary with \\"all access\\" to Madonna and her surroundings and \\"regular\\" life). Now comes this new release.<br /><br />\\"The Confessions Tour\\" is exactly as advertized: this is based on the tour Madonna did last year in support of the enjoyable \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" album. The DVD (120 min., plus 20 min. of bonus materials) brings in its entirety the show from London's Wembley Arena. Since \\"Confessions\\" was actually a pretty good album, this is a much better journey, musically speaking, than \\"Tell You a Secret\\". The irresistable dance-along opener \\"Future Lovers/I Feel Love\\" immediately sets the tone, and is one of the better tracks. Other highlights include among others \\"Get Together\\", \\"Confessions\\" and the nostalgic \\"Lucky Star\\". There really are only a few songs off-track, such as the disco-fied \\"La Isla Bonita\\", losing all of its original reggae-lite flavor that made is so good to begin with. BUYER BEWARE: the concert is shot MTV-style, meaning the camera angle literally changes every second or two seconds (sigh). The bonus materials is nothing more than about 20 min. of rehearsals for the tour, and not necessary or even interesting. The CD (13 tracks, 73 min.) brings a selection of the 21 songs from the full show, and as such the selection is quite good. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and \\"Live to Tell\\", 2 of the weaker songs, are among those left off.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Confessions Tour\\" is a nice addition, and not too repetitious of last year's \\"Tell You a Secret\\". The music on the DVD is really what this is about. I saw Madonna doing her now infamous warm-up gig for the upcoming tour at the Coachella festival last April, and it was one of the most memorable 30 min. shows I will ever witness.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is an excellent gothic thriller based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, Eisenheim The Illusionist, set in late 19th century Vienna about the son of a young cabinetmaker who falls in love with a young Viennese aristocrat and is banned from seeing her as he is a basic commoner. As the legend goes about the young lad, he meets a travelling magician on the road who shows him the secrets of illusion, where he sets off to exotic lands to learn the mysteries of life. He returns to Vienna after his travels and opens a show in the great city to astonish not only Vienna's common public with his quasi supernatural illusions, but also Crown Prince Rudolf, son of Emperor Franz Josef who then reigned over the Austrian Hungarian Empire.<br /><br />Originally the short story was written as a political criticism of the Monarchy, based on the scandalous incident, where the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera were found shot in a Royal hunting lodge, apparently a murder suicide which the Royal family kept from the public for many years.<br /><br />Edward Norton as Eisenheim is understated and brilliant, as the many sleight of hand tricks in the film were actually done by the gifted actor. Norton must have practiced for months to reveal such confidence and skill needed for these types of trick. However, Norton's character portrayed a perfect man of mystery, begging the question, are these mere illusions or does Eisenheim possess supernatural power, controlling matter, energy, space and time itself.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are well done. My favourite illusion in the film, (and they're many) is the Excalibur Sword illusion where Eisenheim borrows Rudolf's sword, somehow magnetizes it to the stage standing straight up, asking the various aristocrats' in the audience to release it from its position. Of course none can release the sword, as they, like the Arthur legend, are not meant to be king. When Prince Rudolf attempts to pull the sword from its stationary stance, he finally does so with great effort; by causing the ruthless Prince some embarrassment, Eisenheim is now a targeted enemy of the Crown.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti as the corrupt Inspector Uhl really shows what a versatile and gifted actor he really is, able to do comedy, tragedy, fantasy...a very impressive performance.<br /><br />The overall look of the film had the atmosphere as if we are viewing a primary historical source, the director using 80 year old editing techniques etc., this was unusual but effective for such a mixed genre film - fantasy, thriller, supernatural thriller and fairy tale romance.<br /><br />When first seeing this film I was spellbound and the ending, a perfect twist, making The Illusionist a perfect example of skilful storytelling.<br /><br />This is an excellent film.the sword from its stationary stance, he finally does so with great effort; by causing the ruthless Prince some embarrassment, Eisenheim is now a targeted enemy of the Crown.  <br /> <br />Paul Giamatti as the corrupt Inspector Uhl really shows what a versatile and gifted actor he really is, able to do comedy, tragedy, fantasy...a very impressive performance. <br /> <br />The overall look of the film had the atmosphere as if we are viewing a primary historical source, the director using 80 year old editing techniques etc., this was unusual but effective for such a mixed genre film - fantasy, thriller, supernatural thriller and fairy tale romance.  <br /> <br />When first seeing this film I was spellbound and the ending, a perfect twist, making The Illusionist a perfect example of skilful storytelling.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent film.           <br />   <br />

B000050FEN|5.0|Few trends in modern film have proven more loathsome and tedious than the spate of derivative serial-killer movies inflicted upon the public over the last 15 or so years but, as is so often the case, this tiresome trend was kicked off by something good.  As you may have guess, that \\"something good\\", in this particular instance, is \\"Seven\\".  Now, \\"Seven\\" is hardly the first or the most important of the contemporary serial killer flicks, (the overpraised \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" gets that title) but it seems to me that \\"Seven\\" is the film that proved that the trend had legs, thus opening the flood gates and providing a sort of visual template for countless thrillers and horror films to come.  \\"Seven\\" also provided the major breakthrough for sophomore director David Fincher, who would prove to be one of the most exciting and distinctive directors of the last decade.  But, we're not here to talk about the legacy or influence or whatever of the film, we're here to discuss \\"Seven\\" itself, and it's a damn fine film, a modern classic and the best of its (all too often substandard) ilk.<br /><br />I doubt  I need to go over the plot for anyone, but here's a taste:  Det. Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) is one week away from retirement when he receives a new partner, the young, haughty Mills (Brad Pitt) and a new, rather peculiar case:  An obese man is found in his rotted, infested home, dead with his face in a bowl of spaghetti, his hands bound and his stomach, well, burst open; the man was forced to eat himself to death.  Sommerset knows immediately that this is no normal case, and his suspicions are confirmed when a prominent defense attorney is found dead in his office of unwillingly self-inflicted wounds, the words \\"Greed\\" spelled out in blood.  Further investigation into the original crime finds that the words \\"Gluttony\\" was spelled out in grease behind the fat man's refrigerator.  Clearly, these crimes were committed by the same man, and he obviously has something of an agenda.<br /><br />I'm not gonna tell you that \\"Seven\\" isn't steeped in the clich&eacute;s of its genre, but I've no need to deny it cause the clich&eacute;s aren't typically the real problem with any particular film.  In fact, I'll just add another clich&eacute; to the pile by saying that Fincher and company build all this up into something which somehow transcends the genre, something which manages to stand at as totally distinct even after it has been imitated by countless other neo-noirs.  Imitation is easier said than done, however, and \\"Seven\\" particularly stands out because its bleak, grimy, industrial atmosphere hasn't been matched in the twelve years since it was released.  Furthermore, many of the knockoffs missed the point and the effectiveness of the film, failing to see how \\"Seven\\" is actually quite beautiful and elegant at times too, each shot deliberately composed, and its this contrast that really makes the film work.  All this combines to create an atmosphere that isn't just bleak, but also otherworldly and even ethereal.  Though there's nothing overtly supernatural in the film, it has a definite air of the unreal.  Almost everything apart from our few major protagonists remains ill-defined: the city is unnamed, forever shrouded in opaque sheets of rain and we see little of the oft-faceless inhabitants; the killer, John Doe, is even more mysterious, a mad, avenging angel with no history and no explanation for how he became as he is.  He doesn't even have fingerprints.  He just is, just the embodiment of the ideas he embraces.<br /><br />Though the film is mostly slow-moving, the few more action/tension oriented scenes are executed with effectiveness equal to the rest of the film.  A SWAT team assault is tense and energetic, but an extended chase involving Mills and Doe is even better.  I'm usually not particularly impressed by this kinda foot-chase, but this one is just stunning, and easily the most hyper-noirish scene in the very noir film.  The climax is also well-done, sucking every drop of tension out of the scenario that is to be had.<br /><br />Though Fincher's visual and atmospheric brilliance would be sufficient to carry a film that was merely passable in most other regards, the story and acting in \\"Seven\\" prove exceptional as well.  Truth be told, Walker's script is, in a lot of ways, fairly pedestrian, but he comes up with enough effective moments and ideas to lift it above the pack, and the very well conceived ending makes it all come together as more than a sum of its parts. Many people will no doubt tell you that the ending is predictable, but I don't think it's supposed to come as some grand surprise.  The conclusion isn't predictable:,it's inevitable.  As a whole \\"Seven\\" is just a smartly constructed film, one which maintains interest continuously even when not a whole lot is happening much of the time.<br /><br />Though Pitt does a good job as Mills, and Paltrow (whom I don't usually much care for) is perfectly cast as his meek, strangely innocent wife, Morgan Freeman is the heart of the film.  His character is, again, a clich&eacute;:  the burnt-out cop who's just waiting too retire, and who is reacts to the parade of horrors he's seen over the years by cultivating apathy, and who is irritated by his young, more idealistic partner.  I'm not sure if anyone else in the world could've pulled this role off, cause Sommerset is such a dark and almost bitter character that he could be tough to feel for, but Freeman is such an inherently likable actor that you can't help but like him.  John Doe, brilliantly played by the always great Kevin Spacey, is far more interesting than your average lecturing psychopath.  His long speeches at the conclusion of the film are also surprisingly believable, coming more as the passionate rants of someone who has thought about these issues long and hard, rather than just a rehearsed lecture.<br /><br />Needless to say, \\"Seven\\" isn't for all tastes.  It's not as gory as it's been made out to be by some, but it's unrelentingly grim and disturbing.  (Though it does have a few touches of black-humor which work quite well.)  Still, if you like this kinda thing you'd be hard pressed to find a better film of this sort.<br /><br />Grade: As also well-done, sucking every drop of tension out of the scenario that is to be had.<br /><br />Though Fincher's visual and atmospheric brilliance would be sufficient to carry a film that was merely passable in most other regards, the story and acting in \\"Seven\\" prove exceptional as well.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|Sahara is great fun, with lots of historical aspects added in to the present day adventure.  I found a few problems compared to Cussler's book, but that is okay.  Overall the character of Dirk Pitt being played by Matthew McConaughey to be pretty spot on.  Zahn as Al Giordino was not cast well, however, as he looks nothing like Cussler's character from the several books Al has been in.  Besides that, the story is great and the \\"thrill of the chase\\" is always done right.  The scenes in the desert were fun and remind you of Indiana Jones movies perhaps.  I have learned that many more of Cussler's adventures will be made into films so I look forward to seeing Dirk Pitt in lights soon!
B00009MGQL|5.0|All I knew about Jeff Beck before this album was one song I heard on the radio.<br /><br />This guy is awesome!  He ranks up there probably above Joe Satriani!<br /><br />Sometimes he is a little \\"hard\\" for my taste but his virtuosity is astounding.  Steve Vai would drool in envy.<br /><br />Haveing found out that Jeff is no newcommer to the art it makes sense that this kind of quality playing comes with age and maturity in the art.<br /><br />YES - go buy it now!
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I was disappointed in this CD. The CD was monotonous and all of the songs were slow. No variety. It's not the Norah Jones that I have enjoyed for the last few years.
B000002J1S|3.0|I loved this album as a kid because it gave me all kinds of cool sounds to play in my D&D games with my friends.  I am also always attracted to the unique and different.<br /><br />This work is an attempt at a kind of rock opra and the tallent of the guys that did this make it a landmark work in the history of pop music.<br /><br />The amazing thing about this album is how rich the music is with so few instruments and so little effects added.  The music itself has many marks of genious.<br /><br />However, the content is void of meaning to me.  It is poetic more than functional.  If your in a melancholy mood, it makes for good listening, but beware, you might become more depressed!
B00000255F|5.0|If instead they'd titled this CD \\"Greatest Hits,\\" I'd have no real argument with that. Not to downplay many other great songs and albums by the Boss, I just don't know of any other collections by him, or any other artist for that matter, that feature such a solid lineup of songs. Maybe you're thinking this is just more hype from a fanatical Jerseyite, and maybe you're partially right.  I am a transplant here though, with no special homegrown state pride.  Listening to this collection does somehow make living here seem here a little bit special though, which is saying quite a lot for Springsteen, the CD, and a place like this.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|Somehow, I thought a filmed version of one of my favorite tV shows would fail, but in Michael Mann's hands, it came out very well.  I didn't buy Sonny's attraction to the woman, but otherwise it was a nicely crafted story.
1401302378|4.0|Anderson's book presents an engaging overview of the Internet-based world of commerce. As he says, instead of chasing a million people to buy a limited set of products, we now offer a million products to one person. From my small home, I can access dozens of cable stations (more if I'd opt for premium packagess), millions of books via amazon, and thousands of movies through Netflix.<br /><br />Information economics means that I can sort through these huge numbers to find what I'm likely to enjoy. Information gets dispersed through voluntary reviews (like this one)and through computerized suggestions (\\"viewers who liked this movie also enjoyed...\\")<br /><br />Anderson's book compares virtual shopping with brick and mortar stores, emphasizing that what we're buying is choice and information. Netflix and Amazon give us access to movies and books we can't find anywhere else. And online can introduce us to books, movies and music we would never find otherwise.<br /><br />I only wish Anderson had been more critical of the phenomena he describes.<br /><br /> Watchdog sites can be extremely helpful. I use them myself. But  they can also do harm. Writing on citysearch, one disgruntled customer criticized the dog lounge where I've been a regular customer. There's no way to gauge whether one negative will overcome the many well-deserved good reviews this  place has gained. One author was hurt because I gave his book only 3 stars: he claimed I had been responsible for a sales slowdown. Me? I doubt it. But who knows?<br /><br />Second, Anderson's discussion of wikipedia raises questions about how far we can take the Long Tail. Anderson argues (p 70) that \\"Your odds of getting a substantive, up-to-date, and accurate entry for any given subject are excellent on Wikipedia, even if every individual entry isn't excellent.\\"<br /><br />Even if the odds are \\"excellent,\\" the problem is that you may not be able to evaluate the quality of the particular entry you select, just as you often can't evaluate the accuracy of comments on a consumer review site.  After all, if you're looking up an entry in wikipedia, chances are you don't feel you're an expert.<br /><br />For recreational use, that's fine. But I agree with universities who have banned the use of Wikipedia among students.<br /><br />Anderson says your odds of finding a quality entry are higher on Wikipedia than in Britannica simply because the number of entries is higher. I believe the reality is that you're more likely to find an entry about a topic on wikipedia, because more topics are covered. So let's say you seek information on Topic X, which Britannica ignores. You are more likely to find entries on Wikipedia. The odds that the particular entry you find will be of high quality..that's a different story.<br /><br />Finally,  I can't help contrasting the responsive, targeted, interactive style of Internet phenomena with the infratstructure that still dominates much of our lives. On page 184, Anderson notes that we're finding \\"tribes\\" based on shared interests, transcending geographic location. Yet so many features of life depend on location. Health care, credit  cards, insurance, education and justice systems all remain dinosaurs.<br /><br />But we have to give Anderson credit: he gets us thinking about these things. I already have homes on the Internet and this book helped me recognize the directions I'll need to take in future. I can't imagine an Internet marketer who would not want to read this book.st as you often can't evaluate the accuracy of comments on a consumer review site.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti shine in this beautifully photographed period piece.  I never even saw that ending coming.  Kudos to the director and screenwriters as well as to the cast.  Fascinating and worth seeing more than once.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|this was a great film , with twist in it. and a nice amount of gore. worthy of being a sequel to the serie's.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman are perfectly cast in this story of a man who discovers he's a fictional character whose creator is about to kill him off.  Will Ferrell is a naturally sympathetic fellow who will tug at your heartstrings but not in a  manipulative or contrived fashion.  I'm still not sure if the others around him were all fictional too, but in the end, it's not a flaw in the story.  Just something to ponder.
B000EGDC14|4.0|I'll admit I found Goldfrapp later than most. I'm over a year late and two albums passed in discovering this British duo. They should have come to my attention much earlier since they remind me in ways of Eurythmics, T. Rex, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Human League, OMD, Erasure and Siouxsie and the Banshees all rolled into one.<br /><br />\\"Supernature\\" is full of electronic beeps, buzzes and burps, and it all works just as well as The Postal Service's \\"Give Up\\". I think a few tracks could have been cut in order to make this a tighter listen such as \\"You Never Know\\" and \\"Koko\\". The strongest cuts are \\"Ooh La La\\", \\"Lovely 2 C U\\", \\"Ride A White Horse\\", \\"Fly Me Away\\", \\"Slide In\\", \\"Satin Chic\\" and \\"Number 1\\".<br /><br />If you haven't heard Goldfrapp and might be interested in some new electronic music, \\"Supernature\\" will do the trick. It's more dance/electronic based that Goldfrapp's first two albums, and I hope they continue to expand upon this and even grow further musically with subsequent releases.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Not just another road trip with a dysfunctional family.  These people are seriously screwed-up, but they care so much about the girl and her dreams of pageantry that they will do anything to get her on the stage in time.  A fantastic cast and a daring screenplay make this one worth owning. <br />
B0000640VN|2.0|This movie pairs Hugh Jackman at his most charming with Meg Ryan at (unfortunately) her most annoying -- he plays a delightful and charismatic nineteenth-century English nobleman while she plays a modern-day working woman who's meant to be spunky and independent but who comes across mainly as bad-tempered and frenetic. Plus, she has a truly awful haircut. They don't have very good on-screen chemistry, and the plot of the movie doesn't have much originality -- if you're a fan of time-travel romance, you've likely found this kind of story done much better elsewhere.
B000J103PC|4.0|Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt nearly steal the show from the two leads.  Great set and costume design, plus powerful performances.  I just wouldn't put myself in the position of being treated like dirt by a fashion designer just to get ahead in my career.  But that's just me.  You can't help but root for Anne Hathaway. <br />
B0002ZDVF4|4.0|This is a fun film, Damon does a great job, the plot line makes sense (in a spy novel sort of way), and the action scenes are great.  It's a nice follow-up to the first Bourne film.  But it has NOTHING to do with the Ludlum book of the same name.  Ludlum's book is all about Chinese politics, Hong Kong chase scenes, and Bourne's wife and psychiatrist.  The movie is a completely different story about Germany, Russia, and a CIA mole.
B000089RVR|5.0|I have been a big fan of Dido's music since the first time I heard her lush vocals on Faithless' first album. Her first cd \\"No Angel\\" was good, a bit predictable and often bland but still quite good. Dido definitely has a distinct voice that sets her apart from most of her counterparts nowadays. She may have a limited range but she knows it and doesn't try to hit the high notes like a lot of singers do.<br /><br />\\"Life For Rent\\" is Dido's second album. I definitely felt the material was much stronger than the songs on her first album both lyrically and musically. Her songs take on a more lush, intimate sound courtesy of the occasional acoustic guitar. I feel like I am in a studio watching Dido perform when I listen to \\"Life for Rent\\". The title track is my favorite song because I often relate to her lyrics. Initially I wasn't too wild about the first single \\"White Flag\\" but after hearing it several times on the radio when it first came out, the song eventually grew on me. The songs on the album tends to sound eerily similiar which is a minor flaw but I didn't mind it. I am just glad that there was no \\"Thank You\\" pt 2 on the cd. Overall this is a nice cd to listen to in the morning with a steaming hot cup of coffee and a scone or two, nice mellow music to chill out to.
B00005JPG1|5.0|<br />**May Contain Spoiler** <br /> <br />I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in which I didn't want to miss a single frame. \\"Zodiac\\", an excellent film by director David Fincher fills that bill however. The movie is gripping and full of tension from start to finish even though the story of the infamous \\"Zodiac\\" killer of northern California is well known to many of us who lived through it. It is a completely fascinating crime drama, one which I think actually surpasses Fincher's noted \\"Se7en\\" in quality. <br /> <br />For those who are unfamiliar with the story, this strange killer terrorized northern California during the 70's and late 60's and relied on cryptology as well as astrological symbols to further his reign of terror. Completely unrelated to another \\"Zodiac\\" killer who used similar astrological codes and stalked the New York City area in the early 90's, the story of the California \\"Zodiac\\" has found it's way into the annals of crime lore, possibly ranking up with such stories as the \\"Black Dahlia\\", or \\"Jack the Ripper\\" as one of the most noted unsolved crime mysteries to date. <br /> <br />\\"Zodiac\\" captures the look and feel of late 60's and early 70's San Francisco and Northern California, an era of the Patty Hearst kidnapping, \\"free love\\" and Ronald Reagen as California governor. As a \\"period piece\\", the film is remarkably authentic, capturing all aspects of that era down to the famous giant \\"smiles\\" on the now defunct PSA (Pacific Southern Airlines) airplanes. It \\"looked\\" as if it actually had been made during the time period in which it was set, rather than almost 30 years later. The cinematography is excellent throughout and there are two particularly breathtaking shots in the movie, one of the valley around Modesto, California at night and another taken from the top of the Golden Gate bridge. <br /> <br />\\"Zodiac\\" in fact reminded me in both look, feel and attention to detail of another great thriller about the same era in US history, (albeit a political thriller in that case) the great \\"All The President's Men\\", by Alan Pakula. I found the \\"Golden Gate Bridge\\" shot in this movie to be very reminiscent of the famous shot taken from the top of the Library of Congress in Pakula's thriller and the entire movie details a similarly intense, relentless quest for the truth as in \\"All The President's Men\\". <br /> <br />Fincher keeps the action taut, with a sense of underlying danger permeating the entire movie. While one might quibble with a few scenes here and there (for example, one scene where a woman and her baby are kidnapped by the Zodiac is never fully developed or it's outcome fully explained) the movie is particularly thorough in detailing the story. The acting is universally excellent throughout the film and Robert Downey Jr. is particularly good, playing a quirky, alcoholic reporter who faces the same type of demons that Downey himself apparently faced earlier in his life. <br /> <br />One of the better crime dramas in recent years, I would highly recommend this film.  <br />
B00004D3C1|4.0|Heavy and not to be taken too seriously.  Definetly LA stoner music. If you want bludgeoning sledgehammer head injury music see: Electric Wizard, Sleep, Khanate, Bongzilla, Grief to name just a few.  This band is another great Sabbath prototype with a flair for the 70's. Throw in some Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, and tons of sabbath with accesible vocals and you have Fu Manchu. Kyuss contempories, but not quite as good, this is still great to jam to. Hell on Wheels is awesome.  BUY THIS.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE....UNFORTUNATELY IT CONFIRMS MY BELIEFS OF HOLLYWOOD... THE ACADEMY VOTES FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH QUALITY.  OH WELL....IT WAS STRANGE TO LAUGH AT MOMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSE TO BE HORRIFYING.....BUT AFTER EVERYONE GETS THEIR BRAINS BLOWN OUT CONSTANTLY, IT BECOMES SO CORNY!!

B00001OH7N|5.0|In November 1970, David Bowie released his 3rd studio album and the promise that showed on the previous year's release was brought to fullfillment on 'The Man Who Sold the World'. Tales of madness, the occult, science fiction, maniac Vietnam vets and a race of superhumans fill this bizarre masterpiece of sonic indulgence. Some have commented on this record being David's heavy metal piece and in some parts the guitars are very heavy for 1970 (excepting of course Zep, Purple and the Sabs), but in many ways it is typical early Bowie record, especially lyrically. The Spiders from Mars make their debut here (with producer Tony Visconti handling the bass chores). Mick Ronson was the actual session leader on these recordings as newlywed Bowie was \\"preoccupied\\". Maybe that was the reason for the overabundance of heavy rock but much of Bowie's later work would be heavy as well. Favorites include the epic \\"Width of a Circle\\", an alltime favorite of mine which incorporates many of Bowie's early influences including legendary occultist Aleister Crowley. \\"All the Madmen\\" which explores the nature of insanity and touches on David's own troubled psyche while sympathizing with the plight of his half brother Terry. \\"Savoir Machine\\" and \\"Circle\\" explore the nature of false leadership and gods (\\"You can't stake your lives...\\"). \\"Running Gun Blues\\" explores the psychosis of war and its impact on soldiers who can't shut it down while back home. Both \\"After All\\" and \\"The Supermen\\" explore the ideas of Nietzsche and possibly Lovecraft describing a race aliens who resemble humans but are superior. Many of these will continue in future albums, especially 'Ziggy'. The most famous song on an album of non-hits is undoubtably the title track and it is a brilliant piece of work which stands up to the best of Bowie. A young man in a fragile state of mind? A blissfully ignorant hippie youth? A genius flaunting what was exceptable in rock music? Probably a little of all three which would show its first full bloom on this strange, troubling but brilliant record.
1400079179|5.0|This completely fabulous book was a quick read and I could not put it down.  I was done with it in a day! Dan Brown is the only author I have found so far to make the topics propounded in his novel fast and fun and even exciting at times. The issues and concepts that Dan Brown writes about have been around for years, but only in boring, tedious lengthy treatises that few people other than theological intellectuals would ever delve into. I find the background of christian symbolism fascinating. Some say the writing style and the plot was predictable and therefore unworthy, but if I'm reading for fun, I want a fast, easy read with a structure that IS predicable so I can zip through the book. Dan Brown does this in a very amusing style. I have to admit, I'm not one much for the likes of Tom Clancy style novels, but the DaVinci code successfully blended it together for me. I liked both the book and the movie.<br /><br />And the very most important part of the novel was the bringing up the issue of Mother God who was suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church for about 1500 years. I like the way he brought up that issue because I do believe that there will be a resurgence of worship of Her in the near future as more feminism and equality creeps back into religion. Plus, I believe we are becoming a much more spiritual society with people having their own personal encounters with Mother Goddess via increased personal visions, healings and more women entering into the clergy as ministers, pastors, priestesses, etc., so this book is definitely a prelude to that. And, if it is as people are predicting, an entry of the world into and age of greater world peace, then Mother God is certainly leading that focus for the future.<br /><br />For a great book on Mother God, see the one written by Sylvia Browne, she does a terrific job of discussing Her.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This film is based on the true story of John Merrick, a carnival sideshow freak known as \\"The Elephant Man\\" Anthony Hopkins stars as Dr. Treves, the physcian go shows John Merrick humanity & John Hurt stars in the title role. It's one of the most passionate & depressing movies of all time, a powerful & sad character study, a masterpiece that is a must see. The story of a man who got to live as a human being after being treated like an animal.
B00000IL26|5.0|This album has come as a bit of a shock. The shock isn't from how good this album is (and it is very good). The shock - the shame even - is that I've been going around all these years calling myself a jazz lover without ever even hearing it, talk less about having it in my collection.<br /><br />But I got lucky. You know how it is. You buy a CD or express an interest in one and amazon.com very helpfully suggest others that you might enjoy. That is how I came across this classic beauty. I read a few reviews, they all seemed to be saying great things and so I jumped right in.<br /><br />Lee Morgan is a great trumpeter but it's not just the improvisation and sheer craftsmanship of he and all concerned here (Joe Henderson on tenor saxophone, Barry Harris on piano, Bob Cranshaw on bass and Billy Higgins on drums) that I find mind-blowing; it's that Lee Morgan is such an incredible songwriter. The title track beings to mind phrases like \\"Herbie Hancock\\", \\"Watermelon Man\\" and \\"bandwagon\\" but that might be a bit too harsh. It's still a very enjoyable tune in its own right.<br /><br />Morgan writes all six of the songs on this album and while I don't know much about the technical jargon involved, on \\"Totem Pole\\", just to take one example, the way the beat and tempo keep changing during the song keep me going back to it again and again (track #6 is actually an alternate take of this song).<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me how music recorded almost half a century ago - this one was recorded in 1963 - still sounds so fresh and so original today. Maybe it's the mastering by Rudy Van Gelder but the sound is clear, crisp and practically jumps out of the speakers. This is my kind of jazz; very clever but still very accessible. I love it!

B00000DGUY|3.0|While this was as good a compilation of Dire Straits as you could find for a time, the recent \\"[[ASIN:B000BI0WOA Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler]]\\" ups the ante for two reasons. First and foremost, on that 2-disc collection, the Dire Straits songs are included in their full length versions (edited versions are here for \\"Money For Nothing\\" in particular), and the live cuts - especially \\"Love Over Gold\\" - are replaced with studio versions. Since Dire Straits were always a product of studio perfections and the belief that great things last longer than 4 minutes, losing almost half of \\"Money For Nothing\\" just isn't acceptable.<br /><br />Secondly, the \\"Private Investigations\\" set has its second disc devoted to the best of Mark Knopfler's solo career. Since that was madly uneven, it beats his spotty solo albums. Here, \\"Local Hero\\" is the only solo track,  and again in a live version.<br /><br />While I have long been a fan of Dire Straits (\\"Love Over Gold\\" and \\"Brothers In Arms\\" were the two CD's I often used to show off - gawd I'm Getting Old - the brand new CD player and its spanking new technology), \\"Sultans Of Swing - The Very Best Of\\" under represents the band. On the other hand, \\"Private Investigations\\" leaves off \\"Heavy Fuel\\" and the goofy \\"Twisting By The Pool.\\" That was the first time Knopfler showed off his sense of humor prior to (the also missing) \\"Industrial Disease.\\" (\\"Private Investiagtions\\" also completely ignores the \\"Communique\\" album).<br /><br />I have a few personal favorites here. The shock of hearing \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" during the period of all things Clash or Sex Pistols has never worn off. As a calling card of Mark Knofler as new guitar hero, it remains very hard to beat. The Noir detective tale of \\"Private Investigations\\" has long affected me, as has the call for understanding of \\"Brothers In Arms.\\" My personal favorite missing songs are \\"Skateaway\\" and \\"The Bug.\\" But since they appear on neither collection, maybe Knopfler isn't too keen on them, either.<br /><br />So while you may finds yourself drawn to the more expansive collection, if you're a casual listener, \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" will do ok. Just be aware that the two songs you probably most want here are trimmed from their LP versions. If you are really interested in them, starting with the debut album or the still incredible \\"Brothers In Arms\\" is an even better bet than this particular Dire Straits best of.n on them, either.

6305428522|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. I generally have to be \\"in the mood\\" for a particular film, but I will always sit down and watch this one. It seems strange today in this post-Watergate era to believe it could have been considered scandalous at one time for quiz shows to be rigged. For that matter, today, I doubt many people would be surprised if you told them the Congressional hearings on the quiz shows were rigged. That is the level to which our cynicism has progressed. At any rate, this film excels on many levels. To begin with, the cast and performances are just excellent. Turturro excels as the completely unlikeable walking encyclopedia, Herb Stempel. He so badly wants to be admired and successful, but he is just SO unlikeable he doesn't realize that he IS unlikeable. His long-suffering wife played by Johann Carlo sees Herb's every flaw yet loves him anyway. In this he is truly lucky, but he just doesn't see it. Besides his Jewish heritage, Stempel seems to have cluelessness in common with Robert Morrow's Richard Goodwin. Goodwin's character is center stage throughout this movie, and he is played as an exceedingly complex character. First in his class at Harvard, he has brains but lacks the worldliness to see from the beginning that corporate America's Goliath will never be taken down by his version of David and his sling shot of a subpoena. Long before Big Pharma got so big, the fix was already in.<br /><br />In this sense, Goodwin is the personification of the wide-eyed idealist. He still believes if you just present the truth to the public the correct outcome is inevitable. Finally you have Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Dorn, possibly the most tragic figure in all of this. He goes in to try out for one of NBC's quiz shows with the best of intentions, and  ultimately trades his integrity for fame and fortune, although reluctantly at first. Van Dorn at first enjoys the attention and the money, but when Goodwin shows up at his door with a host of questions about the honesty of the quiz shows he seems to reawaken Van Dorn's conscience, and he slowly disintegrates into a pile of nerves who even goes out of his way to avoid the host of admirers he once welcomed. He seems relieved to indict himself before Congress and the nation, but pays a heavy price for his confession. Rounding out the cast is the excellent Paul Scofield as Mark Van Dorn, Charles' father. He is another wide-eyed idealist, and a tall shadow in which Charles has had to dwell until \\"21\\" comes along. The master stroke in this film is the cameo by Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhome, an executive with Geritol, the sponsor of \\"21\\". His short conversation with Richard Goodwin pretty much lays out the ugly truth of the situation - People do tune in to watch the money, and the same end could be accomplished by merely making the questions easier. He also mentions that the public has a short memory but corporations do not, and is thus confident that the NBC employees who rigged the show will never implicate anyone higher than themselves at any hearing. This fictional composite character is right at every turn, and the dishonored NBC employees even return to TV in the 60's with an even bigger hit - \\"The Joker's Wild\\" - something that would have never happened if they hadn't been willing to be the fall guys.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend this film. You'll probably get something further out of it each time you watch it.of questions about the honesty of the quiz shows he seems to reawaken Van Dorn's conscience, and he slowly disintegrates into a pile of nerves who even goes out of his way to avoid the host of admirers he once welcomed.

Since that was madly uneven, it beats his spotty solo albums. Here, \\"Local Hero\\" is the only changed over to its album version. Great songs like \\"Boom Like That\\" or \\"Sailing To Philadelphia\\" are as good as his best Dire Straits work, and a track from his duets album with Emmylou Harris is included. All are really worth hearing.<br /><br />While I have long been a fan of Dire Straits (\\"Love Over Gold\\" and \\"Brothers In Arms\\" were the two CD's I often used to show off - gawd I'm Getting Old - my brand new CD player and its spanking new technology), \\"Private Investigations\\" leaves off \\"Heavy Fuel\\" and the goofy \\"Twisting By The Pool.\\" (That was the first time Knopfler showed off his sense of humor prior to the also missing \\"Industrial Disease.\\") On the other hand \\"Sultans Of Swing - The Very Best Of\\" under represented the band. \\"Private Investiagtions\\" also completely ignores the \\"Communique\\" album, and \\"Lady Writer\\" is essential Dire Straits in my opinion.<br /><br />I have a few personal favorites here. The shock of hearing \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" during the period of all things Clash or Sex Pistols has never worn off. As a calling card of Mark Knofler as new guitar hero, it remains very hard to beat. The Noir detective tale of \\"Private Investigations\\" has long affected me, as has the call for understanding of \\"Brothers In Arms.\\" My personal favorite missing songs are \\"Skateaway\\" and \\"The Bug.\\" But since they appear on neither collection, maybe Knopfler isn't too keen on them, either.<br /><br />So while you may finds yourself drawn to this more expansive collection, if you're a casual listener, \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" will do ok. If you are really interested in them, starting with the debut album or the still incredible \\"Brothers In Arms\\" both an even better bet than this particular Dire Straits best of.<br /><br />PS - it's time to retire the floating guitar in the clouds image already!ard to beat.

0143034901|5.0|This book is so good is so many ways.  It's the story of a book that seems to be the last copy that exists.  When the life of the person who has the book mimics the story within the book it gets real interesting.  I liked the variety of characters and their development.  I do understand why other reviewers did not like how it ends but I give it 5 stars because it reads nicely, held my interest, and was a very different story to come across.  This is a very enjoyable read.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This movie is great. I would recommend it to everyone. It is a touching ending to perhaps one of the greatest, most beloved characters of our time! Check it out, you will love it!!!!!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just a great movie for fans of the show Firefly.  You do not have to have seen the show to enjoy the movie, but having that as background will increase comprehension and entertainment levels.  The writing is crisp and sharp.  The cast is very much at home with their characters.  The plot sizzles along nicely, never dragging at all.  A whole lot of fun here to enjoy.  Get this movie.  Better yet, get this movie and the series dvd set.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This is Whitney's first mega-hit album release. There are multiple hits on this album and if you're into her soothing ballads, then this is definitely one you need to add to your collection. The album starts off with \\"You Give Good Love\\", which was her first release that set off the beginning of her career. The song is a nice blend of balladry and sweet lyrics, particularly for those into setting romantic dinner moods. \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\" is a song that even non-Whitney fans are familiar with, and the song has been used as theme songs for many charity organizations and TV shows for its sentimental lyrics and message. Teddy Pendergrass lends his classic voice for \\"Hold Me (In Your Arms)\\", which is another great ballad for setting the romantic mood. The album's fill of ballads doesn't stop there, \\"All At Once\\" being another nice ballad to set a smooth tone for the night. This is also an album that you can listen to without worrying about her horrific image of recent times, since all songs will likely take you back a couple of decades when she was considered one of the more clean-cut artists of her generation.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|I liked \\"Love is Space\\" but I like this much better.  I couldn't use  the former for Yoga because it didn't fit a practice by following along with the sequencing of the asanas.  Dakshina is great for yoga and although it is only an hour long it is good for my short practice days.   Also when I am sad about something I want to go to my mat with this cd because it calms and soothes me and brings me to a quiet place.  I love the rawness of her voice and soul.  Peace to you and me.
1400031354|4.0|In TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE the wonderful sequel to THE NO.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY, Mma Ramotswe, the strong, feisty, proud but compassionate lady detective (the only in Botswana, maybe Africa) faces new challenges both in her life and in her work.  Upon her engagement to the kind, reliable mechanic, Mr. J.L.B Matekoni, she ponders a possible move, negotiates the purchase of her engagement ring (diamond, of course!) and suddenly finds herself a new mother of two children.  She is also called upon by an American mother to resolve the mystery of her son, who disappeared in the desolate Kalahari Plains many years ago, and track the modern, 'wayward' wife of a honest butcher.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, this book is not your typical \\"who dun it\\" detective story- in fact, the detective element figures in this story even less than in the first novel.  Mma Ramotswe only solves two cases- actually, she solves only one, as the other is solved by her able, newly promoted Assistant, Mma Makutsi.  Rather, the novel focuses on developing solid characters (apart from Mma Ramotswe, we get much more insight in this novel into the characters of Mr. J.L.B Matekoni and Mma Makutsi) and highlights life in Botswana and the views of its proud people.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor, this book has more of a focus on ex-pats and development workers, which I found interesting as an ex-pat development worker in Africa.  Mma Ramotswe comments that Ex-pats often do not have good manners (ie, would shake with one hand, leaving the other hand free for 'mischievous activities') and do not understand simple, obvious issues such as the fact that the dead are always with us.  Ex-pat development workers, although well-meaning, are always coming up with bizarre, idealistic theories and schemes.  They are always giving advice, always trying 'to change the world.' But, as Mma Ramotswe says, vegetables just were not meant to be grown in the Kalahari desert!  Furthermore, \\"Africa needs its own solutions.\\"<br /><br />This novel also focuses on moral issues:  Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B Matekoni both lament the loss of 'the Old Botswana morality' which promotes hard work and a respect for elders.  Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi struggle with moral questions such as, does the end justify the means? Ie, is it okay to lie, manipulate and blackmail to get a desired, even just, result? The novel ends on a beautiful note, suggesting that in order to heal after loss, compassion, understanding and reconciliation maybe more important than strict justice.his novel also focuses on moral issues:  Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B Matekoni both lament the loss of 'the Old Botswana morality' which promotes hard work and a respect for elders.

B000H305U0|3.0|While there are a couple of cuts that rate high marks,  (My Love and What Goes Around) this collection has a whining sound that lacks an appeal to a wider market. However, he is on his way to a sound that will be a benchmark in modern music if he can continue to develop more depth in his writing both musically and in the (spoken) word.
B0001I55OC|2.0|Ok so its not as good as the book... what movie is?  So that said, the movie is somewhat well shot with good attention to detail as far as the year 1357 is concerned.  The acting is something to be desired overall.  The conflicts are somewhat sudden and seem overly complicated.  This movie is forgettable, in that once you finish watching it you kinda wake up, shake your head and find out whats for dinner.  Oh and as far as the character David Stern... um all I could think of was \\"damn the man, save the empire.\\"
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Cursed are those unfortunate souls who decide to experience the original version of something before experiencing the remake, be it an adaptation of a novel or, in the case of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED, a remake of a previous masterpiece.  That masterpiece was 2002's MOU GAAN DOU, or INFERNAL AFFAIRS, directed by Lau Wai Keung and Mak Siu Fai.  The premise of the two films is the same, but the styles of the respective films are vastly different.  I am one of the unfortunate souls who watched INFERNAL AFFAIRS long before THE DEPARTED came about; naturally I could not avoid constantly comparing between the two, which gives me a rather biased opinion.  However, as a lone film rather than a remake of INFERNAL AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTED is truly stellar, and probably Scorsese's best effort since his masterwork, GOODFELLAS.    The plot is delicious: in the slums of Boston, one cop (Matt Damon) is a mole within the police force, working for criminal \\"rock star\\" Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), while another (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a mole within Costello's gang of thugs, working for the police force.  Their objectives, however are the same: find the mole and smoke him out.  Damon's character has high aspirations, and a very successful relationship with a police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga).  DiCaprio's character is gradually drawn deeper and deeper into the blackness of the criminal underworld, and begins to fear that he can never return.  His is the character the audience really sympathizes with, the character who fights to do what's right no matter what, but who seemingly cannot win.  After all, when you lead a double life so convoluted, how do you decide which side is the reality and which side is the facade?    As THE DEPARTED is a Martin Scorsese picture, it should go without saying that the acting is great, but it goes beyond that: it's exquisite.  Matt Damon, in his first role as a villain, is supremely sleazy, more and more so as he becomes increasingly corrupt.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a far more attractive role in a far more attractive fashion, that of a tormented man with nothing to lose who has no choice but to continue fighting the good fight until his end.  DiCaprio, who could easily have been dismissed as just another pretty face when he first appeared in the late 90s, has come a long way since, exercising his dramatic chops over the years until finally peaking with his marvelously sympathetic performance in THE DEPARTED.  Aging Martin Sheen, surprisingly tough Alan Baldwin, and impressively rude Mark Wahlberg head up a fine supporting cast.  The star who shines the brightest, though, is no surprise.  Jack Nicholson's performance is a career highlight, ranking alongside his knockout performances in classics like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and THE SHINING.  Nicholson burns with intensity, and his performance is the very definition of \\"devilish\\" (there is a sumptuous scene in which Nicholson's character attends an opera, during which the lighting bathes him in a hellish shade of red, and in which he could easily be mistaken for Satan himself).    Martin Scorsese is as much of a star as any of those on-screen.  He's at his finest in this film, using some new techniques while producing some moments that are pure Scorsese (namely a few sudden outbursts of violence a la GOODFELLAS or CASINO, and a breathtaking scene in which a character is thrown to his death from a rooftop).  Through the picture, Scorsese uses swirling camera angles and randomly increases the volume of certain things, such as background voices or songs, only to cease those sounds abruptly and cut to something new.  This rapidfire, nauseous editing style adds a certain surreality to the film that brings to mind shady old crime classics starring Humphrey Bogart, like THE MALTESE FALCON or THE BIG SLEEP, or even DARK PASSAGE.    Toss in a great soundtrack (including a delightful theme by the Boston-based heavy punk group Dropkick Murphys and songs by The Rolling Stones and Roger Waters) and a screenplay by William Monahan that recalls Greek tragedy and includes dialogue destined to become classic, and you have one hell of a film.  THE DEPARTED is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and a whopping achievement for Scorsese, as well as his best picture since GOODFELLAS way back in '90.  The question of superiority between THE DEPARTED and INFERNAL AFFAIRS is easily solved: THE DEPARTED is, hands down, the better film.  Still, it doesn't quite have the kick that China's INFERNAL AFFAIRS had, and the ending of America's DEPARTED adds considerably more closure than that of AFFAIRS.  Yet although justice is, more or less, served at THE DEPARTED's end, it still ends on a relatively sour note.  For the moviegoer, however, that's cause for joy, because as Martin Scorsese has proved again and again, those films without happy endings are often the finest.
B0000029AP|5.0|Withstands the passage of time. Brings back memories of College days. Much simpler times.... <br /> <br />Just great meaty rock and roll. <br /> <br />
B000M341QE|3.0|Will somebody please tell me what all the fuss is about?<br /><br />Yes, Marty was due for a ton of things he should have won for in the past. Yes, DiCaprio gives a damn fine performance here. But BEST picture?<br /><br />Surely not.<br /><br />This is a film that is nicely done. It is well made. Outside of Marky-Mark, who is way over the top in his role, there's not really a weak link in the cast (though Nicholsen once again pretty much plays himself). I just don't see what sets this one apart.<br /><br />I'm kind of glad I don't have a vote for best picture. This year was thin on good movies, much less great ones. The Departed is a B, maybe a B+ movie at best. Great?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Which brings me to what is probably my biggest critique of the film: you better have a Hamlet on your hands if your gonna be littering the stage with bodies at the end. There is no prince of Denmark here--just a bunch of blood and bagpipes.
B00006AW2M|4.0|The funny thing about ALL the reviews, for all the different versions, (probably because nobody has the album anymore, and you can't play a CD at 78) is that at the end of side one, very slowed down, is a verse of \\"Merry Christmas\\". You have to speed it up to really hear it. Just some of the lost fun of the vinyl albums.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Not your typical thriller (where are the car chases..).<br /><br />Lord of War is constructed like a documentary with a plot.<br /><br />Cage is excellent, so is the screenplay.<br /><br />The movie not-so-subtly speaks against war, arm dealings, and developed countries making quick buck on misery of genocide and civil wars while at the same time hypocriticaly imposing embargos, sanctions, etc.<br /><br />Be prepared for strong language, a lot of violence and sexuality - all of which give really gritty surface to the otherwise sleek story.<br /><br />Many quotable one-liners and fast pace make it solid entertainment, if you can call it this thought-provoking drama.
B00005JO20|4.0|This movie is a gem.  Peter Jackson has demonstrated some fine work through this remake.  I've seen alot of remakes that just don't seem to get any better and that usually end up being worse than the original, not kong.  The first quarter or so of the movie is kind of too long for what it's trying to accomplish.  You know what the movie is about, a giant ape, don't spend to much time fleshing out insignificant's.  Unlike Titanic this film fails to keep you interested thru much of the first part.  Some how the movie goes from 0 to 150 in like a few seconds because once the crew hit skull island then the movie takes off.  Action seen after action seen and full use of the digital animation era.  Of course there are flaws in the film, but you have to remember this is a giant ape running lose and forget about them.  The movie left me shaking my head in disbelief at times, like the flailing of the actress (girl shoulda had wiplash).  All and all the movie has enough \\"it\\" to make it great.  It definitly is a watch, and although I didn't see it in a theatre, the special effects are so realistic and thrilling i'm sure it was awesome.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|The concept of Stranger than Fiction was admittedly enchanting.  It evokes the kind of cleverness you'd get from a Charlie Kaufman flick (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).  However, unlike those movies, by the second half of the film, the plot device seems to confuse the film thematically. <br />The plot centers (most of the time) on Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) who one day wakes up hearing the voice of a narrator, Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) in his head.  This is the source of most of comedy in the movie, with Ferrell's unabashed style fitting in perfectly in situations where he's making a fool of himself in public confronting his narrator. <br />But, unfortunately, that's about as much as the plot device does for the movie.  As the plot progresses, the movie becomes thematically convoluted as the movie can't decide whether to focus on Ferrell's actions or Thompson's.  Is this movie about Ferrell's actions in light of his imminent death?  Or is it about the morality of Thompson's choice of killing a novel character who happens to be real?  And ultimately, the movie fails to really pound any of these themes home - after watching the movie, it feels like a speaker, going up to the podium, pointing his finger in the air as if he had something brilliant to say, but instead walks away silent, tail between his legs. <br />Thematic confusion aside, the movie does bring out a decent performance out of Ferrell, who shows he can do more than just being loud and unabashed, as his resume might suggest.  But the real gem is the stellar performance out of Emma Thompson, who wonderfully portrays the role of neurotic literist.  With her, she brings the refreshingly subtle, dialogue-driven British-style humor that works fantastically opposite Ferrell's situational comedic style. <br />All-in-all, an entertaining flick to catch on TV, or to rent, but nothing groundbreaking as the clever plot device turns out to be less novel and more gimmick.
B000HA4WT8|1.0|I was looking for decent drift action, and after watching it, I'm disappointed. <br />Story line is mediocre, but this is ok, I wasn't expecting anything. <br />All the driving actions in this movie are also mediocre, and this disappointed me.  \\"drift\\" and \\"tail-slide\\" mean different things, to some people.

B000H305U0|5.0|Indeed it is.  Topping the Billboard Hot 100 proved to be a simple accomplishment for Justin Timberlake, who happens to be sitting on an audible goldmine.  FutureSex / LoveSounds is a mix of sounds proven to get the club moving and set the mood (no pun intended).    Building from sounds of the past and present, Timberlake, along with producers Timberland and Danjahands, has fashioned a successful CD into which he has put a lot of himself.  He wrote the lyrics, beatboxed, and even played the piano on the last track, \\"Another Song\\".    Each track stands on its own, yet fits very well into the grand scheme of the album.  On the first listen, it might be hard for one to tell whether Justin meant for \\"Sexy Ladies\\" to sound like an actual song or an interlude between the tracks \\"SexyBack\\" and \\"My Love\\".  Despite this minor confusion that might be brought on by the mere slow pacing of \\"Sexy Ladies,\\" the album actually moves quite quickly.  Of my favorites is \\"LoveStoned,\\" which infuses the JT trademark beatbox with bass and symphony, accompanied with the lyric \\"I'm love stoned and I could swear/That she knows\\".  Though I do tend to lean towards a few songs on the album, I do feel that Timberlake has done well by refraining from the use of too many tasteless lyrics.    With that having been said, JT's sophomore effort is a very grand maturation.  In fact, the only transposition (in terms of the actual sound) to be found on FutureSex / LoveSounds from Justified is \\"Cry Me a River,\\" which would clearly fit in on either album.    Some might be disappointed with the sheer length of a few songs on this album.  \\"What Goes Around...\\" reaches roughly 7:28 on the album, which has been cut down drastically for radio play (and which may be a reason it only stayed on the #1 spot of the Top 100 for a week [so far]).  I do not mean to detract from the rest of the album, because this is clearly a strong effort by Justin Timberlake, who seemes poised to conquer mainstream music with this collection of songs.    - Fh
B000002J1M|5.0|It's awesome from back to front, especially for a group of 21 year olds.  What do we get today from groups who's members are that age or even older?  California accented lyrics that whine about their jobs at Taco Bell that belong in movies like American Pie?  You have to consider how young these guys were along with the restrictions of their budgets and not having a super studio to record in.  With what they did have, they made the most of it with this album, hands down.   <br /> <br />Also consider who young Genesis were up against...ELP's Pictures At An Exhibition, Yes' Close To The Edge and Floyd fixing to give us their opus, Dark Side Of The Moon.  No doubt these folks ran in similar circles and knew what their slightly older more experienced pals in the same field were up to before the rest of us did.  Genesis were freshmen competing in a field full of graduates and they caught up with amazing speed with this album.   <br /> <br />You can also tell that Gabriel's grateful by making the most of it all giving it a thousand percent while maintaining the image of being a working class art-house average Joe and not getting sucked into the super-ego trappings that Keith Emerson or Jon Anderson possessed.  Call him the Ozzy or Springsteen of English Prog, if you will.  The man put forth immeasurable effort to put on a show and milk it for all he can.  He still continues that hard working ethic to this very day.   <br /> <br />Phil Collins does just as well here too.  Forget that he wrote \\"One More Night\\" and \\"Do You Remember\\" years later.  He busted his butt on this album big time.   <br /> <br />The whole group shines with the low man Rutherford holding down the fort to keep Banks, Gabriel, Collins and Hackett from heading too far off into space.  <br /> <br />The songs brim with imagery, color and warmth from back to front where it plateaus with Supper's Ready's strangely titled \\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs\\"  where Gabriel sings his heart and guts out.    <br /> <br />Of course, this album doesn't have the radio friendly sound of prog that Yes and Floyd possessed at the time and if you're just getting into Yes or ELP or Floyd, you might want to hold off on Foxtrot.   <br /> <br />But if you've digested those three groups while still holding their songs dear with glowing admiration, then go ahead, dive on in and swim in Foxtrot's mix of pop, rock, dead stop-and-start sound orgies.   <br /> <br />If you're not yet a fan of Peter Gabriel, this album will see to it that you will be.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed <br /> <br />The Departed is the type of film where people walking out the theater will feel as if they have embraced a long lost friend.  After The Aviator, few knew what direction Martin Scorsese would be heading in.  Although it was a superb film worthy of its many Oscar nominations, many were bewildered to how loosely it resembled anything Mr. Scorsese had put on screen.  Fans need not panic.  Scorsese has returned to his roots of mobs and violence in his new film.  And what a return it is! <br /> <br />The Departed scores big on almost every possible level.  Let's begin with the cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg all perform magnificent in their roles.   It's almost surreal having all these actors together for one film.  Not satisfied...want more?  Toss in Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin into the mix.  Both actors obtain small roles but deliver on screen monumental results. <br /> <br />Discovering the plot is half the fun, so not much should be given away.  Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) has infiltrated Frank Costello's (Nicholson) Iris mob.  Not an easy task when one realizes the bloody and deranged nature of Costello's boys.   <br /> <br />The Massachusetts State Police should be more careful as well because one of Costello's men, Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), has penetrated the police force.  Two rats...one nasty result. <br /> <br />Jack Nicholson continues to prove why he is still one of the best actors in the business.  Mr. Nicholson chews and devours every scene he is in.  His character, Costello, is psychotic and fascinating.  It's a character made of pure evil, yet you can't get enough of.  One can easily tell from Nicholson's eyes that he is relishing into his character and loving every minute of it.  We too can't help but share the same excitement. <br /> <br />It's important to note that The Departed is the American version of Hong Kong's beloved masterpiece Infernal Affairs.  It seems like every time an American remake of a foreign classic comes out, it stinks to high heaven.  For some reason American remake's never get it right.  We are currently witnessing this  with our lousy remakes of Japanese horror films.  The Departed reminds us that remakes can be done well and can be done right.  A remake from a foreign film hasn't been this good since Christopher Nolan's Insomnia. <br /> <br />In all of its 151 minutes, The Departed is lavished with brutal violence and contains pervasive use of colorful words.  It's crucial to understand why this film should not be slandered for its persistent use of violence.  What separates this violent feature from other ferocious films such as Crank, is that The Departed handles its violent nature with maturity.  It demands the language and violence necessary to the environment of characters we have been introduced too.  It is treated with maturity and therefore, elevated to an art form.  Examples like Crank are dumb and merely throws in violence just for the sake of violence.  A \\"trick\\" conveyed simply for an, \\"Awesome!\\" or \\"Cool!\\" factor, not for purpose.  In reality, the audience is the only one getting bamboozled.  Many have walked out of The Departed recognizing it as a violent film, yet are not disgusted by it.  It is because it is handled with maturity.  It is much in the same metaphor as a nude art painting in comparison with porn. <br /> <br />The Departed is a brilliant film which boasts a triumph return to Martin Scorsese's roots.  A gorgeous display of cinematography by Michael Ballhaus, a slick cool acoustic guitar score by Howard Shore, and magnificent acting all-around by some of the best in Hollywood make The Departed one of the best films of the year.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|I cannot fathom how this completely pointless drivel wins any awards or gets so much hype. The plot is 100% worthless with basically cell phones and text messaging going off for two hours between a bunch of cops and informants trying to figure each other out with NO point or reason for any of it.   <br /> <br />The problem is that there is absolutely NO way the real police would work like this. It is was so convoluded and contrived that it became worth laughing at about halfway through. The acting was obnoxious with the way over-done tough guy mafia BS and Jack Nicholson trying to play Jack Torrence from the Shining albeit in a mob role.  The last 15 minutes features about 25 gunshots to the heads of like 25 different people with B horror movie type blood spatters.  It was truly funny and if Scorsese meant for this to be serious then he needs to check into a mental hospital or double his prescriptions.  I laughed outloud at the end.... you will to unless your IQ has a decimal in front of it and you actually think this film had some point. <br /> <br />I thought low-budget horror movies had dumb plots with idiot characters. This takes the cake by a longshot and had as much sense as Friday the 13th part 74 if you knw what I mean. <br /> <br />Its amazing that Scorsese can make something as great as Goodfellas and then churns out this abhorrent garbage. Dont waste your life.... I was looking for a butter-knife to gouge my eyes out with so it would HURT more than a sharp knife since the pain I was feeling needed to be countered by tearing out my own eyes.  Im convinced that if you like this movie and actually seriously think it has value then you have several undiagnosed mental problems. <br /> <br />Go ahead, watch it.... even buy it..... you will be suing Hollywood for molestation offenses.  I warned you!
B00007LTIA|3.0|I just love &#34;The Revealling Science of God&#34; A Yes classic. Ritual has a great ending section, the intro is less interesting.  The Remembering offers good moments & pure delight but it's not a classic.  The Ancient is boring, without any musical structure. I have listen to it hundred of time and never really get in...there's a small passage   with classical guitar that I like, but the rest is just experimentation without any emotions in it.  Also, I think that the rythm section, with Squire and White is quite less impressive that the Bruford - Squire duo (Like Close to the Edge)  The sound of the band is not as sharp as previous recording. Overall, quite good but for sure not as memorable as &#34;Close to the Edge&#34;
B000002JSP|2.0|John Paul Jones is a musical genius on his own and was with Zeppelin too, but the sound he gave to the band in this particular album is clearly out of step with the band. I don't know if a change of style was needed but the results are spotty despite the usual skills of everybody involved, being Pagey the one less brilliant, tarnished as he was by his drug habits.    This polished sound was brought in by John Paul as well as Robert. The latter seemed to have grown weary of the band's over-the-top lifestyle, so he wanted to tone down the musical excesses as well although it meant to take away most of the band's appeal.     Overall there's plenty of synths and keyboards around. Bonzo's drum sound is a bit ethereal and not so in-your-face as it had been.     Now with the songs:    -In the evening. A good start nonetheless. Percy's voice is also far mellower. Beside him wanting to leave his legendary antics behind, he sure had worn out his voice over the previous decade off and on stage.    -Southbound Saurez. Sounds little like Zeppelin though the performances are ok.    -Fool in the rain. Who the hell thought of putting this on record? Not a bad song but  it's totally unZeppelin.    -Hot Dog. An upbeat song that once again shouldn't have been on the album.    -Carousalambra. The epic track of the album, overlong and little exciting.    -All my love. Percy's ode to his deceased son Karac aside, it's far too soft. Definitely not a 'Thank you' revisited.    -I'm gonna crawl. The closing track is somewhat a soul ballad and one of the two songs I actually like on the cd. Though the four lads shine here, even the frail Jimmy, you can't help but chuckle at Robert's attempt to scream like in the old days.     Overall, a mediocre album for the greatest rock and roll band in the world. At least it's not as crappy as The Who's It's Hard, really a laugh.    2/5.
B00007LTIB|4.0|Close to the edge is a five stars album, Relayer is not, although it is a great Yes CD.  Gates of Delerium is one of the top epic in the Yes catalogue, not as great as Close to the edge, but not far from it. <br />Sound Chaser and To be over are also great, but not as good as And you and I and Siberian Kathru. For this reason, Relayer deserves a four stars, but it is real close to a five stars rating. It is a less known album that Fragile or Close to the Edge but still an essential cd for serious Yes fan.
B000003TAB|4.0|A handfull of essentials, a handfull 3.5 stars, and a handfull of garbage. <br /> <br />Don't feel like you fail as a fan if a third of what you hear on this album makes you feel like it was a waste of your money. Die hard fan or not, no one should feel compelled to like an album just because they like the band. Songs like Sliver and Aneurysm own hard, and a couple songs like Dive most fans of the band will like. There's also some garbage mixed in though that only hardcore-nothing-Nirvana-does-isn't-totally-awsome-fans would really enjoy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: Either find a cheap used copy, or listen to the tracks online and download the ones that don't blow.
B00007KWHN|4.0|I just like this album, although it is not as complex as the upcoming releases of the band, it is a great album.  Most of this material is still part of any current Yes show...Plenty of classic tracks, I've seen all good people\\", \\"Starship Tropper\\", \\"Yours is no disgrace\\" and \\"Perpetual Change\\" (A prophetic title for the many changes to come in the band !)...the only weak tune is \\"A venture\\" The rest is pure classic Yes, a must have for any Yes music fan !
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It's a very nice album.  As the liner notes say it sounds as fresh today as it did 40 years ago. Putting the disk in the CD player is like having a warm visit from beloved old friends. <br /> <br />I'm not much of a fan of moldy goldy,  but I've been listening to this album, Chicago Transit Authority (Chicago's debut album,) both incarnations of Blood Sweat and Tears, etc. And in one respect it all makes me very sad.  I grew up in this golden age of talent and creativity--a time when the music was the thing.  These three examples are only the the tip of the iceburg of what was happening in the music business back then. <br /> <br />Isn't it amazing (and sad) that with all the state of the art, wonderful technology of today that the music doesn't even approach the art of the Beatles, etc? <br /> <br />BTW,  I got this on a special, I guess,  for only $9.99 plus shipping.  Really good bang for the buck!
B00007LTIC|4.0|I am a big Yes fan, but you can count on me if one cd is poor, I will tell. I am not the kind to give five stars to every cd that a band that I like has done. See my Drama or Tormato review for instance ! <br />Going for the One is a great cd, I would say, under-estimated by many. <br />Awaken is one of the best from the band.  Unlike many reviewers, I love the three tracks in the middle, Turn of the century offer great melodic guitars and vocals.  Parralels is a good rocking song and Wonderoous Stories has a great emotion felt through the music. The opening track, Going for the one is energic and surprising but always good.  This is one of the Yes cd that I listen very often.  I agree with the one who said that Rhino should have release the bonus tracks on another cd.  Also, why they didn't make a release like Close to, Relayer, Fragile or Tales, with a carton cd cover instead of the plastic one ??? Why just this cd is made like this ?
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all, I would like to point out that Lateralus made me a Tool fan.  If you are discovering this incredible musical group for the first time, this is the place to start.  I first heard Tool on my local rock radio station in 7th grade.  It was the heaviest, darkest music I had ever heard and at the time it didn't strike me as the type of thing I would ever be into.  As my musical appreciation grew, I gave Tool another chance, starting with Lateralus.<br /><br />The first time that I listened to the whole album it honestly didn't leave much of an impression on me.  Keep in mind that this was during a college semester in which the smooth melodic sounds of Sublime and Matisyahu emanating from my room made it the place to be for warm, friendly interaction.  This was no place for the harsh lyrics and gripping guitar play that have become so meaningful now more than ever.  This semester I am working in rural South Carolina as part of my major, two hours from everyone I know and care about.  As boredom and loneliness set in, I suddenly understood why Tool is such an incredible band.  More than anything else I have heard, Tool characterizes the struggles that constantly play out inside all of us.  The music of Tool speaks directly to emotions such as despair, loss, and hopelessness, but rather than glorifying these downfalls like the entire \\"Emo\\" genre, there is a fury present in every Tool song that spurs the continuation of the struggle, if for no reason other than to spite the antagonistic universe which conspires to make life unpleasant, or to use the Tool-ism, \\"disgustipating.\\"  The well presented Naturalistic attitude coupled with the masterful style would lead me to call Lateralus the Grapes Of Wrath of modern music.  Just as with great pieces of literature, it is not necessary to have the same philosophical view as the artist in order to appreciate the work.<br /><br />Based on the music alone, this album is a masterpiece.  No one can deny that the members of Tool are exceptionally creative and talented musicians, and many would agree that this is their best performance.  The production of Lateralus is what makes it stand apart from other Tool albums, which have been criticized as being a little rough around the edges.  Lateralus is a great album in all areas, and if you like what Tool has to offer, I would encourage you to explore their other albums, in particular Aenima, which is a little heavier but just as powerful as Lateralus.  Also, if Tool is just a bit outside of the realm of your musical taste, A Perfect Circle may be a group worth looking into for similar themes presented through a somewhat more accessible style.exceptionally creative and talented musicians, and many would agree that this is their best performance.

B00007KWHP|4.0|This cd contains great classic tracks of the band, but there is some poor tracks, just enough to miss the five stars rating.  The classic are \\"Roundabout\\", \\"South Side of the Sky\\", \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\", which is one of my favorite of the band. The good track are \\"Long distance runaround-The Fish\\" and \\"Mood for a day\\" <br /> <br />The weak side of the album is \\"We have heaven\\", \\"Cans and Brahms\\", \\"Five per cent per nothing\\", but these are short tracks....
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie tells the story of a young woman named, surprisingly, Amelie, who lives alone in the district of Montmartre, Paris. She is intensely introverted and loves exploring the lives of others from a distance and piecing together facts about them, especially during her job as a waitress. In the end, she finds love-- but I won't give too much of this amazing movie away!!!<br /><br />Amelie is a film that could be classified as \\"cute\\", but the delivery of the lines keep the emotions genuine and entirely plausible. The end is predictable in the way that all love stories are, but the small stories that the movies explore along the way (i.e. other romances, etc.) keep it highly entertaining. Amelie is often very funny as well, in a subtle and whimsical way.<br /><br />Those who appreciate good cinematography will love this movie also; the angles of the camera, the colors of the costumes and the sets, and the warm filters portray a nostalgic Paris that you will find yourself longing for even if the thought of visiting France has never entered your mind.<br /><br />Basically, this is a movie that everyone can appreciate!!! Definitely one of my favorite movies, if not THE favorite.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|(Those're Mr. Springsteen's words up there, not mine, but I wholeheartedly agree.)<br /><br />I know that Springsteen fans will argue over and over about what should be included in an \\"essential\\" collection of the artist's work, but this collection is, in my opinion, absolutely superb. It's also a great introduction to his work for those people who don't know much about his style or range. It's impossible to release a collection that contains all the heart and soul, but this is a good start.<br /><br />I know that many people will think it's kind of an extended greatest hits collection, but with Springsteen--oh, man. It doesn't matter if  his songs are popular hits; that shouldn't turn you off of his music. His songs become hits because people connect fully with what he wrote and crafted, as well as with the man himself. Take \\"Born in the USA,\\" for example. You can look at the song as something people mistakenly turned into an anthem (and therefore something that doesn't belong in this collection), or you can look at it as the catalyst for many fan's snickers and disdain aimed at politicians who tried to do the anthem thing and put Springsteen squarely on their side. Springsteen crafted a satirical song, and he always treated it that way in concert. So, stop thinking of a Springsteen \\"hit\\" as in any way similar to, say, a Backstreet Boys \\"hit,\\" and you'll be okay. If that were all this collection contained--just the hits, ma'am--this would still be superb.<br /><br />But it contains more. It contains songs from albums that weren't so wildly popular, and previously unreleased songs that give you glimpses into other sides of the man and his influences (there's a third bonus disc that provides us with some stuff we likely have never heard before).<br /><br />Buy this collection; hear this man sing of 70's gang fights, of what it means to be truly free when your world seems to be nothing but limitation, of faith in the human spirit, of learning how to be a partner in a relationship. Read (and reread, as I do) the lyrics. Remember that this man performs with all his heart and soul up on stage, just like in the studio recordings, and be amazed by how damn much this guy LOVES to sing, record, and perform. Then, if you don't already own the rest of his stuff, buy all the other cd's so you can see the depth of his emotional range. Then, with all that wonderful music playing in your head, you'll have the heart, the soul. Or at least, you'll have Mr. Springsteen's, since he's singularly eager to expose those parts of himself to you in his music.<br /><br />Enjoy!er in a relationship.

1582701709|1.0|This book has no basis in reality, thinking positive is good, but will not perform miracles. It is dangerous and irresponsible that this book promotes that you can \\"think\\" your way out of serious illness, I hope no one takes this advice and gets hurt.
0920668372|4.0|This is a beautiful story of a mother's love for her child and her child's love for her.  The idea that is to be grasped, toward the end of the book, is that the memories the mother has of taking care of and loving her son are still with her and that to the very end she loves him enough to still \\"rock him\\".  She doesn't actually go climb the ladder and rock him!  I understand that thought completely.  I will always have an open spot on my lap and in my arms for my child - but I fully recognize that doesn't mean she's always going to want to take advantage of it!   While this book is a tear-jerker, my daughter has no problem understanding the concepts.  Perhaps a 5 year old is better equipped to understand unconditional love than adults; after all a 5 year old is more inclined to show unconditional love while the majority of adults have far too many \\"expectations\\" of those they love. <br /> <br />We love this book and all my friends and their kids do as well!
0393061310|4.0|I feel that perhaps I need to provide a disclaimer so that readers of this review can know where it is that I am \\"coming from\\".  I am a Christian; in fact, I am probably what most people would call a Christian Fundamentalist.  I am not sure if that is a fair label or not, but it might be insofar as I believe God created the Earth and is intimately involved in its history.  I point this out not to convince anyone of the validity of my faith (that would be an absurd undertaking over this medium, to be sure), but rather so that those reading this review can better understand the lens through which I read this book.    With that bit of business out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Some people might find that inconsistent with my faith since this book is very evolutionary in thought.  Nevertheless, I do not find Diamond's arguments and evidence concerning the evolution of the world to be in contradiction to Christianity (though others no doubt disagree).  In fact, I at times felt his \\"evolutionary\\" evidence boosted my faith.  All of these mutant strains of vegetation that allowed civilizations to thrive; and all of these chance attributes of choice animals that also allowed civilizations to thrive; all of these \\"lucky chances\\" are just too much for me to not believe in God's providence.  Diamond would certainly interpret his evidence in different ways than I have, not doubt, but that does not detract from the evidence itself.  To each his own...    Many people have criticized Diamond's book because it minimizes that \\"human\\" factor.  I agree that Diamond's book does do this (although not to the extent that some have claimed), and I think this is a good thing.  How are we Americans/Europeans to boast or be arrogant when we had nothing (or much less) to do with the advancement of our civilization.  It turns out we are not smarter or more talented (Diamond argues that in fact we were often less smart and less talented), but just the lucky benefactors of \\"chance\\".If Diamond's work can have any effect in trimming the general arrogance and pride of Western Civilization then I think he has accomplished a good task.    This book provides the historian with alternative explanations to the course of world history; enough with the importance or ingeniousness of European invention and Christopher Columbus.  These explanations simply won't do.  Diamond brings into the equation factors that are too often overlooked, namely geography, climate, and availability of easily cultivatable vegetation and adaptable livestock.  I would give this book 4.5 stars if Amazon let me do such a thing.  Those who say that this is a dry, slow read simply don't understand the magnitude of the argument being made (at least they make that mistake in my opinion).  I think Diamond did a great job of making the material interesting, and his writing was very good.  A great addition to anyone's library.  Certainly a worthy recipient of the Pulitzer Prize.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|I am a huge fan of Yanni and I have almost all his albums. On this DVD, athough the sound quality is good, the sound levels of  the different instruments were not set right. You could hear the keybaords and almost nothing else, unless it was a solo violin or solo any other instrument then you could hear it playing next to the keyboards. It was quite a playback to me and wasn't as perfect as his DVD Tribute, so I give it 4.
B00005JPO7|4.0|Winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Feature, \\"The Lives of Others\\" offers a stark but moving portrayal of the people in 1980's Socialist East Germany, before the fall of the Berlin Wall.<br /><br />Ulrich Muhe stars as stern Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler, a man who seems successful within the Socialist system yet leads a life as sterile and empty as the apartment he returns home to every night.  When Wiesler carries out a surveillance assignment to monitor Georg Dreyman, a writer known as \\"the only non-subversive author read in the West\\", he suffers a crisis of confidence as he witnesses the corruption within his government and subsequently comes to envy and even care for the very subjects of his surveillance.<br /><br />The movie is perhaps a bit overlong, but that might be due to the fact that there are many themes played out over the course of its two hours and seventeen minutes.  This is the kind of movie that, without being too chaotic and forced, has a lot going on - it works both on a human level while also having a strong thematic/social aspect.<br /><br />So a viewer can both invest in the personal, emotional struggles of the characters while also appreciating the nature of the larger, overarching structural system that contains and constrains them.  In many ways, these two aspects are inseparable, as one sees in this film that the same kinds of people show up in all types of governments - the corrupt, the true believers, the incompetent buffoons, the self-serving careerists.  And one also gets the sense that love and betrayal usually possess enough power to throw a monkey wrench into even the most seemingly sturdy societal organizations, whether that organization is fueled by fear or by capital.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how this film depicted the fact that life's little actions sometimes have huge and irreversible consequences. And it also does an artful job illustrating the simultaneously cyclical and entropic nature of governmental corruption - we see how some governments tend to create their own enemies, thus seemingly perpetuating the need for their own corrupt existences, only to ultimately collapse upon themselves.<br /><br />Holding all of this together is a solid ensemble cast topped off with a terrific performance by Muhe; in a key and moving scene, the actor does an astonishing job of letting just one tear escape from his otherwise stone-faced visage.  And, through this one action alone, one gets the sense that this single drop of water might be the first trickle of a dam bursting.  Or, perhaps, a wall coming down.tal corruption - we see how some governments tend to create their own enemies, thus seemingly perpetuating the need for their own corrupt existences, only to ultimately collapse upon themselves. <br /> <br />Holding all of this together is a solid ensemble cast topped off with a terrific performance by Muhe; in a key and moving scene, the actor does an astonishing job of letting just one tear escape from his otherwise stone-faced visage.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|First off, I will say that I enjoyed these movies as great entertainment.<br /><br />I realize that for some people, these movies are vehicles for philosophy for you.  We each have different vehicles that work for us to learn the truths of life, so I am trying not to be too arrogant in my comments, but I am just flabbergasted that so many people follow the text and slightest nuance (intended or not) as if it were holy writ.<br /><br />It really scares me that our culture has become so sanitized and bland, that people are looking to movies like this for meaning.  Sure, there is a little there, but it is smashed in with new-age mumbo and eye-candy.  You want to learn of life and truth?  Read Ghandi, read the words and thoughts of truly great men.  Or really take the plunge into profound searchings for the truth and meaning and read Christ, Buddha, or Mohammed.<br /><br />You want things in movie form?  Watch Ghandi, the killing fields, Hotel Rwanda, or Schindler's list, etc.<br /><br />But it you really want to learn philosophy, the kind that really matters, go seek out those who suffer more than you can possibly imagine, look in their eyes and hear their stories.  Keep your heart open and let them touch you.  Cry with them.  It is amazing how fully life begins to change.<br /><br />There is so much more out there than what is found in this movie!  Put the video games, football games, and beer aside for Just a moment, and try to truly see.  It gets addictive, trust me.
1400044162|5.0|With Half of a Yellow Sun, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie presents her readers with a gorgeously wrought story set in horrific times. I don't remember the Nigerian-Biafran civil war, but I do recall the time for my first exposure to television pictures of starving children. Adichie provides context for those memories. In this novel, war and class, foreign policy indifferent to human suffering when oil is involved, malnutrition and prejudice, arrogance, dependence and corruption, and genocide serve as the backdrop for stories of love and loyalty, childhood and morality and identity, belonging and exclusion, forgiveness and betrayal, vibrancy, hope and grief, survival and resilience, family and friendship.    The characters are full-bodied and dynamic. We meet kind, bright, innocent Ugwu at age 13 as he leaves his village to work as a houseboy. He discovers the comparative opulent lifestyles of city-dwellers with their running water and daily eating of meat. Over a brief period of time, his role expands from houseboy to student, teacher, army conscript, and writer.     It is through Ugwu's observations of the visitors to Odenigbo's house that we begin to learn about the move to secession and the personalities involved in Biafra's formation. Odenigbo treats Ugwu with kindness and, in congruence with his revolutionary socialist ideals, promotes the boy's education. But this represents Odenigbo's only success in bringing his political theorizing to fruition.    Odenigbo's mistress is the beautiful, London-educated Olanna. She abandons her parents' lavish and privileged lifestyle, declining the opportunity to wait out the war with them in favor of supporting of Odenigbo's social principles. Olanna's gentleness, compassion, and sense of self are tested as the war progressively claims those around her through chaos, massacre, and starvation. We are witness to her realization that: \\"If she had died, if Odenigbo and Baby and Ugwu had died, the bunker would still smell like a freshly tilled farm and the sun would still rise and the crickets would still hop around. The war would continue without them. It was the very sense of being inconsequential that pushed her from extreme fear to extreme fury. She had to matter. She would no longer exist limply, waiting to die.\\" And so she rises above and learns to survive.    In contrast to Olanna's naïveté, her non-identical twin sister Kainene responds to the struggle with clear-eyed determination. Kainene recognizes that, at heart, this war is ultimately not a struggle for self-determination but a bid to control resources (namely oil). She describes Nigeria's ruling elite as \\"a collection of illiterates who read nothing and eat food they dislike at overpriced Lebanese restaurants and have social conversations about one subject: `How's the new car behaving?'\\" She has no illusions about where this attitude will lead, and when war breaks out turns her shrewd mind from running her father's factories to assuring the survival of those dear to her. Improbably, Kainene takes as her lover Richard, a British expatriate writer who is enamored with ancient Igbo-Ukwu art and is desperately seeking to be seen as Biafran.    This is a marvelous book. With glorious prose, Adichie presents the war as lived by these thoroughly human characters. Their experiences linger in my mind. I gave this book 4 stars when I first read it. Half of a Yellow Sun has been nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize: Africa. It was also included in the New York Times 100 Notable Books of 2006. What makes a book great is its power to move people. I have been moved. Given the continued impact that this book has on my thinking, perhaps it deserves 5 stars.    The Biafran conflict serves as a mirror for current-day Iraq, a country immersed in turmoil due to war and class, foreign policies indifferent to human suffering when oil is involved, malnutrition and prejudice, arrogance, dependence and corruption, and genocide. Iraq in the late twentieth century was much the same as Nigeria in the 1960s: ruled by dictators appointed, anointed, and supported by foreign powers; pressured by these great nations and their multinational financiers to keep the oil (and hence the money) flowing outward; and manipulated to increase division among tribal and religious groups, thereby weakening those factions who might oppose such indirect rule.     Today, of course, there are no pictures of starving Iraqi children on our televisions each evening. In the decade prior to the 2003 US invasion, nearly 2,000,000 Iraqis had died from starvation and disease. War certainly has not improved the plight of the survivors. But the world can only guess at the current extent of malnutrition and death by starvation and preventable disease. The Iraqi Development Fund, charged with meeting the minimal nutritional needs of its country's people, involuntarily funnels millions of dollars a year to its sole supplier, Halliburton.     Given the incapacity of the US government, its military, and their Iraqi trainees either to negotiate a cease-fire between guerilla parties or to enforce order in the absence of such negotiation, humanitarian agencies have been forced to suspend operations because of the extreme risks posed to their representations. The only information regarding the welfare of the Iraqi people comes from embedded journalists whose access and content is controlled by their US military overseers. Perhaps in some distant future, the stories of semi-fictional Iraqis will be presented to us with the same clear-sightedness and passion provided by Adichie in Half of a Yellow Sun. As Kainene says, \\"There are some things that are so unforgivable that they make other things easily forgivable.\\" What will we be able to forgive when we learn the truth?

0156012197|1.0|I feel that this version lost too much of its original flavor and poetry; it strayed far too away from the original French version. In essence, I find that that makes a book almost meaningless. It's like serving the best main course dinner you could possible imagine yet only to realize there isn't a morsel of salt. Sure, the food could look good, but the taste is another story. <br /> <br />I find the translation by Katherine Woods much more satisfying
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I wrote a rather long and in depth review of Neon Bible, and it was deleted, or just never processed by Amazon.  So I'm here with a much shorter review concentrating on the most powerful song on the album: Windowsill <br /> <br />Starting out with just the thumb-index picking of two notes on an acoustic guitar, Win Butler sings about how he doesn't want to be like his father, or any of the other people around him.  He doesn't want be judged by anything his Father's done.  Then the drums and bass come in, and he announces about how the world is falling apart, how the \\"tide is rising still/but I don't want to see it at my windowsill\\".  Then he announces about how he can't breathe or see thanks to the burden thrown on him by TV.  Then he asks, \\"World War III When are you coming for me?/Been kicking up sparks, set the flames free/the windows are locked now, so what'll it be?/a house on fire, a rising sea?\\"  Basically asking the question all of have- Are you going to die from your own country, or your enemies, a powerful question for anyone in todays world.  Earlier in the song he announces \\"I don't want to fight in a holy war/I don't want to live in America no more,\\" an angry call for action, as Arcade Fire are Canadian, and he's sick of Canada being the same as America just because they're neighbors, and how America looms as an ever present threat, telling Canada to do things with the threat of destruction.   <br /> <br />I never expected my choice for intelligent protest to be Arcade Fire, but now that I look back I totally understand it.  One of the best albums of the year by far.
B000MV9026|5.0|I loved this movie! I saw it twice. I see Mumble as a child with special needs trying to fit in with his peers. I have special needs myself for I am learning disabled and have and under developed hands from chemotherapy I recived for leukemia when I was a little girl and this is how I view Mumble. He can't be gay if he is in love with Gloria, how does that work? This movie teaches children to be patient with people who are different from themsleves and that they need to take care of their environment. Also, as far as the \\"adult-type\\" jokes are concerned, for people who have to complain about that; animators put those in there so the parents and teens and college kids like myself aren't bored for an hour and a half, and um, hello? They do put ratings on movies, you can't complain about how animators create their movies.
B000NTPDK0|4.0|The British royal family has weathered abdications, wars, and scandal. But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.<br /><br />And so \\"The Queen\\" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.<br /><br />The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.<br /><br />What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.<br /><br />Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying (\\"Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!\\").<br /><br />Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.<br /><br />She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.never knew.

B00005JLPK|3.0|This has all the story elements of a great movie: a talented and outspoken woman painter; her relationship with Diego Rivera, Leon Trotsky, and others; Mexico from the 1920s-1950s; the Rockefellers; communism; more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the outspoken and dramatic hands of Salma Hayek, Frida Kahlo's story becomes a mediocre soap opera. Hayak shows her breasts a few times to keep the boys interested; there are some lesbian interludes to show Frida's bisexual side; Diego comes and goes and has sex with everyone he can. Hayak plays it as a modern and brash young woman full of herself and the world.<br /><br />I thought we might learn about: Mexico in the 1920s-30s and the communist influence there; Frida's art; Rivera's art; other artists; art & communism; Frida's family; Rivera's family; Frida's motivations. We get a little of this but it mostly revolves around blood and sex.<br /><br />The script is TV-grade, with dramatic pauses and shallow talk. The direction is weak and distracting, especially when collages are used to depict places and events.<br /><br />There are other movies about Frida. See one of them.
B00005V9IL|3.0|This is a pretty decent movie with a noticeable big budget.  However, it's marred by the incredibly atrocious acting paired with even worse dialogue.  The female lead Mary S. overacts throughout the entire movie.  She's just trying to hard and it's distracting as well as annoying.  I really wanted her to have drowned.  Ed Harris is barely any better.  Both tend to scream theri lines and start to yelling at people during high tension moments.  Biehn was decent.  The dialogue unbelievably is even worse.  Lines include: \\"I am an iron clad bitch\\", \\"Keep your panties on\\", \\"howdy, how you guys doin'\\" [first contact] etc.  I mean some of this dialogue is the worst I've ever heard in any movie.  Even the alien's dialogue is cheesey. <br /> <br />The movie was overly long.  I guess Cameron wanted to show all his expensive footage of the abyss.  Understandable but it kills the pacing.  Many of the moments were just too overdramatic.  Mary S. drowning and Harris refusing to give up.  Being that his acting is subpar doesn't help any.  A lot of the dialogue is blatantly dubbed and not even matching.  The plot is decent, but contrived and predicatable.  There was no suspense that Harris or Mary S. would actually die, especially after Harris went into overdrive by slapping her around.  The aliens would undoubtedly save Harris even though he has enough time to type essays back to command. <br /> <br />I just don't see how people can find this movie great.  It's decent at best.  The worst parts are the acting, dialogue and contrived plot.  Some of the action sequences were well done, I have to admit but that's the best thing going for it.
B0002ADXYI|4.0|I love the early Uriah Heep material as much as the next mid-Boomer, but \\"Salisbury\\" and \\"Very 'eavy, Very 'umble\\" would be an extremely redundant combination to purchase.  If one is not familiar with U. Heep, better to pair either of these early recordings with a \\"Best of U. Heep\\" or one featuring the current U. Heep lineup of musicians. <br /> <br />The album art for \\"Very 'eavy, Very 'umble\\" was actually used on the U.S. release of \\"Salisbury\\" (or I have my vinyl LPs in the wrong sleeves, but I think not).  The cobweb face guy was also projected onto the drum kit's double bass drum heads for an interesting lighting effect. <br /> <br />Unless one is an extreme U. Heep fan, either of these early albums would be a great investment; either, but not both together. <br />
B00005JKES|1.0|What is the purpose of a season 2 set if Season 1 is unavailable? And season one didn't even have the pilot! We are just being jerked around here.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I just received my DVD of this fabulous adaptation of my favorite classic,   and I could not stop watching it!   My first thought when I heard there was yet another version was,  \\"Good grief,  why do they need another one?\\"   (my same reaction when I heard that another Pride and Prejudice was being made).   I own a copy of nearly every version of Jane Eyre that has been made,  except for the Orson Welles version,  which I hated anyway.   This is by far one of the most worthy additions to the list.          I had not thought that the 1983 Timothy Dalton version could be topped,   but I believe this one did it.    I had my own gripes with that version-Timothy Dalton was far too beautiful to play Rochester and Zelah Clarke was too old (she looked 27,  not 18) too curvy (Jane was very tiny and thin),  and far too perky.   But it followed the book much more than did other versions.    However,   this adaptation followed the book quite well,  more so than the Ciaran Hinds version did.   I love Hinds in anything he does,  but he admits he hadn't read the book,  and played Rochester as a raging bull type of character.         Toby Stephens looks Rochester's age,   36-38,  and he is very nice looking but not too handsome for the role.      He does a good job expressing both Rochester's deep seated emotional pain and his quixotic sense of humour.   Ruth Wilson is amazing,   sometimes plain and sometimes as beautiful as Rochester tells her she is in the book.    The chemistry between the two is electric,  you really believe their feelings.           This isn't perfect,  of course.    Rochester is supposed to be very dark,  with black hair and black eyes.   I always look to the last scenes to see how the versions portray Rochester's injuries.   In the book,  he has lost his left eye and his face is terribly scarred.   His other eye is injured but he regains the sight in it over several years.   He also loses his left hand.   In this version,   Rochester appears to stay blind permanently.   His scarring consists of what looks like some acne on the left side of his face,  and his hand is intact but bandaged.   The book doesn't portray Rochester and Jane lying on her bed with him feeling her up as he tries to convince her to stay,  nor does she lie on top of Rochester once she agrees to marry him.  (although she does sit on his lap).     But if the book didn't have them sprawled all over each other,    you know they WANTED to be,  and the book might well have been written that way had it not been written in the mid-1800's.    These touches add to the vein of passion that runs all through the book,   you cannot deny that Jane and Rochester are highly sexual people.  So I didn't object to the slight touches of added sexuality,  in fact,  (snicker)  I hit the remote and watched them more than once!        This film also didn't really touch on Jane's deep religious faith or strong sense of self,   so people of today watching this might not \\"get\\"  why Jane had to leave her true love.      It was a bit silly to have the line in which Rochester offers to take her off to live as brother and sister,  as he obviously wants a sexual relationship with Jane as part and parcel of his great love for her.   And Jane leaves precisely because she KNOWS she wants him too and can't live as a mistress,   as she values herself too highly and knows how Rochester came to despise his other mistresses.   The version also doesn't make it clear how Charlotte Bronte,  and her character,  both believed in the guiding of Providence in lives.  Jane didn't go back to Rochester because her values had changed,   she went back because she felt God leading her back to him as opposed to leading her to marry St.John (another fascinating and complex character who was given rather short shrift,  but then,  how does one really explain St. John Rivers,  anyway?)              All in all,  this is among the best,  if not the best,  of the Jane Eyre adaptations.    I used to belongto an online Bronte discussion group,  and we would spend a lot of time planning the definitive,  \\"Jane Eyre to end all Jane Eyre\\"  versions.    We didn't have any of these casting choices,   but I have to say this version certainly comes close to what every Jane Eyre fan could possibly want.
B000J10EQU|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />There seems to be a feeling afoot that The Man of Steel may just possibly have outlived his usefulness - that after a 19-year-long hiatus from the big screen, Superman might be a tad too much of a straight-arrow boy scout to compete with all those morally confused, angst-ridden comic book heroes that have come our way in the past several years.  This is certainly the criticism I've heard most frequently leveled against \\"Superman Returns\\" - that the movie simply isn't sophisticated enough to have any relevance in our cynical, post-modern 21st Century age - but, frankly, I find the movie's simplicity, straightforwardness and actual LACK of sophistication to be rather refreshing for a change.  Not all comic book heroes need to be deeply conflicted to be interesting.  Some times it's nice just to believe in a super human savior who's ready to swoop down from the skies and rescue us from a fate-worse-than-death at a moment's notice, no questions asked.  Who's really going to be fussing about the do-gooder's moral and psychological ambiguity at a time like that anyway?<br /><br />As \\"Superman Returns\\" begins, we learn that the Man of Steel has been absent from the earth for five years, having gone back to his original planet, Krypton, after some astronomers located its whereabouts.  Having found little there but a desolate cinder, Superman returns to earth to re-kindle his love interest with Lois Lane and to resume his fight for truth, justice and...well, you fill in the rest for yourself, the filmmakers having cagily opted to de-emphasize the character's nationalism in an effort to boost the film's revenue potential overseas.<br /><br />As stated previously, \\"Superman Returns\\" is a relatively straightforward tale of good versus evil done in broad strokes with only a minimum of psychological shading.  Superman may have problems in the romance department, but he seems otherwise well adjusted to his role of the world`s sole functioning superhero.  Crippling self-analysis has really never been Superman's \\"thing\\" anyway so there wouldn't be much point in his suddenly becoming unduly brooding and introspective here.  Luckily, the film makes up in warmth and charm what it lacks in sophistication.  Director Bryan Singer wisely chooses to emphasize the romance over the storyline which is little more than the usual generic silliness about Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) inventing a machine that will allow him to take over the world (ho hum).  The real conflict comes with Superman discovering that Lois has moved on to a new love interest and has a five-year-old son.  Superman's attempts to woo her back provide some of the most lyrical, touching moments of the film.  In fact, Singer, who has directed the film with both energy and style, is at his best in the subtler moments when he's showing us Superman flying across the city and around the world, backed by some of John Williams' most subtle musical passages since \\"E.T.\\"  The Lex Luthor stuff, with all its attendant, high-tech special effects and eye-popping action sequences, just feels like the icing on the multi-million dollar cake.<br /><br />\\"Superman Returns\\" is far from a perfect film.  It runs way too long at 155 minutes and we still can't understand why nobody is able to put two and two together and figure out that Clark Kent and Superman are really one and the same person - especially when they both disappear for five years, then make a surprise return to town at exactly the same moment.  Oh well, some things one just has to accept on faith when it comes to movies of this type, I suppose, and this is clearly one of them.  Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth lack the spunk and charisma that Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder brought to the roles, but they have a chemistry that works well on screen anyway.<br /><br />At least \\"Superman Returns\\" has a bit of a heart and soul to it, which is more than can be said for other recent blockbusters like the \\"Mission Impossible\\" or \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" movies.  And even though I appreciate a layered, psychologically conflicted comic book figure as much as the next guy, it's nice to have the real thing back for a change as well.And even though I appreciate a layered, psychologically conflicted comic book figure as much as the next guy, it's nice to have the real thing back for a change as well.

0440219078|5.0|Why this book is pigeonholed as Children's Literature is a mystery to me, perhaps merely because the protagonist is a twelve-year old, perhaps owing to the author's past works--I'm just glad to have found it. \\"The Giver\\" treats the most profound issues in a manner that speaks of deep understanding; the book will ring you like a bell, the ideas resonate and can not be forgotten. For this reason I call this the rarest of books; once read it will immediately and forever be a part of the reader--in a sense, our author becomes her own creation, she becomes the Giver of memory and her reader a Receiver.<br /><br />It is a spare presentation of a dystopic future world where the \\"problems\\" of humanity have all been neatly resolved; everyone is polite, happy with their job, unthreatened by pain, sickness, conflict and even death. Though it becomes quickly evident that what the author really gives us is a rather convincing rationalization for the fact that evil, pain and suffering are necessary. Foes of religious belief often claim that the idea of pain and suffering is inconsistent with a loving God; but, even for the secular among us, Ms. Lowry shows how suffering and joy are linked. \\"The Giver\\" argues that granting unlimited license to those who would sacrifice individual choice in their attempts to achieve relief from war, famine and economic inequality could very well eliminate that which makes life worth living. \\"The Giver\\" says much about the danger of placing the interests of the community above the interests of individuals.<br /><br />To say much about the story risks spoiling the slow exposition of the underlying flaws in the utopia, which was exceptionally well paced. At first the \\"community\\" seems vaguely creepy, by the end of the book it is horrifying. \\"The Giver\\" is a novel of ideas that begs to be discussed and argued over as the part of any moral education. It is powerful beyond my ability to express and like any truth, it offers something of value to any reader at any level.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation.reader at any level. <br /> <br />Highest Recommendation.

In a world where information is freely available, the information and all the left brain techniques used to manipulate, store and retrieve it are no longer a differentiator.
B000GTLQXU|1.0|Wow! I can not believe anyone could have anything good to say about this lame movie!? I must say that being a pre-teen when the original film was released, I saw this film many times at the theater. Who could resist this adventure? The young boy is one of the heroes and we get to ooggle  Pamela Sue Martin in hot pants! In the original film when Roddy McDowell (\\"Ackers\\") and Shelly Winters (\\"Bel\\") die we feel genuinely sad. When Jack Albertson (\\"Manny\\") discovers his wife of 50 years has suffered a heart attack after saving the preacher from a horrible under water death, we feel empathy for him (Albertson). I am a big fan of the original, though I must admit it has lost some steam as I've grown older. First I want to point out I have a very nice home theater with a 10 foot screen. I watched a HD version of the new film, so it had everything going for it. The remake doesn't take any time to develop the characters, so nobody cares that their lives are in danger or if they die! There is no build up to the giant wave, so there is no tension when it capsizes the ship! I also thought the special effects were NOT all that big an upgrade, if at all!  This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen! All the acters including the stars phoned in the performances and the action sequences did not equal the sweat inducing \\"swim along the rope under water\\" sequence of the original. A complete waste of time and money! If you are going to try to remake a movie,this is the way NOT TO DO IT!
B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison's 1971 album \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was the first official solo release from the former Beatle. At the time of its initial pressing, it was hailed as a masterpiece by critcs and fans alike, and is ofen debated as the finest solo work from The Fab Four (John's \\"Imagine\\" and Paul's \\"Band On The Run\\" are its main competition).<br /><br />To commemorate its 30th anniversary, in January of 2001, a mere eleven months before his untimely passing, George oversaw the release of a digitally remastered version of the album, complete with new packaging as well as bonus tracks, including a new recording of an old classic that I will get to in a moment.<br /><br />\\"All Things Must Pass\\" is bar none, one of the finest rock albums ever made. Some of the most raw, emotional and powerful music ever recorded is present here, and the remastering job emphasises it. From the opening \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" to the epic closing jam \\"Out Of The Blue\\", \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is George at his unrivaled artistic peak. Songs like \\"Wah-Wah\\", the classic \\"What Is Life\\" (used excellently in \\"Goodfellas\\") and the jams are George at his most upbeat and loose, while \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", \\"Beware Of Darkness\\", the heartwrenching title track and the aching \\"Hear Me Lord\\" are George stripped down, raw and at his most passionate.<br /><br />And then of course, there's the classic \\"My Sweet Lord\\", a massive hit single and a timeless call for theistic unity whose message still strikes a chord today. The new version is nice, but to hear the original classic version more crisper and clearer than ever before is a dream come true.<br /><br />The liner notes don't leave much other than a few lyrcis (not the full ones), but the music istself is such a treat that this ultimately doesn't matter.

6304698682|4.0|Clint Eastwood's 1985 Western &#34;Pale Rider&#34; is an obvious combination of two earlier Westerns: &#34;Shane&#34; from 1953 and Eastwood's own &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; from 1973. &#34;Pale Rider&#34; is, no doubt, an homage to these films rather than a rip-off.<br /><br />THE STORY: A mysterious drifter with a clerical collar rides into town as an angel of mercy to the local miner settlers and an angel of punishment to their rich oppressor and his men.<br /><br />The difference between &#34;Pale Rider&#34; and &#34;Shane&#34; is that &#34;Pale Rider&#34; is a much more modern take on the same basic story; plus, unlike &#34;Shane,&#34; &#34;Rider&#34; possesses a supernatural element. Although &#34;Shane&#34; is definitely the better film in a historical sense, &#34;Rider&#34; is a more palatable experience to modern viewers.<br /><br />As for comparisons to &#34;High Plains Drifter,&#34; &#34;Pale Rider&#34; is a much better picture. &#34;Drifter&#34; has a slow, tedious vibe and all the characters are unlikable (but two). Eastwood plays a mean anti-hero who enacts revenge on an entire town and three villains; he only displays kindness to two people. In &#34;Drifter&#34; he's SOLELY an agent of vengeance. This is not the case with &#34;Pale Rider&#34; where Eastwood's character, known only as 'The Preacher,' is equal parts mysterious, intriguing, heroic and supernatural. In other words, the viewer both likes and roots for 'The Preacher.'<br /><br />As noted in my title blurb, &#34;Pale Rider&#34; features one of the most memorable lines in cinematic history. Megan, an almost-15-year-old girl, informs The Preacher that she thinks she loves him. The Preacher coolly responds: &#34;Nothing wrong with that. If there was more love in the world there'd be a lot less dying.&#34; It's a powerful scene/line and good advice to live by.<br /><br />The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California and Idaho.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
B000LC55F2|2.0|I do not have the enthusiasm in this movie as other reviewers.  I watched The Illusionist and liked that so I bought this when it was released.  I didn't know what to expect, it was a clever movie with great stars but it seemed to lack something.  I liked the Illusionist better and not because it's a 'chick' flick because I don't go for those.  It took a bit to get in to The Presteige and by the end I was bothered by the outcome.  I will have to watch it a second time to see if I can come to a better feeling about the movie but until I do, I am disappointed.  I don't care for happy endings either but I cannot think of what I'd have hoped the outcome to be. <br /> <br />Maybe if...  No I wont say it because I don't want to spoil the movie! <br /> <br />Sorry this review is simply on my opinions rather than important specs of the movie.  It is good enough to give it another chance though so I will watch it again and hope I will enjoy it more.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|I enjoyed Babel, but not on the level of \\"best picture of the year.\\" I found last year's Crash to be a much better drama of this sort (multiple stories intermingling). The acting is stellar, the story is well told, and the scenery and imagery were breathtaking. These worlds I have known -Mexico and Japan, and I enjoyed watching those scenes. I thought this movie was probably a good thirty to forty-five minutes too long, especially since much of the ending seemed a bit too easily wrapped up. All-in-all, though, you could watch dozens of bigger wastes of time than Babel and it is a solid, thought provoking, and somewhat provocative movie.<br /><br />On a side note...what saddens me the most as I read the reviews is how so many people got uptight with some of the images in the movie. Their own discomfort with such things says more about them than the movie's content. Better to live in your dream world than to face reality, I guess. Now there's the real tragedy and truly the missed point of the movie. Movies like this force the viewer to confront things they'd rather not think about as they go about the deadening banality of their socially accepted and sanitized lives. I'm sure a good soaking in the bathtub of their home in the cul-de-sac followed by a excessive bloat at Applebee's and a materialistic orgasm at Wal-Mart made everything all better.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|My dad (now 73) and I went to see this movie together at the cinema with Mom.  We had no expectations what with decades of failing Bondses between us; Sean Connery of course defined the role but now he isn't even cool as a bloated retro-spy.  Lazenby - yuck.  Moore - cheesy.  Brosnan - girly.  Daltry - who?...  Sooo much room to get it wrong.  <br /> <br />Every single element was of this movie was stellar - the gadgets (not over the top), the plot (like a good steak dinner; juicy and chewy), and updated.  They somehow avoided the Schylla and Charybis of 'Tom Cruisifcation' and 'death by incredulous and distrating C.G.I.'.   <br /> <br />Our widely spread generational gang had no expectations, like I say, but to hopefully say the ticket price justified the time spent.  But lo and behold. When the credits rolled by, my dad and I just looked at each other in movie going rapture and said in union, 'That was the best Bond film EVER!'  Mom was quiet.  She was stupefied. <br /> <br />Who'd have thunk. <br /> <br />PS - I'm a very pro-female middle aged woman who could hardly think this type of film even sit-through-able, but I tell you, Daniel Craig is RED HOT.  I think Mom expressed the same in her stupefied silence.  Of course women's tastes grow more discerning with age. <br /> <br />

She gets a ride to vegas and befriends a young woman named Molly, Molly then helps her get a job a smalltime strip-club she works at doing make-up and such. Nomi then realizes that she wants more than this. She then auditions for a popular show called \\"Goddess\\", Nomi then becomes a surprising success. And many other entertainings happen during the film. The movie is filled with non-stop nudity witch helps the film to become very erotic. You will get an eyefull of the naked body of Elizabeth Berkley, Who you probably used to watch on \\"Saved By The Bell\\". The storyline is surprisingly good,The acting is also excellent.<br /><br />If you have a problem with nudity and the subject of \\"Rape\\" I wouldn't recommend this. But if you appreciate the female form and don't mind a little violence I would MOST defenitly recommend this.<br /><br />All in all this movie deserves a 10/10.

B000H0MKGK|4.0|i'll admit it: i was an annoying snob. prior to half a year ago or so, i would never have given this disc a chance. john mayer was for mtv teeny-boppers, right? I'm sure a lot of older folk out there are being close-minded as i was. well, my review is aimed at you, if you are one of those (though i'm not sure your ilk will ever arrive here to read this). i happened to see this cd appear on several best of 2006 year end lists. since these lists were put out by publications i enjoyed, i figured okay, i will give teeny-bopper music a try. if the album is terrible, i can always kill myself, right? well months have past and i am still here. this is a fantastic recording. I had no idea mr mayer could play guitar with such incredible skill. there are several outbursts of stunning guitar work displayed here, and the songs are excellent, sung with subtlety and poise. this is the work of a fabulous artist coming into his maturity. don't be stupid like i was; don't turn up your nose at this. give it a chance. this is fantastic music. period.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This review will be used interchangeably for a few titles. Event horizon, The darkness (Anna Paquin), And Jeepers Creepers. These are all excellent in one way or another, have good production values and acting. Jeepers has the best movie monster creation of the last 20 years. And the darkness has a great story and a solid non happy ending. Event horizon has excellent acting by Sam neill and Laurence fishburn and a truly creepy story. The bottom line is you see reviews for movies like these and Wes Cravens They for example where many people give them 2 star ratings while going on and on about The grudge or the ring 2 or house of wax, Blair witch 2 and Ring around the rosie (one of the worst and most pointless movies Ive ever watched.) This just goes to prove once again that the average person refuses to think and doesnt want a movie that might require any thought to follow. Originality is punished by the masses because clever things make them feel dumb.
B00005V1B2|4.0|put out in 1975, this is an outstanding, all instrumental album of prog-rock. shades of emerson, lake & palmer, shades of pink floyd, a touch of jethro tull. camel has, however, very much there own sound. classical flourishes and music with an epic anthem feel to it emerge out of quieter space-filled passages to create perfect juxtapositions. three pieces, in particular, that blend together perfectly are: \\"santuary,\\" a beautiful short guitar instumental seques into \\"fritha,\\" another delicate acoustic instumental, which then seques into \\"the snow goose,\\" a gorgeous electric guitar showcase, lyrical and aching. another highlight is \\"rhayader alone,\\" a dreamy instumental which is stunning. a fantastic album all around, highly recommended.
B00004W19V|4.0|Short Circuit is one of those films I rented as a kid back in the precious 80s when we got so many good family movies that just wouldn't see the light of day in these awful times. A Short Circuit made in 2007 would be mind-numbingly PC with bullet-time effects and a CGI Johnny voiced by a hip-hop 'artist'. It's a grim time for this genre indeed. But back in 1986 I had nothing to complain about as most of the family movies from that decade are fondly remembered as classics.<br /><br />I loved this movie as a kid and it's been a long, long time since I watched it from start to finish. Plus the VHS I rented back then was in horrid pan and scan with half the picture chopped-off. Which is a real shame since John Badham shot it brilliantly-framed Panavision. So I've never really seen the FULL movie until now. How does it hold-up 21 years later? Well, I guess you could say Johnny Five is kinda dated but not so much as all the rest of the 'ground-breaking' technology at the Nova factory. Number Five is a robot made for Military Stealth purposes and armed with a laser beam. But designer Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his partner Ben Jabituya (a non-Indian and very funny Fisher Stevens) originally designed him as a marital aid, apparently. They are unhappy with the way Nova has marketed the robot but after a demonstration to the Military, Five is struck by lightning and assumes consciousness. Needing input and desperate to learn more about his surroundings, he escapes the factory and journey's across Oregon, soaking up knowledge and the idiosyncrasies of modern human culture. As a reflection of today's 'zany' society, Five is full of spirit, personality and random pop-culture references.<br /><br />The Military are kinda annoyed at a potential lethal weapon (not the Mel Gibson kind) running loose about America, so it's their new mission to find him and destroy him. Five, who has been taken in by animal-lover (not in THAT way) Stephanie Speck (a gorgeous Ally Sheedy) does everything he can to stay out of harm's way. But they are persistent and won't let him live because they don't believe he is truly alive.<br /><br />It's not totally original since some of it feels inspired by the works of Issac Asamov and I doubt a film like this would have been green-lighted had E.T. not been so successful. But it is very enjoyable and funny and Johnny Five is a great character despite being nothing more than a puppet. Short Circuit is definitely a film for any kid born in the 80s. The video-game obsessed kids of today might to be so interested but its charming simplicity and good-natured story will never really date despite the old-fashioned 'cutting-edge' technology featured in the film.<br /><br />This DVD from Image Entertainment contains a NON-anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer with Dolby 5.1 sound and a commentary among a few other extras. I believe it also comes in a crappy snapper case. The UK DVD from Cinema Club however IS anamorphic but drops the commentary and has Dolby 2.0 sound. The rest of the extras remain. I'll take superior picture over the rest any day.does everything he can to stay out of harm's way.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|It's difficult to put a finger on exactly what sort of movie \\"Stranger Than  Fiction\\" is. \\"Dramedy\\" sounds mawkish. This film is sharp, creative, and beautifully crafted. It's likable and ultimately a tad sentimental as well. Novelist Karen \\"Kay\\" Eiffel (Emma Thompson) narrates the story of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), a methodical, mathematical IRS agent whose life has never deviated from its precise routine until this Wednesday. On Wednesday, two things changed: Harold began to hear a voice in his head narrating his every move. And Harold's wristwatch stopped. When Harold hears the narrator say that this would \\"result in his imminent death\\", he panics. The narrator has never been wrong before. He goes to a psychiatrist, who assures Harold that he's schizophrenic. So he turns to a professor of literature, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who, through a series of questions and experiments, tries to help Harold figure out what sort of story he is in.<br /><br />\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is funny and sweet, clever and thoughtful. It comments on the writing process in a new way, seeing the creation of character and story from both the writer and character's point of view. Being both an actress and a writer herself, Emma Thompson is the obvious and perfect woman for the role of Kay Eiffel. Great films need great supporting casts, and Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Tony Hale deliver the goods. We're not sure if Harold Crick is real or not, but Zach Helm's screenplay keeps us wondering. I was struck by the locations, production design, and visual effects that define Harold's universe, so I wasn't surprised to find that Marc Forster directed this film. He is obsessive about visual information and found fantastic locations in Chicago to express Harold's ordered universe. Harold's preoccupation with numerical data is made visible through a simulated graphic user interface, which blends seamlessly with his environment.<br /><br />I'm probably one of few people who has never liked Will Ferrell's comic performances. This relatively quiet dramatic role with lots of good humor suits Ferrell perfectly. It's his best role on the big screen yet. Harold somehow finds a way to be heroic though he doesn't control his own life. Kay struggles to find the courage to kill off her character where nerve has never failed her before. We have two interlaced tales of how Harold relates to the world and how a writer relates to her character. For a movie that is as good-natured as this is, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is awfully smart.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony Pictures 2007): Bonus features include an extended version of the Book Channel interview with Karen Eiffel, a deleted scene of a Book Channel interview with Peter Allen Prothero, and 5 featurettes. \\"Actors in Search of a Story\\" (18 min) includes interviews with director Marc Forster, producer Lindsay Doran, writer Zach Helm and the actors discussing characters, with a section on each character. In \\"Building the Team\\" (8 min), the cast and creative team talk about director Marc Forster, and he discusses preparing to shoot and visual style. \\"On Location in Chicago\\" (10 min) talks about the architecture in Chicago that became Harold's world. \\"Words on the Page\\" (9 min) interviews Zach Helm about the script and Forster about the film's tone. \\"Picture a Number: The Evolution of a G.U.I.\\" (17 min) interviews visual effects designer Kevin Tod Haug, Marc Forster, and the graphic designers who created Harold's graphic user interface. \\"On the Set\\" (3 min) is behind-the-scenes footage set to music.

B0000024V2|4.0|Johnny Winter unfortunately has only recorded two *great* albums in his career, this and the previous Columbia release 'Johnny Winter'. His first, on Mercury and called 'Progressive Blues Experiment' was badly produced and his playing hadn't reached its peak yet. Everything that came after Second Winter pales by comparison to his two first Columbia albums. <br /> <br />I'd give it 5 stars but as someone else has mentioned, some of the songs themselves are weak compositions. Four stars for incredible blues rock playing that has influenced practically every guitarist who has followed Winter. <br /> <br />I originally bought this on vinyl when it was first released and it was notorous for being a double LP with only three sides (the 4th side was blank).
1400064287|5.0|This book has something for everyone - an entrepreneur, journalist, and even a college student. If you ever wondered how to make your presentation more effective, how to communicate your vision better, or even structure an upcoming paper, this book should not disappoint. Dan and Chip Heath draw on a number of psychological studies done over the years to show the power of making your ideas: unexpected, concrete, credible, and emotional. The authors explore each of these aspects in great detail and provide a number of surprising results and examples - you're bound to have a few 'Aha!' moments! Which, (in theory) implies that the book itself is 'sticky'! It's a great read, highly recommended.
B000NIVJEU|4.0|I'm a dragon fan and I really liked this movie when I watched it on the big screen; the dragon is awesome and the story was good, although a bit predictable. Several people who have already read the story in print have told me that the book delves deeper into the characters' lives and now I want to read it to get the whole story. It has been my experience that most books are always greater than the movie (let's be realistic, we wouldn't want to sit to a 10- or 12-hour movie, would we?). I'm also glad to see that this book has done what the Harry Potter books have done, which is get younger people to read books again instead of wasting time watching TV or playing video games.
B000NHPCS0|3.0|Here are the good things about this movie when you see it the first time. You don't know who will end up coming out on top as there are a variety of levels of cat-and-mouse going on in this picture. Will the undercover good cop (DiCaprio) survive the efforts of the cop who is actually an \\"undercover bad guy\\" (Damon) who is trying to find the identity of the rat? Will the mob boss (Nicholson) outsmart the good cops in charge (Wahlberg, Sheen)? There are more questions than these you will want to know the answers to as the movie progresses, but then you find out amidst much blood and gore and dead bodies (there might be only two main characters out of close to 10 that actually live until the end of the movie) and that is that, all your questions are answered and maybe you are satisfied and maybe you are not. No matter what, you know and that is what made this movie even mildly interesting. Watching it again would be a bore. This movie has ridiculous violence. I do not mean excessive, I mean ridiculous to the point where if you have a strong stomach you'll probably just laugh at some of the bloody parts because they are so over the top. The acting is okay. I thought only Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon pulled their weight in this picture. DiCaprio does the worse accents in movies that I wish he would just stop trying. Wahlberg is okay in the movie, but certainly not deserving of an oscar nomination. <br /> <br />Basically, this movie is over-hyped and watchable once and only once.
B000004CYT|5.0|In the early 1980s I was indifferent to the use of period instruments in the music of Beethoven. I was very enthusiastic, to be sure, about the use of period instruments in Baroque and Renaissance music and I was rather partial to the sound of the Fortepiano in Mozart and Beethoven. I owned many of Collegium Aureum recordings of Mozart, J. C. Bach and Beethoven recorded in the 1970s and I enjoyed them a lot. I have a soft spot for the Collegium Aureum recording of the Triple Concerto of Beethoven, it is a favourite of mine and I've really never heard a recording I prefer over it. Strange, isn't it that Gardiner, Hogwood, Immerseel, Levin, Br&uuml;ggen, Norrington, Herreweghe and the other HIP conductors and performers haven't recorded it?<br /><br />I digress. Whilst walking down Chapel Street in Prahran in Melbourne one sunny Sunday afternoon with a girlfriend I walked into a music shop. I'd recently bought a CD player and I was on the look out for some good Classical recordings. I noticed the Hogwood recording of the Eroica and I had a listen to this recording on the headphones. I was astonished. In the slow movement it was as if I could hear the orchestra actually breathing. The use of fortepiano basso continuo also impressed me with the subtle colours it gave to the orchestra. Yep! I bought the disc on the spot and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />I love the Hogwood set because he does as little standing in the way between you and me, the listeners, and Ludwig van Beethoven, the composer, as possible. Does this make any sense? Perhaps not. However, Hogwood seemed to entrust Beethoven's written music with his players and he lets this music be itself.<br /><br />The performances are exciting and moving. I like every moment in this set except the tempo of the March section of the 4th movement of the 9th Symphony, which uses the erroneous metronome mark (the tactus should be halved).<br /><br />This recordings stands up incredibly well against the more recent recordings by Gardiner and Br&uuml;ggen, for instance, although I think many may prefer Gardiner these days (and Br&uuml;ggen's recordings are very, very good, too).<br /><br />The best HIP/period Beethoven symphonies? Hard to say, but I do like the sets by Norrington, Hogwood, Gardiner, Goodman and Br&uuml;ggen. As I said, I have some very warm feelings of affection for Christopher Hogwood's pioneering recordings of the Beethoven Symphonies. I bought this repackaged set a few years ago and I return to it often.rüggen, for instance, although I think many may prefer Gardiner these days (and Brüggen's recordings are very, very good, too).

The director finally received his long awaited oscar for this film and he really earned it especially with this masterpiece.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Whoa, hold on there... Come on guys,<br /><br />This isn't that bad of a movie!<br /><br />I just watched the DVD (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition) of \\"The Final Frontier,\\" and actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />Now, I admit I was one of the disappointed movie-goers back in 1989, but it has aged nicely.<br /><br />EXCEPT, for the exterior spaceship special effects.<br /><br />What Star Trek V really needs now, is the Remastered treatment that The Original Series is enjoying.  I think some new digital spaceships, a little clean up and you'll have a dandy Star Trek epic.<br /><br />I think Shatner should demand a new Director's Edition with remastered effects.  His instincts for directing Star Trek V were pretty good.  Shows he was paying attention all these years.
B000LC55F2|5.0|A friendship....an accidental death....revenge....a rivalry ensues....THE PRESTIGE.<br /><br />I forget the reason I went to see The Prestige in the first place, but I won't forget the reasons I went to see it the 2nd and 3rd time around.  If you like tales of mystery, suspense, and revenge, then this film is for you.  If you've only seen it once, you'll leave the theater asking yourself if you really saw what you thought you saw.  Well, unless wrote the story or the screenplay, then the answer is a resounding NO.  There are so many twists and turns and puzzles to be solved that it will take two or three or maybe even more viewings to finally grasp the excellence of this film.  If you're not watching again because you missed important plot points, you're probably watching it again because you really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Whether or not you understand the plot, this film will haunt you by the great performances of Bale, Jackman, and Michael Cain as the Engineer.  The voiceovers were done great as both magicians read both diaries througout the movie.  They draw you into the story and you wonder what will be the next move performed by each rival. The dialogue between characters and overall emotions were done perfect.  You don't feel cheated by any of the performances.  What I mean by that is Borden and Angier and the cast of characters around them are entirely believable. I first saw Christian Bale in Batman Begins and really didn't have any faith in him, but boy what a difference in this movie.  He has extraordinary potential as an actor. Bale, being a Brit himself, managed to come up with a wildly thicker accent than he actually has and it plays in perfectly with his character.  The broke magician who knew the secrets of magic and never gave up on his craft despite his adversities.<br /><br />I give another thumbs up to Andy Serkis and David Bowie who plays famed physicist Nikola Tesla.  Again, Andy Serkis is best known for his fabulous performance in the Lord of the Rings films, however he will surprise you in this one with his quirky accent and actions.  I really don't understand the negative reviews of this film.  I can only imagine that the reviewers expected something else when going to see it.  It's a complex film with intertwining stories with a tragic end.  This film is not The Illusionist, it's better (sorry I just had to compare).<br /><br />This is a great film that everyone should enjoy, and is worth watching over and over again.r he will surprise you in this one with his quirky accent and actions.

B000N6TX1S|5.0|I am shocked at some of the negative reviews about this films. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I didn't find it hard to understand in the first viewing :shrug:. I really think this film should have been in the running for best picture. It is a unique vision of the future that delves into the psyche of the human race in general. I think a lot of people seem to concentrate on the little things and not see the big picture as a whole. But this film has a staggering scope to it. I will say this, if you like your films simple, with your standard plot twists, good guy wins everytime, and and all threads wrapped up into a neat little bow. If you like them as a distraction and not as intellectual entertainment. Then this is not the film for you. If you like depth, complex characters, and a message that isn't always what people would like it to be, and you like to come out of a film discussing it afterward. Then you will like this film. The cinematography is top notch, with an involving documentary style approach and shots so long it makes John Woo's Hard Boiled shots look like a reaction shot. There is a lot to like in this movie, great character acting, a good tense script, and involving camera work. But as I said it may not be for everyone. Oh and get the widescreen, you miss so much when they cut the sides off.
1400032717|3.0|All you ever wanted to know and more about how the \\"high-functioning\\" autistic brain perceives. Was interesting for awhile but got old very quick.     Maybe if you were a \\"high-functioning autistic or were a new parent of an autistic child you would appreciate this book.

And as our world confuses and frustrates them, theirs confuses and frustrates us.     Sympathy? You got it. I wouldn't know what to do if I had an autistic child. The pain of having caused this would be overwhelming. And in fact that's why I never had kids. I have HBV and HCV.     There is some interesting info in this book and it motivated me to seek more.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|3 1/2 Stars    I think the reason A Good Year has gotten such mediocre reviews is that people are expecting Russell Crowe to shoot off fireworks, no matter the picture.  There isn't some deep message, or psychological drama here.  If you watch it with an open mind, and don't go in expecting it to be great, then it is an enjoyable movie.  Crowe looks like he is having a great time here, not having to worry about Oscar chances.  He comes off as an arrogant businessman, and that's what his character is.  This is a fun movie, nothing more, and nothing less.
B0000026NC|5.0|I cannot understand how can someone rate this cd as a one star... <br />This was a great concert, I was there in the first row, it was simply amazing.  You have the best of \\"Momentary lapse\\" in live version plus some great classics from Pink Floyd in the 70's <br />Of course, Roger Waters is missing and he was the spirit of the band but you have to admit that a band can still offer great versions without his bass player. Don't get me wrong, I prefer Pink Floyd with Roger in the band.  I am a huge fan of Roger Waters and I have great respect for the man and his work, but David also was a great contribution in the sound and he does a very good job with this live set.   My only complaint is for two great moment of the concert that has not been included, these are \\"Great gig in the sky\\" and \\"Echoes\\", yes \\"Echoes\\" was the opening track for this concert, those who were there surely remember !
0618680004|2.0|The Blind Watchmaker was an excellent book, where Dawkins applied his scientific skill to explaining the scientific process of evolution.  In The God Delusion, he attempts to provide a scientific perspective on one of the greatest philosophical questions of all time.  To succeed, such a cross-disciplinary approach needs to be carried out with great skill, but surprisingly he makes some elementary blunders in both the science and the philosophy. <br /> <br />The wrong hypothesis <br />-------------------- <br />Dawkins' approach is to put forward a very specific \\"God Hypothesis\\" with three components, disprove it, and thereby conclude that there is no God.  Whilst this may sound reasonable, as some scientists have publicly stated (eg: see this book's entry in wikipedia) it is not scientific.  For example, even if this particular God Hypothesis were untrue, there may be other God Hypotheses that are true.  He should have put forward the hypothesis that there is no God, and proved or disproved that assertion. <br /> <br />Conflation of \\"disproof\\" with \\"lack of evidence\\" <br />-------------------------------------------- <br />Dawkins doesn't actually 'disprove' his God hypothesis.  He merely shows that there is an absence of evidence to support it and argues that it is improbable.  The absence of evidence for something, or its being improbable, does not disprove it. <br /> <br />Avoids philosophical questions of 'existence' <br />---------------------------------------- <br />Dawkins says \\"either God exists or he doesn't, it is a scientific question\\".  In appropriating for science what is traditionally seen as a philosophical question he has glossed over some basic questions of the nature of existence.  For example, does \\"love\\" exist, or pity, or compassion?  In how many dimensions is existence?  God exists as a \\"concept\\", so exactly what type of \\"existence\\" is he denying?  Without addressing these and similar topics, the question \\"Does God exist?\\" becomes meaningless.<br /> <br />Avoids paradox <br />-------------- <br />Dawkins says that he \\"decries supernaturalism in all its forms.. I am not attacking any particular version of God or gods.  I am attacking God, all gods, anything and everything supernatural, wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented.\\"  Such prejudice is not only unscientific but it also inhibits inquiry and learning, because human understanding is advanced by looking at both sides of paradox.  But he has already decided in advance not to entertain anything that is paradoxical when compared with his scientific perspective.   <br /> <br />Conclusion <br />---------- <br />I think there is a degree of truth in this book, in that each of us creates our own image of God (from vacuous concept to loving father to tyrannical despot).  So in that sense there is always an element of delusion in our God-image.  However, although Dawkins refers to Thomas Aquinas, he fails to reach the starting line of the debate Aquinas started about the relationships there might be between philosophical, religious and biological functioning, a debate moved on by work such as Victor White's God and The Unconscious.  That Dawkins should think he has disproved the existence of God in this book is perhaps itself a delusion. <br /> <br />However, despite its many shortcomings, you may still want to buy the book for lots of reasons.  It is one of those texts that will be referred to for many years.  It will start a debate that may lead to better thought-through conclusions than the book itself presents.  The book provides a good summary of many arguments for and against God.  Though it also misses out some very important evidence such as studies of mythology and the unconscious.  And it stands as a example of what Carl Jung warned was the modern one-sided scientific/rational consciousness.  And it also makes interesting reading, despite its faults.  But it is very surprising that the Chair for the Public Understanding of Scienceat Oxford University should produce a book that is more pseudo-science than genuine scientific inquiry. <br />
B000002AGN|5.0|If you want to build your jazz collection from the start, this must be one of your first cd's, along with Miles' Kind Of Blue. It's instantly accessible, for  those whoe are jazz-phobic, however, it stands the test of sonic-time, as it still sounds fresh almost 50 years later.
B000002KDX|5.0|As a young boy growing up in sunny California, this LP was as much a part of my childhood as any.  The fact that it includes 2 top 10 hits, makes it all the more accessible, however, there is no deeper collection of America songs than on this debut record.  Of the 12 compostions, 6 were written by Dewey Bunnell, and at the tender age of 19, he would never be in such fine form again.  In addtion to A Horse with No Name, he penned  Riverside, 3 Roses, Sandman, Children and Pigeon Song, 5 which are featured on side 1, and form the glue that marks this LP as an important part of the early 70s West Coast music.  In addition to Beckley's I Need You, he contributed the quite thoughtful Here as well as Clarice.  While I always believed that Dan Peek was the weakest songwriter in the band, his guitar work and harmony vocals were prominent in this largely acoustic setting.  Most songs are backed by only acoustic guitars (6 and sometime 12 string) bass and percussion, and the groups beautiful blend of vocals, both lead and harmony.<br /><br />Although the critics have largely panned their work, the band obviously touched a cord with the musical tastes of 70's listerners, as many of these songs (Sandman, 3 Roses and Riverside are 3 that I distinctly recall) were played by DJs here in California, when FM radio was wide open and not subject to the todays strict adherence to playlists.<br /><br />In short, this record is a gem, and shows that the band peaked early, which I guess is better than not peaking at all.  In my mind, they would not capture the quality and breadth found here with any of their subsequent records/CDs.<br /><br />I still have the LP, issued by Warner Brothers, with the faded tropical artwork on the album's label marking.  It would be one that I would take with me, if I were forced to make a shortlist of records to take on a deserted island.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|first let me say I have all of Meatloafs CDs, most replaced the records I have. That being said, this outing does NOT deserve to wear the Bat Out of Hell title. Meatloaf himself is still great, but this is the worst Meatloaf album I've heard. VERY few highlights on this one and none that I would speak of. This CD will remain on my shelf forever!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I've read Pride and Prejudice a couple of times, and loved the story, the characters (especially Elizabeth and Darcy), and Austen's humor. The miniseries from the mid 1990s with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was fantastic too, with Firth as a perfect a Darcy as could be, and the whole thing capturing the spirit of the book. I heard a couple rave reviews of this adaptation, so I thought I'd check it out. Let's just say I want my two hours back. It's horrible. It's chopped way down so you just get a shell of the story, perhaps a cliff's notes version. You know what's going on, but you never get much of the wit and development. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters, like I did in the book and the miniseries. In those I was falling for Mr. Darcy right along with Elizabeth and wanting them together. In this version the characters just don't come to life. I didn't care what happened. And on top of that, despite the editing down of a classic to bare bones story, they still tossed in a lot of filler, lots of shots with some piano music tinkling away, and it's like, you couldn't have put a few more good lines of dialogue, explain more of the goings on? Anything? It just doesn't capture the spirit of the book; it's a lazy man's Austen. Bridget Jones' Diary (the movie, anyways, I didn't read the book), better caught the spirit of 'Pride and Prejudice,' with Firth as Darcy  (naturally) and Hugh Grant as Wickham, the crazy mom being the crazy mom with a bit of Lydia's drama thrown in. Rent that instead if you want a lighter version, or give the book and the miniseries a chance. It'll take longer to get through, but it's worth the time.
B000002B35|5.0|I still don't understand how can someone rate this as a one star album. <br />You are a great fan of Pink Floyd, you gave Dark side a five star rating and you hate this cd ?  Maybe you should see a doctor.   <br />The Dark side version is nearly perfect, plus you have other classics in very good live version and the best from \\"Division Bell\\" <br />Yes I am a Roger Waters fan and I know he was the genious and spirit of the band but one should admit that David, Rick and Nick also contributed to what was Pink Floyd and make some effort to appreciate their works on this great double cd live set. You don't have to hate the rest of the band only because Roger left the band...
1904233023|2.0|With many dear friends who worship this book, I really, really wanted to like it. I'm not a sci-fi newbie, having read virtually everything by Bradbury, Asimov, Henry Kuttner, and many others. Orson Card writes a very pedestrian novel here, with yet-another Messianic \\"The ONE\\" (a la Star Wars, the Matrix, the Wizard of OZ, Bible) thread about THE BOY (a heavily misogynistic tale) who will save mankind. The \\"this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you\\" style of Officer Training that 6-year old Ender Wiggin is put into would make an excellent model for suicide bomber camps everywhere. In fact, I'll bet it does!<br /><br />Peter, the character who embodies pure evil, is as beguiling as Eddy Haskell from \\"Leave it to Beaver\\", but while the Cleavers could see straight through Eddy from the start, NO ADULT, but only Peter's young sister, can see him for what he is. Of course she is powerless to stop him, or resist him.<br /><br />Everyone asked me to reflect on the \\"twist\\" in the story at the end. When I finally choked this whole thing down, I was bewildered. TWIST? Have you people ever read anything else? Yes, it takes a tad bit unexpected turn at the end, and I'm told that I REALLY REALLY should try the more-sophisticated sequel. That's okay. I still have plenty of other things to read and enjoy.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Leave it to George Martin, and his son, apparently- (Sir George is now partially deaf- a word of caution to all you headphone blasters), to make an incredibly well put together conglomeration of some of the Beatles' best- smoothly integrated from song to song, bringing a slightly new light to their old chestnuts. If somehow youre new to the Beatles, this is a great CD to start your lifelong appreciation of this groundbreaking and timeless group, or if you're like me, you can remember when they were on the Ed Sullivan show, you owe it to yourself to pick up this CD. One warning- it deserves to be heard from start to finish, to truly appreciate the technological and aural beauty of this CD. It's no wonder it got the seal of approval from Paul and oh-no Yoko. I would imagine the show from which this emanates is equally astounding.
B000NHPCS0|2.0|Great story, excellent acting, but....what ruined this movie for me was the excessive use of profanity and vulgarity; I think I heard enough of the \\"F\\" word enough to last me a lifetime (two and three times in a sentence is a little too much for me).  I should have walked out of the movie, but the intrigue and suspense kept me there.  It this REALLY how the Boston police speak??  This is a very dark movie.
B0000255CL|5.0|This Immortal release was extremely good. The first thing I have to say about it was how wonderful the isntrumentals were. They were unlike any instrumentals I've ever heard in black metal. They weren't extremely and overbearingly heavy to the point where it just sounds like noise, but they weren't extremely soft either. I'd describe them as metal with a little edge of hard rock (only a speck though...do not think this is a rock album).  <br /> <br />The vocals were also pretty good. Sometimes I wish they were a bit more intense, but they are still pretty good.  <br /> <br />Overall, this CD is amazing. Never heard any other black metal CD as good as this one. BUY IT.
B000002A3T|3.0|I have to agree with many reviewers this time.  We are light year away from a true Pink Floyd album, the spirit is not here and the music is quite near to pop sometimes.  We have some good tracks hidden in the cd, the best one is \\"High Hopes\\", the other interesting cuts are intrumental, \\"Cluster One\\" and \\"Marooned\\" The other track are just OK but far from memorable composition. \\"Wearing the inside out\\" is a real joke. <br />
B000NMW6M0|5.0|This should have won the \\"Best Movie\\" Oscar 2006, rather than \\"The Departed\\". \\"Babel\\" is beautiful because it plays out like real life, very different from a typical Hollywood production. The story (actually three stories)unfolds in parallel, in a non-linear way. The actors are so good, so natural, that they don't seem like they're acting. Even Brad Pitt manages to look like a believable character, though he is overshadowed by the supporting actresses in the three interwoven stories. There is constant suspense, but it is the suspense of real life. In many ways, the film is so realistic it feels like a documentary. This is not your \\"Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, Pirates Of The Caribbean\\" entertainment piece. It is a profound look into the drama of real life , in which people with the best of intentions get entagled in nasty events, and may even die because of that. It reminds one of \\"Crash\\", which also told parallel stories, but \\"Babel\\" feels so real that \\"Crash\\" looks like a teen movie by comparison.
B000002UCN|3.0|The three stars isn't for the music; needless to say, the music's great! But George had put out quite a few things since 1976, and for this antiquated album to serve as his sole career retrospective is truly a pity. I can only presume that this situation will be rectified soon, and considering the class and attention lavished on his recently re-released regular albums, it will be worth the wait.
006056251X|5.0|Although I still have to read the last book in the series, I will say that this is surely the best book of the four. A reformed rake, Sebastain, meets his match in the most shy of the Wallflowers, Eve and their story has truly surpassed the other books in terms of the romance, passion, tenderness and the gut wrenching emotions!  Please read the entire series and make sure you buy them all at once because once you finish a book, you won't want to wait to start the next one!
B000LE1FAY|4.0|I saw a poster for this and had no idea what to think.  So many good reviews, though, so I bought it.   <br /> <br />I love it. <br /> <br />Her voice, which can sound think when she sings in english, really works on these songs. <br /> <br />It's been in heavy rotation for a week.  Everyone loves it.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|The acting in this movie was very good.  That's where my compliments end.  I thought the movie was too long, the plot convoluted and the soundtrack distracting.  It used to be cool how Scorsese used rock/pop music to juxtapose violence, now it's just routine.  I also have not noticed anybody mention that Dicaprio and Damon look too similar to give their opposition much flair.  Another problem I had was the way too convenient plot device that puts the therapist in bed with both characters.  It's doubtful to me that a professional therapist would get involved with a patient who starts ranting about suicide and demanding drugs, especially when she has just gotten involved in a committed relationship.  But then again, women are never very smart in Scorsese films.  Finally, the ending just left this viewer empty and wondering why I wasted my time with these sleazebags.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|Slow and had to turn it off because whole family disliked it. Not recommended.
1582701709|4.0|If you are into self-help, then this is one of many postive-thinking books that are out there. I don't understand why people are down grading Ms. Byrne because she's written something that has already been done before. Yes, this is true. The Secret is not new, it is also known as the law of attraction, and you will find many books on the subject; however, I must state that Ms. Byrne's style is what is making this book do so well, not specifically the subject matter, but how she wrote it. So, yes, if you have already read/learned about the law of attraction from someone or someplace else, then this is not the book for you. I believe you will find it redundant and boring; However, if this is your first experience with the law of attraction, then Ms. Byrne will take you on an easy to grasp self-help path and you will learn how to attract the things you want most in your life.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|Lots of very good actors, but they used the \\"F\\" word about six times a minute.  After the first 15 minutes of the constant bombbardment of bad langauge, I could not watch it any more and took it out of the player.  The story seemed ok and could have been told without all the bad langauge.
B000LC55F2|5.0|<br />Magic is a pleasure bred deep within us all. If for a moment we can be taken away from a world that has become normal, we call that magic. Reading a fantasy novel can be magical, seeing a wonderful film can be magical, noticing an intimate moment in the world can be magical. <br /> <br />The Prestige is truly a magical movie. While it's plot focuses on magic and illusions, the real magic comes in the portrayal of human emotions in this movie. The Prestige is a story of love; a story of obsessions, revenge, identities, and trickery all done in the name of love. Love can become obsessive at times. Love for another person or love for perfection. <br /> <br />The movie follows two rival magicians in London. Both are trying to achieve the ultimate performance. What starts off as a friendship ends in a competition so fierce that nothing is forsaken. Both magicians strive for the secret (or the prestige) of the others trick. What one has the other wants. I don't want to say too much more as I don't want to give away the movie for those who have not seen it. But it is wonderful, and I would recommend buying this one rather than renting it. You'll want to see it again as soon as it's over. <br /> <br />The acting was superb in this movie. I'm becoming more and more of a Christian Bale fan. I've always liked him, but I've only recently come to respect him so much as an actor. He was amazing in this movie. The surprise performance of the movie for me was David Bowie as Nikolha Tesla. He was wonderful! I expected his acting to be forced, but it was perfect. Nods to him. Hugh Jackman is wonderful as always, as is the gorgeous Scarlett Johansen. I've come to find that I like just about any movie that she is in. Michael Caine is wonderful as always and has that same charm that he always has. <br /> <br />The movie was filmed beautifully and captured the era perfectly. Every scene has a eerie yet comforting darkness about it and it is the total lack of special effects that makes this movie so wonderful and so authentic. The story relies much more on human emotions and interaction than the magic itself. I would've been happy with just a movie about magic, but what makes The Prestige so wonderful is that it does an amazing job at portraying the human psyche and the lengths that we go to for obsessions and for perfection. <br />
1400079276|5.0|5 star for his insight into life and what makes people tick--great translation--must be read slowly to savor and get it all--great imagination in presentation of content.   dick jones
B000M4RG42|1.0|Constant flashbacks make it difficult to follow and to be engaged with the movie. It also drags in many places. As a result I did not feel sympathetic, connected, and emotional for the characters. I did not  enjoy it. The book is much more touching and enjoyable.<br /><br />Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, the Longest Day, the Lost Battalion, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals are still the only titles on my list of Best War Movies of All Times.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Too scary for children and too childish for the adult audience, Terry Gilliam's THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a huge disappointment. Of course, the special effects are very well made, of course, the German countryside and its disturbing forests are on the screen, of course the costumes and the scenery are superb. But I didn't find in the movie the pleasure I had listening to the brothers Grimm's fairy tales or reading their collections of stories. Everyone knows by now, thanks to Bruno Bettelheim's \\"The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales\\", that fairy tales are narrations filled with a symbolic meaning destined to children; you may watch the movie as often as you want, there isn't an ounce of allegory or second degree in it. This is only pure first degree entertainment, a wild ride through a dozen fairy tales of which the screenwriter kept only the exotic and hair-raising flavour. Too bad.<br /><br />A DVD zone disillusion.
B00005JOCU|5.0|I saw this movie the very first day it came out. I ended up going to two theaters just to see it. Just for the record, I love Jennifer Hudson in this movie. Her voice is so strong and she really sings from her heart. I cried when she sang \\"And I'm Telling You (I'm not Going)\\". It was hard for me to take Eddie Murphy serious in this film, but he did excellent and has a nice voice. Jamie Foxx; I love him, he is such a versatile actor. The part was perfect for him. I didn't too much care for Beyonce, although I think this is the best film she has done so far. I just recently purchased the soundtrack and as soon as it comes out on dvd, I will be purchasing that as well. I was tempted to go see it in theater again, but I'll wait.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie  it is fast and quick paced and very enchanting. My husband was even captivated. I know it is an abreviated version of the book..... but the film captures the flavor and essence so well.  A very deeply layered film with love life family and missunderstandings between the two lead characters that in the end get resolved for the most wonderful of endings. Lizzie is accertive, confident unpretentious ...... convincing and real... that is what I love about her. She does not pull any punches.<br />The scenes are lavish the acting superb. This movie capivates and pulls one right in.<br />I recomend  This movie very very highly. I own it now proudly and have and will view it many times over
B000059T1E|5.0|\\"John Barleycorn\\" has in common with much of the Beatles' work that -- even if you've listened to it a thousand times -- when you come back it sounds as fresh and new as the very first listening. <br /> <br />The entire album is great--and covers an amazing amount of \\"musical territory.\\" It would be on my short list of nominees for \\"greatest album of all time.\\" <br /> <br />Let me also add that I was fortunate enough to see the briefly-reunited Traffic at Columbia, MD's Merriweather Post Pavilion (the year may have been 1994), not too long after the release of their much-underrated \\"Far From Home\\" - a fine album in its own right. It was a concert for the ages. Among his many other talents, Winwood is a superb guitarist.
B000A7S4B0|1.0|I was all set to buy this CD when I was scared off my the SunnComm MediaMax 5 warning.  I don't really feel like spending my hard earned cash on a CD which will automatically install software on my computer even when if I tell it not to (i.e. clicking \\"Cancel\\" after it Autoruns). <br /> <br />If Sony-BMG ever decide to release this CD without copy protection, I will gladly purchase this title.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|Ghost Rider is a great action and redemption movie. Well played by Nicholas Cage, Johnny Blaze is a character who faces personal demons inaugurated by a deal when he was a teenager to sell his soul to Mephistopheles and, in resolve, chooses to take actions to the right the wrongs associated with the aforementioned decision made so long ago. <br /> <br />The style of the film screenwriting is most apt. Yes, Ghost Rider, thus Johnny Blaze, is a tormented soul, but he deals with his adversities by kicking the butts of bad guys and \\"riding and burning out\\" their core beings. There is that fight versus flight introspection as you might expect, but it is not annoyingly prolonged as it is in other motion pictures that, because of this particular psychological element overuse, fall short of being considered great. <br /> <br />Though humorous at times, the stark and lighthearted moments are well-separated, signaling that the producers and screenwriters at least made an attempt for the Ghost Rider to be taken seriously in Comicdom.
0143038419|1.0|Eat, Pray, Love -- lots of great material there, you would think.  But this book is all about Gilbert and her not very original life crisis.  A great disappointment.
B00005JM02|2.0|i don't know why Disney movies seem to need to kill off the mother - it's as if kids can't dream of a big life if their mom's around... but it starts with Nemo's mom being eaten, then Nemo's in danger, my 3 year old couldn't take it - she's a kid with anxiety though so, maybe a normal kid who watches a lot of bright loud t.v. would have no problem...<br /><br />Heck just turn of the t.v. and give the kid a book!  That's what I really meant to say.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Brad Pitt should have been nominated and should have won the Oscar for his performance in Babel.  The movie is far better than Crash.  At first, I wasn't sure I would like the movie, with no subtitles but then I realized I didn't need the subtitles - I knew what they were saying.  Rent the movie, it is so good.
B000002JSZ|5.0|Great hooks on this album.   <br /> <br />It was probably less successful commercially because it's sonically identical to Back in Black and For this About to Rock; the band started to sound repetitive.  But as it stands alone, Flick of the Switch has some super riffs,chord sequences and that cool guitar syncopation that defines AC/DC.  Plus the Young bro's guitar tone is as great as ever and Johnson's voice is at full wack. <br /> <br />My second favourite with Johnson after Back in Black, with only Powerage being better from the Scott era.  Overall, I reckon \\"Flick\\" is at least as good or better than the much more popular \\"Highway to Hell\\", \\"Let there be Rock\\" and \\"Dirty Deeds\\".
B000009F3Z|5.0|A freind told me these guys rock so I went and picked up the CD. At first I was really upset because of the grunting vocals. However the guitars, drum and bass are out of this world - the combination being some of the best I've ever heard. The production is real good too with good clear sound. I just wish a band with this kind of talent would toss the death vocals. If someone like Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden took over it would be scary how far these guys could go. Even though I hate the grunting I'll still give this a 5 star, because I would recommend to any metal fan. Will I buy more from this group? I don't think so, this is where my death metal begins and ends but at least I picked a good one.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Not only did I love the movie, but I also loved this soundtrack! If you loved the movie, you will love the soundtrack, because this soundtrack  captures the essence of this movie. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore have  great voices! They had the perfect chemistry in the movie! You will remember the movie by just listening to all the songs on the soundtrack. It will take you back to how you felt after you left the theater after seeing this movie. Nothing is missing on this soundtrack!
B00005V9IJ|5.0|I never would have guessed Cast Away could deliver such good emotion.  The fact that the film starts off with so much human activity and communication which leads into Tom Hanks on an island by himself with hardly any voices being heard at all makes this a really great story.   <br /> <br />On an island by yourself having to do whatever it takes to survive can be a serious struggle, and that's what the film is about- trying to find ways to survive.  I love everything about this movie.  I would love to see it again.  I recommend this film to just about everyone.  Even if you're a fan of horror movies, take a break from that and watch this great movie.  It's not a horror flick obviously, but it's worth your time.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I generally can't stand Ben Stiller movies.  They are usually far too crass for my enjoyment and I've turned more than one of his movies off early.  I'd heard good things about this from my wife's family over in England (having spent many years living in England my sense of humor slants in that direction and British humor IS different)  so I gave it a shot.  Zoolander has some really great visual moments (in the coal mine hiding against the wall covered in black coal dust and then opening those eyes and grinning) and lots of subtle gags about vantity.  David Duchovny as the world's greatest hand model \\"We're an entirely different kind of animal\\" was literally unrecognizable until he started to speak.<br /><br />Some of the dialog in the \\"tea party\\" scene was unecessary but it wasn't too offensive really.<br /><br />There are many momentary cameos in Zoolander, I'm sure I didn't catch them all.  I saw Billy Zane, David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, Claudia Shiffrin (I think) and a bunch of other people I recognized but couldn't name.<br /><br /> The scene at the gas station with the male models when a harmless game of flinging winshield washer fluid at one another escalates into playfully spraying/drenching one another with gasoline (with Wham's Wake Me Up Before You Go Go playing in the background) in an all out gasoline war...  I had tears in my eyes, it was so ridiculous, and laughed 'til I cried again when they showed the memorial fountain for the gasoline warriors at the \\"Zoolander School for Children Who Can't Read Good and Want to Learn Other Stuff\\"  Hilarious!  One of the funniest gag scenes of all time, really!<br /><br />Don't mind the professional critics and their bad reviews, they often get it wrong and did this time.  Yes it is over the top silly but in a way that will make you laugh yourself silly.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|I found Poseidon to be a film that had great special effects but hardly anything was done to make the characters interesting.  They just appeared there and we were expected to care about them surviving the sinking ship.   <br /> <br />The beginning of the film is supposed to be when we get to know and care about all the main characters, but hardly anything was done to make them worth caring about.  So when they were running towards the top of the ship in an attempt to escape the rising flood, it just wasn't that great.  I DID care about that little boy who almost didn't make it towards the end of the film.  That was a memorable segment. <br /> <br />I can't deny the special effects are really good, and watching the movie on DVD is a whole other experience with the incredibly loud sounds of waves crashing against the boat and all sorts of ship destruction, but besides that, the film was pretty average and didn't tell as good a story as it probably should have.
B00006L83N|5.0|Ok, this was my intro to Symphony X, and an unexpected one. <br /> <br />It turned out to be one of those rare finds, the kind that stay in your mp3 player weeks on end.  <br /> <br />Many of the other reviewers have covered this as well as I could. I just wish this band had better recognition in the States, they really deserve it on many levels - the musicianship, the music, the vocals, each and every member is a star and stands out. <br /> <br />For those that would dismiss this as another million-notes-a-minute act, there is really much, much more to these guys. The only thing I criticize them on is their limited catalog, and lack of a good DVD - bring more of it on guys, your break is coming! <br /> <br />But careful of this as your first SX album, it's great, and others are really good, but this is a tough act to follow.
B000FS9FCG|2.0|While the movie started off rather ridiculously fake with all sorts of unusual voice acting, it eventually got better.  The only problem was the entire story wasn't interesting enough to care about, so after 50% of the film went by, I really lost interest.  I also didn't care for the slow motion effects showing people dying and blood squirting from their bodies.  The V character was decent, but he can't save an average film.  Some of the special effects were good (such as that exploding clock) but that's about the only thing worth noting I found about the film.
B00001OH7O|4.0|I have to say that I am not as big a fan of this album as I am of the records that bookend it. That being said, I can appreciate the praise heaped on 'Hunky Dory', probably the most celebrated of Bowie's albums. Released in the late fall of 1971, a great year for classic rock, David's fourth record was a rather humble success at first. This record is sonically a vast detour from 'Man Who Sold the World' as hard rock barely makes an appearance (notable exception being pre-Ziggy era taster \\"Queen Bitch\\" - a tribute to Bowie idol Lou Reed). However lyrically the album revists many of the same themes as its predecessor (distrust of religion, insanity and a future race of \\"Homo Superior\\"). \\"Changes\\" is the classic every rock fan knows and it was surprisingly not a hit when it originally appeared. David seems to be outdistancing his contemporaries (\\"look out you rock n' rollers.\\") and was seen as arrogant by many critics (who is this onehit wonder to believe he is above what the Beatles had done??, They seemed to be saying). \\"Life on Mars?\\" is an admitted tribute to Frank Sinatra's \\"My Way\\" but would also prove to be one of his most lasting compostions. \\"Kooks\\" is his witty celebration of being a new father (and along with \\"Fill Your Heart\\" reminicent of songs from his first lp in 1967.) Much of the second half of the record is taken up by a series of tributes to Bowies favorites - \\"Andy Warhol\\", \\"Song for Dylan\\" (with a Dylanesque vocal!) and the aforementioned \\"Queen Bitch\\". My personal favorite is the epic like \\"Quicksand\\", as powerful as an entirely acoustically driven song can be (\\"ain't got the power anymore\\"). This has been called Bowie's singer-songwriter's record and is probably true, though he was not opening copying a certain artist's style. Commercial acceptance would come with the next lp - and then the phenomenon would begin.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|What a *fantastic* emotional album Bridge Over Troubled Water is.  It's almost funny to me that this album was released almost on the same date as Black Sabbath's debut!  This just goes to show how diverse and interesting the rock scene was back in the late 60's and 70's. <br /> <br />Anyone who loves taking an emotional roller-coaster ride will get a HUGE amount of satisfaction out of this album.  Simply put- a must have.  You will love this album now, and probably for the rest of your life.  Buy it right now.
0887306101|5.0|A read through Market Wizards will magically transform the way you think about making money in the market.  This is not an academic book presenting theories on trading.  Market Wizards allows you to learn from the experience of the pros, showing you the thinking that went into their strategies to make them a success.  Most of these traders started with nearly scratch and compounded their winnings to millions.  Now through the eyes of Jack Schwager, decades of lessons learned from trial and error are handed to you within this small book.<br /><br />To get the full benefit, it is necessary to read from beginning to end.  What strikes me most is both the depth and breadth covered by the interviews.  The book is divided into several segments, covering futures, equities, investors who follow economy-wide trends, and a little bit of psychological analysis.  The key to learning from this book is linking the ideas from all the separate interviews together.<br /><br />By the end, you will see subtle differences in the thinking behind futures, equities, and even stock option trading.  Despite the various traders having a wide range of opinions and philosophies, you will find many commonalities in each interview.  Though each trader used radically different methods, they all had a standardized set of rules that were followed and led to success.  Most of these rules involved some benchmark for cutting losses.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this book is not written or condensed in anyway.  It consists of outright transcripts of interviews Schwager conducted with the actual traders.  I believe this style kept each page exciting because it actually felt as if I was present during the interview.<br /><br />This is one of the essential reads for any young or old person wanting to engage the trading field, whether as a part time endeavor or as a career.  Study Market Wizards, and use the wisdom of its pages to your money-making advantage!
B000025XKM|5.0|listening to this cd is always a profound emotional experience for me. i can't pinpoint one or two songs that make the album great, though i do have my favorites. every song is beautiful on both a superficial and deep level: through the transparent and lush beauty of every track, it is almost impossible not to feel the crushing sense of doom in drake's delivery. the songs are haunting, ethereal, and jaw-droppingly beautiful.  <br /> <br />drake was without a doubt a superb musician: he was both a masterful guitar player, with a fingerpicking technique unlike any other; and a beautiful and heartfelt vocalist. his dusky, sensitive voice managed to be both bashful and intense at the same time. parallels have frequently been drawn between drake's guitar playing and that of hendrix; once you get past their stylistic differences, you'll find that they were remarkably similar (and equally skilled guitar players). perhaps the most remarkable thing about drake's guitar playing was his ability to create the richest soundscape of any of his albums with only himself and his voice (previous albums were elaborately orchestrated). it is easy to forget that it was only drake and his guitar, save for the sparse and brief piano line of the title track. <br /> <br />to be fully appreciated, this album should be listened to intently and thoroughly. giving it half of your attention is almost a crime: although you will certainly enjoy the almost-soothing quality of drake's voice and his gorgeous melodies, you will not be able to feel the deep and profound beauty of drake's emotions that are so intricately woven into the fabric of every song. <br /> <br />it's hard to believe that such great beauty could come out of such horrible darkness, and i am brought to tears when i realize that one person had the capacity to make something as amazing as 'pink moon'. in an ironic way, this album gives me hope that the rest of humanity has the capacity to create things equally beautiful. nick drake was inspiring simply because of his ability to create such beauty. his work transcended the world of darkness that he lived in, while remaining true to it and never being anything other than authentic. 'pink moon' continues, more than 30 years after his death, to shine like a bright beacon, here to remind us that we all have the capacity to create light out of darkness. i'm sure if drake knew what a legacy his work would eventually leave, his world would have been a lot brighter.
1400049628|4.0|This is a good book to read after you have read Max Brooks' excellent first novel, \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\" I completely agree with the reviewers who said \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is not funny (or if it is, it's the driest humor ever). However, it is a heck of a good read, especially after \\"World War Z.\\" Think of it as a work of non-narrative fiction, and it's worth reading.

0374105235|3.0|This bloody, heart-wrenching account of losing your family and being forced, as a child, to become a solider is very well- written.  I didn't enjoy reading this but  the sense of urgency and loss stamped my soul with greater understanding. Beah's description of living in the forests by himself is really beautiful and so sad. This slender book illuminates the horrors of life in a country few Americans, myself included,  know nothing about.
B000EQ5TSI|5.0|I think this movie was rated bad by people because it was so different from the first one. I went to watch this movie thinking it was going to be long, kinda drab but still in its own way interesting like the first. But instead it added a few things that the first one could have used like ACTION. I think this movie was a good combination of a modern action movie well balanced with      <br />technical expertise and suspense. This movie had a sexy feel that flowed smoothly throughout the movie that just kept you hook until the end. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt. Anthony hopkin and Ving Rhames where also  good elements added for this movie.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|The film, Thank you for smoking, is an indie classic. It really sheds light on this country's obsession with image and spin control. The film is hilarious but yet makes the viewer think. It's a nice change of pace compared to the normal Hollywood formula. The writing is tight and always moving forward. Dialogue is also very well done and keeps the viewer's interest. The casting was very interesting and all did great jobs with their performances.   <br /> <br />Aaron Eckhart is a perfect fit for the main character. One of the subplots is the development of a great relationship between him and his son that was very heart warming. I also enjoyed the acting of Katie Holmes. Ultimately, I feel this movie is about individual choice and free will and does a great job of presenting it.               <br />
B00005JKNF|4.0|\\"A Prairie Home Companion\\" was an entertaining coda, but \\"Gosford Park\\" is truly Robert Altman's last great film, in which he applied his distinctive touch--the roving camera, bountiful casts with tight ensemble performances, overlapping dialogue--to another genre that for him was unexplored territory: the English drawing-room murder mystery. Beyond the movie's cheerful performances, the neat twist here that Altman and screenwriter Julian Fellowes's turn is on class distinctions, internal hierarchies within classes, and how members of those classes cannot keep from intersecting with one another. \\"Gosford Park\\" is Altman's answer to Agatha Christie, even as \\"The Long Goodbye\\" is his take on Raymond Chandler. Not since William Wellman has a single director approached such a range of movie genres and impressed on them such a distinctive stamp.
0783240236|5.0|\\"The Birds\\" is only the second Hitchock film I've ever seen, and I can see why people call it one of his masterpie<br /><br />ces. The film shows us something that we'd never imagine happening in a way that truly makes us look at birds in a different light. Honestly, when was the last time you looked at a seagull and didn't think of this film? Apart from the thrills this film is interesting. The scene where they debate the birds' onslaught in the diner is one of my favorite movie scenes ever, probably because it makes their attack all the more impossible. Truly one of the creepiest films ever made and likely won't be surpassed by any that try to imitate it.<br /><br />One question: are the DVD extras any good, particularly \\"All About 'The Birds'?\\"
B000026FOA|5.0|Some reviewers are critical of Volkswagen's use of Pink Moon in one of their commercials. I'm not. I praise it.  <br />I lived in Germany when the commercial was aired the first time, - it came on TV one late night. And like many other viewers, I was hypnotized. <br />Did we all run out to buy cars? No. But we all called or wrote to VW, to ask who the singer was. <br />After that, I have always had a warm little spot in my heart for VW, becaused they introduced Nick Drake to the world. Money here, and money there. I still believe there was a large part heart in the making of that commercial. <br />
B000M5AJQS|1.0|The constant use of the foulest language was a real turnoff.  I stayed with it to the end hoping it would have a satisfactory conclusion.  It didn't. The film left me with so many questions I spent hours reading message boards hoping to find clarity.  There are so many theories and contradictory explanations that I'm giving up.  Some even suggest Martin Sheen's and/or Mark Wahlberg's characters were in league with the mobsters. I didn't get that impression at all. That people came away with different perceptions illustrates how poorly the plot was executed.   I wish there was a director's cut with additional footage that would clearly define the characters and tie up all the loose ends.   <br />
0765348276|4.0|Heinleinian but not Heinlein. Like Starship Troopers or not so much. A comparison to RH may be a little too much of an endorsement. Anyway, this book can stand alone without all that. <br /> <br />This book is fun and entertaining. It isn't what I would call hard sci-fi although it has space elevators, alternate universes and space travel, brain pattern transference, tachyons, etc. It is mostly about modified humans warring with a variety of aliens over real estate, resources, and possibly religion. Spattered blood and guts and all that. <br /> <br />Get the hard cover book if you can: the artwork is worth it.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|*semi-spoiler, no real details about the ending, just the feel of it    Anyone who is a fan of Scorsese's films owes it to themself to see this movie.  Nobody does a mob movie like him.  The Departed is excellent.  It's paced well, the acting is great, the violence isn't excessive (in my opinion, a lot of people mention how they don't like the violent ending but come on, its a mob movie).  DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson get top billing but everyone in this movie is wonderful.  It's great watching Nicholson get crazy and play his character a little over the top.  My personal favorite is Alec Baldwin in a small scene during which he's running a stake-out.  And speaking of DiCaprio, I'm not much of a fan of him, but under Scorsese's direction, I saw his character and not the actor.  The story is great, especially since it's set in a more modern time frame rather then back in the mobs heyday (like Goodfellas and Casino).  I could rant and rave for another fifty lines, but I wouldn't do the film justice just by speaking about it.  Scorsese and the film deserved the Oscars they won.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|There's no doubt about the care that's gone into this odd but intriguing remix of classic Beatles tracks by George & Giles Martin. And, of course, stripped of the Cirque du Soleil's apparently stunning performance for which it provides the critical backdrop, reviewing it as stand alone music is a bit unfair... but here we are... so, is it worth the money?    Well, first time through it'll probably leave you bemused. So many of the tracks are so etched into our brains that cutting and mixing them together in this way is jarring, occasionally bizarre and, in places, reminiscent of Jive Bunny. But, wait a minute... isn't that mix of \\"Help\\" much clearer than you remember... isn't that combination of the backbeat from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" over \\"Within You Without You\\" just so powerful... hasn't that \\"out-take\\" version of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" made the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end... and, doesn't the adding of strings to George Harrison's already stunningly beautiful acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" make it even better? Time for another listen...     Sure, some of what's in here only works in the context of a show that you can't see but there's more than enough on offer - more vibrant productions of several classic tracks, fascinating combinations of others and several brilliant, near \\"total\\" remakes that only George Martin could dare attempt - to make it work as a \\"music only\\" experience. And, once you get past analysing the remixes and sequencings you'll end up starting to play it for what it is... a beautifully produced, clever and at times genuinely exciting celebration of some quite exceptional music.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Akira was my first anime movie and I've been hooked ever since; I'm always on the look out for good anime flicks.  The version I saw was on VHS, with the original dialog. Had it on tape for a long time, but with the rise of dvd, I went and replaced all my VHS tapes with dvd's, including Akira.  To say that I was disappointed watching it for the first time on dvd and hearing all the new english dialog is an understatement.  All my favorite lines were gone.  Yeah, the new lines kind of help flesh out the story more but man, it just wasn't the same movie I remember.  As far as the story goes, I can see where people get confused with it, but that's what makes the movie interesting to me, trying to figure out whats going on.  It's really not that convaluted as some people would like you to believe.   The government has been doing experiements on people who have superhuman powers.  One of these people, Akira, either by his own choice or through the governments experimenting, turned himself into pure energy and destroyed Tokyo in the process, as seen in the beginning of the film.  Fast forward some years and we see that Neo-Tokyo has arisen from the ashes of the once great city.  The city is in turmoil though, lawlessness is everywhere.  Biker gangs seem to rule the streets, which the main characters are all a part of one.  The government, fighting rebels and amongst itself it seems, is still conducting experiments (specifically the Army), now trying to find someone with the same potential as Akira, in the hopes of controlling this person and harnessing their power.  Enter Tetsuo, who comes into contact with one of the test subjects as they are trying to escape.  The government seizes Tetsuo and is soon doing tests on him.  The tests release Tetsuo's inner abilities (that he must have been born with) but as the powers grow, he slowly loses his sanity and decides to fight back, against everyone.  Eventually, he begins to lose control of the power within him and what followstowards the end of the movie is some of the most amazing and startling scenes ever produced. I don't want to give away any more details about the movie, but its great.  Some say Akira is old, that it's not the classic many consider it, but Akira paved the way, in my opinion, for the anime film in America.  Lots of great animes have come out since Akira, a few that could and can rival Akira in greatness; but none have that epic feel of size and scope like Akira. The animation itself is just as great if not better then ever.  The visuals are still stunning.  Overall though, the special edition is a huge disappointment.  I give it four stars because the movie to me is great, but this new version with the new dialog, as a fan of the original, it's a let down.  I've only watched it twice since buying it, its hard to sit through.  Unless it gets re-released with the original dialog here in the states, I may have to wait a long while before I pop it in, so as to not compare it to the original.  Of course, for anyone that hasn't seen it, the dialog change really shouldn't affect you at all and I hope you will come to love the movie like I do.
B00005JPG1|5.0|Any time a three hour film holds my attention,somebody did something right!!!ZODIAC never lets up.It is so chock-full of info and police leads and dead ends that the viewer is actually actively examing ALL of the evidence attempting to make an arrest!

1582701709|4.0|I read this book, but found some points that I did not agree with. We each have different opinions, so that is natural. However, the book did help me to recall what I had been missing at some level, and so deserves some praise. I do believe that there are other books to read along with this one, that can be complimentary. Islands of the Soul, by Victoria Tunnermann, as well as Deepak Chopra's latest books. One does not take anything away from the other, but instead they each offer their own version of empowerment, insight, and sense of peace and truth.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, its a comedy, darker, but not a complete tragedy.  Will Ferrell plays Harold, an IRS agent that wakes up one morning with someone narrating his life. Is he schizophrenic, no, but in a few uttered lines, he realizes that he is part of the story, a novel that was leading to his death.  A psychiatrist suggested off the cuff he go talk to someone who knew liturature, he sought out the help of a university professor, Jules Hilbert (dustin Hoffman) who set about a plan to help Harold figure out if he is part of a comedy or tragedy.  Well, the story takes off from there, and watch Harold go through many changes, and arrive at an ending that is of course \\"scripted\\"...or is it?   I thought this was a very original film and script, and well acted with perfect casting.  This I can say is one of my favorite movies of last year.  Check this one out, its a suprise.
B000001EUP|5.0|With their 1982 release, Blackout, Scorpions finally broke through the U.S. market. Their previous two albums, Lovedrive and Animal Magnetism respectively, showed the band adapting a more commercial sound without abandoning their metal roots. Those albums would also introduce longtime lead guitarist Matthias Jabs to the band, whose melodic style was a sharp contrast to the wild kamikaze playing of their previous lead guitarist, the excellent Uli Jon Roth. Rather than be a band that seemed to be going in two different directions, Scorpions were now a more focused band and this would come to fruition on Blackout. \\"No One Like You\\" would become their first U.S. hit single and would become one of their most enduring songs. Like their future hit \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\", the track contains a soft spoken verse that builds in momentum before hitting its loud and memorable chorus. Whether it's heavy songs carried by wicked riffs such as \\"Dynamite\\" and the title track, an anthem like \\"Can't Live Without You\\", or catchy melodic songs like \\"You Give Me All I Need\\" or \\"Arizona\\", the band pull it off extremely well. Not to be outdone is \\"When the Smoke is Going Down\\", another in a long line of great power ballads that the band has done well since their beginnings. Other great tracks include the short and intense \\"Now!\\" and the dramatic \\"China White.\\" All told, this is one of the great melodic metal albums of the `80s. And their next album, Love at First Sting, would be even better. Highly recommended.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Babel: A Long Strange Trip.<br /><br />Film number 3 out of 5 of this years Best Picture nominess is \\"Babel.\\"<br /><br />There's an odd theme occuring in films of late.  The plot (or plots is more like it) of many movies have been revolving around coincidence.  Babel is one such film.<br /><br />The overall plot revolves around a single rifle. Said rifle is first owned by a Japanese hunter with a deaf-mute daughter.  The hunter uses the rifle on a trip, then gives it to a Morrocian who was his guide.  Since then, he has lost his wife, and he has emotionally lost his daughter.<br /><br />The Morrocian (sp??) has sold the rifle to a local farmer in exchange for half the asking price and a free goat. The farmer lets his two boys keep the rifle while they shepherd the rest of his goats, so they can protect the herd from jackals.<br /><br />The boys argue about the usefulness of the rifle and how worthwhile a shot it is.  The younger of the two is the better shot.  He proves it by making a tourist bus his target for practice.<br /><br />Little does he know, the bus is carrying Brad Pitt and his wife, played by Cate Blanchett.  They're in Morrocco to \\"get away\\" as Pitt puts it.  The two have some marital and person issues they're both dealing with.  These issues are never brought to the forefront.  So, the audience can only assume it's a subject whose discussion could very well make their marriage crumble.<br /><br />Pitt and Blanchett have two kids left at home.  They are being looked after by a Mexican caretaker named Amelia.  Amelia receives an urgent call stating she must come to Mexico to see her son married.  On the way back, she's stopped by the border patrol.  She's placed under arrest simply because she's an alien who has been working in America for 16 years.<br /><br />Basically, the other theme of Babel is wrong choices, and the consequences because of them.  Should Amelia had left for Mexico?  She put the kids in danger, and then got caught herself.  Should Pitt and Blanchett have gone to Morrocco?  As they learned, the hard way, Morrocco doesn't exactly have the best medical system.  Everything is miles away from everything else.  If they wanted to be alone, they could have gone to an island in the Bahamas.  Should the Japanese hunter have made a better effort to make closure with his daughter? to communicate with her even if she can't speak?  Should the farmer had trusted his two young sons to use the gun properly?<br /><br />Overall, my feeling on the movie is one of overwhelming exhaustion.  Watching the 2.5 hours slip past my eyes is tiring.  It's not just because I feel as if I'm a world traveller now going from Morrocco to Japan to Mexico.  But also because of all the subtitles I had to read.<br /><br />Each of the stories involved in Babel are fascinating, if not emotionally draining.  Life is either slipping away, or has already slipped away from each character in the film.  Each of the stories would have made an excellent film on their own.<br /><br />The tragedy of the life and choices the Japanese girl makes and her final acceptance of finding a way to accept her father for who he is, and vice versa.<br /><br />The story of the Amelia and how she came to America for a better life, traveling to her home country to witness the marriage of her son.  Watching him make a life for himself, while she works hard so far away from him.<br /><br />Whatever the trouble in Brad and Cate's character's marriage is would be a great story to explore, especially given what traged befalls them on a getaway trip.<br /><br />Also, it would be a good story filled with agony and grief about the poor farmer and his sons.<br /><br />My feeling is this: Crash, best picture winner of 2005 did the coincidence story better.self.

B00005JPKC|5.0|Definitely a great and historic war film. It offers Iwo Jima, one of the last great battles of World War II's Pacific Theatre. Ken Watanabe portrays General Tadami Kuribayashi, the defender of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi battles impossible odds as most of the Japanese fleet has been destroyed and what was left of the army and naval airforces has been transferred to defend the Japanese mainland. Its only a matter of time before Japan loses the war. Letters from Iwo Jima offers this great battle from the Japanese perspective. As usual a superb performance by Ken Watanabe and an excellent film production by Hollywood great Clint Eastwood. A must buy for all war films fans.
1594200823|1.0|I loved \\"The Botany of Desire,\\" and I'm sympathetic to the basic ideas in this book. But then I got to the sixth page of the first chapter (p. 20).     Pollan makes a key statement: \\"Carbon is the most common element in our bodies--indeed in all living things.\\" Hmmm, that sounds wrong. Yup, I double checked: oxygen is 85% [correction: 65%], carbon is 18%, hydrogen is 10% etc. [EDIT: this was corrected in a later edition of the book.]    OK. Now I think I'd better read more carefully.    I get to page 46: \\"...there's a lot less energy in a bushel of corn (measured in calories) than there is in the half gallon or so of oil required to produce it.\\" Hmmm, I've heard arguments like that before, but a bushel sure is big and a half gallon is pretty small. There could be a half gallon of corn oil alone in that bushel.    So I looked up the numbers. I double checked. I found figures of 80000 to 139000 calories for the bushel of corn, and 15000 to 20000 calories for the half gallon of oil. Not even close.    These are not unimportant parts of the arguments in the book. These are the kinds of \\"facts\\" that get repeated over and over by people that believe what they read.    I find it impossible to take the rest of the book seriously.

055358202X|3.0|I guess it's a little bit silly to declare in a review of Book 4A that I'm a big fan of the Song of Ice and Fire.  After all, why else would one have waded through 3,000+ pages?<br /><br />In fact, I felt Book 3 was perhaps the best installment to date.  Perhaps it was for this reason that I was so bitterly disappointed with A Feast For Crows.  Having read many of the other reviews, I can only repeat what many others have already cited as its most glaring deficiencies.<br /><br />Most obvious, how can an author pen 1,000 pages of prose that fail to advance the already 3,000 page storyline even a little bit (with the possible exception of the Iron born).  Two of the most intriguing threads, Tyrion and Daenerys, do not even make an appearance.  It is only at the conclusion of the book that this is explained and very poorly so.<br /><br />\\"The more I thought about that, however, the more I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told ALL THE STORY FOR HALF THE CHARACTERS, RATHER THAN HALF THE STORY FOR ALL THE CHARACTERS\\".  Martin<br /><br />ALL THE STORY?  Did anyone else get all the story?  Instead, he arbitrarily ends the story for these characters no further along than when he started.  And we must wait for another partial installment featuring the characters of most interest.  And what choice do we have?  We've already invested in over 4,000 pages of reading.<br /><br />Even more troubling is that Book 4B will not even address the numerous cliffhangers left from Book 4A, most specifically Arya and Brienne.  Book 5 will not likely be published until after 2010.  How many will remember the background for these characters at that time (or will Martin spend 250 pages bringing us back up to speed).<br /><br />I can distinctly recall thinking that with writing as good as Martin's, storyline resolution was not even necessary.  Book 4A has proven me wrong.  Excellent writing that leads nowhere soon becomes frustrating.  Martin has disrespected his readers with this obvious cash grab.  But again, I feel trapped after putting in the effort to read the first four installments.ted his readers with this obvious cash grab.

B0009YKWAK|4.0|The premise in this tightly wrought thriller directed by the very accomplished Sydney Pollack is that Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the old dictator (once \\"freedom fighter\\") of an African nation called \\"Matobo\\" is coming to New York to make a speech in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter at the UN, overhears part of a conversation after-hours that leads her to believe that there will be an assassination attempt on the leader's life.  She tells security.  Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is called in to investigate and help prevent an assassination.<br /><br />Keller quickly discovers that Silvia is from Matobo where her parents were murdered by some of Zuwanie's henchmen and where she was subsequently involved in some political/paramilitary activities.  Two questions that Keller must answer are, does she have some sort of motive to lie and how is she involved?<br /><br />The problem with the film (aside from some of the usual improbabilities and contortions found in Hollywood thrillers--and to be honest there weren't that many in this one) is the ending.  Without giving anything away, the probability of Zumanie being left alone after what had happened is something like zero.  But the real problem is what happens between Tobin and Silvia at the end.  They are both very available and after they have had the opportunity to bond under very difficult circumstances, can you guess how their relationship is resolved?  I understand there was an alternative ending.  Maybe Pollack should have employed it.<br /><br />Pollack's films going back several decades are characterized by diversity of subject matter, excellent scripts, and star power.  Four of his best are They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969) (depression ear dance marathon drama starring Jane Fonda); Tootsie (1982) (romantic comedy starring Dustin Hoffman); Out of Africa (1985) (adapted from the famous book by Karen Blixen under her pen name \\"Isak Dinesen,\\" starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford); and Sabrina (1995) (splendid remake of the Audrey Hepburn film this time starring Julie Ormond and Harrison Ford).  But he tends to like action/adventure as much as comedy or drama.  He is one of filmdom's most versatile directors, and this film, while not his best, is very representative of his work.<br /><br />But what carries the film is the charisma of the stars, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, especially Kidman who seems the very impersonation of what an interpreter at the UN might be.  She manages to be delicate but tough, thoroughly professional and beautiful.  I have seen her in seven or eight films and can say that she is as talented as any actress currently working.  In her ability to concentrate and to completely immerse herself in a role she is comparable to Meryl Streep.  Some early films of hers that display her youthful vitality and the natural sophistication and nuanced manner of her style are Dead Calm (1989), Flirting (1991), and To Die For (1995).<br /><br />By the way, \\"Matobo\\" is not an actual nation but is the name of a national park in Zimbabwe and as far as I can tell \\"Ku\\" is not an actual language.

B0000640VO|5.0|AMELIE is an enchanting film that Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates with artistic mastery.  The film depicts a young woman who grapples with her past but confronts her guileless shyness, and shows the psychological intricacies in her life where she intermingles those complexities with unpretentious encounters with others.  Amelie is almost like Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou plays Amelie, a woman who suffered traumatic experiences during her childhood with the death of her mother, the loss of her goldfish, and a father who keeps a sanctuary for his wife and has a fetish for ceramic gnome figures.  Then suddenly, after watching news reports about Princess Diana's death, and by accident, finding a little cubbyhole in her bathroom, which has hidden a box of someone's childhood treasures, she believes it is an epiphany to do virtuous deeds and to find the rightful owner of the box.<br /><br />Jeunet shows a montage of humorous quick cuts and quirky facial expressions.  The film is lively and fast-paced with a tinge of subtle moments.  An interesting part of the film shows Amelie and her neighbor, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), though during individual occasions, watching TV and flipping from one channel to the next where in several instances they view unusual vintage clips, such as a black woman playing an electric guitar with a gospel choir in the background and a man dancing a jig with his wooden leg on what looks like a southern dirt road as well as reflections of their own lives; the images are somewhat surreal and dream-like, but may possibly speak towards a type of inventiveness on the part of the participants in the scenes.<br /><br />The film is enticing with an array of fascinating colors and images that should be contributed to the impeccable cinematography and artwork.  Indeed, it has a Salvador Dali-quality, and also captures a picturesque French landscape, which looks like a framed portrait.  The animated portion of the film is charming.  In addition, the musical score contains various moods from a music box to a pumping accordion, which evokes the French ambience that weaves in an out of the film.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD is an interesting package, which includes bonus and background material about the film.  Viewers have the chance to understand the story behind the making of the film with several interviews of Jeunet and the actors and discussion of the storyboard.  In addition, there are screen tests of Audrey Tautou, Urban Cancelier (Collignon--The Grocer), and Yolanda Moreu (Madeleine Wallace--Concierge) and the film's trailer.<br /><br />If you are looking for a unique and unpredictable film, I recommend AMELIE.  It will make you smile.contains various moods from a music box to a pumping accordion, which evokes the French ambience that weaves in an out of the film.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|The only good thing that I can say about this movie is that it finally ended. This DVD will go in my spring garage sale.  If it sells for .25 cents, I will be satisfied.  I have to be extremely moved, for better or worse, by a movie before I will take time to rate one, whether the movie is good or bad.  All sarcasism aside, this is the second worst movie to ever come out of Hollywood.  My objective reasons are: 1) The plot is disjointed through all but the final scenes, and even then one is left to wonder what the h*** happened to the Morrocan family.  2) The Japanese family that was featured left a lot to be desired, so far as supplying a logical progressive story line with a logical conclusion.  That, of course could be said to some extent about all four nationalities portrayed in each of their four loosely connected stories, that were POORLY interwoven. 3) The \\"token\\" sex scenes depicting a 12 year-old boy masturbating and who is also a window peeper watching his naked sister, and the teenage Japanese girl who tries to have sex with every man she admires, is overdone and detracts from the central plot, if there is one. 4) There seems to be a suble anti-gun theme woven through the movie, which might move neutral thinkers on the \\"Right to Bear Arms\\" issue, to move to the left. I would have rated this movie Zero, if that had been a choice. <br />BTW, the worst movie I ever saw was, \\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They.\\"  I have traveled the world and visited and fought in Third-World countries, so I must say that the Morocco and Mexico scenes were somewhat believable.  I served in the US Army to fight for the rights of movie makers to make a piece trash like \\"Babel.\\"  I will sell my copy of Babel for a fourth of what it's currently going for, unless I have to wait until spring.  Plus S/H. of course.   <br />Larry - Vietnam Veteran <br />
B000IZJZLM|3.0|Imagine if the Backstreet Boys had actual singing talent and looked more like men than boys, they would probably look and sound like Il Divo. Yes Il Divo's music is ripe for parody given how cheesy it is with their overdramatized vocals and cheesy pop lyrics but I have to admit these guys can sing. I wasn't going to buy another Il Divo cd but when I saw a used copy of \\"Siempre\\" at my favorite cd store. I decided what the heck. I have to admit that I enjoy \\"Ancora\\" a lot so I thought I'd check out their more recent offering \\"Siempre\\". I must say that this cd did absolutely nothing for me. Half of the songs were bland and boring. I felt like I was listening to Josh Groban all over again on \\"Caruso\\" and that is not a good thing because the men do not offer anything different to this song that I haven't heard before. I did like the group's cover of The Moody Blues' \\"Nights in White Satin (Notte Di Luce)\\" and \\"Una Noche\\" but otherwise there is nothing spectacular about this cd that hasn't been done before by Josh Groban. Ya know it would be nice if the men were more subtle when it comes to singing like they were on this track than the loud, bombastic, foghorns they have a tendency to sound on most of the album. Gee another Mariah Carey cover? If \\"Heroe\\" wasn't cheesetastic enough, \\"Without You\\" will send your insulin levels to straight to the moon. I really wish Il Divo would find songs that were so insipidly drippy like \\"Without You\\" and \\"Heroe\\". Better yet I wish they would write their own material for once. I saw Simon Cowell on 60 Minutes this past weekend, it was obvious that he created this group just to make money. This band is nothing more than a manufactured boy pop group that just happens to sing opera music.
B000NIVJEU|4.0|I have not read the book but will now that I know at least a few people say the book is better. But as for a fantasy film with good visuals and a nice story line I thought this film was pretty good.
B000002JSP|4.0|Oh,man...the girl's loved this album as background music for...well, you know what I mean! This album was a definite departure from any previous release,but I like the extra input from John Paul Jones.(actually,a LOT of extra input). This not a massively guitar driven CD. Production is great. My memories from having a good time with friends while listening to this are very fond. I'll always own a copy,and recommend this to most anyone that loves Zep.
B00005JP97|4.0|This movie is decidedly odd.  And that is a compliment. <br /> <br />Steeped in 70s grindhouse theatrics, pulp novel characters, deep south blues, and southern fried musings, \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is to cinema what its firey blues is to music:  a rebellious and raucous over-the-top examination of relationship drama and personal demons. <br /> <br />Emphasis on the raucous and over-the-top. <br /> <br />Many will refer to this as the movie where Samuel L. Jackson chains a half-naked Christina Ricci to a radiator; and although any movie that includes such a scene is probably asking for it, it would be all too short-sighted of anyone to limit an explanation of this film to its more shocking elements. <br /> <br />Writer/director Craig Brewer, of \\"Hustle and Flow\\" fame, is clearly going for 'memorable' with many of the films stuntier moments, but he clearly has more to say about self-control, free will, human kindness and redemption beneath the surface.   <br /> <br />Those who love bizarre and audacious films to begin with are sure to find plenty here to revel in, but if you are on the fence, as long as you are a movie goer who can handle something a little odd, a little twisted and a little out of the ordinary, I think you will find \\"Black Snake Moan\\" to be a heartfelt, truly original experience that manages to be a rare morality tale that avoids clichés, sentimentality and easy answers.  It is highlighted by two terrific lead performances by Jackson and Ricci as full-blooded, fully realized characters, rather than the caricatures we get in standard, dumbed-down romantic comedy schlock that pander to cuteness over reality to audiences.  A drop-dead awesome blues soundtrack surely helps. <br /> <br />The film will clearly not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you can appreciate something a little out of the ordinary there is plenty here to savor. <br /> <br />\\"Black Snake Moan\\" is the kind of film that reminds us just how exciting and unique movies can be when filmmakersare allowed to run with their unique, creative vision.  They may not always speak to the masses, but they damn sure make for an exciting two hour journey.  <br />
B000089RV6|5.0|This album was dropped like a gazillion-ton rock and roll meteor onto the world in 1980.This album changed the ear of the new decade,and set the bar so high,it has yet to be me met again. While cited for being over the top sexist, every rocker girl I knew understood it was just saying out loud everything that was being said and done while the chase was being plotted. All part of the game,and this was perfect background music for the whole ritual. Yes,it's about booze,dr#gs and women.  <br />Regarding this remastering job, it's one of the best I have ever heard. Sounds like this is being played live,instead of being a studio effort,and I mean this as an absolute compliment. We KNOW how much studio time and effort went into this album,but for this to NOW sound like a perfect live recording?! WOW! <br />If you own any version other that this, throw it away and re-up today. <br />
B000NMW6M0|1.0|This movie is so disjointed that you watch it hoping to understand what's going on.  Brad Pitt, who I think is great, walked through his role, what there was of it.  Kate Blanchard was the heroin that you couldn't like.  Everyone else in the movie did what you would expect them to do, no orginality.  I flat cannot recommend this movie to anyone, Academy awards aside.

0783229372|3.0|No film that Pauline Kael despised on principle (in this case the principle that it was directed by Robert Wise) can be all bad, and so it proves with The Hindenburg, which falls somewhere between a countdown-to-catastrophe period political thriller a la Tora! Tora! Tora!, 70s conspiracy movie and by-the-numbers disaster movie. It's as a disaster movie that it fails the most: the destruction of the Hindenburg was simply too quick to make for much of a climax, and playing the famous black and white newsreel footage intercut with unimpressive cutaways to the less than stellar cast at the end feels like a real cheat, especially since it's often clumsily handled. On the plus side it offers a clever screen story from legendary Monday Mystery Movie TV scribes William Levinson and Richard Link that sees George C. Scott's reluctant Luftwaffe Colonel sent by Goebbels on the airship's last voyage to uncover a plot to destroy the ship and thus embarrass the Nazi regime that uses it for their own propaganda. While the real investigations in Germany and America give the film some momentum, unfortunately the search for suspects among this particular sedately paced Airship of Fools is less than urgent: indeed, it's pretty obvious who is behind the plot and how Scott will react when he uncovers him.     That the supporting cast is more solid than glittering doesn't help: Anne Bancroft's aristocratic old flame has little to do but bemoan the way the Nazis have taken over her estate, cheat at cards and smoke the kind of cigarettes you don't get over the counter, but still manages to make more of her part than the script does; Roy Thinnes does well as the Gestapo man hitting on a young Jewish passenger because \\"I'm anxious to try one before they run out\\"; Richard Dysart does the good German wondering what's happening to his country routine as one of the owners (who historically was more than happy to cosy up to the Nazis if it was good for business); Charles Durning keeps the glowering to a minimum as the pro-Nazi captain; Gig Young is clearly drunk in a couple of scenes (yes, I know he's playing a drunk, but he slurs even when he's supposed to be sober half the time); while star-that-never-was William Atherton lurks in the rigging moodily before saving the ship from the danger that his own incompetence puts it in the first place. Shame they couldn't have afforded a couple of British actors for Burgess Meredith and Rene Auberjonois' parts. However, it does boast one of Scott's more natural and likeably underplayed performances before his penchant for drunken Long John Silver impersonations took over, managing to keep it all together until things go bang. The production design is excellent, Albert Whitlock's special effects, while dated, are often impressive and there's a lovely score by David Shire that's recently been released as an extremely limited edition CD. And it's hard to write off a film entirely that has one nervous passenger suggest \\"Next time, let's take the Titanic.\\"     Sadly, Universal's DVD is an appalling transfer: it may be in the original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but it looks like a public domain videocassette, with ghosting, edge enhancement problems and serious problems dealing with the airship's struts. It's watchable, but added to the lack of extras (aside from some production notes), it makes this one a reluctant purchase for the film's more ardent fans only until it gets remastered. Alternately, you might seek out Anchor Bay's UK Region 2 PAL DVD, which boasts a much better 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with a fine stereo soundtrack (though no extras).

B000LC3ID8|5.0|If you are  a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie because it answers a lot of things about the first movie. It gives Amanda a lot of backstory, including how and why she really became an apprentice of Jigsaw. There are a lot of scenes that will make you squirm in the film, worse things than what they have shown in the previous two films. The written is still engaging and it is easy to be sucked into the story as you watch every twisted thing that is done to the victims. After the movie ended, I got the feeling that Jigsaw wasn't so bad and I was able to understand why he does what he does. There is almost an empathy to Jigsaw when it shows more of his past as well. Overall, this is a movie that should end the trilogy and not have a fourth movie. I hear rumors of a fourth movie in the works, but the perfect ending is with this movie
B000059MEK|4.0|In a word, unforgettable. In a sentence, profound electronica with strong beats and fine melody.     In a paragraph...    Daft Punk is special. They're a synth-rock (A.K.A. \\"electronica\\") band that takes a little noise for a long ride. They do so much with so little, an oft-forgotten necessity of music production. With an ear for attention-getting tone and a razor-sharp sense of rhythm, an artist can whisk you to the moon and back while keeping you on your feet, stomping out the explosive beats. It's easy to see - or rather, hear - that the Daft Punk duo possesses this profound ability. Powerful two-chord progressions and a bridge are pretty common here. Raging, well-engineered rhythms (Aerodynamic; Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger; Crescendolls; Short Circuit) mix delicately with well-groomed romanticist fare (Digital Love; Something About Us; Veridis Quo; Face To Face) with a fine selection of kickin' noise in between.    And don't forget to check out Interstella 5555, the zero-dialog 60-minute \\"Japanimation\\" music video crafted around this album.
0765348276|5.0|I'd read Instapundit's remarks on John Scalzi's novel and so decided to give it a try. Years since I read science fiction. The book lives up to its billing, although I wonder about the apparent put-down of the space elevator as impossible without advanced technology, which was unexplained, other than to say it was even beyond the already understood need for improvements in materials for the cables... Anyhow, that's a quibble when the rest of the book is pretty enthralling, the ideas believable, and the love story at its heart quite compelling.
0451196716|5.0|Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman turns out a superb story that is set in the world that is passionate about an event that involves a game.  The game is a lottery in which certain boys are chosen for the walk.  The problem with this walk is that it is not a game where the loser goes home.  They simply walk till...<br /><br />I will not give it away, I just want to say that it is a compelling read that I could not put down, and years later picked up again to read again.  The communistic feel of the soldiers and law presents more feelings of Hopelessness in the days that lie before the boys on this road.  From the beginning when his mother to the bizarre ending, and all the towns and people in between drops off the boy, it is story that has impact for sure.  Follow them...into oblivion.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|While it is certainly different then their first album, it is still some of the very best indie pop/rock to come out in recent years. Relying more on darker sounds and imagery, this album rewards repeat listens.  It flows with gorgeous song structures and luscious arrangement, and is all centered by a magnificent pipe organ. <br />If you appreciate good music, do yourself a favor and buy this.
B00005JPCF|5.0|This movie made me, yes, happy. I didn't see anything else last year that was filled with this much sheer joy, including \\"Happy Feet\\"'s Oscar competition, \\"Cars.\\"  <br /> <br />Conservatives continue to complain about the film's \\"left-wing\\" message, oblivious to the irony of assigning a globally-aware attitude to the opposing team. Yes, \\"Happy Feet\\" has a strong eco-message. Is it a bad thing to teach kids, in an entertaining way, that destroying their planet is something they shouldn't do?  <br /> <br />It's sad that anyone would define \\"Happy Feet\\"'s \\"messages\\" -- that we should celebrate talented individuals and take care of our environment -- as negatives. Are those making derisive comments really against those things? That doesn't make them look superior or knowledgeable. It makes them look small-minded and uninformed, and that's nothing to brag about. <br /> <br />But, fine, forget saving the planet. Look instead at the film's other message, that being unique is something to be celebrated, not scorned. And if you're allergic to messages in any form, just gaze at director George Miller's amazing CGI landscapes and beautifully-rendered characters, and listen to the superb voicework by Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and -- dang, who knew Brittany Murphy could sing like that? \\"Happy Feet\\" celebrates diversity and global togetherness and... okay, that's a fantasy. But it's presented in a way that makes you believe, for just a little while, it could actually happen. And that massive tap dancing penguin finale rocks.
B0006GAI82|4.0|After the huge and growing success of the first two \\"Die Hard\\" movies, the world clamored for a third.  But how do you keep it fresh?  This story is not on Christmas, moves us to McClane's home turf in New York, splits him off from Holly (she is still in California and they haven't spoken for a year), and instead of the pleasant African-American cop Sgt Powell, we get Samuel L. Jackson as a proud and a tad angry African-American named Zeus Carver (which leads to an early misunderstanding, \\"Hey, Zeus\\" sounding like the Spanish pronunciation of Jesus, right?).<br /><br />During the opening shot establishing that we are in New York, the title sequence ends in a rather stunning way and we are off to the races.  However, in this movie McClane doesn't impose himself into the situation, he is dragged in by the villain, who calls himself Simon and who seems to have a some kind of personal grudge against him.<br /><br />The way Zeus is pulled into this mess is also quite interesting and I have to say that Samuel L. Jackson adds as much to the movie and keeping it fresh as I am sure the writers and the producers hoped.  He is terrific and makes a great foil and partner for Willis' McClane.<br /><br />We expect explosions and impossible stunts in the \\"Die Hard\\" movies and get them aplenty here.  They found ways to stick them in (and don't) where we don't often expect them.  Jeremy Irons is fine as Simon.  His army seems to be composed of people who believe in the story he tells about why he is doing this, but some seem to be there as mercenaries without any belief.  It is quite a fascinating weave of textures in character.<br /><br />Pay attention to even the little details in the beginning because they come back.  Nothing is in there for idle chat even if it seems like idle chat.<br /><br />The production budge of this movie was even bigger than the first two, but the U.S. gross was down a bit from Die Hard 2, however, the gross overseas was about has big as the total gross fro the second film.  It was huge.<br /><br />I will say that there is an awful lot of swearing and f-words in this movie that I found grinding after awhile.  Really, writers, you can use other words.  We do not need a curse every other word to know that these guys are under stress.  Graham Greene's does a great job and his character is under just as much stress and you found a way that he didn't swear (I don't believe).

B000LC55F2|5.0|At the beginning of the movie we learn that magicians view their tricks as three act plays, The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.  This movie is also presented in this way.  We learn about two young apprentice magicians who are friends.  Both live in poor circumstances, but they have very different characters.  Christian Bale plays Alfred Bordon, who is the more talented of the two, but is hurt as a magician because of his misanthropic personality.  He is less charismatic and less able to connect with the audience than the more flamboyant Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />The story is not told lienearly and doesn't explain much about when we are jumping forward and backwards.  It more or less unfolds in its own way and you pick up bits and pieces and try to add them to what you have been told.  The point being is that you are never sure if you have stuck this new bit of info in the right place or are even seeing it the right way.<br /><br />Something goes horribly wrong during one dangerous trick and this sets off a more than bitter rivalry between the two men.  Of course, as things escalate between the two there are bystanders taken into the vortex of their attempts at mutual professional (and physical) destruction.<br /><br />David Bowie does a very interesting turn as Nikola Tesla, who really did live in Colorado Springs at the time the movie is set, and did have a huge magnifying transmitter in his laboratory that is also shown in the movie.  A powerful visual image.  How he becomes involved in the lives of the protagonists, I will leave to the movie to explain to you.<br /><br />Even if you think you have figured out the main punch line of the movie, the actual Prestige of the final act is not likely be what you think it is.  In fact, it has multiple layers.<br /><br />Enjoy it.  Fine performances are given throughout, especially by the women drawn into their lives to their eventual sorrow.  They are Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson.  And of course, Michael Caine is the anchor of the whole thing and plays his role with perfection.<br /><br />I recommend it very much.Scarlett Johansson.

0896760839|5.0|Janet Arnold's books have been well used by me over the years.  I have made several costumes from each of her books and thrilled with each result.  The documentation and drawings are excellent.  However, these books are not for beginners.  All of the drawings are shown reduced on grid that will have to be re-sized for each wearer which can be very time consuming depending on the complexity of the design.  The patterns are historically accurate and portray how the costumes were cut out and constructed in their day.  <br />I wish I could find undergarment patterns this detailed.

I can not listen to this album the whole way through; the songs with vocals make me cringe and skip to the next tracks. \\"Alone in Kyoto,\\" \\"Alpha Beta Gaga,\\" and \\"Mike Mills\\" are brilliant songs, but the rest of the album is ruined by cheesy lyrics, poorly sung, and distorted not to add any ethereal quality but to mask the limited vocal ability of the duo.
B000HCO840|3.0|My real complaint about the collector's edition is how far it is from being a collector's edition. First it came with one (1) dvd. Only one, that had the movie, the usual optional audio commentaries, the usual deleted scenes and alternate endings. Let me tell you something the deleted scenes were a joke they weren't even completely deleted scenes. The only difference in a few were maybe a character changed a facial expression, or said one word differently, or in one case where they attempted some comedy and magneto had beard in a scene that they showed twice. IT WAS LIKE WOW, JUST WHAT I WANTED. Puh-lease. We want to see scenes that could have affected the storyline, that actually had SUBSTANCE. The alternate endings were just as pathetic. Really, Seriously, they call this a collector's edition???<br /><br />I loved the first two X-men movies and this one was even better. I do agree with most of the reviews that they've not developed storylines that they've alluded to in the beginning, in particular Rogue, Iceman and Kitty, I'm kind of glad they didn't bother to go there, and make it some love triangle pack of stupidity. But I do agree Cyclops was just killed off and that was the end of it. I do however, disagree, Storm's grief when Professor X died was deep.<br /><br />Bottom line is buy the normal widescreen bit, because the only thing you're paying an additional 9.00 for is the never before released comic book. I haven't read it yet due to pure disappointment that they didn't even have interviews with the cast, or an interactive segment with the villains and heroes, describing the new ones, or even giving a update on the old ones that we knew.<br /><br />Come on, in the year 2007 we're seriously receiving a collector's edition with only ONE DVD!?!?! With no extra features to speak of???
B00005JPAD|3.0|This does tell some plot secrets, but gently. Has spoilers. <br /> <br />I cop to its deep professionalism. Truth told, I went mostly to see Martin Sheen, deserved star of THE WEST WING, reduced to a minor role, and prove himself by far the best actor in the film. To see him and Jack Nicholson in one short scene together was a treat. Thing is, Nicholson it seemed to me, an actor I respect, was playing his character as if he were The Joker, sans joke, a humorless Joker. <br /> <br />It was a good story and Vera Farmiga was a plus. <br /> <br />But I didn't care about anybody. BigNameActor/MainCharacterA got shot. Who cared. Same with B or C or D.  I never really \\"got\\" the DiCaprio character, nor why he was a best-actor nominee; good job, no more than that, not remotely on the same level as Mirren or Dench. Alec Baldwin did a good job, very good, but his character was irrelevant to the story so why was he there? <br /> <br />As a documentary it may have some value, same as THE BLACK DONNELLYS may. As an example of the art of storytelling, of mystery writing (and it really was a mystery genre pretending to be a police/crook genre, whatever that is called), it did a good job but the emotion of the drama was subsumed under the action and gunshots. Another hood gets shot? Oh well... So they almost all died, no loss to me or to society and thus the movie failed. <br /> <br />What's with Scorsese? As his skill increased his humanity fell? THE SOPRANOS does it better, with less detail perhaps, and a lot more emotional impact. I know Tony is a vicious killer, not too different from the Nicholson character. But I was happy the latter got killed and I hope Tony finds a way out, sad to say. I wonder if others could get into this movie more than I could. <br /> <br />And oh, it violtaed a principle stated clearly in the newish David Mamet book, BAMBI VS. GODZILLA, about \\"aesthetic distance\\": It's okay to show a 555 phone number in a cartoon or spoof, but not in a serious realistic drama like this. Scorsese broke Mamet's rule, and it hurt the scene. \\"Remember,\\" it implied, \\"This is just a movie not real.\\" <br /> <br />By the way, his name is pronounced SKOR-SESS-SEE, not SKOR-SAY-ZEE.
034544678X|5.0|In this wonderful book, McConnell deftly explores some of the all too common problems that arise between humans and canines because the two species have inherently different ways of communicating.  For example, while humans consider it polite to make eye contact and approach another person directly, dogs consider this hostile and confrontive.  Polite dogs approach each other from the side, and only if they play together often do they get away with making direct eye contact.  McConnell makes the case that humans misunderstanding this bit of canine-etiquette has caused many a dog-bite.  Another bit of advice she offers - if you want your dog to approach you, don't move toward her; turn and move the other way.  (It works!)  And yet another tidbit - never pat a dog on the top of his head; dogs dislke this.  (If you don't believe her, just pat your dog on the head and see for yourself the look on his face!)  \\"The Other End of the Leash\\" is jam-packed with examples of mistakes we humans make in dealing with our canine companions, and suggesions about how to communicate what we really want to communicate.   <br /> <br />Not only is this book filled with helpful suggestions about how to better communicate with dogs, it's loaded with tips about how to choose one!  I wish I'd read this BEFORE getting my puppy - I'd have been more careful about selecting a breeder.  I'd have made better use of that small window of opportunity puppies have to be properly socialized - if only I'd known about it before the window closed!  I'd have chosen my puppy more carefully - i.e., not based the decision merely on breed, gender and looks, but on the puppy's disposition and ability to tolerate frustration.   <br /> <br />\\"The Other End of the Leash\\" is so much more than a how-to book on human - canine communication.  It's a well-written, reads-like-a-novel page-turner that's filled with interesting vignettes and useful information. McConnell's love for dogs and respect for their owners shinesthrough brilliantly.  When I finished this book, I had that 'aaahhhh' feeling I get when I've read a thoroughly satisfying novel. <br /> <br />Thank you Patricia McConnell!
B0000024ZC|5.0|This fantastic 1972 album is the third GG album overall and shows the band starting to weave the dense counterpoint into their pieces that made them such a fantastic prog band and albums like Free Hand (1975) a benchmark for complexity.  In fact, this album stands in stark contrast with the comparatively spacey and more \\"rocking\\" Acquiring the Taste (1971), although bits and pieces of both properties peek through here and there.  In fact, it is this combination that makes Three Friends such a great Gentle Giant recording and shows what happened when the band started to exert more control over their music.  The concept on this album is also something I can appreciate and if I am interpreting this correctly, comments on English class structure.  This is nicely relayed through a story of three school friends that as adults become an artist, a businessman, and a laborer respectively - ultimately going from \\"class to class\\".<br /><br />The lineup at this point included Kerry Minnear (piano; mellotron; mini-moog; Hammond organ; vibraphone; percussion; and vocals); Ray Shulman (bass guitar; violin; 12-string acoustic; and vocals); Gary Green (electric and acoustic guitars); Derek Shulman (lead vocals); Malcom Mortimore (drums); and Philip Shulman (saxophones).  These guys were all incredible musicians and on Three Friends the playing really takes flight - Gentle Giant made great strides towards the quintessential Gentle Giant sound found on Octopus (1973) and The Power and the Glory (1974).<br /><br />What makes the compositions really interesting is that when combined, a number of different parts played on a range of instruments make each piece sound extremely complex.  For example, there are often several melodies going at once (on as many instruments) and Ray is a master when it comes to providing counterpoint on the bass - he is an exceptionally creative player.  Although I really appreciate the time spent on the intricate arrangements, there are some ripping electric guitar solos, which are a lot of fun too.<br /><br />Well there you have it.  Three Friends is a fantastic and early album by Gentle Giant that is very highly recommended along with Acquiring the Taste; Octopus; The Power and the Glory; Free Hand; and In'terview (1976)., which are a lot of fun too.     Well there you have it.  Three Friends is a fantastic and early album by Gentle Giant that is very highly recommended along with Acquiring the Taste; Octopus; The Power and the Glory; Free Hand; and In'terview (1976).
0792843584|5.0|I have now seen the film four times including twice on it's original run over 25 years ago and all I can say is that see it and judge for yourself - you will be pleasantly surprised.  Apart from the first 20 minute sequence which tries to create a mood of halcyon days but fails somewhat, the rest of this beautiful film (and it is stunning visually) ranks alongside many other westerns favoured and promoted by the same critics who maligned this one.  In fact, it presents a far truer picture of 'how the west was won' and shows how the social, economic and political factors mainly determined by greedy easterners were manipulated to their own ends although this is my own opinion as this elegiac western is actually ambiguous in pointing blame and much of the morality is anything but  black and white.  It does, however, clearly show how the stockholders were more than willing take advantage of their status, class and wealth to bend the law and even redefine it to achieve their objectives.  So not much has changed in the last 100 odd years then since the events of the film. <br /> <br />Kristofferson, Walken and Huppert get the most screen time, individually and in pairs, but the rest of the cast is top notch too and both Waterston and Bridges shine in their smaller roles.   <br /> <br />As I stated above the film is visually stunning thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond,  but the emphasis is firmly on the story and characterisation.   Although \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is nearly four hours long, it never feels like it and once you are immersed in the story and visuals the picture never wants for pace.  The music is not overblown but actually plays a part in setting the mood more so than being suggestive of what emotions we should be feeling and being relentless as in most modern epics.  Musical highlights include  when Ella first drives the Studebaker carriage, the picnic and later during the roller derby line dance sequence. <br /> <br />There is much to enjoy in this fine film and I can honestly say that what the establishment critics said at the time of the film's initial release is unfounded and unfair and reeks of a witch hunt.   <br /> <br />If you have a multi-region dvd player, I suggest you seek out the Region 4 version (Australia) as it is anamorphic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LC55F2|5.0|A unique movie worth watching twice.   <br />You do need to pay attention, especially in the beginning to understand what's going on. You have to watch or you'll get confused, and it's not easy. But it's extrememly entertaining, artistic, and the acting of Caine, Jackman & Bale is just exquisite. Not like any other movie you will see this year. <br />See also highly recommended: THE ASYLUM w. Natasha Richardson & Sir Ian McKellan
B00009W0WM|5.0|I'm of three minds on the subject of the greatest love story. It's either this remarkable film in which Rick (Bogart) sends Ilsa (Bergman) off for the greater cause, Gone With The Wind in which Scarlett O'Hara doesn't realize she loves Rhett until its too late, or Titanic in which Rose DeWitt Bukator carries the memory of Jack Dawson in her heart throughout a titanic lifetime. It's tough... so, I don't think I'll even try. <br /> <br />I will say that Casablanca means so much to so many people, to even write a review, I feel like I'm walking on pins and needles. The dialogue is still some of the best written ever. You've got the most timeless lines; \\"Here's lookin' at you, kid\\" or \\"Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she walks into mine\\" or \\"We'll always have Paris\\". But, visually, it's not quite as inspired, stunning or meaningful as its big-budget counterparts. Is that a good or a bad thing? Tough to say. <br /> <br />I think the three films outdo one another in certain areas. Where Casablanca fails in terms of its visuals, Gone With The Wind and Titanic succeed with flying colors. No pun intended. Where Gone With The Wind may get tiresome after the first three hours, Casablanca and Titanic succeed so much better in terms of pace. Where Titanic fails with dialogue is where Casablanca and Gone With The Wind succeed gloriously. It's a beautiful triangle of great romance, great action, and great drama if you ask me.  <br /> <br />After so many years, Casablanca still looks great. Die-hard fans should love all of the new extras in this set.  <br /> <br />For being one of the three legs in a tripod of love set against apocolyptic backdrops in which the lovers are tested, forced to separate, and ultimately give their audiences a greater view of the world... (let me catch my breath)... Casablanca may be the one leg that supports the other two best.  <br /> <br />
B000BBOUU4|1.0|I love Johnny Depp but the creepy Michael Jackson voice ruined this from minute one.  Tim Burton must have read a different book than the rest of us.  The tortured flashbacks of what made Willy Wonka spoiled what is a story about the deserving getting a break.  I would resell it but why would anyone want it.
B00006L6YG|5.0|Most people born in the last century have heard \\" The Girl from Ipanema\\". However, those uninitiated to jazz may have missed the total recording that launched the cabana classic. The sum total is better than its parts.<br /><br />Even a language barrier is not a problem. My foreign language knowledge rests with Spanish, and then there is very little fluency, so the Portugese lyrics might daunt some listeners.  However,  it floats along to a degree that I could plug some lyrical parts and still be transfixed by the melodies. All serious jazz fans should have this as a part of their collection, and any interested in exploring couldn't go wrong by giving this a try.
B000H5U65C|4.0|Has anyone else had problems with the DVD?  I've tried 2 standalone DVD players, plus my laptop, and it won't play in any of them.  Naturally, I had the disc for about a month and a half before trying the DVD.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Forget Donald Trump; Donald Fagen, with his wry voice and uncanny ability to combine farcical metaphor with jazz inflected pop melodies, is the towering \\" Donald\\". Everything Mr. Fagen touches turns to gold. The only thing preventing this CD from entering perfection range is a little camp, but that never hurt anyone, right?<br /><br />\\" Morph the Cat\\". What does that mean? Is it an imaginary blanket of protection hovering over New York, reassuring everyone after the jolt of 9/11? Does it mean that \\"protection\\" can morph into strange alter egos, created by zealots? The rest of the CD would bear this explanation out.<br /><br />After the title track, Fagen briefly turns his attention to one of his offbeat character studies in \\" H Gang\\". Great beat, sounds like Steely Dan. \\" What I Do\\" is a fantastic imagined conversation between Fagen and legendary Ray Charles, presumably held at the beginning of young Don's adulthood. \\" Brite Nightgown\\", probably the best song ever about cheating death , is amazing, save a marathon closing.<br /><br />\\" Mona\\" is another wandering spirit fabled to be depressed, to say the least. \\" Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" is a stab at the administration. They snuck in.... lock yourself away.<br /><br />This is a living legend performer who never runs out of fresh material. Shame on this year's Grammy panel for so little recognition!
B000LE0THO|3.0|I too was disapointed in the remaster.  I've read the comments on the other reviews, and there are a number of reasons why the remaster didn't seem to meet my expectations.  But the bottom line is that I bought this expecting a significant upgrade in the listening experience, and I didn't get it.<br /><br />The book is cool.  The little cut-out spaceship and the printed stuff is a fitting tribute to this pop masterpiece, but I expected more in terms of sound, and bonus tracks for that matter (although what's there is good and we've already got a double album on one CD so there's not much space left for bonus tracks).<br /><br />I suppose that if this is the best that can be done after thirty years, then as the old saying goes: that's all there is; there isn't any more.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Clapton took a beating for this CD. It was given mediocre status, at best, by critics and fans alike. Why do we want our artists to be sin eaters? Clapton happy is.... Clapton happy. Aren't we happy for him?<br /><br />Okay, fair is fair, the opening track is a little self absorbed and weak. The musicianship rocks, but the lyrics are trite. The second one isn't much better. After this, though, the CD really picks up. The songs are well crafted, the lyrics don't swerve back into limbo territory. \\"Piece of My Heart\\" is better than any \\"sway\\" love song I've heard in a while, although we are not living in romantic times. \\" Back Home\\" ,  the finishing set, does confirm that Clapton has been on quite a journey, but he's ready to put aside the weary journeyman in favor of the settled, stable soul. What's wrong with that?<br /><br />This CD is not Eric's best, but it is also not a throw-away. Open your mind and let Clapton open his heart!
B000002BFZ|4.0|\\"No Code\\" was always going to be a difficult direction change for Pearl Jam. The album cuts out the majority of their typical grunge sound, and adds a more complex and genre mix-matching style. In essence, calling it an experimental album works.<br /><br />The fact that PJ decided to branch out from their grunge tag, a sound that they so heavily shaped, seems to me a positive action. There was no need for Ten Part 2. That is not to say that this album will not satisfy die-hard fans of the genre. The band still rocks out in style with heavy hitters such as \\"Hail, Hail\\", a ferocious song showcasing a roaring vocal delivery from Vedder. \\"Habit\\" is my other favourite of the hard rocking tracks, and again sees PJ hark back to their early 90's sound, fusing catchy choruses with distorted riffing and sharp guitar soloing.<br /><br />The biggest change in direction comes in the pop sensibility of the album. The writing is often very laid-back, in a kind of melancholy and introspective way, all the time retaining a heavy pop, even glam-pop vibe. This is exemplified in tracks such as \\"In My Tree\\", which sports one of the band's most infectious vocal melodies to date, \\"Off He Goes\\" which has a very laid-back and drawn out Neil Young feel to it, and my personal favourite of the album \\"Present Tense\\", which slowly progresses a simple yet brilliantly poignant chorus. While PJ have always had a good ear for melody, the more popish songs on \\"No Code\\" see this aspect fully realised. At times these styled songs do not completely work, such as the rather lagging opener \\"Sometimes\\" and the rather sluggish and meandering \\"Around the Bend\\". But solid tracks such as \\"Who Are You\\", \\"Smile\\" and \\"Red Mosquito\\" keep the album flowing nicely, and make for a very solid release.<br /><br />This album is best listened to with an open mind, perhaps even disregarding the fact that this is Pearl Jam, one of the key creators of the Seattle boom, and thinking of them as a pop-rock band. The songs constantly, ranging from hard rock to sombre folk to tribal middle-Eastern styling. Change can be good.d rock to sombre folk to tribal middle-Eastern styling. Change can be good.
0743454537|5.0|As I was looking through the reviews I was shocked because of all the people that think this was a waste of their time. All I can tell you is that this was definately not a waste of my time. I admit that the ending was ironic and depressing but don't you think there are enough books with happy endings that are just dull. This book actually makes you feel something it also gives you a real outlook on life. This is not the first book of hers that I read and I think that this is one of the best. Even though this book has a depressng ending it is a realistic one and I definatelly think that you should give it a shot.
B00022TPT8|5.0|\\"Master of Reality\\" is the epitome of Black Sabbath's monolithic riff-fuelled rock. If you want music with heavy, bluesy and infectious riffs, melodic vocals and breath-taking guitar solos, then look no further than \\"Master of Reality\\".<br /><br />This is one of those special albums where every track has become a classic over the years. It all starts with the fantastic \\"Sweet Leaf\\", which was initially my favourite song on the album. \\"Sweet Leaf\\" kicks the album off in style and lays down the foundations perfectly. The opening cough/splutter sample gives meaning to the title, and sets up one of the most prominent themes and influences for the band - marijuana. This was truly the start of stoner rock. Please don't think that this stupefies the music in any way - an accusation I have heard many a time when listing stoner rock as one of my favourite genres. Yes, this album is a great experience when ripped, as are the best of the modern day stoner albums, but don't be put off thinking a sober state will forge no rewards. Bong or no bong, this is one of the best rock albums ever made.<br /><br />The riffs. Let me talk about some of the timeless riffs on this album. Riffs that over the years have become massively influential and classic in every sense of the word. It is through no chance or overreaction that people nowadays refer to some guitar riffs and leads as \\"Sabbath-esque\\" or \\"Sabbathy\\". The grand onslaught of these riffs starts with the simplistic and contagious lead to \\"Sweet Leaf\\", one of my favourite riffs ever conceived. The glory to this riff, and with the majority of Tony Iommi's genius craft, is the simplicity - sacrificing complex timings, extra ghost notes and fancy finger work for simple motifs. The emphasis is put firmly on execution and groove. Take for example the riff changeups in the fine closer \\"Into The Void\\", going from the fine rolling and laid-back intro riff to some ferocious muted riffing, all complemented perfectly by Ozzy's high and melodic vocals. All of this combines to make one of the album's finest moments. Then there's \\"Children of the Grave\\" which stretches the simplicity to a basic rolling note, repeated in a galloping time signature, augmented by the occasional menacing chord progression. This song was really ahead of its time, paving the way for the galloping marches of the finest Iron Maiden. What makes these riffs even better is the structure of the songs, which are intelligent and keep the various riffs fresh. For example, the changeups in \\"After Forever\\" evolve around a repetitive lead riff which gives way to various themes and new riffs, but always returns to retain the original flow and groove. Call them stoners, but this is intelligent song writing, and something ensued throughout the album.<br /><br />So the song writing is clever. It keeps the riffs fresh and interesting and manages to hold the fantastic groove. However, it is the overall writing and structuring of the album as a whole that I find most impressive. The balance of \\"Master of Reality\\" is perfect and superior to any of their other albums. There are no overly long songs, as all are between 5 and 7 minutes. The effect of this gives the album a special kind of flow that is often lacking in their other releases. \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\" are short little pieces that act as introductions rather than fillers, and again retain the sense of flow as they are not too long or boring.<br /><br />Mention should of course go to Ozzy Osbourne. In my opinion Sabbath simply isn't Sabbath without Ozzy on the vocals. His voice has become one of the most distinctive and acclaimed in rock history, and rightly so. He has what all the best rock singers have - the ability to hit the right notes, often quite high ones, and an idiosyncratic style that is instantly recognisable. The Black Sabbath sound is rounded off perfectly by this master vocalist, best highlighted by his inspired deliveries on \\"Children of the Grave\\" and \\"Into The Void\\".<br /><br/>Any fan of rock music should enjoy this album. It has every ingredient that makes rock so enjoyable - powerful and inspired vocals, stunning guitar solos and riffs, solid bass playing and some stellar drumming. Black Sabbath at the pinnacle of their career.\\".  <br /> <br />Any fan of rock music should enjoy this album.

0515142247|3.0|I have been working my way through the Reacher series and enjoyed them all until this one. Child is excellent at plot and his hero's ability to unravel things through logic is unique. This one falls short in both ways. The plot stops and starts as though Child was puzzle by where to to next. Far less seamless that his others. In addition, far more silly captures and escapes than in the past. No logic just a series of incidents.
B00005NOOH|4.0|No doubt \\"The World at War\\" is probably the BEST documentary ever made about the Second World War but since the beginning I had problems playing this DVD set on various DVD players. I consider myself a serious DVD collector trying to keep every disc as clean as possible and following every instruction to avoid scratches and dirt. I know that the very first DVDs of this series that were sold to public were problematic but i thought mine weren't. Yet, almost three years from purchase, 3 out of 5 discs are completely unplayable althought none of them have no noticeable scratch. Needless to say that I have tested them on many computer DVDs and stand-alone players of various brands without success. I do not know if this problem is related to the fact that these are the only dual-layered & double-sided discs (DVD 18) I have ever seen because the vast majority of DVDs being sold around are single-sided single-layered (DVD5) or single sided double-layered (DVD9) and none of them brought me such headaches. I wasted US$ 99,99 for something I expected to last much much longer.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I am a Jane Eyre fan- read the book many, many times, seen the all other movie versions.  <br />This is my favorite adaption to date. <br />My rating: <br />Five stars for the production, minus a star for no extras on the DVD when the British version has deleted scenes and other features.  I loved the film so much that I am dissapointed that there are no extras and I am considering returning it to get the British version.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|As a fan of Russell's for many years I was looking forward to this film. <br /> <br />I was unable to see it in theaters.   <br /> <br />Having just watched it my head is still spinning. <br />The film went in all sorts of directions.  Why did Ridley have to put funny camera tricks, cheap bargain basement scenes that were supposed to be funny  & belonged in lesser comedy films?    <br /> <br />The music did nothing for me. <br /> <br />1 unnecessary nude scene.  A glimpse, not needed.  And, where did this scene come from?  I must have missed something? <br /> <br />I was disappointed in the film.  With Russell & Ridley working together again IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER. <br /> <br />And of course, something I hate.  NO CHAPTER LIST INSTEAD THE DVD CASE OR A LIST ON THE CASE ITSELF.   <br /> <br />I hope Russell & Ridley's next film \\"American Gangster\\" is better than this film. <br />
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|Flashier remake of the earlier Japanese hit, although still an entertaining flick.  It doesn't seem plausible (in today's American culture) to hide dance lessons from one's wife solely because one doesn't wish her to think one is unhappy with her efforts at the marriage.  Much more believable is the possible shame of discovery due to culture, as is portrayed in the original.  If you wish to experience a film that dwells more on the true joys of dance (rather than sexual tension that seems thrown in to draw a larger audience), and don't mind reading the screen, try the Japanese edition.  The humor of this version is just a tad more vulgar, and definitely lives down to its PG-13 rating.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I had not read the book so I went into this blind. It turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in months. I loved the dry, understated humor, eccentric characters and intelligent script. In that way it reminded me of the buzz I got watching Northern Exposure on TV years ago. Elijah Wood is fabulous. It's funny, it's sad and it delivers a lovely truth about family and our connections. A very intelligent and effective story that I would happily watch again.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|If, like me, you cannot truly understand the demise of intelligent shows written for television, then you'll love this show. Very original and great, compelling story-telling. If you think you won't like it because it is supposed to be a show about Liberal Democrats, then you've missed the point and been mislead. Many of the story lines follow incidents and ideas that Republicans were involved in (such as when Reagan issued a second check to a homeless woman who refused to cash his first one because it was signed by him, whom she respected so much). Enjoy!
0618680004|5.0|Extremely insightful book. As an out-of-the-closet atheist who was raised Christian with 13 years of catholic schooling, I can say from my experience that Dawkins hit the nail directly on the head.  For the most part this book reinforces the conclusions I had drawn on the stance of religion and the concept of a god, while at the same time giving countless examples of how religious superstition manifests itself in our civilization and the negative impact it has continuously had on our species.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, for people like myself to read this book is simply `preaching to the choir'. The people who would benefit most from this book are the very people who will most likely never read it - either out of defiance, fear of sin, or concern that it may shake their worldview to the point of questioning `unshakeable' faith. If ones faith is so strong and unchangeable, then one should have no qualms with putting faith to the test by reading this book.  <br /> <br />It is also comforting to know that there are people out there who fortunately have been able to break free from the shackles of religion, open their minds to common sense and rational thought, and show that it is not impossible to do. I struggled for nearly 10 years since the first time I questioned the `faith' that was forced on to me as a child. Funny thing is, the further I am distanced from religion, looking back at it from a stance as a third-party observer, the more and more absurd it seems. I cannot now understand how anybody, including myself, ever believed such outlandish tales. Moreover, as Dawkins points out, it is terrifying how these superstitions continue to drive politics (particularly U.S., British, and Middle-Eastern) and trigger/perpetuate meaningless war in the name of ones particular belief system; how, as Dawkins points out, it breeds an \\"in-group\\" mentality that if your not one of us, you're against us. If you are a Christian/Jew who hates Muslims (or vice versa) because you believe they are `evil', you are just as much part of the problem as the very people you hate. The `my god/faith is better than your god/faith' mentality spreads war and is ludicrous given it is based on differing views of mythology and evidence-less superstition.  <br /> <br />As I am now finished ranting :) the one criticism I will make of Dawkins is that he uses very large words that aren't commonly used, which make him difficult to understand at times. This book definetly should be read at least once by every school student worldwide, regardless of religious status. Perhaps there is still hope for our species.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I had never heard of  Corinne Bailey Rae until I saw her on the Grammy's. An immediate email went out to my personal musicologist (my son) who responded with: \\"Of course\\". As I listened to the 1st playing of this CD in my music chamber (my car), tears came to my eyes. It wasn't the music, it wasn't the words, as wonderful as they are. I cried because of the SOUND of Corinne Bailey Rae's voice. And then I realized that there was only one other singer who had ever caused such a reaction in me before that point: my #1 favorite Billie Holiday.  <br />
B00004RFDW|5.0|This is truly a GREAT movie--its story, acting (Pacino and Crowe are superb), directing, and set design. It has all the ingredients of a great true-to-life thriller. To some it will be quite an eye opener about the lengths the giant cigarette companies will go to protect and enhance their investment at the expense or harm of their loyal customers. Also, what happens when one of its scientist blows the whistle and the dire consequences that follow in his business and personal life. DON'T MISS THIS ONE! It's message and delivery are PERFECT.
B00005JOML|2.0|I was one of many who watched and loved the original series. No, its not the pastels and glitz of Miami Beach of the earlier years, but rather the final years of the show where it was more dark.  A lot of people forget about that.  I heard and saw the previews and was totally excited to see this. Thank God! I missed the boat so to speak on the theater and saw the DVD.  If I would have had to pay full price to see this piece of poo, I would have been extremely dissapointed.  <br />There was no chemistry between any of the characters, except maybe Tubbs and Trudy. And that was only for a few minutes.  Even the scenes with Farrell and Gong were forced.  I was expecting at least a glimpse of the buddy cop movie with the intensity that was there.  The movie went on too long to not have any humor, especially when employing Jamie Foxx, come on, Jamie Foxx, comedian from In Living Color! Use the talent that you have.  <br />The cinematography was the high point here.  I belive it was filmed in 2005 when there were several hurricanes that skirted the area and made for some realistic footage. <br />If you were born after 1990 you probably would like this. The music is good, even for an old lady like me, but there just isn't any element that is similar to the original show except for the names and a couple similarities to episodes from the TV show, Smugglers Blues, The Great McCarthy and I'm sure a few more that escape my mind.  But Mr. Mann, if you wanted to make a movie about the Miami drug trade but didn't want it to have any resemblance to the original show, rename the characters and call the movie something else!  How about Miami Dumps!
B00009P1O0|5.0|The last album in Neil's \\"ditch trilogy\\" provides a remarkable insight into Neil's music and his personal life and it is one of Neil's best albums. <br /> <br />\\"Walk On\\" is that real catchy country/rock pop tune with riffs and hooks, a style Young seldom showcased. \\"See The Sky About to Rain\\" had been around for a number of years and is a tender ballad with some nice steel pedal guitar and organ work. \\"Revolution Blues\\" is Neil at the top of his game. The banjo comes out on \\"For the Turnstiles\\" along with Neil singing in a real high pitched voice, it has a real rough charm to it, as does most of Neil's stuff. \\"Vampire Blues\\" is a little bluesy rock number. The title track is a moving and atmospheric delight, close your eyes and immerse yourself for 7 minutes. Some great lines in that song. \\"Motion Pictures\\" is a raw acoustic ballad with some nice guitar fills, some honest lyrics and a nice melody. The closing track would be one of his finest compositions, a near 9 minute acoustic narrative song, more organic, earthy and moving than any of Bob Dylan's tunes of similar length. <br /> <br />This album is best listened to at night.

B00005JKQ6|1.0|Fank Peryy's banal description of the charater of the anti-hero (Burt Lankaster) makes you bored to death. It would be a great idea that a man swims from one swimming pool to another to go to the place where he wants to reach, but the visual realisation of the idea is so banal that you will not be able to keep watching the film. Fank Peryy is a third-rate director who cannot direct his actor to describe the unnamable fear in the surburb. Fank Peryy appears in his own film \\"On the Bridge\\" as himself who suffers from cancer in 1992.  In the film he shows us himself who fights a heroic fight against his own cancer, but again the description of the heroic action is so banal that you just only feel sympathy with him. The film cannot give you an alternative description of a struggle between life and death. In that sense, Fank Peryy is one of the worst documentarists in the film history. We should see Frederick Wiseman's excellent documentaries. Fank Peryy dies from cancer in 1995 at the age of 65.  His life seems terrible, judging from his terrible films.
B00005JP97|5.0|I was drawn to this movie because I enjoyed director Craig Brewer's earlier film, \\"Hustle and Flow\\".  If anything, I liked \\"Black Snake Moan\\" even better.  The movie combines tawdry and lurid components with a tale of love, forgiveness, and hope.  I don't think the film is exploitative. Instead it suggests in a simple way how sensual and redemptive parts of life often complement each other.<br /><br />In thinking about this movie, I was reminded of George Eliot's novel, \\"Silas Marner\\", the bane of every high school student.  In Eliot's novel, Marner, an embittered miser finds redemption when he raises Eppie, an orphaned girl, from childhood to young adulthood. Similarly, \\"Black Snake Moan\\" tells the story of a middle-aged black American man, Lazarus, portrayed by Samuel Jackson, who feels embittered when Rose, his wife of 12 years, leaves him for his best friend.  Lazarus happens upon a young scantily dressed white woman, Rae, played by Christina Ricci,  who has been beaten and left near-dead on a country road following a wild party.  Lazarus takes her into his home and tries to teach and care for her.  Ultimately, the movie suggests, both Lazarus and Rae receive a kind of hope, Rae by marrying her boyfriend, Lazarus by finding what may be a promising new relationship.<br /><br />The story gets life through a great deal of tawdry sex.  At the turning point of the movie, Lazarus chains Rae to a radiator to prevent her escape.  Rae was a victim of sexual abuse and a neglectful mother, and in her boyfriend's temporary absence for military service, she throws herself at every man she can find. She appears in the movie scantily clad, in a cut-off blouse with a Confederate flag and in shorts. Lazarus has his own frustrations to work out from the loss of Rose, his wife.  A black preacher, the Reverend R.L., played by John Cotham, helps both Lazarus and Rae and is the quiet hero of this movie.<br /><br />In this movie, atmosphere and scene count for a great deal.  The story is set in a small Tennessee town near Nashville, and the story is redolent with poor Southern life, both black and white.  There is scenes in shacks and farms, and small town stores and streets, and in clubs and bars that bring the movie to life.  Brewer shows the same love for and knowledge of the rural South that he showed in \\"Hustle and Flow\\". Most importantly there is music.  The tale of sex and redemption is captured in the flow of the blues in a soundtrack and in performances by Lazarus himself.  Jackson spent long hours learning the blues guitar in preparation for this movie.  The movie includes two scenes of footage with the great Delta bluesman Son House holding forth appropriately on love, loss, and the blues.  Music is a redemptive force in people's lives, and in this movie of the hot-blooded South, redemption comes through the blues.<br /><br />I found the tawdry elements of this movie an essential part of the story it had to tell. \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is rewarding.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanssee town near Nashville, and the story is redolent with poor Southern life, both black and white.

B00000F1L3|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a kid and now my kids are watching and loving it as well.  High quality production and enthralling story make for a timeless classic.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Few thrillers remain as consistantly thrilling and exciting as \\"The Fugitive\\", the 1993 cinematic adaption of the classic television series. Thanks to a fantastic script, excellent directing and two dynamic leads, \\"The Fugitive\\" is a masterpiece in every aspect.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble (originally played by the late David Janssen in the tv series), a respected Chciago surgeon who comes home one night to find his wife (Seal Ward) bludgeoned to death, and him framed for her murder. Despite his best efforts, Kimball finds himself convicted for murder and facing wrongful punishment by the law.<br /><br />Not willing to let his wife's murder escape jsutice, Kimball stages a daring escape from a train heading towards a state penitentiary (one of the greatest scenes ever), and becomes the most wanted man in the state.<br /><br />Put in charge of apprehending him is no-nonsense U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, who is determined to bring Kimball to justice.<br /><br />This begins a tense game of cat and mouse that never lets up. Richard manages to evade remais one step ahead of the law and gets closer and closer to finding the true killer, but Gerard will not give up. This leads to one of the most thrillin climaxes in film history.<br /><br />\\"The Fugitive\\" is moviemaking at its best, and belongs in all dvd collections.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|OMG!!!... I'm a kid of the 80's and this is like a fresh new album from the 80's!  Especially tracks 1 & 3, they are so authentic 80's I wondered if they were really from that time... Creepy! <br /> <br />Lyrics are geniusly silly and fun.  Some Wham! or Modern Talking fans will either love it or hate it.  ;) <br /> <br />The more contemporary songs are worth the listen... the experience of listening to the whole album is almost like watching the movie itself over and over again... and smiling at every twist.  Especially track 5 which came straight of the movie.  Very heart-warming duet by Grant and Barrymore.  Be prepared to hear track 11 in Intel's new TV commercial... very catchy! <br /> <br />Yeah... Hugh Grant cracks me up both in the movies and now.. in this soundtrack too! :)  Glad I went to watch this movie with my 90's kid gf... and she loved it too, and bought me this CD.  Xoxo! <br /> <br />This is the best soundtrack for me this year.  Never felt this way since Frankie said \\"Relax\\"... Viva 80s!!!
B0009UC810|5.0|One of the most popular sketches in the early days of \\"Saturday Night Live\\" was The Blues Brothers, a duo of blues lovin' brothers portrayed by Dany Aykroyd and John Belushi. The sketch became so enormously successful that when Aykroyd and Belushi departed the show in 1980, the sketch got a feature film.<br /><br />\\"The Blues Brothers\\" tells the tale of Jake (Belushi) and Elwood (Aykroyd), The Blues Brothers. Searching for redmeption and trying to raise some cash, Jake and Elwood go on a cross country road trip to put back together their old band and earn some dough. In their wake, they leave a trail of chaos and destruction, and leads the cops on a wild goose chase to put Jake and Elwood behind bars. Hilarity, excitement and fantastic music ensues, and the reuslt is a classic comedy filled with great music and lots of laughs, not to metnion unforgettable cameos by soul legends such as James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin.<br /><br />This 25th anniversary edition is loaded with extras, and the film itself is one that belongs in all dvd collections.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|Jason Reitman's Thank You For Smoking is a well written, well acted satire on the political correctness of the late 1990's. The film tells the story of tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) as he goes through the process of bringing smoking back to the movies and in turn reconnecting with his young son. <br /> <br />The film has a great ensemble cast and witty dialogue but doesn't really develop its story line to the point I would have hoped. As political satire it walks a thin line between high comedy and silliness. <br /> <br />The high point of the disc comes in its special features. The disc offers two commentaries, an episode of the Charlie Rose show, two making of featurettes and various art galleries. <br /> <br />This really could have been a great  movie as it turns out it was merely good. Worth a rental.
B000FZETIO|4.0|Though not as good as \\"Sixteen Candles\\", \\"The Breakfast Club\\", \\"Weird Scienece\\" or \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", \\"Pretty In Pink\\", like all the John Hughes produced 1980s' teen classics, is a highly enjoyable teen romp.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald, Hughes' muse for these movies, plays Andie Walsh, a smart hiugh schooler who lives with her deadbeat dad (the always wonderful Harry Dean Stanton) and is generally in the company of her friends, namely the carefree Duckie (Jon Cryer in a classic performance). Pining for Andy's affection is Blane McDonnagh, a rich and very popular student who wants to take Andie to the prom. This does not sit well with Duckie, who's harboured a secret crush on Andie since he's known her. Backstabbing, lies, and heartache ensues, but it leads up to a great conclusion.<br /><br />\\"Pretty In Pink\\" is not as good as its predecessor, but it's still a very solid and entertaining teen comedy.

B000000W5H|5.0|This is my favorite Stones album for sheer listening pleasure.  It may not be as weighty or as blues-based as some of their other work, but it strikes a chord with me every time I listen to it.  The songs are extremely good, with the rich, layered sound found on albums featuring guitar virtuoso Mick Taylor.  After Taylor's departure, the Stones' music has a leaner, edgier sound.  There's nothing at all wrong with that, but Taylor's melodic ear contributed so much to the Stones' music when he was with them.<br /><br />'Time Waits for No One' is a masterpiece on many levels, as is 'Till the Next Goodbye', plus the album has the additional classic 'It's Only Rock and Roll\\".  Many of the songs are less known, but are equal to the Stones' great works that preceded and followed this album.  There is a nice mix of hard rock, blues, ballad, reggae, and humor.<br /><br />Sure, the Stones did edgier work, but this one is just plain fun to listen to and never seems to wear out its welcome on my turntable.<br /><br />Five stars.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins applies his writing skill, argumentative strength and faultless logic to the hypothesis that an all-powerful supernatural being exist. He finds the hypothesis unlikely in the extreme: \\"I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there\\".    Dawkins reviews several arguments for belief in God, finding each of them wanting. He criticizes those who explain the Universe by assuming a creator whose existence would be much more remarkable than the fact that there is a Universe. That way, says Dawkins, we are left with an even bigger question: how could a God of such great complexity have come to exist? The answer \\"God created it\\" thus solves nothing. Only a process like natural selection is known to have brought forth complexity and intelligence.    Dawkins is critical of various common ideas. Agnostics need to answer questions about probability: why do they assign very low probability to the existence of Zeus, Wotan, and an invisible flying teapot, but give the impression that the particular God they call themselves agnostic about, has about a 50% chance of existing? \\"I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.\\"    He is also critical of undue 'respect' awarded to religious beliefs, people and institutions. The notion that religion is needed for ethical behavior is adequately dealt with: there is no reason in scripture, philosophy or actual facts (e.g. crime rates in different regions) to support that assertion. New is Dawkins' criticism of the habit of labeling children 'Christians' or 'Muslims'. As an example, he refers to a newspaper photo caption doing this to 4-year-olds: \\"Just imagine the outcry if the caption had read, 'Shadbreet (an Atheist), Musharaff (an Agnostic) and Adele (a Secular Humanist), all aged four'. Mightn't the parents actually be investigated to see if they were fit to bring up children?\\"    Most controversial, however, is Dawkins' criticism of moderate religion. He thinks that moderates create room for fundamentalists, by making it acceptable to believe things without evidence and by proclaiming articles of faith that, when taken literally, would be contrary to our democratic way of life. Of course, moderates don't take everything they 'believe' literally, but they make it easier for others to do so. Extremists do evil, \\"not because they have been possessed by Satan, but because they have been brought up, from the cradle, to have total and unquestioning faith.\\"    If some of this is controversial, at least it is presented in the strongest possible way. This collection of arguments is indispensable for anyone who is truly interested in a discussion about the subject. Whether that includes most, many, or just a few religious people, I don't know.
B000M341QE|5.0|When people ask me wha my favorite movie is I always say it's more about directors rather that actual titles. Martin Scorcesse never lets me down in that department. This year he graces the movie going public with yet another exciting and all out fun shoot'em up twisted up masterpiece in 'The Departed'<br /><br />How can you say anything bad about this movie? I had spoken to about 20-35 different people who had seen this movie in the theaters and not once did I hear a single negative word towards it. The cast couldn't get any better, this is the best cast Scorcesse put together since Goodfellas. Matt Damon Boston native extrodiare and Leo DiCaprio put on probably their best performances of their careers and each were in two very well put together movies on their own this same year. I was shocked that neither got a nomination for best actor for this movie. Eventhough DiCaprio got a nomination for Blood Diamond it was a stll a shock. The great Jack never lets you down with his intimidating on screen presence and his signature wit and classic quotables. Probably the best performace in this movie was Mark Walberg. He was a power house and really knew how to do that Bostonian accent to a tee.<br /><br />All and all if you are a fan of great mob movies its your movie. If you are into big casts its your movie. If you are into artsy films that can possibly win best picture of the year...oh wait too late, it is  winner for you. This is one of those movies you will probably watch a million times and finally credit was given where credit was sorely due.
1401307450|5.0|I just finished reading this very amazing book. I have to give it five stars, not because I was shocked by the writing skills, or the magical chapters (the writing was OK), but because of the realness and brutal truth displayed throughout the book. Having been a heroin addict myself it was easy for me to relate to the book and to what AK was feeling.  I have been a RHCP fan since I was a teen and this made me feel more connected to the band and AK.  The book talks a lot about touring, other bands such as Nirvana (very interesting stuff). <br /> <br />I am honestly suprised that some people were \\"shocked\\" by this thief, liar, drug addict person. Or with those who claimed that this book was all about him relapsing and doing drugs. This book was about his life, and drug addiction was part of it, but there is a lot in there about other things such as his childhood, his growing up, touring, etc etc. I trust that those who get this will enjoy it.
B00005JPAM|5.0|i found this movie particularly engaging as i lived in london when princess diana died. at the time of diana's death -- as an american -- it was intensely moving and fascinating to not only sift thru our own feelings but to watch a country work thru its feelings toward an exceptional and unconventional princess and the royalty. <br /> <br />few actresses could portray the queen with the subtlety and humanity helen mirren brings to the role. equally good is the young british actor who plays tony blair as he seeks to bridge the gap between an isolated queen and her people. overall, a sad, engrossing and occasionally even funny look at this chapter in the history of the british royalty.
1400031087|5.0|The hype surrounding this book is great- for the sole purpose that it has asisted Mr. Frey in selling an extraordinary amount of copies of his book.  Many critics will argue that truths have been exaggerated- even fabricated- the point is his message. Drug addiction, rehab centres and jails are so far from pleasant. Simply writing methodically about it would seem dry and tedious to the reader. Frey's account accentuates the rawness of being human and brings home to the reader the horrors of a self destructive life.   Many memoirs lack a natural talent for language but this one does not. Frey does not ever try to ascribe blame for his situation to anyone but himself. He is humble in himself and unaware of his own superior strength- which was also his biggest weakness.  I recommend this book to all, and ask readers why they are so quick to criticise one man's acoount of an experience that only he lived?
B000M5AJQS|5.0|to this viewer, scorcese's change of venue and ethnic group here -- from nyc italian to boston irish -- has stimulated one of his best flicks. this has the vintage scorcese touches: noir novel dialog, masterful cinematography, ubiquitous stones' songs, violence, machine gun pace. the storyline of two guys from tough irish neighborhoods working opposite ends of the police force (undercover trying to nab the mob; mob guy infiltrating the police) is beautifully spun. The Departed -- if it is possible to use these words -- also seems like a kindler, gentler scorcese with all the blood but less pure brutality then goodfellas or casino.  <br />stellar performances abound. for nicholson, wahlberg and damon this is prime territory -- rough boston characters -- and they shine. sheen and baldwin play strong supporting roles. dicaprio is the real surprise, playing a tortured, morally driven young man tormented by undercover work so close to pure evil and the demons of his past. do not expect sunshine and roses here, but thought-provoking, edge of the seat work.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|The previews for this movie were exciting, as the movie was not that<br /><br />exciting, but still a good movie for what if offered. Good acting, and<br /><br />different storylines ermerges you into a movie that is affected by<br /><br />different scenarios that are all related.

If you're even thinking of buying I highly recommend!!!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I own the special edition, but Im glad that they are finally releasing this great movie for all those who missed it when it was available last time. This version is probably the best ever released and the price is pretty reasonable. The special edition was only 1 disk and cost a bit more.<br /><br />Hopefully Pinnochio will be coming soon to Platinum. I have the limited edition and it's a pretty bad transfer (looks like straight from VHS with no clean up). However, Im holding on to it incase they censor the platinum version.<br /><br />I think this re-release of PeterPan is a signal that Disney is seeing the light. They are losing alot of revenue to chinese bootlegs being sold on [...], and god knows [...] doesnt give a crap about enforcement.
B000002L9B|5.0|After listening to this CD recently, I've come to the conclusion that this is my favorite Prince record.  This record is mature, yet funky, with great lyrics and interesting 'sounds'.  I love how the drums stand out on 'New Position' and the funky synth on 'Girls and Boys'. Prince explores jazz with 'Do U Lie'  and 'Sometimes It Snows In April' is simply outstanding.  Buy this record!!!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to DePalma's \\"The Black Dahlia\\"). The political statements about \\"terrorism\\" and how it can be induced by the very same goverment that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independant, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!<br />I have to note that it's a neat coincidence that this is set in the year 2020, just like DePalma's \\"Mission To Mars\\". People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independant thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song \\"The Mob Rules\\", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"1984\\", \\"Logan's Run\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"They Live\\", \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", \\"Metropolis\\", and Micheal Moore's documentary \\"Farenheit 9/11\\", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since \\"Bound\\".<br />We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is concidered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We are quickly declining into a fascist state as long as our current president is in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say \\"Stop!\\" before it's too late. And, it's definetly time to stop all of the hate crimes! Has anyone ever stopped to think that when the Twin Towers fell in NYC, they \\"imploded\\", like a building would do when it is being demolished and bombs are in the BOTTOM of the building, not near one of the top floors! Has anyone ever questioned why Bin Laden's family got free air flight out of the country the day of the 'terrorist' attacks??? And, why did the president feel the need to go after Sadam when it was allegedly Bin Laden that we should have went after? More questions than answers. It's because the terrorist act was committed by our very own government! And I have noticed that after they started taking God out of the USA, the USA has gone downhill like a bobsled on a THICK sheet of ice. I don't mean \\"religion\\", for God and religion are two seperate things all together. And, I don't mean to sound as if I'm defending any kind of religous zealots (fanatics), like our president, who is doing all of this in a very scary religous fervor, while countless people 'sleep' and declare him the best president ever.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|In giving my best effort to take every bit of good out of this movie, i'll offer the following: Excellent cinematography, great acting, and interesting plot. This is my opinion and aims at appeasing those who love this movie. <br /> <br />  Now for the many problems i had with the movie. The plot started off strong and was easy to follow in the beginning, but i soon found myself wondering where this was all going and how it was going to tie together. When the writers finally tied in the rifle ownership to the Japan story, it really screamed last-minute effort to fit all three stories together. <br /> <br />  To address previous comments regarding the inappropriate scenes regarding the underaged actors, it was done for shock value and that's all. The director could have easily portrayed the characters' flaws and vulnerability without going to the lengths that it did. Especially with a little boy masturbating to his sister - i mean, come on. <br /> <br />  My conclusion is that this movie would have gathered much more accolade had it come out a decade earlier, prior to Traffic and Crash. The fact that it succeeded these films put it at a great dissadvantage with extremely high standards. If you want to watch a movie that integrates several stories and ties them together in a well-balanced, intruiging, intricate fashion, then watch Traffic or Crash. Babel feeds off the foundation set by these types of films, but comes up short in a forced fashion analogous to a child jamming a puzzle piece in the incorrect place.
0765348276|3.0|This book passed the most basic \\"worth picking up?\\" litmus test: I enjoyed reading it. It was fun, I always wanted to keep reading, and there were many interesting and imaginative things therein. (There were also a few moments that made me laugh out loud; generally a plus.)<br /><br />That being said, it was a fairly one-dimensional sort of enjoyment - almost entirely \\"hey, neat setting!\\", and interesting events springing from that neat setting.<br /><br />But the characters didn't really grab me, and didn't feel very deep - especially for people who'd lived 75 years! Equally disappointing was the minimal exploration (on a psychological / sociological level, not an aches-and-pains level) of that 75-year age - one of the core things which fundamentally separates the premise from, say, Starship Troopers or other sci-fi war novels, not to mention the source of the title for the book.<br /><br />Overall: I'm not sorry I picked up this book, but I am glad I waited for paperback.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|I heard about this movie from a friend who RAVED up and down about how deep, hardcore, and heart wrenching this film was. I had always meant to pick it up but just ended up walking by it in blockbuster. I eventually decided to rent it and see what all the fuss was about. I had seen the preview and was quite intrigued, this looked fresh and unique!<br /><br />Sadly, this film tried way too hard to be all the things my friend said it was. I feel that the only people who will really enjoy this movie are \\"indie\\" high school kids who think very highly of their intellect. When this movie started, all I could say to myself was \\"Are these high school kids??? Does this take place in high school....? I mean, they have lockers so it must....\\" Some reviewers have said that the dialogue of these kids was \\"edgey\\" in a word. You could barely understand the characters. I'm sorry, but when people sit down to watch a movie they don't want to have to pause it every 5 minutes to process what the characters just said. Because of the contrived and overly ambitious lingo of this film, its very hard to understand whats even going on half the time. I'm still not even really sure what the point of the whole story was at the end.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because the acting was fabulous and the cinematography and camera work was probably what made me keep watching. But overall, this is a very pretentious peice of work. Its just trying to be something that it isn't...and it fails. It crashes and burns when it comes to being a noir detective thriller. The average American audience would not even be able to follow the story. And while I'm all for trying new and unique story lines and dialogue, sometimes you just have to realistic and realize that not everyone wants to get a headache trying to figure out the movie's plot.<br /><br />And another thing....WHERE WERE THESE KID'S PARENTS????!!!!!
B00004CWO8|1.0|I bought this recording for my 5 & 3 year-old grandchildren who love ballet. There was nothing in the Amazon literature to indicate the homosexual slant of the production. The kids and I were half-way through viewing it when I realized what was being passed off was truly counter culture. The principal women (mom & girlfriend) were evil and stupid respectively. The \\"hero\\"s\\" true love was an undisguised male swan (all the swans were male). There was no hiding the passion between the male lovers. Good grief!! [...]
B00005JPG1|4.0|First off, many of the reviewers have commented on the length of Zodiac.  It is 160 minutes long and I fall into the camp that felt the movie was on the long side.  It is an excellent film but I felt that the momentum was not very strong toward the end of the movie.  The story is told as events happened, date by date. This gives the narrative flow an episodic quality that sometimes seems disconnected.  There are also so many characters involved in the story that are easy to loose track of; for example, a movie projectionist suspected by Robert Graysmith was not well defined as a character and another character named Linda (who gave Graysmith some critical information) was difficult to connect to the story.  I kept wondering who Linda was and how she fit into the story until the dialogue revealed her significance.  It might have been a good idea to have included some a scene or two to introduce us to the first Zodiac victims since they play a pivotal part in Graysmith's later research.   <br /> <br />All of this said Zodiac is a remarkable film with excellent performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Robert Graysmith portraying him as a soft-spoken cartoonist who becomes obsessed with discovering who Zodiac is, and Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as columnist Paul Avery.  Mark Ruffalo is great as Inspector and becomes the hard working cop who gives Graysmith some off-the-record support. Chloe Sevigny is very good as Graysmith's wife and John Carroll Lynch (perhaps better know for his role in Fargo) makes a chilling suspect.  Brian Cox is great in the small role of attorney Marvin Belli. <br /> <br />Zodiac seamlessly re-creates the late 60's and 1970's and is beautifully photographed by Harris Savides.  Zodiac is a film of the investigation of the Zodiac murders more than it is a murder mystery; we know nothing about the killer, as did the people who were trying to solve the murders.  We discover, as Robert Graysmith did, how the investigation was hampered by multiple jurisdictions with too many people performing the investigation but no one to lead them.  I am a fan of director David Fincher's Seven; he has created a thought provoking look at the Zodiac investigation.            <br />

B000M341QE|5.0|Does this movie scream Hollywood..?? oh yeah!!!... and are there some flaws in the film..?? I believe there are.. YES.. for instance    (there is a lack of character development with the shrink, and the film at times romantisizes her role in the film making her enigmatic character even more difficult to understand..  Also, although I loved the music (lots of Stones and that great \\"Well Well Well\\" from Lennon's Primal Scream album, the Pink Floyd cover shmaltz (i.e. DiCaprio's love making scene) was pretty over the top..   that's where I can agree with critics who may have felt that they were drinking Diet Scorcese and not the regular Scorcese...     That being said...    Scorcese uses cinimetography to his every   advantage in this film... his Hitchcock like use of camera angles..  his direction produces a wide spectrum of vantage points  and the movie rides much more like a Thriller than   any other Scorsese movie I've ever seen.. In the end,  I come away with the feeling that I've just seen a heck  of a film despite its flaws.. and I want to see it again..   intriguing characters  exploring their own vulnerability and trying to see cleary   the differences between right and wrong. Jack Nicholson,  Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio turn in the greatest trio  of male drama acting I've ever seen in a film.. and that's saying a  lot.. they are superb!!!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky.<br /><br />The labyrinth plot focuses on shy, taciturn Joel Barish, who is swept off his feet by the raucous, unstable Clementine. Much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight, he discovers that Clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called Lacuna headed by the benevolent Dr. Mierzwiak. A renowned leader in his field of memory erasure, Mierzwiak treats the heartbroken Joel to the same procedure as Clementine's. However, Joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of Clementine. The surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from Joel's plight.<br /><br />It helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued Jim Carrey as the depressed Joel. This is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though Gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate. Displaying no trace of her corseted Britishness as the bedraggled free spirit Clementine, Kate Winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness. Tom Wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood. All three are fine with Dunst particularly affecting toward the end.<br /><br />The looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, production designer Dan Leigh and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir, all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes. The only fly in the ointment is Jon Brion's overly intrusive music. The 2004 DVD has several extras, the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by Gondry and Kaufman, which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns. There are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with Gondry and Carrey that borders on banal. Seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included, as well as a creative music video of The Polyphonic Spree's \\"Night and Day\\" and a faux-commercial for Lacuna.eady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood.

B00000JGHM|5.0|...he'd be a man of my dreams if he wasn't a criminal...<br /><br />I love Al Pacino and every movie he's done except \\"The Devil's Advocate\\"... Al's performance here is flawless and I expected nothing less... His character, however, is not nearly as impressive... In his third failing marriage, this guy's priority is clearly not his relationships... Incapable of intimacy, poor pathetic soul chases the bad guys so intensely that he has nothing left to give to the woman he supposedly loves... Why not stay single instead and concentrate on what you're good at?... Nope, did not like this guy in the least... I found myself mesmerized by the character played by De Niro instead... To my surprise, De Niro's performance was top notch as well... I'm not a big fan of De Niro - I don't consider him as talented of an actor as Pacino - but I was blown away by his performance in \\"Heat\\"... How can a bad guy be so good?... His brand of self-control and self-discipline gave me goosebumps!... His ability to make a split-second decision and stick to it without looking back would make him a top notch candidate for an executive...Instead, he robes banks...Like his opponent, Pacino, he is very good at what he does, so good in fact, that he earns an admiration and respect of the man desperately trying to chase him down... De Niro has not been in a relationship before - unlike Pacino he understands the demands of his livelihood and stays clear from anything that he can't walk away from on a moment's notice when he \\"feels the heat around the corner\\"... This will change, but I don't want to completely spoil the movie for you... De Niro kills - once hesitantly (5 seconds of a pause is an eternity for a man who can make decisions in a fraction of a second) when forced by a trigger happy sociopath who unfortunately took part in one of his gigs, and twice to settle a score... Paradoxically, this criminal has a strong sense of honor, loyalty and justice... Yes, I like him, I like him a lot... He reminds me of Pacino's Carlito in \\"Carlito's Way\\", another movie I love...minds me of Pacino's Carlito in \\"Carlito's Way\\", another movie I love...
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of \\"Lost\\" is quite simply compelling viewing.  While Season 1 poses more questions than answers, Season 2 delivers in more detail the promise of the premise and introduces a whole new set of characters.  The further development of character backstory, analysis of religious, social, and political themes as well as an outstanding final third of the season all add up to riveting entertainment.  Highly recommended!

0375758992|5.0|This book had been calling to me ever since it was printed in hardcover, but I didn't listen until the paperback was on the bargain table. Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight by Alexandra Fuller is the best book that I have read in a long while. I have a little bit of an obsession with Africa going on right now, but I think this memoir has a broader appeal: anyone that strongly identifies with the land in which they grew up, anyone that takes pride in their family -- warts and all. <br /> <br />Bobo, the author's girlhood name, spent much of her youth in then-Rhodesia-now-Zimbabwe, during that emerging nation's civil war for independence from Britain. Bobo's father fought in and lost the war, Mugabe came to power, and the situation changed for white expatriates. The Fullers moved around, from Zimbabwe to Malawi to Zambia, managing tobacco farms and cattle ranches to make ends meet. Underneath this external turmoil, the impersonal hardships of Africa frequently hit very close to home and the relationships among the members of the Fuller family were tested. It was only later that Mrs. Fuller's (Bobo's mother) mental illness was medically diagnosed, but it manifested itself often enough during the author's childhood. <br /> <br />Alexandra Fuller captured well the seeming paradox of being in love with Africa, and her story at once conveys the extreme beauty and the sometimes terrible costs of being a living part of such a wild place. At one point, as a small girl left without the protection of her mother, Bobo drank from the wrong cistern of water. After a day of being violently ill and close to dying, she managed to pull through. That evening, as she was trying to fall asleep, she realized that she never wanted to leave Africa. The hardships of that place put life in sharper contrast. <br /> <br />I look forward to the next piece of non-fiction written by Ms. Fuller about Africa.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|I enjoy movies that take me places. This one took me on several journies that eventually intersected in sometimes intriguing ways, and sometimes strange ways.<br /><br />The story of the tower of Babel in Genesis depicts a time when humanity attempted to construct a tower to reach the heavens in rebellion against God.  As a result, God confounded society with differing tongues, or language barriers.<br /><br />Mexican director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu strikes a chord in the movie Babel, as we witness traumatic events unfolding in the lives of four families who become intertwined as the result of their experience with the babble of today's society and it's political rhetoric, along with individual inability or unwillingness to communicate constructively.<br /><br />An American family, portrayed by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, experience an awakening in Morocco through a random act of violence from two young Turkish brothers experimenting with a weapon purchased by their father to keep their goatherds safe from jackals.  Meanwhile, the Americans' Hispanic nanny experiences her own turmoil when attempting to recross the U.S. border with the family's children after attending her son's wedding.  In Japan, a widowed father and his deaf daughter experience a shift in their dynamics as authorities trace the weapon used in the violent act in Morocco.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is intense even if the story lags a bit and exhibits some disturbing scenes that I would have rather not viewed.  However, if I had had the opportunity to view this movie before the announcement of the Oscar nominations for this year, I would have given the same nominations to Adriana Barraza in her role as the nanny, and Rinko Kikuchi playing the deaf girl, for their riveting best supporting actress performances.<br /><br />The brilliantly stark and revealing cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto made me feel as though I was in the crowd witnessing these events as they unfolded. And the mezmerizing music from Argentine composer Gustavo Santaolalla turned many corners throughout the movie to completely enhance every scene, whether at a family wedding in Mexico, the barren terrain of Morroco, or the clubs and high rises Japan.<br /><br />It seems people either love or hate this movie.  I always tend to look for the message and what speaks to me and this movie spoke to me as a relevant lesson in the need for individual and cultural understanding.<br /><br />- Victoria Austinposer Gustavo Santaolalla turned many corners throughout the movie to completely enhance every scene, whether at a family wedding in Mexico, the barren terrain of Morroco, or the clubs and high rises Japan.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|I didn't know anything about Corinne Bailey Rae until I saw her one-hour live concert special on DirecTV.  I loved her voice as soon as she opened her mouth.  She reminds me of a young Sade, very neo-soul and soothing.  Her entire CD is easy listening from beginning to end.  If you like Sade, Jill Scott and Kindred the Family Soul, you'll love Corinne.  Her sound is a little different than those above, but it's in the same genre.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Hard to put into words the infectious groove these two brilliant musicians capture, suffice to say: brilliant. As a fan of both, but particularly Clapton, I was expecting a very good album, but this exceeds all expectations. My favorites are the rollicking \\"Ride the River\\" and the slow, bluesy \\"Hard to Thrill\\", but the point is that there isn't a clunker on the album; you'll play it over and over again from track 1 to track 14 without skipping one!   <br />
B00005JPG1|5.0|I couldnt disagree more with some of the common complaints i hear about this movie. in my personal opinion, people seem to dislike everything that makes this movie so great and fresh. A previous reviewer stated that this \\"documentary-like renactment....is not cinematic or captivating\\" which seems to be a plea against parts of Finchers directing style which i feel are exactly what Hollywood needs. The documentary-like renactment is the opposite of the cheesy overdramatic (and \\"cinematic and captivating\\" as some would call it) types of conventional hollywood films which provide narrow and one-sided perspectives and in which you are forced to like the deemed good guys and hate the deemed bad guys (going against this, Fincher shows the incomptence and inter-departmental jealousy of the police but doesnt force you to have a negative perspective of them), and in which the morals of the plot are forced onto you. In this \\"documentary-like renactment\\", Fincher - as he usually does  -  allows the audience to decide the importance of events for themselves and even thier judgement and opinion of the characters themselves. This sort of open-endedness is typical of Fincher and what made Seven (in which you could have even agreed with the justification of the antagonist) and Fight Club (in which you could have sided with ANYTHING) such huge milestones in film. At the same time, Zodiac does give some guidance and direction to those rather passive audience members who tend to be less free-thinkers and need to be handed the truth because it gives the viewpoint of Jake Greysmith who's account of events is most popular today (and is, at the same time, open to dispute).  <br />*VAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD - DO NOT READ IF YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE CASE (WHICH IS PRETTY WELL CIRCULATED KNOWLEDGE, ANYWAYS)* <br />The so-called \\"unresolved ending\\" is, first of all, NOT unresolved. It is perfectly befitting for a true crime genre story because not only does it reveal to you who the bad guy is (whichis not even definite - just according to jake greysmith anyway), but there is a sort of pleasurable feeling of insight on the audience (given you have some wit) that although the police didnt bust the guy after so much investigation, you get to know who perhaps the most notorious serial killer of the 20th century is (and all you spent was approx 3 hrs). Yeah welcome to postmodern stories where its not always ending in \\"happily ever after...\\". Perhaps, this is what makes David Fincher one of the only directors who makes movies with true postmodern plots. An ending with the protagonist merely knowing who the con is and looking him in the eye is a very resolved ending in postmodern literature and im glad Fincher tends to stick with the sort of plots that emply these sorts of endings as opposed to the sort where the \\"hero\\" goes to the evil man's mansion, kills 50 guys, saves the girl, and goes home scot-free.

I agree with how their childhood love didn't seem to hold too deep especially to span so many years.  As the movie went on and things happend I found myself thinking back and how it wasn't what I thought and silly of me to not realize it then.  I also watched the Presteige which was a decent movie as well but it just lacked some things and I found myself enjoying this movie more.  I agree the Prince deal was a little overboard but I did enjoy the movie.  Definately worth another watch.

B0002ZDVEU|1.0|This is total nonsense.  I defy anyone to figure out what is supposed to be going on.  Have you ever watched a rapid sequence of screen cuts?  Where no shot remains on the screen for more than one or two seconds?  Sometimes it can be effective - for about a minute or so.  Five minutes is far too long.  Fifteen minutes of that stuff is excruciating.  Try watching two hours of this non-stop.  All accompanied by pounding meaningless music.  You had better overdose on Excedrin before watching this ripoff, a pure cash-in on the popularity of \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" which had some of this, but was at least watchable, with a coherent storyline, taken from the novel.  But this is just utterly meaningless pretentious crap, with no rhyme or reason, a continuous stream of screen cuts, with people running around, barking orders, doing incomprehensible things, all presumably to make us think that something important is happening.  Take my word for it, absolutely nothing is happening, except that your money is being stolen.  U.C.L.A. Film School created a Frankenstein, an endless parade of pretentious directors making pretentious films, that utilize \\"cinematic technique\\" for its own sake, and turn it into an end unto itself, instead of a means to an end.  Films like this are the ultimate and inevitable result.  Don't waste your money - unless you enjoy a good headache.
0060786523|4.0|Considered to be one of the seminal works of fiction in the Indian literary space, by sheer size this book definitely is foreboding to the average reader. It took me a few weeks to get through this tome. With all the hype and hoopla surrounding this book during the release about 10 years back , the end result was a marginal let down. To the authors credit, the reader never has to go through the page 15 syndrome, the reading is light throughout , the characters are well etched and there never is a moment when the events are overdrawn. There are very few books which describe post independence India very well and the choice of the period is definitely interesting, also rather than get stuck in a quagmire of \\"explaining\\" the depth of poverty, this book deals with a cross section of individuals who cut across various levels. Centered on a lady in a middle class family in small town India, the book comes a good circle from a family marriage to the marriage of the central character. You have a view of the cross section of society in Purva Pradesh (a fictional state in India - this could well have been Uttar Pradesh) , the upper echelons of society in Calcutta with a few characters from Delhi, Kanpur<br /><br />The author tries hard at providing each character the depth and each chapter by itself stands out as a lesson in history with a backdrop of India struggling to live up to the ideals with which it had been conceived . We have a set of principled politicians , communal harmony and discord, the workings in a colonial firm bereft of the British, poetry, feudalism struggling against empowerment, nepotism and bureaucracy. Per-se this by itself is a fantastic achievement as somehow this is weaved into the core tale of finding a groom for Lata, and inevitably the links can be drawn back to the main theme.<br /><br />You get a sense of the let down in the final pages of the book wherein I did feel that some of the events which led to the final outcome were a bit forced. For a book that was meandering for most like the river which is the thread to most of the settings , the last few events are a rush - a half baked assault , a choice of a groom which is badly explained and a lot of loose hanging threads. Had a strong feeling of fatigue in the storyline by the end. There are some unnecessary references to senior leaders like Nehru which seem to have been cut short and rather than lending to the storyline , stand out as unnecessary distractions<br /><br />Nevertheless much of the book has ample charm and as I have already stated, this is a setting that is marked by optimism rather than pathos (which is the theme of most of the post-independence novels) and it does give a lot of insight into the society of the period.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I am surprised at some of the negative reviews on the site. I think people expect Norah to be a pop diva. This she is not. 'Thinking about you' is the closest that she gets to the idiom of her first two solo albums. With the rest she is pushing frontiers. There are some who are trying to figure out which genre her music falls into. This is the legacy of straight jacketing music to suit marketing demands. Though she is influenced by multiple traditions, jazz, blues, folk etc, it is neither. This is her own unique music in her own unique voice, though the base remains very American. The other development with the ipod generation is to look at a single number and judge piecemeal. A CD presentation is a complete work of art and the whole is greater than its parts. The tempo starts slow and picks up in pace and depth, reaches a crecendo and turns mellow again. The use of the cello and pizzicato in 'Wish I could' and 'Broken' is inspired. A liberal use of the acoustic guitar, trombone and tenor sax and some great bazz builds atmosphere and timbre. Is this a trend? I see Dylan doing the same in 'Modern Times'. This is a superb album meant for the discerning listener. Fortunately, some kids are showing the way (Norah Jones, Jamie Callum, Katie Mellua). This is music that is still evolving. I am reminded of Jerry Garcia who started with the bluegrass tradition but pushed frontiers. These artists cross boundaries and break barriers and grow well beyond the traditions they started with. Norah Jones is in the process of doing the same. She shows a range, flexibility, maturity and musical knowledge and capability that augurs well for the future. This is music that will endure when rap is passe and hiphop is no longer hip.
0440238609|3.0|I agree with several of the kids' reviews that say it began great but then kind of fizzled.  I first listened to \\"The Golden Compass\\" as an audio book, and was intrigued enough to buy the boxed set.  The second book introduced a whole new cast of characters, essentially doubling the number to keep track of.  The story was seen from several different points of view, set in several locations, which did not always tie together clearly.  Throughout the second and third book, I felt as though more and more plot lines were being opened, with few being wrapped up.  In the third book in particular, the motives of antagonists seem to get all mixed up, and when the book was over, I still wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel about them.  I finished the series; I wasn't bored, but I was ready for it to be over. <br /> <br />Now for those into Christian censorship: <br /> <br />I am a faith-filled Christian who is not into censorship except in extreme cases.  This series is openly anti-Christian.  Essentially, the final books says that Christian beliefs are a mistake that worked.  I don't think the books need to be censored because of that, and my 3-star rating is not due to that (maybe 1/3 of a star was deducted because this detracted from the story for me just a little.)  But for parents who are worried about the strength of their children's faith, maybe hold off on this series for a while.  Give them Harry Potter (although some folks who haven't read them will try to say otherwise, these are moral tales about good versus evil; the characters are realistic kids who have faults and struggle to make the right decisions.)  Save these books until the kids are older. <br /> <br />
B00008LOS1|5.0|No, I'm not going to diss the \\"expanded\\" version of this album; if people really think that having the extra tracks adds something to their experience of it, who am I to rain on their parade? But give me the album in it's original form any day! It's length is perfect because it's built so well; kudos to Glyn Johns for getting Pete Townshend to pare down his \\"Lifehouse\\" masterwork to a manageable 9 songs that, track for track, stand the test of time. The opening of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" looping round and round until the band crashes into the song itself is still a thrill to hear (and, incredibly, that opening was played BY HAND throughout, it was NOT a tape loop! How the *&^% did they DO that?). From there, all the rest, \\"Bargain,\\" \\"My Wife,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" right on through to the final power chord of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\"......everything flows perfectly in what was probably The Who's best non-thematic album ever. QUADROPHENIA and TOMMY were grander concepts; THE WHO SELL OUT was a fun vehicle for some great songs; MY GENERATION, A QUICK ONE and BY NUMBERS all had their moments; the less said about WHO ARE YOU, FACE DANCES and IT'S HARD, the better; and LIVE AT LEEDS was, well, live at Leeds. But none of them had the cohesion and, ultimately, the power of WHO'S NEXT at its original length. It truly is \\"classic rock!\\"
B000002L75|5.0|The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, \\"Broken Frame\\" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and \\"Construction Time\\"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable. <br /> <br />23 years later, people can probably still identify with \\"Some Great Reward.\\" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \\"It Doesn't Matter,\\" \\"Stories of Old,\\" and \\"Somebody.\\" 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. \\"IDM\\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \\"Stories of Old,\\" possibly my favorite from the record. \\"Somebody\\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track. <br /> <br />That doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is \\"Lie to Me,\\" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with \\"Something to Do,\\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \\"People Are People.\\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen. <br /> <br />Then there's the awesome Wilder composition \\"If You Want.\\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \\"Master and Servant\\" and \\"Blasphemous Rumors.\\" \\"Master\\" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying \\"it's a lot,\\" ending it with \\"like life.\\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \\"Blasphemous Rumors,\\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track. <br /> <br />There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD/DVD version.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Nice romantic film with great cast and interesting story line that captures & keeps your attention from the get go!  <br /> <br />Sandra Bullock plays a lonely doctor, Kate Forster, looking for love and Keanu Reeves plays an architect looking for more to life than meets the eye named Alex Wyler.  <br /> <br />Each of them use to live at the same lake house, but at different time periods. They begin corresponding to each other through a series of letters..... soon it is discovered that they are living in different time periods, with Bullock's character two years ahead of Reeves' character. Both characters are lonely and form a strong connection with one another through their letters to each other and pour out each of their feelings to each other. It is interesting to see how their relationship unfolds. They vow to find a way to meet each other and it is interesting how they end up connecting with each other in the future. Lots of twists and unexpected turns take place in this film. Highly recommend watching!
B000069AUI|4.0|I recently re-acquainted myself with Coldplay's sophomore LP. I remember whenever it was first out, I felt it was one of the better things around, especially because I hated most of what was coming out when this was big. And while not on par with classic Radiohead, it is a wonderful record. Elitists generally like to laugh at people who listen to this band, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of them secretly are humming to their songs at times. Yes, the music's simple and so are the lyrics, it's not edgy and not particularly innovative. But does that mean it's never good? <br /> <br />Nope, it's got enough highlights to keep you interested. \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Clocks\\" are classic Coldplay tracks; the former with sincerity in its execution and the other one with an awesome piano hook. The title track is a melodic track about modern events, and an underrated track is the beautiful \\"Green Eyes,\\" and it makes you wonder why there weren't more acoustic type songs on the record. <br /> <br />There are a couple of kind of low-light tracks. \\"Daylight\\" is too much musically like the track before it to be interesting enough and \\"Warning Sign\\" doesn't particularly do anything for me. <br /> <br />However, the good outweighs the bad on this record. I actually like the other two albums a little bit more, but I still recommend \\"Rush.\\" You could get sick of it after awhile, I may warn you however.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|If you enjoyed Their first effort Funeral, you will adore this. It's an evolved, more mature sound but just as appealing - the same passion and  and you still feel you share a bond with the performers - it's a very personal experience listening to it. <br />  <br />The (reworking of) No Cars Go and Intervention are incredible. Other stand out tracks - Keep the Car Running, My Body is a Cage, Windowsill, Black Mirror - actually there aren't any fillers for perhaps the album title track Neon Bible. <br /> <br />Very very recommended.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I just received my copy of the Limited Edition Collector's Set this Saturday and watched it last night with my girlfriend and we both loved it.  Her only complaint was the fight scenes were a little fast for her.  Anyway, I loved the effects and just the way that the whole movie was done, it was amazing.  The fight scenes were incredible, I loved each and every scene. <br /> <br />And honestly, I don't see how people can complain about the story.  I am very new to the world of Final Fantasy, I saw the first movie, I played FFTA for GBA and I still was able to understand just about everyone and everything that was going on in the movie.  I need to go out and play the video games now, I'm hooked. <br /> <br />Anyway, I know that there are tons of reviews giving out a summary of the movie or at least the basic plot, so I'll just keep this review to my opinions.  In my opinion, this is an awesome movie, I loved all of the visual effects, I loved the characters (though I'd like to know a little bit of a background about them but I guess I need to play FF: VII). <br /> <br />On to the collectibles that come with the Limited Edition set.  The 10 postcards that come with it are masterfully done, the animation on the cards is flawless and looks amazing.  The script of the movie is pretty cool since it shows who said what in the movie and pretty much at what time that they said it on the DVD.  And finally, with the book that gives the \\"background info\\" on some of the characters, well I have yet to read it, but flipping through it, it looks like a story about each character. <br /> <br />That's just my two cents, except I'd like to say once again how much I loved this movie.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|Realism isn't everything.  Not every movie needs to be realistic. While the Fountainhead is not necessarily a classic movie, it does have its classic moments.  The drill scene comes to mind. I do think that scene itself should merit a PG rating. Can you imagine, trying to answer a childs question such as, \\"Mommy, why is the woman looking at the man with the drill like that?\\" It does have several flaws which prevents me from giving it 5 stars such as Coop's speech at the end. Cooper himself thought it should have been reshot because he was rather stilted in his delivery of it.  This, I do not blame on Cooper as, it seems to me, that any good director or producer should have realized that the scene needed some more work.  All in all, Cooper was a great actor in the Naturalistic Manner. <br />   Eveything about this movie is way over the top.  It was meant to be that way.  But you know what? It also makes you think.  I can count on one hand, the movies that make you think and to me that gives it more merit than most movies made in the last 40 years. <br />   To the critics who dislike the movie because it is unrealistic. Do these critics also think movies like Douglas Sirk's Written on the Wind are not any good? That's another movie with phallic symbolism in it. Methinks that the majority of the negative reviews regarding the film have more to do with the author's philosophy rather than the movie itself.  Whatever, you may think,the movie is memorable and it also makes you think.  Only good movies are both.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Wonderful movie! One of my 80s favorites!  Put it out on DVD already!!
B000FS9FC6|4.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is a political allegory in league with \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"1984\\" although neither as compelling nor realistic as any of those films. It reminded me most of the Ridley Scott ad for Nike that ran one time, during the 1984 Super Bowl, where a young athlete flung a hammer through a television screen featuring Big Brother.<br /><br />While hardly a masterpiece, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is certainly better and more entertaining than \\"The Island\\", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression.<br /><br />The hero is a masked character in a round hat and cape named V, a victim of a government biochemical experiment gone bad, who is out for revenge against those that did him wrong in totalitarian England. He manages to do things no one could realistically do -- control all television in England for his message, fight off a dozen armed guards at a time, etc. -- but still makes his point in a world where apparently everyone watched HDTV.<br /><br />Aside from getting even with the 10 people on his list, V sets out to lead a counterrevolution to regain democracy, or so he says; he appears in most scenes to be more despotic than democratic. The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like-minded young woman, and the government's inability to corral him.<br /><br />The characterizations in this film are all one-dimensional, almost cartoonish, but that does not detract from the involvement or enjoyment aspects of the fantasy. It's kind of like Woddy Allen's \\"Bananas\\" played straight, without the laughs. If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films I'm sure you'll enjoy \\"V for Vendetta\\".
B0007LXPBI|1.0|This remake of \\"The Parent Trap\\" is definitely not the version for little girls to watch.<br />The plot is the same at the 1961 Disney Classic starring Haley Mills, but this version contains mature themes unsuitable for little girls eyes.<br />The twins play poker at camp.<br />The looser jumps into the lake naked.<br />The villianess, Meredith grabs the father's bottom while one of the twins watches through her binoculars.<br />One of the twins and the villianess, Meredith openly discuss the subject of sex.<br />The twins mother steps out of the limo at the hotel drunk.<br />One of the twins drinks wine.<br />The butler is seen running around in his Speedo, thong swimsuit in a scene.<br />Need I say more?<br />Yes, the Haley Mills version does have some inuendoes, the bra left in the bathroom, the mother making rude comments about Vicki's \\"electric hips\\" but overall it was a decent, clean movie.<br />This movie would have been great if the mature themes had been left out. Alas this movie is yet another remake of a Disney classic, a product of tasteless twaddle of the \\"Eisner Years\\" at Disney.<br />Would Uncle Walt approve of this version?<br />I seriously doubt it.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|prior to the age of huge television screens mounted on the living room wall, a movie like this one would languish in mini-vision with horrible panning and equally horrid sound. thankfully modern systems and sound can give movies such as 'once upon the west' the true dynamic presentation they deserve. and what a movie it is.......<br /><br />the first of a leone trio (he seemed to like threes, and it's unlikely an accidental symbolism) in which he explored america (with 'fistful of dynamite' and 'once upon a time in america') and then walked away from the western genre which he had obviously, ultimately, and triumphantly perfected.<br /><br />what a doozy. from top to bottom a gem; it opens with a slow and rythmic build up which crescendos with a gunfight (and, um, three.... killed)at which point the anti-heros start to enter the stage. interestingly all are associated with an aural theme like an opera, and all seemingly motivated by different goals- but intertwined by an octopus- the railroad.<br /><br />The music is amazing- especially harmonica's theme which is just riveting at two of the more intense parts of the film; and the cast- perfect.<br /><br />the eyes. watch the eyes: henry fonda is the perfect villain; his half smile- and then the final shooting, a cold-blooded, heartless murder at the sugarwater home..... just chilling. it's the kind of acting/scene that would have typecast him a villain for his entire life had this been at the beginning- and not heading toward the twilight- of his career. leone locks on his eyes- and pivotally later on bronson's character harmonica. two killers- one for whom killing is a necessity in his lust for power; the other in his lust for revenge. jason robards is perfectly cast as cheyenne- a character thoroughly likeable though we know we shouldn't- he is a killer, after all- but who leone pulls sympathy for- because, after all, cheyenne is wrongly framed for murder- though absolutely guilty for dozens of others, we rally behind him because he's not so bad compared to fonda's.....<br /><br />claudia cardinale's jill- absolutely stunning- and base, and amoral,and wonderful all at once. is she a hero by choice, or by accident? is she really a widow- or just an opportunist? watch her closely when she says.....'mrs. we were married in new orleans.....' (i'm not convinced that the two ever were- that maybe she just acted quickly lest she become completely destitute.....) and of course- she has, um.....three potential suitors in the movie, all of three of them killers- and she's not above sleeping with the worst of them. the first time leone spotlights a female lead..... and she's everything that the male characters are.... and then some.....<br /><br />the cinematography is beautiful, from the panoramic to the close-ups, and the transfer is amazing. this is, thankfully, the uncut version. all in all, a brilliant work.<br /><br />other extras include great interviews with alex cox and john carpenter, as well as interviews with sir christopher frayling who wrote a couple of amzing critical anaylis books on leone and the italian western. great, great stuff.<br /><br />this dvd is worth the price, whatever it may be.d compared to fonda's.....      claudia cardinale's jill- absolutely stunning- and base, and amoral,and wonderful all at once. is she a hero by choice, or by accident? is she really a widow- or just an opportunist? watch her closely when she says.....'mrs. we were married in new orleans.....'

B000002OVJ|5.0|the 1995 version of this album is the one i like best. about twice as long as the original vinyl version, it contains fourteen tracks of live rock and roll, capturing this great band at the height of their powers. the deluxe edition, put out about six years later than this version, has a 2nd disc which is mostly live material from the \\"tommy\\" rock opera. if you want a live recording of \\"tommy,\\" i recommend the \\"isle of wight festival cd\\" instead. the l995 version of \\"live at leeds\\" is perfect and needs nothing added. pete townshend's power chords and guitar riffs never sounded better than they do here. keith moon's drumming is frantic and propulsive, driving things along with the big bass sound of john entwistle, and roger daltrey's voice is in as fine a form as it gets - strong, yet not overblown, phrasing these songs with style and swagger. a great presentation of one of the best live rock bands ever. this cd is a must for all rock collections.

B00000AFWZ|4.0|the 2 album vinyl release back in the 70's was a perfect garage rock compilation. this 4 cd release is not quite perfect, their is definitely some filler here that could be dispensed with, but why quibble? i am still glad the original release was expanded. much of the added material is excellent, and all of it is fun stuff from a time when garage rock was new, fresh and exciting. this box set is absolutely a must for all rock and roll collections.

B000000WG4|4.0|I first heard this in its entirity via a scratchy record from a used record store.  Scratches and all, I loved it (well most of it - I found the \\"Piltdown Man\\" annoying).  Now I can hear everything clearly. <br /> <br />Since I ordered the CD used, I'm not sure whither I got the \\"remastered\\" or simply \\"transferred to CD\\" version.  My CD sounds like the record (without the scratches).  There's no dramatic increase in dynamic range.   <br /> <br />It would have been nice to have separate tracks for each \\"movement\\", not just part 1 / part 2. It would be nice to, say, jump to the start of the   \\"introducing the instruments\\" section (which has a definite beginning) and to skip the \\"Piltdown man\\" (which has a definite beginning and end).
B000777J2S|3.0|I deeply wanted to love this album. <br /> <br />I think that Antony is one of those rare performers for whom the act of creating music is an almost spiritual experience. That is, it is an act without ego, without any kind of pretense - it is an act purely in the service of something outside of, and greater than oneself: the music. You also get this sense in the performances of Jeff Buckley and Leonard Cohen, and the better performances of Nick Cave and Tom Waits. <br /> <br />And the performances on this album are superb. They maximally express the content of each and every song. <br /> <br />The problem is, the songs just aren't that great. <br /> <br />With Buckley, Cohen, Waits and Cave, the singer is conduit to some of the greatest popular music ever written. Antony and Johnsons' songs aren't bad, but they don't have the emotional or psychological heft of the aforementioned. <br /> <br />Compare, then, Antony's performance on the Leonard Cohen tribute of 'If it be your will'. Despite the somewhat overblown instrumental arrangements, this is a transforming experience, and everything I know that this band is capable of.

B00005JOCS|3.0|I am probably in the minority on this one, but I really did not enjoy this movie at all.  I thought Beyonce was trying a little to hard to \\"NOT\\" be seen as Beyonce and Eddie Murphy was just plain silly.  I never really cared for J Foxx but I did love his performance in Ray, just not this movie.  J Hudson was superb as \\"Effie\\".  I was plesantly surprised by her overall performance. Anika Noni rose who played one of the dreamgirls has been so unfairly underrated, you would almost forget she was in the movie had you not seen it.  She was great!<br /><br />I usually enjoy musicals, especially anything to do with Motown, because I grew up listening to the likes of James Brown, Aretha, Temptations, everyday from my parents to my aunts and uncles.  It was everywhere.  That being said, I really enjoyed J Hudson's performance in this movie. I was a little worried when I heard her sing the song on the radio, because I actually did not like it at first, but when I saw the movie it changed everything.  Many people are trying to compare her version to J Holiday (the original singer of the song) \\"and i am telling you\\" but you can't compare the two at all.  There is absolutely no comparison.  Two totally different performances.  Before I wrote this review, I watched J Holiday sing it on stage at Youtube, and I must say she was amazing!! Its very rare that I tear up listening to songs but that performance was tearfully painful!!!!! Incredible!!  however, so was J Hudson's performance but in a different way!  I wish much success to Jennifer H, and look foward to her CD, but lets make no mistake here, J Holiday is the \\"And I am telling you\\" Queen, period!!!

B000002UW1|5.0|R.E.M. one of the few good bands of the '80's (along with U2 and a few others), and this is arguably the best record of the decade, not to mention easily the best thing the group ever did. This was also the group's breakthrough, containing their first Top 40 hit: The One I Love, which can best be described as Led Zeppelin filtered through The Byrds, only without each group's bad elements - none of the former's brainless lyrics or the latter's ill-advised forays into psychedelia. The One I Love happens to be their best song, with a jangly riff, simple yet cryptic lyrics (I'm with Michael Stipe's interpretation about how it's people who use others over and over, but that's just me), and a dramatic ending. Hit #2 was It's the End of the World As We Know It (and I Feel Fine) - Subterranean Homesick Blues for the information age, namechecking everyone from Lester Bangs to Lenny Bruce (Right? Right!) and featuring what may very well be the best sing-along refrain of all time. There have been several, let me add. Finest Worksong also got, and deserved plenty of attention - a straight ahead rock 'n' roller that's uncharacteristic of the group's classic sound, but rocks just the same. Some of this has been unjustly overlooked, though: King of Birds is an experiment with Indian instrumentation and rhythms that works better than most others do, calling to mind similar-sounding Beatles tracks such as Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown). Continuing in the bird thing, there's also the disquieting Disturbance at the Heron House. Plus this contains one of the group's most experimental tracks, period: Exhuming McCarthy, which works in keyboards, horns and even a vocal sample of Joseph Welch damming McCarthy. Pretty creative, and one of the best here. Strange and Fireplace (both featuring Michael Stipe's ill-advised hard-rock singer impression) don't really work out, but the rest does. It's too bad R.E.M. sold out RIGHT after this release, seeing just how good it is.

B0009VRHLK|2.0|The draw to watch this flick was Chloë Sevigny.  Interesting that she did this film after Boys Don't Cry and other big films, so she clearly wasn't needing to do graphic sex scenes.  At only an hour and a half long, this film should have been maybe 40 minutes.  Although fairly well acted and lovely, it lagged with arthouse montage and long scenic travel shots.  If a film translated into a short story, this would have been a captivating read.  The connections between the women in the film, their names, the foreshadowing...  all nice subtle suspense builders.  It was just too little  a story to be spread over a big screen.
B00003CXC6|4.0|Rashomon (Akira Kurosawa, 1950)<br /><br />It is a measure of how memorable I found Rashomon that, while watching it earlier this week, I realized roughly three-quarters of the way through that I had seen it about five years previously and utterly forgotten. (Worse, what brought the original viewing back is Machiko Kyo's vastly annoying derisive laugh about three-quarters through, a sound that grates on my nerves even worse than Julianne Moore's hideous faked cough in Safe.) That said, and taking the fact that I'd forgotten I'd seen the film before into account, it's a pretty good little flick.<br /><br />The story: A bandit accosts a man and wife on their way through the woods. The husband winds up dead. Simple, right? Well, no. Not really. The story is told from four different perspectives, and those perspectives are related secondhand through the experiences of a trio of travellers who have been thrown together by coincidence during a rainstorm. It's the unreliable narrator, but fractured and diffused to the point where no one-- including the traveller who, it has been hypothesized by some, is the actual killer-- knows what's real and what isn't. The idea here, according to most critics, is that Kurosawa was examining life and our perceptions of it-- the idea that nothing we know is true in any empirical sense, that all of it is filtered through our perceptions. True enough. And it's certainly not a bad film; it's rich, complex, well-acted (well, except for that laugh), well-directed, and fun to watch. But I'm not sure why it gets so much more attention that a number of other, more brilliant, Kurosawa films (Ikiru is the obvious contemporary choice). Enjoyable, but not Kurosawa's best. ****
B000LXH0AE|5.0|STRANGER THAN FICTION is a film about a man named Harold Crick who one day hears a posh female voice narrating his life story inside his noggin. STRANGER THAN FICTION is also about a cigarette-wielding author afflicted with a decade-long writer's block, a kid on a bike, a female bus driver, and a fateful wristwatch. The storyline gains impetus when the seemingly omniscient voice matter-of-factly states that Harold's death is imminent. This was one of the movies that got away from me during its theatrical reign. I meant to see it, but somehow never got around to it. Now, months later, before popping in the dvd, I must admit to having had a certain trepidation concerning Will Ferrell's performance. His prior goofy cinematic works gave no real indication that he could consistently pull off this serious role. The very pleasant news is that, yes, indeed, he can. As Harold Crick, you never catch him veering off character, and his effectively low key effort results in a more gratifying and a more resonant cinematic experience for his avid fans as well as the more casual onlookers.<br /><br />The cast really is very well assembled. Emma Thompson's twitchy and neurotic performance as author Karen Eiffel is complemented by her immaculately crisp and modulated, sublimely British vocal delivery, which provides the frighteningly accurate narrative voice in Harold's head. Dustin Hoffman adds a certain authority and a welcome layer of quirkiness to his role of Lit. Professor Jules Hilbert, who becomes interested in Harold's dilemma. The awesome, pixie-cute Maggie Gyllenhaal sparkles as the very sassy and independent cookie maker Ana Pascal, whose immediate on-screen chemistry with Ferrell serves to underscore the pre-Ana Pascal regimented emptiness in his life. Queen Latifah is also here, resplendent in business attire. Thankfully, very little of her rap persona shows up in her performance as Karen Eiffel's assistant. She is convincing enough in her role that, pretty soon, I stopped looking at her and thinking, \\"Hey, that's Queen Latifah!\\"<br /><br />But, despite the rest of the stellar cast and their excellent contributions, it's leading star Will Ferrell who gives STRANGER THAN FICTION its heart and soul. He has never been more engaging. He saturates his Harold Crick with an aching loneliness and a painful awkwardness (especially around Ana) that are so palpable that one immediately feels a sympathetic connection to him. Excellent job by Ferrell, who I didn't know had it in him to muster the acting chops to effectively internalize. My favorite moment has to be Harold strumming his guitar and quietly singing the Monkee's \\"I'd Go the Whole Wide World\\" with unaffected earnestness.<br /><br />The special features offer 6 comprehensive behind-the-scenes featurettes: \\"Actors in Search of a Story\\"; \\"Building the Team\\" - this breaks down the film's writing/directing/cinematic collaboration; \\"On Location in Chicago\\" - about the deliberations that went into the determining of the location (and how Chicago's architecture nicely complements Harold's inner mathematical world); \\"Words on a Page\\" - this focuses on Zach Helm, who wrote STRANGER THAN FICTION; \\"Picture a Number: the Evolution of a G.U.I.\\" - this is an informative featurette which adds even more heft to Harold's character as it reveals how the graphic designers used Graphic User Interface to illustrate the world as seen from Harold's perspective; \\"On the Set\\" - an unnecessary three minutes of quick camera shots of cast & crew.<br /><br />There's also an extended, part-improvisational scene (6 and a half minutes long) of Karen Eiffel being interviewed on the Book Channel by Darlene Sunshine (as played with dense peppiness by Kristin Chenoweth) and a 5-minute-long deleted scene of \\"author\\" Peter Allen Prothero also being interviewed by Darlene Sunshine on the Book Channel. What's missing here is an audio commentary. It would've been nice to hear comments from Ferrell, Gyllenhaal, Hoffman, andThompson.<br /><br />To me, STRANGER THAN FICTION rates four and a half stars. My only complaint about the movie - and it's a minor one - is that the ending didn't follow thru on the promise begun with the high concept premise. The outcome of Harold Crick is ultimately up to Karen Eiffell, who holds the power of God over him. Eiffell finds herself conflicted as she must choose between the perfect closing chapter for her novel versus her new affinity for her made-up character Harold Crick, who has strangely become a breathing, living person in his own right.<br /><br />STRANGER THAN FICTION is an engaging fable which convincingly argues for upending the tired conventions which sticks one in a rut. It calls for you and me to imbue each precious moment with a passion for living. Countless movies before have espoused this mantra, but few have delivered it with such delicate panache. For example, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, warm and memorable though it is and as much as I love it, chooses to hammer home its message (Capra always was unabashedly sentimental, and there's nothing wrong with that). STRANGER THAN FICTION is wonderfully bolstered by a perceptive script from Zach Helm, a great ensemble cast who breathes vivid life into the richly textured roles, and a very capable directing job by Marc Forster. On the surface, this might seem to be an unorthodox comedy, but as you go deeper into the film, while it does maintain a certain level of levity, it gradually takes on a darker and a more dramatic feel. Just go with the flow and you will reap cinematic dividends. So far, this is the best Will Ferrell I've seen in feature  films. While I do expect to bump into him most often in the realm of zany comedy, every once in a while, I'll look for him to stretch his thespian wings and expand into more challenging roles...Thompson.<br /><br />To me, STRANGER THAN FICTION rates four and a half stars.

Life is not about what it is that only we want, but how we can help others, also. Setting up the conditions for what we desire in this life is all that we can do. The truest way to look at life is to be the best individual you can be and leave the rest to Divinity.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|With less plot than a video game, and not much acting to be had, this movie's only saving grace are the special effects, but even those wouldn't warrant a second viewing.  Yawn!
B000I5X81K|5.0|This is Josh Groban's best album yet. It has some of his old style operatic ballads along with a few newer different sounds. These new sounds I'm referring to are in the songs \\"Lullaby\\" \\"Machine\\" and \\"Weeping\\". Those three are my favorites because it shows he can do more than the operatic ballads.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I won't tell you about the plot or the politics behind it because you can read that in the other reviews, I'm just discussing the movie from a mother's point of view. My daughter just turned 3, so feature length films are a new experience for her. We tried Over the Hedge which didn't capture her, nor did half the Disney films out there. Happy Feet was the first film that captured her attention from the very first minute all the way to the end. In fact, when it ended, she burst into tears and said she wanted to watch it again and she didn't want to leave. <br /> <br />I think the simple plot was definitely a benefit as was the subject matter - everyone loves penguins. The music always helps young children stay interested. What I liked about it was unlike a lot of Disney films, no one dies in the first few minutes. My friends kids who watch Nemo all love the movie, but throughout the whole film ask where's Nemo's mommy. The same for Ice Age. Happy Feet is refrshingly kid safe, however, there are 2 scenes that are a little scary when Mumble gets chased by a seal and a whale. It didn't bother my daughter, but it is there. <br /> <br />All in all, I would say this is a wonderful movie for little kids, and certainly older children will enjoy it, too.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I'm a huge fan of animation, and this movie is one of my favs now. <br /> <br />The music in it goes from the 50's to more modern sounds, great music all together. <br /> <br />The story of the lives of these penguins are amazing, starting from young and growing into there lives, just a fun and light hearted movie that is seriously great for adults and children, I smiled almost the whole way through... <br /> <br />
B00002MZ12|5.0|This is a solid release by Alanis that showcases her talent and is a pleasure to listen to.  Her cover of King of Pain is a real treat too!

1582701709|5.0|[NOTE: This was supposed to be a \\"1 star\\" review, not sure why it is rated 5 stars, but amazon won't let me change.]    If you can visualize your goals, and adopt the correct \\"attitude\\" to achieve the kind of life you seek, then the \\"secret\\" here is no book is needed to provide you the key to success.    Stated another way, this may be a good pep talk, but it is essentially saying we ALREADY HAVE THE TOOLS to achieve the life we crave. If the tools are already within our possession through attitude adjustment and visualization, what can a book possibly add to this?    Books like this, marketed like some Da Vinci Code come to life, are quite dangerous. This book charges that those with physical problems are responsible because of their mental attitudes. This is sick, and completely offensive when you consider the many filled beds in childrens hospitals.    But books like this can't be wrong; if you are not succeeding, then by definition you are not doing it correctly. Have some success? Well, congratulations, YOU GET IT!    This book is junk, and that it markets itself as some kind of \\"secret\\" carefully guarded through the ages is a mean-spirited trick on the mentally challenged. I dare anyone to show me something in this book that is not in many other books, such as \\"You don't have the luxury of a negative thought\\" which came out some 15 years ago.    I used to think that Anthony Robbins was a huckster, with his seminars that didn't offer any more insight than we avoid what is painful, and seek that which is pleasurable, but this is a new low in marketable feelgood-ism to the gullible masses. May this book rot on the shelves.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Having watched Martin Scorsese's Oscar winning film The Departed twice now, I am  ready to offer up my opinion of the film. <br /> <br />The Plot: Set in South Boston, this crime drama centers around the state police force, and its all out war on organized crime. <br /> <br />Young and somewhat troubled undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Billy is quickly gaining Costello's favor, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a hardened young criminal who has found way into the police department as an informer for the syndicate--Quickly rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. <br /> <br />Each man finds himself deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of operations he is made privy. But when it becomes clear to both the gangsters and the police that there lurks a mole, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy -- and each of the two men must now race to uncover the identity of the other, in time to save himself. <br /> <br />My Take: Based on the 2002 Japanese film, Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs), The Departed has all of the ingredients that one would expect from a Scorsese film in the mob genre. Of course, William Monahan's script gives the director plenty to work with...Does it rise to the level of perfection that is, a Goodfellas, (1990) Taxi Driver (1976) Raging Bull (1980) or Cape Fear (1991) ? The answer to that question is that the movie ultimately lands just behind all of those classics I mentioned in the great one's filmography--but miles and miles ahead of the worst, just the same. <br /> <br />Three things that really nudged at me about the flick-- taking away from an otherwise flawless film... <br /> <br />--There's a point in the film where DiCaprio and Damon's characters engage in a game of cat and mouse as they try to expose each otherwithout getting taken out...Under normal circumstances, this sequence would have been the centerpiece, made memorable through its staging and editing. I don't know what happened here, but this scene yielded, little tension or surprise. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker usually knows how to make this work but the pacing seemed off somehow. You can't have a great set-up and then blow it a crucial time in the story. I felt like I was watching a re-run of a 70's era TV cop show. I can't believe I just typed that about a Scorsese picture <br /> <br />--Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, the woman who comes between Billy and Colin, shares little chemistry with either Damon or DiCaprio. As pretty much the only female in the \\"men's room\\"...She should have sparks with someone. <br /> <br />--The Bostonian accents--Some cast members sounded really bad...and and that was really distracting. Damon, who's originally from Boston, is perhaps the worst offender. Leo fares much much better with his accent. I find it ironic though, that DiCaprio gets Oscar attention for Blood Diamond but not for The Departed--When by all account--his performance in the mob pic is better then that of BD-I digress... <br /> <br />The film succeeds though thanks to everything else. Yes, Jack Nicholson is playing a character he's done a thousand times before, but gosh darn it it works here. Also doing yeoman's work is Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and of course, Mark Wahlberg. And the ending is just spectacular... <br /> <br />The Two-Disc Special Edition DVD offers up some great extras, even though not a whole lot of the stuff, actually focuses on the film. <br /> <br />A 21-minute featurette titled \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" about Whitey Bulger, the legendary South Boston mobster on whom the film's Frank Costello was loosely based is first up. Bulger's tale is told by various folks in the know. According to this featurette, Bulger has been on the lam since 1995 and is number two on the F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted List. Interesting real-life drama. <br /> <br />The best bonus material in the DVD set is \\"Scorsese on Scorsese,\\" an hour-and-a-half documentary made for Turner Classic Movies by Richard Schickel . Scorsese talks about his life and work. Taking us through his earliest days through 2004's The Aviator ending with that TV commercial he appeared in for American Express . <br /> <br />A 24-minute featurette \\"Crossing Criminal Cultures\\" takes a look at the how the gangster film has evolved over the decades--with Scorsese at its center. <br /> <br />There is a collection of nine deleted/extended scenes--complete with intros from the director. Some of these scenes are quite good, but were rightfully omitted, for time and pace. <br /> <br />The theatrical trailer tops off the set. <br /> <br />Overall: I may have had some unexpected issues with The Departed, but none of them bothered me enough to be really critical. This is a must see movie for sure...Definitely buy or rent, depending on how much you like Scorsese
067101756X|3.0|First of all, let me state, \\"I belive...in UFOs and alien beings\\". That being said, I greatly enjoyed the first part of Corso's book; but was greatly disappointed and bored with the second half of the book. The first half of the book details the crash of the UFO at Roswell - the story of the extraterrestials that were found at the site; the autopsies of the beings; how the craft supposedly worked; the debris found at the site. All great reading for the first third/half of the book. He writes very convincingly and well that a craft really did crash. Then, the book takes a turn to describe how much of our technology was developed in part from debris found at the crash site. I'm not so sure about that.<br /><br />He describes how much of the weapons we have today (anti-missile missles, Star Wars, the circuit chip, for example) were developed by our scientists, and the armed forces based directly from alien technology. But, he also states, that we were already working on some of these items when the craft was found. Corso writes about 20 pages each to describe these developments (therefore, about 120 extra pages!). I found myself wondering what all this has to do with an alien crash at Roswell? He talks about how General MacArthur wanted to develop a moon base for the Army to protect the US against the Russians. Really? It never happened so why spend so much time writing about it. In all the books I've read about MacArthur, I never read that!<br /><br />I think the only part of Corso's book that made sense was his description of the laser and its use by the aliens regarding cattle mutilation. I have always believed that and his story made sense to me. But, to say that all of the previously described technology was finally developed as preventive weaponry against an alien attack? Hardly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was Corso's rambling about the political scenes and the infighting to get these weapons developed that lost me. I kept thinking, who cares about Nikola Tesla' youth, his writings and experiments; who cares about the development of Star Wars. I thought this book was about Roswell!Tesla' youth, his writings and experiments; who cares about the development of Star Wars. I thought this book was about Roswell! <br /> <br />

B0007GAEGC|5.0|If you like something soothing to the soul, buy this DVD and CD.  I can listen to it 24/7 and not get tired.  Their voices are like heaven's angels singing to us.  I am so happy to have received this as a gift and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves music that is soothing.  Reminds me of Enya in some ways but a different style and very enjoyable.
6301174240|5.0|I watched Moonwalker when I was a kid and loved it, I thought it was great then and I think it's great now in my 20s, you get way more violence watching Yu-Gi-Oh than with Moonwalker, plus you get to see Michael at it's best era, with videos that are probably among the best in music video history, with Smooth Criminal being a true masterpiece. Hopefully we'll see it on DVD soon, and if you can get it for your kids, do so, if not, get it for yourself. I must say that it's not a very coherent movie, it's more like pieces of different things but it's not like you're getting it for the story line.

0060589469|5.0|\\"You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other.\\"  Ahhh, such is an example of the understated writing of Mr. Pirsig.  As a long-distance motorcycle rider myself and a person who has rode motorcycles from coast-to-coast several times (and will be doing so again and again) I read this book with particular interest when it came out in the 70's and recently re-read it...and enjoyed it even more.  It's one of the few books I have read more than once in my life.  Of course the book is more a work of philosophy and the pursuit of \\"Quality\\" than about motorcycles. The story just happens to be set against the backdrop of a father and son cross-country motorcycle tour.  This is a unique and thoughtful book in the world of popular writings. I highly recommend it.  And it does not matter whether you are interested in motorcycles or not.  If you are interested in \\"life\\" you will likely enjoy this read.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Scorcese has never been known for directing pacifist stories.  The iconic director of such films as Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino and Taxi Driver shows once again that his signature of film boldly displays the most prominent aspects of old Irish or Italian American culture and all the violence, machismo and Catholic guilt that goes with it.  <br /> <br />With The Departed, Scorcese shows he is still a great director in the most traditional definition.  His style is still intact even though it incorporates modern film making and technology.  The movie is an adaptation of a Chinese crime drama called `Internal Affairs'.   I'm not sure how close they are in plot but I have to believe Scorcese has put his stamp on this one.  I have to admit, I have only seen a few Scorcese films and I believe him to be a good Director just from those examples.  He has a straight forward style that is character focused and traditional.   <br /> <br />The Departed takes place in Boston and starts with a young Colin Sullivan (eventually played by Matt Damon) being corrupted by a local Irisn Mob Boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at an early age.  He then goes on to eventually graduate from the Boston Police Academy, then joins the Mass. State Police as Costello's inside man.  Along side him is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is also enlisting in the State Police at the same time.  Billy's family history is tarnished, and Staff Sgt. Bryce Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) thoroughly trounces him for him for it, most likely testing him as Capt. Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) watches.  Billy is eventually told that they want him for a deep cover operation into Costello's mob.  He would be cut off from the police, only Dignam and Queenan would know his identity.   <br /> <br />What happens next is a dichotomy of two men working for both sides but only loyal to one.  There are many tense scenes and the performances by all actors are top notch.  No one can be singled out, everyone is at the topof their game.  From what I know about Scorcese, he draws from his own background of growing up around mobs and Catholicism.  His stories tend to center on redemption in the midst of a heavy environment of corruption.  This certainly holds true for Leo's character, who seems to be trying to atone for the sins of his family.  There are clear father-son roles as well; Costello taking on both Sullivan and Costigan as well as Queenan being a father type sanctuary role for Costigan.  Throughout the movie, Sullivan and Costigan are dealing with the truth of their own identities and the contradictions that are coming with the roles they've chosen.  Sullivan finds having a real life that includes a wife and child is exceedingly difficult as he progresses in his dept.  While Costigan wants nothing more than to get out of his situation and be his own person. <br /> <br />My only complaint for the Departed is the excessive language and the violence.  Don't get me wrong, I expect a crime drama to be rated R and to depict scenes of brutal violence and to use the F-bomb in it's dialogue.  But it overtook some quality of the movie and I became desensitized to it by the end.  The surprises that happen at the end of the movie might have had even more weight had there not already been so much.  It's truly a minor complaint for a movie that was so well acted and written though and does not deflate the rating of Five Stars.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|I'll be honest...I don't know anything about this Marvel character and didn't have a clue about his origin. (I was a DC comics kid)  But the previews for the film looked entertaining so I decided I'd give the movie a try.  What I found was a pleasant surprise!  A good story with great effects and a role that fits Nicholas Cage quite nicely.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young man named Johnny Blaze, who along with his father performed a daredevil motorcycle act at carnivals.  When his father becomes terminally ill, Johnny strikes a deal with a stranger, who turns out to be Mephistopholes (the devil) played in a deliciously evil turn by Peter Fonda.  The deal awards the elder Blaze a miraculous recovery and in return the young man's soul is given as payment in the tradeoff.  Of course, a deal with the devil is never a good thing.  Mephistopholes tells the young man that when the time comes he will return asking for a favor.<br /><br />Years down the road, Johnny Blaze as an adult is now a daredevil motocyclist with superstart status.  Enter Blackheart, the vicious son of Mephistopholes, who wants to dethrone his father as the leader of hell.  Both demons want a contract binding thousands of souls of small town that was stole by a previous \\"Ghost Rider\\" or devil's bounty hunter.  With the doomed souls of the thousand villagers, Blackheart can usurp his father's power and turn his malicious sights toward the earth as a new kingdom.<br /><br />With the aid of the the former Ghost Rider, Johnny learns about his sudden transformation (flaming skull and all!) and begins a fight between the royality of hell.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage does a nice job as the reluctant hero, who with his new found powers can see the guilt of criminals and turn the pain of their victims against them.  Sam Elliot does well in his role as the \\"retiring\\" Ghost Rider and Eva Mendes is Roxy, the girl that young Johnny left after a tragic event in his past.  Wes Bentley is very good as the dark, murderious Blackheart..he makes a good villain.<br /><br />Overall the film is an enjoyable popcorn flick that is bound to entertain.  If you are a fan of the comic book, you may feel differently---I don't know how closely the director and writers followed the character and origin of the Ghost Rider.  But for people like me, who know nothing, I think you will enjoy the film.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|`A Good Year' released in '06 is an excellent film to while away an evening with the one you love. The scenery is gorgeous, the cast superior and attractive and the plot predictable but rewarding nonetheless. Russell Crowe delivers his usual strong performance as the rich, obnoxious, self-absorbed Max Skinner, personality traits that certainly were not too much of a stretch of his acting abilities. However the real strength of the movie is found in the supporting cast; Freddie Highmore as young Max and Albert Finney as Uncle Henry (both seen in flashback sequences), lovely Marion Cotillard as romantic interest Fanny and Archie Panjabi as Max's sexy assistant Gemma to name just a few.<br /><br />One of the surprise treasures of this delightful and rewarding story and a perfect compliment to the surrounding French landscape in which it was filmed is a charming soundtrack filled with a wonderfully original and whimsical mix of French and English songs, both vintage and contemporary that will transport the listener into an intoxicating and nostalgic state of reverie.<br /><br />If you love films like `Under the Tuscan Sun' and `A Walk in the Clouds' you'll love this one too! My rating: 4 ½ Stars.
0452287022|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Read it in a couple of days.  Beautifully written.  The story is subtle yet beckons to be read so it can unravel itself to a perfect ending.  I would highly recommend it.  I felt like I was wandering the streets of Delft.  The descriptions were amazing.  Chevalier did another great job.  I also recommend The Lady and the Unicorn.
B000089QEN|5.0|This is a terrific adaptation of Thackeray's cynical novel, Vanity Fair, with the infamous beautiful, manipulative, cruel, social climbing, unscrupulous Becky Sharp as its dominant character, as we are taken through the various strata of English society.<br /><br />Natasha Little plays Becky Sharp. And, she is Becky Sharp. She gives, in my opinion, a definitive performance. For just one example, her whole demeanor, when re-encountering Lord Steyne, is simply superb, conveying Sharp's multitude of emotions, thoughts, feelings including humiliation, opportunism, hope, fear. And all the time her wheels so madly spinning. A tour-de-force performance by Little.<br /><br />The other actors are also outstanding. My only complaint is that for some reason the very ending is soft pedaled. Why, I can't imagine given the otherwise faithful adaptation.<br /><br />But even so, you'd be hard pressed to find a better adaptation. Far, far superior to the awful Mira Nair/Reese Witherspoon one.
B00082IJ08|5.0|It may sound like a gimmick, but it actually works well.  The band is Gorillaz...the members do not exist in real life.  They are animated characters hailing from Britain.  The project is really the project of a member of Blur (you know...the group that does that Song 2 Woo hoo song from sporting events).  The animated group placed together an interesting album full of steady rock beats, some rhymes, elements of electronica, and the help of some rap acts that really deserve more attention than...Young Jeezy. <br /> <br />Anyways, here's my scores on the tracks: <br />       <br />1. Intro - Not much here, 5/10 <br />2. Last Living Souls - 7.3/10, cool song, but it gets better. <br />3. Kids With Guns - 8.5/10, the beat to the song is quite good and the lyrics are simple.  The ending is the best part. <br />4. O Green World - 8.7/10, decent <br />5. Dirty Harry - 9.3/10, now comes the good stuff, the chorus is great <br />6. Feel Good Inc. - 10/10, the big attraction.  You've seen this on the ipod commercials. Great stuff. <br />7. El Manana - 9.9/10, another good song.  The real reason why I got the album. <br />8. Every Planet We Reach Is Dead - 9.4/10, an easy going song with a sad-like message. <br />9. November Has Come - 9.5/10, MF Doom...he's the man.  <br />10. All Alone - 8.7/10, the \\"All Alone\\" vocals are cool <br />11. White Light - 9.7/10, lot of people hate this song, but I think it's pretty damn cool <br />12. Dare - 8.4/10, a little on the poppish feel <br />13. Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head - 9.0/10, admire the reading of Dennis Hopper <br />14. Don't Get Lost in Heaven - 6.7/10, just a prelude into the final song <br />15. Demon Days - 8.5/10, the title track is really not my favorite, but it is a good way for the album to close out. <br /> <br />Overall, this album delivered during a time when people constantly claimed new music sucks (which isn't really true at all...stop watching MTV dude!).  If you're interested in something different, givethis album a try.  Fans of rap acts like De La Soul, MF Doom, and Roots Manuva may also enjoy this album. <br />
B000000OU6|4.0|The only problem is, a few fillers weigh the album down. <br />\\"Neither Can I\\", \\"Dime Store Rock\\", \\"Beggars and Hangers On\\" and \\"Back and Forth Again\\" are all killer tracks...
B000FVGMC4|4.0|In the day of boybands and sugar-coated pop tunes..it is so refreshing to see the new breed of singer-songwriters on the horizon. Paolo Nutini is the new gun and what a holster full of tricks does he deliver on this, his debut album. Standout track of lost love - 'Last Request' sees him pining for one more chance, whilst 'Rewind' and 'These Streets' show a vunerability only present in a nurturing artist. 'New Shoes' and 'Jenny, Don't Be Hasty' highlight his more upbeat side..A fine debut by an artist that promises to be around for a long time...

B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is not as famous as \\"Dark side of the moon\\" or \\"Wish you were here\\" but this is a must have album. <br />\\"Dogs\\" is an amazing track, with great guitars solo from David. <br />\\"Pigs\\" (Three different ones) is a great track and a memorable rythm. <br />\\"Sheep\\" is stunning with his aggressive rythm guitar and great keyboard. <br />\\"Pigs on the wing\\" one and two, should have been mixed in one track. <br />I know there is a version of it, mixed togheter with a guitar solo in between.  Far superior than the two small cuts on the album.
B00004XONN|5.0|I bought a 12\\" Macintosh PowerBook G4 in July 2005.  In so doing, my technological capacity leapt headfirst into the 21st century.  It was rather startling actually.  I went from owning and operating a 1997 Toshiba laptop what was running Windows 1998 (barely) to actually being proud of the computer that I owned.  I went from crawling around on the World Wide Web to cruising along in First Class with all possible amenities on an intercontinental flight. <br /> <br />(And yes, all clichéd Information Superhighway metaphors will cease as of now.) <br /> <br />It was an amazing feat of purchasing power, though I simply bought it used from a friend who was entering seminary.  She was upgrading to a much newer model and wanted to sell her 12-inch model, and, because she was willing to let me pay her a bit each month, I was able to help her out with her move.  And if you're interested, she's attending Regent College in the Great (Seasonally) White (and Unbelievably Picturesque) North that is Vancouver, BC, Canada. <br /> <br />I say all of that to say this: in the process of uploading all of my CD's into my new (to me) computer's iTunes, I got the chance to give a fresh listen to an album that I have long loved, but often never fully appreciated.  In my estimation, Kid A from Radiohead has to rank as one of the best, most misunderstood, and taken-for-granted albums of the past decade or so.  Most of my friends who are hardcore Radiohead fans typically cite OK Computer as their preferred album, while a decent minority are big fans of Hail to the Thief, mostly because it's the band's most guitar rock album since OK Computer. <br /> <br />Don't get them wrong - they all rather do like, love, and regularly listen to Kid A, but they feel it's too electronic, that it's not rock enough, that it's too low-key and ambient in too many places.  Those are rather appropriate responses, but, when I listen to the album in its entirety, in its proper place in chronological order of Radiohead releases, I can't help but proclaim the genius that is Kid A. <br /> <br />Let me explain more fully, or at least permit me move through the course of the album, song by song, or rather, movement by movement.  To begin, I don't think that there's another trilogy of songs as complete or as moving as the 3 opening tracks on this album.  \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" \\"Kid A,\\" and \\"National Anthem\\" are as well-crafted, flowing, and 3 parts of 1 whole as anything you might have ever heard on a progressive rock band's concept album (like Six Degrees of Separation by Dream Theater).  Thus, with these 3 songs, Thom Yorke & the boys begin their meanderings through the most guitar-less rock album probably ever recorded (and that's a compliment in my book). <br /> <br />From there, the listener hearkens upon the start of the second movement in Kid A.  Comprised of \\"How to Disappear Completely,\\" \\"Treefingers,\\" \\"Optimistic,\\" and \\"In Limbo,\\" it seems that Radiohead is attempting to redefine the components of a rock song, whether in a recorded fashion or when taking these songs on the road.  Moog-style synth sounds abound, along with well-crafted and well-played electric guitar and string arrangements that call to mind a symphony, as opposed to a rock record.   <br /> <br />Admittedly, one can easily get lost sonically and thematically within these tracks, as it sounds that there is no continuity, no rhyme or reason behind the noises or the direction of those noises.  If there is a downside to the album, it can be found amongst these 4 songs, and not because they don't fit the flow of the album, but because they do.  The average (and even above-average) rock music listener simply doesn't get this section of the album - there's no hook, no big single, and nothing to really keep you going onto the next song (unless you count the fact that the CD keeps going on the next song automatically).  I remember reading reviews and talking about this album with friends when Kid A first came out in 2000 - few people got it and those who did were Radiohead fans who were disappointed that they didn't get to listen to OK Computer 2.  And I was amongst them, but not anymore. <br /> <br />Into the last movement, probably the most recognizable: \\"Idioteque,\\" \\"Morning Bell\\" (reprised and reformatted on Amnesiac), and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\" On an album filled with string swells, organ hums, and pulsating synthesizers and Moog keyboards, these 3 songs ring true, ring deeply, and ring out loud with a dark cynicism that only songwriters like Thom Yorke can muster.  While \\"Idioteque\\" resonates with calls of a coming Ice Age, \\"Morning Bell\\" has the clarion call of a band trying to wake us up from expecting what's normal in life and normal in music.   <br /> <br />Simply put, few bands have the ability to create an album as esoteric and still as timeless as Radiohead has done with Kid A.  Why are we compelled to return again and again to this album?  Because if we didn't, Thom Yorke would scowl us to death as Johnny Greenwood turned his guitar or a seemingly random box of electronic ingredients into an instrument worthy of inclusion in the finest of European orchestras.
B00005JPG1|4.0|Gripping and at times chilling adaptation of Robert Graysmith's novel about the infamous Zodiac, his brutal killings and strange courtship with the media is director David Fincher's first return to the serial killer genre since the great Seven.  Zodiac, as many have said, feels almost like a more adult version of that film, though with the same visual flair and a sense of impreccable detail toward the case, the players and the suspects in it.  Story follows the lives of Graysmith (played excellently by Gyllenhaal), who, as a cartoonist for the S.F. Examiner, becomes obsessed with the case, leading him to a kindrid spirit in the form of an Animal Cracker eating S.F. detective played by Mark Ruffalo who shares in Graysmith's obsession in finding the real Zodiac, even years after he's slipped into footnote.  As with all stories of obsession, the characters personal and professional lives suffer to varying degrees of effectiveness.  Robert Downey Jr. who plays an addled, hot-shot journalist sees his career deadened by drugs and alcohol in the Zodiac's mythic wake.  The movie doesn't feel it's over two and a half hour running length thanks to the twists and turns in the plot and the suspects the plot proffers for the viewer's own inspection.  The film offers no answers and leaves the the killer's identity up to the viewer.  As anyone who's followed the case at any length will know, the killer was never fingered, nor brought to justice and the main and only suspect is now dead.  Smartly, the story never wallows in grusesome kills (though there are several), but rather depicts the lives of those affected by investigating the case, who, many years later, still live with those ghosts.
B000002C1W|4.0|This is the first and the best of the Floyd without Roger Waters. <br />\\"Sign of life\\" is mysterious, \\"Learning to fly\\" is a good song. <br />\\"Dogs of war\\" is innovative. \\"One slip\\" is a bit more a song for a Gilmour solo album. \\"On the turning away\\" is a classic Floyd song. <br />\\"Yet another movie\\" is very good. \\"A new machine\\" is an outro the the previous track. \\"Terminal Frost\\" is a real gem, I love this instrumental. <br />\\"Sorrow\\" is full of rythm and great guitar solo.  A very good cd, a bit different from classic Floyd, but still good to my ears.
B000VK7KVQ|2.0|Before i give my review, I must say that I do like David Fincher's other movies because of his unique style.  This movie does have a unique camera work and color so visually it is very interesting.  Unfortunately, the movie's story is very dull.<br /><br />The beginning is very quickly paced and at first felt like this movie could be like \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"  The murder scenes can be very scary as you dont know what is going to happen.  The investigation of the crime scene were great and very interesting how the police do their jobs.  Unfortunately, once the murder scenes stop at about an hour in, the movie focuses on the investigations and unless you are a detective yourself, can find it very boring watching someone else piece together a puzzle with no resolution.<br /><br />Its a shame cause the acting is great and the characters have their own uniqueness to each other.  Its just that the movie is too long, the mystery is still a mystery, no resolution, and i was just left with a unsureness whether this could have been better.  I never read the book, but it probably should have been left as a book, because as a movie, it doesnt work too well to entertain.
1592401791|4.0|Having briefly worked at Abbey Road Studios, I can attest to Geoff Emerick's description of the place.  I was there to record an album for the band \\"America\\" in 1982 and spent 3 weeks in the infamous studio 2.  I can understand why the Beatles grew to hate the place after just a few years.  While the technical aspects of the studio were superb, the room itself was very 'cold' and industrial looking.  The lighting was all flourescent and factory-like.  When the Beatles requested 'mood lighting' they were given red flourescent lights mounted vertically on big mic stands.  Those were still in the studio when I was there.  Access to the control room from the studio was by a stairway only, and a dozen or so trips up and down those would wear you out.  Being a huge Beatles fan, I had to have this book.  But being a recording engineer myself, I was a little disappointed at the lack of tech-info provided by Mr. Emerick relative to the equipment used.  I would have loved to know what and which brand and type of mics were used, and the different types of outboard gear as well.  It might be interesting to note that I was an \\"outside\\" engineer at Abbey, something that was forbidden there not too many years before.  A darker side of the four Beatles is revealed here that may be disappointing to some who remember them as the fresh-faced innocent Liverpool lads.  Emerick describes Lennon as the worst to deal with, and Paul the best.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Having grown up in the 80's when metal was pretty popular I became a big fan of JP. I don't buy too much music anymore, partially because I have issues with the RIAA criminals, as well as there just isn't much new stuff I like.<br /><br />Any way this is some great stuff by JP, I kinda had doubts Rob could still sing so well, but he proved me wrong. I pretty much like all the songs, which is rare. Any priest fan should be pleased.<br /><br />One bad thing about this \\"dual disc\\" is I was unable to even read the CD side of the disc on either of my computers (3 cd drives total). Which bummed me out as I wanted to copy to my Sansa player. So what I did was extract the music on my PS3, then copied it to a USB drive and back to a computer where I could copy it over to my Sansa.
0553383663|3.0|This book chronicles the rise of Google - from the labs of Stanford University to the multi billion dollar behemoth it is today. The authors have written the book in a breezy way - you don't find much technical information nor do you learn anything private about the company. Although Google has given us some very good software and search, this book does hype up Google at every little opportunity. But it is still fascinating to read about some very intelligent people like Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and how they grew the company. As Google keeps growing and dominates more and more, it would be interesting to see the public reaction towards it. Will Google still be the people's darling or would it go the Microsoft way?
B00008WT5E|5.0|>>>>>>>>>>If you're looking for a cd, not necessarily the best in the band's catalogue, but one that you can pop in the cd player at almost any given time and still enjoy it, then here it is! \\"Powerage\\" not only captures AC/DC in their prime, but it also showcases some of Angus' catchiest and most complex guitar work (both in his soloing and in his riffs), some of Malcolm's best rhythm guitar duties, and of course, all Bon has to offer, because that's all he ever gives to his fans. While not as popular as other AC/DC classics such as \\"Highway to Hell\\" or \\"Black in Black\\", it still is probably my third favorite album from the \\"Thunder from Down-Under.\\" This cd just has IT. I don't know quite exactly what IT is, but IT got me hooked in right away, gave me countless and memorable listening experiences, and still gives me enjoyment to this day. In reality, it's so hard to describe, I don't know where to start.<br /><br />  *************Take the new and fresh gem that is the track \\"What's Next to the Moon\\"; the gang-vocals on the last couple of verses, the new and creative tom-beat from Rudd, or the nice, simple riff delivered by our favorite schoolboy. Take the classic \\"Sin City\\" (my personal favorite on Powerage), with the creative bass-guitar interlude and simply delicious solo from Angus (my fav on the cd), the live-friendly hits \\"Riff Raff\\" or \\"Rock n Roll Damnation\\" both containing vintage-AC/DC riffs, catchy chorus', and Angus' trademark solos, or the underrated and memorable \\"Downpayment Blues\\" and \\"Gimme' a Bullet\\" both amazing songs with creativity and freshness shroudding their glory. And those are only a few of the goods. The WHOLE album is full of nine great rockers, not one of them being bad. In short, \\"Powerage\\" is literally a flawless recording, production-wise...in musicianship... in the whole attitide and atmosphere of the cd really.<br /><br /> -So, if you want an album that won't displease you, won't leave you scratching your head in dissapointment (asking yourself where the band went wrong), but that will leave you with appreciative ears and a black-toothed grin on your face, for God's sake get this classic!apointment (asking yourself where the band went wrong), but that will leave you with appreciative ears and a black-toothed grin on your face, for God's sake get this classic!
8489367116|2.0|I enjoyed reading about the narrator's experience of Bombay.  The numerous vignettes involving the uniqueness of India were absorbing, and some characters were well developed.  However, the heavily lengthy philosophical deluges wore me down.  This author should stick with the story line and quit trying to prove how redeemable he is as a thinker.  The guy's a seedy criminal and it's his absorption into the seedier seams of Bombay that are fascinating in this novel.  Cutting out most of the \\"thinking\\" would have reduced the volume by half without, in my opinion, losing anything important.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|While not significantly different from her previous two releases, An Ancient Muse is just as good and will sweep you away into her lush world. The Middle Eastern rhythms and traditional Celtic tunes take you on a musical journey through the world of the Celts. Put it on repeat, light some candles, and go on the journey with her. <br /> <br />The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it contains DRM that prevents you from loading it into iTunes and taking it with you. I believe that if you buy music, you should be able to do what you want with it as long as you are not giving it away to someone who would otherwise have bought it.
1594200106|5.0|After finishing &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; by Carlos Ruiz Zafon it is difficult for me to stop thinking about it.  Rarely do I read a book that can be a well written literary work and a page turner at the same time.  The Shadow of the Wind is one of those novels where Zafon has crafted an enchanting story while paying tribute to his hometown, Barcelona.  He describes the city and its mysterious environment with such beautiful detail.  Zafon's world feels magical, yet realistic told in a tale profoundly expressed through themes we suffer from everyday including heartbreaking romance, internal revenge, and dealing with the loss of a loved one. The Shadow of the Wind connects all of these themes by the power literature has on us.<br /><br />  The novel's hero is young Daniel Sempere who suffers from not being able to remember the death of his mother.  One day his father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books where he finds a book called &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; by Julian Carax.  After falling in love with the book Daniel becomes obsessed with discovering who the mysterious Julian Carax is and what happened to him.  As Daniel digs deep into Carax's past he discovers one of Barcelona's most disturbing secrets and at the same time his own drifting innocence.  Zafon creates a unique and moving tale with Daniel and Julian, where the young book reader begins to realize that his own life is paralleling the author he has grown to admire.  Here the novel reveals a great tragedy that becomes a horror to read and Zafon handles it delicately between Daniel and Julian concerning broken friendship, forbidden love, and a malicious evil with a history that plans to join their destinies.<br /><br />  &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; is a real pleasure to read from its fast paced mystery to its wonderfully drawn characters including Daniel, his lovable retired secret agent sidekick Fermin Romero De Torres, his love interests, Bea Aguilar and Clara Barcelo. I enjoyed how Zafon weaved his romances into the story, developing Daniel's struggles with growing up between the two women he has affection for.  He is nine years old when he falls for Clara, the gorgeous blind niece of the bookseller Gustavo whom he visits her to read to.  It felt so true to life when Daniel learns how foolish his crush is when he witnesses Clara's affair with another man. His second love is when he is seventeen and has become a mature young man as he grows more intimate with Bea Aguilar who is his best friend's sister.  Through the time he spends with Bea, Daniel learns what it means to fall in love in someone.  In the end the novel is a moving story about love between two men, Daniel and Julian who venture through their own darkness to give each other the strong measure of peace they desire and hope to achieve.<br /><br />  Zafon handles every sub plot well in this book including the adventure Daniel must embark on to discover Julian and himself turning the story into a well crafted epic. From the moment Daniel discovers The Shadow of the Wind in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books to the climax with Julian Carax's adversary Inspector Franciso Javier Fumero, the story is a rare wonder. I will not spoil anymore for you beyond that Inspector Fumero is one of the most evil villains you will ever read in fiction.  For those of you readers who want to read a stand alone tale &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; is a single novel that brings every character and sub story to a fulfilling end.  It is a book that everyone should give chance if you love to read; a beautifully woven story of adventure, romance, friendship, family, death, and spiritual redemption.  Zafon has written a wonderful story that has something for everyone while faithful to the message that literature is powerful and can affect our perception of the world whether its through our eyes or the author's.  This is one of those books that can turn a person who despises reading into a devoted bibliophile.Gorgeous from start to finish and one of my favorites next to &#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; by Larry McMurtry and &#34;The House of the Scorpion&#34; by Nancy Farmer.m start to finish and one of my favorites next to &#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; by Larry McMurtry and &#34;The House of the Scorpion&#34; by Nancy Farmer.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|I just finished watching this for the first time. In many ways, this movie is a traditional action flick. But I see why it's considered such a masterpiece: it has a very poignant, tragic subtext. Kurasawa seems to say that the samurai are actually outsiders in society despite their exalted status. The farmers--and everyone else--only care about them when they are in danger, but as soon as the bandits are gone, don't let the door hit you on the way out. This is symbolized beautifully when Shino turns her back on what's-his-face. (Hey--I only saw it once and these Japanese names are tough).  <br /> <br />A lesser filmaker would have never done this. The samurai would have been carried on the farmer's arms in victory and he would have won the girl. But this movie reminds us that samurais were just lonely mercenaries without a home and the farmers they saved have already moved on with their lives.   <br /> <br />
B00009W0U4|4.0|The single shot camera action in the beginning is a bit nauseating, but it adds to the affect of the storyline very well.  Simply done and well acted.  This one's worth seeing just figuring out the story.  Graphically realistic situation that can happen to anyone.
0740748475|5.0|For a little over ten years (less a couple of sabbaticals), nothing brightened up a gloomy workday morning like the day's \\"Calvin & Hobbes.\\" Sophisticated and hilarious, deeply ironic and richly human; even at the time it was something special. There has been nothing quite like it before, and certainly not since.<br /><br />This three volume set has all of the 3,160 cartoons. Consider that the cartoon format was never intended to be collected and read as a book. It's a daily cartoon, written on deadline, and over the course of ten years you'd expect moments of laziness to creep in. You'd expect that there would be inconsistencies and redundancies. Amazingly, there are not. Watterson deserves high praise for that alone.<br /><br />But most of the praise should be for the richness and depth of this daily cartoon. Walt Kelly's \\"Pogo\\" and Trudeau's \\"Doonesbury\\" offer richness and depth, but not through the eyes of a smart-aleck six year old kid. And Kelly and Trudeau offer precious few laughs. Calvin & Hobbes offers serious philosophy, literary criticism, art theory and criticism, and unbelievable creativity. Watterson moved far beyond the duality of Hobbes, the anthropomorphic tiger/plush toy. Less skilled and creative cartoonists are still running their cartoons on lesser gags.<br /><br />So here's to Spaceman Spiff, Tracer Bullet, hordes of deranged snowmen and the memory of a time when the comics were a lot more entertaining. My very highest recommendation.

This movie has taught people who has drinking and drugs problems!!
0743454537|3.0|I had been wanting to read My Sister's Keeper for quite some time now. I had heard good things about it and It's been on my book list for about a year. I, finally ordered it and I had such high hopes for this book. I was really excited to start right in. I was expecting something a little different from what the book turned out to be but, I was really enjoying it anyhow. The book is fast paced and even though it's a very emotional topic I found it easy to read. I loved Jodi Picoult's writing style it was really fantastic. I'm a very heavy reader. I love reading and I've read one too many books to try and guess how many. And, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is the first book I've ever read that I've gotten emotional about. I really connected with the characters and found myself rooting for Anna and getting mad at others. I mean I really almost looked at them as living human beings.  <br /> <br />The book was a wonderful touching novel and I loved every page of it.  <br /> <br />.... Until The Ending. I didn't not see it coming. I mean a lot of times I can guess what happens in the end of a book but, in My Sister's Keeper I was blingsighted. I was shocked at how Jodi Picoult ended the book. It was so abrupt and then the book was over. Through the whole book You really get to know the characters and watch them develop, but when the ending came I didn't feel like the book had any closure. I really, really, really cannot stand the ending. And when I say it's the first book I've ever gotten emotional about I mean it. After I finished reading the last page. I cried. I don't understand why she chose the ending she did. But, it seems to me like an ending that would happen in real life.  <br /> <br />GREAT BOOK! Until the Ending. The ending ruined all the good things the book had for me.

B000KCHZK6|2.0|I couldn't agree more with the preceding two star reviewers.  I was expecting so much more than this monotonous, quite frankly, boring album.  There's really nothing to sink your teenth into.  A couple of the songs at the end have some promise, but as a whole the album falls flat, lacking emotion or depth or variety.  Her voice does sound good, but there seems to be some disconnect, as if she sleptwalked through it.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|The original version of Luc Besson's first American film was blazing with firefight action, the creepy stylings of Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the ingenuous flirtation of a young Natalie Portman, an excellent matter-of-fact view of 'the really real world', and a hint of a suggestion of an allusion to the very real romantic entanglement of a 13 year old orphan and a 40 year old hit man. This version actually deals with the relationship between Mathilda and Leon, contextualizes it with his history (and immigration catalyst) and the realistic and legitimate development of their relationship through the juxtaposition of their respectively damaged mental, physical and emotional states of maturity. Further, it deals with their professional relationship as well as making sense out of the abrupt hints that define Tony and Mathilda's dealings with one another. For those who 'got it' in the original, this fleshes out all of the details you were forced to fabricate and or assume; for those that didn't, this is what the film was meant to be. Send your copy of the theatrical release back to the studio with a nasty letter about artistic integrity and scrotal stalwartness and pick up a copy of the real film today.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|Don't buy this album if you're expecting more songs similar to Crazy.  I can't understand how you can be so good and so bad at the same time.  This is a perfect example of why you listen to an album before you buy it.  What a waste of talent.  I look forward to good things to come, however.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Ive been a PT fan since Lightbulb Sun, when they were the opening act for the Dream Theater Tour. I actually saw them live at San Francisco in a moderate venue during the in Absentia summer tour, before the CD was actually released.  Therefore i was glad Blackest Eyes, The Sound of Muzak and Buying New Soul were included in this DVD, since these songs were played that time. I must say the fact that Deadwing was not included was a bummer for me, wouldve liked that fabulous bassline thumping the hell out of my subwoofer. However this DVD captures how great the band is live, and the sound mix is phenomenal, theres no closer thing to what they sound like live. Other great songs are The start of something beautiful, trains (clams included), and the non-album tracks, so called friend and mother and child divided.  In conclusion: GET THIS & PLAY IT LOUD, and when you do, tell your friends to come over and enjoy, they wont be dissappointed.
B00005JPG1|5.0|The main complaint I've heard about 'Zodiac' is that it is too long. Honestly, it didn't feel that long to me, and at a few points, I was looking at my watch counting the minutes until it ended not because I was bored and ready to leave, but because I was so engrossed in the story that I wanted it to be longer. The movie probably feels long because the murder scenes are all taken care of in the first twenty minutes. I have read Robert Graysmith's book about the Zodiac killings, and so I knew that murder scenes would not pervade the movie. However, people who have not read Graysmith's book probably expected the murders to continue as such throughout the movie. That means they were probably waiting for another murder scene, which never comes. Fincher seems to know that, for a serial killer movie, it is relatively violence-free, and compensates for the lack of crime scenes by staging some incredibly intense sequences.    But in doing this, Fincher makes a slight error. The movie is so factual that it appears Fincher may have researched where people sat at a bar on a certain night. Because of the factual tone of the movie, all the murders take place outside the actual story, at the very beginning. As a result, the murders are forgotten about by the middle of the movie, and casual references made to crime scenes (\\"That couple that was gunned down in Vallejo last Christmas\\" and \\"The girl shot out at the golf course\\") make little to no sense, especially considering that the Christmas murder is not shown in the film. But this is a very minor mistake, one that, by the end of the movie, is pretty much overlooked.    The book of the same name, on which the movie is based, is slightly more detailed than the movie. But honestly, what can you expect? It's a 160 minute movie versus a 300-plus page book. I didn't go into the movie expecting it to be as detailed as the book, but there is a very slight problem with the details in the movie. In the book, the Zodiac's last letter is avery dramatic turning point. It had been nearly three years since the Zodiac had written the San Francisco Chronicle, and when he did, the letter was basically a review of the movie 'The Excorcist.' The hook to the letter is that the movie was playing at only one place in San Francisco: the Northpoint. The letter did not boast of murders or planned attacks like his previous ones, but it was chilling nontheless because it pinpointed where the killer was for two hours at some point in the last week. Another part in the book that is not in the movie is a mention of a cheesy 1971 movie about the Zodiac that played for a week in a San Francisco theater and was seen by less than a thousand people. Authorities set up a prize drawing at the theater that they hoped the real killer would enter because he was such an egotist, and it was also a given that he would see the movie. While it is not confirmed that he ever did go to see the movie, but author Robert Graysmith adds in his book \\"the film ends with the implication that the killer may be sitting behind you...and he could have been!\\" These interesting little information tid-bits are compromised in the movie, and replaced by scenes that are repeated, and scenes that didn't need to be in the movie. One prime example is a scene where Jake Gyllenhaal's character (who plays Graysmith) collects information on the case with his two children. One of the repeated scenes is one seen in the preview, the one where Gyllenhaal recieves an anonymous, breathy phone call, supposedly from the Zodiac himself. The first scene depicting this is eerie and suspensful, but the second and third time it happens it's repetitive and boring. Another scene that could have been scrapped is a scene between Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.'s character (Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, a once prominent Chronicle reporter who covered the case, was threatened by the killer, pursued the case as if he was a cop, developed a cocaine addiction, and eventually succame to his alcoholism and coke addiction) where Gyllenhaal goes to visit a down-and-out Downey on his house boat. The scene consists, mainly, of the two of them discussing the video game Pong, while the theme music plays loudly in the background. Don't get me wrong, these are all great scenes (with the exception of the brief, five second phone call ones). The acting is great and the cinematography and lighting is fantastic. But it's still ten to fifteen minutes of unneeded material that could have been replaced by one of the many interesting mysteries of the case.
