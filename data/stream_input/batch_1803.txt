B008AK8FHM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Incredibly detailed event of life after death.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone that is spiritual.
B000ICXQS8|2.0|This was my first time seeing the movie and I found that it did not live up to the hype.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|This is going to make a great Christmas gift! I am glad to have this movie on Blue Ray.<br />I had it on VHS. LOL!
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|A classic from Tarantino! I love this film. An interesting story, sword fights, campy dark humor, ninja fights, japananime...what's not to like?
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is where Parker and Stone either make up for things like 'Orgazmo' or apply what they have learned. If you are familiar with the old British show The Thunderbirds, you like this even more. Filmed in Supermarionation! Brilliant and funny.
B002K9C0Q6|4.0|The orchestra played this to a tee with me listening all the way through.  Intimidating Symphony No. 9 with brash clear sound!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|Let's hope for more of this. The old Herge comic strip from Belgium, popular since the 50's, redone and in such a way that the old charm and quality survives. If you love adventure, you love this, regardless your age.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Exactly as described and worth the price, great deal for the series, will make a great christmas gift this year
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is great exercise for the mind, no doubt, but there are a lot of puzzle games on the market.  This adds an elegance and tactile experience unlike any I've ever seen/felt.<br /><br />I'm playing this on a Kindle Fire HD, and love the way the graphics flow as my finger glides across the screen.  Think silk.  The unity of touch and visual - and a simplicity- is something special.<br /><br />To the developers-- congrats on aiming high and hitting the mark.  To anyone else reading this-- try it and you'll love it.  (Just be sure you've no place else you need to rush off to)
B000SZK41M|5.0|Just been one of my fav's. I like most of Bruce willis movies just wish he didn't use so such profanity.
B00742GBDM|1.0|I found it so disappointing to find this movie called Mansfield Park and its total disregard of Jane Austen's book. Any resemblance to the novel is by accident. It grossly misrepresents Sir Bertram and presents a Fanny with a personality almost one hundred eighty degrees different that the Fanny of the book. What a disappointment and misrepresentation of Jane Austen's writing!!!!!!
B005A68HRC|5.0|Every song on this CD is great.  The lyrics are more than just a few lines repeated over and over.  They actually change and tell stories.  The tunes are catchy and upbeat.
B00973902K|5.0|I like country music. This is one of the favoriate song I listened over the radio. Bought to show my support.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Movie stays true to the book.  I had hestiated to read the book because of the concept of kids fighting to the death, but several friends convinced me to try it.  So glad I did.  Like the book, the movie portrays the horror of the arena scenes without being overly gruesome.  The movie soundtrack is also amazing.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|My son plans on doing this trail. I wanted to learn more about it. Book was very descriptive. Now I am even more series.
B008Y7IFSA|5.0|I needed a copy of Muppet Christmas Carol in a pinch for a party and it worked great and was a high quality picture. There's nothing like the Muppets in HD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is definitely one of my most favorite books of all times. After reading it, it changed my perspective on everything. Truly an amazing book.
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|Mila Kicks and pulls off anothe great movie!<br />I have never been dissapointed with any movie in this series.<br />I hope they make manny more!
1606995359|5.0|I'm from the Netherlands so I got all stories in dutch, but I always wanted to read them in Barks' own language. And indeed, I love it!
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|The movie , Just plain rocks!<br />I can't believe more people don't consider this a master piece.<br />I just loved it!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|There was nothing particularly striking in this one. I kind of wish I'd waited for the bargain bin. but it was a decent sick day read.<br />I was surprised by the bad guy (who shows up at the manner you would expect if you have read any Cornwell. I didn't figure him out but I also didn't remember who it was from earlier in the book and had to figure it out through later context. In a way it was a pleasant change from figuring it out right away and wanting to throttle characters for missing obvious stuff.<br />Nothing about it enthralled me but it was readable enough. Wait til you find it at half price books or the thrift. Store though.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is one of the better books I've read lately, and I'm surprised to be saying that. But I can't think of any 'sour notes' in the entire 5 book set. I almost quit in the very first pages when I realized I had accidentally bought a science fiction or fantasy book. But I liked the author's style and wanted to see where he went with this story; I'm so glad I stuck with it. &#34;Wool&#34; is actually science fiction, not fantasy with dragons or vampires! I recommend this story for the realistic characters, even better narrative--especially the unobtrusive way Mr. Howey draws us into the world these people occupy. I will be following this author.
B004SIP88Y|2.0|Too many wire act acts and way too may big blowing fans.<br />Did not care for the phony action in film.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book has to be one of my favorite books now. I laughed, I cried and I learned so very much. I love books with so much history. Anyone interested in history of the  holistic should read this book. But is is heart breaking bring a box of tissue
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I love this concert footage because it's what the audience saw on the video screens at the actual concert. Fantastic. None of your typical MJ video with lots of crowd shots of girls screaming. He seemed to love that. Not me, I want to see the performance! This is MJ at his best, looking good, sounding great.
B00884GR0W|3.0|it is one of the best games i have ever played, but it totally destroyed everything i had. there should be a reset setting changes button, so i can set back everything i had changed. instead, IT WIPED THE GAME!!!!
B0084I9QFU|5.0|Inlove this because Bad is my favorite MJ album. The songs sound better than they did on my old cd so I'm happy!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|The first part in a two part concept double release with the second part coming next year. The house of Gold & Bones part 1 is a great new album with mostly aggressive songs and an interesting concept behind it. After there previous album Audio Secrecy was although a good album a bit to heavy on the ballad and mid tempo song range for some. This album should please those looking for something more Hard Rock/ Heavy Metal style though not devoid of softer stuff it is in the minority and it fits the back story that comes with it. I would recommend getting the CD version as the jump in sound quality is definitely noticeably and worth it and it also comes with the story the Taylor wrote that the albums music is based on. Not  sure if that is the case for the MP3 version.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|Most novels are better than the movies made from them. But none of the movies made from this novel come anywhere near how well constructed this novel.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is a magnificent product, beautiful packaging and the box art looks phenomenal. The quality of all the movies look amazing and the sound quality is simply outstanding. The price was great as well. I got this amazing set for $35.00, which it was great. Over all it was a great product for an outstanding price. Thanks Amazon for this great deal.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie was alright but nothing great.  Kinda predictable and not too realistic.  But worth watching once i suppose. :)
B003L77GGA|5.0|Whole family gathered over a few weeks to watch it. A fitting conclusion to a great series. Only shame is that it's all over now :(
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great Movie.  Best of the Trilogy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  We didn't see it in the theaters because we have a small child, but we loved watching it at home.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is a great show! Will fight anyone who disagrees!! =D<br />I've seen the previous 7 seasons straight and every time I watch an episode is like my day has been made!! You wanna laugh, disconnect from reality for a bit? Watch this show and just enjoy watching Barney being awesome and Ted being sensitive, Lily being creepy, Marshal being innocent, and Robin just being Robin, don't need to say more :P
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ok I know this has nothing to do with the game but why cant I find subway surfer? every time I try to find it in the appstore It takes me to this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|what do you write about a calculator..I downloaded this app on my kindle fire.. it does exactly what it suppose to do.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This musical is lavish, with spectacular sets, costumes and the extraordinary music of Andrew Lloyd Weber. The fade-out between the past and present is beautifully accomplished and the voices are gorgeous. This one is a keeper and well worth seeing many times.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire and it does exactly what it says it will do. What the heck was I thinking? Do I really want to know the time in China right now? I barely can keep up with the time in my present state.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I have watched this movie many times, not just at Christmas, but whenever I need a lift and a laugh. The stellar cast is perfect and the characters are woven into the story because they all know or have contact with each other throughout. It is a very clever plot and so amusing, tender and heart-warming. There are a few scenes and some language that may be r-rated for some but I thought it was adorable. The music is great throughout the movie!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Its just all the rage! Love it..the whole series. Cant wait to see the continuing movie. Glad I read the series before watching the first movie. It made better sense.
B0077PBPY6|4.0|Lovely, charming story, although long war scenes. The main characters are lovely to watch, especially Eddie Redmayne, who is also in &#34;My Week with Marilyn.&#34;  This is a beautiful period piece.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Should be punished for not having this great cd when it first came out. Where was my head, no response needed....
B0013Z5B50|5.0|I loved the performances in this lovely movie, as there was intense chemistry between all three of the main characters. There was also a lot of action and daring scenes, especially for Richard Gere, as Lancelot. A perfect cast made this one a favorite of mine.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Gave it 5 stars for the simple fact that liam neeson's character did something extremly unexpected in one scene involving a former friend turned bad and his innocent wife.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|I received this snail toy at a shower, and ever since my son was a month or so old he couldn't take his eyes off it when he was on his playmat. Now that he is a little older, he will turn on his side just to be able to touch the snail.<br /><br />I love how sensitive the toy is to touch, so all my son has to do it barly graze it and the snails face lights up and he makes noise. The only draw back to this is that it sometimes goes off by itself when you are walking on the carpet 5 yards away.<br /><br />The mirror is also at the perfect height for him to see his own face in and it makes him smile and try to grab the baby in the mirror. Since discovering this toy I have already given it as a gift to a couple of my friends that are expecting!
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|Great sound.  I am glad I picked this up to complete my audio library at a great price...one of Amazon's sales.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Again, very good service. I still need a couple more parts to get my next pc running.<br />The best price I have seen.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Great sound.  I am glad I picked this up to complete my audio library at a great price...one of Amazon's sales.
1419705849|5.0|Book I ordered got here sooner than I anticipated and I was happy about that. Book looks brand new like I went to a book store and picked it up.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Bought as a gift.  Amazing show.  I think they will love it.  Next year I can buy them season 2!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very fun to play! Love playing on touch screen vs computer. Easy to see on my kindle fire HD. Lots of fun shapes.
B00177E1Z0|5.0|Great sound.  I am glad I picked this up to complete my audio library at a great price...one of Amazon's sales.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|As others have said; \\"When Love is Gone\\" is missing from the film. Therefore you're paying for an incomplete film. I bought the Blu-Ray so I could, at least, watch in in HD but I'm very disappointed. The quality of the film otherwise is quite good. Not a great Blu-Ray transfer but better than the old DVD releases.
B00378VGGO|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorites, and this was a cheap and easy way of watching it while I'm at school. For an online movie the quality is very good and it doesn't lag or pause in a weird way when I'm trying to watch :)
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Well written and directed. Well cast. All the characters were fun and believable. A must see just to tell people that this movie is NOT a documentary or a NATGEO special.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I had pretty well given up on Baldacci. His last few books had bored me- some I didnt even finish. I picked up this book on CD at Cracker Barrel for a long drive and was blown away. Baldacci is back with a strong character, with an interesting back story.<br /><br />Plot- strong, with a good build up through the book. Was a little disappointed in how he wrapped it up. The eventual villains were a little unbelievable. Cant say too much here without spoiling it.<br /><br />Dialogue- the best Baldacci has ever done. He took a writing class or something, because the dialogue in this book is head and shoulders above anything else he has written.<br /><br />Characters- only one worth discussing- John Puller takes the lone soldier mythos to a new level. If you like this genre, which has been dominated by Lee Child's Reacher character, you will love John Puller. A charismatic creation you hope Baldacci will bring back many more times.<br /><br />Two minor beefs. One,the conclusion was cheesy and seemed like Baldacci had just run out of ideas. Two, subplots (never a Baldacci strong suit) were not particularly compelling.<br /><br />Basically an outstanding story and a refreshing change of direction for a worn-out author. Baldacci ha me back with John Puller.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.<br /><br />If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Truly one of the best books I've read in a long time!  It's intelligent and thought provoking.  I have highly recommended it among friends!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love the challenge. kill time when waiting at the. doctor office. great for on the go and goof for the brain and thinking skill.
0345803493|5.0|All three books were definitely page turners.  I was totally enthralled!!  I read at every opportunity I received. i would definitely recommend.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show, good drama and not just Zombie bashing. The effects are so life like some times I forget it is not real.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game is ok, but its so far deleted my game 2 times! WHAT THE F#$%! I will complain if this occurs again.
0593070631|5.0|Firstly, I chose to buy this product because I´m a Mcfly fan. I liked everything about it and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Mcfly.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|fifty shades freed stupid was sorry I spent the money for this one stikk waiting for some good action but was still disapointed
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I enjoyed this movie so much more when Kristen was not on the screen.  The dwarfs are hilarious.  Could have been a cult classic.  Stewart plays snow white and she is supposed to have a strong heart, but she (and her acting) is weak!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|mockingjay  great book loved it kept my attention hope they don't mess up this book in the movie  I am hoping that she will demand more of what is in the book to be in the movie
B007BVOEPI|5.0|They did a great job of staying with the storyline from the books and they did a beautiful job of bringing it to life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|fifty shades of grey  boring kept waiting for some thing to happen other than spankings was very disappointed glad they are done wont watch movie
0307405095|5.0|I looked at many pie books before purchasing this one.  Martha's book is nicely done, with beautiful pictures for every recipe.  I like that her crust recipes are made with butter and not shortening.  Also, the recipes are easy to follow and there is a useful guide in the back with tips ranging from what to buy, how to decorate pie crust edges, and several different crust recipes.  This is a keeper book and one I will use often.
B003O86FMW|5.0|catching fire  great book wonderful story kept my attention please don't mess up this movie either like the first one
B00A0JBYRE|5.0|Lucy Liu and whoever plays Sherlock are both AMAZING. Didn't know how I would feel about a female Watson (was there going to be a love connection?), but Liu nails it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|hunder games wonderful book great writing slow but kept my attention horriable movie sge let them mess it all up was very mad when I saw the movie
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|Really entertaining! Loved the backstory on the characters you learned about in the first Underworld. It holds it own even if you haven't seen the first movie; makes you want to go back and check it out.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|fifty shades darker bored same ol same ol does this writer know any better words than they thought up bad wuitting not interested in movie
B009HV2JT8|5.0|It was totally different but as I kind of expected of Tim Burton (sic ).  It had something different through the whole show.
B001KZG99A|1.0|Some good actors her, but a predictable and totally unbelievable script. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have 2 hours to waist. The sequel is even worse.
B001706I5I|1.0|Clicked on HD. Page refreshed, but upon order and play realized I was still watching the standard definition. Totally not worth 3 dollars.
0525953728|5.0|Hard to put the book down. Makes you want to wish you were there, and appreciate what these guys do.
B006X415GK|4.0|Awesome product and fast delivery!
B008B68IEA|5.0|Bought this as a birthday gift my daughter loves monster high she has basically set aside barbie for monster high she loves the furniture.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|A show should be more than theatrics. There should be a story that pulls me in and character I can love and love to hate. Walking Dead does just that and it does it well. I take away one star because some of the acting is a little lacking from some of the more major characters, both protagonists and antagonists, but it's not a show killer. I eagerly await future episodes. Gimme gimme.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I thought that Mr Flynn left out the facts of the sinister dealings that our Congress has with their cronies that eventually leads to treasonous activities.  There is certainly much more underhandedness in the works than he portrayed in this book.  It seems that Flynn wants the readers to start disliking Rapp as he portrayed him as a crazed killer, rather than a Seal or Delta Force soldier trying to right the ills created by our Senators and Congressmen.  He certainly left the book open for a sequel with the killler of his wife and unborn child now working for Kennedy. Not too  realalistic.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Yes, I've seen the many negatives about the film. The occasional bad dialogue, one of the worst death scenes ever, and Christian Bale's weird and almost &#34;I could fall asleep any minute&#34; performance when in the bat suit. Seriously, he looked sleepy as hell every time he spoke. All in all, though, the film did it's job in entertaining me. The story wasn't great, but it was good. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is awesome. On my second viewing I skipped directly to the Bane scenes, being they were what I loved most about the film. This is definitely a 'must buy' for me.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Movie follows the traditional story of Snow White with some great twists and turns.  It was enjoyed by my 12 year old boy and 14 year old girl, as well as us parents.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Can't wait to read the sequels:) Hope the sequels are just as good as The Hunger Games! Happy Readings :)
1400052181|4.0|The most compelling part of the book for me, after learning how the the family was treated, were the bio-ethics questions. I surely hope that they will be dealt with by a panel of bioethists.<br /><br />I plan to read more books by Rebecca Skloot .
B000I9VON0|5.0|Sneakers is a fun and suspenseful spy flick.  As usual Redford and cast are great. Clever plot with good humor.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson's best film since &#34;Rushmore&#34;. This is a real gem. Super-stylized but it works. Wonderful cast, especially the two young leads. A great lyrical ode to the rush of first love, and of finding your soulmate .
B008BM0IUG|5.0|The book is an interesting journey through the past discoveries is physics and brings the reader up to date with what is being worked out now using high energy particle colliders
0547884591|5.0|Having watched the trailers I thought there wouldn't be much in the cookery side of 4 hour chef that I could apply as a vegetarian - but I was fascinated by the 'how to learn' side of things.<br /><br />After getting the book, I was more than pleasantly surprised on both counts.  Not only have I had enormous fun with creating amazing eggs,and discovering in the process how to make an omelette go at least 2.5 times further, but I still have a huge range of skill topics and recipes to go through, even leaving aside the meat and seafood parts.  If you do eat those, expect to gain a new appreciation of them, at least...<br /><br />On the learning side, in only one week I've made incredible gains in my flute technique using his 'outliers' philosophy, made good progress in Danish, boosted my memory skills and, more importantly, let go of the very stressful idea that if I want to have a lot of different interests in my life I need to somehow dedicate sufficient chunks of time to all of them.  The new philosophy is to make the absolute utmost of the time I do have to dedicate, and so far the results are fantastic.<br /><br />The book itself is a masterpiece of usability.  After you get over the shock of the fact that it probably weighs more than the entire remaining remnants of Tim Ferriss' bodyfat, and weigh up whether you can use it instead of the 4HB kettlebells, the next thing that will strike you is the amount of colour in it.  Not only is it crammed with amazing glossy pictures showing you in glorious detail how to follow the processes he's talking about (and incidentally, he also covers food photography), but every section is color coded both on the page and on the edges as well, so you can flip open very quickly to the part you want. Add in the cheat sheets, which are absolutely priceless, especially once you start creating them for yourself, and you would have to be really working hard at it to NOT learn anything from this book.<br /><br />...of course I 'cheated'and got the conveniently searchable (and portable) kindle edition as well ;-)  I have enough to carry with me on the commute, and that's what ebooks are for, right?
1451638450|5.0|I absolutely loved this addition to the Vorkosigan Saga.  We have been hearing for some time now that Bujold was working on a novel from Ivan Vorpatril's point of view and she does not disappoint.<br /><br />In this novel we really get to know Ivan Vorpatril and as usual Bujold is a master at characterization.  We really start to see and understand the personalities of her characters and what makes them tick.<br /><br />First here is a quick synopsis of the plot without spoilers, which is a challenge.  Ivan is on Komarr as a staff officer living the life of a bachelor away from home when friend and undercover agent Byerly Vorrutyer shows up at his door.  And there the trouble begins.  Byerly asks Ivan to keep an eye a lady on the run because she is in danger but he doesn't tell him anything about the nature of it.  Ivan, warily, goes to do his friends bidding, more out chivalry than anything else.  There he runs into the beautiful Tej and her companion Rish who are indeed on the run and need some help.  And they are on the run from very nefarious characters.<br /><br />Let's just end the synopsis there and suffice it to say that this sets off a string of events that are action packed and absolutely hilarious as well.  I think this novel is most like A Civil Campaign, a previous work in this series.<br /><br />One of the perfect things about this book is that fans of the Vorkosigan series will understand all the nuances and interplay that would be vague to those not familiar with the series.  But those who have not read the previous novels will unfold who Ivan is learn about some of the history of Barrayar, and his cousins and family, at the exact same pace as Tej who finds herself caught in this interplay and is equally in the dark about some of the nuances until they unfold.  I found that fascinating.  I wonder if readers really understand just how clever she was in writing the novel, intentional or not.<br /><br />I also found it fascinating to see Miles, albeit briefly, from other characters' points of view.  But she does keep the story squarely focused on Ivan and the predicament he finds himself in.  You could call this novel an action romance novel, if you choose too.<br /><br />This novel is face paced, funny, and in many ways heartwarming as we learn about Ivan and see him in a different light.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|amazing read.  did not know what to expect.  reminiscent of forrest gump on his run.  appreciated th thought put into this novel.
0393343405|3.0|Reading an age through the lense of a work of literature is an interesting if not new approach. Seeing Lucretius's On the Nature of Things as a seminal or pivotal book seems a stretch; doing so over 263 pages(plus 41 pages notes) seems to belabor the point, and a speculative point it is. What is lost through Greenblatt's approach is the overall influence of antiquity during the Renaissance on what is clearly one of the turning points of history. I would posit that the interplay between intellectual history and scientific advances are more complicated than the author appears to suggest. I see the popularity of the book primarily as an example for the hunger of many readers to find the magic key. That being said, I did find the author's discussion of major figures of the age quite stimulating, most notably his discussion of Thomas More, whom Greenblatt seems to view through a more critical lens than is typically the case. But then More is one with regard to which the author's interpretation has a fairly solid footing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game cleverly combines aspects of the &#34;regular&#34; Angry Birds games AND Angry Birds in Space, so you have episodes set on exotic landscapes as well as ones that deal with gravity fields, etc. in space.  So fun to have the sound effects of the Star Wars characters as birds and pigs.  Very entertaining as well as challenging at times.  I appreciate the ongoing episode additions to this and other Angry Birds games.  Terrific addition, Rovio!

B0094BB4TW|1.0|What was once quick, light and easy to navigate has become a headache that is mired in issue after issue.  With the latest update, check-ins usually take quite some time to become able to post (the wheel turns as it continues to try to find a location).  On the Kindle Fire HD, like others have posted, the app only will display the first 10 or show posts after the first use (on the first use, it seems to work flawlessly).<br /><br />Posting updates also takes some time, with the wheel turning for long periods of time.  I have found that despite the wheel turning, it does post behind the scenes.  As a result, you are likely to post the same thing several times if you try it again thinking that it did not go through.<br /><br />We all know that the move to the mobile app is hurting the bottom line for Facebook due to the lack of ads.  As a result, I do not believe it is far-fetched anymore to think that they are intentionally making the apps more and more frustrating and hoping people move back to the browser-based versions where they can display advertisements in full again.

B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day has always been an  artist whether it be in movies or recordings.  My Heart taught me that her son Terry was also a very accomplished producer and singer in his own right. Listening to Doris' singing on the CD I found that her voice and styling was remarkably unchanged in the twenty years after her last movie.  That auto accident when she was 15. unfortunately, kept her fans from seeing her as a triple threat by including dancing which undoubtably would have been great with her early training.

B004ADH1RI|5.0|As a child of the 80's, this movie is a part of my life. I am happy to have a copy now so I can share this movie with my children!
B006H5120E|5.0|This movie is forever a classic.  I had the pleasure of seeing this at my local movie theater three times in 1997.  I missed the 2012 3D re-release but, now I wish I'd gone to see it.  The picture and sound on this bluray are pristine.  Even the deleted scenes and documentaries are in crisp HD. It was definitely worth the upgrade from my old double VHS cassette version.  I only wish now that I had a 3D TV and 3D bluray player for those discs.  Soon...  If you are a movie fan, buy this immediately.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Beautifully written, unable to put down. Suzanne Collins is brilliant. I have read THE HUNGER GAMES triology again and again. One of my favorite series of all times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this is a wonderful story line. I love ana referring to her inner goddess. I could feel her lobe and heartache.

B00190OHD6|3.0|Interesting Premise Good Acting and some beautiful scenery but this has very serious overtones I would not call it a comedy but that being said it not a bad movie and I think Harry Connick may steal the movie. Kathy Bates is also very good as the mother Worth a look
1401937519|5.0|Anita's near death experience is a the true light at the end of the tunnel. It inspires me to live life fearless and free, to be me. It reminds me that I am the one that can change my life right now and that we have the power to do it.

B000000OUJ|2.0|upon receiving the item in the mail, i was surprise to see that the album was in bad shape. the CD booklet had been thru rough times for somebody not knowing how to re-insert it back into the front casing properly. even the back cover of the casing was in terrible condition seeing how it's been spilled upon. so far the CD itself is unharmed and haven't been scratched up in any way.<br /><br />i know it's nip-picking on such common trivial problems but seriously, it's like somebody handed me down this album with no proper caring. i expected more with the sense of buying something that is at least in good condition. that's the last time i buy anything that deceitfully been described to be in decent shape which instead the main product within is unscathed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Truly epic.  This is the first series I paid per episode to view and I couldn't have been happier to have been able to do so.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Love that I don't have to have the little alarm notification on all the time. Don't ask me why, but that just bothers me. I love apps that allow you to customize little pointless things like that. This one allows you to set a color theme, choose from alarms, ringtones, mp3's and playlists. It also cooks you dinner in the morning and brings the paper in. One of these sentences is a lie.<br /><br />I love that the snooze feature can be decreased in increments. For example, if I set my snooze for 10 minutes, it can decrease by whatever amount I want it to change the next time I press snooze. So I'll snooze for 10, 8, 6, 4 if I set my snooze increment to 2. Adding the math problems to encourage someone to wake up is good too. I like that the global settings of the app can be changed so that all alarms will default to a way I want them to be. For example, all of my alarms have 15 seconds to crescendo to full volume, all use the same ringtone, and have a snooze increment of 2.<br /><br />This app also has a timer. The timer is pretty good, but I don't use it very often.<br /><br />This app is worth the money. Works great on my Galaxy Note II. It can also sync up with Google Now on Android 4.1 devices, so you can say &#34;Set an alarm for 7:00am&#34; and it will automatically set it up through Alarm Clock Xtreme. This is an app I definitely recommend... or should I say, Xtremely recommend?
B009GENZ12|2.0|Jessica, Jessica did you lose a bet? Why were you even in this less then B movie? I gave it two stars because she was in it. The story was the most pointless I have ever seen, It did have a few turns that you will not see coming other then that for get it.

B0065GC0BA|3.0|********SPOILER ALERT******** Please save yourself from devastation and do not read this review if you are considering reading the book. It contains my views regarding the ending.   I wrote this review years ago and apparently warranted a severe telling off from a few lovely, kind, and beautiful people for not putting an alert up.    ********SPOILER ALERT********** ********SPOILER ALERT********** ********SPOILER ALERT**********  I bought the Kindle edition and I admit that for hours on end I couldn't put the book down.  And I hoped, right to the last chapter, that the character of Will would change his mind.  I was very disheartened and disappointed when he didn't.  Its the sort of thing that almost makes you angry at the author for not giving you the ending you read through the book to get to.  By the time Lou and Will admit their true feelings for each other he only has a week left to live as he is so bound and determined to die at the six month mark.  Though I found Lou's initial response to Will's determination to stick to his guns believable, I didn't find it believable that she would have gone home and sulked right up to the end, not remembering the actual day he was scheduled to die until the last minute.  When she got the call from Will's mother I really really REALLY had hopes that he'd changed his mind and decided that the life and love that he and Lou could share would be worth at least a trial run, but no... What a tremendously saddening let down that was.  So much for love conquering all or hope springing eternal, eh?  Then at the end when she's in Paris and opening his note... how in the world could anyone be so casual about it all in a matter of weeks?  A few years after the fact maybe... but not a few weeks or months.  It was a very good read for the most part, but the ending was HORRID, not only for the disappointment to the reader but also for the message it sends to anyone who reads it -that life as a disabled person is not worth living, even withlove,romance, family, and immeasurable wealth.  I will also chime in with those who found the changes in perspective irritating/unnecessary/abrupt.  I don't feel that the 'asides' by the other characters added anything to what I already knew about them from the main character's narrative.  For the reasons listed above I'll give it a three.  If it had had a more upbeat and positive and believable ending my rating would have been higher.  P.S. : Also I don't mind spoiling the ending for anyone.  I think anyone who wants to read this ought to know from the start that the male lead is going to die in the end.  I wasn't prepared for it and it left me wishing I'd read something else instead...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My 2 kids love this game - it challenges their ability to analyze, budget and plan - and much more!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Let me tell you Indiana Jones is the best movie franchise out there. Action+Adventure+cast= great movie. i was very skeptical about buying this blu ray pack; mostly because of the sound and picture quality. Those movie were made long time ago so i wondered if they could bring good sound and picture quality. Previously i bought couple blu ray of old movies came out in 80's and early 2000 were poorly put together. but let me tell you those doubts are gone. These movies are remastered and sound quality is awesome perfect for home theater. i have never seen such a good packaging for the movies, you get sort of book, where they have place pictures of cast/scenes from each movie. you get the idea. for the price you cannot get better than this. Best deal out there.
B009SQOGZ2|1.0|I didn't make it past 5 min and didn't approve of the content. He told his mom he was watching sex and violence!<br />Not impressed! Returned it and got a refund!
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you want all three movies in blu ray and you dont care about the extras this the one for you. It does have some extra features + download movies for your media devices. What more do you want. Blu ray + media device copy + some extra features + book = a great $30 value pack. These Nolan's batman franchise are awesome. Never in my life i have seen better batman adaptation than this one. I truly wish C.Nolan keep making batman movies.

B002DW92SE|5.0|Nick Hornby's book about an aging rocker is so good, why not a movie!  Loved the main characters, normal people living their lives.  Great book for a long weekend!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This has just about everything you'd want in a sound/relaxation machine with a clever interface and varied, quality selection. I would, however,  like an alternative interface with categories when I don't want to put the effort into working the default. It's certainly inspired, but sometimes I'd like to do a sound mix quicker and more directly.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book, the symmetry between the characters past and present bring the story to a conclusion that is both riveting and suspenseful. One of the best books i have read in a great while
1439110123|3.0|Yergin is an excellent writer and his research is obviously extensive and exhaustive. This is an interesting book that gives insight into the development of oil, but I didn't find it to be very &#34;readable&#34;. I wasn't drawn in and anxious to keep reading; instead I found it quite academic and a bit dry. That being said, it is a great reference for anyone interested in learning more about how oil came to occupy the place it does in our modern world.

0812993292|3.0|I thought this book started out strong with a likable character in Harold and this unexpected journey that sort of crops up while collecting the mail.  The author does a great job of developing interesting characters and peppers in bits and pieces of background information that keeps you reading right up to the end.  I did find it disappointing when the hangers-on that one would normally expect from a journey like this appear; they seemed to enter late in the story and I had hoped the author would have just left them out.  So many of those characters are rather despicable and I felt there was a serious tone shift in the novel that seemed really abrupt and sort of against the flow.  All in all this book has some strong writing and character development and while the story is rather predictable there were still some little surprises along the way that kept me engaged in the story.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I appreciate that Joe tried a different angle with this book; the old west, wild Indians, & a gold rush.  I'm not all together sure it completely worked though.  I enjoyed his continued use of minor characters from previous books here.  Everyone who reads Joe's books no doubt have their favorite characters.  sadly, mine did not make an appearance.  one did get a mention (the shaggy brutes who rhyme with a brand of coffee), but I'm still waiting for the further tale of a particular fiesty little lady not seen since the first law trilogy.<br />Post First Law books have been a bit up and down for me, including Red Country.  Still all good reads, but none have had that gravitas Joe achieved with the First Law trilogy.  maybe it's time to start on another trilogy.  Between the Union, the North, the Old Empire, etc, there's got to be a major conflict (as in more that a book's worth) brewing.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is a great movie. The story line, acting, and scenery were really great. Toshiro Mifune as always was fantastic. This is a movie that I will watch time and time again.

B0090X4GJE|5.0|Ellie Goulding reminds me of a more commercial Bjork.  She truly tries to stretch the meaning of music with her more flashy, stylistic approach to pop music, mixing genres and embracing industrial sounds to create something truly unique and all her own.  I applaud her for that, because in this day and age the radio is basically a sea of similarly sounding pop stars who don't understand the concept of progressive thinking.  With a sophomore album like `Halcyon', Ellie Goulding really identifies herself as the future of music.<br /><br />She makes me excited for what the future of music holds.<br /><br />Building on the foundation she crafted with `Lights', `Goulding takes a remarkable step forward.  The album isn't without the occasional hiccup (the inclusion of `Lights' at the end was unnecessary and somewhat redundant and the she suffers in some areas with too much repetition, lyrically) but overall this is a tremendous effort all around with some serious highs to more than make up for the minimal lows.<br /><br />Getting those lows out of the way, aside from the pointless `Lights' inclusion, I could have done without `I Know You Care', which is far too repetitive and somewhat droll.  `Atlantis' follows it up with a little more heft but it lacks depth and the repetitive chorus isn't as catchy as it wants to be.  `I Need Your Love' sounds a little too desperate to be a club track, like leftover Rihanna, so I'm not entirely sold on it despite it growing on me a tad.  I really wanted to LOVE what she does with `Hanging On', a song originally done by Active Child and, well, it is currently my favorite song so she had pretty large boots to fill.  Her cover is a better rendition than what she did on her previous album (covering Elton's `Your Song') and so I applaud her for giving it a go and somewhat succeeding, but while Ellie has a great vocal gift, her range is too limited for the song.  That isn't a knock on her range, for she certainly has a lot of it, but that song requires near operatic range, and so you can feel Ellie reaching quite a bit in parts, which is a shame.  The song is too big for her.  She should have either stripped it back and toned it down to fit her vocals or passed on the song entirely.<br /><br />But that is all there is to be said in a negative fashion.  The rest of this album is near perfection.<br /><br />`Don't Say A Word', `My Blood' and `Anything Could Happen' open this album with such aggressive power.  They collectively show off not only Ellie's vocal abilities but her creative spirit and set a perfect foundation for the evolution taking place on this album.  They help unfold the layers to her vision.  They blend the melodic musicality that makes her so special with the hard hitting beats and triumphant experimental qualities that color outside all the lines and make this album so inspired.  `Only You' has a constant jab that embeds the song in your eardrums, and `Figure 8' is just a jarring fusion of haunting presence and dynamic energy.  It literally explodes in the chorus.<br /><br />`Explosions' is impeccable pop with attitude and `Dead in the Water' is a beautifully strung ballad.  `Joy' plays with an almost theatrical center (stripped down beautifully) and `the title track, `Halcyon' unfolds like poetry, which is such a splendid addition to the album (very singer/songwriter in tone and texture).<br /><br />In the end, this is a great album, one that any artist should be inspired by and aspire to create for themselves.requires near operatic range, and so you can feel Ellie reaching quite a bit in parts, which is a shame.

0062183591|5.0|I'll be honest.  I didn't want to read this book.  Reading about dishonesty seemed like a bit of a downer, like reading about bad manners--actually, that could be entertaining--or bad hygiene, or adultery, gluttony...you know, the less attractive aspects of human nature.<br /><br />Knowing of Dan Ariely's reputation as a writer-researcher, and the success of his last book [[ASIN:0007368542 Predictably Irrational]], I felt this book about dishonesty is one I SHOULD read.  Also read it in hopes that it might explain how a bunch of finance folks could rationalize selling tainted financial products knowing it could, and probably would, bring the world financial system down causing untold misery for billions of folks.  That seemed an important dynamic to understand going forward.<br /><br />This book explained that, along with many less important, but fairly interesting dishonest behaviors.  It also suggested simple and inexpensive things organizations could do to nourish honesty and integrity.<br /><br />The book is full of human interest stories, and Ariely's narrative is readable and entertaining.  Ariely and his team must have had great fun creating simple experiments to test honesty-dishonesty factors.  That would be a fun job. Imagine getting paid for having that much fun; it almost seems, well, dishonest.  Just kidding.<br /><br />The thesis of this book--great for Ariely to connect the dots for us--is that for most of us we are governed by two conflicting motivations: one is to see ourselves as basically honest and honorable (called ego motivation) and the second is to get as much $$$ or benefit as possible.  Ariely says we have a \\"cognitive flexibility\\" which allows us to juggle these--if we only cheat a little, we can still see ourselves as basically honest.  He quotes Oscar Wilde: \\"Morality, like art, means drawing a line somewhere.\\"  I don't know about you, but it's a daily challenge to draw that line.  Like when my local grocery store change thingy in the self-serve line malfunctioned and started spitting out $20 bills in change--it just wouldn't stop! I felt like I was in Las Vegas and all the fruit on the slot machine had just lined up or something.  Maybe this was God answering my prayers, and it wouldn't be dishonest to just take the $$$?  Yes, I forced myself to call the store employee in charge. She told me to take what was due me (only one $20). She seemed surprised that I just took one $20, and didn't just enjoy the generosity of the malfunctioning machine.<br /><br />There's a fudge factor, Ariely says, that affects our behavior. Ariely did an experiment once in which he put six cokes in dorm refrigerators at MIT and also plates with six $1 bills in the frig.  What do you think disappeared first?  You guessed it--the cokes were gone within 72 hours, but the dollars remained untouched.  A student could have taken a dollar and gone to the local soda machine, Ariely said, but didn't.  Taking $$$ seems more \\"sinful\\", than taking a coke.  Which explains, in part, one of the dynamics of the financial derivatives debacle which tanked our economy for the past 4 years--the farther away it seems like real $$$ is being looted, the easier it is to go along with dishonest practices.  It's only a derivative which will explode and poison the whole financial blood of the world.  But hey, the federal government--rest of the taxpayers--have insured the system so who are we really hurting? It's not really $$$.  Besides, everyone else is selling them.  And they benefit our company's bottom line--cheating that benefits our colleagues, Ariely discovered, produces more cheating.<br /><br />In every chapter there were fascinating insights and experiments relating to cheating.  For example, I always assumed expert witnesses were fairly objective--Ariely found from personal experience that when someone is paying you and complimenting you, it's much too easy to agree with their viewpoint.  I'll never look at expert witnesses the same way again.<br /><br />Little things keep people more honest this book tells us--like being asked to remember the Ten Commandments before taking an exam, or having a picture of a pair of eyes watching. Little things may increase dishonesty--like wearing fake knockoffs of designer garb.<br /><br />Ariely brought up the example of people dancing bizarrely in Europe 600 years ago--some dying of exhaustion before they finished--the condition was called St. Vitus dance.  Sometimes we see the same behavior at rock concerts, sports games--experts say it's a kind of social contagion.  Perhaps it was the dynamic which caused the witch trials in Salem. Is this influenced in part by mirror neurons, I wonder.  Watch out for social contagion's influence on honesty as cheating has a slow \\"socially corrosive\\" effect, claims Ariely.  Our economy is based on trust--when trust is gone, and when most everyone cheats as perhaps is happening in Greece--it can taint and bring down the whole system.<br /><br />Can't imagine a more interesting and readable book written on the topic which is supported by sound research and narrated by a smart and witty narrator.  Ariely also has a Q & A column in the Wall Street Journal, does ARMING THE DONKEYS podcasts in which he talks with other experts on behavioral economics--you can get them on itunes. And his website seems to have a lot of self-produced videos on behavioral economics and decision-making.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book--it was enlightening and entertaining. Honest.y again.<br /><br />Little things keep people more honest this book tells us--like being asked to remember the Ten Commandments before taking an exam, or having a picture of a pair of eyes watching.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book, and as typical of John Grisham you need a note pad to keep score on the players. I'll be reading another one very soon.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I am of the generation that enjoyed the original well enough but it was just a tad out of date for me at the time.  Then came along this polished remake and it fit me much better.  I love the stars and think this is just the sweetest movie with an adorable ending.  Its a must see every holiday season for me.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Kids will love it I did when I was one, and a lot of the jokes wont make sense to kids which is good because they are adult jokes......  Fun movie that never seams to get old buy it you will love it.  I almost removed one star because it wont bring me popcorn refills.........sigh.... I ll let it slide though
0553801473|5.0|After reading the previous four books in the series I had to get this book. IT WAS WORTH IT ! ! ! If you have read the other four books what are waiting for ??? The story continues get this book.<br /> The only bad this about this book is when you get to the last page and want MORE . There is going to be a book 6 cant wait.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It makes time fly when I,m waiting at appointments. this is my most favorite game to play and I now have my grand children hooked on it.
0345529057|5.0|Was introduced to Game Of Thrones thru the HBO show. As an avid reader I didnt want to wait on HBO so I got these books. I would have never picked them out on my own without seeing the show.<br /> I have to say they were great, and now I'm going to have to looking into other books by George R.R. Martin. He has an easy style to read, can write a real cliffhanger<br />  If you are looking at these, buy them, dont wait on HBO , a book ALWAYS  beats a movie, unless the movie came first and then the book was written afterward to capitalize on the movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another masterpiece!  Grisham knows how to keep you reading as you aren't sure what will happen next.  I truly enjoy all his books.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|Great CD. Many of their best songs on one CD. I think its their best, best of CD. I got it for my music library. with this CD I can clear a lot of space on my computer by dropping other CDs of theirs that have only one good track.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Got a bit techy on the laboratory detail, but &#34;Proof&#34; is what you get.  What I didn't hear/see was that author acepted God as part of the experience.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Has all of his Top hits on one CD. Not all of of the EJ songs you love, but so many you dont have to keep skipping to the next song ( if you listen to complete CDs, I like to make my own jumping around with various artists)
B000GX8B9I|5.0|This movie puts you smack dab in the middle of battle to save the crew of a downed helicopter.  It's riveting and horrific at the same time.  A very well done, and engaging film.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|this game looks cool but I have a kindle fire and I guess there is a screen problem and I won't buy 'till its fixed!!!  :(
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. Excellent movie, well made, great acting, wonderful scenery, all the elements necessary for an entertaining movie. Look forward to watching it again.
1892005034|5.0|This book provides an amazing insight on how to communicate. The book gives tips that we take so much for granted.<br />This book changed my life, specifically my relationships and has added some much value to my personal and professional life.<br />I hand out this book to my friends and family like the Christians hand out the bible.<br />Read it, and give this book a chance and see the change.
B00846REIS|4.0|If your looking for a book like 50 Shades of Grey, this book has many similarities and is a very good book. Ready for book number two!!!!!
0345525558|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I liked the reference to the meaning of the flowers.  Found that interesting.  An easy read with an interesting topic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Now I know what all the fuss was about... It's FUN!  Can't complain about popups if it's a free trail.  And that is exactly what it is.  A Trial version.  Spend $1 and you'll eliminate that problem.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan had a lot of living up to with the runaway critical and audience successes of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. In this concluding volume, we are introduced to the masked terrorist Bane, as he covertly subverts a CIA plane and swiftly proceeds to exterminate the crew. His physical prowess is matched only by his talents for cruelty and breaking people in mind and spirit.<br /><br />Cut to Gotham, where Commissioner Gordon gives a speech on the eighth anniversary of Harvey Dent's death. Not only is it now a public holiday, but it made possible the passage of legislation that empowered the police to round up a thousand members of organised crime. The war on crime appears to be won (with their next task, according to a young officer by the name of Blake, being chasing up overdue library books). Power-hungry politicians predict Gordon's early retirement, courtesy of the mayor. After all, who needs heroes in a time of universal peace? A week is a long time in politics, and eight years is an even longer time for Bruce Wayne, who has become disheveled, disillusioned and jaded. The loss of Rachel Dawes has turned him into a cripple with a goatee.<br /><br />There is action, romance and black humour aplenty (Johnathan Crane makes a brief appearance in the movie's latter half). While there are a few elements in common with The Dark Knight, these do not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film. Plotwise, everything comes full circle, character development is wrapped up very nicely, and there is little more that one could ask from a summer blockbuster. Although clocking in at 2 hours and forty minutes (before credits), nothing feels padded out.<br /><br />Unexpected twists abound, but without giving too much away, The Dark Knight Rises boldly goes where no other Batman film has gone before. This is an action film that borders on horror.<br /><br />This is edge-of-your-seat entertainment with a profound meaning. It is impossible to watch this film without rethinking the foundations that our 21st-century society has been built on.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Wonderful adventure movie for the whole family especially BOYS! Steven Spielberg really out did himself this time. Think Indiana Jones adventure with Star Wars campy-ness.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|predictable and not very exciting.  typical grisham.  light reading and enjoyable but not very challenging.  it is getting to the point if you read one you read them all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This pack have it all in one, one of the best movies ever, 3D blu Ray, Blu Ray , Dvd and Soundtrack
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think I must have a personality flaw I want to see (need to see) perfect on every game that I play.  Clearly I have a problem, but one I'll gladly live with.  stars<5++ to the developer/s.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The fans called for more action and less talking. This season definitely delivers on that request. There isn't an episode that I don't spend on the edge of my seat.

030758836X|1.0|When Gillian Flynn popped up on a super-serious Sunday morning talk show a week or two ago (a show mostly devoted to politics) and was heavily praised from a well-known veteran newsman, well, you know that a novel has gone into the special category of \\"ubiquitous.\\" There are more than 4500 review on Amazon to date and the four-star and five-star ratings far outweigh all others.<br /><br />I'm only posting a few sentences as a cautionary note to any potential reader--mostly because \\"Gone Girl\\" requires a major investment in time.<br /><br />There are two main issues I have with \\"Gone Girl\\" and they both deal with the plot's plausibility. Sure, writers stretch storylines all the time.  Suspending disbelief is part of the fun of reading, correct?  So this just deals with my preference level, when I'm shaking head in wonder.  I suspended for a bit, then found myself free-falling and, ultimately, crashing hard.<br /><br />You can find plenty of spoiler-riddled plot descriptions elsewhere but the basic premise of \\"Gone Girl\\" is that a wife stages her own disappearance to look like a possible murder, to put her husband in deep jeopardy. He's not the prince you might think he is at the outset.<br /><br />The biggest leap you have to make toward the end of \\"Gone Girl\\" is that after all this work and trouble and months of constructing an intricate scenario and with everything working as she planned, that she would (spoiler alert!) return. What the...?  The scene that inspires her to return? A head-shaker.<br /><br />The second biggest leap you have to make is that in the middle of the book she is hiding out / hanging out at a motel and has several encounters with others at the facility--extended encounters--and doesn't get recognized, even though her \\"disappearance\\" and potential murder have reached the level of national news.  Yes, she's added a few pounds and let herself go, but, really? \\"Hard to swallow\\" doesn't begin to cover it.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" didn't just jump the shark, for me, it jumped the whole ocean.  I was completely suckered into the plot at the beginning. At the outset of reading \\"Gone Girl,\\" I told a few friends that it was good--so far.  I sailed right past my 100-page rule (when I would normally set something down if it doesn't appeal to me).  As I said, I was pulled in.<br /><br />And then the plot began blowing up.  In the end, the implausibility factor hit new levels of gawking disbelief. Read only if, well, you absolutely \\"must.\\"e shark, for me, it jumped the whole ocean.

B000NTHT6G|5.0|Does an amazing job at stunning us with a performance that is unlike any other. I have watched this 9 times and I never get tired of it.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This band has a really great sound and it is the perfect album to listen to over and over again.
B00AGH6FD8|3.0|I liked the other Home alone but this was not that great. A bit boring movie, movie quality was good though..
0375805613|5.0|I loved this book as a child and wanted to find it for my daughter. While I like the Golden Books version best, this was a nice toddler friendly version.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I loved the inversion of the traditional formulas, the strong acting, the twisted plot, and the deliriously beautiful visual FX.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|This game is lots of fun. Many different games to choose from. Wish there was an app for iPhone. Beware Tap the Frog is addicting!
B00498YZH8|1.0|What a boring movie!!! It is well acted, but that doesn't make up for the fact that the movie is so BORING. The only reason I watched and and am writing this is because I'm at work and needed something to do. I'm glad I have a prime membership and didn't have to pay for this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game with all of the people you can get and posters and coins with al lot of awsome stufffffffffff love itttt
B00881PPTO|5.0|Great app but I see no difference between Kayak &#34;Pro&#34; and the regular, free version in the Android market. Maybe the free version will eventually add ads, and this one won't, in which case it will be an improvement. Great as a free app (Amazon daily promo) but not worth buying, otherwise.
B00818J504|4.0|I enjoyed this eBook, and do feel it was worth the money. And I will definitely read it again, in an indeterminate amount of time in the future.<br /><br />That said, there were a few downsides.<br /><br />First, the technical: as an eBook, device support is limited. It requires a device with a color screen. This makes sense, as the book contains a ton of photos, and would not be a worthwhile experience on a B&W eInk display. Unfortunately auto-rotate and pinch-zoom, which work on 99% of all other eBooks on my iPad in the kindle app, do not work.<br /><br />And now the book's story: on the whole, I think Ke$ha achieved what she set out to do - sharing her crazy life and her obvious passion for it all, with her fans. However, I did feel the book was too short. The volume of photos feels like it is masking not enough writing.<br /><br />This might be an unfair evaluation on my part - after all I still feel the author's *main* goal was achieved - but I feel this could have been so much more if more detail and self reflection was written into it. I was reading it expecting what I do from my favorite autobiographies, which cover what feels relevant, with great insight and self-reflection. The author gives their unique experience and perspective &#34;life, the universe, and everything&#34;, based what they have done and how it has affected them.<br /><br />And this is where I felt this autobiography fell a little short. Plenty of factual detail, and a reasonable level of insight and self reflection. But in the end I feel like it was a thoroughly enjoyable Wikipedia article with *lots* of photos, sourced entirely from primary material, but lacking the depth I hoped for.<br /><br />I still maintain it was a worthwhile purchase, but I had expected a bit more.
B0081BU42O|4.0|This is an atypical Culture story.  It starts explosively and slows down immediately before taking off again.  The atypical part is that a lot of the story is  tongue in cheek.  For example the story of three monkeys, hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil is taken by a man who has certain memories removed he kept in his eye balls.  In the end I was left looking at a number &#34;evolved&#34; sentient beings who still retained the foibles of us ordinary humans.
1455519006|5.0|probably the best book I have ever read, it was a library loan for 7 days, and I read it in four. i simply  could not put the book down, the story had my Attention after reading the first few pages, the ending was what it should have been, wow
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Our familiar characters continue the journey- felt cut short at the end.  The book dragged a bit through the beginning and again in the middle.  The Roman adventure was exciting but felt anticlimactic to end the book there.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|I am reading this book on my Kindle and really enjoying it. I find it very easy to read and cannot put it down. It is full of the tension that one expects from a Rebus novel. The detail of the information about Rebus continues to add to ones interest in the now retired detective and it is good to see that he is not reformed. It is strongly recommended for reading even for readers who are not fans of Rebus.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|this is good an it's believable and creduble<br />loved it<br />I would highly recommended it<br />if you want something that other NDE'scan relate to buy this book
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I cant get enough of it, watching it for the second time. The Violence and Betrayal goes sometimes to the extreme.
1419703692|5.0|Ordered this for my brothers birthday awhile back, and he loves it. Provides a solid couple of hours of reading through all the material, and is a lot of fun to see the ideas/drawings behind the creative process and character design in the Dark Knight series. A must have for any true Nolan Batman fan!
B005NNUKF4|4.0|More please!  This would have been absolutely astonishing with more music around more interviews.  How did &#34;Live at Pompeii&#34; play into &#34;Dark Side?&#34;  David Gilmour's studio work is better than most bands' live performances.  Wish U Were Longer!
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|Ordered this chest rig as a birthday present for my brother before a big airsoft op, and he loves it. Runs a little big unless you tighten the straps way down, but since he wears a SEALs PT body armor vest underneath it, it works just fine without too much adjustment, and carries pretty much everything that he needs during a field game.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|Ah, honestly a little boring and recycling of old jokes in semi-new situations, but still an entertaining sequel worthy of the franchise.
1608871045|5.0|Ordered this for my brothers birthday awhile back, and he loves it. Provides a solid couple of hours of reading through all the material, and is a lot of fun to see the ideas/drawings behind the technology in the Dark Knight series. A must have for any true Nolan Batman fan!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I had an enjoyable experience reading this book. From the detailed recipes that will keep me busy for the next couple of months to the hunting section, there's something for everyone in the 4 Hour Chef.<br /><br />Great work, Tim. You're 3 for 3!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Excellent, I did not have to go out to a video store and it was a beautiful picture, so clear and the colors were brilliant!  I love having a video library with no clutter around my house and the ease of having all of my videos stored by Amazon.  What an amazing system it is!
1250027624|4.0|Downtown Abbey is hugely popular here in the U.S.  I have not seen any of the shows, but I love that era of fiction,  I felt this book would be a good introductory for me to become familiar with the story.  Hopefully the series will be more enjoyable for me when I watch them.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Tons of twists that set up incredible Season 5.  Jax's & Gemma's characters are changing, amazing season.  Can't wait to see the next season after this finale.
B009HELT3C|4.0|These movies are humorous and worth the money. Although I'm not a Will Smith fan I can tolerate him if the movie is good enough, and some of his one-liners were zingers. The casting and acting of Josh Brolin was brilliant; now him I like. The ending did take me by surprise and improved my overall opinion of the movie.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I really want to like this game but the game screen is too big for the kindle fire. I love games like this but I cant even touch let alone see the pencil to draw stuff. pleeeeeeeaaaassseeee fix. kindle fire owners don't buy till this problem is fixed
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|This flick gathers together most of the over the hill action movie heroes. Of course it's over the top, but enjoyable. The appearance of Chuck Norris was funny, and there were plenty of one liner digs at each other. Seeing these guys age on screen sure makes me feel old.
B004OZZ624|5.0|This is a really fascinating movie. The pace and the tension is well tuned and kept you engaged from the start to the end. Really like it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a wonderful brain teaser for takers of most ages. the variable levels make challenging more advanced players easy! bright game play, smooth app, highly recommended!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it's a fun game but the problem is it always asks you to pay for gems that you need to progress through the game (be you have parental control before giving your kids this or that's an easy 100 lost) same with the social plug in, it's a children's game 5 year olds don't have facebook accounts so the social quest should be an option not a requirement, to get the hearts to complete quests<br /><br />good game needs some adjustment.<br /><br />friend me if you want to get hearts on gameloft: prucan56
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Fun movie. Arrived quickly, packaged well. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I was expecting it to be good given the previews and the hype. I definitely was not disappointed. I wish that I'd have seen it in the theater.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|We play Kapla Blocks by the hour in my household.  It is quality time and seems to calm the atmosphere.
B000YHG72E|5.0|We love this movie and had to add it to our holiday collection this year. We watch it even without the kids for a great laugh while enjoying the spirit of the Christmas season!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I like the season so far... I can't wait to see more! I am sad to see this show come to an end.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Michael puts on a great show:) the music moves you and the stage performance and presence of the dancers and musicians keep you dancing r.i.p. michael long live your gift and art!!!!
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I only ever saw one episode of the TV series and have occasionally come across excepts from the books. This was a wonderful read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002RI9UBS|2.0|The book was an extremely long wordy description of what seems a totally unrealistic story.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone as it a rambling discourse.
B0090RSYVG|5.0|So, like most girls out there who loved Thor and The Avengers because of the glorious villain Loki, I most definitely wanted to add this to my little &#34;Loki Collection&#34;. Super cute!! Really tiny. But just like a LEGO figure. Joints bend and everything. Because it's so tiny, I decided to just keep it with my little nerd collection and not use it as a keychain, in fear of losing or breaking it. Love it!!! I couldn't find this any where else. Good buy from Amazon, as always.
B006RXQ3T6|4.0|Great movie. You can tell that the movie filmed doesn't support the HD quality so I wouldn't bother with the HD unless your player only allows it.<br /><br />5 stars for the movie, 2.5 stars for being in HD.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Excellent book!<br /><br />I must note that \\"Willpower\\" isn't exactly the best word to describe the book's content.<br />It's not about pushing yourself through the agony of your constraints, it's about creating habits that help you ENJOY reaching your goals.<br />The book describes everything you need to know to be the \\"self\\" that WANTS to reach your goals, and not getting into your own way.<br />It describes the best ways to fill the \\"willpower reservoire\\" (meditation, exercise, etc), the correct attitudes and the common traps.<br />The book is amazing. I would recommend not rushing trough it (was my mistake).
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I like Adobe for my PC and Laptop, but when I loaded it for the Kindle Fire HD it caused the system to freeze multiple times.  I was about to return the unit to the store I purchased it from, but decided to remove the app first.  Since I did that, I have not had any issues with the Kindle freezing up and either requiring a Hard Shutdown or having the device restart itself.<br /><br />Be wary about this app.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|Normally I don't like animation but this is so good that at first you don't know it was animated. The message is to believe. When the others stopped believing the bell didn't ring.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read this as a child then again as an adult. I love this classic. Read it to my kids, my son wants to be Tom sawyer.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham and Tom Clancy always put together brain engaging novels. I have to give this one a 5 * rating. Murder, suspense .... thrills and spills . Just like a darn good movie! Make sure you have a day or 2 set aside for reading pleasure. After all that drama, I suggest you also get this ebook about Mothers In Law  [[ASIN:B00AKWSWOY Mothers In Law ..... Vengeful Creatures ?]].... yea yea I know ... more drama but .... makes for good short and spicy read!
B008M721MS|5.0|Since the Kindle has only a front facing camera, it won't be as &quot;good&quot; but you can still Skype. I have noticed a few bugs such as not being able to accept calls after I have been on for a while, and sometimes the call doesn't go through even in excellent WiFi.  I recommend this app for you if you have good WiFi and you love keeping in touch with your friends! Since I travel a lot, this is great for me personally to keep in touch with my family and friends.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Love this book or hate it, it's still very popular! I've been reading and reading and reading and can't seem to reach the end. Not really a big fan of multiple page ebooks. I also recommend getting this ebook about Mothers In Law! I guess you could call it 50 shades of perhaps misunderstood mothers in law! Makes for better reading if you ask me, then again that's my opinion  :)  [[ASIN:B00AKWSWOY Mothers In Law ..... Vengeful Creatures ?]]
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard this was such a great series! I am so sad that this poorly written garbage (and I don't mean JUST the erotica) is considered literature by anyone! This book (and I assume the other two books) are written as maybe a twelve year wrote it. The verbage, terms, expresions and sentences are pathetic. So badly written it's a shame and I could not finish it.  I would recommend Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty.
0316228532|1.0|Buyer Beware, if anyone other than J K Rowling had written this mess, it would be tossed into the editor's rubbish bin with great justification. I feel I have read this book twice, for all the sentences I had to re-read due to the change of subject midway thru. If Ms Rowling believes that the overuse of the F word makes for an adult book, Sorry. It is an ugly place, inhabited by uglier people that she has taken us to. I made it to page 308, when you think that things can get no more depressing, turn the page.<br />I could find no justification for this book. I would like to find the right words to use to sway anyone from having to suffer, as I have, the confusion and disappointment with Ms Rowling. There must be beauty and love somewhere in England, but it is not to be found in this terrible excuse of a book. Save your money. Ms Rowling does not need, nor deserve it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wish this version had a 3 card shuffle to make it more realistic. Overall, this version is enjoyable even with the adds between games.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Hard to surpass the last....but it is equal.  It is definitely worth the watch and I am glad I got it in HD!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Love this item. Love it, love it, love it. Works even better than I expected. Super easy to install on the desk.
B002JIBA8W|3.0|This was not as good as the television show but was fun to watch the similarities.  Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B003SHDRQ6|5.0|A book that any serious drawers should read and have. Very interesting comments and you will learn to see things differently that you use to see. The vision that Mike Mattesi is sharing just show how much experience he has in making dynamic drawings.<br />The books contains so many awesome and inpiring sketches.<br />After reading the book i felt i never watched my model correctly....
B000TU16GS|5.0|My middle school age son liked this book so much that he asked for the next book in the series.
1608871088|5.0|One of the best &#34;Art of&#34; book i have. Beautiful artwork and very inspiring comments on the production process. I think it would have been greater if they had put more character design, just very few process  for each character development. Tons of environment design which worth the buy.
034580404X|5.0|my partner doesnt read much but she sure has jumped on this box set!! maybe its the raunchiness but whatever, shes reading and cant put the books down!!! the set came as expected and the books have re readable value so we are satisfied!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and it a joy to play because I don't have to jump through hoops to continue to play the game like you do on facebook.  My daughter and I actually play together.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This is a real good movie it has just about every action star that plays in any action movie,it keeps you on the edge of your seat,if your an action fan this would be the one to watch.
B000002LMK|5.0|This was a replacement CD for my husband, he immediately took it out of the package and listened to it, he is a HUGE Neil Young fan.
0425263908|5.0|Loved this book...can't wait until the 3rd book comes out. This book is a very good read...much like fifty shades of grey
B002W5UVSM|3.0|I haven't finished reading this book on my Kindle yet.  Probably the reason I haven't finished is because I'm having a hard time getting into the story.  Maybe it will get better or maybe it won't.  I'm not sure.<br /><br />Another thing that is hampering my &#34;liking&#34; this book is that I just finished &#34;Beat The Reaper&#34; and loved it.  Great book that I also read on my Kindle.
B00005JSGK|5.0|One of John Waynes best movies in my opinion lots of action while they are catching animals for a zoo
034580404X|4.0|Bold for everything covered....but quite a love story.<br />I can now understand all of the hoop la over these books.
B0041KVWI4|5.0|Love everything the Beatles do.....the deluxe box is a great buy.  Surround sound in 5 to 1 mix is fantastic. If you have never seen the movie don't expect A hards Days Night....this is the beatles home movies with their freinds on bus just having a good time.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album is fantastic beyond words! Mellow vocals, and great lyrics with a fun beat. Every song is very well done.
B009E3EY38|3.0|As much as I would love to see these guys live, I decided against buying this DVD based on the reviews about the choppy editing. I've seen editing like this on concert dvd's before and it gives me a headache. It's as bad as the damn \\"shakey-cam\\" they use in movies nowadays. The sound quality on the other hand on the CD is amazing, and they still sound great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my grandchildren find it very interesting and challenging to conect the dots and colors.  Get a little frustrated when they are trapped behind a line.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Puzzles are relatively easy so far (even the 9 x 9 and 10 x 10), and this game doesn't have much length or any replay value.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book. Extremely excited, I settled down in a comfy spot and began to read. Dont get me wrong....Ms. Collins has talent. Yet, this book radiated a depressing, difficult to read quality. It took me a few hours for the depressing, moody feeling to wear off me. If you want to be disappointed an let down..... read this book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It is rarely that I run across a new novel about Mars that I really like and this is one of them. This is the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut and part of the third manned mission to Mars who, by accident, finds himself stranded on the red planet with no hope of survival until the next mission is scheduled to arrive. His struggles (and humor) is mesmerizing and I can truly say that I was hanging on every chapter as to what would happen next.<br />Sci Fi Guy says \\"Read this book\\"!
B0020M99LC|4.0|I didn't really think the female lead was much of an actress.  Typical Bond format.  I was a bit bored during the poker scenes
B00A5052YE|3.0|I love Alicia Keys, but this is not one of my favorites. Actually, it's probably my least favorite of her cds. I still gave it a 3 because it has a few good songs on it.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I always liked RiRi... but this album made me a fan. A proud one at that. I love most of the songs on here and the other few are ok. Real game changer for her. Rihanna put her foot in this one.
0307730697|5.0|This is one of the most powerful books I have ever read.<br /><br />I could easily generate a review of great length in helping all future readers of this book to understand why it is, in the end, an important book.<br /><br />Importance is of course a relative term, but allow me to liken the reading of the book to the experience I enjoyed when I first heard that amazing song by Simon and Garfunkle, &#34;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#34;. Those of you that have enough life experience will no doubt understand.<br /><br />Those of you that don't, I encourage you to listen to the song, and to read this great book.<br /><br />Doug Moore<br />Danbury, CT
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Fun and heart warming movie without scary scenes or the tragedy that seems to inspire so many Disney films. Good family fun.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|No problems with the blu-ray. I have no need for the DVD and wonder why they package them together? If I own a Blu-Ray player why would I want to watch the DVD? I'll give it away.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was the best superhero team movie ever this movie will go down as the greatest of all time like ali in his prime and what about the hulk (SMASH) nuff said
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I absolutely love this series.  If you like Werewolf/supernatural stories this series is good.  It can be slow at times but overall I would recommend them.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  And have actually met the author.  I havent decided if I want to read his side of the story yet or not.
B0095R76EW|4.0|It was a really funny movie, but it is very predictable like most romantic comedies.  Still worth watching if you haven't seen it.
0529064847|5.0|gett different point of views from different translaters, different wording, makes you discover what goes into choosing words what makes translations different,
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I absolutely love this series.  If you like Werewolf/supernatural stories this series is good.  It can be slow at times but overall I would recommend them.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|What the heck!  Why would they end Bruce Wayne as Batman.  I would not recommend this to anyone who likes Bruce as Batman
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I absolutely love this series.  If you like Werewolf/supernatural stories this series is good.  It can be slow at times but overall I would recommend them.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The great thing about this author and his books, this one in particular he is not afraid to kill off leading characters.  Once you know this it builds such suspense that you will stay up till midnight waiting for that countries chapter to come back around.<br /><br />I consider myself a WW2 buff but I learned things and more importantly now have a better understanding of the parties involved. I will recommend my boys read this book but perhaps wait until they are in college as it is quite graphic. I read one chapter during a lunch break and it was so depressing it put me in a funk the rest of the day. My only way out of it was to read that night to move on from the grief.<br /><br />The only area I thought needed improvement was in the beginning I felt like the book had fallen into some sort of pattern. Characters are often \\"flies on the wall\\" in important meetings and if you had read the first book you saw this coming right away. I will say though that I do not have a better idea on how to do it.  By the time the story really gets rolling there is enough established history that you forget about this pattern in fact this pattern may have even become irrelevant.<br /><br />The book also feels like \\"all quiet on the western front\\" with the realistic war time events that are dark,depressing and realistic. Again college students should read this.  Hopefully he will put a hero in the next one as it would be refreshing to see someone actually have a timely arrival for once.<br /><br />In closing Ken Follett's books are the best reading I have ever done. There are no detectives that continue to come back year after year to solve the big crime. No starving lawyer that will overcome the bagged lunch and become successful only to give it away in the end. Each new Ken Follett book is like discovering a great new author.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Good acting and very entertaining!  I don't know about the Hollow Earth Theory...but this movie makes me want to believe in a paradise below.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced, kept me interested 100% of the time. I couldn't put it down. Well done, Vince Flynn. Another great Mitch Rapp story.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was awesome!  I read it in one day.  I am a Gillian Flynn fan after this and Gone Girl.  Highly recommended!
B005FISBTO|5.0|It allowed me to go straight to the root menu instead of having to watch the &#34;spoiler&#34; advertisement, which the windows media player and others forces you to sit through.  It's a free program, had it forever.  My version number is 1.5.2.3456 if that helps.  Right click on the viewable window and hit navigate-&#62;root menu.
B000BT97AO|5.0|great acting all around; wonderful story.  maybe a little to bizarre/creepy for the very young, but i could be wrong.  this sits up there on my shelf with 'the princess bride' and 'the adventures of baron munchausen': movies i could watch over and over again and still enjoy.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|I bought 8 of these bulbs to replace the lights in my daughters room (that are ALWAYS left on).  I got them and 7 were fine, 1 was shattered, no big deal, it happens simply returned it and they sent a new one.  They have been in now for 4 months and for the last 3 months I have noticed a year over year decrease of about $15 per month.  This means that they should pay for themselves in about 3 more months.  The 54 wattage reduction really is a significant drop and with just 8 replaced I see a difference.  I have begun swapping out all the bulbs in my house with LED where I can.<br /><br />I did -1 star since they are quite expensive, I would add it back if the price dropped under $5 each...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|So clever and endearing. I loved every page. I would read it again .you don't have to be a dog lover
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Good movie, I like it that is why I bought it actually this copy went to my sister's boyfriend, I thought that he too would enjoy this film. Combination of seeing what happened to the former Soviet Union projects and the legacy of one of the instances of the damage that the Nazis inflicted upon Europe
0143119680|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:B00A6VAPCQ Borne of Mist (Mistborn Chronicles)]] & [[ASIN:B00722UOPK Calling Down the Wind (Elementals)]], the greatest gift from another author is the one that shuts down my internal editor. DISCOVERY does that, then takes me on a fiendishly delicious romp through history, mystery and occult that kept me up and reading all night. Can I just say I no longer pull all-nighters with impunity? Still. She delves into evolution of exotic species of daemon, witch and vampire that tickles my biologist's soul, then banks my romantic fires with Matthew and Diana's journeys toward intimacy. Another reviewer called this a 'mixed bag' and it is--exactly what I love in a novel: non-genre specific with enough reversals to keep me going. Next on my reading table? SHADOW OF NIGHT. But first, I need to catch up on sleep.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Nice little clock. I have trouble finding a clock that is large enough and bright enough with the right kind of alarm bells that can get my attention in the morning. Bravo.
0544045203|3.0|I am glad that I read the book before going to see the movie. I wouldn't want to watch a sweet zebra, a lovable oragutang and a hyena being eaten alive by a Bengal tiger set adrift in a lifeboat after a ship sinking. Also in that life boat is a 16 year old precocious son of a zoo keeper. The young man prays at one time to Krishna, Mary and Mohammed and works out a scheme to keep himself alive after the amiably named tiger, Richard Parker, has devoured the other living beings bit by bit.  There is more gore as the vegetarian boy catches and kills ocean life and stakes out his own territory for survival. I felt like I was reading an especially brutal allegory for life.<br /><br />I have noticed that recent authors seem to be overly fond of long listings which indicate to me the author is too impatient to flesh out the lists into narrtive form. This book has many such lists, including the garden flowers seen at home in India, American zoos willing to pay top dollar for zoo aniumals, the life-sustaining supplies found on board and the ocean life beneath the life boat. One description which stuck with me, along with the bloody ones, was the pattern of fish coming and going like rush hour in Boston, except that the sea highways are on multi levels.  The book is advertised as an \\"adventure tale so filled with love for the animal kingdom that it ought to roar\\".  There is a great deal of information about animals, but for the squeamish animal lover, like me, the death scenes were too much. I won't even watch the predator scenes on Animal Planet, so I know I won't go see the movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|i have to say i love this game the dragons are awsome and there are so many to collect and so much u can do it never ends!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had so much fun with this on my kindle that I got it for my daughter to play on her ipod and she loves it too. The further you play the more challenging it is. The last few levels were pretty tough. I really liked the way that the game lets you solve things different ways. The more creative you are the more fun you can have. I had fun drawing my own character and I really liked finding all the puzzle pieces to unlock the bonus level. After I finished the game I went through the trophy garden and found more fun things to go back and try. This game worked fine on my kindle fire (I have the regular kindle not the HD).
B003O86FMW|5.0|I resisted reading the hunger games trilogy for a long time because of its immense popularity.  I am so glad I finally caved.  Catching Fire was even better than the Hunger Games.  This book will not disappoint.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|What's missing? The new ebay feed. I really like that. You have to retrain yourself on a few minor differences in how to get around the site, but pretty great app all around.
0823003590|4.0|The method involves making shapes rather than lines with attention paid to edges. The resulting portraits have a good sense of the volume of the head and show light direction clearly. There is less emphasis on showing the relative dimensions of the features, for example the eye is usually 1/5th the width of the head in front view. However these dimensions are easily found in many other books on drawing the head.<br /><br />The drawings in the book remind me of the painterly style of when working in oils acrylics or pastels.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Wonderful, great, useful! And many other A+ descriptive words. This app gives the user an edge in the &#34;real tool&#34; world. Again, I say wonderful.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A light hearted and original story with some very funny moments. The plot is a bit complicated but works out in a satisfying manner at the end.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|It really is sad that I had to pay for this to use my camera. I know that using the ES file explorer can help you unlock it, if you have the time or care to chase down new knowledge on how to manipulate systems; But if you want to skip all that this is one app you can use - and it works (which is why I gave it a whole 3 stars) . Disappointed in kindle for this action...Really, shame on them. But so far this is one of my biggest complaints, so Go Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. :)
B009X01GJ2|4.0|I'm very happy with this cover for my new Kindle Fire 8.9.  It's made of a nice soft leather.  I like the revolving feature, so that I can easily read in the portrait mode.  I wanted a red case, but it didn't come in red, so I ordered purple.  It's a nice purple and I like it...although I still with they had red!  All in all, very happy with this case.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is really a &#34;need&#34; for your Kindle Fire HD. It makes so many other apps easier to manage and use. I am happy/grateful that I stumbled upon this one. It brings all your documents, pictures, apps, and games into one useful location.

0525478817|5.0|The fault in our stars is an amazing story about hazel grace lancaster who meets the charming augustus waters at one of her group meetings. Through the novel you see how their emotions and actions towards each other develop and change over time. This is by far the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. John green has the ability to depict such realistic characters and has more knowledge of what goes on in a teenage girls life than I do amd I ama a teenage girl, but this book in my opinion should be considered a classic eventually. Buy it !!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Nice app for the novice user. I don't know all there is to know about twitter, but it works for everything I need it for.

B00A3T5CGU|1.0|Very disappointed in this product. It took forever to download, and then when it was finally finished it didn't work. When I tried to open it I got blank screens. Bummer because I really need a mapping system I can download and use when I'm not connected to wi-fi.

I'm glad I watched it.<br />Only a few movies I will buy to have AFTER I watch it and this is one of them!!!

B007TXN4TK|5.0|great fun she loves to play music and sing songs shes love to follow the keys and learn how to play it
B000957O7S|5.0|My teenage daughter and I kept borrowing it from the library. So I finally just decided to buy it.  It arrived very quickly in the mail.  My daughter will be pleased when she gets it for Christmas.  Just one of the fun, feel-good films.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I have liked sliding games in the past and this one for the Kindle fits the bill. Graphics are simple but colorful. The music is very pleasant and not irritating. Game play may be a bit slow on certain touched, but overall not bad. The only thing I do not like is the fact that I think it might be almost impossible to make the target score. Every square you move to counts as one move. The movement of one piece should count as one no matter how far you move. Download and enjoy!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Such a great movie.  All the actors are amazing.  Michael Fessbender's voice (in the movie) just does me in.  So happy I own it so I can watch it whenever I want!
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|It's more like 4.5 star because at one point the POV switches and the pacing slows near the last half hour, but this movie will haunt you for a long time. Excellent performances by all cast members, but Mark Ruffalo was exemplary, and &#34;owned&#34; it. RDJ was also very good, but Ruffalo was on point in this one.<br /><br />Zodiac is the story of the 1970s serial killer who thrived off of eluding police and journalists with his cryptic, dark messages. Each character who gets involved in the Zodiac's web suffers in some way, and watching how Zodiac affects the lives of each character is painful to see. Definitely a must see, if nothing else for the excellent character study and nail-biting thrill rides throughout the time period of the Zodiac's horrifying reign.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The cast is just full of wonderful, talented British actors (of a certain age).  It also has fresh, talented Indian actors, fascinating locations, and a touching story that is very timely.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not a big fan of science fiction, but after reading everything on my list I was having a hard time choosing my next novel and the description of this book interested me because the main characters were children in an unusual setting. I was pulled into the story right away and found it a very enjoyable read.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|LOVE this movie.  Got tired of waiting for it to be available at the library.  Had to have my own copy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather app I've found. Easy to use, easy to save different locations and switch between them. Severe weather alerts are easy to spot in the app and these guys seem to be about as accurate as you can expect from a weather service.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this movie.  My daughter, who usually likes British period films, thinks it is to slow.  However, I think it is wonderful and educational and romantic.  My niece suggested I watch it as I am a Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre fan.  I'm really glad she did!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Highly entertaining. I loved the story and cinematography.  I will watch this again and again. I really enjoyed the characters.
B002QGSYRC|4.0|Great background on the cultural, political, and military forces preceding, during, and following the Korean War.  Very well written.  deb
B004GVUPFE|5.0|Since my purchase of my Kindle HD 8.9\\", I've discovered the majority of apps offered by Amazon; especially the FAOTD, have not been compatible with it. This is not Amazon's fault, however. The Kindle HD is a new tablet & many developers have either not tested or created their apps to work with it. But...this Move it! looks absolutely fantastic on Amazon's new line of HD Kindles! ( on both the 8.9\\" & the 7\\") With its crisp, clear graphics & vividly sharp colors combined with smooth game controls, I found this app to be not only eye pleasing but quite entertaining as well!<br />Finally. A game I like & actually play on my 8.9\\"! :)<br /><br />There are 672 puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty from Novice to Expert. When you tap Menu , A small bar will appear at the very top of your screen where you can then can choose several options to change the background color & other settings.<br /><br />If you like casual strategy puzzles & especially if you own a new Kindle HD, I highly recommend downloading this game as today's FAOTD. And, since it has only minimal permissions, it's certainly worth the asking price.<br /><br />*Warning: VERY ADDICTIVE!! =)
B002RKSZS0|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austin fan and this book, although not exactly like her other books, did not disappoint! I highly recommend it to anyone!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I'm not quite sure how this movie got so many stars, it seems a bit like a &#34;B&#34; level movie to me. I watched it with my wife and mom and all three of us were kind of like &#34;meh&#34;. I would actually give it 2.5 stars. Wouldn't watch again, and won't be watching the sequel.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austin novel. The characters are so well developed and the descriptions so perfect I felt I was there with them. I loved getting lost in the story and couldn't wait to read what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I thought this was a pretty cute movie. Definitely worth one watch, may watch it again sometime if there wasn't anything else on.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma. Well developed characters and relationships between. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this entire series! This is a great book, and I couldn't wait to find out how everything ended.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|A classic I feel should be read by every young girl. Little women does a wonderful job making you fall in love with all the characters. This story is amazing and I would recommend it.
B008J34466|3.0|The radio plays the only 2 sings worth really hearing.<br /> Its ok and its pink...but not her finest work.<br />I wouldn't pay for it if you can hear it for free
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austin fan. This is a wonderful work and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works wonderfully and such large keys and numbers.<br />I always misplaced my small calculators but I never misplaced my Kindle.
B009ANP4F4|2.0|I saw previews of this movie from other DVDs that I rented and what I saw in the preview looked great. However when I rented the movie there was something off with the visual component to all the dance sequences. I have very sharp and good vision and my eyes started to hurt a bit while watching these dance moves. At times I felt like something was a bit out of focus or \\"jagged.\\" At times I often said to myself, \\"Hym, the camera angle used to capture these dancers while doing their moves was suboptimal at best. They're really not being captured in the best angle to really show them off.\\" However, I learned later that this movie was originally meant for a 3D viewing experience at the cinema. So my guess is that this is why my eyes were picking up on something odd and maybe this movie would be more impressive visually while watching as a 3D experience.<br /><br />The acting was decent but the story line was the same regurgitated theme we've all seen so many times before. Young talented people living a hard life now have their turf threatened in some way and eventually collaborate together to fight for what's theirs through dance. It's such a cliche story line we've seen so many times already. After the first Footloose in 1984, the remake of Footloose in 2011 and finally the first \\"Step UP\\" in 2006 with Channing Tatum, I don't how or why directors and producers find any value in repeating the same old story.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Poignant lyrics, musically strong...one of the best new albums I've heard in quite awhile! It hasn't left my player since I got it.
0345803485|3.0|Okay, i know there are a lot of people and a lot of reviews both good and bad on here, so for me i am just writing the things that really irritated me about this book.<br /><br />First, Ana is a virgin. A VIRGIN? Really? At 21 years old?, and the fact that she has never masturbated lol. I just can not believe that. Has this woman been living in a convent all her life? I know there are some women out there who are 21 years old and still virgins, but that is so few i just found it hard to believe in this story.<br /><br />Second, she keeps blushing and biting her lower lip and thinking he's so gorgeous. Yeah, you've already stated he's good looking, lets move on. Plus Ana really irritates me, i wished i could have been in this book so i can smack some sense into her.<br /><br />Third, i kept laughing when Christian Grey kept cocking his head to the side. Is there something wrong with his neck? Yeah, he finds her interesting but does he really need to cock his head to the side all the time?<br /><br />Fourth, this man is 27 years old, owns his own company, can pilot an airplane, play the piano and feeds the starving. WOW, that's very impressive, but the guy is always with Ana, how the hell does he do these things? Obviously this guy has to sleep at some time, unless he's a frigging vampire lol.<br /><br />Fifth, I can totally see why some people say that the author took the Twilight story and re- wrote it into this story. Christian is Edward, Ana is Bella and Jose is Jacob. I can definitely see that.<br /><br />Sixth, i found myself laughing through out this book, and it had nothing to do with what the character's said, it was because the author loved repeating the same things over and over. I think i could have written a better book than what this author wrote, maybe i should have a go at erotic writing and sell millions of copies.<br /><br />I am very curious about the rest of the story in book's 2 and 3 and i will be reading the rest of the series eventually just tosee what happens to this couple, to me this book is like a car crash, you try not to look but in the end you can not help but look and to find out what happened to these people. If i do buy these books, i will keep the receipt so when i am done reading them i can return them. They are definitely not books i would want to keep on my book shelf and re-read again.<br /><br />This book is definitely not for everyone, my mom bought this book and when she was done with it she gave it to me. She hated the book, but i can see why she didn't like it. My mom is not into the whole dominant/submissive relationship and my mom said she wanted to punch Christian in the face. I really didn't hate Christian, he was controlling, but that's because he's a dominant male and he was affectionate toward Ana, and i don't always find that in those dominant/submissive books. The character that i really didn't like was Ana, i thought she was too much of a cream puff, and i thought that Christian should have been with someone better suited for him and the things he wanted to do.<br /><br />Update: I still haven't read book 2 or 3 of the series and i don't plan on it either. I just saw the trailer for the movie and i am hoping that the movie is better than the book. That's what i felt about Twilight by Stephanie Meyer, i thought the movie was better than the book.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I down loaded it for my grandson. He just loves it... Plays it when ever he's at our home. Yea!!!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Great character development in a work with some light-hearted or humorous scenes, but in general more serious than Emma, Pride and Prejudice... Austen presents a very strong heroine in Anne Elliot, whose only false step in life seems to have been her allowing a trusted friend to persuade her not to marry sweetheart Captain Wentworth. When they next meet, years later, he has made his fortune in the wars, and she has become the official spinster of the family, deeply regretting her decision not to marry him. What happens next is enthralling not so much for the plot, but the detail with which Austen describes the turbulent emotions of the outwardly calm, collected and staid Anne Elliot.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|I got my sleeve about a month ago and it looks great. The envelope flap is a little bit thicker than I would prefer, but the whole thing is sturdy and well-made.<br /><br />I know that someone else complained that their sleeve started discoloring their Kindle 4 almost immediately. I waited a month before posting my review to see if I'd have the same problem. No discoloration here; my Paperwhite still looks great.

0979019710|5.0|Every once and a while a book comes along that is more than it's hyped up to be, and this is one of them.<br /><br />If you're reading this maybe you believe in miracles, maybe you don't. Either way Hal's book walks you through a daily process that helps you create them and find them in everyday life, business, relationships, you name it. The best part is it makes it easier to transform our life than you would ever think possible.<br /><br />This book gets you up to do something about it every-single-day. It's simple yet extraordinary. The principles, methods and exercise you will learn (some of you might already know, but not practice consistently) will empower you to rediscover your best self again and again in this not-so-obvious secret transformation.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss has another hit in his \\"Four-Hour XXX\\" series.  Tim is a learning machine.  In his first book, \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\", he described how to effectively retire while producing a steady cashflow by creating and owning low-maintenance companies.  In his 2nd book, \\"The Four Hour Body\\", he described how you can reliably and with little effort, lose weight, gain muscle, sleep better or sleep less, and have great sex.  He did this by experimenting on himself using enormous amounts information synthesized from a huge variety of sources including reading the scientific medical literature and interviewing Harvard medical school doctors and Olympic athletes and coaches.  In this book, \\"The Four Hour Chef\\", he finally describes *how* he has been able to learn so much, including learning half a dozen new languages, winning the Chinese National Kickboxing Championship with only a few months training, and becoming a world-class ballroom dancer again with only a few months of intensive training.  Here he teaches us this new method of learning, using \\"learning to cook\\" as an example.  I am a professor and I teach for a living, and I can honestly say that it's possible his method of learning may become a revolutionary new method of harnessing the tremendous learning machine that resides between our ears.
1401324649|5.0|But Grandpa...Is that really true?<br />\\"Those who only says what is the truth, they're not worth listening to,\\" Grandpa replied.<br />Allen Karlsson had lived a long active life. In his younger days, he had been energetic and a sought after bomb expert.  Now, he's in a nursing home about to be honored by some distinguished heads of state and a number of nurses and doctors with a Centenarian Birthday party. The idea of such a party disturbed him.<br /> God had always blessed him with good health despite his love for vodka.<br />  Allen decided to escape this punch and cookies party, get him some much needed vodka, and disappear. He climbed out the window with little effort, but walking to the bus station was a bit painful, half way there he realized he still had on his bedroom shoes.  Allen informed the bus attendant he wanted to buy a ticket as far as his money would take him; which he learned was not very far.<br />  While he was waiting for his bus, a very unpleasant man asked if he would watch his suit case while he used the bathroom.  As you can guess, Allen's bus came before the man got out of the bathroom.  So Allen just got on the bus with the suit case and figured the unpleasant man could look him up if he wanted his suit case back.  The unpleasant man wanted his suitcase back.  Allen along with a new found friend soon learned the suitcase was full of money. This brought out the owner, the police, the underworld and many bad guys.<br />Parallel to this adventure, the author reveals to the reader the life of the centenarian. This becomes a thrilling account of 20th Century history.  How accurate this history was depicted, I am not sure. During his life, Allen Karlsson became friends with every head of state in the entire world.  How he got out of all the scrapes he got into makes for hilarious reading.<br />Not many authors can write clever stories with subtle humor.  That's my opinion. There are many books with wise cracks, silly jokes but not many that canmake you smile and laugh on every page.  This is an incredibly funny book.<br /><br />.

0345803507|1.0|I a passage of this book over my girlfriend's shoulder, and this girl knows nothing about cars. She kept saying the brand names like she was paid to do so. She kept saying Audi R8 over an over. We get it! The R8 is made by Audi. Thanks for the info. And again she doesn't refer to the type of Dodge that is following her or the BMW in the garage or the Audi SUV. It's like she googled \\"fast car\\" and picked the one she liked most. Then she googled \\"popular car brands\\" and just kept referring to them. The Audi SUV is obviously a Q series by the way. Then the nail in the coffin is her saying something about a 2006 Camaro. Come on! 2006 Camaro? This bitch is just making up s*** now. The Camaro was discontinued in 2002 and brought back in 2010. Too bad the author didn't do any research. Don't get this book if you know anything about cars. You'll be disappointed.

B00262G8NS|5.0|This is a Shakespeare play about the prince of Denmark and tragedy surrounding the family. Many people want to say the prince Hamlet is indecision yet he outmaneuvers just about everyone and has depth of vision. Now watch as Hamlet discovers who killed the king, his father, and how he attempts to get his revenge.<br /><br />Hamlet is played by Derek Jacobi who gets involve with other productions of hamlet and eventually gets to play Claudius in the Kenneth Branagh version.<br />However I still have a place for all the BBC productions as they do not try to exonerate but actually sound like people talking instead of spitting at the audience. As with many Shakespeare plays the get permeated with the popular characters of the time. In this case they may have been popular actors but where do you remember first seeing Claire Bloom or Patrick Stewart?<br /><br />This is the version I studied in school when they were trying to point out language differences and sub plots. Eventually I found my own copy as a supplement to a book.<br /><br />I still today play it periodically to compare to the other versions. I think you will find it a very good version if you want to know what they are really saying without having to read the screen play.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780021312 Hamlet - Criterion Collection ~ Laurence Olivier]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000777I88 Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]

0446541478|5.0|This book talks about how Israel, a nation surrounded by it enemies few natural resources and under political pressure from the world at large, has become an incubator for a hugely disproportionate number of successful start-ups compared to any other nation. It also asks what other nations could learn from Israel's success. For Zionists, this is an exhilarating book to read; it shows how Israelis turn adversity into advantage. For businesspeople, it gives insight into how to reward risk-takers and innovators.

I had great success with this video service on my Roku, too.  Sam Worthington is fun to watch in an adventure movie, but the script seemed like a repeat. The explosions at the end where fantastic even though it seemed ridiculous for the armed forces to be fighting out in the middle of nowhere in particular.  Didn't most armies fight over something tangible like a town or city? UGH!!!! Though the army Queen seemed very much at home in this type of movie.

I acquired my own version of the game and now he doesn't talk down to me with near as much pity in his voice as before.

Kidding aside, this is a great game and should be played by all.

B0050KVCES|5.0|You'll see several different compilations of Robert Johnson here on amazon.com, but I'm not positive this version I'm reviewing is the same one as the CD set I purchased a week ago.  I had one album, about half his recordings, and had never gotten around to getting the whole collection.  So when I saw this complete set for $6.99, it was a no brainer.  The sad part is, as enormously influential as Johnson was, it's a safe bet that with the exception of elder African Americans, few if any blacks have probably even heard of this man or his contributions to modern music today.  History is something that lamentably is being ignored in all facets of life, setting us up for eventual difficulties that had we been doing our homework should never have taken place.<br />  Knowing music history shouldn't be boring or sound like an assignment.  The delta blues Johnson sang and played were the audio equivalent of how difficult life was in the Great Depression-era Mississippi delta.  Life there, even today, is very hard, with little money and fewer jobs thanks to the enormous cotton plantations giving way to corporate farms and automated machinery.  The life of a sharecropper in the 1930's was just about as thankless and backbreaking as any job you could imagine, right there with being miners in dirty unsafe coal mines or workers in steel mills and factories that were deathtraps to work in.<br />  Johnson roamed the delta in search of whatever money he could scrape up.  He became a master of blues and slide blues, and his songs were drenched in the life and times of the day.  On one hand he loved his women, and as \\"Love In Vain\\" suggests, took rejection hard.  Superstition, so prevalent in the poor rural south, dogged him as he eerily seemed to know his lifestyle would not allow him to live much longer, the price of love, much of it extramarital, being a ticket to Hell itself.  The infamous \\"Crossroads Blues\\" bears this out and gives fuel to the legend that he made a pact with Satan that, in exchange for being a good guitarist and good with the ladies, the devil could take him at an early age.  As the last line says, \\"I believe I'm sinking down\\".  \\"Hellhound On My Trail\\", with its descending chord pattern was probably considered evil back then, as he continued to sum up what he thought would come of him in short time.<br />  The bottleneck slides in and out like a snake writhing its way around the strings.  We can't really appreciate the tone because of the poor quality of the original recording, but that ominous slide was no doubt a wicked sound in the back yards, tiny shacks that passed for black bars and wherever else he could play.  Not that Johnson couldn't cut loose a bit - \\"They're Red Hot\\" is a tune that, in my view, is a precursor and may well be one of the first rock and roll tunes ever.<br />  Robert Johnson would flip if he somehow discovered just how famous he would become, albeit 25 years or so after his death.  It makes sense in that context for all of us who write music to get it on an MP3 or some kind of file, because you never know who'll pick it up, or when.  The version of this double CD I bought is available at Hasting's.  You can no doubt order it from them, I would assume.  They also have a very nice double CD set of the best of Muddy Waters, who was the next evolutionary step in blues music, with one foot in the delta and one in the urban setting of Chicago.  History lessons were never more enjoyable.an that, in exchange for being a good guitarist and good with the ladies, the devil could take him at an early age.

B004Q9TYWQ|3.0|This is a book for the NC 17 set or more liberal minded thinkers of us as there's plenty of profanity and sexual innuendo involved. It's fun stuff to pass around after a few cocktails at a party for kicks and giggles because plenty of misunderstanding can occur beyond that which has already been established by iPhone's foolish autocorrections. I found that many of the funniest jokes were unfortunately given away online during the course of previewing the sample thus purchasing the full version turned out to be a waste of few dollars for the most part. Nonetheless I find that I still pull the book out with friends for laughs now and again when the conversation goes stale and we all need a good laugh over something really stupid that doesn't pertain to anything personal. It's harmless fun.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Awful, awful, awful. Love that era and the music but this was not watchable.  I was in my early 20's during this period and I can say there was not 1 realistic moment in this movie.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|This movie is an interesting, adult take on the classic children's story. Charlize Theron does a wonderful job; however, Kristen Stewart leaves a lot to be desired.  The story is weak in places and relies on special effects to carry it.  It may save you some time if you say you saw it and don't.

0425263916|5.0|I loved this second book, I couldn't wait to read more about Gideon and Eva, my heart broke for both of them, the hard time they had trusting each other, trusting anyone, the need to be close to each other to the point that it overtook them, the love so strong that you could feel it in everything no matter how difficult. There were three specific parts in the book that tore my heart apart(wont say what so not to spoil it for others), there are many ups and downs in this book that is true but not everything can always be easy, relationships and life are hard. I cant wait to see what Sylvia has in store for this wonderful couple in the next book. I love this author and this series is a must read.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I found myself wishing that Jaycee would say more about her experiences, and less about her trying to convince us and herself that it is okay to have her privacy.  She's gone through so much, and I feel for her immensely.  But she obviously is struggling with a story-hungry media and her girls trying to live a normal life.  Just say no.  I don't need two chapters on why you regret taking your girls out in public.  I get it.  I suppose I was hoping for more insight into the captor/victim relationship that causes one to not take opportunities for flight.<br /><br />Anyway, I commend her for getting her story out there.  I hope it was cathartic for her and I hope she heals over time, and her children, too.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|If you take this movie seriously then there is something wrong with you. Tom Cruise is over the top and lets it all hang out.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|The plot line was reminiscent of earlier Grisham books where the talented but obscure lawyer overcomes heady adversaries to outsmart them and make away with big bundles of undisputable cash.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|The Grey (2011) is a tale of survival set in the snowy Alaskan wilderness, where the survivors of a plane crash, battle both the elements, and a pack of hyper-aggressive, and extremely territorial wolves.  The film plausibly sets up a brutal crisis situation, but soon drifts off into fantasy, as escaping the wolves becomes the paramount concern.<br /><br />With a strong cast headed by Liam Neeson ([[ASIN:B001GCUNYO Taken]], [[ASIN:B004856SQ8 The A-Team]]), this gritty adventure is engaging, features some scenic cinematography, and definitely delivers some thrills.  Unfortunately, the unrealistic behavior of the wolves, and other discordant elements, along with some less than convincing special effects, soon distract from what could have been a more solid story.<br /><br />A group of oil company workers at a remote Alaskan camp, are on a night flight bound for civilization, when the plane unexpectedly develops problems, and crashes in the snow covered woods.  Only a handful survive, and John Ottway (Neeson), whose job is to hunt and kill wolves around the camp, emerges as the leader of the group.  Huddled in the wreckage of the plane, keeping warm is the initial priority, but after the survivors are challenged by a pack of wolves, and the animals kill  one of the group during the night, Ottway decides that retreat is their only hope.<br /><br />Supposedly acting to protect their territory, the wolves follow, and aggressively strike when the opportunity presents itself, further reducing the group's numbers.  The survivors eventually are forced to take desperate measures, but no matter what they do, they can't escape the pursuing wolves.<br /><br />The Grey has some great natural settings, and with a solid supporting cast that includes Frank Grillo, Dermont Mulroney, and Dallas Roberts, the acting is pretty good.  With the action largely driven by the \\"unlikely\\" behavior of the wolves, which in turn results in some strange actions by the survivors, the film's credibility is severely undermined.  Early on, Ottway is attacked by a wolf, and incredibly suffers absolutely no harm, as the group mostly fails to arm themselves.  The cold hardly seems to have an effect on the men, even after taking a dip in a chilly river.  Then when the story attempts to weave in spiritual and religious elements, it's difficult to take seriously, as things have already strayed away too far.  The mostly unconvincing CG wolves, are another major distraction.<br /><br />Competently made, and with some exciting moments, The Grey is entertaining, although it's more of a wilderness fantasy, who's \\"message\\" may largely be lost in the swirling Alaskan winds.  Rating: 3.5 stars.ty is severely undermined.  Early on, Ottway is attacked by a wolf, and incredibly suffers absolutely no harm, as the group mostly fails to arm themselves.

B004GVUPFE|4.0|The game is good but there is nothing new in this version of the game... I have played many different versions of this game for PC, and Android.. Almost all are identical .. the only thing the really changes is the graphics from game to game and the design. but the play is the same and the rules are the same as well. Fun and challenging game to kill some time. Not a game I would keep on my Tablet for to long only cuz it only has 112 levels and in a matter of 2 minutes I beat the first 10 already.. seems too easy but it's still a time killer. Fun game for kids to play to keep the distracted. 4 stars for the game only cuz it lacks change that sets it apart from the rest.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is J. K. Rowling's first foray into writing for adults. The story, set in an English village is a good romp.

B00395ZYVS|5.0|The main characters consist of an East Indian-born man (a doctor), U.S. born woman and their adopted daughter of East Indian descent who reside in San Francisco, CA. Two other stories are intertwined: the impoverished Indian mother forced to leave her daughter in an orphanage and the wealthy, educated extended family of the Indian-born man who live in Bombay (now Mumbai). Initially, I was turned off by the American woman character (she is also a doctor) who appeared self-centered and neurotic.  But, this character and others were played out with more depth as the story continued. This book deals with adoption, multi-cultural families, teens growing into their own, work / family balance in life for U.S. professional women and loss, aging and dying.  The story will remain in my heart and memory for a long time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I don't really watch TV. I don't pay for cable and I don't have an antenna for OTA channels.<br /><br />This series was highly recommended to me and I gave it a shot on Netflix. Needless to say, I loved it so much that I bought Season 3 on Amazon.<br /><br />It's a must see for anyone interested in survival stories.

0316187216|2.0|after reading all of abercrombie's other books i couldn't wait to get started reading this one. what a waste of time. He somehow even managed to ruin Logan's character . I am about 3/4 done with the book but could walk away from it anytime, keep waiting for something to happen but it just keep dragging on.

0547569653|5.0|Scott Jurek is an inspiration to what humans can do if they put their mind to something. This book takes the reader through the process he went through becoming the elite ultramarathoner and truly shows what we can all do when we push ourselves past the point in racing or in life when giving up seems so easy and going on seems impossible.

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Mega funny. So good for young or old. Just hilarious!<br />Discs were fine. Came within a week in a good box and bubble wrap :)
B008G8SFGO|5.0|all very listenable, no fillers. It reminds me of unmasked in a way that its a bit poppy here and there with good rock tracks too. The difference is they dont seem to be following a current musical trend but just playing within their kiss sound, which is great. And that debate about kiss has been the Gene and Paul project for a long time now, well it probably was from the start, so then they havent changed a bit !  members come and go...ho hum , so be it !  Sit back and turn it up - enjoy !
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am challanged by this game. As it is programmed for the computer to be the stronger of the player. As you know the dealer almost always wins.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|it was awesome to finally view halo in a live movie. and with an ok story to boot.<br />wish i was longer or at least that they make another one.<br />not giving it a 4 star because when i purchased it i was not able to play it on the Xbox360. it said video was not available. so i had to watch it on my smaller TV.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I liked it. It was enjoyable and I will start watching the program. I had not seen it prior to my purchase. Now it has me interested.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|We love this movie. Its going to be one of those Christmas classics for us. The Blu Ray is great quality. The only thing on the negative side is that the stickers on the box says that it includes the Justin Bieber &#34;Santa Claus is Comin' To Town&#34;, which we thought meant that the music video would be in the disk extra's, but sadly its not. The song is only played during the ending credits. Seems like it wouldnt have been too hard to include the 3 minute music video in the extras.
B008602KQI|3.0|Did not read the books so it was a little hard to understand the premise of the story but by the end you have a decent handle on what is happening.

B00AA7O22U|4.0|The movie was good with all of the old action movie heroes.  There were plenty of references to the old movies they stared in which were pretty funny.  The video quality was good.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Still my favorite musical of all time. Been watching it and listening in the car for 35 years!<br />I would rate it PG13 but really little kids don't get all the innuendo.

034580404X|4.0|The sex was explicit and way more adventurous than I would ever be but a lot of fun to read. My favorite thing about the book is that is made me remember being in my early 20's and a similar relationship I had (two insecure people trying to find security).
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|The subject title says it all.  Good dialog/writing and great acting/actors is all you need - not blood, gore & special effects.
1451629184|3.0|This book offered a deeper insight into Jaycee's torment.  It wasn't always pretty but her honesty opened my eyes to her side of the tragic happenings in her life.
B000JQV68A|4.0|Great story, easy to fall right in and lose yourself.<br />Maybe everyone knows a few people like this- that think they are entitled and above and if so their fall is a bit enjoyable.

B0031QVW2U|5.0|Im not going to talk too much about it. It does what it's supposed to do: Keep the RS-7 in place so it doesn't move too much. For me, it has made the strap considerably more pleasant to use.<br /><br />People complain that it is expensive, I agree but that doesn't mean it's not an excellent addition.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|Wish more people knew about Mika! He is great! His songs have meaning and are so much fun! Give this cd a try!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is the type of book that I am fond of and very curious about the mind frame of men involved.  This book did an excellent job of satisfying my interest.
B004K8WPUQ|1.0|I very disappointed with the mic: What a mad man designed this mic on this damn rubber bands that constantly come out and lost, and so hard to put back?! There are few spare amount of bands, but I'm already run out of them after one month usage. There is no way to use it, other than this rubber bands, there is no alternative mounting way provided. What's worse: sometimes I did not notice as one of the band came out and kept recording video, and got terrible nasty background noise as a result as body of mic touched the mount cradle, and my video were spoiled. I finally bind base of the mic with sticky tape to the cradle and now it's much better.<br /><br />Other than bands issue, it does not provide proper sound quality, I think for this money sound should be much better, for instance it's very sensitive to wind noise, as sensitive as my internal mic is. Unfortunately I did not had time to test it in first 30 days after delivery, otherwise I would return it back with no doubt
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I am very impressed with the way Nolan directed this movie series and i believe Bale is the best Batman of all time. this is an epic finish to the epic duo of Bale and Nolan. If you haven't seen this Batman see this and the first two.

B009JBZH54|4.0|One of the better Batman movies outside the animation ever! Makes Tim Burtons look like JUNK!! More real, better actors, gothic, sleek, coo-well!! Nolan did a EXCELLENT JOB  in creating these movies, who's up for the challenge next!?!? We will be waiting! ...Peace.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Overall a very enjoyable album with both haunting and catchy songs. So great to listen to, I find myself dancing (ineffectually) when I listen in the car. I don't know if it has to do with the band being from Iceland, but the vocals are arranged in a unique and pleasing way with interesting breaks and emphases. I don't know a lot about music, so I don't know what I would compare this to stylistically or sound-wise, but, for what it's worth, I love bands like Arcade Fire, Stars & The Lumineers and I loved this album.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This is my new favorite Christmas album. Their Carol of the Bells is beautiful. It's hard to believe that there are only 5 of them.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak, has left me utterly empty of thoughts in the most profound way possible. The way in which Zusak takes on the voice of Death wrapped up me completely in the eerie narrator behind the story. Zusak's manipulation of words to build and mold and stretch emotion is flawless, and I felt my arms become traced with goose bumps as I followed Liesel and Max's stories. As a result of both word choice and style, Zusak succeeds in very meticulously and subtly extracting emotion. Zusak brings Death's voice out to add to the heaviness and numb reality of the book. Zusak manipulates emotion and words throughout the novel using a unique style and rhythm in his writing to place the reader in a powerfully susceptible position.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Apparently the app came with a few clues, after that if you want a hint you have to pay for them.  Wish I wold have notice that before I got the app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This would be a good choice for a book club discussion as the author gives much ground for reasonable minds to come to different conclusions as to several things, but particularly the ending.  This book was a book club recommendastion but I did not know the basic premise of the book.  When you buy on Kindle, you also don't have the book jacket comments about the plot.  Therefore, I started reading without having a clue as to where the book was going.  The opening chapters are first person narratives, first from the husband, and then the wife, about their relationship and  marriage.  As far as I knew, that was what the book was about--perhaps a men are from mars, women from venus discussion of marriage from their different points of view.  So I was taken by surprise by the startling developments, which I won't recount here for fear of spoiling the read for someone else, but will say it reads more like a murder mystery.  As you continue to read the couples' first person accounts,  the inevitable conclusion is that one of them is a psychopath.  At the end there are two possible conclusions.  One is that both of them are psychopaths, and the other is that the author ended the book with a frustratingly implausible ending.  Great discussion topic.  To say more would be to spoil a really entertaining read.
B0090OW7J4|5.0|Just when you need something new and really good to listen to, here comes John Hiatt with &#34;Mystic Pinball.&#34; If you like the direction John's music has taken over the last decade, this album should rate near the top for you, too. The songs are really good (and have great variety), and his singing just keeps rolling on. I sampled with an eye toward buying and song or two and bought the whole thing.

Poor acting, poor storyline... so we thought if all else was bad, maybe the half naked guys and dancing would be okay? Nope. I still have no idea what half the women in America are going wild over! It just didn't work out for this movie.

B005Z28M58|5.0|So enjoyed this series, and loved the way almost all the loose ends were tied up in the end... and even told you the story of what happened years later.  I will miss &#34;the girls&#34;, but we all have to get on with life...  It was a Great last Season!!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I know I have watched this movie a hundred times if I've watched it once.  I've read the book and I know all the words by heart, I'm sure.  I love the era this store came from....I love the thought and dreams Jane must have had when writing it.  This book, this movie will never become old or out of date.....ever.  Generation after generation has and will love this book.  It makes me sad that Jane Austen never knew how important her work was to become, to so many; or how long her words would live on; or how many &#34;Austenites&#34; she would ultimately create.  These are Jane Austens words, written in her time, for her time....her modern day romance.  And I love her era, her interpretation of world, with her glimpses of how she felt it should change.  She wanted so badly for the women of her day to have more of a voice, more control of their destinies.  Wouldn't she be amazed if she could see us all now.
B00AE2KZNQ|3.0|was really looking forward to this movie. Had to buy it the day it came out. sad to say that the trailer is the best part.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have every movie ever made from Jane Austen material and this is by far, my favorite version of Emma.  The most fun to watch and the choice of acters better than than the others.  However I still love all the versions of Emma.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|The story is a little hard to follow in the begining trying to sort out the relationships.  However the second time when you get everyone figured out it is a delight.
1593083343|4.0|Some might think I'd be ashamed, giving to this celebrated Jane Austen novel a mere 4 stars. But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.<br /><br />Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out?  Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.<br /><br />The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she  make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.<br /><br />Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.<br /><br />Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"<br /><br />But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose.abound throughout the novel.

This is proof of the power of a good story!

Thee are two on the outside and one on the inside.  Large, medium, and skinny tips so you never have to worry about if your stylus will work.<br /><br />UPdate (09/11/2016): I see they added a clip.  Good for Amazon! The one I have has no clip so I really can't take it anywhere.

B004V5A7K8|5.0|I got so addicted to this game i would play it for hours i played it so much i beat the game within two weeks and i still play it
B0018GRAE4|5.0|As an OIF disabled Veteran, these guys really speak to me. Then the music is backed up by machine like precision heavy drums... best band ever.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Does exactly what I wanted it to. I am now able to use my two external firewire 1TB hard drives as back up devices.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Book club choice - I enjoy a young adult novel now and then - but this one far exceeded my expectations.  Don't be turned away by the sad topic - teenagers with terminal cancers - you'll find humor and LIFE in this story.  It stayed with me for days after I finished reading it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|3D is great, I have an LG 55G2 and this movie looks incredible!!  When people ask to see the 3D in action I always break this movie out, hoping The Amazing Spiderman looks this good in 3D.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Movie did not show much in my town so I went and got it. I like it. Interesting topic and love main actor!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I started watching this movie with fairly low expectations but it was surprisingly good.  The way the film was shot and the cinematography...I ended up really enjoying this film!
B003JJA59K|3.0|quality of video for streaming was excellent. movie was slow. saw book of eli and really liked it, was hoping this would be similar but it wasnt.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best one I've found!  Great to be able to 'kill time ' with one of my favs.  If I had room for only one game,  this would be it.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Brad Pitt at his finest, Jonah Hill at his finest too!  Fantastic movie which I highly recommend to anyone who really enjoys a great movie with a great storyline.  You definitely need to buy this one!
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Love this film and I love the how old films were made you don't get that quality in today's films great seller and buy
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this group and like most of the songs on this CD.  Looking forward to the release of their next album which I would definitely buy when it comes out.
B0000714BP|5.0|Oh my goodness how can one not love this movie!! I love it ad have 2 copies of this movie
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Great movie which I enjoyed very much.  Michelle Williams did a spectacular job playing Marilyn Monroe in this movie.  Very enjoyable movie and highly recommend it.
B000G759LW|5.0|Birthday gift for my sister who is a big fan of hers and he loved it. Definitely a collectors item
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|George Clooney did a spectacular job of acting in this movie.  This movie was so well acted by everyone in this movie that before yopu knew it the movie was over.  I watched this movie a few times and enjoyed it every time.  Highly recommend.
B004498KPU|5.0|This was a birthday gift for someone and they loved it very much he's a big Michael Jackson fan so u know he went crazy
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I first saw this movie on Amazon Instant Video that I downloaded.  I am glad I took the chance on watching this movie.  It is not a fast paced movie but the era the movie is portraying is not a fast paced time or area.  It did show you what bootleggers went through during the Depression to sell moonshine and the dangers they faced.<br /><br />I love movies when someone is cocky and thinks they are going to come some where and make things right and they are put in their place.  That happens in this movie.  I can not tell any more because it would give away part of the movie.<br /><br />I love the music in this movie.  Music with fiddles played in the down South fashion in the Depression era is a favorite of mine.  This movie is a must see if you like true stories about had desperate people were to make a living in the Depression.  I plan on watching it again.
B0093URN4E|5.0|As always, Converge kills it with another creative, unique and brutally heavy album.  I love if bug it may not be for everybody, some say it is an acquired taste.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is as much fun as when I play it on the computer's..  I 'm very happy that I could get it on my kindle fire .
B003ELY7PG|5.0|This book is a refreshing view on modern day business with logical, simple approach. Essential for any new entrepreneur considering starting their own business.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever. I couldn't put it down, and neither could my friend who recommened it to me. Perfect teen romance book.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I like it wasn't all hidden object. good storyline and was challenging. look forward to a sequal. wish there were more games liie this one
0525952926|5.0|A terrific follow of the first book and looking forward to third portion of the trilogy.<br /><br />Historically fascinating  about an earth -changing period of history.  Well researched and written.
0385536828|4.0|I enjoy reading Ian McEwan; this novel was just behind Atonement in overall emjoyment.  The writing, as always, was superb.
0756655307|5.0|I bought it for my kid and he really loved it; in fact he is in third grade and he takes it to school

B0050Q3UEM|5.0|If that is what you're looking for, then you will enjoy this. A ton of different channels to choose from.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was good but the ending was a bit lame. I felt it was a let down after all the twist in the book itself.
B009KHCT94|3.0|For all the hype this summer it prove to be a letdown.<br /><br />  Even Buffy the Vampire Slayer did not save it, just add to the mediocrity.<br /><br />  It vseems like they coujld not decide if it was a drama, or a comedy, and failed both ways.<br /><br />  The Germans would never have been so primitive, so uninformed.  There would have been discreet travel between Earth and the moon for supplies, materials and updating the info of what was going on the Earth.<br /><br />  figure out more for yourselves.<br /><br />  BTW: the Nazis were never that self-centered or that evil.  They were masters of mutual co-operation to achieve a common goal.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Dont get me wrong, there is an age that is too young for this movie, because there is some killin. It is worth a watch.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I borrowed this book from my local library and thought that it is one of the most beautiful and original stories I've read.  It shows that no matter what the circumstances are in someone's life they can change for the better with love and forgiveness.  I wouldn't read anything other than the book's description so you can discover this wonderful story yourself.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I didnt expect much from this movie since it is a sequel and I normally find them to be less than expected. It did surprise me and is well worth watching. It has a great story line and all the fun alien stuff you hope for in MIB movies.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Cute movie for Tinkerbell lovers. The storyline was a little weak but for 9 and under its perfect. Might be worth buying.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My daughter love this movie. Brave was a cute and smart girl. Very funny and lots of action. Will see it again
B003BH7R32|5.0|I kept hearing this song in various place this spring and sort of stopped listening to whoever I was with for a while to figure out why it was familiar.  Each time I heard it for a while, it seemed remotely familiar like I had heard it in the 1980's.  Then, I did some research and discovered a Daft Punk connection, which Instantly made sense.  This whole synth pop genre going on lately brings me back to thinking about the 1980's.  I dig this song.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great interface, excellent utility, fantastic sharing.  useful for a variety of functions.  unbelievably free, but worth getting the paid version for offline utility.  highly recommended download.
B009SCRERI|5.0|This movie is so sweet.  My two kids love it so much! They always want to watch Tinkerbell and now she has a sister! :-)  Too cute!
0670022411|5.0|I love to read.  I am usually reading one book and listening to another. Deborah E. Harkness is now my favorite other.  The way she crafted this book, and her use of dialogue, makes you want to live inside of this book.<br />She is a gifted writer.  I am now on my second book from her and still in love with the story and the characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series has me on end  reading until i can barely keep my eyes open. So excited to read the  last book and see how the end turns out!!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Very rarely do I like an album at first listen however this one I did. I only knew of the single &#34;It's Time&#34; When track one began &#34;Radioactive&#34; it immediately sucked me in. I would have loved to catch these guys when they opened for AWOLNation however the show I had a ticket for they were unable to play & the show a few nights later was sold out. I totally recommend this album (if that's what we even call them anymore?)
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book followed a rather predictable path - a promise to provide the ultimate answer to all questions of the universe, then giving a rather simplistic resolution.  But it was the trip there that was fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app but it goes to another city instead of my own. I tried several times till I gave up. I recommend this app. Not bad. I was able to toy with app and now it works at my location. I love it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games seam good for any age, but when I tried letting my little cousin try and play she couldn't. An almost 6 year old cant play your games, they need to have some simpeler.
B008SVS0K0|4.0|Their best album ever! Strong catchy tunes! Must be played loud!<br />Looking forward to seeing them live when they come to Norway
B000YABS8E|5.0|Blast From The Past brings prepping to a whole new level!<br />A good family show for movie night, over and over!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Really liked the niche this movie filled.  A realistic view of a long term relationship with no ballistic troubles but that has turned into more of a business/ roommate relationship.  Well acted by all three principals.  The same theme has been explored repeatedly in the twenty or thirty something crowd but I appreciated the different perspective of a more mature relationship.<br /><br />Please not though this is not a comedy &#34;it's complicated&#34;.  The laughs are lower key and more awkward but it rings much truer.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One page into Wool I was hooked. Hugh Howey has  created a complex, frighteningly believable, world where you are immersed in the dark, desperate life in the Silo, where hope may just be the wool that was pulled over your eyes.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Provided lots of entertainment for my 10 and 13 year olds. Gameplay is a little rough and lack of multiple saves is unfortunate.
0316223239|2.0|Had I known this entire book was narrated and essentially written by the point of view of a 5 year old I would NEVER have bought it. I have read roughly half the book and I can see where it's going and the story line but it's become almost painful to read because of how it's written. 5 year olds are not capable of book writing for a reason. I'm not even sure if I can suffering through the other half just to reach a conclusion.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I love this indestructible stylus. It even works in apps with a pen tool for writing and drawing (Paper 53). I know -- doesn't look very professional, but there's no tip to wear out, dry out, rip, or replace. Dare I mention -- it is perfect for games as well.<br /><br />Edit: Well, I do not like fingerprints all over my screen, and I still love this stylus. But I'm here to report you can wear it out. A month of too many Match 3 games, too many Angry Birds -- alas, there are worn spots on the stylus tip. Not clear through, but now it skips using Paper 53 and other apps that allow you to \\"write\\" as with a pen.<br /><br />And so -- I bought a second one to keep for non gaming use -- that's how much I still love this thing!
B001F6TXME|5.0|This cable works just fine until I dropped the camera and broke it. I use it for digiscoping and now I can keep two hands on the tripod and scope and move it and take pictures at the same time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app there are so many fun games. Some of the games are super easy and others are more of a challenge .
B009POCG2C|5.0|Good DVD- for men and women both. I always enjoy anything with Clint Eastwood and this was no exception to the rule.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Another good production from pixar.  The spunky heroine is terrific and the message of learning to accept one another as we are is very poignant and heartfelt.
B0095R64AO|5.0|Another movie made great by Emily blunt.  Jason is a good comedic actor too.<br /><br />Good supporting cast and a nice storyline, add Emily and you have success!
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|I did enjoy it.  It was worth it.  I had the original when it first came out as well.  Thanks.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It's smart, funny and romantic.<br /><br />I love Emily Blunt in everything she does - the british accent just makes her that much sweeter!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|My wife and I just enjoy this movie and it is really a classic and a great film.  It is almost a perfect transition movie that is made from a comic book story into a full length feature film.  The storyline is very good and well written and the acting is spot on with a great cast of actors.  I like Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in this movie and Alfred (Michael Caine) just plays the perfect role.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) plays the role of the new criminal mastermind who is raising chaos in the streets of Gotham.  I also liked seeing Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) again in the movie as he is always a great actor.<br /><br />The Joker's evil plans play Batman against the mob and the citizens of Gotham. The movie is filled with action and suspense and as the Joker's plans play out and you wonder how it will end.  I like this movie and have watched it several times.  I recommend it to you as a great film and if you are a Batman fan then it is a must see film.  The price of the DVD is very good and it makes it easy to add this to your collection of movies.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|I bought this to use with my Sansa MP3 player.  My Mini has a cable (factory installed) for use with an I pod.  When I tried to use it was very noisy and the volume had to be turned all the way up on the car radio to even hear anything.  I tried turning the volume up on the Sansa player with not much change.  Volume was too low to hear while driving. I ended up returning it.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|Game Play:<br />This is a colorful and challenging puzzle game. It features 112 puzzles in the game with six different levels of difficulty. The game play consists of moving the puzzle pieces around the board to allow you to move the red square to the spot where the red shaded area is on the board. The puzzle pieces are different shaped and different colors and the movements take some forethought and planning. It is a lot like moving furniture in my home.<br /><br />Changing difficulty adds more pieces and smaller pieces to the board and makes the game more challenging and fun.<br /><br />Main Screen:<br />* Sound on<br />* Play<br /><br />Play mode features:<br />* Novice<br />* Casual<br />* Standard<br />* Difficult<br />* Advanced<br />* Expert<br />* How to play<br />* Settings - change screen colors, Silent mode, SFX on, music on, hide status bar, screen transitions<br />* Recommend to a friend takes you to your email or your preferred messaging application to send a message<br />* The graph button keeps track of your statistics<br /><br />What I like:<br />I like puzzle games and this one is fun to play and challenging. The graphics are nicely done and I like the music in the background. This is a real interesting time waster while you have a few minutes to kill. It challenges your mind and it is entertaining at the same time.<br /><br />I played the game on a second generation Kindle and it had no issues. If you are trapped in the game then touch Menu in the lower LH corner and then touch the upper RH corner and a small menu will pop down. You can then touch the puzzle solution, reset the puzzle, start a new game, save and quit, view your statistics, or see the how to play section. If you touch the ? mark you get a hint for the puzzle. You can also change the game settings in the upper LH corner after touching the menu button.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />I find no complaints about this game.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a good puzzle game and worth the money to purchase it. I enjoy playing it and find it challenging and fun. The graphics and music are well done and are simple but professionally mastered. There is only one permission that stores your game play status and scores.<br /><br />There is a link to send a message to your friends about the game so if you don't want your children in your email or Facebook account then turn on the parental controls and turn off your WIFI.<br /><br />Size: The uncompressed size is 7.03 MB on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Storage - modify/delete storage contentsh the money to purchase it.

B009K45Y62|5.0|I figure I would break out for the Cowl on account this would look nice in the dvd case we have. Although this is beautiful I wish this would have been made a little more sturdy and no feel as if I am going to break it if I go to get the Blu-Rays from the base.
B004JHYRP4|4.0|The story was slow to start but I enjoyed the alternate worlds. The ending was a little abrupt. Asimov develops rich characters.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone special in my life who loves dogs & water. When I received it, I couldn't help but flip through it before wrapping it up for Christmas & let me tell you... you will smile from ear to ear! The photographs are so well taken & colorful, but the impressions on these dogs faces are what gets me. If you are having a super crappy day, all you'll need to do is look through this book & it will put in an instant smile on your face. Definitely a great gift!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The characters were very well developed. I thought this was an interesting slant on an apocalyptic scenario. I couldn't put this one down. It was gripping from beginning to end.
B009LRE040|5.0|Great streaming..looks stunning. I love being able to watch on my xbox 360 and my roku box. Makes it really easy.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I love this application. You can call it a game if you like, but it is much better than that.  It is true, it is a little difficult at first and does require using more than one finger, but then so does playing the piano.<br />I purchased Piano Master - the full version, with no previous piano training and it does take that long to &quot;master&quot; the songs I found I loved. Christmas songs should be even easier since most people grew up with most of these.<br />I look forward to hours of enjoyment and so should you.
B000001Y79|5.0|Got the product in no time in fact it arrived quicker than I thought.<br />I had forgotten that I purchased it new so when it came shrink wrapped I was pleasantly surprised!<br />This is going to make a perfect Christmas gift!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Love this movie had one before and got ruined my  3 year old grandson never moved through the whole movie it was very cute and peaceful:)
B006N0YWGY|5.0|BEST MOBILE GAME EVER!!!!!! THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! SO ADDITIVE!!!! CANT PUT IT DOWN!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE!!!!!!!!
1400052181|5.0|A fascinating story, brilliantly told, weaving a science story in with a rich, empathetic, personal family history. It couldn't have been better, and few could have made this the great book it turned out to be.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another good book by one one my favorite writers. He never dissapoints me.  DeMille adds humor to his works and I enjoy it.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Ok, I may not like the new Trek as much as the old Trek, but this is a great movie and the ensemble they've pulled together for the reboot has a lot of promise! I'm glad to have a copy of this to add to my Trek collection.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|this movie is just OK, glad I rented it instead of spending $10. I was hoping for more, the commercials were good, the movie is OK, should have been better
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|This is a great classic Christmas movie that is fun for all ages.  It's always fun to see Macaulay Culkin from back in the day.  Enjoy...
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|Bunch of oooold guys wtih way too much make up trying to relive the glory days.  Statham still has some appeal and Li is kinda like Dick Clark in that he never ages.  Otherwise, dialog was cheesy, Stallone's moves looked more like Paul Blart Mall Cop than Rambo, Schwartzenegger, Norris and Van Dam need botox desperately and the story line is soooo far out there it's completely unbelievable.<br /><br />The action and gore is so over-the-top and unrealistic it's pathetic.  Great advertisement opportunity for Ensure, Geritol and Depends though.<br /><br />Sly, the steroids are taking a toll, hang it up buddy, time to enjoy the grandkids.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Easy, engaging read. Great retrospective look on life. Well developed characters in a storyline with such touching moments it makes you want to read more.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think this game is super fun! Its fun for little kids and everybody! you get to buy cool houses and places for your animals to play with!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Received my order before promised date of arrival. Haven't open nor played the CD as of yet because it's a X-Mas present; but, I am happy to have it before Christmas and hopefully be Happy with the quality of it's sound but unable to be determine until X-mas Eve.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love when the good guy doesnt hold back. No second guessing, just out right force.. Great movie to watch.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I love Star Trek and definitely think that they did a good job remaking it. The actors were a great choice for the characters they played as well.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a really good app and i hope other people like it i know my little sister loved it in every way
B009SQRL4U|5.0|It was a cute Christmas movie and would watch it again. My 5 year old loved it, I think she would watch it over and over again.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|theory of a deadman is awesome and this cd is no exception. i have it in my car and listen to it daily
B0053O89KG|5.0|I gave it five stars because that's all Amazon allotted.The cast is platinum moving crisply through episodic action with well-balanced humor and drama. Basically a crime of the week premise, it is also a love story. And just as criminal investigations rarely run smoothly, neither does the quest for love. Nathan Fillion has more natural charisma than the law allows and in the persona of wealthy, best-selling author Richard Castle the scripts give him wide latitude in exploring all facets of that personality. Stana Katic's Kate Beckett (my god, she's gorgeous) over the four seasons and into the fifth has matched facet for facet those of Castle. Beckett is yin to Castle's yang - and may well be the strongest series character leads going.The support players have strength and depth in their own rights and all meld well creating a solid tapestry to provide enjoyable episode after episode. So, what's not to love? Maybe that they only do 22 or 23 episodes per season?
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I definitely enjoy the game. I don't particularily enjoy that that you come to a standstill and to really do much you have to purchase from the shop to continue. getting gems is hard enough but when ive gotten a couple for leveling and a couple from the balloon pop game... they never showed up o. my total, making it pretty much impossible to make your way in the game. I hope this &quot;not recieving the gems you earn show up on your total&quot; gets fixed. it worked just fine until this recent update. now I can even attempt to get along on my own in the game. other then that and the movement glitches on the applendrop game (movement seems to spas in the beggining on the game) its rather fun to play if you need to kill a few minutes. nothing spectacular though.
B000002AQQ|3.0|I am impress with how fast shipping was and was really excited about getting this cd because it had all of the songs from the movie which I absolutely love but it was little but damaged annd I was expecting a brand new cd. Overall it's great but I wish it was new
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love this game it is so fun and has amazing quality for being free!! I wish there were more games like this in the appetite!
0525953728|3.0|I believe this is an amazing story but I just could not get absorbed in the facts, my husbamd loved it and I gave it to a teen age grandson for his library collection....
0385344228|5.0|This is SUCH a great book! I haven't read anything this great in a VERY long time. I have been recommending it to everyone. Great suspense.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is awesome, very exciting and keeps you wanting more. Way better than the first season. Everyone should watch this show.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Not as good as the first two movies. Where is the pug? and where are all the other alien creatures? The story line sags without them.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|THE CD DOES NO JUSTICE VERSUS THE LIVE PERFORMANCE OF &#34;SOLDIER'S ANGEL&#34;.  I REALLY FEEL THIS SONG SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED 9/11/2011 ON THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11.  THE UNITED STATES IS SEEING CASUALTIES OF WAR AND THE INJURED RETURN HOME TO THE U S, BUT NOT MAYBE TO THEIR HOME OR WHERE HOME IS IN THEIR HEART.  I DO THINK THE PRODUCERS COULD HAVE 'ENERGIZED' STEVIE NICK'S TASTE AND STYLE OF PERFORMANCE, LIKE SHE IS KNOWN FOR BY PRODUCING SOME FAST-PACED SONGS.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend. Is his favorite movie. Luckily I found it here since stores here dont sell this anymore.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!  I was left hanging do I had to move on to the second book! The book brings you in and keeps your attention, but beware of the language and lots of steamy sex
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am very biased, as DeMille is by far my favorite author. He really knows how to spin a yarn. He keeps you furiously turning pages with his twisted plot and his use of wit and sarcasm.
B0041KVXLK|4.0|I am not the hard core Beatles fan, but I can see how this is way overdone in the remaster.  The stereo mixing sounds like what might have happened when they first discovered stereo, bouncing around all over the place for no good reason.  The vinyl is fantastic, clean and quiet as a mouse.  Great fidelity, too, its just that I hate the mix.  I will not buy any more from the set until they do it in mono
034580404X|5.0|It is a very interesting trilogy to say the least! Once you start reading it, it's hard to put down(I don't want to give anything away)I think this is a good read! Anyone I have talked to who has read it also agree......
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show! My family looks forward to it every week. The writers of the series do a great job of keeping the audience entertained, surprised, and wanting more!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I was looking for a travel alarm for my phone and kindle. This works great, but be sure to turn your volume up before you go to bed. A simple no frills app.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|I haven't watched some of the others on this subject yet...but LOVED THIS ONE! Kevin Costner is a favorite of mine and he was PERFECT in this one, as usual as far as I'm concerned!
0765316994|2.0|I originally bought the book in hopes that it was a Star Trek spin off of some sort. It was not - in any way. Its a shame that most of the bad reviews are written by people who admitted to not having the patience to finish reading the codas. I found the codas (actually mostly the 2nd and 3rd - the 1st was a waste of time) to be excellent. In fact, the author should have scrapped the entire first 280 pages of horrible nonsense he wrote and simply started the book with the second Coda. It was the first time in the entire book that I actually cared about the dialogue and the characters.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Cool book. Most of the information covered were stuff that I already have known or heard, but this is a great book for beginners. I can truly agree that if you folks this regimen, that you will succeeded (just like other plans).<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Yes! Very easy to understand.<br />Was it worth MY money? I don't think so. I already knew most of the stuff but it's still informative though.<br />I would ask for a refund if I can, but I don't think it's righteous after finishing the book.<br /><br />Beginners: get this book and be dedicated!<br />More experienced: it will be a hit or miss

B002RT69QQ|5.0|This one worked right out of the box just as I needed it to. Very impressive and it outdid all my other readers hands down.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|A hodge-podge of violence with a thoroughly illogical plot.  The movie doesn't try to hide that it makes no sense.  The action isn't particularly inventive and so doesn't make up for stupidity.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Was excited to see this movie and thought the cast would be great. The plot drags on in too many places and generally goes no where. Soundtrack is excellent.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|I thought the movie was an insult to the dancers.. unless that is the way their world is.  Not one that I would recommend for future dancers - which are children -- good Lord.  Have you all lost your minds!!!  Natalie -- you would take your talent and debase it this way.  Sad--
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Not my favorite Wes Anderson film, but I really enjoyed it. Love the cast and plot. Soundtrack is excellent as always. Wouldn't suggest renting this if you aren't a Wes Anderson film fan.
B009VB97EY|1.0|It was hard to watch it was so bad.  I skipped ahead and almost just stopped the whole thing.  Wow, don't bother....Channing has a great body but this movie is not worth your time.

B004GVUPFE|3.0|I prefer versions where scoring is based on the total number of pieces moved.  This one appears to score based on how many squares each piece is moved.<br /><br />Also, I don't see any way of replaying a stage (to try to earn a lower score) after completing it.

B0090EJR1K|4.0|this was pretty funny. i found sasha cohen's first movie, borat, totally hilarious. one of the funniest movies i've seen in a theatre. not sure if his style of comedy sort of gets old after a while, but it was still funny just not insanely funny. i don't know if i would buy it. might be better to wait till it comes to amazon prize instant video or netflix. oh wait can i say netflix on here??

1401322786|1.0|The Time Keeper, held a promise never fulfilled.I read it on a flight, yet it was so thin, one dimensional, characters were so basic that i preferred to listen to the humm of the flight than finish the book. Everything about this book was stereotypical,trying to be deep but somehow leaving you deflated and wanting to get something out of the time you spent reading it!

B000PC0U1W|5.0|Awesome movie! Don't start the Revolution without.  Notice how your own Government RIGHT NOW isn't too far off from this one in the movie.

0375869026|5.0|Subject matter, style, insight into everyday life for a special child were all positives.<br />I have bought several copies of this book for my children and grandchildren and have had good feedback from them also.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I found the opening of the movie quite stupid.  It did get better throughout the movie. However it's probably not one I'll watch again, unless the world ends and I'm the only one that survived and I found a copy of MIB 3.
B009LRE040|3.0|I don't know what it was about this one.  Maybe it was the pacing, maybe it was the motivations of the antagonists, or maybe it was just the general concepts, unanswered questions, or slightly rushed ending but I just can't get excited about this film.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining to watch, and I'm not sorry I rented it.  It just felt like it was missing something in comparison to the previous two.  I did like how they brought the trilogy full circle and tied it all together with a bitter-sweet ending though.<br /><br />In concluding this review I'd say I like Subway sandwiches, and I really like a full steak dinner with potatoes and red wine.  Both have their place and will be dinner from time to time.  If the previous movies were juicy porterhouses this movie was more of a sandwich sans pickles.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|The film has no plot or anything, but if you go in with low expectations, it's at least entertaining to watch. Dancing is neat.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|I like the bleak future setting, the oppressive government taking advantage of the conditions, and the fight choreography was very much worth the watch.  I was entertained for the entire movie.  I even liked Bale in this more than in the final Batman movie.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Seriously, from the previews you think Liam is gonna be balls deep in wolves for most of the movie. Nope, it's just a bunch of guys hiking in the woods, and a wolf visits occasionally. Just watch taken.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best of the Batman movies.  And not just of the Christian Bale movies, but out of all of the movies dating back to Michael Keaton's.  What a way to finish the story began in \\"Batman Begins\\"!<br /><br />As I have stated in my movie reviews, the best stories are those driven both by plot and by character.  To some extent, this particular one is more character-driven than its predecessors.  But, do not assume that the plot is secondary.  Both are given equal attention here.  And what a masterful job from director Christopher Nolan, who also co-wrote the screenplay.  Obviously, this is a high-budget movie, and as such, the production quality, and the stuff that make you think \\"wow\\" are all beyond reproach.  The special effects and the sets are the best that money can buy.  The Batman's toys and high-tech support are all here.  But this movie is really about Bruce Wayne, much more so than the Batman or his high-tech arsenal.  The story that began in the first movie has now come full-circle, and builds up to an awe-inspiring, surprising, and fitting finale.<br /><br />The story picks up eight years after the second movie.  Batman, with the help of Gordon, has taken the blame for the death of Harvey Dent.  The death of Harvey Dent spurred the people of Gotham to pull together to enact some rather draconian laws in order to fight the criminal elements.  Eight years of very, very aggressive tactics have cleaned up the city.  Gotham is a safe and a peaceful place to live in.  Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has been living a very reclusive life, holed up in his mansion.  Detached from Gotham society and his company, the billionaire has allowed his business adversaries to gain a foothold within the board rooms of Wayne Enterprises.<br /><br />Meanwhile, beneath the city streets, in the sewers, Bane has been putting plans together to take over the city.  This Bane has a mysterious connection to Bruce Wayne's past.  As Bane's power starts to grow, Bruce realizes that he is now a  threat to Gotham and must be stopped.  Alfred, ever mindful of Bruce's broken body, pleads with him not to don the cape again.  The loyal Alfred frankly tells Bruce that he is now past his prime and tells him that he can not hope to beat Bane in a fight.  Alfred tells him not to confront Bane.  Bruce stubbornly decides to get back in physical shape so that Batman could rise once again and save the city.  Unwilling to have to be the one to bury Bruce, Alfred decides to quit his job and leave the mansion.<br /><br />Now alone, Bruce meets up with the mysterious burglar, Selina Kyle.  Gordon is in the hospital, recovering from a run-in with Bane's thugs.  A young policeman named Blake has managed to work out the true identity of Batman and pays Bruce a visit.  At Wayne Enterprises, the ambitious board member Daggett has worked out a plan with Bane that would give him control of the company and all of Bruce's assets.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, we see Bruce Wayne brought down to as low as a man could go.  Without his wealth, health, and gadgets, he must find a way to rescue Gotham from Bane and his thugs.  Yes, I agree with one of my fellow reviewers who said that this one has a slower pace than the previous two movies.  And that is primarily because the attention here is on Bruce and what happens to him.  This is the character-driven part of the story.  Watching this, you cannot help but feel sorry for him.  This movie will make you care about this character and will make you really root for him as he brings himself back up from the pit of despair.<br /><br />Nolan really gave Christian Bale an opportunity to shine as an actor in this movie.  We know Bale is good.  We've watched him since he was a teenager in \\"Empire of the Sun\\".  But now, with this movie, he has established himself as one of the best actors out there.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt played Blake.  Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle.  Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are both back for their respective parts, along with Morgan Freeman.  And Tom Hardy plays the very scary Bane.<br /><br />Ok, yes this is a movie about a superhero.  But this is not anything like Ironman.  Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark are as different as two people can be.  And this movie is dark and weighty, not light-hearted like the Ironman movies.  Both franchises are good, both of the lead actors are terrific.  But the tone of the films are as different as night and day.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best movies this year, perhaps second only to \\"Prometheus\\", in the humble opinion of your reviewer.  I rented this movie from XBox, but you can also rent it from Playstation and from here.  If there is a movie worth having on your Blu-Ray library collection though, this would be near the top of the list.  This is one of those movies that would make a great addition to any respectable Blu-Ray or DVD collection.pective parts, along with Morgan Freeman.

B0083GQKQG|3.0|From an objective point of view, this movie is really pretty solid. Good acting, camera work, solid plot, pacing, all the stuff--I just didn't really like it. Sorry.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Without giving away the movie, it is well done remake on the classic text. No, it doesn't perfectly follow the book, but the cinematic art is well-done. The actors and actresses are very convincing, and I can watch this over and over again.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had originally preordered this film from amazon, but had seen in an ad for albertsons it was cheaper there and had free chips and popcorn that came with it. YUM! I saw this movie in theaters and 10 minutes in I knew I wanted to read the books and buy this as soon as it came out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So great to get recipes, DIY ideas, fashion, travel...anything & everything!! Pinterest is the best. Who cares about Facebook anymore??

B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I love historical recordings, and these are great. If you insist on CD quality, you really miss a lot. I really like the CD sized hard bound booklet (3/4&#34; thick) liner notes, This large volume of music is hard to beat for the price.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Like most Vince Flynn readers, I'm always anxious for the next Mitch Rapp novel.  After the previous edition, which offered insight into Mitch's past, I welcomed a return to the no-hold-barred Mitch of the present.  This story line even offered some interesting twists in Mitch's personality.  I thought it was great, as evidenced by my being unable to put the book down until I finished it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Highly recommend this series!  The video quality is great, and I will continue buying episodes once they air due to my busy schedule.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Heroes coming together, putting aside differences to face a common foe, great entertaining theme.  The actors did a good job with the material.

B007SGM084|4.0|Okay, I purchased these books because all of my friends were talking about Christian Gray on FB and Pinterest. . .I found myself start to skimming over several of the pages that were just a bit too much in the sexual S&M for my taste. . .I think they would be better if some of it was cut out. . .it was a lot of repeating the same &#34;sex stuff&#34; over and over. . .the story line was entertaining and good. . .<br /><br />Would not recommend it for anyone under 25 though. . .
B002RB7VMA|5.0|How can you beat Michael Buble'? I love his voice, his older style of music made contemporary. Another great album!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I stayed up all night reading this book - I was soooooo tired the next day, but it was totally worth it!  I work in the legal field, and have for 25 years, and I just love the accuracy of the law, and the roller coaster of emotions . . .terrific book!  I can't wait for the next one!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|The whole series was very well written, it will let you get absorbed into the story. Buy it, Read it.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|I got this for my five year old daughter and it is way too easy to unknowingly purchase items for the cafe. I was charged $30 for nothing.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Spending the $3 is worth it because so much is unlocked! Even without upgrading it is fun.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|What a surprise this video was...I am a Jane Austen fan and have most renditions of Pride and Prejudice, but when I viewed this video, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they could pull off such a different interpretation that was so fun to watch.  And of course, I added it to my collection.

B0083P1QUM|1.0|This was my last Patricia Cornwell book.  The strong female lead has changed into an intolerable woman who lacks self-confidence, plus the sexual component with the younger man... really!!<br /><br />I struggled through “Red Mist”, I hoped that “Bone Bed” would be like the first Kay Scarpetta novels, but it was unbearable, just like the main character.

B008DL466C|3.0|Wiz Khalifa had a breakout album with 2011's [[ASIN:B004LFO0ME Rolling Papers]], propelled by no. 1 Grammy-nominated hit, \\"Black and Yellow.\\" He follows up that breakout effort and a mixtape ([[ASIN:B007RC52SY Taylor Allderdice]]) with 2012's [[ASIN:B008DL466C O.N.I.F.C.]]. O.N.I.F.C. doesn't possess the same zest of Rolling Papers, suffering from overindulgence and being overstuffed at over 73 minutes.  17 Tracks long, Cuts could and should've been made by Wiz/producers, isolating the strongest cuts like \\"The Bluff,\\" \\"Work Hard, Play Hard,\\" \\"Remember You,\\" and \\"Medicated.\\" There are sufficient cuts aside from these, but even promo single \\"Work Hard, Play Hard\\" is no \\"Black and Yellow,\\" Stargate producing or not.  Ultimately, O.N.I.F.C. is nothing better than average and never triumphs the likes of stronger 2012 rap albums like Kendrick Lamar's [[ASIN:B00913P6G0 Good Kid: M.A.A.D City [Deluxe Edition]]] or even Meek Mill's sometimes flawed but promising [[ASIN:B008M4HC66 Dreams & Nightmares]].<br /><br />Honestly, the \\"Intro\\" may be the first bad sign as :40 of instrumental leave the listener ultimately saying to themselves, \\"so what?\\" \\"Paperbound\\" saves as the first full length cut, finding Wiz bragging about his excess of money and his substance habits. \\"Paperbound\\" is at best a 'B,' leaving the listener less intelligent than they felt prior to partaking in \\"Paperbound.\\" \\"Bluffin'\\" doesn't atone, with Khalifa bragging on the hook: \\"I got so much money I think I should pay for all this/they ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'...\\" Even Christopher \\"Drumma Boy\\" Gholson's production is less notable than usual on the average cut. The Akon featuring \\"Let It Go\\" is slightly more notable, but Akon sounds less than enthused on the hook, failing to add much pizzaz. The production is solid nonetheless, giving an ok \\"Let It Go\\" some redemption.<br /><br />\\"The Bluff,\\" featuring Cam'ron is the best cut at the front of the album. ID Labs delivers lush production work of which both Wiz and Cam'ron deliver.  Wiz doesn't change his message, but at least it's more convincing on \\"The Bluff.\\" Similarly, \\"Work Hard, Play Hard\\" is none too shabby, even if it falls quite short of the grandeur of \\"Black and Yellow.\\" \\"Work Hard, Play Hard\\" benefits from its hook: \\"The bigger the bill, the harder you ball/well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long...work hard play hard,\\" etc.<br /><br />\\"Got Everything\\" featuring Courtney Noelle marks an upswing, as does the mysterious production on \\"Fall Asleep,\\" a cut produced by @PopWansel, @Oakwud, and @Flippa123.  Again, it is not messaging as Wiz doesn't change anything, but the music coupled with Wiz's approach at times on this particular cut makes \\"Fall Asleep\\" worthwhile.  \\"Time\\" is forgettable, with Wiz referencing his favorite crop while \\"It's Nothing\\" finds Drumma Boy delivering capable production for a rather dumb song. The hook is as minimalist as Drumma Boy's slinky production: \\"It's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing/stackin' cheese till my bread right...did it all on my own so I'mma spend all my bread like, it's nothin...\\" Pretty simplistic and unintelligible.  2 Chainz certainly doesn't heighten the intellect.<br /><br />\\"Rise Above\\" features Pharrell (who also produces), Tuki Carter & Amber Rose.  The production is signature Pharrell, perhaps the best characteristic of the track. Amber Rose's outtro caps off the utter ridiculousness of much of the album and the cut itself.  She manages another spot at the end of \\"Initiation,\\" a cut that more prominently features Lola Monroe, a female rapper that sounds quite similar to one Nicki Minaj.  Khalifa tells producer Sledgren that \\"he's stupid for this one,\\" though perhaps Khalifa should have referred to himself. \\"This is for them Taylors... Yeah I got it, so I flaunt it/and I bought it cause I want it,\\" he proclaims on the hook.  Maybe Lola Monroe's trash talk serves as the highlight, if there is one here.<br /><br />\\"Up In It\\" has lush production (Jim Jonsin, Earl & E, and Rico Love) on its side. \\"No Limit\\" is well produced but at nine and a half minutes, it is 'way too much.' \\"The Plan,\\" featuring Juicy J. is more accessible, though still overindulges in that ugly thing called 'repetition.' The two best cuts grace the end, just one of the many qualms that is O.N.I.F.C. \\"Remember You,\\" featuring The Weeknd is emo and moody just like Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd) likes it.  Concluding cut \\"Medicated,\\" featuring Chevy Woods & Juicy J, features superb production by Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills and solid rhymes by Wiz and the guest artists.  Even if the album starts off incredibly bumpy, Khalifa manages to close it capably.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008DL466C O.N.I.F.C.]] is just so-so.  It has its good moments, but fails to 'captivate' or truly 'wow.' On future efforts, Wiz will need to focus more and broaden his style, approach, and most important, his rhymes. The lack of truly memorable cuts aside from a few notable ones really hurts this effort. 3 stars is kind.br />\\"Up In It\\" has lush production (Jim Jonsin, Earl & E, and Rico Love) on its side. \\"No Limit\\" is well produced but at nine and a half minutes, it is 'way too much.' \\"The Plan,\\" featuring Juicy J. is more accessible, though still overindulges in that ugly thing called 'repetition.'

B00ABGEFWC|2.0|this is one of those addicting games. stuff that wants you to play like, every five minutes. i used to have it, but dis installed it shortly after. im disappointed with this game. i used to LOVE lps! o.o

B007EDYN36|5.0|Peter Criss has always been my favorite member of KISS and to read his story of his history with the band and the ups and downs of his life is truly inspiring.  A great book to read even if you aren't a KISS fan!  Highly recommended!
B00993FEUK|5.0|I saw this film in the theater on the premier night in 3-D. The 3D was amazing. Not gimmicky, not just thrown in as an excuse to charge more for admission. AMAZING. I wanted to wait until I actually owned the product which is the home video release before I review. Notice verified purchase. The menu is using Universal Studies generic menu which, I am not crazy about as I like a custom menu. That aside, the BD transfer quality is top notch. You could see all the details Laika studios pays attention too like the pattern in the concrete, and the clothing the characters wore. The video quality is comparable to the theater. I want to get a  3D tv so I can watch movies like this in 3D at home.<br /><br />Story<br />A kid from a  small town with a dark history is a medium, he see's dead people. He is also weird and misunderstood by everyone but his friend Neil. The story has great messages about bullying and tolerance. I don't want to spoil it, but I saw it with 4 year and 6 year old. The 6 year got the message, the 4 year old not so much. Mildly scary in some scene, but nothing an intelligent child cannont handle.<br /><br />Visuals<br /><br />Laika!, The studio that brought use Coraline and Corpse Bride. This is the best stop motion animation I have ever seen. They were hired by Tim Burton and formed their own studio. I believe the first film to utilize a 3D printer for the film. I read in the Wired article Norman alone has something like 9000 separate faces, with over 300 hand sculpted hairs. Ridiculous attention to detail. They also used an advance process for the 3D shooting multiple frames with a high end Nikkon SLR. At the theater I was blown away by the 3D. I also love the story. A modern take on issues such as bullying and tolerance.<br /><br />Special Features/Extra's<br />Will followup on this, with an update, Remember this is a Home video/ Blu Ray review not a film review.

B005SJIP2S|5.0|In The Present Yes's most recent live release in nothin short of a treasure. The performances are brilliant.While I would have asked for a more adventerous set list everything else simply falls into place. Vocalist Benoit breaths life into these rock classics. Delivering the songs more like a rock vocalist instead of a whispy voiced elf. All the yes longtime stalwarts top themselves as well. Just simply magic.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Such a great cd from the first song to the last.  The more I listen to it the more I love it. You wont be disappointed!

B0069JBKHI|4.0|I've only had this monitor for 2 days so my review is based on my experience of the past 48 hours.  To be honest, I was a bit afraid of purchasing this since I've read some reviews about connectivity issues.  However, there aren't many choices out there which allows remote connection from outside of your home so I took a gamble and I must say that so far I am pleasantly surprised on how well it works.<br /><br />1st, I am not the geekiest person in the world, I am a 34 yr old working mom, do know a little about computers/networks.  I've actually set up the monitor (in less than 10 min) without any help from Hubby. I do want to mention that for those of you experiencing dropped connections over wifi, you may want to try assigning Static IPs on each device that has access to your WiFi.  Currently, we have more than 10 various devices (computers/laptops/tablet/iPhones/PS3,Wii,XBox, etc) accessing our home WiFi network and in the past we've encountered &#34;hand-shake&#34; issues when allowing the router to randomly assign IPs (we would loose connections on these devices).  After doing some research, we switched to a method which we assigned a unique IP address for each device that's connected to our WiFi and we have not encounter any issues since then.<br /><br />I also downloaded the BETA version of the Android app on my Sony Tablet and the only time I lost connection is when I place the tablet back on the cradle for charging.  This is not a huge issue for me since I typically have the Sony Tablet in the cradle next to my bed and as long as it is continuously in the cradle, I don't loose connections.<br /><br />I've also tested the iPhone app over 4G network while I was out doing some shopping, again no connection issue and I can see my baby just fine (though video quality is a bit lower than WiFi).<br /><br />Also, you can have multiple devices accessing the Video/Audio feed at the same time which is a very nice feature.  This allows me and hubby to monitor our son while the both of us are at work in separate locations.<br /><br />Recommendations to Withings:  Please allow us to manually control IR via the app, this can probably done through a simple software update.hile the both of us are at work in separate locations.<br /><br />Recommendations to Withings:  Please allow us to manually control IR via the app, this can probably done through a simple software update.
0345803485|4.0|I normally don't review anything, books or otherwise, but having read the polarized reviews and had to weigh in.<br /><br />Of course Christian is beautiful, wealthy, a talented pianist, well endowed AND flies a helicopter - it's a love STORY. If I wanted reality, I'd read the newspapers! The sex scenes are not overly repetitive, but varied even. The inner goddess is a hoot!<br /><br />It is certainly not shocking to me that there are virgins still out there at the ripe old age of 21! I know many - and they are not ogres or crazies.<br /><br />Because of all the erotic hype I bought the book and was pleasantly surprised there was an actual love story.<br />Not classic literature in the least, but I was not looking for one!

B0076DCT2G|1.0|I had always enjoyed the cocky and witty John Corey. In this book he is not smart and I got bored of his childish comments which came way too often to be funny or clever. I did not believe in his character and more importantly, did not like or care for him
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte were the second place winners of the Britains got Talent show.  They were wonderful~  Their audition was amazing.  Simon Cowell produced this album and put them under contract.  They will be touring in the spring.  Hopefully they will come to the US soon.<br /><br />The album is excellent.  Contains the songs they sang in the competition as well as others.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />Anyone interested in seeing and hearing their audition video can type their name in their browser and all information will come up.  Worth listening to.

0316228532|4.0|As in the Potter series, Rowling is telling a story of prejudice and collusion. Good wins out - after a fashion. But the journey is grittier and more believable. It wasn't as much fun as Potter. Is it an accurate look at not-so-merry-old-England?
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Super small and slim MicroSD reader that has been performing well.  Only half height USB, so it does not take nearly as much space on a keychain.  Used this to replace one that died after 5 years of living on my keychain with no special treatment whatsoever.<br /><br />The fabric does tend to wear off of the small strings connecting it to the keychain, but the plastic interior of those cables seems to be close to indestructible.

B009VSW15Y|3.0|I was not too happy with this purchase because I believed that the camera was  front and back--it is only front which makes it very hard taking pictures.  Even though pictures taken are of high quality I would have liked to have an aperture in the back to make taking pictures easier.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season kept me wanting more.  The mid season cliff hanger...Arrgghh... can't wait to see what happens.  Season 3 is much like season 1 which is excellent mix of story and character development.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This series is brilliant, but Mr. Martin appears to have an advanced case of &#34;flight of ideas&#34; introducing and killing off new characters almost every chapter. This series is brilliant but the author first said he was going to complete it in 5 books, then 6, now I read somewhere that he is going to need 7 BOOKS !!!! Please Sir, bring this to a close, I'd like to see a conclusion before I die !!!

1439152802|4.0|Author of The Distant Hours, and other bestsellers, Kate Morton again draws the reader into the years around WWII in England where turmoil reigns and the future of the country and personal lives seems so very unsure. It all begins when Laurel Nicholson is sitting in her tree house as a young girl and is debating whether or not to run into the kitchen of her house to get the \\"birthday knife\\" the family uses to cut all celebratory cakes. Instead she sees a man approach the house, followed by her mother coming outside, sharing words with the man who seems to know her, and then an action that haunts Laurel up to the time of her recounting this story to the reader.  That scene is never spoken of by Laurel, her mother, or her much younger brother who was also present but dramatically affects their lives. Now Laurel wants to know the truth about the mystery behind the secret and sets to finding out what really happened that life-changing day so long ago!<br /><br />Now it's time for Laurel's mother, Dorothy's 90th birthday party.  Dorothy is not always so lucid and she occasionally mutters names that none of the family seem to know but which Laurel cannot get her to expand on in conversation. Laurel is a famous actress now and has a hard time doing interviews about her past because of her previous memories. It also turns out her baby brother remembers more than she thinks he does, but she doesn't want to traumatize him by revealing more, at least at first. As she begins to look a bit deeper by tracking down the people or acquaintances of the main players in this mystery, she finds that her mother had a secret life in London during WWII when she was deeply in love with a boy named Jimmy Metcalfe, someone who later became a famous photographer in Europe during the war.  She was also good friends with a woman named Vivien Jenkins.  Somehow something occurred that caused a break in their friendship.  Who was the betrayer and why?  How was that associated with her mother's devastating act seen by Laurel.<br /><br />Kate Morton portrays war-torn England and the \\"desperate\\" nature of relationships with style and gripping tension that immediately snare the reader into rapidly flipping pages to find out the answer to numerous questions.  It's an era many young readers might not relate to yet one that is intriguing for its private wars that mirror the global battles of this second \\"war to end all wars.\\" Great writing and a riveting historical fiction read!stating act seen by Laurel.<br /><br />Kate Morton portrays war-torn England and the \\"desperate\\" nature of relationships with style and gripping tension that immediately snare the reader into rapidly flipping pages to find out the answer to numerous questions.

B0086700CM|3.0|never played it, never opened it.  It was not being used so I uninstalled it to make room for something I WOULD use.  No review (technically) but I'm trying to clear these out.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. The plot was not what you would have guessed from the preview, but it was also a little one-dimensional. Had a little trouble with the rental process, but it got sorted out right away. The customer service representative was very helpful.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Decided why use up memory in the tablet when I can just as easily access amazon through my pc?  No problems, just didn't want to waste the limited storage space.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This is great movie!  I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes Japanese anime.  One of Miyazaki's best films!
B009MF56GC|3.0|I liked the movie mostly because the old gang is back in action. The problem I had was with the amount of graininess (mosquito noise) throughout the video. I read through most of the reviews and didn't see any mention of it. This makes me wonder if it might be my Blu-Ray player (it is an Oppo!). Anyone else experience this???
B00AI7G2YS|1.0|I downloaded this book to my Kindle for iPad app, and the majority of the pages between pages xvi and 199 were blank, no images no text. Amazon refunded my money and said that they would pull the book to make sure it was corrected before relisting. However it appears that they never removed the book so beware and be forewarned.<br /><br />Mike Rohde does great work, just something was definitely wrong with the Kindle version / copy I downloaded this past week. I'm ready to purchase the Kindle copy again once I know the problem that I had is fixed.<br /><br />I will gladly revise my review when the kindle version is corrected, but again I don't want someone else running into the same issue I had.
B003VW8GT6|4.0|John Wayne at his best. This is a good old western drama. The mountains, the desert, the storms with lots of bad guys and Indians.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I normally don't write a lot of reviews for movies, but I had to here.  I rented it because I seriously thought it would be bad.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  More so actually.  If you're looking for a movie that makes fun of the 80's styles, but still has great music, this is the movie for you.  Be prepared to be wowed by the soundtrack and good singing by all and laugh because of the \\"over the top\\" stuff that goes on.  Definitely a good watch -- especially for those of us that remember the 80's.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|This app is fine, but the streamer software that you are required to use on your desktop is a horribly baggy piece of garbage.  When it finds an update it pops up over everything, including restoring full screen movies.  I am uninstalling all of it and would reccomend a free vnc viewer and server instead.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|We've been watching this from Season One to Season Seven. It's truly awesome. Every season just gets better. You'll love all seven seasons from beginning to end. Don't miss any of them.
0312641893|5.0|I gobbled this book up very quickly.  I loved the characters, loved the story line, just loved it. It was interesting  how the main character Cinder went about her days, met up with the adorable prince, and how the author interwined the original story with the classic cinderella tale.  Can't wait for the sequel.  I think the only other books I've read that were sci-fi and enjoyed would be The Host and Starters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is the best.  This one is a winner and keeps you on your toes.  Twist and turns galore!  A great stocking stuffer.

B008W14ZD2|5.0|I really like this new album.  It is definitely an evolved sound from some earlier releases, but I really like the diversity of sound.  Stand outs from this album for me are Good Time, Dreams and Disasters, and Metropolis.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie will have you laughing. It is great for the whole family. My daughters family watch it every year all together. A family tradition. I recommend it
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I hope that they get together and start making a TV series staring the same actors.  Expensive but it would pay in the end, as no one else has ever brought the caricatures alive as has the current stars.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Good cinematography with strong performances from the cast, in particular Cherlize Theron.  Interesting storyline and very different from the Snow White fairy tail we grew up with.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Can only say that this movie was above and beyond my expectations.  My wife hates sci fi but loved this movie!  Epic!
B001706I5I|5.0|One of my favorite's, and even better on blu ray! Jim Carrey is great in this movie! Don't miss out!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 of the Walking Dead is terrifying and makes up for what I feel was lacking in the previous season. They are no longer sitting around safe in consumed by some melodramatic drama with hopefully a chance of seeing a &#34;walker&#34;. This is an all out homage to the actual series. People die left and right, there is action, a feeling of uneasiness, and oodles of cliff-hangers to enjoy.<br /><br />Somehow the Walking Dead is able to capture this world of absolutely no hope in such a lucid way that I can't help but recommend this season to anyone. Especially if you were like me and started to lose hope during the lackluster season 2.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This is a fun Lego set to put together. I got this for $335, best deal ever! My husband loves it!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I loved this movie, but I really think that there needs to be a sequel, and Ridley Scott needs to just officially make this a prequel to Alien.
B0099114WO|1.0|This movie was a disgrace for such talented stars.  I was totally disgusted with the movie<br />and very disappointed and surprised at the rating.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|That's all there is to say about. Just when you think it's reached the pinnacle of intensity - the writers jack it up a notch. Outstanding series.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|An amazing tale.  Clever, imaginative and thought-provoking.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  Piscine was an innovative character with a gentle yet determined nature and he had a great sense of humor. Definitely worth reading :)
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Perhaps his best solo effort and that says a whole bunch when you consider Night Fly. Not a single track disappoints. All contain Donald Fagen signature harmonies and horn lines but here he appears to have tapped into something deeper with Sunken Condos.  This album is filled with harmonic and rhythmic  detours that are perfectly instrumentally colored.  Sunken Condos underscores this mans ability to weave sophisticated phrasing and harmonies together in such a way to really say something musically.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found this a little boring in all truth.  I think I found all of the characters very hard to relate to from my own experiences, so found it hard to connect with the book in any particular way.  I was disappointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|Really enjoying this series. Well written. Great intensity and not a predictable story. It has been compared to fifty shades f grey, I think I like this series better! Adults readers only.
0393330435|5.0|This book does a superb job in providing an outline of the life and times of Steve Wozniak. His early days in particular are great to read about. Any fan of Apple needs to read this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loving this series, better than 50 shades!<br />The plot keeps you guessing, it's not predictable like most books.<br />The sex scenes are intense!<br />Def recommend for 20 and older
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I watched and enjoyed both the first and second movie in this series. This one on the other hand...I should've known when I saw catwoman was in it, let alone the actress playing her, that it was bad. I'm not saying that's the only reason this movie is a terrible, steaming pile of nonsensical s***. Mainly it was the absolutely god AWFUL writing. The plot was really bad. Any fan of batman since childhood or just the last two movies will be staring at the screen either in confusion most of the time or wondering aloud: \\"Really?....Like...REALLY?! How is that even....no...\\" The only redeeming quality of this movie was the laugh-out-loud atrocious acting.
0143121006|4.0|some fairly graphic scenes, not for the faint hearted. Very suspensful though. interesting part of China's history. showing the shadier side of westerners in China.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Love the film but HATED the streaming quality through my Playstation 3.  I originally rented the regular stream but it was so bad with the definition so I changed it to HD but it wasn't very much an improvement.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I always look forward to David Baldacci's books. Always a great way to escape the doldrums of my everyday life. This book did not fail to produce great characters, and show they are sometimes flawed with real human problems.  Thanks I can't wait for the next one
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun game,  definitely worth my two dollars. I just finished it and I am already looking forward to part 2.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This is a gift, so I can't rate the movie it self, but did come within a week after release.
B0063GORYU|5.0|addicting. can play at your own pace. took a bit to get the hang of it but we'll worth the time.
B00009R86L|5.0|this helps me significantly with the pain of carrying a heavy bag.. and while it's a bit chunky/ugly, I'm willing to compromise fashion for comfort.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Long, with multiple turns that didn't really follow a good storyline. It also had weak characters, and could have been way better.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was a really good movie, from start to finish. Would watch again and in fact will probally purchase in the future.  Also not near as much language as the first expendables.
1454701250|5.0|I have been following Geninne Zlatkis' blog for a long time. I LOVE her art work, I love her imagination, I love her darling birds. Her book on how to make rubber stamps is very comprehensive. I can't wait to purchase some of the rubber and try my hand at this.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|Ok, this book is not very well written.  The story line is just unbelievable and the dialog is juvenile.  I can't believe that so many people think this is a good book.  I never thought it would end.
1451662432|5.0|Excellent read. It was great to get a backstage look at Arnolds life. I especially like how much time he spent elaborating on each project he worked on as well as how it affected his life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Intense episode!!!!! You definitely need to watch this soon before it comes back in February! Streaming on here is way easier than trying to find it I'd you miss an episode!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I wear this watch daily and love it. It is tough, I have worked hard in it for 8 months or so and it has few scratches on the crystal and none are deep enough to be noticeable. It does run a little fast or slow occasionally but it is not that extreme and I believe its movement is adjustable as well if necessary. I am considering buying another one to put away in a drawer in case I ever loose or break the one I have currently.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is soooooooo awesome! I regimend this for everyone. this game is sooo great you can play different games.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The plot started out slow. and became boring.. There was too much repition and the story line became disjointed.. I'm sorry to say, but I skimmed my way through the last parts and was happy to see the last page!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Was AMAZING!!!! I love this show. I'm going to rewatch it one more time until season 4 starts!! Team Rick!!
B001VIMCW4|4.0|This is an enjoyable Bond offering. Daniel Craig is great as Bond. A worthy successor to many other fine reditions of this quintessentially male character. The female lead in this outing is particularly strong. The editing and storyline are not as seamless as other Bond movies, but the overall effect is more than acceptable.Enjoy.

1400067820|2.0|Of course, the title of this review, should be one's approach to all reading, including of this review.  (NOTE: Narrator does NOT equal author.)    No I didn't buy this book on Amazon, yes I have read it. I am a professional humanities academic (in essence, I study/teach literature, an anti-fragile concept according to the text) and a former manager of upscale restaurants (a business that is, according to the text, anti-fragile; I in part agree both designations of what I have done and do).    First, I do think that the central insight of this book is worth discussing and being written about. I question whether it requires quite so many pages, but that isn't a real critique. Unfortunately, this text does a bad, bad job of doing its subject justice.    My real critiques:    First, much of the evidence is somewhat to very spurious. But, lets put that aside. You can judge that for yourself and I have no desire to get into a dog fight about facts.    Second, the text is repetitive and filled with distracting digressions. But again, that is style, and not really worth getting too into.    Third, the narrator is a jerk (stronger expletive deleted, not because I'm afraid of the \\"body guard\\" looking narrator but because of Amazon's policies regarding such language), but this is only bothersome if it bothers you, for some it might be entertaining, like a highway pile up or something.    Now, fourth, here we've arrived at one of my two main reason for writing this. The central concept is sort of like a hula-hoop, easy to grasp how it works and with pretty clear implications that are quickly dispensed with; it is somewhat clever, but once you get it, your sorta left asking, 'okay, that is useful, what else you got?'  However, watching the train-wreck of the narrator's personality bumble through the explication of anti-fragile was almost worth the price of admission. If you're into that sort of thing, pick it up, you'll figure out anti-fragile within 50 pages and the rest of the time you can imagine the narrator's relationship to the mind of Mr. Taleb -- I suspect, generously, not as much as one wants to imagine, but, maybe I'm wrong. This dynamic was, for me, almost entertaining, but not enough that it kept me from regularly wondering why I was still reading the thing.    Fifth, and here we've the most significant problem of this text. Its thinly disguised political agenda -- anti-fragile is a wonderful concept for the libertarian globalization folk -- and it's a just plain nasty denigration of professional scholars, which is tied to its political agenda. The former is forgivable, if a little embarrassing, all respect to the Paulites, but the ship sailed on libertarian principals when, over 500 years ago, Henry VII hired guys like Edmund Dudley to help control the English economy and grow the central government of the monarchy and then subsequent centuries of monarchs and heads of state doubled down on this expansion. But maybe anti-fragile is the answer. However this book can't tell me that because the text doesn't account for the things it would have to to make that claim. For starters, to do that it would have to genuinely engage with the people who actually know what they are talking about on the subject. As in, go through a process of peer review (yes, the narrator does indeed have peers, sorry sports fans). This process would have helped this text (in order of import) (1st) be shorter, (2nd) be better written, (3rd) be more factual, (4th) be less hyperbolic, (5th) be better argued, and (6) be less irresponsible.  THIS BOOK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.  The text must bash academics because that is the only way it can justify its exclusion of their input (well, except for those that the narrator agrees with or can use). That is simply lazy and stupid writing. It is a shame, there is a good thought here. It's being wasted in this text.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|That's because I am a real fan of Fagen. There's not much he can do wrong, in my opinion. He is such an intelligent, musical writer. And what he does always has its own signature. His music doesn't sound like anyone else's. Not surprisingly, on his own, without his cohorts in Steely Dan he has made his own mark, and for good reason. He's got a very distinctive style as a writer, singer and arranger. With that being said, either you like him or you don't. (He's an acquired taste for many, understandably.) And if you do, you're gonna like it. If you're not a fan of his, this won't be to your liking. I liked it very much.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I began by watching the first 4 episodes of the series on Showtime and found it to be very entertaining. I decided that I would start the book series at the same time but why really happened is that I became obsessed and finished this book within 5 days. Dexter is such a complex character full of true insight on what it means to be a human. Nolan is to continue the series and once I am finished run a full Dexter the series marathon and see if it matches up to a good as the books. WAY TO GO JEFF LINDSAY!
B009KUANWG|5.0|It's pretty great... It starts off with a reminder of what it is, with the haunting, very distinctively 007 brass signature. The song itself is kinda sad. It is haunting and somber. But it's terrific. If you've seen the movie, the song touches on certain aspects of what happens in the film. For fans of the franchise, it is a throwback to the earliest films. Along with the opening credits (after the chase scene and Bond has fallen into the deep), the song is a perfect fit. If it isn't at least nominated for &#34;Best Song&#34; at the Academy Awards this year, I will be surprised. Very worthwhile.

B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My first grader loves this game.  I had to tell him later on that he was actually learning algebra. The game starts out with the most important concept; what you do to one side, you must also do to the other. It slowly introduces new concepts, such as an opposite will cancel out something, etc. It starts off with no numbers at all; it uses pictures at first and slowly introduces numbers, so he won't be scared of math. He actually chooses to play this game over other games. They did a fantastic job with this.
0817439390|4.0|This is a good basic guide to exposure. I was a little disappointed with the photographs, but I think some of the problem was in the printing of the book.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|☆ This Facebook app has been updated! ☆<br /><br />Once a weak app with many bugs, this Facebook app has been heavily updated from its Version 1.9.10 that I originally reviewed here. The 3.8 version (current as of this edit) says that there are \\"Bug fixes\\" but it's far more than that. This highly reworked update now allows for use with the following devices:<br /><br />▪ Kindle Fire HDX<br />▪ Kindle Fire HD<br />▪ Kindle Fire (1st generation)<br />▪ Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone<br />▪ Android devices (Android 2.2 or higher)<br /><br />Have personally tested it with the Kindle Fire devices and Galaxy S III smartphone noted above, and the upgrades are substantial. For frequent or occasional users of Facebook, this app is a good one, and once you've mastered the interface, which is somewhat different from what you find on a Web browser, it does a good job with most of the features you'll find when on your computer.<br /><br />The improved [[ASIN:B0094BB4TW Facebook]] app was developed by Facebook, and is just under 26MB in size in the 3.8 version. It downloads in less than 4 minutes with most devices. Once downloaded and installed, you'll have to enter your Facebook ID and password as expected, and all should go as well as it does with your computer browser. The News Feed is vastly improved, and the messages, which were an on-again/off-again issue, seem to function as we would expect. Your results may be different, but check the About section to see if you have the latest version installed.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the various permissions listed on the product page here, users with a Kindle Fire HD or HDX may want to take a look at the [[ASIN:B00AQ398AY Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]app, and Android users should take a look at [[ASIN:B004QEFQIM Lookout Security & Antivirus]]. Both of these were developed by Lookout Mobile Security, and offer the kind of protection you need while on the Internet.<br /><br />As the largest social networking site with over one billion active users, it appears that Facebook has listened to user issues and responded. It's said that now more than half of the the users on Facebook are using a mobile device, and no longer to we have to access the 'Net using a browser on a Kindle or Android device to get there.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Another Clancy book featuring Jack Ryan. Can't get enough of them. While they haven't been as in-depth in the past 5-6 books, like the first handful were, they still provide a terrific read. Clancy puts enough detail into his books that you feel you can go right out and fly/drive/pilot them, or grab your wrench and fix them once you've broken them. the plots move in spurts so you have a chance to gather your breath before ripping through the next 50 pages of action. Clancy's the man......

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I learned about his book in USA Today in early Nov 2012 and read that he would be featured in one of well known news magazine. It is unusual for news magazine to feature NDE (Near Death Experience) by MD. I had seen (and not read) other books by MDs with NDE and were not featured in news magazine. I was curious what distinguished<br />his story from all NDE. I bought this book after Thanksgiving and finished in less than 2 days. It is an easy and well written account of his story; 2 personal stories in one. This book is my 3rd NDE book that I have read. I have no specific interest in NDE, just happened to be attracted to these books. Dr. Alexander,III presents a valid proof of NDE. I appreciated his Reading List at end of his book. In fact, the other 2 NDE books, that I had read, were listed: Anita Moorjani and Don Piper. Dr. Alexander,III also mentioned a non NDE book by Jill Bolte Taylor regarding her stroke experience and was featured in TED Talks. Dr. Alexander's account was an &#34;exclamation point&#34; to our awakening! I appreciate Dr. Alexander's deliberate intent to expand knowledge in the medical and scientific community.

B000OLRM2O|5.0|\\"My name is not Clay. Clay is the name of the people that owned my ancestors, and I no longer wanna be called by that slave name. I am Cassius X.\\" This was from Muhammad Ali when the reporters interviewed him in the movie. The title of this movie, \\"Ali\\" is the name of Muhammad Ali and it represented Ali as something different. In the movie, the name Muhammad Ali was emphasized a few times because of lot of people was calling Ali his former name, Cassius Clay. However Ali kept his pride as not using his old name and used his new Islam name Muhammad Ali, which was represented by the movie title. Muhammad has his own pride as an African American and he wasn't afraid of show it to America. Muhammad Ali was the greatest boxer in the history of mankind and his story was depicted through the movie \\"Ali\\". Ali was a 2001 American biographical film directed by Michael Mann. Will Smith played Muhammad Ali, and this story was from 1964 to 1974. The story features starts with the fight against Sonny Liston. Then it was the conversion to Islam and the criticism of the Vietnam War. Later, it was the banishment from boxing, returning to fight Joe Frazier and lastly reclaiming the title from George Foreman. In the movie, there were also discussions about the social and political upheaval in the United States, and it talked about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.<br /><br /> In this story, it was mostly made out of accurate events from history. The story has accurate people and facts and it showed how America was like in the 1964-1974. This period was after the Civil Rights Movement and blacks were still searching for equality. Even though the Civil Rights Movement granted equality to the blacks, many of the whites were still not willing to accommodate. At the start of the film, there was Cassius Clay, Jr. (aka Muhammad Ali) running in the streets. The police were driving over saying, \\"What u running from son\\" and left laughing. We could see the racism from those words and the police jokes about blacks running away from something. Then later, Ali fought against Sonny Liston. The odds were against him because Sonny Liston at the time was the champion of the world. However Ali defeated him in the end and was crowned world champion. Next, more history was shown as Malcolm X were good friend with Ali. Ali joined the Nation of Islam and later was given the name Muhammad Ali. In the movie, it showed when Malcom and Ali were good friends and later they were separated because Malcolm left the Nation of Islam. Malcolm provided powerful words through the movie. \\"For those of you who think that you came here today to hear us tell you, like these negro leaders do, that your time will just get better, that we shall overcome, someday, I say to you that you came to the wrong place. `Cause your times will never get better unless you make them better.\\" These were lines from Malcolm and it showed African American spirit through the movie.<br /><br /> In the movie, it also showed part of the history of Malcolm X, it showed the assassination when he was about to make his speech. After Ali was champion, he was a popular figure and was dangerous to the white. Ali was Muslim and he shared the same believes as Malcolm. Afterwards, America wanted to recruit Ali in the army and Ali refused to join. Therefore America charged Ali for not joining the army and Ali lost his boxing license. During this case he said a very powerful line. \\"I ain't draft-doggin'...I ain't burnin' no flag, and I ain't runnin' to Canada. I'm stayin' right here. You wanna send me to jail? Fine. You go right ahead. I've been in jail for 400 years. I can be there for four or five more. But I ain't goin' no 10,000 miles to help murder and kill other poor people. If I wanna die, I'll die right here right now, fightin' you, if I wanna die. You my enemy. Not no Chinese, no Vietcong, no Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere and fight for you. You won't even stand up for me right here in America...for my rights and my religious beliefs. You wont' even stand up for me right here at home.\\" Ali said. This line was extremely powerful as it criticizes America and it shows racism. This was almost Ali's downfall as he loses almost all his money fighting for the court case and he has no job. Thankfully, he got a license in Atlanta for boxing and got to fight Joe Frasier, the new boxing champion. However he lost the fight, but he won the court case and started boxing again.<br /><br /> Towards the end of the story, Ali needs to fight against George Foreman (nicknamed Rumble in the Jungle) to reclaim his title. This was his hardest challenge as Ali was already 32 years old. However, just like in history, Ali was the greatest and he defeated Foreman and was champion once again.<br /><br /> Most of the story was based on real history and people around Ali were all historical figures. In the story, it talked about racism a lot. Ali was a symbol for the African Americans and he wasn't just a black guy that integrates to white society. Ali said, \\"No, I'm definitely going to be the people's champion, but I just ain't goin be the champ the way you want me to be the champ. I'm a be the champ the way I wanna be.\\" Ali was independent and he was out of the system. He isn't going to be some normal boxing champion. He was going to be the exception. Other quote from the movie, \\"Don't put no question to it, man. I done told you, I'm through fightin'. I got a much bigger contender, a much heavier opponent. I'm fightin' the entire US government.\\" This showed African American's enemies are the US government and racism was never over.<br /><br /> In this story, it showed a lot of close people to Ali and they all represented different things. There were the three wives out of four shown in the movie for Ali and they all had something different. One of them represented the Jezebel caricature, she was Ali's first wife and she was open and was the typical type for Americans. One of the most important characters would be Drew Bundini Brown, Jamie Foxx acted him and he was a trainer for Ali. He wasn't shown too much in the movie, but he represented a typical black person. He swore a lot, drank a lot and even sold Ali's belt for money. He was the drunken black guy that couldn't be saved, but Ali still used him and they became good friends.<br /><br /> This was a good movie as it depicts real history and Will Smith was good at being the character Muhammad Ali. It's a good movie for boxing fans as it showed some good scenes and it showed how America is. My favorite quote would be \\"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\\" from Muhammad Ali because he showed true dominance in boxing. He was the champion and everybody should watch it if you want an amazing film filled with history and the story of an amazing boxer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is hands-down the best show on TV. I am typically not into series, but I watched the first season on Netflix and was immediately addicted. I could rave all day about the show, but just take some time and watch the first season and you will have the same addiction. Guaranteed!

B001QWBM62|5.0|I am a independent film maker and I bought this for field recording and for overdubbing audio. This thing is well worth the money it has 2 built in mics that are very sensitive (in a good way) and clean sounding, aIt also has a headphone jack port in the back to plug in lower end shotgun mics if you don't have an adapter for the main bottom ports. All in all great product.

The torture that this 11 year old went through for 18 years is unbelievable in this day and in the USA&#62;<br />If you think this man was a sick pervert who thought he was sick and convinced this innocent child to help him get better.  You are right about a pervert.<br />He & his wife should not be sent to prison for life, and given room & board at the taxpayers expense.<br />They should torture them both, naked and out in the wilderness with no  defenses.

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Now that the first season is available for Prime viewing, I had the chance to compare seasons.  I definitely applaud the ensemble spirit of the show and its creators/producers so that they do not run characters or plots into the ground.  The writing, the scenic design, props work, and the acting continue to be great.  This season belongs to Lily Rabe and Sarah Paulson.  On a final note, I hope that flesh eating &#34;zombies&#34; or the &#34;raspers&#34; in this season mean that the next seasons will be zombie/vampire free.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a magnificently well written book, absolute quality literature, one of the best books I have read ever. The descriptions are imaginative and precise creating a vivid picture in the mind of the reader. The plot is well thought out and weaves an amazing picture that develops brilliantly. The comments on life of the times and the fairness of the political and economic systems is still applicable today, possibly more so, amazing lessons to be learnt here. At times the plot becomes a bit verbose and drawn out, possibly a sign of the era the book was written in, but this can easily be overcome by skim reading these parts without detriment to the overall story. An absolute classic for the discerning reader.
B004WR125O|5.0|I am not an audiophile but based on reviews of these speakers, I decided to buy the Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System along with an Onkyo TX-NR515 7.2-Channel Network A/V Receiver and an Onkyo UWF-1 Wireless LAN Adapter.  My previous system, a ten year old Sony home theater system out of the box was okay but it was time to upgrade.<br /><br />I got a great price on the speakers, $299, and the receiver, also $299, from Amazon ordering on the Tuesday right after cyber Monday.  Set-up was a breeze and I'm no electronics expert.  My previous experience was hooking up my Sony system and everything I needed was in the box.  For this system, I also bought some banana plugs, speaker wire, and wire cutters.<br /> I have no problem accessing all my music from my desktop computer. I plugged in the wireless adapter to the rear usb port of the Onkyo receiver and have no problems with signal strength. Too bad it doesn't use my itunes library.  It uses Windows Media Player and I'm not too fond of that player.<br /><br />I prefer listening to my playlists on my itunes library.  In order to access my itunes library, I use my ipod and plug it in the front of the receiver via a usb port.  Sound through the usb port is much improved over the auxiliary jack analog sound I used to get from my Sony system.<br /><br />In conclusion, the sound is great, the price was right, and the features allow me to access my computer tunes as well as spotify, rhapsody, as well as all the other on-line music services if I choose to listen to them.  Very happy that I finally upgraded.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|I just bought Thaís collection and started watching.... It really reminded me when I first saw these movies on the theaters... As there are many reviews out there, I'll make sure to keep it brief.<br /><br />The packaging: the set comes inside a single disc case. The 3 discs come fixed inside the case. The cover art is fine, but not great. Maybe there could be a special edition with the engraved trilogy logo on the outer box.... Like thematic mugs they sell on Universal studios theme park... Maybe they could even add a sideshow Dino statue.... Who knows? Is there a special edition like that? i really don't know...I'd give the packaging 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Image quality:<br />The movies are featured in 1080p full hd resolution and run really smooth, even the fastest action scene. The colors feel really vivid and real. The locations are just amazing... Despite all these good things, I've noticed some grain during some scenes of the first movie. Almost as if the resolution of the original recording was less than blu-ray full hd resolution. This doesn't make the watching experience any worse, because the movies really look great on blu-ray. I'd definitely rate it 4 out of 5 because of these minor flaws.... (Grains...)<br /><br />The audio:<br />Extremely high fidelity sound. The surround effects are just great. I even got scared at the end of the first movie, when they are at the restaurant located inside visitors center. During this scene, a velociraptor makes some noise that can be heard on the left surround speaker...<br />The soundtrack is really amazing.... I had the DVD boxed set and couldn't wait to hear the great scores on hifi Blu-ray Discs.... I would totally give 5 out of 5 for the sound.<br /><br />The story:<br />No comments.... I just loved all the three movie.... Maybe because since I was a little kid I was a huge dinosaur fan.... The stories are great, filled with action, suspense.... Some may say that these movies are made for kids, but I think everyone has a kid inside... I rate them 5 out of 5.<br /><br />I rated the set 5 out of 5 because I always loved Jurassic park. As I mentioned there are some minor flaws with the image and the packaging, but they won't ruin the enjoyment of watching these movies again and again.<br />It's a great boxed set and I really don't think that anyone who buy it will be disappointed.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy using this app. Lots of creativity to share in many fields! I have spoken highly of this app.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|As another review notes, there's a learning curve. Much of the functionality comes from tapping the settings icon, on the edge of the screen. That's where you can get auto fill. This becomes useful when lastpass tries to login automatically,but without success, such as happens to me with fool.com, or where you have a secondary login.<br /><br />Also annoying is that you can't copy the address of a page to paste within a post. And when you switch between web and app, sometimes you have to login again to crossroads and the site you were previously logged into.<br /><br />Another annoyance: You type in a stock symbol and the browser autoworkers. I see no way to beat this.<br /><br />Follow-up: I let the trial subscription pass. Instead, we have a robust pin with 8 numbers, and configured the Kindle to remember the passwords.  As to the stock symbol problem, I think you can configure Kindle to not autocorrect for this app. Unfortunately, I don't have the app installed anymore to find out.
B0048IH666|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my aunt, who is a huge country music fan, and she loved it.  She cannot believe this CD is actually Kid Rock.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|After watching all the others in the series, this was a must watch.  The story-line was great, but the movie itself was pretty cheesy.  I expected more as my anticipation was at an all time high.  I can't say I won't purchase the series.  All-in-all it was a good exciting film that I could probably watch over and over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome get it know it needs updates but its fun and does any one know how to make a nether portal
B007HACDLK|5.0|Would give ALL his books a &#34;10&#34; if a &#34;10&#34; was available.  I wait every year for the next Mitch Rapp adventure!
B004T32SOK|5.0|Haven't had a problem with it.  I can sync all my primary sources and never have to worry about where I put them.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|lost some details but still good. Good graphics. Suppose they Could have used some known names for acting clout. The end
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I heard Gary live in Austin about 5 years ago and lived him.  The songs on this are diverse but all good.  Great to sit down and listen to.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|There is lots of action and special effects, but the plot is somewhat convoluted. However, it is worthwhile movie to watch and enjoy. I would say between 3 and 4 stars.
B0069UP2PI|2.0|From the previews and the stars of the movie, I expected an interesting, thought provoking movie. Contagion was a good idea. Unfortunately, I found it to be boring.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|One of my favorite movie(s). The set was OK, Amazing picture and sound quality. Lots of extras (see the other reviews). Worth the money, IMO.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I really don't find this one as fun- it doesn't fit in with the whole angry birds realm of games as far as how you play. Its much slower and kind of boring
B005LAIHQS|3.0|I was disapointed by this new release. It was more static. The script is not so funny as in the first 2 parts. Some parts in the movie are really poor acting. I kept it to have the full series, but...
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I have learned from this book a great deal of world history with details that are so enlightening that allow me to make more sense of the information I received in my school years. I warn you, you will not be able to put it away until finished!
B008M87GJK|5.0|This app covers both national and international news top headlines.  It works quickly and refreshes fine.  I like it a lot.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Kids love this game.  Has to be those most enjoyable game they have played.  Highly recommend this game.  Excellent choice.
B004G600A4|5.0|Womderful movie.  Didn't even wait for Xmas. I  sure my daughter has watched it dozens of times already and it is one that she has picked for our road trip
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Pro:  Fun game.  I highly recommend this game.  It can be very challenging and requires a bit of thought.<br />CON:  None to speak of.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|I loved this film - it had all the elements and was executed wonderfully by actors, producers, cinematographer. Everything came together beautifully. Fully enjoyed it
B009PNQUXO|4.0|Pro:  it works.  Allows you to download video to Kindle.  I highly recommend.<br /><br />Con: Product stopped working, but worked well with update.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|If you need to download and watch later this is the app...it is also clear like YouTube itself ...love it!!! Must purchase..
B005HSL626|5.0|Awesome..my score currently December 7 is 404. Yay way good app<br />I hope u enjoy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great 5 star yay
B007HGPBRC|3.0|Christopher Hitchens was an intellectually honest, keen observer of the human comedy, and his good-natured acceptance of both the promise of cure and the dashing of those hopes while suffering from terminal cancer is perhaps the gold standard for facing death without caving in.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a well written story that was such an easy read I finished it in one day.  Having suffered with Bi-Polar I could really relate to the main character.  It was a sweet story of love and friendship.  I can't wait to see the film and the &#34;dance&#34;.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Well written, compelling story told in a nonstop action style with contemporary subjects. I would recommend this novel to anyone, as I would all of Flynn's books.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Tech that doesn't work is normally an irritant, in a baby monitor it is more than that. Works great for a short period of time and then will not connect at all. On the withings site a proposed remedy is to:<br />&#34;Reset your baby monitor by the attached process<br />Remove the WithBaby app from your iPhone<br />Turn ON the Bluetooth on your iPhone<br />Connect your iPhone to your Wi-Fi network<br />Install WithBaby once again and follow the installation process&#34;<br /><br />After doing this repeatedly and getting at most 2 days of proper functioning, on a network with an airport extreme providing flawless connectivity to all other devices, I'm looking to invest in a device that works whether or not it has apple sequence styling.
0671027344|5.0|Read it a while ago, saw the movie, re-read it. Book still Good :) i for sure love this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the story but not the writing style---too much foul language..the author could have written this without all the cursing..
0979019710|5.0|This book is the most influential book I have ever read. I have never gotten such a clear and instant life changing program than in this book. I love Hal's enthusiasm for helping you start creating your best life by developing yourself in the morning. I look forward to every morning now and the rest of the day is great because I feel so great about myself by 8am!<br /> Hal is truly an inspiration.
B000CEGXG4|5.0|i have this on cd when it came out...the vinyl copy is excellent..180 gram ..2 lp set...nice, i am a mark knophler fan, always has been sice i saw him play w dire straits in 1979
B003Q6D27S|1.0|I endured Saw I-VI, noticing the trend of the series toward less plot and more violence for violence's sake. I got through half an hour of Saw 3d and turned it off. It was a numbing, horrid spectacle to say the least.<br /><br />S3d reminded me of the path Friday the 13th took. After five films, it devolved into gruesome acts of violence without any purpose, only that people wanted to see what interesting ways Jason could eviscerate his victims. You can't watch this stuff without feeling sick and distant, as if humanity had certainly gone downhill.<br /><br />S3d is nothing more than a snuff flick.<br /><br />If you like watching people torn apart and their body parts thrown at you, well by all means, have it at.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Strong convincing proof of LAD. Qualified author for this subject with a point of view hard to disregard or dispute.
0062127241|5.0|An amazing book considering lots of factors. Love the way Pete was able to keep a journal, document all the crazy things in his and the bands amazing career. Truly a wonderful read. Was considering Neil Young's book and took a few minutes reading each book side by side and Pete's story and writing keep me turning the pages.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very slow start but it picked up and ended up as a terrific story told from a very unique perspective.
0345540565|5.0|I loved this series. My husband and teenage son are reading it too.  This is a series I could read again just because I'm sure there are little details I missed the first time  around.  Awesome story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A real page turner that I am used to from Flynn! Mitch is back to his old self and then some!
B000J103X4|5.0|the item arrived as described, it was in a brand new unopened package damage and debris free. No scratches and clear as a whistle. The game is very talented, and this cd is good for just personal use like getting the morning crancked up on the way to work, or at night while youre getting dressed for a night out on the town, a must have item

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the crisp clear easy to read numbers. The cut and paste function is also helpful.  You can't ask for a better calculator program for the cost; which is free.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|My brother loves Angry Birds! He forced me to buy it and now he made me addicted to the game! This app is really good, fun, and addicting, BUT, seriously?! Three dollars! My brother FORCED me to pay three dollars. At first, I was like, no way. But I had to buy it. Please lower the price!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Hugh fan and this is no exception!  It was great to wake up to kindles automatic updates and find this version already downloaded and ready to go.  Keep them coming Rovio
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i love chess so this app is amazing. I go to sleep late because i love to play chess, So thank you amazon for this free app. I ordered the kindle touch, for my girlfriend i will give her that next week. She wanted a flat iron for her hair and every where else was so expensive i told her look on amazon and she couldn't believe it so i ordered one for her. I'm so pleased with all the products and the variety of products as well, and the customer service are so helpful every time i call they are patient and knowledgeable as well. I would recommend amazon to all my family and friends.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I chose this movie because of the great foundational lessons children's movies generally exude, as I thoroughly enjoy and appreciate how relevant they are to the perspective each of us idealizes and lets slip in the grind of the settled for ordinary.  Great film.
1401937268|5.0|I am interested in Tarot and love the gentle messages the Doreen Virtue gives in her weekly Angel Card readings.  These cards are beatiful and, while keeping the ancient tarot meanings, they convey the messages in gentle and hopeful ways. If one is considering giving readings for others, the pictures and messages are comforting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Nice. Won t spend money though. Fun for casual gaming. Probe going to buy cityville for my Pc now.. good times
B003L77GRO|5.0|I have loved this show since it's premier and I enjoy collecting each season. Gotta love that Michael C. Hall.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|awsome movie love all the bourne movies, this guy may be the next james bond in the making!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just saying
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game has great graphics for being such a simple game.  Complete time waster so some people may like it for a long time, but it will probably not keep a true gamer occupied for very long.  Very fun game even though its very hard to get cash.  If you want to spend real money you will progress in this game really fast, but who the heck wants to do that with a time waster style game.  Worth it when it's free.
B002JC9RMY|3.0|Ok this movie could of been a lot better than what it was.  They had good actors and good plot from the cartoons, but they blew it .  The director must of been sleeping on the job, he took the story and boxed it  in sections with no concern to the story.  Well I could go on and on but I will not , this is just my opinion the movie could of been lots better.  But for alot of special efects and chop sockie it may appeal to lot of other people.  So give it shot  you may like or not thats my opinion.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive in a mindless pathetic boring kinda way! Great way to pass the time. I love it and so do my kids!
B007PFD90G|3.0|If you're interested in issues of free expression and religious intolerance this is really a good read; I had no idea how shabbily the British government treated Rushdie during the fatwa period. For most of the book he keeps his rather large ego in check, but at the end it gets a bit overwhelming. Nonetheless the look into what it means to be a protected person for years and years is fascinating.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I go to the website asap, it's really nice to have this short cut on the tablet, I access this website more now
B00130UFY2|5.0|Five stars for the haunting, unrecoverable memory symbolized by the solo bassoon (Richard Skinner, performing John Powell's composition); for the wordless bonding between Bourne and Nicky (Julia Stiles); for the desperate, intimate struggle between Desh (Joey Ansah) and Bourne, reminiscent of James Bond's with Grant (Robert Shaw), and for the trauma in Nicky's and Bourne's faces as they try to put it behind them; and for Albert Finney's rubbing our noses into it: you aren't David Webb, the old America, any more -- look at what you have done.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Grandkids play this all the time, they can't put it down.  They would rather play than eat there dinners or lunches
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is my third re-read and fourth copy.  It has the perfect amount of &#34;snark&#34; for me and my friends.  Do not read anywhere you cannot laugh very loudly.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|It didn't work on my tablet so I had to delete it from my tablet.  My grandson wanted to play it but only got a blank screen
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I loved seasons until the new Christmas update. you get the first 9 levels but then have to wait a day per level to play the rest. its ridiculous why would you do that?? wait a whole day for one measly level?? stupid!!!! thanks rovio. jerks!!!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I tried it a couple of times but not thrilled about it,  I go on the google search and enter that way.  Too fine a print to work on
0670023329|5.0|The dehumanization of others by those who wield  total power over their lives is harrowingly reported in this compelling and important book. The darkest part of this story is that it continues to happen as I write these words. North Koreans are living in the worst gulags of the world. My hope is that this book will become a means of awakening people about the present horror and will motivate people to do whatever they can to close these camps down. The prospect of eliminating all evil in the world in this age seems remote, but great success has been experienced when people are willing to work sacrificially and corporately to target a specific evil and eradicate it. Do we have the vision and passion and conviction of previous generations to do this? May I live to see the end of these labour camps as my father lived to see the end of the Nazi death camps.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|This game doesn't work on my tablet so I had to delete it from the tablet.  It would have been great to have this for my grandson but it doesn't work
B004OZNS2E|5.0|It is such a great movie and I am surprised that after all these years this movie is still fantastic.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|This game didn't work on my tablet and too bad because I love to play chess, but that is the chance one takes when buying a game
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Halo series, but with that aside, this is a great movie even if you have no idea what the games are about.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|The product was in perfect condition and no exterior damages.  Haven't tested the DVDs yet but I felt like I was opening a brand new DVD without any imperfections on it.  I've been trying to replace certain DVDs in my Harry Potter collection that are not the right format or that do not have the extra features.  I feel this product was a steal for it's price and I love it!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought this book started slow. Then it started to accelerate and really change directions. After which the plot thickened and continuedto a surpeizingly unique ending. It was a great read.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Fabulous!! This was a great fictional piece based on historical facts. A page turner from start to finish! An absolutely great read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Even though I personally have only seen a few episodes on PBS we all fell in love with it so I decided I would get this as an additional present for the family for Christmas.  I am nervously anticipating being being able to watch these episodes so we can catch up and be prepared for season 3.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I enjoy having Lucy more involved in the story line.  Also, Kay's  reationhip with her husband was sketchy.<br /><br />Story a little confusing n the beginning.<br /><br />I look forward to the next Kay Scarpetta novel.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Just as good as the series.  Why FOX never considered continuing it still amazes me but then they have done the same thing with other popular shows too.  I just wish this was one they would have kept, our family loves it
B003XVYLDU|5.0|What can I say about Slaughterhouse-Five, besides that it is a literary work of art. I love Kurt Vonnegut's dark humor and satirical writing style. This is one of my favorite books of all time.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I was disappointed in the movie. I expected more out of this movie. I would not reccomend this to others
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|This is a good movie and everything but would the person who made this should put a little more problems in the movie to solve so then it will be more interesting and be a little more interesting for kids. Happy watching!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is one of the very few games I downloaded for myself. It has great graphics and no time pressure. The puzzles range from simple to difficult but all are solvable if you stop, study the image, and think. The map is gorgeous and very useful. Before downloading I noticed several comments about the map being useless but I disagree strongly...it is easy to use.<br /><br />One thing I really like is this game is nonlinear. I can solve the puzzles in any order, skipping and going back to solve a puzzle later if I need to. Some puzzles obviously need other puzzle solutions to solve them but I can ignore them until I figure out that and go solve others.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Tiene un mensaje de orden y de seguir instrucciones. Las ni&ntilde;as pueden aprender sobre ahorrar para comprar las diferentes piezas.
1401937519|5.0|Since books are magic, which can transform lives, this one does just that by taking me vicariously into the next life or the spirit world and rocking the foundations of my belief systems to their very core.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The kindle stays perfectly in place.  The kindle turns on/off with the case co st perfectly.  The stand works great,  I can set it up and read great.  The case adds very little weight to the kindle, so holding it is great.  I love this case so much that I wish they made cases it for the iPad.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is'nt my favorite Pixar movie, but was a good first fairytale for Pixar.  The plot was interesting and has the typical fairytale ending.  If your looking for a nice movie for children or simply love Pixar movies like myself this is a good choice.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|LIfe is a wonderful show depicting life in many forms, mammals, insects, birds, reptiles and amphibians as well as subjects as creatures of the deep without backbones and predator and prey.  This series not only taught me about life around the planet but also some extraordinary animals and plants I barely knew anything about.  The photography is stunning and in bluray was brilliant.  The narration by David Attenborough was clear and easily understood.  I did have to wonder at times as I heard the British pronunciation of some words but it didn't prevent my comprehension, it broadened my knowledge of how we differ, just another part of life!  I really enjoyed the series and learned a lot.  My memories of chimps, Komodo Dragons and water buffalos are still with me.  After each episode, a 10 minute short explains how the most difficult sequences were filmed.  A very valuable exercise which made me wish I was there to do it too.  Great series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Weak ending.  It felt like a push from the editor to hurry the author along.  The 1st two books were much better.
B001B6M0F0|5.0|This, without a doubt, is one of the greatest all time rock albums. Even though so few really know of it or appreciate it. I personally haven't heard this album since the early eighties. A real shame it's not played on the radio.
1401232590|5.0|The story is insanely entertaining. Hooks you in from the beginning and delivers an ending that will stay in the back of your head long after you are done reading it. This is perfect for any fan of the movies, books, newcomers. Great start for anyone getting into batman and a MUST HAVE for anyone who has not read it or added it to your collection.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|We absolutely love this show! We loved watching every episode and we continue to watch the new season, never missing an episode.
0307383415|1.0|A man full of hate for those that are not like himself (namely whites).  Although this book is disturbing, it is an important read for those that want to understanding the man and the direction he wants to take our country.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|My 3 1/2 y/o son loves it. And since we bought it, he wants to watch it all the time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|the first half of The Racketeer was gripping and the author gets some good op/eds on the legal system in the US.<br />The story gets bogged down when the protagonist forms a sham company to disguise an convoluted plot.<br />The last part is a total shocker and worth the short wade thru an overly complicated scheme near the end.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|A well researched and informative read. Gets bogged down a little in the middle with chess, but overall well worth spending time with.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|On one side, I really like the main idea and settings behind it.<br /><br />But on the other hand, I feel there is inconsistency on how the characters developed throughout the film.
0812992784|4.0|A very good read and an author whom you can't help but like and sympathize with. It jumps around a little but this does not hinder the enjoyment.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I thought this was an incredible movie. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did academy award-winning performances, and Steve Carrell did an incredible job as their marriage counselor...just incredible! The movie was so much better than I expected. I can't understand the negative reviews!!  This is a great movie..!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I got Matched a little while ago and couldn't put it down, as soon as I got my kindle I got this book and I read it so fast!  I already have Reached bought and ready to read!!!
B003U4UNPK|5.0|LOSt is by far my favorite show. i love lost i love all the characters. so well written and well done. great actors.
B008LSVLGU|4.0|What a deal!  Eighteen albums on ten CD's.  From Smith's late 50's recordings into his early 60's sets. Like all Real Gone Jazz box sets, there's no liner notes-just recording dates and personnel for each album-good enough.  The box is sturdy and each discs slips into a cardboard envelope.  On the front of each are the original album covers for that disc.  The sound quality is very good-despite what others have said.  I own a number of these sets, and the sound is never less than good.  Is it \\"audiophile\\" good?  Probably not.  But let's not quibble-the sound is crisp without being harsh, and each instrument can be heard clearly.<br /><br />Needless to say the music is awesome.  Even some of Smith's lesser works contain some real goodies on them.  His sound and style-anchored in both be-bop and the blues-was delivered with a lot of excitement and intensity.  Even his ballads had a kind of directness to them.  But by now everyone knows Jimmy Smith and how he laid down the organ sound for every player who came after him.<br /><br />If you don't own his work from this era, this is a no-brainer.  Even if you do own some of these albums, it's still a no-brainer.  Pick this set up before it disappears.  What a deal.
0802473156|5.0|What's great about this book is that it gives you the &#34;language&#34; (har, har pun intended!) to talk about your needs and desires. My mom says that every couple should receive this book as a wedding shower gift.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|After they finally &#34;did it&#34; in the Season 4 finale, I didn't have great hopes for Season 5. What I've seen so far, though, I've loved. The Caskett relationship has grown in realistic ways and some of the episodes have quite innovative. I hope it continues.
B000SGGUWS|1.0|I am a director of education and read contemporary juvenile and young adult literature so that I am aware of what many students are reading. I was SHOCKED by the contents and characters in this book. I found the characters to be plucked straight from TV shows that are aimed at adults and the plot developed as a situational comedy/drama.<br /><br />I do not think that it is an appropriate book for any youth in high school or younger to read. The author has placed her teen age characters in adult situations. In addition, none of the adults in the book is a good parental model. The adults are immature, self absorbed, and emotionally still adolescents. The teen aged characters lie, drink, do drugs, steal cars, have sexual encounters with teachers, have sexual encounters with older young adults (one character goes after her college-age sister's boyfriend who is in medical school.) and show no remorse or examination of conscience for their actions.<br /><br />I find such behavior in high school sophomores to be highly inappropriate for a book aimed at middle- and high-school students.<br /><br />On page 88 the author refers to one mother as a MILF.  This means means \\"Mother I'd Like to F*#%\\", I couldn't believe that an editor and publisher allowed it to appear in a book for youth.<br /><br />I am not a prude, but I do believe that books for youth should not further sexualize teen girls and young woman, especially through situations that have them lusting after older men (who are happy to return the lust).<br /><br />It is a sad reflection of our society that editors and publishers believe that this book is appropriate for youth. But, they are as greedy and driven by market success and money as the characters in the book, no matter the true cost to others and the harm done in the long run.<br /><br />Equally shocking to me are the parents who allow their children to read these books without first reading, reviewing, or at least reading reviews of them. Parents NEED to parent. Just because a book in labeled and marketed as Young Adult does not mean that the book is appropriate for youth. It is negligent (if not criminal) that this book is able to be published and marketed as a book for Young Adults.
0393317552|5.0|i lov everything about this book.  tis epic in scope and concisely written in high school english.  brilliant insights and common sense conclusions.  no trite snobbish  moralizing as in some liberal academic tomes
B0058YPGSY|5.0|What is there to say about Sons of Anarchy--If you are considering Season Four, you obviously know how great the series is.  Buy it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The perspective felt unique and the story held my attention but I never felt on edge like one would expect a zombie book would make you feel. I enjoyed it anyway.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is really addictive. It's easy enough for my 5 year old &amp; my 7 year old, yet still challenging enough for me as well.
B0020M99LC|5.0|great movie, action,drama.  loved it. Could have used a few more beautiful women, but great otherwise. Clean enough to watch with the teenage kids.  Good choice for an easy to watch rental. Daniel Craig is great.
B005NFVZZG|5.0|I love this TV program. My schedule keeps me from seeing it on a regular basis I missed the whole third season. That I had to purchase it. Now. I am just slightly behind this the fourth season. I am still intrigue with the show that I might have to purchase this seasons  show individually. The problem now is it third season took up lot of space on my kindle not sure how to download the next couple shows don't have enough room for the videos
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Liked that it was different than many of the other movies out there. Kids really enjoyed the movie, too. Good lesson to teach.
030758836X|5.0|This book was so messed up, but oh so good! I can't really say much without spoiling many of the twists and turns. Let's just say this: never judge a book by its cover.
0385344333|1.0|This last book is just a continuation of the sad boredom that Reacher has become; Child needs to move on in his writing life or risk boring himself into fog. The first 3 or 4 books were top-notch in every way-read them and then stop-- if you want to continue the series only get them FREE from your public library.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not my favorite - but still good. A little disjointed - seems not quite finished. Some loose ends - but very glad Flynn is still able to write!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful film!  Great message:  Quit complaining and enjoy life.<br />Superbly cast - not a weak link in the whole ensemble.<br /><br />...and I love renting movies on Amazon - very convenient!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read the reviews and was slightly disappointed. But after reading the book, it wasn't as bad as some reviews made it out to be. I think it started off reaaallyy slow. It took a while for me to get into this one. But, once I got about. 1/2 way through, it picked up.<br />Essos is not Westeros, so going in I knew I wouldn't see as much of our friends in King's Landing. But I enjoyed it none the less. I liked Danerys' story in this book, she is truly beginning to grow into a woman. I also like Jons story, leaving boyhood behind and becoming commander.<br />I think it was a good book.<br />Spoiler Alert:<br />I'm not sure where Martin is going with Jon, if he dies, it will truly be a slap in the face to the readers. I understand characters must die, but his dying would really hinder the storyline. He is truly the last hope for House Stark and to kill him off now would be tragic.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Although it doesn't sound like the traditional Tom Petty we all may be used to, it is still Tom Petty.  In other words, it's Tom Petty people, you will not be disapointed.
B004QMW1NM|4.0|This is a great album. Very upbeat and catchy!<br /><br />Young Blood & Punching in a Dream are my favorite tracks but I recommend purchasing the entire album.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I love this app but if anyone knows how to change (kindle fire) skins textures or join nonlinear servers plz post
B0054SMID0|4.0|Tricky,Tricky,Tricky!! I would have watched this sooner if I knew it was this good.Kept my attention all the way through.I kinda knew it was going to happen but at least Frank will be able to do Showtime gig.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Finally a movie that brings to a head the previous solo Avenger character movies. Can't wait for a sequel, and you know it will soon be here.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I Love Facebook!!!!Use it everyday!!!! I think it is very important to stay in touch with family and friends that live far and near!!!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I see many reviews saying the movie was too long or the plot points didn't add up.  I'm really not sure what they really were watching to come up with that opinion.  This was a well thought out, great story with amazing acting.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|Having the additional DVD is great. Really brings the true Elvis to light in great behind the scene action...Great for the true Elvis fan
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I purchased this device before a 3 week family trip to Perth Australia over Christmas/New Year break.  I found that it needs to be recharge cycled, as they recommend, a few times to reach it's full capacity.  I was able to recharge my smartphone twice on a single charge on the Astro2.  My cellphone has a high capacity battery pack that was also purchased for the trip.  Very happy with this device.  My brother-in-law has the big brother to this unit and he also likes these products.
B000YHG72E|5.0|elf is a fantastic movie! once i got it i  was so excited and i organized a movie night with all of my friends! we all loved it and we are in college!
B009HTPMNK|5.0|loved this movie ive seen every batman film thats animated and live action and also own all of them also and this is the best batman film out of all of them just great cant wait for part two getting it the day it comes out
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I know as most of you have stated that the Kindle Fire HD was a little bit misleading when I first looked at it, because it lead us to believe it had a camera on it. Even so, this app will do the trick. You are taking pictures in a strange way, but it is doable! It's more for people who like to skype, and take their own photos for facebook. But, it stores your pics in the photo app. on the Kindle. Easy to look at later. Takes fairly good pictures. Not bad for $2.00. Bad on Amazon's part, that we have to pay for it at all!! Hence the 3 stars!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|With all the hype this series received I had to read it, like most others I guess.  Looking back I really enjoyed it and no, not for all the &#34;kinky&#34; elements, which frankly formed a foundation, but for the interaction between 2 people, the email &#34;chatter&#34; was brilliant.  The element of a brilliant mind totally messed up by circumstances was so well done.  I regret if they do the movie they will focus of the kinky and not the relationships and interactions between people which was really the books key value
B0063IH60K|5.0|what can i say good old fashion solitaire fun to play and hard to pull myself away from the game
B007CI81IQ|5.0|Leaving aside traditional views, the book show a new way to think the poverty. It made me wonder that to solve poor people problems we need to know what them think and feel, rather than simply saying what's best for them.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|great case, for the price, dose everything it need to do and stand up, opens and closed. I just love it for the price. Cant go wrong
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game. The pop up ads can be a pain but it is free after all. Would recommend to anyone .
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Fun game, but very limited, but what do you expect for free. It keeps my kids busy for a while
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am a person who is on Facebook at least once a day so it was nice to be able to get it on my Kindle Fire as well. Works just as well as on a smart phone or computer.
B004SDEP38|3.0|I haven't spent much time with this app but plan to after the very busy holiday season and hopifully will understand it better.
B0060CV31C|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid when it first came out and had loved it ever since. I never owned it but when I got a Kindle Fire I wanted to get a movie that I could watch anytime and anywhere, and this movie is that kind of movie.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|speaks for itself, look up any word and there you are.  gives you all the information you need for everything.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I honestly never ever heard of this movie before, but it is freakin amazing! Just take a really dysfunctional family trying to travel together in a broken vehicle with problem after the next... honestly, this movie might make you tear a bit in some parts but it is hilarious and has a good meaning in the end: family is family no matter what. It's about the youngest daughter going to compete in a competition but I wouldn't at all recommend for young girls; the language isn't so great. But a must see if you have a sense of humor.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|very fun game. adictive and takes up a lot of time. I have to pull mysefe away from it to do my other stuff.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Storyline interesting.  Adventure elements well done.  HO scenes were great.  Zoom worked perfectly. Would recommend.  Played on my KF and had no issues.  Good solid game for adventure lover's.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book.. it's so easy to get lost in the words and imagain the characters in this book as real individuals. I love it!
B005KJZDW6|5.0|The sound is absolutely fantastic on LP. It sounds like you are back in the fifties! It is true Christmas spirit.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Always enjoy this character and this story did not disappoint.  Exciting - a fast read and definitely keeps the reader's interest throughout the story.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie with the critics reviews. I want to know what movie they were watching!!!<br />This movie was FANTASTIC!!!! Christina was superb. The story line was good and Cher did another great performance.<br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates a great musical.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I truly can't say anything about this story.  I have followed these characters for years and was totally disappointed that she chose to make these same characters that in the past were strong, independent and driven into pathetic people with no self confidence....was really sorry that I purchased this book
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We do not have Showtime, therefore the purchase.  I watched all discs in one weekend (bad weather for outdoor activities).  I was hooked and needed to watch more.  I do not think it was predictable.  Claire Danes is awesome in this series.  I think anyone interested in military, government, and/or, works in mental illness would enjoy this series.  I will be buying the 2nd series.  It has been passed on to another family member for viewing.
076115678X|4.0|This book was so informative to me regarding the different types of curls.<br />I've started doing the curly girl method and can see a healthier difference<br />with my hair.<br />I've even tried a couple of the recipes......WOW!
B009329ZF2|5.0|The loved it!  They both commented about the low ratings and reviews given to this movie by movie reviewers outside of Amazon.com.  They highly recommend it!
