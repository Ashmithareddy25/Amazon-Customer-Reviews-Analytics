B004XUMOGQ|5.0|Great movie 5/5 stars
B0073COMKW|5.0|Great bright, soft light.  Same color as incandescent, but a bit brighter.  Doesn't produce gobs of heat like an incandescent.  Turns on right away, doesn't flicker, no hum, contains no mercury (I hate CFLs).  Quality and cost are finally good enough to start making the switch.  We installed these bulbs in all heavily used lights.<br /><br />At least for the lights that are used the most.<br />How fast does it pay for itself?  Depends on how much you use the light.<br />The cost savings per year are ( watts_for_new_bulb - watts_for_old_bulb ) * avg_hours_per_day_light_is_on * 365 * (cost_per_kwh / 1000).<br />This bulb saves about $2 per year per hour you use it a day, assuming $0.11 per kwh.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It's weird, nothing changes in dialect when the chapter's POV changes. I kept having to figure out which POV I was reading from because they were both the same.  I found it to be confusing, huge change from the first two. I LOVED the first two so much but this one did not live up to my expectations. Oh yeah and the end is a huge disappointment as very commonly stated. I am glad a read it although I am left feeling unfulfilled... Whomp whomp whoommppp

B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I guess there must be a book per year clause in his contract. This is by far the weakest of his books. His analogies are surprisingly weak, and his conclusions are both forced and unconvincing. I rarely put a book down, but I had to force myself to read this and could barely make the end.... a total waste of time. Read his other books and skip this one.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|This book could have been so good. You follow a few characters, characters you can really root for. Characters you really want o get involved in their story, however the author refuses to let this happen.<br />I am a fantasy book lover; I am familiar with the idea of switching from one character to another between chapter sets. The issue with this book comes with how often he switches. Every single chapter either changes which character you’re following or the time in which you were following the character. This might not sound so bad but it never lets you really get drawn into any specific character, it never lets you really become emotionally involved with the characters.<br /><br />The other problem with this book is there is no driving force. I remember being 77% of the way done this book and thinking to myself. “Who are the bad guys &#34;, &#34;what's the point in this story&#34;. Obviously each character has their own struggles in this book, but there is nothing that ties any two characters together. Sanderson references an evil force several times, they hint it might come back and be a main antagonist. Several times I told friends I’m not picking this book up ever again because there is no driving force. It follows three people, talks about their far from ordinary lives, but to what point? If you get free of this mess, then what? Is the story over? If all three of you died, the world would be fine, your life would be over which I suppose would suck, on the flip side This is supposed to be a 10 book series, so i understand a slow start, but this is something else. Shouldn’t you want your readers to want to read the book because it draws them in, not because they started it and refuse to give up?<br />The whole time I read, I was thinking to myself &#34;it’s going to get better, just wait&#34; mentally begging Sanderson to just once let me read to consecutive chapters about the same character. Let me get a decent way into one story before you change it on me again, but he never does. He refuses to let up. If anyone reads this book and does not feel this same frustration I will be shocked. Once again, I understand multiple story lines, but let one develop a bit before you cut to another. Its not the same suspense of not being able to wait to read about the other person again, its the annoyance of wanting to skip ahead a few chapters so you can keep your mind on one character for more than a few pages.<br /><br />At any point in the book, one of the three main characters could be killed and it wouldn’t make a difference in any way shape or form.<br /><br />In case Brandon Sanderson somehow reads this... I really like what you did with the Wheel of time series it was amazing. Your Mistborn trilogy was good, I read all three books and was very satisfied. I dont understand how you expected people to be drawn into this story when you dont actually let people read for long enough to become attached. PLEASE this is a cool world, the characters are good, just let me actually read one without a constant frustration. Let it build anticipation instead of frustration.<br />All this being said, I didn’t hate the novel, I did finish the book after all, but I can say I would NOT recommend this book.
B004KPHQR6|2.0|The idea is similar to &#34;Starman&#34; but the character development is not good.  The acting of the female lead is pretty poor and the entire storyline is not even suited for a 12 year old.

B009M7G1PU|4.0|The book is so much more than I remember of my last read, 35 years ago or more.  Lawrence's politics may not have been interesting to me then, but Lady Chatterley's talk of disparity is the same as ours today of inequality. And that's that! ... His monologues might sometimes be better as dialogue, as his dialog is often brilliant, particularly when it explodes in anger, exposing the very great differences between the parties.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|***First of all, I’m going to try my best to not put any spoilers in this review but if you’ve been around the internet over the past couple of days you may already know how the trilogy ends<br /><br />When I finished “Allegiant” I knew right away that the shocking ending was going to get the Divergent universe worked up. I knew fans were going to be angry and not like the ending. I don’t like that fans are actually physically threatening Veronica Roth. She is an author. Her job is to write an entertaining story and it is her prerogative to end her series however she wants.<br /><br />Now, let me tell you why I like the way the Divergent series ended:<br /><br />First of all, whether in books or in movies, I like it when things happen that I don’t see coming. I already knew there was a shocking ending to “Allegiant” but wasn’t sure exactly what that would be. I like the surprise of something happening that makes me take a break in my reading and think it through.<br /><br />Also, let’s be realistic, if any of us lived the life of Tris, we wouldn’t have made it halfway through book one, right? The ending is reality. There are consequences to the choices we make. Sometimes we have to bear those consequences but very often, those we love have to bear them too.<br /><br />And finally, I think it was a very bold and gutsy move on the author’s part to end her series this way. I’m sure she knew that readers were not going to be happy but she stuck with what she felt was right and wrote a story that was true to her vision.<br /><br />Thank you, Veronica Roth, for an engaging and entertaining story about a girl who made hard choices and inspired a group of friends to do the same.

B00DC3DGSK|4.0|It would not be inexpedient saying that splitting Buddy Guy’s latest outing into the Rhythm and the Blues sections is barely conditional. The “Rhythm” section is probably more soulful, more non-blues audience oriented, aimed on capturing the listener. Best examples of such approach are sides featuring guest artists like “One Day Away” (with Keith Urban) and “What You Gonna Do About Me” (with Beth Hart), as well as “The Devil's Daughter” and almost rockabilly version of “Well I Done Got Over It”. Although guitar playing is excellent and powerful voice is in place, new attributes are added to performance. Incorporation of multitude of wind instruments which is uncommon for Buddy Guy would be of no surprise considering set’s partial focus on that younger, still “unBluesed” generation aiming awakening its interest in the roots music. Mentioning of Blues legends like Muddy Waters and B.B. King and telling stories about them serves the same aim.<br /><br />Considering the title of the set, “Rhythm”, which for the purpose of this album means variety of genres like R&B, Soul, even rockabilly, the genres nearby the core music (for inveterate fans it’s still the Blues) emphasize is made on the fact which is absolute truth for the already legendary musician, the fact that these and many other musical genres, if not all, have the roots in the Blues. May we also assume that the title of an album includes a slight doze of cunning aiming attraction of wider audience to the music (not the album itself) called the Blues.<br /><br />The guitar playing already mastered to excellence long ago to the extent when it’s almost impossible to make it better thus yielded to temptation of swinging slightly to dare-devilness in first set, totally evaporates with the start of the second.<br /><br />Heavier, Buddy-ish attempt is taken on “Blues” sequel. “Too Damn Bad” is the sign we are in Chicago. Guitar becomes mad, screaming, gritting and gnashing in unimaginable manner and listener follows it being also stressed with youthful and powerful voice of Mr. Guy, desirable for artists twice younger than him. Not even a slight doze of indifference, all, every touch of the strings is given to the music.<br /><br />That’s an attitude, that’s dedication to the attraction of life, to the Blues.<br /><br />He is home, he’s in his own ambient and it goes on like it on “Evil Twin” featuring Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford, and Joe Perry, and so on through “Never Gonna Change” till the end. Buddy delivers the Blues and he deserves to say as title of one of his songs suggests, “All That Makes Me Happy Is The Blues”.<br /><br />Buddy is here, Buddy is with the Blues and Buddy is in the Blues!<br /><br />If you want to appease hunger for pure Chicago Blues, then you stopped exactly where you had to.<br /><br />Brilliant!<br /><br />Set is produced by Buddy’s longtime collaborator, musician, songwriter and producer, Tom Hambridge.<br /><br />Personnel: Harvey Thompson (tenor saxophone); Jim Horn (baritone saxophone); Steven Herrman (trumpet); Charles Rose (trombone).<br />Guest musicians: Kid Rock, Keith Urban, Beth Hart, Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford, Joe Perry, Gary Clark, Jr.<br /><br />pastblues.comunimaginable manner and listener follows it being also stressed with youthful and powerful voice of Mr. Guy, desirable for artists twice younger than him.

The interrelationships among the people in the various vignettes was difficult to follow.<br />Main theme is, I'm not certain, Loss comes to mind as does Choices - good and bad - and the consequences, perhaps.<br />Beyond and over-arching all was the lovely seduction language, almost a distraction, but very heart-grabbing.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I waited almost a year for this book, and was ecstatic when it finally came out. I couldn't wait to see who Edith prior was, Tobias's POV, and finish one of my favorite series. Not so much. When I started the book, I couldn't believe how much different Tobias's POV was from Free Four and The Transfer. Tris and Tobias were like one person. I would read a chapter, and it would say something like \\"my girlfriend\\" and I would think 'What? This is Tris talking' then I would find out it was really Tobias, and vice versa. So, basically, there was no difference between Tris and Tobias. I actually did like the storyline, although a couple of things.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />I hated that Uriah died, I think Tobias was a bit too concerned with the damaged genes thing, and I CANNOT believe that Tris died. Are you kidding me??? First of all, Caleb should've save her. Second of all, oh Tris can stand the death serum! Now she gets shot. Third, Tobias isn't that broken up about Tris's death, to be frank. So he has two little freak out sessions.  He loved her! Come on. Fourth, Tobias is a POLITICIAN?!?!?!? Four, the dauntless legend is a politician. Lame. Lastly, that's it? Tris dies, Tobias doesn't get a girlfriend, get married, anything like that, he lives with his mother. Yay!!!!! Not. Back to Tris's death.  It wasn't necessary. There was no point to her death. She died for the shock factor, which really bugs me. I wanted Tobias and Tris to have a happy ending after all that, but no. Veronica Roth just had to destroy our hopes. And Uriah dies too? Really? All of our favorite characters, dead.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Roth. I have lost trust in you, and you have turned an amazing series into a horrible one, and you just lost a fan. Bravo! I hope you're happy!<br /><br />*Edit* Ok, so I've read a few of the 5-star reviews, and thought about the book for a bit. I understand Tris's death more. I get that she had to go into the room instead of Caleb, because if she had letCaleb in, she wouldn't have been her selfless self. So I get it. And if veronica Roth wanted to have her die from the death serum, so be it. But for her to survive the death serum, then die from a gun shot? If she had to die, at least have it be from something good. And for Tobias to have the light of his life taken from him like that? So I don't want to change my rating, it still only deserves 2 stars, but I've thought about it, and I still don't think Tris should've died that way.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|*** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ***<br /><br />Before I begin, I think it's important that I kind of let you know where I stand with the Divergent series up to this point. I LOVED Divergent so much. It pulled me out of a massive reading rut and made me fall in love with YA again. Then I read Insurgent and was not wowed. Honestly, I think I should have given the book more like 2.5 or 3 stars (I gave it 4.. no idea why, especially after re-reading my review).<br /><br />I was excited about Allegiant because of the big bang ending that was in Insurgent, but honestly my hopes weren't that high. I wasn't convinced that Allegiant was going to wow me, and I was right.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I don't like how Tris and Tobias pushed aside their problems by making out<br /><br />Tris and Tobias's relationship still isn't perfect in Allegiant. They have things they need to talk about and discuss. But ANY time this situation comes up, they bury it by making out. It's literally like:<br /><br />\\"We need to ta--\\"<br />Suddenly I felt his mouth on mine. [Cue make out scene.]<br /><br />Paraphrasing, but that's the gist of it. SO.MANY.TIMES. It's almost like they thought they had to make up for their fighting/distance in Insurgent, but this was not the right way to do it! You can't just hope your problems will go away by cutting them off with a kiss. It doesn't work like that.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I kind of wish Tris and Tobias just didn't have a relationship at all<br /><br />I grew to hate Tris and Tobias's relationship. Adding onto the previous point, I just felt like their relationship was so half ass. Except when they were making out, they didn't act like a couple. They didn't treat each other like equals. There were still plenty of times when they didn't clue each other in on their thoughts/plans. They just didn't feel TOGETHER.<br /><br />Maybe this is extremely stereotypical of me, but there were so many moments when I felt that Tris and Tobias should have reacted in a certain way as a couple (like comforted the other person, or sought comfort from them), but they reacted so indifferently instead.<br /><br />\\"I could stay and try to comfort him, but I need answers about my mother, and I'm not going to wait any longer.\\"<br /><br />Except when their lips were glued together, I just didn't look at them and think, \\"You guys are dating. You love each other.\\" Instead I saw.. colleagues? Maybe friends?<br /><br />I felt like labeling what they had as a relationship just brought the story down. I honestly would have preferred if their relationship was just cut from the book because it kept disappointing me.<br /><br />\\"But no more lies. Not ever\\"<br />\\"Okay.\\"<br />I feel stiff and squeezed, like my body was just forced into something too small for it.<br /><br />Because being completely open and honest with Tobias makes her feel restricted and contained? *eye roll*<br /><br />***<br /><br />Tobias and Tris had the same voice.<br /><br />In Allegiant, the chapters switch between Tris and Tobias's points of view, but I couldn't tell them apart. I often had to double check the chapter heading because I couldn't tell whose point of view I was reading from.<br /><br />I think if you're going to have alternating points of view, you have to have two very distinct voices. Tris and Tobias didn't sound or feel particularly different.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I didn't love any of the characters.<br /><br />Overall, the character development and relationships were poor. I already talked about Tris and Tobias, but I couldn't connect to ANY of the characters really. I just felt so little for them.<br /><br />Tobias on his own was weak. I remember loving him in Divergent because he was such a hardened badass. In Allegiant he's constantly doubting himself, wallowing in grief, blaming himself for everything... it got to be a bit pathetic and I just wanted to yell at him and tell him to quit with the self pity.<br /><br />I loved Christina in Divergent, but I was indifferent towards her in Allegiant.<br /><br />There were a bunch of other characters but they all felt so fleeting. They dodged in and out of the book and I never got a sense of who they were and never formed any attachments to them.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I hated how we were given two separate societies and two separate rebellions.<br /><br />It made it hard for me to figure out where I should concentrate. On the one hand we had the rebellion within the Chicago city. The factionless rebelled and are trying to take over and convert the whole city into a factionless society.<br /><br />Then on the other hand, we have the whole of the United States. With this society we have a whole other rebellion. Once this one started up, I felt like I was being pulled in two different directions. I didn't know if the rebellion in Chicago was still important, and I didn't know what to even focus on! I hated how we were introduced into one conflict, and then suddenly jerked into a different one.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The time period was weird.<br /><br />In Allegiant we get the sense that the story takes place at least hundreds of years in the future. We know that the experiments have been running for at least ~7 generations (about 210 years). But I don't think that when they started was 2013 either. It was probably at least 2050 when they started (if not later), then that means Allegiant takes place around 2260.<br /><br />The exact timing isn't important, but what is important is that the Divergent series takes place hundreds of years in the future. And yet... I thought there was so little advancement. All the tech seemed like 2013 tech. It's like advancement was stunted, but the years kept rolling by. They still use guns, normal trucks, airplane travel seems the same, etc. With all the wars and uprisings, I would have expected really advanced weaponry.<br /><br />Sure they had the serums and the fear landscapes, but that's about it...<br /><br />***<br /><br />I didn't like how the serums felt more like magic than science.<br /><br />In particular, I'm talking about the death serum. Surely this serum is like a chemical weapon, right? Like I imagine it being comparable to nerve gas. Everyone who comes into contact with it dies. And yet... Tris can magically survive it through mind power It's literally like she just willed herself not to die. I can understand overcoming fears and simulations, kind of like lucid dreaming. But I can't imagine the death serum being anything but a biological killer.. like nerve gas. And yet Tris can overcome it with just the power of her mind? O_O This makes zero sense to me.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I did not like the ending.<br /><br />Maybe some people will like it for being `powerful' or `gutsy' or `emotional'. I just didn't like it.<br /><br />[I'll be honest, I tend to hate any ending where the main character dies. It's just not how I like to read stories. And in Allegiant, Tris dies. Whenever this happens in books, I get left with a sense of \\"What's the point?\\" I spend three books reading from a character's point of view, watching them grow and change, connecting with them (hopefully), just to have them offed. Even if the conflict was resolved (in this case it was), I can't help but feeling like it was pointless or wasted time.<br /><br />But although I didn't like the ending, it wasn't because I loved Tris and couldn't bear to see her die. Emotionally, I didn't actually feel anything when she died. I wasn't upset or teary. I was only angry because of that whole `pointless' feeling. I think that just goes to show how detached I've become since Divergent.<br /><br />Additionally, I thought the ending with Tobias and his mother was so... lame... and easy. Tobias gave his mother an ultimatum. He said: stop trying to rule the city and form a treaty with the Allegiant, or lose me as your son. And she just pulled him into her arms and tearfully said, \\"I choose you!\\" Why couldn't he have saidthat to her an entire book ago?<br /><br />Also I felt nothing when Uriah died. Honestly I kind of forgot who he was going into Allegiant and he was so absent through the entire story that I just didn't care at all when he went into a coma, and I again didn't care at all when they pulled the plug on him.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Allegiant was about what I expected.<br /><br />After Insurgent, I think Allegiant was exactly what I expected it to be. I don't feel like Tris and Tobias's relationship ever \\"healed\\", and for the rest I was just mildly indifferent. Throw in a few other problems, and it's about what I expected it to be.<br /><br />I still look back on Divergent fondly, but I think overall I just don't like where the series went. I hated how it destroyed Tris and Tobias's relationship, I didn't love where the plot went, and I hated the ending Roth chose.I didn't like how the serums felt more like magic than science.<br /><br />In particular, I'm talking about the death serum. Surely this serum is like a chemical weapon, right? Like I imagine it being comparable to nerve gas. Everyone who comes into contact with it dies. And yet...

I think that just goes to show how detached I've become since Divergent.<br /><br />Additionally, I thought the ending with Tobias and his mother was so... lame... and easy. Tobias gave his mother an ultimatum. He said: stop trying to rule the city and form a treaty with the Allegiant, or lose me as your son. And she just pulled him into her arms and tearfully said, \\"I choose you!\\" Why couldn't he have saidthat to her an entire book ago?<br /><br />Also I felt nothing when Uriah died. Honestly I kind of forgot who he was going into Allegiant and he was so absent through the entire story that I just didn't care at all when he went into a coma, and I again didn't care at all when they pulled the plug on him.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Allegiant was about what I expected.<br /><br />After Insurgent, I think Allegiant was exactly what I expected it to be. I don't feel like Tris and Tobias's relationship ever \\"healed\\", and for the rest I was just mildly indifferent. Throw in a few other problems, and it's about what I expected it to be.<br /><br />I still look back on Divergent fondly, but I think overall I just don't like where the series went. I hated how it destroyed Tris and Tobias's relationship, I didn't love where the plot went, and I hated the ending Roth chose.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|(** spoiler alert ** )<br /><br />did this book break my heart? yes.<br />was it a near perfect ending?<br />...i think so.<br /><br />i think overall we've been spoiled by an overabundance of HEAs. in the world roth built, HEAs seem rare and hard won. sacrifice and growth, giving the world a chance to heal and grow (people mending people) become the HEA, not necessarily the relationship between the 2 main characters.<br />all that said, it's been quite some time that a book made me cry the way this one did. tris made the ultimate sacrifice, and while i hated that it had to happen, it made sense. her abnegation background...the legacy of her mother...her realization of worthiness due to four. it was who she was.<br /><br />i see people saying that they felt roth didn't stay true to her characters, but i disagree. for one, circumstances change people. finding out your entire existence has been the result of an experiment, and that almost everything you thought you knew was lies? there's no way you'd stay the same.<br />but love...love changes a person, too. and tris and four had been through so much together; it wouldn't have been realistic for things to stay smooth sailing indefinitely (esp seeing what strong-willed characters they both are). i love that they made it through the storm, though. love that they \\"got it\\", that they didn't let pride damage what they had.<br /><br />and, if nothing else, tris' realization of the way she and four loved one another...it's going down as one of my favorite passages in history. it was so right on, so emotionally articulate:<br /><br />\\"If we stay together, I'll have to forgive you over and over again, and if you're still in this, you'll have to forgive me over and over again too,\\" I say. \\"So forgiveness isn't the point. What I really should have been trying to figure out is whether we were still good for each other or not.\\"<br /><br />All the way home I thought about what Amar said, about every relationship having its problems. I thought about my parents, who argued more often than any other Abnegation parents I knew, who nonetheless went through each day together until they died. Then I thought of how strong I have become, how secure I feel with the person I now am, and how all along the way he has told me that I am brave, I am respected, I am loved and worth loving. \\"And?\\" he says, his voice and his eyes and his hands a little unsteady. \\"And,\\" I say, \\"I think you're still the only person sharp enough to sharpen someone like me.\\"<br /><br />I am,\\" he says roughly. And I kiss him. His arms slip around me and hold me tight, lifting me onto the tips of my toes. I bury my face in his shoulder and close my eyes, just breathing in the clean smell of him, the smell of wind. I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that's true of beginnings, but it's not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me.<br /><br />I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.\\"<br /><br />i loved this series. the sparse writing, world building...all of it. i'll miss it.<br /><br />and for now, i'm still kind of grieving.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It took me a million and one years to finally pick up The Fault in Our Stars. Honestly, I think I put it off for two main reasons: 1) I thought the cover was boring, and 2) I just wasn't into cancer books. But after reading and LOVING Maybe One Day (an amazing and heartbreaking cancer book), I knew I had to give The Fault in Our Stars a chance.<br /><br />I love how such a big part of this book was the characters connecting with a book. It's like a book inside of a book! Hazel and Augustus really bond over her favourite story and dream about meeting the author. I didn't quite expect that element and I love how it turned out.  It gave Hazel and Augustus something to enjoy and strive towards together, and that really helped them build their relationship.<br /><br />Isaac actually ended up being one of my favourite characters. He's Hazel and Augustus's friend and he had to get his eyes removed because of his cancer. I just wanted to hug him so many times throughout the book! He's such a sweet guy.<br /><br />I kind of feel like an idiot for not guessing the ending (because in hindsight I guess it's obvious), but man, that hit me like a freight train. That's when the tears came! I won't say I was drowning in tears, because I wasn't. I've cried harder over other books. But a few tears did some and I was laying in bed sniffling somewhat pathetically. I think part of me is a little disappointed that I didn't cry more (which might be weird), but oh well. Not every book can turn you into an ugly cryer.<br /><br />I think the one thing things I didn't love about this book were the characters. Both main characters (Hazel and Augustus) were a bit... pretentious. They're the kind of people that over analyze everything and meticulously pick apart common slang, phrases, and traditions. It was a bit funny at first, but it got a tiring after a while, and in general, I'm not crazy about people like that. I've encountered a few before and they drive me a bit nuts with their, \\"Oh you poor, naïve mortal, you can't speak as well as I can\\" attitude. I found myself skimming a few of the long, pretentious, \\"let's analyze the heck out of this\\" paragraphs.<br /><br />And, similarly, I never really saw Hazel and Augustus's relationship as love. Hazel and Augustus had a great, great relationship, but I mostly saw it as friendship. I didn't see a lot of sexual chemistry there. They were definitely two people of the same mind, and in that sense they fit together wonderfully, but that was kind of it. No sexual tension, no chemistry, no romance. And I would have been totally okay with that, had Hazel and Augustus not constantly called their relationship \\"true love\\" and \\"an epic love story\\" and things like that. I think I would have clicked with it better had it just been a wonderful friendship, rather than forced into a romance.<br /><br />I didn't completely hate the characters though. I loved how kind and selfless Augustus was. If you remove his pretentious side, he's really an amazing guy. He goes above and beyond for his friends, and that really shined throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall I do think that The Fault in Our Stars is a great book, and it's easy to see why so many people adore it. It's not one of my favourites, but it's certainly worth a read and I recommend that everyone give it a shot!oor, naïve mortal, you can't speak as well as I can\\" attitude.

B004M8S3Y6|5.0|Great book, well written, couldn't put it down! Felt like a sponge taking it all in, really changes your perspective on things
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game was as expected. It was detailed and fairly challenging. The scenes moved well and were tied together rather well.  The help buttons were usefully along with the menu buttons. Some of the search items were hard to find only because I didn't know what they were. I was forced to use the hint button to find them.
B00BATKPBE|5.0|It's been a while since I've enjoyed a book as much.  It gave me interesting insight on what it means to be well-born in England, well, English anyway. He seems to be one who took full advantage of that advantage and should be acknowledged for that.  It also made me somewhat envious that he was privileged to have such a superior education, specifically, referring to the tutor system.  I was totally engrossed in the first say 2/3rds of the book, and even though the rest was written extremely well, the number of pecks a &#34;peep&#34; makes, how a house fly grooms itself, and how crickets sing was not all that interesting to me. Richard Dawkins is indeed  a  one percent person of whatever, and also happens to be blessed with good looks and a very appealing personality.  One look at his parents' photo will explain his good looks.  Also, I never noticed any apparent &#34;ego trips&#34; which would have been tempting to do in an autobiography. A great book by a great scholar!  Oh!  I now must go read THE SELFISH GENE,&#34; and watch all the Richard Dawkins' YouTubes that I haven't already watched.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I first played this game on a friend's iPad. I loved it then and looked for it on an android device. It was not available at the time. I was very glad to find it for android devices now. It is every bit as enjoyable as s the one I played. I was unable to play very long into my friends game so I do not have the whole game to compare with. Everything so far has been up to what I remember.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was one of the most frightening books I have ever read and made me a lifelong King &#34;constant reader&#34;. So, of course, what happened to Danny and Wendy and Mr Hallorann after the Overlook Hotel would pop up in my thoughts occasionally. When I heard about Doctor Sleep I was thrilled! I was worried that Danny would come to a bad end or &#34;The King&#34; would leave us wondering what happened again so I was extremely satisfied with the ending. This book is not as scary as The Shining but maybe that's because I'm a lot older. I think you do have to have read The Shining before this book to really &#34;get it&#34;. The movie &#34;The Shining&#34; was actually not as scary as the book so don't just go by how the movie was. I would recommend &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; to anybody who likes suspense and close knit families and people who are able to climb up after hitting the bottom.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Not big on giving reviews.  But felt current ratings were not doing the book justice.<br /><br />Overall the 5 star reviewers nailed it.  I think V did the characters and story justice in her well written conclusion.  Of course the ending makes me sad.  Even the next morning when I remembered the ending I got weepy all over again.  Of course part of me wishes it could have ended differently but realize that like life not all stories end with Rainbows and singing. With hearing there had been some bad reviews I figured the ending wasn't an 'expected' ending so I made sure to take my time and really enjoy every page.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good storytellers have to be deeply aware of our collective human foibles, our potential for greatness, our history (what we know of it), our tendency to infuse our purposes with magical thinking, our hopes and fears of the future we could create, and our hopes and fears of each other.<br /><br />Why are we here, what can we do about it, what hope can we give our children, how does the telling of our lives become art, our art become life?  It does take a certain kind of mind to wait for it, to notice before naming, name before claiming, to savor before swallowing, and above all, to ponder and enjoy the telling of a good story.<br /><br />Silo is such a wonderful metaphor for our present day reality, for both the plenty it directly represents and - like any technology that can be ill used - the need for that plenty that darkens our dreams.  For those of us who still have the fortitude to savor and ponder more than a twitter, Silo is a fine read.  A damn fine read.

(My crankiness level way down with my husband and kids---yay!)  My gut feels great, and my skin looks better!! (Not so bumpy and red).  Now hoping for better mental clarity which I actually think has started (also taking the DHA supplement) as I am not dragging in the morning anymore, and better energy helps me think better!!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|Please peddling censored music without marking it appropriately.  Something along the lines of \\"kiddie version\\" or \\"appropriate for young'uns\\" would suffice.  Since I have kids of my own, this would be useful for when I'm purchasing music for them--and help me avoid the same for my own collection.  Thanks.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I must temper my review by saying that I never actually finished Ender's Game.  I plodded on until I was about half way through, waiting for the book to grab my attention... and then I gave up. The author wants us to believe that the main character is a brilliant 6-year old. But even a brilliant 6-year old does not think and feel and move and act like an adult. In Ender's Game, the kids do. I kept forgetting that I was reading about kids. And that made me empathize much less with the main character. The book reads like someone describing a video game. The urgency of the impending alien invasion is lost in the triviality of kids playing war games with weapons akin to flashlights instead of guns. I was just never reeled into this one.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Kind of a disappointing third effort in the series.  The first book was absolutely hilarious and so au courant that a major motion picture was the outcome.  The second book was also a fun read.  This one not so much.<br /><br />The characters are suddenly living substantially different lives from where they left off and the time frame is unclear.  Bridget is 50 years old with elementary aged kids?  And yes, there is a bit tooooo much counting of the calories and minutes spent not doing anything.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|love all three books by this author; can't wait for the next one to be published....  find the subjects fascinating

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Easy process and cheaper than iTunes!  Will watch on Amazon from now on!  And not a lot of commercials like on TV!
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Nicely built and packaged. I wish that they have a proper cable for Apple users rather than an adapter, as well as the new lightning connector.<br /><br />The built-in micro USB cable doesn't fit with the Nexus 4 case from Google, because that blocky piece is too chunky. I think that Anker should modify the design of the built in cable to match the common size of micro USB cables so that it can fit more case designs. It really doesn't need to be that chunky since you have to plug the micro USB cable back into the battery unit and it will fit tightly.<br /><br />In general, I do not have issues charging the unit. However, there were two occasions when I had to re-plug in the battery into the phone (Nexus 4) to continue charging. At below 35%, the battery would charge, then stop. I had to plug it in again, and it would charge to 41% and stop. Above that point, continuous charging was possible and the unit charged my phone all the way to 100%. However, as the unit was being used while charging, I do not know if I knocked the cable or something. So I will have to monitor this.<br /><br />I haven't pushed the battery to its limits - 3 charges of the smart phone - as it is habit to re-charge the battery after using it.<br /><br />But I do like how slim it is. It matches the smart phone size very well. And it is easy to work with the phone while it is being charged, which is important to me.<br /><br />I'm just trying to find a way to attach it to the phone so that it doesn't slip off, like velcro or something, during use.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Yes the ending to this series was not at all what I was expecting, but I thought it was a great ending. More like a real life ending than a fairytale, happily ever after ending. It was so hard for me to finish the story and hold my tears back. I think Veronica wrapped up the series perfectly.

B00E0F9J44|2.0|Sad to say, Stacey Kent, whom I have admired for over a decade, has run out of steam. This album misses out entirely on the energy and freshness that marked much of her previous work. The new songs, written by Jim Tomlinson and other members of the band, with a little help from their friends, are of a stunning dreariness and banality. The words are hand-me-downs from tin pan alley - full of wishes on stars and clover - and the melodies, well they hardly exist at all, just a mildly modulated, almost spoken, song line. They all sound the same. I have always enjoyed bossa nova but her version of it is tired and clichéd. I am happy for Stacey and Jim that they have fallen in love again with Brazil, learned some Portuguese and are thrilled by their access to certain relics of the Brazilian popular music revolution of the 1960s. But it is not because they have had some great visits to Brazil that they have succeeded in reinventing this genre in a way that will strike new chords with today's audiences. This album would make pleasant background music in a restaurant or cafe but is deeply disappointing if you actually listen to the words and music.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Tom Hardy is phenomenal as Bronson.<br /><br />I loved it! Looks like people either love it or hate it. I'm not one for weird, artsy movies, Eraserhead freaked the hell out of me and I didn't get it at all. BUT, this movie was well, weird in a way, but so is the subject, so it really is perfectly matched.  His<br /><br />Violent. At times, ultra violent. I'm not crazy about it, but it is an integral part of Michael Peterson/Charles Bronson. He's also oddly charming at times and you want to like him.<br /><br />What hooked me first - the surreal circus quality to begin. I read about him before seeing the movie, so I couldn't imagine this would be the opening. Fascinating to me.<br /><br />What hooked  me viscerally - the juxtaposition of music and violence (ala Clockwork Orange, but also so different), ESPECIALLY the opening music \\"The Electrician\\" by the Walker Brothers - slooowed down the tiniest bit it produced that oooh feeling in my tummy. Oh my god, if you haven't heard that piece, visit you tube. But maybe it's just me that it gets to. Love it. Unfreakinbelievable almost sensuous at times. Not the violence, that doesn't 'do it' for me, but it was the way some of the scenes were so expertly crafted and involving more than just the senses of the eyes and ears.<br /><br />What kept me watching: his boyish charm throughout despite his extreme and at times pointless (to us) violence. It does appear that he just likes to be violent, just as someone else might like to play extreme sports or take risks. Sometimes, it seems that there's not even anger on his part. Sometimes, it's obvious that it's fear and he strikes out, and in doing so, tries to create maximum carnage - like in a game. I actually felt sorry for him at times.<br /><br />I also kept watching to see some kind of resolution and redemption. I wanted for him to get help and released from prison and live a happy, content life.<br /><br />He is at his most content while in prison, kind of \\"in his element\\". Ithink he's one of those people who just can't co-exist in \\"polite society\\". He tried.<br /><br />Sometimes, I feel like he got a raw deal because nobody knew what to do with him.  :/

Aside from the \\"shining,\\" there was nothing connecting the younger and older Danny. Also, could never truly see the True Knot as a threat. I could not shake my image of them as polyester-wearing, Bingo-playing seniors. They never really scared me. Also, King has a habit if rushing the ending. (See Pet Semetary.)  He did it again here--taking an easy way out. Definitely not one of his best.
006202406X|3.0|I found out about the Divergent series a couple of months ago and started reading them. I could hardly put them down and was so looking forward to this last book and even the movie! I'm not sure if Veronica Roth got too involved with the movie that she did not have time to really thing about the book or not or if she maybe gave up on it, but I am very disappointed in the whole story for multiple reasons.<br />  First of all the whole concept of GP'S vs. GD's seems somewhat off as if the genetics make anyone person so pure. Also why is it that they would never see the correlation between the GD's and the fraction less. It seems as though Roth inserted that many times but then the government nor the genetic world think about that at all? Makes me feel as though they are a bunch of stupid people!<br />  Second of all both the first and second books are written from Tris' point of view and then all of a sudden (as though Roth is setting it up for the end so it is more seamlessly) this book is from both Tobias and Tris' point of view. I had to keep flipping back to the beginning of the chapter to remember which characters POV  I was reading. And after Roth made Tobias into such a man she really did make him look like an absolute child in this book. Really???<br />  The last thing that really gets me is that there is not one happy ending in this whole book! It was like well you die, you die, and you quit, then everyone moves around, and things kinda get better but stay the same. What the heck happened there? I really did not feel as though I got any real ending. Yes I understand that not everything can end on a happy note, but this just sucked!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a novel by Neil Gaiman with fantasy elements. I could say that it's a fantasy novel, but that doesn't seem perfectly right. If anything, it's a story of childhood, and many things seemed magical back then.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of our unnamed protagonist who has returned to his hometown for a funeral. While there, he finds himself wandering about until he ends up at the old Hempstock farm where he remembers having a friend named Lettie. He takes a chance and asks the resident if she's still around - although it's not immediately clear if he's talking to Lettie's mother or Lettie's grandmother. Given Lettie isn't around, he goes on to see the duck pond at the back of the house that she used to refer to as her ocean. And then the memories begin.<br /><br />He remembers a time when he was much younger and Lettie was about eleven. They first met because a lodger had stolen his father's car and had driven it down the lane. The car had come to rest near the Hempstock farm and the car thief was dead inside the vehicle. This event was followed by strange occurrences of people coming into money or money being found in strange places like inside a fish. And when the protagonist wakes up with a coin lodged in his throat, he then turns to Lettie for help. And for some reason, the Hempstock women are indeed in a position to help.<br /><br />The reason I'm somewhat hesitant to label this as an outright fantasy novel is the interesting and gradual pace that we are introduced to the more supernatural elements of this story. Instead of being thrust right into a world with magic, we instead are immersed in the history of our narrator - thus we are immersed in his childhood. And this setup is done quite well in such a fashion that helps the reader find himself right there holding Lettie's Hempstocks hand as we walk through her farmstead.<br /><br />And the ultimate &#34;villain&#34; in this story isn't even purely evil, but yet another creature acting on its nature. And that's one of the things I always appreciate about these stories as well. It's not passing moral judgement on the characters whether &#34;good&#34; or &#34;evil&#34; - instead everyone is acting on their roles in the greater scheme of things. And thus that leaves you as a reader wondering whether or not you can really look down on certain characters because they just can't help who they are.<br /><br />The tone of this book is definitely a lot like other Gaiman stories like Coraline or MirrorMask. But at the same time this is not a &#34;children's book&#34; just because the story is centered around a child - something that can also be said of many Neil Gaiman stories. I can imagine some folks in the &#34;young adult&#34; market reading this book and enjoying it while any adult will find something in this book as well. After all, we were all once children before. We all feared the dark and what mysterious things we imagined lived under our beds. And this book manages to tap into that part of our shared history.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a magical book that transports you back to a simpler time, back to your childhood and back to your more primitive or baser fears. It's elegant in its simplicity and on the whole just a wonderful read.ut yet another creature acting on its nature. And that's one of the things I always appreciate about these stories as well.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so pleased that King.com came out with a Kindle app for Candy Crush Saga. I have been playing it for a long time on my IPhone.<br /><br />I hope they will will also come out with a Kindle app for their Pet Rescue Saga game that I play on my IPhone also.<br /><br /> Both fun and addictive games. One of the best things about these games is that they are appropriate for all ages to play and I find them even mire challenging because I continue to play each level until I meet the goal without buying extra moves.

B00BIK3FAI|1.0|I downloaded the lite version to my Samsung Galaxy II tablet and had no problems whatsoever. My daughter loved the story and minigames, and the interactivity and animation are superb. So last night I decided to pay for the full app ($0.99 though it looks like it was changed to $1.58 today). I immediately tried to run the full version, it loaded up fine but after maybe a minute I get a notification saying: &quot;App not owned. It seems you do not own this app.&quot; It gives me two options: &quot;See details&quot; or &quot;Quit.&quot; If I click see details, it just opens this page, and lets me open the app. As soon as I do, I get an internal server check connection error and the app closes. If I click quit instead, the app immediately closes. Im going to contact Ohnoo, but if I dont receive a response in 24 hrs, I'll be contact ingredients Amazon for a refund. Ive never had a problem with like this with any app purchase. If myproblem is resolved, I will gladly change this to a 5 star review.

B003ZMF26W|4.0|If you tend to be a person that uses a claw grip, this is probably not the mouse for you. Being a claw grip user, I have to stretch to reach thumb buttons and feel like it's too big in my hand. Still giving it a 4 star because overall it's a good mouse. The program to set up your macros and DPI is easy to use and it's got a good amount of features. Color change makes it really easy to tell which mode you are on for your different games.
006202406X|5.0|Perhaps this is the English teacher in me talking, but if a novel is capable of getting a number of younger students to contemplate the morality of genetics and decisions that the teenage protagonists made throughout this novel, is it really a failure? No, everyone, you didn't get your fairy-tale ending, and I am a hopeless romantic myself, but isn't their something romantic about the choice to sacrifice yourself for the ones you love instead of letting someone die for something they don't even believe in? Human nature, love, and sacrifice are complex and maybe those of you who disliked this book finally got a glimpse of that complexity instead of being satisfied at seeing only the happy ending.

B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Major Jack Reacher of the US Army Military Police is ordered to secretly investigate a murder in a small Mississippi town. The town, which has an attractive female County Sheriff, has as it's economic powerhouse an adjoining US Military establishment. Reacher and the Sheriff soon link in investigating not one but a number of murders. The action is spirited, exciting and cleverly conceived. The intrusion of the midnight train on the sexual activity of the major characters leaves other hot scenes in recent high profile novels looking like amateur events. A page turner and a very good read.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|A fairly mediocre film that would work well as a midnight filler when you don't want to be bothered or worried about pressing 'pause' for bathroom or snack breaks...  You could even fall asleep with it in the background and not worry about missing the ending...
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|“Time Killer” by Todd M. Thiede is a terrifying read! The book is a crime thriller with an extraordinary plot. The ideas put up in the thriller are unique and well brought up. The main attractions of the book are its plot, the characters and the gory murder scenes that will keep you gripped all through the read.<br /><br />If you’re irritated by people who knowingly or unknowingly waste your time, how will you make up for the losses? Time Killer answers the question well. A psycho man is completely annoyed by the people who wasted his time. He is on a vendetta to revenge people who have killed his time. He charges on them a particular sum of money and in addition to it, their lives. To express his motive of killing, he writes a message with the slain’s blood which reads “don’t waste time”. Also there are two aware detectives in the pursuit of this serial killer who interestingly, is smart enough not to leave any clue behind him! The characters of Max and Jesse fit accurately in the plot with their relation bringing some relief in the intense, terrifying scenes. These detectives are smart, full of humour and quite clear in their minds. The author maintains the suspense throughout the story that keeps the eyes of the reader glued to the book. The killing methods used by the killer are quite astonishing and drags the floor below the feet. The crime scenes are well described. All through the happenings, an excitement is there to know who the killer is and what his relation with all the slain persons is. The great twists in the story keep the reader flipping the pages of the book.<br /><br />Time Killer is a well written, fast paced and suspenseful book. I am completely fascinated by this brilliant crime thriller and would recommend the book to everyone who keeps an interest in criminology. The book deserves a five star as it’s not at all a time killer (pun intended)!! It is indeed one of the best crime thrillers written ever.

It is a heartfelt reflection of families torn apart by politics, corporate greed, war and poverty. This books lends some deep insight to the plight of immigrants, refugees and their families. I have recommended it to several people.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed guessing my way through the story. The author uses a simple set of characters without all the personality complexes that makes other books distracting.

They do not try and sell you anything after you download it although if you are not patient I believe you can pay to get upgrade points.  You cannot go wrong with this one.

006202406X|2.0|This review contains spoilers.  Read at your own risk.  I will start by saying I have read Allegiant twice.  (I know, I'm nuts).  I hated it the first time I read it so I gave it a few days to sink in and thought, maybe I need to read it again to see if I still hate it... here's what I've finally decided.<br /><br />1.  As many have already pointed out the dual POV had so much potential, but it really didn't work.  I wish Roth had stuck with Tris' POV.  It's what readers were expecting given the first two books and if she had ALWAYS planned on the end she did, then it should NEVER have been narrated from Tris's POV.<br /><br />2.  The ending.  I actually appreciate and understand the \\"bigger picture\\" that Roth was trying to convey.  The problem was that it was poorly done.  There was little build up, no real convincing the reader that it HAD to be Tris and ultimately she really didn't HAVE to kill Tris to convey the ultimate selflessness.  It could have been done so many other ways.  In fact, just that Tris volunteered for an unworthy person was enough.  She didn't have to die to accomplish the idea of self sacrifice for the right reasons.  So I applaud Roth's ultimate motive, but think her execution was greatly flawed.<br /><br />3.  Plot holes.  For the ending to work it had to be THE only way right?  If I recall correctly, didn't Amity HAVE memory serum for those from Chicago who \\"went past the line\\"?  So why not just steal some from Amity and release it in the compound.  That plot hole along with MANY others makes this ending hard to swallow for the reader.  In addition, Tris wasn't even killed by a great villain.  We hardly know David, let alone really hate him...Now, if Roth hadn't killed off Jeanine in Insurgent and there was still some great power struggle between Tris and Jeanine in Allegiant that would have made for a much better plot, imo.  And I won't even get started on how many issues I have with the plot regarding Natalie (Tris' mother), Marcus, and Evelyn...<br /><br />4.  Slow pacing.  It was a bit boring to read.  I know there was a lot of information to give us about the outside world, but really, it dragged on.  The two trips to the fringe added nothing to my understanding and made it a bit more muddled if anything.  Where was all the action like we saw from the first two books?  And where are our beloved (and hated) characters from the first two?  And why not redeem Peter and Caleb?  That would have been interesting to read about and given hope that people CAN change for the better.  And personally I find it hard that Abnegation raised Caleb would be so utter selfish at the end... I kind of think SOME of his Abnegation would have come through, even if he was a big coward overall.<br /><br />So in summary I didn't hate the book.  But I didn't love it.  And I won't be rereading it a third time... I'm not that crazy.  I'm not swearing off reading anything by Roth again, but I will be very hesitant to invest so much into anything by her.  I believe she has the potential to write great stories (like Divergent), and I sincerely hope this is a hard lesson learned about the thoroughness of her plot and writing style but one that she will learn from regardless.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the last book of the Divergent trilogy. It's a must read for all of you pansycakes out there, and very well written.<br />I didn't like how it switched between Tobias and Tris in first person, considering  I got confused many times. I liked it just with Tris, but it did create a cliffhanger for the chapter and made me have to read through another chapter or two before to finding out.<br />After I read the ending, I was sobbing on my bed for Tobias, for everything he had to deal with.<br /><br />I thought Veronica is a fabulous author, and I would love to live in her world. Allegiant is amazing.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Talk about getting involved with the characters....especially Carrie. I love how the audience knows more about Carrie the rest of the characters. We what to champion her cause but we do it with cautious reserve...I don't know that I've ever been more engaged with a character in a show as I am with Carrie.....except maybe when Natalie Portman played Marty in Beautiful Girls.<br />Well written characters and a testament to great acting when those watching can be so drawn to a person in the show.

The graphics are really nice and overall the game is suitable for young children with and without disabilities.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|The series has been wonderful but it makes me sad to say that I do feel that the ending was rushed and seemed more like a cop out than anything else. I will always love the first 2 books, but Allegiant will not be a book I recommend to anyone.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game. Fun to pass time.<br />Would like if lives were easier to get without using Facebook.<br />Would recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a fantastic tool !!!  Thank You.  It helps me conveniently spend more time in the Bible, in God's word, by using many of the study plans that are available. This greatly increases my time studying in the word in an easy to use tool. I now have easy access to plans and point of views and commentaries that would be difficult to find and study and grow in my understanding with, if this were not available. I am grateful for this having been created. I can not state that loud enough !! THANK YOU.
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|Very good film. Love the retro look in this movie. Kind of gave it that true life experience. 5 stars easily
B00C1C0HS0|4.0|I liked this movie.  A new twist on seasonal holidays like Easter.  A drumming bunny and a crazy chick trying to take over a holiday. Cute
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Definitely recommend!  Not only is the writing amazing but you definitely learn a lot of lessons.  I was actually sad when the book ended and I just wanted it to continue.
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|My children liked this movie.  It was neat to see how Sulley and Mike became best of pals.  Taught my children that they could achieve anything they wanted if they kept on trying.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|AS Always, Clancy delivers a timely and thought provoking saga of what can occur as we become more technologically dependent. Great characters, flawless writing, and a book it is difficult to put down
B00E0SX118|5.0|My children love this movie.  They can watch it over and over again in one day.  I don't mind watching it at least once a day.  My three year old daughter loves the beginning where the father says, &#34;Release the baby&#34;.  So cute, a must see.
6305428352|5.0|Excellent movie. My kids love it. Wonderful story line for family movie night. Some American history entwined in good family drama.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I thought at first omg it's lame cuz other ppl played it... this game is the best ever and VERY addictive.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Item was very clean and in great condition! I'am really enjoying them and use them atleast 6x a week. Highly recommend them.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just what I needed to stream Youtube and Google Play programs to my TV.  Along with my Roku, antenna and now Chromecast I have been off of cable for three years now and haven't missed it.  I pay $17 a month ($8.50 for Netflix, $8.50 for HuluPlus) for TV on my Roku, I can rent what I want through Google Play on my Chromecast now, Youtube has tons of free stuff and I can get live sports on the antenna or on my computer through Justin.tv or various other outlets (I haven't missed an Arsenal game in the past three years I have not had cable).  Don't miss cable at all and at $35 Chromecast just made my experience that much sweeter!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Nothing happened the way I would have imagined, which was a great surprise! I was absorbed in to each character life, and enjoyed all the twists and turns of their stories,!!
B00003CXA4|5.0|One of the great movies; I love the way it shows Gandhi finding his way at the beginning, the backdrop of the those around him having their own agendas concerning the splitting of Pakistan from India after independence, the British response...Gandhi really had a lot going on during such a turbulent era in Indian history but seemed to know what to do to unify people behind him...if only to achieve an objective.  It is a long movie with an intermission...I really enjoyed it.  Ben Kingsley was amazing as were the supporting actors that played Nehru, Jinnah...Om Puri makes a cameo and even Martin Sheen is in it as a reporter.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I had already seen The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel at a theatre before I ordered it.  I never order movies (and pay for them) unless I've seen them and want to see them again (and again).  This is one I want to play again (and again).
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|First time I've played. It is fun so far but we will see how difficult it gets as we go along
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addictive and relaxing. I like that I don't have to ask people for stuff to finish quests.<br />I do not see myself giving this game up
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Telling people they contributed to your suicide after the fact is very cruel. There are two sides of learnings to this story. One, like many others said, our actions impact others in ways we can't imagine. We should always be kind and genuine to others. two, when life goes against your will, you gotta find a healthy way to cope. You can't control others and how they are but you can control how you react to it. Unhealthy coping style is one of the characteristics among people with suicidal thinking.  This is a good read for young people. Understand your actions and do not let others spin your life outof control.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game keeps you wanting to get a better score each time. it is enjoyable and colorful. I have to make myself stop or I wont get anything else accomplished. very enjoyable for all ages.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|This is one CD that you can't get enough of! Every song is a work of art and the record is a beautiful painting.<br />If you've loved Elton John since the 70's or you are just getting to know him this is one you need in your collection.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Could not put it down. This is a brilliantly written incredible and thought provoking story. It will stay with me for a long time.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|This was really well done though I am not keen on Mel Gibson but the others actors gave better performances.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I must admit this app is a lot smoother on my Apple devices. But, in the long run it will serve its purpose...I hope.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|We were unexpectedly impressed with this movie. The acting was superb.  A really disturbing reality to which the authorities still won't own up to.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait to read book 3!.  Fast moving and very interesting book.  I am really enjoying the series.  Thank You
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I'd been long for this dvd since this sequel presented in London. This production was made in Australia. It's a masterpiece of performance, and excellent stage display. I don't have enough words for it but watch it yourself. I bought some more as Christmas gifts as the price is so reasonable.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a great little game that is fun and fairly easy to learn. The puzzles come in three different sizes. Each size is a different difficulty.
0316019984|3.0|not sure this is the best gift for a child, a boy age 5, I had in mind.  Probably better suited to ages 7 and up-very intricate pop ups and long verses about the superhero...
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Judge Dredd done right. The grittiness, danger, and hopelessness of the job brought to life from the comic. I'm a fan of Stallone, but this version is Academy Award winning compared to his version!
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Nothing new, but in the fantasy genre I like that. Trained from childhood to be a warrior in a medieval setting with a hint of magic.
B004IDG97S|1.0|Even worse than Double Dragon, Mario Bros., Street Fighter, and All of the Resident Evil movies. Dredd never takes off his helmet. Never!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is one of the best shows.  Great Actors with very good plots.  Keeps you wanting to keep on watching the next episode.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book to curl up with.  It keeps you guessing what these people will choose in the situations that they are thrust into.  Very thought provoking.  I wonder what I would do under these circumstances.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|In my opinion it is way better than the book.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  I like this version because it has some scenes not in the orginal movie.
B008E5ZVBQ|5.0|The first time or two I listened to this album I thought it was a pretty run of the mill rock album. Then I sat down and really listened to it and realized just how personal a lot of these songs are to Lauri. It's a very good album. I wish the CD was available in the US.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Bought a kindle fire hd just so I could play this game an then found out that it wasn't available on kindle fire...so glad it is finally here!! Can't explain my excitement when I saw it on the app store for my kindle fire hd!! Thanks Amazon!
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I am so glad I read this book. Being a small business owner and in sales I can see how following these lessons and experience would make the world a better place and grow ones business and customer loyalty! Thank you Tony and all who contributed to it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is totally addicting!  Fun for kids and adults! So nice to have a fun, nonviolent game to enjoy playing (coming from someone who is not a gamer).
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was very excited to read the last installment of the \\"Divergent\\" trilogy, \\"Allegiant.\\" I pre-ordered it on my Kindle, and could not wait to read it once it was available! My excitement soon turned to disappointment as I continued to read. How could this author take a story so promising and turn it to utter crap?!<br /><br />***May Contain Spoilers***<br />I really disliked the shared POV Ms. Roth used between Tris and Tobias. There were often times I had to look back at the beginning of the chapter to see who's POV it was being told from. The personalities of Tris and Tobias were totally watered down to the point I couldn't tell which one was narrating a given chapter. Every other chapter is alternated between being told by Tris and Tobias. A good writer does not need to tell you who's POV the story is being told from, at times I felt like I was reading a bad fanfiction.<br /><br />The plot was substandard. I liked how the other two books addressed the dissidence between the factions, and how Tris was breaking that mold, by not taking on the personality of one faction vs. another. Wasn't the original purpose of \\"Divergent\\", to show there were others that didn't fit into the \\"cookie cutter mold\\" of a particular faction, and that they were more or so \\"free thinking?\\" \\"Insurgent\\" ended on the note that there would be an impending revolution to the current faction system, and I was looking forward to seeing what Tris's part in this would be.<br /><br />\\"Allegiant\\" focused more on the scientific experiments being performed outside the city. The story was badly put together and at times felt rushed, as if the author couldn't wait to finish and just be done with the series. The people in the city were merely \\"puppets\\" whose strings were being pulled by those at the bureau. At times, I compared this book to the movie \\"The Truman Show.\\"<br /><br />I didn't feel the relationship between Tobias and Tris really grew, or even got the chance. I was so tired of reading about Purity Wars, GD's & GP's, Serums, conspiracies, etc.. I was terribly disappointed how Ms. Roth chose around the 90% mark of the book to kill off a major character. I felt like she killed this character for shock reason only, as there was no purpose to the death. The ending was bad, and really gave no closure. I felt empty.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with killing off characters or even major characters for that fact, but her method was pointless. Also, I disliked how the twisted characters of this book all of a sudden just gave up, and were like \\"okay we'll do it your way, you win.\\" WEAK!<br /><br />Were these really the same characters from the previous books?? After reading this I do not want to see the movie, knowing how it all turns out, which is EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.<br /><br />Ms. Roth was extremely lazy, unorganized, and lacked in giving this story a feeling of depth or character and closure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is real fun to play this game. its challenging and helps me to sleep. keeps the kids busy on long drives. so many games to play!
B005USZML4|5.0|Great book I would highly recommend this book.  I love all John Grisham books..........they are awesome and good to the very end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My husband told me not to get this game. I should have listened, I can't stop playing! I always need to finish one more level.
B0053FANS6|5.0|Three movies which shares the almost the same level of entertainment  -and fun time- that every one needs. I'm not quite a fan for the spin offs but this pack deserves a place among your movie collection. Video and audio quality are superb and fans won't be disapointed. Recommended!
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|I loved sprinkled but when I ran out of levels on the other one I was sad but yeah here it is its great app
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Not just for kids. Grannies can enjoy it, too. Best free game that I've ever played. Having lots of facebook friends is important.
B00138EV8U|5.0|One of my favorite &#34;feel good-chick flicks&#34; from way back! Very touching and fun. Always wished they would have made a sequel using the original cast, but alas, they never did.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|This is just a money grab, its a terrible film with a terrible script and the same old boring jokes. Dont waste your cash!
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Very helpful when I was brewing my first batch of beer. The first section is a very concise, step by step, method for brewing (whether you're  steeping or mashing), that refers to later chapters that contain more detailed explanations of the whole process.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Does it's job and not really ugly like what some people say. I find it useful.Worth it. Go for it if you like something basic.
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|OMD sounds better than ever! This band is one of the greats from the 80's and they are still going strong.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I been looking online I guess you can not make maps on this version(to see where you're at). Needs updates. Plus someone said no diamonds on this if that is true then that sucks even more.
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|This is an easy listening set of songs. A pleasent change from the Katy's and Miley's of the music scene.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Playing on kindle fire and on Android phone. As long as my boss doesn't see me, it's great. Of course the only time he is around is when he is waiting for more lives for his game.
B002QNTNL6|3.0|Colin Firth and a recognizable British cast do a good job.  Amanda is okay.  Plot is very predictable but the film is uplifting and there's no violence; ergo pretty good in my book - especially for a Sunday night.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Great game. I played this game on iphone. Glad to see it finally made it to Android phone. Still enjoy playing it.
B00049QQHI|5.0|The Basketball Diaries (Scott Kalvert, 1995)<br />[originally posted 13Jul2000]<br /><br />There are those among us, and they are legion, who consider Leonardo DiCaprio a one-dimensional actor capable only of playing slick Hollywood leading-man roles a la Titanic and The Beach. Such should be encouraged, or perhaps forced, two watch DiCaprio's two most powerful early performances: as Johnny Depp's retarded brother in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and as author Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries. DiCaprio's career may have taken a huge turn for the stupid, but in these two films, he proves himself a consummate professional.<br /><br />I never associated the Jim Carroll of The Basketball Diaries, somehow, with the Jim Carroll whose 1985 cult hit &#34;People Who Died&#34; has become a mainstay of the classic-rock frat-house drinking party crowd. And the plot of TBD pretty much parallells the first couple of verses of the song; if you've got the hang of one, you'll get the hang of the other.<br /><br />Carroll was a basketball player at a New York catholic school in the late seventies, being scouted by the majors along with a couple of his friends, growing up poor but honest, and an aspiring writer to boot. Not the world's most notable existence, but a good one, until the flirting with drugs that he and his three friends did got out of hand. The turning point is the death of his friend Bobby (Michael Imperioli, last seen trying and failing to save Summer of Sam) from leukemia at 16. From there, Jim, Pedro (James Madio), and Mickey (a young Mark Wahlberg, in the role that took him from cute boy-band idol into serious actor-ville) descend ever deeper into the world of heroin addiction, while their erstwhile friend Neutron (Patrick McGraw) serves as a yardstick of what might have been had they stayed clean and sober.<br /><br />DiCaprio shines. Wahlberg shines. See this ASAP. Flirting with a position on the top 100 list. **** ½
B005PK57IK|4.0|I like this show a lot. It's a great combination of developed character story plots along with new plot from each client.
B000001DQI|5.0|For some reason I never had this on a vinyl album, but I am very happy yo have this as part of my cd collection.  Great music to listen to any time any where!!
B0001AUAU4|5.0|but, I love, love, love this CD - I listen to it on long commute to and from work every day - I discovered Carla Bruni by accident and after reading several other positive reviews about her CD's decided to purchase this one - I'm glad I did, very pleasant, upbeat, and many beautiful songs - after a stressful day at work, knowing I have a lengthy commute home....this is a definite mood lifter
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|As with all of her music - I am never disappointed.  This is great music and what a wonderful voice quality she has.  Great cd to listen to over and over again.
B007HJ8LOE|4.0|Easy-to-rent from amazon website, I wish the price was more in line with Redbox rentals, that is the only missing star.
B000001EGE|5.0|When vinyl albums almost became obsolete I really missed listening to Elton John, so happy to have this again in my music collection.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Khalid Hosseini has a huge reputation to live up to in my books! His previous books are brilliant, and have made me cry, laugh and marvel at human beings, we are capable of great kindness, and great cruelty. &#34;and the Mountains Echoed&#34; had all the making of another masterpiece, but the different elements just didn't come together for me. It's still an easy, enjoyable read, but didn't live up to my expectations.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|I remember how fun this movie seemed as a kid. A little slapstick and adventure in the vein of Home Alone where adults are a buzzkill and it's all about having fun as a kid.<br /><br />Then you grow up and watch the movie as an adult. I don't know if it's just because this was a &#34;kid's movie&#34; but the music and directing were pretty disappointing from this team who gave us some of the best movies in recent cinema history.<br /><br />Example: (spoilers, sort of) In the opening 20 minutes or so, we follow an adult Peter Pan in the 'real world' as a career-driven failure of a father, and the music is totally bizarre. We watch as Peter's son strikes out, losing his team a softball championship, and the music is this strange, playful melody that completely doesn't fit. Peter arrives late to an empty ball field, disappointed to have missed the game, and this same playful and terrible music rolls on. What? Was John Williams off writing a score for a better film? It's emotionally confusing to have sadness going on on-screen while the music suggests you're watching kittens tussling around in a furry ball of cuteness.  Really gets the movie started awkwardly.<br /><br />Then there's the one-dimensional adult Peter Pan who is unrealistically mean to his family, you know - to make him seem like a grumpy adult. We've got to make him fun later, right?<br /><br />Everything turns around when we enter Neverland, though - Peter loosens up and the acting does, too. Enter Dustin Hoffman (Hook) who is amazing - totally stealing the stage from Robin for the rest of the film. Geez, he doesn't even appear in the trailer!<br /><br />In the end, a fun family film, but don't rent this one for Robin Williams - he's not at his best here. Instead, check out where Hoffman takes this rendition of Hook - very entertaining.  :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really think that my rating just describes this book. It has been a great time reading this book and I hope anyone else who reads it will enjoy it, too.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If you're looking for real-life BDSM hotness....this is a serious disappointment. Apparently you have to be abused, post-traumatic, and feloniously stammering to be into BDSM. Boring...<br />....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an instant favorite of mine. I love everything John Green does. He is easily become my favorite author. I am excited for the movie to come out next year.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I love listen and reading Stephen King tell a good story. I thought this was classic King.  Couldn't wait to get to the end but didn't want it to end. Enjoyed reading
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is coo I would recommend it. if your a person who likes to be creative and be your own boss then here it is.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Unique plot, not just another formulaic Hollywood film. That said, there is a formula, but the premise is different, exciting, and suspenseful.
1476727651|5.0|Reading King is like visiting with an old friend. I've been reading king for about 30 years.<br /><br />Before reading this, make sure you've read The Shining.<br /><br />Fun story, good writing, good pacing. Good character development. I recommend it if you like Stephen King.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|made a start then had to finish it as quickly as possible in order to find the outcome.<br />really enjoyed it..
B00CM03H4C|5.0|I love this album. Great music. Great audio snippets from the movie. Highly recommended. Also consider the Moulin Rouge soundtrack.
B00785P2QC|1.0|This game looks and operated exactly like Virtual City, except the screen is cluttered with ways to waste money and it moves way too slow. G5 puts out some entertaining games, and I completed Virtual City, but this one's no good.
1781162646|5.0|Don't let the name Stephen King scare you away on this one.<br /><br />I really, really enjoyed this. I've read it twice and gifted it twice. Really good story. Not a \\"scary horror\\" book as King is for some reason known for (I don't personally feel that King even writes horror).<br /><br />GET IT!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love this season so far always on the edge of my seat, can't wait for the next episode to come out
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey has been praised and panned, but it's first and foremost a hot, entertaining read. It's the first book I ever read in this genre and I loved it.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Classic movie from 10 years ago. Was great to sit and watch iwth my daughter. Can't wait to see Monsters University!
1883011159|5.0|The publishers chose well in combining these books, because people will buy the edition just to read &#34;Grapes of Wrath&#34;. The other books, &#34;Harvest Gypsies&#34;, &#34;The Long Valley&#34;, and &#34;The Log from the Sea of Cortez&#34; are far less known. We read excerpts of these lesser known works in a Steinbeck class that I took at Stanford University several years ago, but I've never gone back to finish them. However, I have read &#34;Grapes of Wrath&#34;  numerous times. It's such a poignant story of a difficult time in our country's history, and memorably captures the struggles of destitute families to survive the devastation of the dust bowl in the Midwest. This hardbound book is of the highest quality with a nice binding and ribbon book mark. If you are a fan of Steinbeck, it's worth owning the entire collection.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Movies cute, of course. I giggled, despite not being in love with with the title. We giggled and enjoyed it immensely.
B000JCSBU0|1.0|i absolutely regret that i wasted $ & even one second of my life looking at this pile of trash. thank goodness i'm not depressed or suicidial.....the old woman's part in this probably would have done it for me!!! GGGHHHHHEEEEZZZZZ!!!!!!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Cute production of Repunzel. Typical princess story-damsel in distress, finds a man, gets lovey dovey and suddenly everything's fine in her world, but cutely done, non-the-less
B00F91RYL8|4.0|love a good zombie flick & these zombies are quick!!! wish there was a little more story w/the wife & interaction w/the kid who was orphanded.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Like I think most parents, I was hesitant to buy my daughter the Monster High line of movies. Mattel's Barbie movies are awful and sickeningly shallow, if you ask me. I couldn't expect much different from Mattel being behind Monster High.<br />I was wrong. We actually can sit and watch the Monster High movies with my daughter without wanting to scream. She loves the storyline and I really love the Monster High message of &#34;Be You, be unique, be a monster&#34; I love what the dolls and the line stand for and the movie follows suit.<br />One of the movies in this one is a school sports competition, Skulltimate Roller Maze. The girls work together and it teaches teamwork while still having fun.<br />The other one was one I was a little nervous about-Ghouls Falling in Love? Don't get me wrong, ghouls deserve love too, but I was leery that it was going to be one of those 'girls need a man to live' movies. It isn't. It's a message of friendship and love.
0240815807|5.0|I am a complete novice at this and the book isnt for those who are clueless. But its a great guide non the less. Bc I bought it, I have some things to study up on before I can begin to fully comprehend.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|How blessed are they to still have such a beautiful gift . Not many people can hang on to their singing voice at their age. I think they sound as good as always. So sad their brothers have departed. Yeah , the best American band ever. That's no easy feat. There's been so many.. The Band, CSN, Eagles, Little Feat, Grateful Dead to name a few. But nobody harmonized and wrote such feel good music in such large volume as these guys . This album is the perfect album for anything...road tripping, working in the yard, hanging with friends or kicking back on a beautiful day with my sweetheart. And if it is a bad day , just listening to this turns all that around.
0393312836|5.0|It came as fast as it said and was just the way it was described. This was a book that a junior needed to read for junior project.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|Bitter sweet hearing them chatting with each other in the studio 45 years ago knowing Dennis and Carl have passed on. I like it and am sure I will love it the more I listen.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Love this app but ppl need to stop crying about it not working on their older tablets...it's a huge hd program and works best on newer Devices ...it's just that simple and giving it a low rating just because you are trying to run a program not meant for a dinosaur tablet isn't fair to the developers nor customers able to run it
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I know they had to re-record some parts in the studio due to short-comings in technology in the 70s, but in this case I don't care. This is a high energy Wings album with some beautiful tunes as well. I became a Denny Laine fan back about that time because of the guitar work he did in the band back then. I wish this came with a lithograph of the inside art work as did the album.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Tioo hard to get diamonds and uses energy fast but still a lot of fun.  Wthat a challenge and so addictive.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|Katy Perry has been consistently good in what she does, her last album had many #1 and top 10 hits and this one probably will have a few as well. Roar is the anthem track on this album showing that Katy is not a one album wonder.  All the other have flavors of past songs with new touches, but nothing in a bad way.  I enjoyed it as will other fans of this talented artist.
B0014DQSG2|3.0|Watched this with my 9 year old daughter. I like the theme of family over career-wish it was that easy for the rest of us.
B003CHGV74|5.0|This is an incredible TV series!! Give the writers and the actors all awards!! I am in love with Bryan Cranston!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm really disappointed in this book.  Did we get closure for all the characters?  Yes. Did everything get explained well and you know where everyone's future is headed?  Yes, for most.  Did we get a happy ending? No.  Did the main characters get their happy ending? No.  Do I hope the movie goes a different route than the book after reading book 3?  Absolutely!<br /><br />This book series was so amazing and promising! I told all my friends it's better than Hunger Games and I was so thrilled that they chose to pick it up on my recommendation and read it.  They will all be upset with me after finding out how it all ends.  Other than the one obvious thing that I hated that happened in the book, it was a great book.  But why do that to that character?  I'm so upset, I seriously am done reading for a while, this isn't a book hangover...this is a book hanging!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I am a huge fan of TPG and pre-ordered this album - I knew I definitely wanted to add it too my collection.  I've listened to it non-stop since it arrived yesterday.  Their love and passion for music is front and center on every selection.  Once again, TPG have raised the bar for holiday music ... but they do that to every song that they record.  They picked a nice assortment of songs and added their special musical touch to each.  This CD will be played year-round ... this isn't a 'holiday only' CD!
3836538725|3.0|I bought this book after seeing Salgado's eloquent interview about it on Brazil's Roda Viva. Although he is one of my photography heroes, I was disappointed in this work for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Too Much / Poor editing - This is my biggest criticism. The book is over 500 pages.  Many times the same subject is beaten like a dead horse. 150 of the best images would have made more impact. There was little value added by the pages that contained multiple images per page. In fact, it detracted from the book by showing inferior images in an inferior context.<br /><br />2) Layout - As other have pointed out, the majority of the images cover two full pages. The crease in the middle is not optimal for viewing experience. A landscape or square format would have been more appropriate for this book.<br /><br />3) Lack of a message - I'm not quite sure what message this book is trying to convey.<br /><br />4) Lack of new perspective - For example, I did not feel Salgado brought a new perspective to the typical US postcard landmarks from Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon, Grand Canyon, Arches National Park, and the Green River.
B00E9P959O|5.0|They did a great job mixing this album.  It is like listing to a new RUSH album. GET IT GET IT GET IT.
1476727651|5.0|I never read &#34;The King's&#34; horror books!  He writes too well and I'm a big scaredy cat!  But my son convinced me to read the Shining and I did so in the daylight hours only!  I'm really glad I did because it was great!!  So when he suggested I read Dr. Sleep, I thought why not!  By page 10 I was hooked!  This is story telling at its best!!!  The plot is addictive and the characters are flesh and bone!!!!  I dare say I &#34;might&#34; have enjoyed it more than the shining!  I say might because the Shining was the egg and I love chicken!  One cannot come but for the other.  However, I was tempted to re-read Dr. Sleep as soon as I read the last page!  That never happens with me!!!  And I've read the Stand!  Go figure!  Once again, I genuflect to &#34;The King&#34;!  In the event he reads this, what happens to Abra???????
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Honestly, I can't tell you why. I can only guess because it is well-acted and well-written, but even then I don't know why it is engaging. By all accounts, it should be incredibly boring! And yet, at the end of each episode, both my wife and I are reaching for the remote to queue up the next one.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I was not a fan of this movie, it just wasnt what I was hoping for. I was expecting some more action, interesting plot, could have been done better.
006202406X|5.0|I understand why everyone is upset. I was upset at first too. However, the more i thought about it, the more it made sense. Tris would never allow someone to die instead of her. She proved that in both previous books. To those who say her death was pointless or had no meaning, didnt pay attention to the book. She states why she took her brother's place.<br />I know everyone wanted a happy ending, but not every book has to have a happy ending to be good. V Roth didnt owe us a happy ending either. We owe her as fans to respect her choice to end her books the way she wants to. Especially after all her success. She even said that she always planned for it to end that way.<br />I think once people have time to think about it (and calm down) they will see it ended the way it was supposed to. It may have been sad, but it was beautiful. An ending doesnt have to be happy in order for it to having meaning or value.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I am a huge zombie movie fan, have been long before walking dead was around. This is an excellent zombie movie, it will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I loved this book it was an amazing story about how when your determined you can do anything.<br />I recommend this book to anybody that loves stuff that about the future or you want to know about how to prevent disastrous things from happening, read this book!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've played many games on my phone &amp; Kindle for a couple years now. Usually I play a game for only a week or so before getting bored. But Candy Crush is so fun &amp;  addicting that I can't stop playing. I've been playing for months now &amp; can't stop playing!! Love it!!!!
006202406X|1.0|Warning! Spoilers in this review! Really, though, don't even bothering reading the book and make up your own ending after the first two books. I feel I just wasted the past two days! It is the worst book/ending to a trilogy ever! The first two books were awesome. I don't know what the hell happened, though, because this book is AWFUL!!<br />The book speeds through parts - scenes with Tris and Tobias mostly - instead of using dialogue, Roth would just summarize what happened in a paragraph. She also adds stupid extra scenes (like Tobias with the first attempt at the GPs in the compound... That totally did not need to be in there! It did directly affect the story in anyway shape or form. Everything ended up going exactly the same way before and after it happened. Skip that part and develop the characters and story. Don't just throw in useless action and speed through important parts). Scenes are just thrown in at random (like the first time Tris and Tobias are really alone and kissing) and the characters seem really flat.<br /><br />The epilogue is useless! I don't feel like I received any closure. Who cares about some zip-lining adventure at the end of the book?! That is supposed to make the readers move on? That took up pages and pages and the death of one of the main characters ends with a scene of a ghost and NOTHING about the reaction of dead body, the memories erased, or any of the immediate things resulting from that event? We just skip over to Tobias getting a hug from his mom? WHO CARES!?!? I mean it just seems like Roth decided she was tired and out of ideas for Tris so she just kills her?!<br /><br />Ugh!! Beyond frustrated!! Read the first two books and imagine your own ending for the third.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This is a collection of diverse songs rather than a unified album, but that doesn't distract from its enjoyment value. There are more thoughtful lyrics than in many of his previous works. Paul doesn't seem to be afraid to show some vulnerability in this relatively tranquil time of his life. Love the synth-pop and experimentation with his voice in &#34;Appreciate&#34;. Also, check out the wry little love song, &#34;Looking at Her.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like playing this a lot. It can be a little addicting. It freezes on my phone after me playing usually 3 lives though.
006202406X|5.0|This book was amazing, even with the sad ending, and let's face it, this story had no happy ending coming for it. yes, of course we all wanted the protagonists to live happily ever after, but the writer was mature and told the story instead of giving the fans everything they wanted. That, my friends, is the mark of an excellent writer, not giving every story a happy ending so they get great sales by love-crazed pre-teen readers. Sometimes, a story matures into an unhappy ending, and even if the world is saved for everyone else, not everyone in the story can have a perfect ending, least of all the ones who fought the war against the evils of the story. Of course it was horrible, of course it was sad, of course it was heart-breaking for those of us who love and trust these characters like real people, but it was the story that needed to be told. The author is a vehicle for a story, and this story didn't have a happy ending. Get over it. Lots of brilliant books don't have happy endings, or lose important characters or separate lovers in the last moments. His Dark Materials (Golden Compass series), The Inheritance Cycle (Eragon series), just to name a couple popular book series that did NOT have happy ending and yet are considered excellent books by their fans. It may take us a long time to be able to re-read this book without feeling sad, it took me a long time to re-read the 6th Harry Potter book after Dumbledore's death (I, at the time, vowed to never read it again) but in learning to cope with the death of a beloved character, I learned a lesson of how to deal with losses of ideals and dreams in real life too. That is the purpose of this book, to show that strong people are remembered by their deeds, even in an imperfect world where everything we do may not matter on a grand scale, it still matters to those who loved us and those we leave behind. I will always love this series for the strength it gave me during a difficult time in my life through Tris's choice to join the Dauntless, to forsake her family and everything she had ever known to be her own person after trying for so long to be someone who she never could be. I loved this book for it's quiet, waiting, lost and tired pace, it's airport setting (a literal waiting landscape, so perfect a setting for the tone of book). I loved this book for it's small romantic bits, not light enough to be insincere or clumsy, yet not heavy enough to be smut or trashy. I loved this book for telling us that we may be different and we may be technologically advanced, but that no one can tell us that we are better or worse for what is inside of us, our genetics or ancestry, only for our deeds.  I loved this book for it's stark and dark contrast to the previous 2, but still following the story and sending us all on a ride to it's shocking, but necessary ending. Yes, I loved the ending. Yes, I cried reading it, but I knew immediately it was for the best and that it was the story that needed to be told. I loved the subtle nature of it, not long and drawn out or gory, but simple, clean, and fast, just as the character always was, in life and death. I was sad, I was devastated, I was heartbroken, but I knew the ending was perfect as I read it, and I wouldn't change a thing, not even to satisfy my own heart. So don't listen to the pre-teen haters who will tell you not to appreciate the gravity of this story just because it has a sad ending. Don't listen to those who will tell you the ending is wrong, when they aren't the author, were not the vehicle for telling the story like she was. Don't listen to those who will tell you not to read this book because the pace or the tone is not what they wanted. I say read, read and appreciate, and learn, and let your own mind and heart decide if it was worth your while to read. Most of all, don't be afraid to love a story just because it ends or didn't end the way you wanted it to, any less than you love a person because they lived a different life than you wanted or died before you thought it was their time. I say love the story for everything it is and isn't.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it is a fun game but freezes a lot.<br />unlike a lot of other games, it allows different ways to obtain the special currency (this case acorns) instead of HAVING to pay real money.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting plot twists. You think you know what's going on but you don't. I would recommend it. The ending leaves you wondering and allows for the possibility of a sequel... Like when you think the monster is dead, but then it opens it's eyes!!!
B000FBJHT4|4.0|The Day After Roswell is a standard for any UFO enthusiasts collection. The book was monumental for its time. Mr. Corso was the highest ranked military official to go public with what really happened and the details were shocking. He held a very high security clearance and his service records speak for themselves. He didn't need the $ or the fame and only stood to lose by coming forward with this information. Everything that he claims makes sense from a strategic standpoint and the claims, as wild as they are, DO make perfect sense when told from the eyes of an &#34;insider&#34;.  Although the book is nearly 20 years old, it is still very relevant for today.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. I love playing it. Every level is a new adventure with new ways to play. My children also like to play. Young play at any age.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is so simple to navigate unless ur a Neanderthal. I literally have my 2nd grader check the forecast for the following day to decide an appropriate outfit for school. Lots of accurate info, more than I ever use. However, it's not bulky.
0399230033|5.0|What a fun book! My daughter just turned one, and looks like she takes after her mom who loves books! This is one of her favorites. I think it's because I enjoy reading it to her and she can sense my happiness while reading. Highly recommend this to be added to your child's growing library!
B008GWOVB8|5.0|One of my fav classics!!!  The movie is awesome and I find myself singing along every time I watch it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I thought from some of the other reviews this would solve my netflix streaming problem, but it just crammed up my hole. It was too big, I just kept pushing thinking it was just a really snug fit but, it never got all the way in. My wife was helping me and she just kept asking me \\"Is it in?\\" over and over. Found out I was putting it in the wrong hole, haha whops.<br /><br />Great product though.
B008EAWRPY|5.0|I love this journal! It is nice to have something to write in before bed at night. I really like the variety of questions. There is no need to come up with a topic. The question is already there you need only provide the answer. Some are very simple and others are more thoughtprovoking. I love it!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I was super ecstatic when I saw this and got it. Now I'm not too happy after attempting  to play several days in a row. Yesterday it worked great, today it sucks. I can play one round just  fine but the next round after that it gets r e a l l y  s l o w or freezes and then takes me back to my home screen.  Of course it also takes a life when it does that and if I'm winning the round when it boots me out, well let's just say I'm extremely not happy when I finally get back into the app.
B00EMZYBWC|5.0|Amazing !! Drake is a genius. His lyrics are awesome, his flow is great, and it is some captivating music
0439023513|5.0|The book series opens with Katniss Everdeen in her home talking about how run down it is and how she hates the cat her sister loves.  The end, is similarly uncomfortable (not a happily ever after) but a more real, bitter-sweet, ending that I felt was totally appropriate given the general tone of the novels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Candy Crush is on my Kindle!  I think I did not happy dance when the ad popped up.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I love this album. It satisfies all my metal needs with hope, compassion, incredible lyrics and perfect melodies. I am a Dream Theater fan, and this album did not disappoint.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My two year old grandson loves this puzzle.  He gets really excited to pop the balloons each time he finishes one.  It is a nice app to have on my Kindle Fire and it helps the kids with physical dexterity and problem solving.  It's fun and educational for them and free for me!!  Will download all of them!
B008V2THJE|4.0|The ending is unclear. Overall a very good love story. I enjoyed it and the beautiful sights highly recommend it
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|even though it has the most special effects of the whole film series, the story gets a bit confusing and the overindulgence of cgi wasn't really necessary. i think they tried to do too much in this one,
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At first I thought that it was too easy, but as the levels increase you have to be more thoughtful on how to fill the space. It is addicting and a good brain workout.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Boy, how this made me cry. Harold is on a journey, but the inner journey is what this is all about. He just keeps on keeping on and solves the puzzle of his own life with every step. This is an epic journey!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I LOVE the first season of this show, so i was extra happy that this season did not dissapoint.<br />It brings out some of your worst fears, There are good twists, and the show stays true to its darker side =)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a gangster game try it out n u well like and have fun playing at first I did not like but know I do like
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I've never been great at summarizing books, because I end up giving too many spoilers, but this book is worth the read and the buy. After finishing it, I just feel like once again John Green has pushed me towards being a better person.
B00FGJNS72|5.0|I tried another mobile office application but couldn't retrieve my document through my PC. This one not only lets me send documents back and forth between my PC and 7-inch Kindle Fire HD, it also allowed me to retrieve documents from the other app.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This was an on the edge of your seat realistic depiction of the story. I love horror flicks and it takes a lot to make me jump and get chills. This one did for me! A must have for my collection...Would watch it again and again!!
B00005N6KG|1.0|Very expensive bad qualit I don't recommend. It's very serious very fragile and very deception the sound is horrible don't have bass
B008Y212PI|3.0|Interesting and fun game. Wish there were more levels though! It was a great way too spend a few minutes while waiting on appointments.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only thing that would make this game better, is if you could get all the bonus's and boosts on your tablet that you get on thecomputer
1476727651|4.0|Okay I have to admit that I have never read The Shining, and never really understood what that term implied. Having seen the original as a youngster many years ago it didn't occur to me. Having read most of Mr. Kings thrillers of the past fifteen years, and knowing his writing style, I figured I wouldn't be left to much in the dark with this sequel. I am really impressed by the story line and the depth to his characters. I have a fairly big urge to now read the original, as well as watch it again. Nicely done.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had read about the Cinderella story of an unknown author hitting the big time with this book.  It's a superb read - creative, entertaining, suspenseful.  Congrats to Mr. Howey on making it in this tough industry!
B00FN8HS5O|4.0|Heading pretty much says it.  It is a good listen throughout, and the climactic punch is amazing.  I dig it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|After reading many disappointing Stephen King books in the last several years, he's back to top form with Dr. Sleep.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I found this app to be most enjoyable for young and old ages to play. You get to play with your favorite ponies like applejack, pinkie pie, fluttershy, and so many more. K think this great!!!!!Good job to everypony!
B004OC07N0|4.0|I read this a while ago but it still sticks with me... very practical and easy to implement guide on how to deal with a major transition in your career.
B009FN0XD2|3.0|I can honestly say this was not a horrible movie, but neither can I say it's the best movie I've ever seen.  The concept is Sherlock vs. his deranged brother, who after a bullet wound to the back paralyzes him, goes all Tony Stark and builds himself an 'Iron Man' suit to give him is mobility back.  The brother then goes wacko, and starts building machines to terrorize London, the best one being a giant dragon that goes torching parts of London at the end of the movie.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Its Motorhead. If I have to explain, you will never understand. A new Motorhead album makes life good. Lemmy hope you are feeling well.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Reminds me of frontierville, farmville, and those type of games just with the ice age characters. You don't need to be connected to the WiFi to play which is really nice.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|So my Kindle recently died....it was two years old, so no big suprise I suppose. So I'm getting my new one all set up only to find out that I have lost all 500+ levels that I had completed on this game. Why can't they save it by your email like other apps do? they only option they give is to sign on w/ Facebook, which I don't have. I'm not sure I want to used this time bandit again. not if you spend time....and some money....to keep going only to lose it all??!!!!
B004HF0PEU|5.0|The majority of these performances antedate Arrau's Philips discography dating from the early 1960s.  He recorded two<br />Beethoven piano concerto cycles: the set with Alceo Galliera here is quicker, livelier and more virtuosic than his 1964 Concertgebouw set with Bernard Haitink with one exception: the concerto #4 with Haitink is slightly preferable at least<br />because of the RCOA but the both conductors employ medium speeds and Arrau is quite poetic in both versions. I prefer<br />the Emperor with Galliera-more dynamic and exciting, but also recommend Arrau's live version with  Boston/ Monteux in<br />#5 and Munch in #4, recorded at the Tanglewood Festival.  Of the nine Beethoven sonatas,I prefer the Waldstein and<br />Appasionata here to the later Philips versions.  The earlier sonatas are equally good, especially opus 10/3, but I<br />do prefer the profound opus 110 and 111 on Philips slightly.<br />The Schubert on Icon is excellent.  Most of it was not re-recorded. Best are the Wanderer Fantasy and the three<br />Klavierstucke D 946, of which #3 is especially mesmerizing (although Michelle Boegner's version on MHS remains unforgettable.<br />As with his Philips versions of the Brahms concertos, Arrau is more convincing in #2 than #1.  In #1, his first movement is a slow maestoso<br />upon which Arrau insisted strongly. I prefer quicker tempi, e.g. those of Serkin/Ormandy and Szell, Fleisher/Szell,<br />Curzon/Van Beinum and Szell, and Kovacevich/Davis.  The Weber Konzertstucke  and the Schumann Carnival are quite lovely,<br />but the Schumann concerto is too slow for me c.f. Haskil/Otterloo, Fleisher/Szell, Kempff/Kubelik, Frager/Kempe, Serkin/<br />Ormandy  Kovacevich/Davis and Argerich/Rostropovich.<br />The Chopin sounds more attractive to me than the Liszt, but I must recuse myself from that discussion, do not know<br />them sufficiently.<br />All in all this Icon set is quite valuable, I believe.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book with my 10 year old grandson in mind.  I read it first and I'm glad I did!  Well written, lots of lessons imbedded in the story.  As it turns out, my grandson's teacher is reading this to her class.  He's thrilled that he can read along with his own book.  Definitely recommend Wonder!
B004GKMU12|5.0|I admire Roth's power if expression he writes the most perfect English sentences. I am non-native speaker and he reminded me on my favourite Hungarian author, Sandor Marai.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive and entertaining game.  I have heard people complain that it's too expensive but I am on level 123 and I haven't spent a dime.  I will not pay to play even though they throw obsticals at you, you have to be patient and keep on trying.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I absolutely hate this book. The first two were so great! I couldn't wait. Now I wish I would never have read it. Truly terrible ending. Terrible.
B008OHV5W8|5.0|I read a review for this cd in a magazine, and I am so glad I looked for it on amazon. It's great to put on to relax and zen out a bit when my kids are in school. It's a great way to learn about different musicians and singers I never even knew existed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Got it as a B-day present to myself on my kindle!!! Loved it that much on my phone I had to get it on my kindle too!!
B004TACMZ8|1.0|First thing I noticed was the very limited viewing angle of the screen, i mean you have to almost be straight on with it to see it.<br /><br />Second it doesn't locate electrical wires very well I could get it to locate them at all.<br /><br />After the dewalt scan tool failure and now this, I think I'm stuck to brick and motor stores so I can test the scanners out before purchase
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Keeps me in touch with my fb friends and can take it anywhere. Always live the challenge I get when playing this game
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I added this book to my list of &#34;have to read before I die&#34; as I judged it worthy of that distinction. It is a classic and I am glad I read it. Having said that I would not add it to my list of &#34;books to read more than once&#34;. It is probably unlike any book you will encounter so go into it with an open mind and just let the story take you on a wild and twisted ride. My plan now is to discuss the story and style with others who have read it, and hopefully gain some better insight into what might have possesed Vonnegut to write in the style that he chose. It is a journey through time and shifts the reader back and forth so hold on and enjoy it.
B00C5R8364|5.0|He is up there with the Best. Keeps you on the seat of your pants. On a scale of 1 to 10 a definite 9 ( No one is a 10 except Bo Derek)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Well worth the time and self-reflection it invokes. I would recommend this to anyone who is questioning their plight in life and to those who &#34;think&#34; they know!
B00358ESI4|5.0|Wonderful movie. Every high school student should be required to watch &#34;The Patriot&#34;, &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34;, and &#34;We Were Soldiers&#34;. It can possibly give them an idea of what they have and who died so they could have it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Loved reading this book. Was intriguing as Grisham always is. Hours of entertainment. Would recommend this book to any a nd everyone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The distinction between the two classes is pronounced and vivid. Yet the similarities of emotions and feelings tie them together as one large family, showing that as human beings we are all cut from the same cloth.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I got it for myself and it was a great deal and I would buy it again if I needed another copy.
B00915G6R6|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys smart, witty, entertainment.<br />The acting is quite proficient and the writers keep you guessing.
0385349947|4.0|Great book for professional working women who want to succeed. Also recommend this book to men who work with women to understand women's difficulties and points of view in the professional setting. The product was delivered on time.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|What can I say? In spite of listening to several rings over the years on CD (Solti, Bohm, Karajan, Krauss, Furtwangler) I have never owned a DVD (Blu-ray) set before and watched it all the way through. I've seen individual operas from Barenboim and Levine DVD's before, but neither really struck me. What tipped the scales for this one? The Machine. If you order this set, please start things off with the documentary \\"Wagner's Dream\\" (included) before moving on to the operas. You'll have a serious appreciation for Robert LePage's vision for the sets and overall look of the series. It's incredibly exciting to watch \\"the machine\\" express itself over 17 hours, in addition to seeing the lengths the Met went through to make sure the public got to see this production. Great cast, great orchestra, timeless music.
B00CRGZMUI|2.0|and I've never not cared about Bridget.  At this point I just don't care if I finish the book.  Yes, it's had some laugh out loud parts but it's so tedious to read.  I hate the format. Lazy writing at it's best. Probably Mark being gone is the biggest reason I just don't care how it ends.  There's no suspense over the new guy, I don't even like him.  Couldn't care less.  Sad.
0062238868|5.0|Chris does a great job of detailing what life was like as a Navy Seal during the IRAQ war.  It is very interesting to read all the political BS they had to deal with while still doing their jobs.
1623650003|4.0|This first book in the Commandant Verhoeven trilogy has already garnered a lot of advanced praise - including some comparisons to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. And though I think this is something of a stretch, this is certainly an inventive thriller. Lemaitre sets up the plot meticulously and unravels it in just the same fashion. And though this causes few surprises to the actual storyline, it is a surprisingly well-balanced novel. Grisly violence comes at the heels of dialogue with humour and levity. And with a complete plot, the book feels more like a standalone than the start of a series. Perhaps like some other mystery series, it will not be the crimes that continue between books, but just the characters.<br /><br />The French setting for this police procedural adds an element that will interest readers who are used to the ins and outs of the American legal system. It adds a certain level of freshness to the procedure. It is a fast-paced novel and a genuinely fascinating read. Though the translation leaves a bit to be desired - inconsistent verb tenses and shifting perspectives somewhat bogs down the pacing in places - I am definitely looking forward to future installments in the series.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|Virtually all athletes are forced by the aging process to retire around the age of 40 or thereabouts.  The creative powers of the brain likewise are greatly diminished around the same age.  It seems to have happened to all of my favorite singer/songwriters:  Bowie, Elvis Costello, Sting, etc.  That being said, there are several melodically interesting and catchy songs.  I hate to say it, but there is nothing on this album or any McCartney album since \\"Tug Of War\\"/\\"Pipes Of Peace\\"-- each with a couple of songs exhibiting somewhat superior melodies or lyrics-- that are in the same ballpark as \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Yesterday,\\" \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" etc.  Some of the \\"New\\" songs are pleasing to the ear, however, my favorite being \\"On My Way To Work.\\"  If you revere Sir Paul (as I do) you will want this album.  And even more admirable than the songs of The Beatles is his unflinching vegan lifestyle and animal rights advocacy which demonstrates his power to reason and act selflessly in accordance with a superior moral world view.  Paul is a cool guy!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very engaging throughout the book. The conflicts and triumphs of Ender and his associates were easy to relate with and empathize with. Very page kept me wanting to read the next.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Such an amazing album. I always love there music. Though the cd before this was not my favourite. I immensely enjoyed this cd. I am so happy!! Davey Havok is such an amazing lyricist.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|This movie was not as good as the first one.  The story line drags and never picks up in my opinion.  If I was you, I would buy a used copy.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|I found this movie incoherent, which turned out to be OK, because I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. There were nice colors and some explosions, and the voice of Leonard Nimoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book captivated me from beginning to end. Takes you on an emotional roller coaster. An absolutely brilliant read by a brilliant author!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best thing that has ever been made in mankind's history and now its on the Kindle! :D
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I did not get to read this book in high school, and jumped on it recently when I saw that it was on the free books.  Beautifully written, I hope that schools these days make their students read great classics like this one!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|need more rooms! only goes to level 10. I wanted t play longer cause I'm hooked! hopefully they will have something more soon!
B00ET47USI|3.0|This game was a bit too busy for me.  I will be removing it from my Kindle.  I think it would be good for younger players who like all the busyness.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like that you can pick it up anytime, anywhere and just start having fun with it.  The only problem I've found so far is that sometimes the game thinks you want to jump instead of turn. Lots of fun!
B005LJITS0|5.0|A good rendition of the green lantern. I was very happy with the story line and how the film played out.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|very enjoyable. graphics are done well. if you enjoy hidden object games this game. is worth the time. whether you are looking for a challenge or just a good storyline to follow.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|It's hard to give a fair review of this book without making it very long. In short the book is great. :-) This book shows you the light that you knew was there, but couldn't see. Sure, it offers insight such as the daily practice and more, but that's not where I think the true value is. Loving your family, smiling, taking a risk. Those things sound simple, but people get caught up in the past or the future and miss their whole lives going insane. Choose Yourself teaches you the basics of life, the essentials that you need for whatever it is you want. This book lets you be the person happy in traffic making best of any position you're in. All the negative reviewers wanted some magical Mrs.Cleo insight or \\"secret to success\\" for their life, but are pissed off they could't find an easy way out. Life is hard, there's ups and downs, but at the end of the day if you try, if you're consistent, if you're honest, you will get better and eventually succeed. I will re-read this book a couple of times because even though some advice such as \\"the daily practice\\" may sound easy it does take effort to implement.
B00ENYCQX8|1.0|I was looking forward to finally having an Epub program on my Kindle Fire so I could read my Epub files. Unfortunately this program crashed the first time I tried opening it. I had to restart my Kindle just to delete it since it froze it entirely. NOT what I was looking for.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I guess I'm showing my age but boy you just can't get enough of the 80's! Phil Collins is a great performer and always comes through!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|There is nothing I detest more in the morning than a jarring, screeching alarm clock. I no longer have that problem and the memory of the awful awakening has almost faded to nothing thanks to this wonderful, gentle alarm clock. I love choosing a soft, caressing melody to awaken me each morning. I'm happy, not angry. Also there are times when I HAVE to get up and for those days I use the option of doing a math problem. By adding 4 + 7, for example, and entering 11, I have reached a complete awake state and I'm still happy.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this app highly enough. It has brought peace to my mornings. Thank you!!!!!!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Humorous, great read. I loved his lists and how e tried to analyse relationships  go read it now  Worth reading again.

B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel has been one of my favorite singers for many years. His old songs will never die. He has a unique voice and easy on the years.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King has always been able to create characters that you root for and those you despise and long for their demise. He has accomplished this once again. The characters resonate and the story is King at his absolute best.<br />You won't want to stop till you've finished. Long live the King!
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is a great continuation of the Ladies of York. I felt for Elizabeth of York and wanted her story to turn out better for her but knowing history, it did not happen that way for her. I enjoy the way the author weaves history and fiction together to make you feel that you are witnessing those events.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great!!! Can't stop playing it. I love it!!! All My Facebook friends play this game. Glad it finally on my Kindle!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Perhaps it was the anticipation, I've been waiting almost 2 years, but I feel it was blah.  Too many serums and inoculations and GP vs GD, the twists and turns were all predictable.  If you are like me, home sick and the cable/internet are out it served its purpose, otherwise it's a bit of a disappointment.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Good game to pas time. My kids enjoy the dinosaur sounds as well as making them move. Do not like iap'$ though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is so much fun!  It is very challenging especially as you go up the levels.  I highly recommend it.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Excellent movie! I often joke that it's the perfect combination of ponies and feminism. =) The blu-ray disc has a lot of really great special features that include some information about the real Penny and the real Secretariat
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I have seen more television than I care to admit, and without a doubt, this is the greatest show I have ever watched.<br /><br />What started as a darkly comic morality play slowly descends into a tragedy of operatic proportions. I have never seen the like. This season is fantastic, building upon the pieces before and offering arguably the single most intense minute of television ever produced, fantastic nuanced character studies, and award winning performances.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this show enough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addicted.  Very fun and a good way to fill some time.  Can't wait for more challenges.  If you like puzzle games, this one is for you.
B001684L0A|5.0|While there are one or two liberties taken, this is a fantastic adaptation of a facinating biography of one of the greatest minds in the founding of the US. For anyone looking to see unique and (mostly) accurate portrayals of the events leading to the American revolution and the humble figures who started it.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love this show and after binge watching all 7 seasons online, I had couldn't wait for season 8, with season 9 starting so soon!  It didn't disappoint. Great characters, funny and interesting plotlines  and to top it all off - handsome actors. What more could you ask for!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Such a masterpiece series cut woefully short. An amalgam of science fiction and western tropes (think Cowboy Bebop) with an ensemble cast that makes everything work. Witty, poignant, stunning, everyone should watch this series at least once.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game and plays it alot.  He says game is just as comparable to XBox version of the game.  Spends hours on it till I make him shut it down.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|The concept has seen numerous iterations, but the basic mechanics are always the same: worlds pump out ships at a steady rate, you send those ships at other worlds, and conquer the galaxy.  The important features are in the details:<br />worlds are linked to each other (by the titular &#34;star links&#34;) and ships can only be sent along those links.  No random assaults coming from the opposite side of the galaxy here - there are distinct front lines of battle.<br />Some worlds have special features, like increased production rate or decreased rate of sending out ships, which helps to create desirable targets and limited avenues of attack.<br />The most important feature about Starlink is activated abilities, such as the ability to destroy a starlink, to temporarily halt an enemy fleet's ability to capture your world, or to give one of your fleets vastly improved combat effectiveness.  You only have a limited number of ability points to choose the abilities you want to have available during a game, so there's a lot of combinations to try out, which helps keep gameplay varied.  My only complaint is that it makes you grind for ability points - you get xp after a game which levels you up.  I don't really care for that mechanic, but others may disagree.<br /><br />Oh, and the map generator isn't always balanced.  It's entirely possible for one player to spawn on or right next to one of those worlds that has double production rate, which is a major advantage at the beginning of a game.  But eh, It's Galcon.  Not like it's Civilization or something.  The occasional imbalanced start isn't that big a deal.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|app says I do not have enough space. I deleted everything on my kindle and it still will not download. how can you not have enough space when you delete everything?????
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD has lots of big hits included plus many that may become your favorite.  Adele's voice is amazing.  A good find.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a fun game, but annoying that play is often interrupted for you to buy more lives or wait for increasingly long periods of time for the game to unlock so you can continue.PLEASE. just charge for the darn game so we can play it already. I'm so annoyed I bought another similar game.
B000F9RB8A|3.0|No Subtitles spanish in this bluray ?? Only english and cantonese :-( but  all ok i have in my hands
B00B1DC2FQ|3.0|One of many Schleich, Papo and Safari LTD dinosaurs in my sons collection, this one is not lacking for detail.  It's also not made of the same material as Schleich's other dinosaurs.  This one is much more rubbery and flexible.  The legs, arms and tail have a lot of flex so they should be very resistant to breaking.  We haven't broken any of the others yet, but this one seems well suited for young play.<br /><br />Scientifically, this one is a bit lacking.  Based on fossil records, the proportions are a bit off all around.  Head too big, legs to beefy, arms too long.  Still a good toy, if not completely accurate.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|the Croods was a GREAT FAMILY movie!!! my kids and I loved it. We watched it twice in one night. lol
B0073RSVMC|4.0|One of 7 Schleich, 1 Papo and 1 Safari LTD Carnegie dinosaurs that I have been buying with my son.  T-Rex is pretty awesome. He's big, heavy, and has the typical exquisite Schleich detailing.  The lower jaw is articulated and is pretty sturdy, especially when compared to the sloppy jaw on our Papo Spinosaurus.<br /><br />There is some debate about the accuracy of this T-rex sculpt.  The tail is a little short, the arms are a little long and pronated, and the head is supposedly not quite right.  it may not be perfect, but I am pretty happy with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Because it's  fantastic,because it's a very good app enjoy browsing through it ,recommend to all my friends and family members
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved hearing about the time period between the start of 30 Rock and her brief time on SNL as Sarah Palin.  After reading her book you can see she has used her life before and during SNL into the script of 30 Rock.<br /><br />I've talked to my boyfriend about what I have read and he's pointed out even more similarities between her life and the scenes in 30 Rock.  I would definitely buy whatever she comes out with us.  The only problem I had was that the beginning was slow for me and it took me a while to really get into the book.  I know the spot that it started to pick up for me--the pee jars.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like it how the minions react when it falls done in this game but I do not really enjoy
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I wasn't expecting the writing style of this book.  I read it after seeing the movie previews and figured it would be a straight lineal story line.  I really like the fact that it is really a bunch of stories from people around the world and how they explained World War Z.<br /><br />Everything seems very realistic and I love the thought process behind the fact that our modern war equipment did not help us at all with getting rid of them.  That was one of my favorite scenes in the book, other than the submarine section.<br /><br />Overall a great book and I can't wait to see the movie, even though I don't believe it will do it any justice.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I finished this last night and afterwards I felt just dead inside. I absolutely hate when a series ends leaving me feeling unsatisfied and even, in this case, angry. I feel kind of betrayed by the author.<br /><br />I loved Divergent. The book had its faults, but I really fell in love with the whole story, the characters, the romance between Tris and Four, the Factions, etc. I read and re-read Divergent probably 8-10 times. I bought the audio book version as well. I was SO PSYCHED about the movie! I bought Insurgent and devoured it as well. It didn't have quite the same magic for me that Divergent did, but I still loved it. So I was REALLY psyched to read Allegiant.<br /><br />And maybe my hopes were too high.<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />That doesn't change the fact that this book utterly and completely disappointed me.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />For real, SPOILERS!<br /><br />READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br /><br />[<br /><br />**What's outside the fence?**<br /><br />I was really excited, after reading the 'cliffhanger' ending to Insurgent, to find out what was outside the fence. I had my theories, and I was right about some, wrong about others. I was expecting the cameras and Truman Show-esque thing, but I was not expecting all the genetic manipulation crap. As soon as our heroes get outside the fence, there are chapters and chapters of info dumping and, to be honest, it's kind of dull. We learn that Chicago (and some other cities) were created as 'experiments' because of genetic manipulation gone wrong. Supposedly these cities were an attempt at creating more 'genetically pure' people (aka Divergents). This is so far-fetched and bizarre, but I was willing to go along with it.<br /><br />**Tris and Four**<br /><br />I wasn't against the dual perspective, though once I finished the book I realized why she HAD to write it in a dual perspective. However, I don't think it was done well. There were several times where I would get halfway through a chapter and not remember who I was in the head of at the time, mostly because the two narrators had identical voices.<br /><br />Tris has always been an interesting character to me. I really liked that she was tough, but a little vulnerable and naive. I liked her progression through Divergent and Insurgent. She doesn't really progress much here. We've always known Tris is a selfless person who is more than willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good, or for her loved ones. That doesn't change here. More on that later. She does become kind of arrogant and holier-than-thou here, and it really started to bug me. She's 16, but she often acts (and everyone treats) her like a grown-up. She is pretty much always right in Allegiant and she makes sure everyone knows it.<br /><br />Four was awesome in Divergent. He loses all of that awesomeness in Allegiant. He becomes quite whiny and pathetic to the point where I actually wanted Tris to break up with him. She probably should have, considering some of the stupid and completely out of character stuff he does. I really hated seeing him reduced to this quivering mess of a boy who does nothing but wax poetic about his mommy and daddy issues. Four was always strong, and he is the polar opposite of that here.<br /><br />I did enjoy the progression of their relationship though. Some people have complained about the scene where Four accuses Tris of being jealous, but I actually liked it. I like that they, FOR ONCE, acted like TEENAGERS. Unfortunately that was a tiny part of this book, and for the rest of it they act like 30-40 year old worldly adults.<br /><br />**THE END OF THE CONFLICT**<br /><br />So we have Four's mother Evelyn running Chicago like a factionless tyrannical dictatorship. Johanna and Marcus running the Allegiant, trying to reinstate the factions.<br /><br />Evelyn has been portrayed as a nearly heartless person, hell bent on making all the Factioned people clean toilets like the Factionless had to do for so many years. At the height of the conflict, she is willing to allow a &#34;Death Serum&#34; to kill pretty much everyone in Chicago in order to avoid going back to the Factions. This is when Four arrives and says &#34;Hey Mom, I'll be your son again if you stop acting like a monster&#34; and she goes &#34;Okay.&#34;<br /><br />She then negotiates with Marcus and Johanna. Marcus wants to take over as evil dictator and Johanna says &#34;Nah, you're not gonna do that&#34; and Marcus just says &#34;Okay.&#34;<br /><br />Conflict over.<br /><br />WHAT?<br /><br />WHAT????????????<br /><br />**Mass Murder**<br /><br />Roth has not shied away from killing off characters in the first two books, but I felt like most of that had a purpose. Tris' parents in the first book, Al (due to the guilt over his own actions towards Tris), Jeannine in Insurgent, and more. Deaths in Allegiant come just as rapidly and have even less meaning. Tori dies in a very sudden manner, and then is mostly forgotten about. She was referred to as the leader of the Dauntless, but she is killed and then is nothing more than an afterthought for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Uriah's death is given a lot more page time, but only as a way to make Four feel like total garbage for getting involved in the rebellion and to make Tris &#34;right&#34; once again.<br /><br />The biggest death of all was Tris, and this was the biggest disappointment to me. I will be straight up honest - I LIKE a happy ending. I read YA because I like knowing that things will most likely end up happy overall. I read romance because I know there will always be a happily ever after. HOWEVER, I can deal with a bittersweet ending so long as it feels satisfying and feels like closure.<br /><br />Tris' death was NOT that ending.<br /><br />Caleb's betrayal was a huge part of Insurgent, and that continues on in Allegiant. He has a LOT to atone for in Allegiant and when he volunteers for the suicide mission to help save everyone, he does it because he wants Tris to forgive him. And he doesn't want to live with the guilt of what he did. Instead of letting him, Tris forces him to let her go instead. I understand this. Tris forgave him and doesn't want him to die because he feels guilty. I get it.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />Caleb doesn't get that opportunity to redeem himself. While I understand that Tris acted the way she had to act, that doesn't mean Caleb can't take a bullet for her. That doesn't mean he can't force a redemption. Instead, Tris dies in a completely unsatisfying scene that left me going &#34;WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED?&#34; Caleb lives and basically still is the coward and traitor.<br /><br />Caleb NEEDED to redeem himself. He needed to take that bullet for Tris and die.<br /><br />Instead, we get this messed up ending where Caleb lives. Peter lives (gets his mind erased BY HIS OWN CHOICE and gets to start over). Marcus lives (just disappears somehow). David (Tris' murderer) lives (also gets his mind erased and even though he's an evil murderer, no one cares because he doesn't remember). Almost all the bad guys live and get to have perfectly happy, normal lives.<br /><br />This is NOT SATISFYING.<br /><br />THIS IS POINTLESS.<br /><br />Sorry, but this book was awful. I wanted to love it. I REALLY wanted to love it. I was willing to deal with all the weird genetically damaged stuff. I was willing to deal with the complete dismantling of Four's character. I was willing to deal with a lot, but Tris' pointless and needless death... NOPE. This death felt like it was here for shock value only. So the author could be &#34;edgy&#34; and &#34;different.&#34;<br /><br />Unfortunately, all she did for me is ruin the entire series. I won't be re-reading Divergent or Insurgent anymore. I won't be re-reading Allegiant. And I definitely won't be seeing the movies that I was once so excited for. Knowing how depressingly it ends ruins it all for mes. At the height of the conflict, she is willing to allow a &#34;Death Serum&#34; to kill pretty much everyone in Chicago in order to avoid going back to the Factions. This is when Four arrives and says &#34;Hey Mom, I'll be your son again if you stop acting like a monster&#34; and she goes &#34;Okay.&#34;<br /><br />She then negotiates with Marcus and Johanna.

I won't be re-reading Allegiant. And I definitely won't be seeing the movies that I was once so excited for. Knowing how depressingly it ends ruins it all for me
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Since I've been obsessed over a book.  Sad, I know.  I even ignored my young children to finish this book.  I absolutely LOVED it!  I'm going to download another of her books right now!
006202406X|1.0|I would firstly say that I am a big fan of the series. I picked up this book when it first arrived. I waited for the 2nd and enjoyed it and then I waited the conclusion of the series. Upon reading the book cover to cover I felt victimized. It read more like teenage fan fiction rather than an established novelist. I feel that the first two books were very strong and mature but this one was not. It read again like a teenagers fan fiction. I think that Mrs. Roth could have created a very wonderful wrap up to the series but instead opted for a rushed, messy and chaotic end to the series. I tried to understand this ending and how it flowed with the overall themes of the story but in the end it does not make sense.<br /><br />There were some very wonderful surprises in the book. There were very well placed comedic aspects and evil themes and characters. It certainly went a little dark but right when it was hitting its stride it would revert to fan fiction. You can tell that there are some things that felt very forced. There were some character choices and backstory that seemed more forced and were just there to appease a small group of fans.<br /><br />She tried to make it sort of like George R.R. Martin's book series, but it did not work out well. I feel there must have been some studio influence into her story telling and the overall narrative and flow of the story. I rate books on if I would recommend it and re-read it again and for this one I just don't see that happening.<br /><br />I wish I could rate it better but I don't feel that it could be justified.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B008602KQI|4.0|Compared favorably with the books. Got the whole story in a compact movie.<br />I quite enjoyed it although I am not a big movie goer.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Made my kindle freeze then die. I had to restart it but even after that it still wouldn't work and the 2nd attempt froze and crashed the kindle again. :/
B009WUBERW|3.0|It was action packed, but Stallone is too old. He has been an overacking hack for years and is in his worst at his age now.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very quick paced compelling read. I couldn't put it down. Kept me guessing right to the very end. Would definitely recommend to others.
0374531269|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Best book that I've read in a while. I had to pass it along to my friends to read.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'll add my voice to the chorus of those who are outraged by the ending. If Roth wanted to ‘shock’ her fans, she succeeded, but not in a positive way where fans would loyally purchase any of her future books.<br /><br />However, my disappointment in this book transcends the conclusion. The plot and character development was so shoddy – completely different from Divergent. Any emotional investment I had in the characters disappeared while reading this book. Roth may have wanted to create characters that are not black and white, but grey – we are both good and bad, depending on our intentions and perception – but I feel the result was a gradual disinterest in the characters, as none seemed to fully evolve into someone I could love or hate.<br /><br />I don’t want to unintentionally reveal spoilers – but I did want to warn fans that the plot for this book was so disappointing compared to the first two.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A follow-up to one of the most famous horror books ever written—so no pressure, right? King does a fine job though and pulls off something raw, creepy, and fast-moving. I appreciated the fact that, while I did read the Shining a few years ago, I didn’t have to reread it just to keep up with this sequel. It picks up from the beginning, makes a smooth and elegant transition, and sets you off on a great story. In truth the book might have been worth five stars but I was a little put-off (just a little, mind you) by some of the homogeneous dialogue. Like many Oscar Wilde’s characters, King’s cast members were all witty and spoke with an unvarying cadence. Not a big deal, though. Certainly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very addicted to this game. The only bummer is I don't have facebook so I have to wait for timer to go off so I can have more lives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for any age.........my kids love it! They have real . Life horses so they really enjoy taking care of the horses
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I want to play a game and quit when I want without bothering my friends for lives. Also the program did something to my kindle fire where it would not charge or work right. So I deleted it and now my kindle works fine.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Gabriella by Alan Hardy is an excellent book and to use the authors words to me. It is bawdy and saucy. It is all of that and more.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this humorous story about the gorgeous aristocratic Gabriella and how she handled the men in her life and the game of cricket. The characters are all very interesting and/or hilarious and with the story-line that keeps your attention and smooth words from the author the pages just turn themselves.<br /><br />This book made me blush more than once and is totally scandalous and marvelous. A witty and clever read that I found very bawdy and saucy and I have quite a few people I will recommend \\"Gabriella\\" too.<br /><br />5 stars Alan Hardy I'm glad I bought this book
B00BD99JMW|5.0|An unexpected ending to an amazing trilogy. Extremely riveting and you won't wan to put the book down!!! Better than I could have ever imagined
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Im glad i am finally able to get candy crush on my kindle. Now waiting on pet  rescue saga.thanks alot
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|We use an alarm clock and cell phones for our alarms, but when we feel we need an extra back up this works great. We also use it when we travel. The free edition works just fine for me. I like the alarm sound choices. Some are very soothing and make waking up easier than the jolting beep or loud music of an alarm clock.<br />I wasn't sure how this app would work when I turn my Kindle off, but it indeed goes off. Love this free app..it's a keeper!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing, can wait till Google launches more apps with it. Its been great for streaming off of chrome as well.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I found the book easy to read and it kept me entertained.  I was hoping that as I read through the book that I would come to care for the characters or at least one of them.  It turns out that I never did end up caring what happened to them.  I've been told that I should read the subsequent books because they are better than this one.  I can't really see that happening.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It keeps me entertained and challenged. The one thing I do not like is that it only allows so many attempts. It then will time out and you can not play for a given period of time.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As usual the combination of science and writer's imagination have created another fast moving thriller! Awaiting the next thrill ride.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS APP THE SIGNATURE OF THE GAME WITH THE LITTLE OUTFIT OF A HUNTER KEEPS POPPING UP AND CRASHES MY KINE!!
B005I4JG80|4.0|Entertaining and informative read! I wish I tried 'the pause' with my first and, just like for the author, it is not an option with the second..
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The recent spate of gratituitously violent fantasy books (and television shows derived therefrom) had really turned me off to reading science fiction and fantasy. I grew up reading Marion Zimmer Bradley, Ursala Le Guin and other authors whose craft depended on great woorkmanship, imagination (in its finest form) and superlative, succinct writing.<br /><br />When I immersed myself in the newest \\"Darkover Book\\", I didn't come up for air until it was finished.<br /><br />Not only have I found the same quality of writing in Mr. Sanderson's books (of which this was the best so far), I happily commend them to teachers wanting to offer great fiction in their curriculum, to book clubs wanting new genres and to parents who want their children to be intellectually stimulated (and highly entertained) yet be able to sleep without nightmares. I believe that early teens would greatly enjoy and benefit from reading this book.<br /><br />I have read the excellent \\"Mistborn\\" series and most of Mr.Sanderson's books. This author, along with Robert Sawyer, Patrick Rothfuss (who owes us \\"Day 3\\" for THIS Christmas) and a handful of women to whom I owe great reviews, are destined to be the best of this genre in the coming years.<br /><br />I think that they will play an important role in getting this generation through some tough challenges.<br /><br />I guess that I MUST wait for Mr. Sanderson's next offering; hopefully we will soon revisit this world of \\"forgers\\" and \\"rememberers\\"!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My perception of this when I bought it was that I would be able to stream anything on my PC to my smart TV using this device.  Not so.  Only supports Netflix and YouTube both of which are built in to the TV.  This is a good concept but it should enable any content on your PC for streaming.  The capabilities are overstated.<br /><br />Overhyped but it will make a nice stocking stuffer for someone over this Christmas.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like to read my kindle in bed and it's easy to set this alarm whenever I remember. Way easier to set than the old digital bedside clock. Also good is the notice telling in how many hours the alarm will go off.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I feel like I won the random book lottery! A fantastic science fiction book that I had never heard of, this was right up there with Enders Game. Good characters, engaging story line, and excellent story telling. Great read, looking forward to more.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|Premium Rush, a box office failure, was presented on high-end cable/satellite this week, and I recorded that showing.  I am a long experienced bicycler, until, year 2009 at age 73, Parkinson's took some toll.  I paid my respects to Amazon by ordering a BluRay edition of Premium Rush, as I continue to wheel, indoors on this calm day, a valuable Schwinn BioDyne recumbent exercycle which I highly recommend taken through Amazon Prime.  Activity is longevity.  Live, pay taxes, shop Amazon.  The logistics of filming Premium Rush in New York City were daunting to put it mildly, and this film might be viewed for that heroic accomplishment alone.  There's also a neat cap at film's conclusion when the bent NYCPD detective (Michael Shannon) is cooled with a paperback-book silenced pistol shot to the head.  There is also Quicksilver (1986), in which Kevin Bacon plays a San Francisco bicycle messenger.  Clinton Williams, Oakland, Michigan USA
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This DVD is amazing, the package contains background on the stars, crew, and the beautiful location in Austria.  Although I see yearly on tv, it is still fresh and it is true record of the Von Trapp family during the occupation of Austria. Loved it very much!!!!
0937381888|5.0|Whether you just want to make the beer or really understand the science behind it, this book will serve you well.
1592536913|5.0|This is a lovely picture book of the state of Steampunk at the time of publication. There's clothing, home decor, weapons, art and dustcatchers. Some of these images have escaped onto Pinterest or other websites, but there will be much you have not seen before. There are no instructions, but some of the projects are well-illustrated enough for inspiration. Just don't let the level of craftsmanship make you feel that you can't make fabulous stuff too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and great for kids although the graphics need to be better you will love the game so so so so so so so so so s o so so so so so so so so so much
006202406X|1.0|The audiobook for Allegiant was terrible.  The narration by Emma Galvin and Aaron Stanford (reading as Tris and Four, respectively) was as flat as Veronica Roth's prose; the narration actually improved once I bumped up the speed to 1.25x.  Like Mockingjay, the 3rd book in the Divergent series appears to have been rushed and the ending is absolute trash.  If you want your faith in YA Dystopian fiction restored, read The 5th Wave by Yancey.  You'll feel a lot better, especially after wasting your time reading this book.
0143119680|5.0|I'm not a lover of &#34;magic&#34; tales with characters like vampires, witches and demons.  So this novel, so fascinating with history, surprised and delighted me.  Although primarily drawn to the history and relationships of the story, the author skillfully used the witch/vampire component to create the plausibility of the story, and to hook me into it.  I first read it in the Kindle version, and then had to buy a paperback copy of it (because I prefer to keep my &#34;best&#34; stories in hard copy).  I still don't read &#34;vampire&#34; novels, but I will certainly read this one many times again.<br />AA
B000H0MKGK|5.0|A more mature look at the struggle and pleasure in life.  Only two songs don't love but overall a great album.  I hear it everywhere now.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|My son loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and now getting to put a movie with it he absolutely loves it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is super fun!  looking forward to more rooms. I def recommend it as a great brain teaser and a way to kill some time.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I'm glad they're back, sounding this good and to think, they're all in their 60s!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing and totally worthwhile addition to your collection. I bought the cd deluxe so it has an extra 3 trax on a seperate cd!!! It just ROCKS!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|The author walks us through the trials and tribulations of a horribly disfigured child. The protagonist seemed a little too mature for a 5th grader, but I can forgive that. It is nice to read a story where the good guy wins, and a loving family makes a difference.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Interesting mix of history and magic intertwined with a complicated love story. Has some choice language in it, but keep in mind it was written from a teenager's point of view. It was an engaging, sometimes witty, fast read.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Would have given 5 stars but not so crazy about a few of the tracks. Was planning to see  her in concert and wanted to be familiar with her latest work.  If you love Bonnie you will like this CD.
0679809015|3.0|This book had the potential to be a big hit with toddlers, but it is so very small that the cuteness potential on the inside and surprises under the MINI flaps is diminished dramatically.<br /><br />This pictures and text work well together, it is just that the book needs to be doubled in size to make it perfect.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|What is the point? People destined to be together throughout eternity? Or is it trying to explain why on occasion I feel like I've known someone forever when I've just met them. Either way, the cast, special effects, and fascinating story lines kept me interested for the most part. But at the end, I just felt that something big was missing. I have no interest in religion so I could only assume that perhaps the writers might have been vaguely saying that some powerful and oftentimes cruel, godlike figure might be controlling the characters in the story (for their own good???). I don't know. The older Tom Hanks got the beautiful and ever-youthful Halle Berry. I guess that's something to celebrate.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book has a very compelling plot and sub-plots, and I very much liked the author's commentary on how things could have been different with the slightest changes -- which is something that has always interested me.  I think this would be a very good book for a book group.
B003V1WTMM|3.0|Had a hard time with this book--it was a slow read.  Liked The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden MUCH better.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Well developed, unique characters I quickly cared about. In fact, I have thought about them even after finishing the book.  Once I started reading, it was hard to stop.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I am an older guy and heard some of her music and an interview on NPR.  Fell in love with her and her music.<br /><br />The sound engineering on this CD is awesome. All instruments can be clearly heard and the movement of sound from right to left creates a nice affect.  Would recommend the entire CD.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Great to have when you are traveling. We download our pictures every evening so that we can view on the larger screen of our iPad
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|I only listened to the samples on this page. Nothing inspired me to buy this album. I haven't purchased a Paul McCartney cd in so long I don't remember the last one I bought. I keep waiting for another Band on the Run or Ram. After so many dismal releases, I would settle for just a one hit wonder to be on a cd - it would give me reason to buy it. After reading all the reviews I have to say that although he is 71 yrs old and his voice has clearly felt the impact of his aging, I feel no obligation to purchase his music just because I was the best Beatles and solo fan when their music was really good and I liked it. I have not liked Macca's releases for a long time now and was ready to give him another honest try with this album. It did not disappoint me because I didn't have high expectations. I simply choose not to buy it. If he has many loyal fans who actually like this cd, more power to them and I wish them enjoyable listen. To those fans who will buy anything with Paul's name on it - check out the \\"Fireman\\" cd's. Macca released this music using that name. Paul has released some tremendously artsy music in his career and for this I am thankful. But to me his last real music was Ram and Band on the Run. He had a few good songs here and there since, but definitely not a good album. This is my opinion, everyone has one, and like most butts, some people may think mine stinks. But it is mine and it is my honest opinion. BTW, as I am getting older, I find music is mattering less and less and other things take priority in my life. Paul should find religion while he has the time. You can't take your music and concerts with you. \\"But he just so loves what he's doing\\", you say. Love God and  your neighbor. Life is a sacrifice.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|pretty cool app! As far as I can tell its doing its job...but like I said...even if it wasn't I wouldn't know...it certainly looks like it is.
1402217722|5.0|One of Ms Heyer's best romances, with an engaging heroine, a sophisticated husband, and a dastardly relative who will stop at nothing to het his cousin's money. Tightly plotted, it moves along at a fair clip, and almost makes me wish I could have been round in the early 1800's to see it unfold.
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|I am a science-educated homeschooling Mom, and I enjoy reading books on educating/raising children.  This is the first book in some time that I requested from the library and ended up forcing myself to finish.  I am honestly surprised by the incredibly high reviews, I found this book tedious and very long-winded.  I love to read nonfiction/case study books, but this one was so dry and repetitive I found myself simply skimming pages, hoping to gleam some knowledge.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I am hard-pressed to summarize it.  I think it is saying that your childhood directly affects your future in school/jobs/life.  Bad childhood, more struggles.  Good childhood, better life.  I had to wade through a lot of numbers, case studies, and stories to find out what most moms already know by common sense.<br /><br />Don't buy this one, go to the library and pick it up!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the COLOR , ease of connecting with FB upon setting up the game, I did not miss a beat. Love it!! So glad to be able to play my favorite game on my Kindle Fire.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great! Very addictive! I'm so glad you can now download it on your kindle for free like my phone! Even my grandson loves to play it.
1470879069|5.0|A wonderful book consisting of two intersecting narratives - that of a teenage Japanese girl who is being bullied at her school, and a Japanese Canadian author (not unlike Ms Ozeki) who finds the girl's diary and has to find out who she is and whether she is still alive.<br />It can be read as a relatively straightforward mystery. but there are many layers within this book, all of them rewarding. If you listen to the audiobook, read by Ms Ozeki, you will really hear the voices of the characters, especially that of Nao, the Japanese schoolgirl. A fantastic book, and a great one for a book club.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|beautifully writen. a great work of art. this bok is life changing. it ismy favorite novel and others shoukd read it. i respect more people with cancer now and so do others.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|My grandson (age 10) and I have enjoyed watching the Dr. Who series, new version which started in 2005. We noticed the references to Torchwood and when we happened to see this series available on Amazon Prime, we started watching it (we're all caught up on Dr. Who except season 7 part 2 which is not free). He and I are both big fans of this genre and like watching this series together.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|There is so much you can do with this ap.  I like making all sorts of things in different colors and lights. Fun!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author plotted this book genuinely with both hubby's tale and wife's tale (or diary). I deluded myself I was reading soap opera of conflict between husband and wife until part two. No. This novel is not that genre. Although I disappointed with the end which was opposite to my hope to solve the case, I really sank into the story. I like the story progression and agony the author made in this book, but hate them both, Nick and Amy.
006202406X|2.0|Highly disappointed with the ending to this series. Ms. Roth should either offer refunds or an alternate ending. She's probably lost a lot of supportive readers in the last few days.<br /><br />Book two led up to a very climactic ending that I believe most readers expected to continue through at least the first chapter of the third book, but that was not the case.  The first few chapters were boring and hard to get through, even the so called 'action' scenes had no emotion. The feel of the book was completely different that the previous two, it almost felt like there was someone else writing this book.<br /><br />My disappointment isn't only in the way she ended the series, I can accept that she had her reasons. My biggest grudges are that this book felt emotionless, and empty. The previous two you could feel that the author put a lot of heart and soul into her writing-that's not the case here. There were plot holes, monotonous and repetative themes, no action, poor story planning and glaring character flaws/differences from the previous books.<br /><br /> I've read a few interviews from Ms. Roth and in all of them she says that she 'always knew how this series would end', leading me to believe that she didn't think this last book through, she knew what she wanted. If her entire point was to kill a character and prove that no one is safe, she could've done that at the end of book two and saved us all the time and money. Instead she drew it out into a pointless third book that lacked all of the raw emotion and charm of the previous two. The only reason I'm giving this book a two is because I enjoyed the other two so much.<br /><br />There are a lot of '5 star reviews' on this and other sites from individuals who haven't READ the book, but were 'so excited' for it to come out... I'd be interested to see what the ratings were if those were removed.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was very disappointed with the last book. It ended in a very depressing way. It was almost as if the struggles were pointless-very little good remained. I wish I had stopped with book two at least then there was some hope for a positive outcome. I hope they don't make this one into a movie.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was one of the most beautifully writen books i have ever read. it so realistic and it made me cry. i dont know if your even reading this, Jay. but all i want to say is that it changed me. i now see the litte things that people do that could kill someone. i cnt even explain what i felt when i was reading it. it was a great work of art. you changed me and many of my friends. we now see that little things make a big difference. thank you, Jay.

1490550623|5.0|On my two week vacation I decided to pick out 3 books to read. Cult of Mirrors caught my attention, first because of the title and second because of the detailed description of the book given by the author. I have to say I am absolutely thrilled I read this book. The characters in the book are well-developed which gives you that feeling of knowing each character. There are things in the book that will make you question people's character and other parts that will take you by complete surprise. Cheryl's life is one you will never forget.  The book is truly an awesome read! You will probably want to read it from beginning to end all at once because it is just that interesting. I did my reading when the house was quiet and I could escape into the book; I didn't want to miss a thing in the story line. The book is very well-written and I will be looking for more books by the author. If you are the type of person who loves suspense books then this is definitely a must read for you!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I think the writer uses a very pretentious tone in his writing, but it seems to fit the stage of philosophical development that the characters find themselves in as they navigate through the acceptance of their mortalities. For me, every word in this story cuts your soul like a knife. You cannot bear the anguish it causes you to experience, but, &#34;that's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Two drawbacks to the device:<br />As described only certain apps can stream to it, so no true screen mirror.<br />Image quality sometimes is not great, it seems to amplify the white in lighter colors during video play.

0307474259|5.0|Gary Taubes is changing the world with his exposure of sugar as a toxin. He shows how sugar is a slow acting poison that is being distributed by companies that sound and act just like Big Tobacco used to sound. He also shows how sugar is killing us, and spells out in easy to understand terms how it's killing us, and then he documents how to stop it. Great expose journalism combining facts and research. Highly, highly recommended. Combine with the YouTube video of Robert Lustig entitled &#34;The Bitter Truth&#34; and be prepared to be blown away.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Didn't have the Hollywood ending I wanted, but the best books don't. Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. I love that Veronica didn't write the last book to please anyone or make them walk away from this book giddy, but to make them think on a deeper level. There are a lot of lessons in this book to take away and apply to your own life.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Duolingo is a great way to gain an intermediate understanding of a language for free. However some basic knowledge of verb conjugation and grammar is required for most to fully understand the lessons, but this can be acquired for free online from places like youtube etc. Also Duolingo can be a useful supplementary app if you are learning a particular language at school. I started Duolingo when I started taking Spanish classes at school and noticed a big positive change in my understanding of the language. Unfortunately for now only a few European languages are offered. It would be nice to see other languages like Mandarin,Hindi,Arabic, and Swahili as well. Fix this and I will give Duolingo the full five stars this exemplary language learning program deserves.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I debated how many stars to give this but decided that I felt strongly enough to give it just one. It's not because of the ending. I had read about one-third of the way through when I decided to stop and put the book away. Part of it was reading the two alternating perspectives got a little confusing. Tris and Four never really had different voices so I sometimes had to check to see whose point of view I was reading. I decided to finish the book because I LOVED the first two so much. I now wish I hadn't wasted my time. Once it's read, it can never be unread!<br /><br />I wondered as I read Allegiant if an editor ever came to Roth and said, \\"You know, maybe you should think about going in a different direction.\\" If that had happened, she should've listened. But it's apparent that for reasons I'll never understand, she decided to write this mess. The dialog is stilted, Roth isn't good writing from different perspectives other than Tris', the characters never really developed and it seems like Roth didn't know what to do with some of the supporting characters so she either kills them off or they just sort of faded away and became irrelevant.<br /><br />And what happened to Four between the time she wrote Insurgent and Allegiant??? Did she suddenly start to hate him? I never liked that his daddy and mommy issues weren't resolved during the first two books but they really make a difference in his thinking in Allegiant. Four used to be badass but in Allegiant, he became this whiney, angst filled, insecure boy/man whose parents didn't hug him enough. Sadly, his character devolved over time.<br /><br />I love Tris. I'll always love Tris. I think Roth knows her best so if this is what she wanted to do to her beloved character, then it's her choice. But I think Tris' relationship with Four, despite the fact that she thinks she's in love with him, just seemed too contrived and maybe Roth couldn't write it any other way. The whole plot, the relationships that had been built over the first two books, just collapsed in this one.<br /><br />And frankly, with that ending, Roth pretty much guaranteed that I will never read this series again.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I will say at first I was like another 50 shades rip-off but i read only a few chapters and was captured....

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|the onset of the story is considered known. the acting is expressed by very good talents (e.g. N Watts). the storyline is attractive not that it would be leading to a climax since the real event was well known; but in that it unfurls from inside us the degree at which we can be caring or extremely fear for our kinfolks (i.e. their well-being) when tragedy strikes.  That is, the human factor surrounding this powerful catastrophe makes the viewer feels as though he/she (especially those w/ small children) is beating the same heartbeat for a bit of hope as the victims or enduring every minute of their larger-than-life tragedy, including every aspect of their mental chaos or even their physical demise
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As a Stephen King fan this book was on par with some of his better works.  The story not only deals with flesh and blood demons but the personal ones that can haunt you. The latter being ones that no matter how much you try to escape, you just can't. I recommend this book to anyone who is a \\"constant reader.\\"

B00DBO1YMK|5.0|What is there for me to say?  Two of my favorite things in the world: Christmas and The Piano Guys.  Both in one album.  How can one go wrong with this CD?<br /><br />Love the arrangements.  \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" and \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" were particularly stirring.  If you're looking for a good Christmas album, this is it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love, love, love Stephen King and I loved, loved Doctor Sleep. King went back to his origins here. For me anyway, Dr. Sleep evoked such memories of the early Stephen King that I almost cried at the sweetness of this book. Do not get me wrong - this novel is classic horror but it reminded me of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon or The Stand more than the classic, The Shining. King's alcoholics are sometimes awful human beings but they are still human beings and there is always the possibility of redemption. That possibility keeps me reading, and loving, Stephen King.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loving the first two books i was anxious for this one to come out. the reviews are so bad for this book. This is one of the best books i have read. The story plot keeps you intrested. although it has a sad ending the author writes it very well and keeps you captivated. Definantly glad i read this book!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|....or a Part II. Hangover was great as a standalone movie. This one had funny parts, but I wasn't even close to dying of laughter like I was on the first one. Zack G. made it slightly funny. That's about it.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really loved the first 2 books of this trilogy! I stalked the author's page for months in anticipation of the 3rd book. Unfortunately, I feel extremely disappointed! First of all the first 70% of the book was a snooze fest. But I easily got through it because I kept expecting it to get better. Secondly, Tris is supposed to be a bad ass. She sees through plots and secrets and can figure out true motives. Then how...HOW...did she turn into this boring boring character that is defeated by a man in a wheelchair??? really??? she couldn't un-arm him? She couldn't figure out a way to move around so the geeky scientist in a wheel chair couldn't hit her? CHUCK NORRIS WOULD HAVE HAD NO PROBLEM!<br /><br />Also, what happened to my Tobias???? why did he turn into this weak, dumb jock?? When did this happen?? He should have erased Marcus' memory! make him a better person and sent him to live a new life! but noooo, he just wants a hug from him mommy. Don't get me started on the whole &#34;i will keep trying to prove i am better than Tris&#34; bull he kept pulling in the 3rd book.<br /><br />Anyway, I am sorely disappointed, and for the first time I hope the movie changes the story in last installment.<br /><br />**I have no issue with people in wheelchairs, and I am 100% most are stronger than me.
0670024856|5.0|I am on the verge of calling this work magnificent.  I am astounded that anyone could have found it boring or tedious - it brought my world to a halt for the 2.5 days it took me to devour it.  The scholarship is thorough, be it in terms of science, history, geography, philosophy, and the transition and evolution of the  principal characters never failed to intrigue me.  There is decidedly a strong plot line running throughout it, and I was completely immersed in every character, idea, transition, and maturation of psychology and/or scientific thesis that occurred (though I am disappointed that Gilbert limited the presence of altruism to humans only, as hundreds of examples have been observed in which nonhuman animals display altruism and self-sacrifice not only within their own specie but cross species, as well - a big oversight and flaw in an otherwise supreme work).  This is a book that will live on my \\"favorites\\" bookcase by my bed and be read and reread multiple times throughout my life because I can see myself perceiving it (and, thus, myself) differently each time - it is a window, a mirror, to the soul.  Brava, Elizabeth!

B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is real country music and Vince sings his @ss off and Paul plays like a true master.  What a wonderful example of what country music once was, before lame 80's rock 'n roll dumbed down the genre.  Songs here don't dwell incessantly on chicks, beer and trucks, either.  There is a wide range of tunes and a wide range of sounds, but they are all country, or at least what was once known as country.  It's truly sad that we've come to expect nothing more than Taylor Swift's monotone voice or Jason Aldean's constant rapping when we turn on the radio and listen. This CD illustrates how much country music has NOT progressed over the last 40 years.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I enjoyed the first book, and the HBO series, this one is just getting to be a lot of names, and titles to keep track of, but I did just order the third book in the series.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....,\\" I was an avid science fiction reader. A 30-year Army career followed by 13 years as a high school history teacher put a hiatus on such reading pleasure. While teaching Military History, my students would often do book reports on \\"Ender's Game,\\" and their reports piqued my interest in the book. When I learned that a film by the same name was soon to be released, I decided it was time to read the book. I did so and became hooked on the Ender series. However, because I like matters in chronological order, I decided to read \\"Ender in Exile\\" next. \\"Ender in Exile\\" is the last book in The Ender Quintet that Orson Card wrote, but it follows \\"Ender's Game\\" chronologically.  I then read \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\"  It is a much different book from \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender in Exile\\" but equals them in keeping the reader's interest.  I look forward to reading the other books in The Ender Quintet.  Only one matter troubles me.  I still have some difficulty understanding why Ender continued to be so vilified for having destroyed the buggers' world.  The explanation given in the three novels I have so far read appears to be a bit thin.  After all, he did save the human race.<br />As a retired Army colonel, I appreciated the scenarios and leadership challenges that Orson Card presented. Readers of all ages and genre will enjoy \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\"

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Found this book thoroughly engaging. I was hesitant to read it at first, thinking it would be more of the Apple propaganda, but found it to be very objective and honest.<br />Jobs, like so many brilliant driven people, was quite  a difficult person to be around and this was very clear in the biography.<br />Highly recommended even if you are not in the Apple fold!

B0025KVLTM|2.0|I'm not here to talk about the contents of the album, I'll leave that to music historians, etc.<br /><br />But the album cover is too ridiculous to even be funny.  From the song listing on the back cover &#34;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely HERATS Club&#34;.  To the inner liner text &#34;Strawberry Fields FOREBER&#34;.  The color separation is also dismal.  Really, this is the quality I would expect buying the CD from a sketchy guy with a table at the flea market.
B00004RF8J|5.0|This is a fun movie. Don't take it serious, just laugh and enjoy the music. Alot of good actors in this movie as well.
0385350864|2.0|I'm going to attempt to review the book without mentioning the one thing that everyone is no doubt mentioning, but it's such a huge, gaping hole that affects the whole book that it's nearly impossible.  Anyway, I'll just complain about everything else that made this book feel a weirdly unwanted postscript to the life of Bridget Jones.<br /><br />Mad About the Boy lacks a clear amount of description with the love interests.  Roxster, as far as we know, is going on thirty and hunky with nice abs and dark hair.  That's about it.  Not really sure what he does for a job and what draws him to Bridget other than the fact she's older and he's into older women.  Also, they seem to share a sense of humor.  Mr. Wallaker is first introduced as having something to do with Bridget's sons school.  There was a mention of chess and music and I kept thinking he was a frumpy, balding, middle aged dude.  The only description that sort of changed that view for me was when Bridget sees him running and says he's pretty ripped.  Okay, frumpy, ripped, balding middle aged dude.  By the end I think that's not quite the image I was meant to have, but that's basically what I've got.  Billy and Mabel are cute additions, but make the huge gaping absence more obvious, especially when Daniel just sort pops in and out.<br /><br />This does not feel like a Bridget Jones book.  This feels like some crazy weird addendum to her life that was possibly never meant to happen.  It also feels forced and overcooked and too much like the first book at the same time.  I tore through it since enough of it was Bridgetesque to be reminiscent of previous volumes.  I was, however, vastly disappointed by the ridiculous climax and the inevitable fairy tale ending that followed on a moment when Bridget was actually self-actualized and not completely nutzoid over some guy or other.  I really liked the first two books.  I am not so Mad About the Boy, however.  Definitely have trouble recommending this to people expecting more of the same old Bridget Jones.  That it most definitely is not.<br /><br />Note: Free copy received from Alfred A Knopf via Goodreads First Reads for an honest review.more of the same old Bridget Jones.

B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I'm a big fan of detail, and I love outdoor scenery on my 52 inch HD TV.  This movie was well done and clarity was amazing.<br /><br />What is the use of HD if the camera is shaking so bad you can't make out any of the detail? The new shaky camera fad that has taken Hollywood was not present in this movie. That in itself is worth 10 stars to me!  THANK YOU for not shaking the camera!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />It was also nice to sit down with my kids and watch a good clean movie.  Very will done and kid friendly.  I highly recommend this as a movie the whole family can sit down and enjoy.

I totall get that a writer has every right to do with the caracters as she/he likes .but.com.on.!.! I just don´t get why the author desided to go down that path with the series - i lost interest in a heartbeat and will deleat the books on my phone.

Well written to include some of the hardest choices we have to make about our sexuality. Whether it be for popularity, military, family or normal every day jobs. Making the right choice for our own happiness is all that really matters. This would be a great movie! Thanks can't wait to read more of Kristen s books!

006202406X|1.0|I'm usually okay with sad-ending-novels and don't always require a \\"happily ever after,\\" but this novel just ruined the series for me. In the hope of staying brief and not reiterating everything everyone's said word for word, I felt like the ending was highly unsatisfying. The outcome of the end wouldn't have changed should Tris had died. She already made the sacrifice, already worked past the death serum, and the point was already made. To kill of a main character in that was seemed purposeless. I wish I didn't pick up the first two books in this series at all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|very good device. it's very easy to setup. However, the setup does not working with a macbook and a hidden network. I have to switch to my PC which is running windows 8.<br /><br />Other than that, all the castings are working like charm and it's worth $35.

B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Pink Floyd were the soundtrack to my adolescence. I first purchased The Wall on glorious vinyl. Naturally I got the CD when it first came out, and now this amazing box set. As one of the most demanding bands around in terms of sound quality and presentation values, I always respected Pink Floyd (and in particular Roger Waters) for producing consistently high-quality releases. So here we have the Immersion box set of The Wall. Before getting to the discs themselves, I have to note that the packaging is, as always with Floyd, magnificent. Wall-themed items include a scarf, marbles, and coasters, along with a replica concert ticket and backstage pass. An over-sized booklet of drafts of album art as well as photos from the concerts really round out the experience.<br /><br />Onto the music...the show must go on! After getting this box set, I listened to the original album's remaster from \\"...we came in?\\" to \\"Isn't this where...\\" The remastered version of the original album is tremendous. David Gilmour's guitar tracks are noticeably improved; in fact, hearing the opening riff of \\"In the Flesh\\" is stunningly fresh. On \\"The Thin Ice\\", Nick Mason's drums are much clearer. On other tracks, Roger Waters' thumping bass is solidly enhanced from earlier releases. The vocals of both Waters and Gilmour are crystal clear; Gilmour's soothing singing at the start of \\"The Thin Ice\\" and Waters' mournful tone during \\"Vera Lynn\\" are absolutely crisp. And on it goes, providing the same seamless story in a new and improved acoustic package.<br /><br />The demo discs are a treasure trove. On first listen or to the casual observer, the demo tracks might seem short and incoherent. But taken as a whole, they provide amazing insight into how the individual band members experimented with different tones and sounds to create such a seamless piece as The Wall. Gilmour experiments quite a bit over the course of the demos, and Waters plays around with the lyrics to get it \\"just right.\\" I found it quite interesting and enjoyable to hear the songs evolve from demos to rough mixes to the final album versions. Listening to the demos straight through and then listening to the remastered album from start to finish is as the title states and immersion.<br /><br />The live album \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" was previously released, but is still a welcome part of the Immersion set. The documentary \\"Behind The Wall\\" is an interesting watch, giving a much better sense of the extensive work that went on behind the production of The Wall concerts in 1980 and 1981. It's also interesting to compare the travails of those shows to Waters' production of The Wall live in the last couple years. Building the wall in 1980/81 was a tedious and at times dangerous endeavor for the roadies. How far the technology has come. I also enjoyed the footage of the original live opening where other people made to look (somewhat) like the members of Pink Floyd took the stage. Very cool to watch and a brilliant piece of performance art.<br /><br />All in all, the Immersion box set of The Wall is exactly what you would expect: a very well-produced package that does indeed immerse you into the experience of Pink Floyd's The Wall.ite interesting and enjoyable to hear the songs evolve from demos to rough mixes to the final album versions.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Been plying a couple days now, I Like this game because you can actually do something without throwing your money into these Money pit games, Highly recommend
B000GIWS7E|5.0|This is the most fantastic concert, I wish I was there. Long live Dream Theater, I would love to see Portnoy return!
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|I would put this in the YA category, and it felt like a nice easy breezy beach read. I really liked Neil and the Callahans, and even it being told in the first person, except for when he jumped to scenes he's re-telling that he couldn't have known about in detail. This novella is funny, terrifying in some aspects, and even a 3some thrown in amongst these geniuses. It has some great laugh out loud moments, and the family is so interesting that I want to know more! Looking forward to the next one. :)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I haven`t played in awhile. I had forgotten how much I LIKE the game. LIKE the UPDATES. Will wait for more
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very good series. Very well written and thought out. The writer displayed a vast knowledge of the content to help you picture it and it was easy to be in the story not reading it over the writer's shoulder like some seem. Character's were very well developed as well. I would definitely recommend.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the books and the 1st movie.  Waiting for the 2nd installment movie to come out in November.  Although billed as a Young Adult's book - I found it was very relevant to our times and situation in America.  Anything can happen and one person can make a difference.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit may not be as memorable as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's a mostly faithful adaptation that sticks to the same tones and themes of the source material
B008XG1X18|5.0|great source for sharing project ideas for crafts, gardening, decorating, etc.; something for everyone; easy way to find products that are suited to your interests.
1439193630|5.0|I also have the audio which is read by him.  love it!  It is amazing hearing his pointers and just plain history on how he got started and how it lead to the current time (of when the book was written)!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I choose the Google Chromecast because it seemed like an easy way for us oldsters to get movies streamed to our tv.  I warned my grandson (19) that we would probably need his help, but we were delighted to find out it plugged in easily and we were up and running in no time at all.  We are still in our free month of Netflix movies and we love this feature.  Our granddaughter (12) was down to visit and was able to see movies after we retired for the night.<br /><br />It was so easy to use and we are so very happy with it.  The price was terrific and well worth it.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Not many books are able to surprise me, but this one did more than once.<br /><br />It explores all aspects of coming-of-age, from childhood sibling rivalries to hormonal adolescence to adulthood and beyond. I was surprised at some of the frankness and plot turns, but it was honest and well-written. Can't wait for another novel from Gilbert.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Picture is awesome, but sometimes the signal gets dropped.  Works well most of the time.  Very easy to install and set up.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|Very funny. Naturally, there are roadblocks galore -- but the breezy film stays one mile ahead in terms of plot and punch lines.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it is now available for Kindle Fire HD. Love this addictive game !!!!! Try it you'll like it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved the way the story is written.  It is so much more detail than the movie.  Any fan of The Shining should be sure to read this book!  There is always so much more in the book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was hoping for this. Now my roommate says are you playing that game?! Want me to take it away from you at 2 AM?
0756404746|1.0|Boring, dull, longwinded, reduntant, nonsensical...unnecessary. This book would be better used in the firplace, or as toilet paper. For one thing, it isnt plausible, in a world so dreary, that someone as colorful as Kote could be mistaken for anyone else. The end, with Bast, made no sense at all. Most of it was rambling about nothing pertinent to the story at all..oh, I already said it was redundant.
B007C12RDS|5.0|It's just terrific and the acting is superb. I don't know why it took me so long to find it but  I'm so happy there are more seasons to watch!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|If you enjoyed Monsters, Inc 12 years ago then you're not going to be disappointed even if it does feel a little slight at times.
B000NY17J6|3.0|When the CD arrived.... it was opened!!  Sound quality is not real good.  Not satisfied at all with this purchase.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Good book, can't wait to read rest. I love books about supernatural, vampires, aliens, non-human intelligent beings. Semper ubi sub ubi.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Really easy to use and set up. I love using Chromecast with my phone, tablet, and laptop. They all work great!
B00006RU5B|4.0|What can I say... Like a stone is just awesome, if your thinking of getting this CD, get it for at least that one song! The rest are pretty good and others are meh, but get it for just that one song!
0803731094|5.0|Love this book, and my 3 year old does too!  I had looked at buying this one for a while and I'm so glad I did. The storyline is great and there are fun rhyming parts. This is one you won't get tired of reading over and over again. Make sure you do some fun voices for the different animals.
B003AO1SVS|3.0|I liked their two singles so I gave them a shot.<br /><br />I don't how else to describe their sound other than 'hipster music'.  I don't mean any disrespect by that, but if you hear this album you might agree.  A few catchy songs, but a lot of what felt like filler.  As individual musicians they have excellent technique, so I gave some stars.
B000002LAC|4.0|It's OK, not 100% but OK.  I was somewhat disappointed with the songs but that is my fault for not reading more closely.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|This last book in the series nicely ties up the loose ends in the overall story left by previous books. And brigs a sense of closure to the story. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is the first of his books that I've read, but I definitely plan to go back and read &#34;The Kite Runner.&#34;  The only slight problem I had (partially because I was reading it on Kindle and couldn't flip back and forth) was that the stories moved around a lot from person to person and place to place without any clues in chapter headings as to who was speaking - not a huge problem but frustrating not to be able to go back and check names, etc.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I kept this on my kindle for a bit.  Some fellow readers told me to buy it so I did but didn't get around to it for a bit.  Why did I wait?  This was a great read and I loved Drew.  I loved finally reading a romance novel from a guy's point of view.  I'm a romance reader down to my toes but I get a bit tired of the stock character females in so many of them.  Kate is a firecracker.  But Drew is awesome.  He owns being an ass, relishes his unsavory behavior reminding me of every boy I've known and loved.  He's worth getting to know and it is nice to see a girl worth loving through a man's eyes.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Needed this for my KindleFire since it does not support Flashplayer.  I think this is a great app so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game on the Kindle!! Colors are even BETTER than on my PC, and the app seems to run better on the Kindle! This game is highly addictive and working out the strategy will keep you entertained for hours!! It has been well worth the wait, thanks Amazon and King for bringing it to this venue!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I will say first that I am disappointed with the ending, but I won't give the book a bad review based on that. Veronica Roth took a huge risk with the way she ended the Divergent series, but it was her risk to take and I think the risk she took was worth  it. Yes, I am devastated by how the story ended, but we as readers can learn a lesson  from this story. Did we all expect a happy ending? Yes, but this isn't a fairy tale. This is a real life story where real life things are going to happen and death is one of those things. Losing a loved one is one of those things and moving on and dealing with the grief is as true to real life as Veronica Roth has made it in this book. We can all learn a lesson from the sacrifices made throughout this amazing, but heart breaking story. And we can all see from the epilogue at the end that there is hope and light even in the darkest of times.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I originally reviewed as a 5 star, but this was largely based upon the other two books in the series, I changed to a 2 star for this book on its own, it was depressing.<br /><br />I believe Ms. Roth must learn some important lessons if she wants to continue to be successful in a long writing career.  First and foremost, she needs to understand that this is the entertainment industry. People want to be entertained, not depressed. It is all about being able to write exactly what you want to convey you message and then sell that product to prospective readers.  Second, she needs to develop a better grasp of her target market and write to that target's expectations, thus building a loyal following of readers.  I think this book has damaged the loyalty built in the first two books.  I've read several comments that at book signings she failed to listen to what her audience has been saying.  And these are people which specifically came to see her.  Lastly, IT IS her prerogative to tell the story the way she wants to.  Although this is true, I will caution that there are ramifications to exercising that freedom, and deviating from the expectations of the target market.  This is exactly the reason why the Dixie Chicks fell from the top of the country music charts.  Their music was top notch, but what they chose to say and do (their entitled rights) outside of their music directly alienated Nashville and most country music fans. Accordingly, as is the audience's prerogative, everyone turned them off.<br /><br />I believe she owes us an explanation (and maybe even a re-write). There is so much more she could have done. She at least had the opportunity to put Tobias and Christina together 2½ years later, but chose not to do so.  That would have at least invoked a better appearance of healing.<br /><br />Added to the Review... It was not realistic to me that David had the actual abilities to actually kill Tris (as opposed to just sheer dumb luck).  First, David was a high leveladministrator, not a dauntless trained \\"killer\\"/soldier. He is used to subordinates executing his instructions. No where in the story leads us to believe that David had ever fired a weapon himself (at least not in the book's storyline).  He was wounded and had limited mobility in the wheelchair.  Plus he was fully aware that Tris was a recently and deadly trained soldier (creating an extremely tense situation).  There are countless articles available where trained police officers fire massive number of rounds in a stressful \\"firefight\\" conditions without hitting their targets, but we are expected to believe that David can fire and hit twice with deadly accuracy.  Second, if we are to believe Tris is as smart, resourceful and well trained, then her believable course of action once confronted would have been to evade, maneuver and disarm David, maybe getting wounded in the process, but not just making herself a silhouetted inviting target.
0767020308|5.0|I really enjoy the old English films and this is yet another of my favorites which I plan to add to my library to enjoy on a cold<br />winter afternoon or evening when I'm snowed in; a cup of herb tea and Emma, delightful!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I enjoyed it enough to purchase the sequel ($4), but not enough to give it five stars.  It is a fun, light hearted read, reminded me just a little of the Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Follett book.  Even though the book includes 4 different families dealing with the end of the 19th Century in England, It was very easy to keep  the stories separate, yet see how their lives interacted.  I didn't want the book to end, but could barely wait to start the second book of the trilogy, World Without End.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Very smooth gameplay in a quite clever game. Even though the market for this type of game is crowded, this game manages to feel fresh and unique. The goal is to move your telescoping water hose cart, which will move only when there are.no obstacles/fires/puzzles that still block your path. Solve said puzzles by using your water stream to trigger various events and put out the fires or move objects. Doing that then allows your cart to continue to roll right until you make it all the way to the end of the level.<br /><br />Simple yet quite challenging! 5 stars and I highly recommend it!
006202406X|1.0|I was not disappointed at the ending, it was a good way to wrap up the series.  I was disappointed in the writing! I felt that the book was written by a different author, it was so different from  the first two in the series.  No excitement, no tension, very wordy in sections, very glossed over in other sections. Plus it was so predictable- Tris and  Tobias are in love, have a fight, get back together....there is yet another organization trying to control society.  But I think the main complaint was that the book was so BORING! Had a hard time getting thru it and by the end I was like, well that was a waste of time.  The series had so much potential and the final book just fizzled. I know a lot of 4/5 star reviewers loved the book because they were probably emotionally invested in the series and main characters and no matter what they would love it, but unfortunately this book was just poorly written, plain and simple.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love finding the secret places to reveal clues and items needed to advance. This is by far the best puzzle game ever. Just wish it had many more chapters. Hope the come out with a part two. Hints are available if needed. Love this one!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I have seen parts of this on PBS and am looking forward to enjoying the entire film. Thanks Amazon for amking<br />many of my favorites available at affordable prices.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't had a book hit me like this in years.  Because of this and &#34;Hunger Games&#34; I am reading more young adult literature, a genre I have ignored for more than 30 years.  I bought the Kindle version based on the inexpensive price and high star rating, I was blown away.  Thank you Amazon Kindle for introducing me to such great reading
1594744769|5.0|Full of fantasy but a fun read nonetheless, this was a book club recommended read, it was a used book but the quality was very good
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! Love this game! My 7 year old son and I love playing the levels together. Fun way to pass time.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I placed my order for Supernatural Season 8 DVD on October 10th.  It is now October 24 and I still haven't received it.  So I went online to Amazon to cancel the order today.  And then I get a reply email telling me it is too late to cancel because it has shipped.  So in the space of about 20 minutes, my order went from \\"we are processing\\" to \\"we are shipping,\\" and it is too late to cancel.  I never expected such poor service.  I guess if I had tried to cancel a week ago, they would still \\"all of a sudden\\" said that it had been shipped.  I ordered a 30# bag of dog food at the same time I placed this order, and it arrived within 4 days.  But a little thing like a set of DVD's takes over 10 days (or more)? What ridiculous customer service.<br /><br />But on a more positive note, Supernatural is an amazingly well done show!  Good scripts, awesome cast, good direction.  I didn't come across this show until the 7th season, and I am trying to watch the other seasons so I can catch up.  The problem is that I can't watch one per week or even one per day.  I have to watch at least 3 in a row, so lots of chores aren't getting done at my house! It's addictive.  Sam and Dean are awesome! Castiel isn't to hard on the eyes either.  Great actors.
B006PAV1XO|5.0|nice movie<br />M L<br /><br />1)  In Trifles, how do the men's conversations and actions reveal their attitudes toward women?<br />The men feel they have more power over the women. They do not appreciate the women because they think that they have no idea how to solve a murder case. The think by looking at the silly little things in the house such as the quill, the bird cage, messy table rotten fruit and Mrs. Wright not having kids yet having such a messy house is out of the ordinary the men feel these details are not important because they do not lead into helping solve the murder when in reality they do.<br />2. What is the significance of the birdcage and the dead bird? What do they symbolize? Why do Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters respond so strongly to them? How do you respond?<br />The birdcage is evidence of a bird missing,. The empty bird cage leaves these women to wonder what had happened to the bird. When they find the dead bird they realize that Mrs. Wright had killed her husband and used the bird as a practice kill. They women react so strongly because they know how miserable Mrs. Wright was married and since they men would not notice this small “insignificant” evidence of the bird cage they hide the evidence to make sure Mrs. Wright was not arrested. I do not know how to respond<br />3. Characterize John Wright. Why did his wife kill him?<br />Mr. Wright was a boring average man who did not like to socialize. By what Mrs. Hales says that he did not want to put in a phone because “people talk to much anyways.” Mrs. Wright felt lonely not having anyone but her husband. Her cheerful spirit was slowly starting to be drained. His wife killed him because she felt suffocated. She had no one but her husband and her husband did not want her to socialize either. She felt trapped as if she had no choice but to kill him.<br />4. What is the significance of the play's last line, spoken by Mrs. Hale: &#34;We call it knot it, Mr. Henderson&#34;? Explain what you think the tone of Mrs. Hale's voice is when she says this line. What is she feeling? What are you feeling?<br />In the beginning of the play the two women were trying to figure out if Mrs. Wright was going to “quill or knot it” for the quilt. The men made fun of the women. In the end the men ask why they decided Mrs. Wright is going to do they say “knot it” because the women have solved the murder knowing that Mrs. Wright has killed her husband, but the men do not know. The line has a hidden meaning so I think the tone of Mrs. Hales is confident and empowering. She feels that she is smarter than the men by solving the mystery even though the men do not know. I feel that these women have every right to feel confident about themselves because these men do not view them equal.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Best game i have ever played. Haven't played pool in awhile, guess what you remember never goes away. I used to be pretty good, once played in a beginner's tournament but that was many many years ago.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|After reading the first two books in just a few short days, I waited patiently in anticipation of this third and final book. It felt a bit slow getting started and the changes between the perspectives of Tris and Tobias were a bit confusing because sometimes you couldn't tell which was speaking and they came off as speaking almost the same way- maybe this was intentional and the author wants us to see how simliarly they think?<br />Also, I just didn't like where she went with it, it fell short for me. Almost like she rushed this book and didn't think it through. It wasn't enough, it felt like the end should have been about something bigger. Especially if it meant killing Tris.<br />I had hoped to see more of a relationship develop between Tris and Tobias and also felt such an emotional attachment to them that I felt entitled to their happy ending. I shed a lot of tears over the course of  reading these books and this one let me down. Wish it would have gone differently!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I chose it because every one is gaga over the Candy Crush game and thought it would be the same but it isn't. Got bored with it and don't play it anymore.
B003477DVK|5.0|My daughter is a dog freak and absolutely loved this movie. Good clean family and a good message for the kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much, it's so well worded. I also like the way I could really relate to it me personally. It's a phenomenal book. Love you Susan Collins
B00338QENI|5.0|Very good as far as0 the family and science goes. A bit much as far as the family so concerned with th money.  If anyone should have been rich it should have been the doctor and his lab assistent who saved the cells so dilegently.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|For a free basic app, this alarm clock is awesome on a Kindle Fire. It also has the option to save battery power!  I just need a real alarm without it being complicated. This is it. I definitely recommend this app!
B0068OXAM2|5.0|I chose the book because I needed a refresher and that is exactly what the book offers. Glad I purchased it.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This is a terrific Enigma CD with high energy, high powered music. I highly recommend it for old and new fans alike!
B003VANOFY|5.0|My gaming boys (35, 15, and 8 years old) LOVE these! No more cords to trip over. Great sound, and no problems with them!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I avoided candy crush for a very long time, but it finally sucked me in.  I was disappointed to find out I couldn't pay on my kindle fire, but they finally added it to the app store!  This is a very addictive game!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|It really bums me out when you can't say hi or thank an actor. I just saw the notebook on Encore for the 1st time. I don't watch dramas but got hooked on this movie in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep. James Garner was Awsome! But Rachel changed my life with how she preformed in this movie. It was so real. I must have watched this movie 10 time now. Her expressions are priceless & when shes crying she is at her prettyist. She wrote that when she read the scrip she cryed all the way threw it. It has gripped my heart & made it heavy when I think about it. The whole gang in this movie did the best job possible. I treat my wife differant now. We are older now and it made me care & love her more. Thank you to all that worked on this movie.  Cheers
B004GYY714|5.0|I'm not a techie, so it took me a while to download it, but it works great once you get it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you're looking for a happy ending turn around and never look back. I was at least somewhat enjoying the book (it's not her  best) but.... not anymore. Sorry if you loved the ending (who would?) but it sucks and it totally ruined my life and the book. If Veronica was trying to get emotions from the readers, she got it, but it's not happy.<br /><br />Besides that, I feel like the story itself is a little boring. Sure it has action and all that, but it's a little repetitive. Let's change it up a little! It's another classic case. The first book is amazing, the writings great, the plot interesting, the characters dynamic. The second book is not as good, but it still is exciting and the writings still pretty awesome. Then the third book comes out, after so may stressful months waiting,  it's a little...disappointing. Veronica Roth is an ok author, but the story felt a little strained. I got confused a lot. After the huge build up in the other books, I suspected more action. I didn't expect for them to just waltz out the fence with a couple casualties and be invited rather kindly into the outside world. It was a let down and a little bit of a buzz kill. All of Roth 's future as largely successful author just went down the drain along with all of the characters happiness.<br /><br />The ending felt uncalled for and didn't add much to the overall story. People like happy endings. Might want to remember that Veronica. I wouldn't suggest this book. Don't waste your money, even if it's only 7 bucks. Go buy yourself some candy and spare yourself the disappointment. I'm not sure I can see the movie now that I know how it all ends..... *sigh* pass some memory serum, please. Or even better, how about some death serum hmm?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A terrific read! It's better than the shining. You won't want to put it down. Stephen king just keeps getting better!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I liked this series, mainly because of the cast and the storyline. This series is about Lawyers and various types of court cases. Most had a different result, from what may have been expected.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Excellent movie in all aspects.  From mystery, to suspense, to romance. I would recommend to anyone.  Plot twists and turns made my guess of the ending nearly impossible.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I read this book when I was very young. It is a story that stays with you forever. This newer edition was very interesting especially when read with eyes that are fifty years older and combined with a trip to the Ann Frank house in Amsterdam.
0156027321|3.0|The book is great until the end. It just doesn't make too much sense. Was the entire story apocryphal? Was the story true? It seems to have a definitive ending but it just wasn't clear.
B003XT603Q|5.0|Beautiful writing, as always. Fewer fantasy/dream sequences than many of his other novels.<br /><br />A great evocation of adolescence turning by fits and starts into adulthood.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|A must for anyone purchasing the Voyager Legend Headset.  Honestly, I don't know how I would effectively keep my headset charged or protected with out it. A MUST.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush! This game is addictive and challenging! I have nothing negative to say about it and would recommend this game to anyone.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've waited for a long time and tried all the tricks and now it's here. If you love match 3 games this will be your new addiction.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie and plot.  Keeps you entertained the whole time.  Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Its a knife sharpener pretty hard to mess it up. It works as advertised, it is a bit of a pain to hold on to, but for a small available quick way to sharpen your blade, this is the way to go.
0345803493|5.0|I loved it!Christian is man any woman would love! I really liked that it was based in Seattle since I'm from Olympia

B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I think it it is great place to meet people and to build friendships,possibly more. I give it a two thumbs up. Great job badoo. You guys are amazing.I've made some new friends. GREAT JOB BADOO
B004EF65QA|4.0|Very well acted and absorbing story including scenes in a textile mill which I found very interesting.  Having lived in a &#34;mill town&#34; in the American south, I could see a distinct correlation, including why workers were called &#34;lintheads&#34;.  Also, can't omit a good love story and action sequences.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Tried it, LOVED IT. Works perfect on kindle I have been playing for a week and its awesome! The dragons actually look like dragons, there's a colloseum, and the Dragon track. -NEGATIVE NOTE- this game is not big on society, so if you want jillions of friends, switch to dragon story<br />They love that c***.
B009MB682W|4.0|Great music for along trip and great music for the quit evening at home..I like the James Bond music and movies!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this book since first hearing about it and I was not disappointed!  The grown up Danny was a flawed human who finally overcame his horrific childhood trauma and Abra was a true delight.  In my opinion, Doctor Sleep ranks right up there with Stephen King's finest novels.  Two thumbs up and five stars from me!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a very good game. Can become addictive though. I love playing this game. The mAtching part of the game is the easiest part. Trying yo beat it by the number of moves is the hardest.
B004XUMPFQ|3.0|I started watching &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; earlier this year.  Surely, I waited way too long to watch it; it is very funny, perhaps the best sitcom on television.  I've been trying to catch up on all six or seven seasons as quickly as possible, and I'm getting close.<br /><br />I was watching an episode last night, where Leonard -- Johnny Galecki -- won a trip to visit the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, and Sheldon -- Jim Parsons -- automatically assumed that Leonard would take Sheldon as a guest.  Instead, Leonard decided to take Penny -- Kaley Cuoco -- and can you blame him?  Especially since it was on Valentine's Day.  I'm sure that Leonard had a lot of colliding on his mind. . . ..<br /><br />Anyways, Sheldon gets mad at Leonard, calling him a &#34;traitor&#34; or something, and a traitor so severe that he was nearly as bad as Rupert Murdoch.  When Leonard looked puzzled by the reference -- everyone is always puzzled by Sheldon's references -- Sheldon said that Mr. Murdoch was a traitor because &#34;he owns Fox and he cancelled Firefly.&#34;  I had heard of Firefly but had never seen it.  Until today, but only by recommendations by Sheldon.<br /><br />After watching the pilot, I'm puzzled by Sheldon's remarks as well.  &#34;Why did he like this series?&#34; is my immediate thinking.  Oh it has the standard &#34;diverse cast&#34; that everyone loves, and it's got some not-quite-lame special effects.  But the dialog is iffy, at best.  At the beginning, some commander dude says something like, &#34;We've just done the impossible.  And that makes us special.&#34;  Now, even Sheldon would have trouble with this logic, because if you've done something, it can't be impossible, unless of course you're in an alternate universe where the rules of Physics are different.  &#34;Well, they didn't do anything impossible then, and therefore they may not be special,&#34; would be my response.<br /><br />At another point, something bad happens and someone else says,&#34;Good God in Heaven.&#34;  I agree with that.  &#34;Good God in Heaven, why did they ever create this series?&#34; would be my question, not &#34;Good God why did Mr. Murdoch ever cancel the series?&#34;<br /><br />My apologies to Sheldon.  Kinda.  And leave Rupert Murdoch -- and Leonard -- alone.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I tried it and I really don't like it. If you are getting this app I suggest you get it on ios cause I did some research and it turns out on ios has some better things to offer. Anyway, I just think the dragons look derpy and all. :P
B0083Z614S|5.0|Amazing, the story wouldn't let me put my kindle down... i was amazing from the twists and the story itself
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Well acted ,very entertaining and unpredictable ending. I would recommend most everyone. It had story about relationships today. My family enjoyed it very much.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Pretty good thus far. Awesome game play and graphics. Local connections get a bit sketchy and there are a few glitches with the missions but I could play this for a long time without getting bored.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|The film was well done in most respects. The chemistry between McConaughey and Foster was unconvincing, perhaps, but they turned in respectable individual performances. I'd say Sagan succeeded in helping us see SETI from a more practical perspective while entertaining us at the same time. One of the practical considerations, of course, is that by the sheer weight of the numbers, if Darwinian evolution occurs spontaneously whenever and wherever conditions are right, there should be literally millions of worlds in the observable universe where it has (and/or is) happening, with many civilizations far more advanced than ours (per the somewhat controversial work of astronomer Frank Drake and others). So where are these beings and why don't they respond to our hails? These are all intriguing questions that Sagan helps us consider in this imaginative screenplay.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|**Spoilers**<br /><br />Allegiant is proving to be quite the controversy, though perhaps not for the reasons it should. The series was never going to be fine literature, though I was definitely entertained and devoured the first two books; they were escapist and overall a good read. After reading Insurgent I found out that Veronica Roth is quite vocal about her Christian background, which set up certain expectations for the climax of the final book (in more ways that one, you might say). However, I didn't find her tone at all preachy or heavy-handed in the first two novels - that changes a bit here. This final book has definite changed how I'm going to view the movies as they come out, and will make it hard to read the first two books again.<br /><br />I had absolutely no ideas about what might happen in Allegiant, so I was excited to find out how the series would conclude. However, I think there were missteps - some apparent right from the beginning. From a narrative standpoint, my biggest qualm was the shift in perspective; while I didn't mind seeing things through Four's eyes, he is not the person who led me into this world, and is not the most reliable or interesting narrator. There was also hardly any narrative between Tris and Four - often I read a few pages into a chapter before realizing I was picturing the wrong person. Switching back and forth every other chapter is a bit hacky - check out how George RR Martin does it to get an idea of how multiple perspective is used skillfully. I see now why Roth decided to do this, but I think she could have cut of Tris's voice and ended with Four's and we still would have had the same journey.<br /><br />The actual storyline also frustrated me a bit; I was rather disappointed to find out what was outside the city because it took some of the magic away. Everything slows around the middle of the book, and I found myself wondering how it could possibly be wrapped up in a cohesive way (which, in truth, it doesn't quite do). Most of the book is far away from the world that was created in the first two books, which is a risky choice. I definitely saw more of Roth's religious background in this book as well (quite obviously in Tris' questioning of God and the destruction of her reality).<br /><br />Which leads me to the end - the focal point for 99% of the reviews up so far. From a purely literary standpoint, I don't have a problem with the main character dying. We readers are so used to happy endings that we forget how often a narrative can't logically conclude with the heroine dancing into the sunset, but I really don't think this is why Tris died. I thin Roth made a calculated choice that was consistent with her views, but not with the text, or rather, what we all bought into in the text. Tris' death was very symbolic (the Christ imagery is a little overdone here) but unsatisfying. I kept expecting her to pop out in the last few chapters - a sign that the death was not fully resolved. Make no mistake, the heart of the series went with Tris, which is why so many people are finding it hard to take, I think.<br /><br />You definitely need to suspend reality to believe the ending has any sort of permanence, that Tris died to save something real - lose that and the ending stings that much more. I don't think the book deserves a 1 star rating, but I, for one, can't get fully behind a series that ends on a bum note. In Game of Thrones, it's tragic when a character meets their grisly end, but there are other full-formed characters who can carry the book. The biggest problem here is that Four is not fully-developed; we see him from Tris' eyes, and when we lose that it all feels a little hollow.  I also just didn't expect the book to take the turn it did when it pulled the rug out from the first two books, and I'm not sure I liked it - we've seen the genetics allegory before, and done better.<br /><br />To sum up: There isn't enough narrative weight in Allegiant to support the bold moves thatRoth makes. The storyline is a bit lacking compared to the first two novels, and at the end of the day, the ideas expressed here feel out of place - these readers (myself included) just wanted to happy ending! But hey, it didn't offend me and it got me thinking, so maybe that alone makes it a little successful.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After reading the other two books, I thought the last book would be worth reading to see how it all ended. I was highly disappointed. The ending was not worth the money or my time. I think all the books had potential but the author fell short with the story line. Read at your own risk but trust me it not worth it.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This movie focuses on McClain's son, Jack and his involvement with the CIA. Good action, somewhat predictable and of course lots of things get blown up, chases and special effects. Not nearly as much fun as &#34;Live free or Die Hard&#34;. Still, not a bad way to pass an evening with the family.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the Bible! What's not to love about it.  The Bible is super easy to read.  I absolutely love it.  Especially the fact that I can carry it with me everyday!

B002K0WBXW|5.0|My wife goes into convulsions every time she watches this one. I, too, think there are some funny scenes and very good comedy acting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like playing the game, but it freezes up on my cell phone and I couldn't seem to find it on kindle.  But finally it's available on kindle and I plan to enjoy playing it. Thanks!
B005OYKI1I|3.0|Entertaining and solid performances. There are some good action scenes, a great chase scene with a large safe involved and a nice closing at the end. A little harsh for young families, and grandma, (unless she is Ma Barker type), probably will not like it. The men will either say it is OK or great. I can't see the girlfriend or wife loving this, but Vin Diesel gives a good solid performance and is easy on the eyes.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really love this game, it is awesome! I think that you should purchase Plauge Inc. because you will like it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was an amazing read! I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day!
B00723NWJE|3.0|She still hasn't topped the first album. I like Norah in some of her other styles. She is versatile and in demand. I just like the smokey jazz style.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Really fun and interesting. It definitely was hours of fun and lots of fun puzzles.<br />It was really fun and great to play. Definitely worth the money.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Well done movie. Usually the second, third, fourth movies in a series loses some of the magic, or in some cases a lot, but this held my attention. Good story line and fun to watch.

B004G6009K|5.0|Frying Pans.... Who Knew.  Our kids would get the frying pans out every time they watched this movie.  I can't tell you how many times we have seen this.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the 3d portion as we don't have a 3d tv.

B008J34466|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to this CD in the car nearly everyday since I bought it!  My daughter & I sing together.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Good action entertainment. I absolutely adore the new casting and the way the new stories are being developed. Each of the characters are being well developed, consistent with the performances of the past movies and shows. This movie plays well with the re-write of &#34;The Wrath of Khan and some of the moments from The Search for Spock&#34;. All in all, good clean fun, lots of action, the actors are enjoyable in their roles, and the sets are awesome.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I value quality. I had researched different headsets long and hard before making this choice: unfortunately, it was a bad one.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong: The Headset unit itself is very nice, a comfortable, reasonably-well-sounding set of cans built around a sturdy aircraft-grade aluminum core (A nice upgrade from the wired model, by the way). While it worked, it worked beautifully.<br /><br />My issue arises with the receiver unit. Why on earth would a designer create a wonderful headset and then skimp on the receiver? The USB stick is held on to the USB head only by the soldered pin connections! Not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES, the head of the USB receiver just popped out of the plastic casing.<br /><br />Of course, after spending money three times in a row fixing what I assumed was a freak accident, I got a little frustrated. I ended up sending the broken receiver to Logitech with a letter explaining my woes. This letter was sent at the end of August, just over a year after my initial purchase, and less than six months after my last replacement purchase. No response yet, electronically, via phone, or via email.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in Logitech. I own both the Logitech Attack Joystick, as well as the G330s, which have performed quite well. Be warned that customer loyalty and persistence (I sent them an email and a PHYSICAL LETTER, for goodness' sake!) are ignored by this company!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and series. I thought it was very well written and a great storyline. One of my favorite series!!!
1572816112|4.0|I love the art on these cards. It is amazing and I could just go through looking at it. I do wish that the book it came with was a litte more detailed though.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I lost the icon on the computer screen about a week after I got it. I can't figure out how to get it back.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|This is a decent movie, enjoyable and depending on your mood, fun to watch. The story line is a bit used, action scenes are good, but nothing outstanding. Enjoyable entertainment for the family.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Then you can't go wrong here. I love Follett and this book delivers. Looking forward to book three in the trilogy.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|A definite purchase for all Sherlock Holmes fans.  I like having it on my Kindle to read when I want.  Good short stories.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Not bad for a free game.  Like the one that I paid for better but it gives me more variety of games
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie, will keep you on the edge of your seat guessing the next move of the main characters. Each actor gave great performances and the characters they portrayed where fun to watch. Great cast, great movie, fun for the family and if you are a magician buff and love tricks and illusions, this is the one for you.
B000I9U8VO|5.0|Patrick Stewart, et. al do it again. Great entertainment, and action packed adventure. Creativity at its best. How can they top it!
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I'm so sorry to have to report that this may be my least favorite Dream Theater album ever.  I have every single one including When Dream and Day Unite, and that one had lots of forgettable music on it, sorry guys, but this new self-titled album has so much wrong with it I wonder what the band was truly aiming for.<br /><br />First off, the recording quality is dismal.  We were told repeatedly that Mangini did such crazy, amazing drumming on this album and even the band was blown away by how insane it was.  Terrific!  I can't wait!  Oh, I'm listening to 80% guitars/keyboards and 20% bass and drums.  They smashed this &#34;crazy/insane/amazing&#34; drumming so far down in the mix and muddied it so badly I can barely hear what the hell is going on.  Mike Mangini himself said that he used &#34;a bunch of triggers&#34; i.e., foot pedals and small trigger pads all around his already sizable drum kit to pull off these crazy, impossible fills that can't be done without them.  He goes on about how he used foot triggers to play cymbals while he did some ridiculous fill that otherwise wouldn't be able to played without them!  Wow, Mike, did you hear the final mix?  I can't hear ANY of this stuff you say you played.  Your drums sound like the engineer hated you and stuck a single mic in the NEXT ROOM and told you to go ahead and play.  The snare sounds like bucket you got at Home depot.  The bass drums sound a wet blanket hitting the wall.  All of the toms sound like you stole them from Phil Collins from the 80's.  The truth of the matter is your amazing technical prowess has been squashed under a layer of other instruments so completely you might as well have sat recording out and let Cakewalk Pro Audio do your job.  Now, the entire album is not like this, just about 99% of it.  I don't know who convinced you that from the Dramatic Turn of Events album to this self-titled album that you should make your snare go from that very cool crisp snap that you had to this awful thud,but you've been had, and again, your inspiring perfection has been lost in a sea of overtones and muddy sound.<br /><br />There was this really cool part near the end minute or so of Enigma Machine where you played a pretty neat solo fill and I could hear some absolutely astounding things, and then the rest of the band came in and smooshed it all in a small box and you were back to being stepped on by guitars and keyboards.<br /><br />Lemme harp on Mr. Myung for a minute, too.  You are a fantastic player.  You approach the intrument much in the same way I've approached instruments.  Practice, practice, practice is what makes us truly good players.  We work very hard at what we do.  You are at the very top of your game and I still don't understand why you are mixed so far down in the music as to be nearly non-existant.  You're almost like a prog-bass version of Michael Anthony at this point, except the keys AND guitars are drowning you out.  Your playing is amazing and I CAN'T HEAR YOU!  Maybe it's the engineers, maybe it's the Bongo Bass?  I dunno.  I'm not saying go get a Rickenbaker or anything but maybe you could try one and see what kinda difference it makes?  Or, better yet, get that mothballed Chapman Stick back out and beat that sucker up like on New Millenium.  I could hear you back then and it was awesome!<br /><br />I'm not going to bother reviewing individual songs, but I'll say that the high point of the album is clearly Illumination Theory.  This single (albeit long) song has all the energy and excitement I've come to love about Dream Theater.  It's sadly, however, the only song, after sitting through the entire rest of the album, to give me those &#34;electric chills&#34; you sometimes get when hearing certain musical refrains.  I listened intently for that spark through every song and very early in Illumination Theory I got supercharged because it was just that good.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album left me feeling like I was hearing a cheap copyof Dream Theater and most of what they were playing was almost a parody of itself.<br /><br />I guess it's going to be at least another year and a half or two years before the next Dream Theater album comes out and I'm very sorry to say that gone are the days of high energy and outright exultation from the amazing album that was Systematic Chaos.  Dream Theater was one of the few bands were every new album (unintentionally) sought to leave the previous album in the dust and Systematic Chaos, to me, seemed to be the pinacle of this near constant upward trend.  Other bands after three or four albums hit their high and never seemed to get back to that same level due to personnel changes or mainstream influence; Yes and Rush are two pretty good examples.  They still write music and release albums but there's something about those older albums that keeps us going back.  Dream Theater bucks that trend and I enjoy Train of Thought or Octavarium just as much as Images and Words, but the trend tripped badly with Black Clouds and Silver Linings.  Count of Tuscany was a wonderful song but the rest falls by the wayside.  There's about 45 seconds of truly awesome music in Dramatic Turn in the second verse of Lost Not Forgotten but the rest is just a pointless storm of notes.<br /><br />If you're a huge fan, you'll get this anyway.  If you need to determine if you're a fan and are trying to figure out if the self-titled album is right for you, I almost hate to have to say to pass on this one.  Stick with anything starting at Images and Words and stop when you hit Systematic Chaos and never go forward from there.  I think Dream Theater is on a slippery slope they may not recover from and it truly hurts my heart to have to say it.
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Cute, clever, funny. Reese is endearing and clever. The movie is light hearted and silly. Great for a good laugh all around.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is a normal John Grisham novel.  It mad me laugh in places.  I truely love all books by John Grisham
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fun quick read. Highly recommend. Great read if you enjoyed the first book or the movie. Enjoy the storyline. Suzanne Collins has a winning formula.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|I miss this show.  It was one of the few remaining highlights of  SyFy's lineup.  It ended too soon but also dragged on some portions of character development.
B005HGKWLO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It took me back to the days of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks lighting up the screen.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Your goal in the game is to aim your tennis balls at certain targets (characters) bouncing off walls, through obsticles, and in to the targets in the fewest balls possible. It's a lot like the goal of Angry Birds or Fragger (or even Worms but you don't get to move or change your weapons; I added this to show that the gameplay is tried and true for years and nothing very new). The biggest difference is that you are inexplicably a tennis player and your birds, grenades or bullets are tennis balls.<br /><br />The game plays quick and easy and works very well on a variety of my devices. It is easy enough to get through but challenging to complete levels at the highest levels. The sound is good. Controls are clean. No problematic permissions.<br /><br />All that to say: the game is clean, well made, fun but not very original. I think that's the definition of average.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|One of the first escape games I played.  Used someone elses kindle to play need to buy my own so I could play when ever I wanted to.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I loved the graphics.  The puzzles were a challange. The whole concept kept me going and I hid under the covers to win.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I love Atwood's light-hearted yet extremely dark take on our possible near-future. She seems to write so joyfully about so much of the terrible of the world that when she drops the sad on you it hits like a crumbling skyscraper. Loved this series, and recommend it to anyone curious/worried/fascinated about the fate of the human race.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read! I had a great time going back to Danny Torrance's nightmares as a kid with his Shining abilities. The story unfolds when he follows Jack Torrance's footsteps as an alcoholic. With the bottle not being tipped over Danny's shining has given him a chance to encounter another child with the same abilities as him. This time instead of the Overlook, something more sinister is after this child. Doctor Sleep is the story of one man's shining is another's assistance to battle those that want to get steam to continue nightmares for all of those who have The Shining! Doctor Sleep is Danny Torrance and his ability to help others is a story filled with terror and dreams that reach a highly anticipated climax that is a must read for fans of The Shining or fans of the great horror writer that is Stephen King!
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Like [[ASIN:B007KQ6XYY Cut the Rope: Experiments]] expanded the game play of the original [[ASIN:B0058VW36U Cut the Rope]] or [[ASIN:B00FR84CB8 Where's My Water? 2]] adds gameplay elements to the original [[ASIN:B006D1ONE4 Where's My Water?]] without messing too much with the outstanding gameplay, Sprinkle Islands adds to the [[ASIN:B00846WWVM Sprinkle]] game without ruining the excellent strategy gameplay.<br /><br />You still spray water to put out fires, but now you do so in a different setting with the added goal of moving through each island to the next which requires creating paths. While the game is easy to understand and play it remain challenging to complete levels fully.<br /><br />This developer has a history of making incredible games and this is no different. It runs great, looks great, and doesn't snoop on our private data. Very nice!<br /><br />Also, thank you Amazon for a great FAOTD!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Again this is a childs novel by John Grisham but I still enjoyed reading it.  I thought that they were a series but you don't need to read any of the others to still foolow this book.  There are mention of thing that happened int he other book.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|One doesn't hear much about China during this period of history. My eyes continue to be opened about Japan's role in history.  Historically interesting and speaks to a parent's love for their child.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I enjoyed the Avengers but didn't understand all the underlying character issues.  I decided to watch all the individual movies.  Thor was very good and I look forward to Thor 2.

0007466064|5.0|Great read. Can hardly wait for the one the author is writing now. The characters are complex and intriguing. Wonderful
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This is a good book.  It is a kids novel but I still enjoyed it since it was a John Grisham novel
B008EL25LE|3.0|The game is ok..but the story pages are slow .  It does have nice graphics.  It is a challenge to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy they put back on the kindle. I didn't know it was as addictive as everyone says but it is love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put the book down once I started it.  Many interesting twists and turns, compasion and forgiveness through out the book.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really truly enjoyed this book. I didn't want to put it down and read it in three days. It had some good twists and the ending was different that you'd expect in a lot of YA books but worth reading for sure!
B005USZML4|5.0|Simple fast reading but it you enjoy John Grisham as an authore you will enjoy this book.  It is a child novel
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome its like you r really watching the movie but it would've been cool if it was like 3D
006202406X|1.0|I've never been so disappointed with the conclusion to a series of books.  I really enjoyed the first two books.  This one was an effort to get through with an extremely disappointing finish.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app just the right amount of fun with a good challenge as well. Koodos to the designers and programmers of this game
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I saw this book when I visited my son who is a correctional officer. He has seen the results of these types of exercises in the prison population. It is effective.<br /><br />The book seems well laid out. Wade gives the history of calisthenics and several examples. I like the multiple steps to get to your goal. It's a good book to read through one time and then go back and decide how you want to start the program. There are tips though out the book that you might miss by skimming through it.<br /><br />Remember, it's not about how soon you progress to the next level. It's about when you need to move to the next level. If you're making progress at the current level stay there instead of burning out like many of my friends did when they tried P90x and other thrash and trash programs.<br /><br />I've only been doing the exercises for a month but already I am seeing improvements and without being sore all the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Addicted! My favorite thing to do; my favorite past time! Finally, it made it to Amazon! I can't stop playing!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Yeah, It was a little fantasy like but I still enjoyed it. I would watch it again for sure. Everyone should see it at least once.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This. game works. for me because it's quiet and doesn't require fast responses.  It's athinking game.  I especially like that I can repeat a game to get the best score. I learn faster that way.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Still havent beat it!  I have completed all the other ones and I love these games.  Everyone in my shop loves to give it a go, and one day it will be beat!  Buy it if you love challenging games!
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|I liked it because it was a little different from the others. I liked the acting and storyline, and the way it ended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very additive fun game.  Be aware it will test your patience but you'll love it.  Have it on my phone, laptop and my kindle.  What's that tell ya!!  Love it!!!
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This has got to be one of the scariest movies we have seen in years!  If you have yet to watch it- you're definitely missing out.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Took me a week to read but it was very much worth my Time I learned over 5000000000 more we odds in my head
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally I'm able to play Candy Crush on my Kindle. my husband objects .because now I'm on my Kindle more.  I can play on the go.
B009ZQFSRA|1.0|What this movie lacks in acting and on screen chemistry is made up in the artistic filming. Some great camera shots, but that's it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game..the only thing is you have to have a lot of acorns to purchase most of the animals.
0802473156|5.0|Great book - helps us understand our partners and where they are at and how best to communicate with them to make a marriage/relationship successful.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Well this is the best game of my life. But it costs too many gru coins to revive the minion
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Kids like it, not too scary, still funny.  The beginning drags on a bit but otherwise it's a fun family movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Does what it says it will better than anything else. What can I say. It the freekin' weather channel for goodness sakes.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This one was a book that captured your imagination right up front and it didn't let go. Easy to read with a plot that doesn't hurt your brain when you try to keep up with it. Take a moment in fact take two and you'll be glad you did.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|After watching the first season, couldn't wait until the second season came out. Pefect condition - brand new.  Thanks you.
006202406X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all of the books in the Divergent series because the structure is unlike any I have ever read. Allegiant is not different and I thoroughly enjoyed the surprises that awaited me while reading this. If you are a fan of dystopian or fall-of-civilization based novels, this is an excellent series to read. This book did take away some of the surrealism of the series for me, but it did so in a way that left me satisfied rather than make me feel like the story lost meaning.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Another great game that is chalked full of money hungry restrictions. Exactly why console gaming lives on. Ratchet as hell
B004EPYZSU|5.0|We loved it in the theatre...now we get to watch it again at home.  A quirky tale about aliens during the time of the cowboys, full of action, great special effects, and actor Daniel Craig.
1567184855|5.0|A REALLY good read about what really may just be the truth about that great journey one takes after drawing their last breath!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Awesome!!!!! Wouldn't miss this show for any reason. Been waiting for the new season to start for months, really excited to see what happens this season.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|like the game but can't figure why we have to pause if we don't past the level...guess they think you will pay $.99
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|Good thing this was the free app of the day or I would have been pretty tucked off if I had paid for it. Not worry the .99 vents they are asking. Any free notebook app would do the same or better.
B00E65M5JY|3.0|I had more expectations for this DVD, since it is a production of James Cameron. I found that the subject matter is somewhat forced to fit the characters and ambience too dark the whole movie.
B00DGGIXS6|2.0|The truth is that this is maybe one of her poorest releases...all the first few songs sound alike with no meaning other than a steady beat of boredom...the few slow songs on the CD are decent, but nothing great.  I have always loved Cher and have many of her CD's that I've enjoyed over the years, saw her in person as well (fantastic) but.....somebody steered her wrong on this CD for sure.  After playing it three times, I still can't find a good song on it.
1451673442|5.0|An excellent book and easy to practice the recommendations contained within.<br />I am changing as I practice gratitude. I recommend it.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This book was in good condition, arrived quickly and is a staple in our extensive library.  Thank you for the &#34;Look Inside&#34; feature.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Do you listen to Jazz music?<br /><br />If you answered yes, download this app and enjoy.<br /><br /> The app is getting better all the time but the main functionality of listening to Jazz is the best part. If you become a member you can even get higher quality audio. This is great if you have a hi-fi stereo or nice headphones.<br /><br />Jazzradio.com, thank you for adding a sleep timer. This has really helped not waste your bandwidth.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Michael
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This was one of the better remakes of a horror movie I've seen. The story is basically the same, but updated. The effects are better and the scares are better. If you saw the first, just keep an open mind when watching this. Fanboys of the original will find numerous ways to put this movie down, but it's actually quite good. Definitely worth a watch.
0439023521|5.0|Wife enjoyed every bit of this ood.  It was a real page turner for her !<br />She had a very difficult time putting it down !
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Beautiful and inspiring!  I couldn't stop reading this story. A must read for everyone!  You will really enjoy this one.
B00ADR2DTG|4.0|I bought this 6 or so months ago to act as a preamp for one of my many hifi setups. It worked well for that, better than my other preamps.<br /><br />However, I moved, and when I moved I couldn't use speakers at my computer anymore. I plugged in my Sony MDR-V6 headphones and haven't looked back. I replaced the tube eventually with a Hammond 12AU7a that I took out of an organ speaker, which only improved it. Sounds great for almost everything I listen to. Also, with the top taken off, it looks like a high tech Taj Mahal.<br /><br />Cons- It is very susceptible to outside noise. Often, a cellphone will receive a text or call and I'll hear all sorts of chirps.<br /><br />When listening to trombone or choir music, it distorts like crazy. Something about the purity and overtones present in voice and trombone makes the tube or outputs go nuts. It makes me sad not being able to listen to those genres (I'm a trombonist). I usually resort to my Zune HD for that stuff.
B00EODUWQ6|5.0|It seems almost shameful to submit an online review for this book!<br />What a read. It makes me happy I still remotely have the privilege of privacy.
B00AEBB9V4|5.0|If you like classic Halloween tales like I do, you'll love this movie. Even though you can watch it any part of the year, it feels more like a Halloween movie. The acting is great. Johnny Depp fans will enjoy his performance. Christina Ricci is equally good. You've heard the story of the headless horseman. Now you can watch it the way it was meant to be.
006202406X|5.0|**Spoilers**I finished Alligent around 10 last night and basically stared in silence for a couple of hours.  I've battled the gamut of grief throughout the night and woke up with new perspective.<br /><br />All in all I think I'm landing on \\"hauntingly beautiful\\" as my best description.  Sure, everyone loves a \\"happy ending\\" and yes...many (myself included) read these types of books for escape and balk at the authors who do not give us the alternate realities we desire.  But rarely, when we reflect deeply enough we are able to also find threads of redemption and cathartic meaning in works of fiction that enage and surprise us.  This final installment did just that.<br /><br />While I could reflect on the circular revelations of each key character, my thoughts primarily land on Tris and Tobias.<br /><br />From the first chapter of Divergent on we see Tris as someone who lives with this deep pitted hole for the lack of selflessness she feels.  While she has countless opportunities throughout the series to display sacrifice, it's never really evident to her (though obvious to those around her) that her actions are truly unselfish and brave.  It's not until her final act when she truly wants to live, has something to live for, yet gives her life in exchange for others, that she is able to yield to her personal measure of selflessness and release herself.  My hope that is in death she finally made peace with this...and I think she does with her final statement, \\"I believe it.\\"<br /><br />As for Tobias, his final words and thoughts were gut wrenching passages to digest...(esp. the scene with Christina re: the memory serum).  When his character is introduced and progresses, we see a picture of someone desperately broken.  He was damaged not by his genes, but by the wounds inflicted by those closest to him that chose to hurt and abandon him.  Ultimately and (ironically) he only finds healing (mending) through hurt and loss.  Note that Tris' parting message to him was not \\"Ilove you,\\" but \\"I didn't WANT to leave you\\".  There is power in that...yes, loss, but also redemptive power.<br /><br />Last year, I lost a friend to a tragic accident.  Over the course of time I have watched her sweet husband grieve her absence.  His honest pain, anger, and yes...his ability to remember her and the impact she had on his life and the lives of others has created healing.  The pain is still there, but there is untold strength in the mending.  Nothing any of us would have chosen, but an immeasurable picture of true, gritty..bravery.  There is so much power in Tobias' final words in the last chapter re: step by step, choosing to put one foot in front of the other and live life kind of bravery.  Some times we get to choose our path and sometimes it chooses us.  What we do with it is where we discover our truest identity and meaning.<br /><br />I for one am thanking Veronica Roth for this bittersweet, redemptive end to a series and characters who captured my heart.
B00FVS3RZQ|3.0|Hopefully the writers get out of whatever funk they are in and start doing something more interesting with the show.<br /><br />After how many years of surviving and they are still getting killed in dumb ways and acting whiny all the time?<br />Hey I'm not going to carry my gun anymore, because weapons kill and I don't want to be a killer.<br />Hey let's leave every door open so we can get eaten in our sleep and be completely disarmed so we can't fight back, even though we somehow were smart enough to survive for several years.<br />I'm a freaking solo wandering, wasteland samurai sword zombie killing machine, but I trip and fall down like a helpless girl at an inane plot point so the kid has a reason to pick up the rifle once again and be worried that his dad will get mad.<br />Hey I'm the whiniest/most useless person in the group last couple of seasons and now I'm the whiniest person teaching whiny children to use knives because someone has to, even though I'm completely ineffective at using said knives.<br />Even though I've had everyone I've known and cared about killed right in front of me multiple times, and killed hundreds if not thousands of zombies, I'm going to collapse with grief every time someone even remotely close to me bites it.<br /><br />Man up and fight, people, you've had 3 seasons to kill off all the useless dregs, there shouldn't be any left.<br /><br />I'm to the point that I'm going to start rooting for the zombies.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you enjoy sci-fi in general, Star Trek specifically, or if you think both are kind of silly, this book is for you!
B00C6BACF4|5.0|You don't have to love zombie movies to like this one. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver their best performance, in my opinion. A mixture of comedy and a few scares. I've always been a fan of their movies and this one is definitely my favorite. The steelbook has great art. And when you add in the fact that it includes the Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and UltraViolet copy, you can't go wrong.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|You should only by from LifeProof, others are knockoffs and do not work as well. I tested my cellphone under water and use mine in water all the time without issues. Very durable when dropped as well. Worth the buy. Note it will not work if you put the case on wrong and do not follow instructions!!
B004MC0FO8|4.0|It did not recognize ALL songs, but mostly gave picture of album, group and lyrics. Easy to operate on cell phone.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|Yes there are other apps out there that do the same thing and some in a fancier way.  This one is straight forward and easy to use.  The only draw back is that you can only enter things serially.  You can go back and add to a line your have already entered but you can not skip down a few lines and make an entry.  This would be a good thing because most stores are laid out in a certain order and we tend to buy in that order and make our list by the sections we encounter first and so on.
B001TH16DI|4.0|For someone who grew up before we flew into space, the stories of Star Trek fueled my imagination and fanned the flames of wanderlust and the desire to travel into the universe.  Sci-Fi was one of my favorite genres in book form and I even remember when voyager was launched into space.  So to see my dreams come alive on TV and the silver screen was a joy then as it is now.  Live long and prosper!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I know it's a show for teenagers, but I just love it! I will rent every episode they make !
B005CVWWJY|5.0|If you're a geek and especially if you have been one already in the 80s, this is the book for you. Movies, comics and, of course, computer games from that era build the background of this entertaining novel. I enjoyed it each time I read it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't want to start this game but when I did I loved it! It's soooo addicting lol and frustrating too but overall it's fun and keeps you busy!
B007712XAU|5.0|I love this program and was happy to be able to catch up on some episodes I had missed. Looking forward to future episodes.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|The film began with a quirky young man who lives his life accepting whatever life brings then brings it to a higher level.  When I first began watching my thoughts were what is this crazy guy doing?  As the film commenced my understanding grew deeper and deeper and when it ended I just loved this guy and I have to say that for the first time in a long time I truly admired the work of the artist that put it all together.  You must see, don't want to give away the film.  Beautifully filmed and subtitled.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|When I first started to read this, I wasn't impressed. The two points of view seemed like the worst decision any author could ever make. The writing style was different and awkward. It seemed like Veronica Roth was just trying to come up with an ending that hadn't been thought through.<br /><br />As I got further into the book, I still thought that the storyline was out of left field, but the two points of view was obviously the best, and only, choice for Allegiant. Seeing the story from Tris' point of view has been the entire series, but adding in Four's point of view not only helped to see various things at once, but it also helped to understand him and the relationship that they had.<br /><br />Though by the end I still felt like there were things missing from the story, I understand the writing choices that were made for this story completely. (Not saying I'm happy with them...) As a fan of this series from Day 1, the ending made me angry because I was attached to those relationships and seeing an ending there was a hit in the gut. But I will say that I understand the reasoning. I understand the meaning and the big picture. We don't always get to have a happily ever after anyway so why should we always expect the characters in our stories to have them?
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It took me a minute to decide how many stars I wanted to give this book. Because it is my second favorite out of the trilogy, I went with four stars. While it is poorly written, I do love the story that E.L. James is telling.<br />At times I felt like I was reading something a 9th grader wrote! James is very repetitive throughout the book. And You need a thesaurus in order to keep up! All these huge words to say the simplest of things! It really blew my reading experience! And for crying out loud, could you change up their dialogue during the gazillion sex scenes?! &#34;Please&#34; or &#34;Oh Ana!&#34; gets annoying to read every other two pages! And CLEARLY no one bothered to tell James that Americans do not speak the way that these characters do! It would have been easier to believe that they were British. I also noted a couple of typos. Where the hell was the editor? I rolled my eyes on many occasions! No fear of being severely punished! Haha.<br />However, with all the books flaws, I did find it absolutely captivating. I was able to look over everything I hated because I was sucked into Christian and Anastasia's dysfunctional yet somehow functional world. I needed to know what was going to happen next, and I stayed up a couple of late nights until I knew! All three of the books suck you in the same way and its hard to put them down. I fell in love with these characters and I find my &#34;inner goddess&#34; hoping that James will get a better editor and write a trilogy from Christian's point of view. But James, honey, for the love of your fans sanity! Pull back on the big words, stop being so repetitive and PUH-LEASE have these AMERICAN characters speak like AMERICANS! And how the hell do you &#34;clamber?&#34;<br />Gotta go! Laters! :)
B0091V6TF4|3.0|I was really surprised when I received this double CD set of the James Bond theme songs.  Apparently (according to the other reviews) I'm not the only one.  The CD containing all the theme songs is excellent.  The second CD is a complete and total waste of time.  It's a bunch of extraneous music plucked from the various movies...as if we really care (or would remember) these obscure musical pieces.  I think the product description is a bit deceiving.
B000QGEB12|5.0|I love this movie!!! Stephen Chow is a mastermind of kung fu comedy! The Axe Gang got their boogie on!!!
B00999DFP0|5.0|I searched a lot of sites and stores for the best price--and Amazon was hands-down the best value. And it arrived days sooner than expected, in perfect condition.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I do not know how I missed this one when it came out.  I graduated High School in 1983.  I think this came out the following year.  Guess I was too pre-occupied with Van Halen II.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is the best game I have played in years it is fun I will give you 5 stars at rating.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Nicely written even though I always hope for a happy ending..this ending was realistic and still interesting.  A good read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I GUESS I DIDN'T Do something right.  I'll keep trying,<br />I HAVE to admit that I'm not very good with these new fangled things.

B00EMGUR60|5.0|this is the best album of the year awesome sound is epic.lemmy proves hes still the master even in his 60s. too bad john lee hooker is no longer with us he would have made an excellent cover of woman gone blues.
0140049975|2.0|Cover torn ,,Sold Good Not Happy Book Sold in Good Condition.. Received book cover torn not in great shape. Book should be replaced or refunded..
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So many others have written a synopsis of the story, and I just want to describe my take on the theme.  Leisel said she could never tell a fable from a fairy tale which I think was Zusak's  intent - to use a story to teach us a lesson about the power of words.  On page 521 he describes how whole nations can commit atrocities because the leader is a master of words.  Death as well finds humans the most confusing yet endearing creatures because of their power to communicate.  Being able to influence others and be influenced is a great burden and responsibility for humans.  The power of right or wrong lies in the individual - even if are just a child.<br />.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is awesome especially since everyone loves it, both young and old<br />I recommend this game to any and every body
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Well done, great CGI and I grew up with the original.  I totally loved the car chase and I thought it was a sound story line.  No long winded answer, just a great and fun movie to watch.  I recommend a drink in one hand and a stogie in the other. (Arnold Style) :D
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive!!!  I love the colors!!!  Each new level definitely challenges your mind!!!  It is for any age-group!!! :-)
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Now that I have reviewed all the individual songs on the album, it's time to review the album as a whole.<br />Right off the bat, I'm going to say, I am not a huge fan of Christmas music. I listen to it if it's playing, but rarely will I go out of my way to listen to holiday tunes. That being said, I'll give my opinion on this album on the basis of how much it will get listened to during the rest of the year.<br />There are a few songs that were released before this album and I have been listening to those since their individual releases. The other songs on the album are varied and round out a decent a CD for the holidays.<br />Several songs I will definitely be listening to year round. (Winter Wind, Christmas Morning and Good King Wenceslas to name a few.) A couple of the songs don't capture my attention like others, but that doesn't mean they aren't great additions to a Christmas CD.<br />From October through February, this CD will fill the air with the sounds of the holiday as interpreted by The Piano Guys. For the rest of the year, it gives me several new songs to add to my \\"any day, any time\\" playlist.<br />The DVD has the videos for the songs that were previously released and a Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer clip with Jon playing upside down. Plus a neat feature that plays the album while a fire burns on your tv.<br />Even a CD with nothing but Christmas songs is right at home with the rest of the Piano Guys Collection.
B002KGEORM|5.0|This was the first time I ever ordered a DVD for online streaming.  I love it that I can just watch the videos anytime I want with just a couple clicks of the mouse.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|When I look back at the trilogy all I mostly remember is death and sadness. I understand the real world and how that plays out day to day...but I felt after everything all the death and all the sadness leading up to the big finale...it was just so unnecessary.<br /><br />Like a lot of fans of the Divergent series's...I was so thrilled when I found the books. I read them once, twice, and probably to many times to count. There were so many inspiring quotes I kept for when bad times arose...BUT now after I finish the final book of the trilogy...I never want to re-read the trilogy again. I give Mrs. Roth the credit of good writing, but that is as far as I can go. To me she has only shattered the hope of this being a series I would love to read again for years to come.<br /><br />For those that might think a lot of us readers are over reacting or casting to many judgements... I know Mrs. Roth had her reasons for ending the book the way she did. I may not agree with them, but that is her choice as the author. As I mentioned before there was so much in the first two books of learning a of life, death, sacrifice, coping, etc. that I felt this was just overkill in book 3. People often read for a bit of reality but for also that slice of fairy tale that takes them away from all the things I have mentioned above. I am just sad that the Divergent series will not be that escape for me and that instead of remembering how good I knew it to be...that I only wish it stopped at book 2.<br /><br />At least the one aspect I love to walk away with:<br /><br />Be Brave!!
B00BZBPRBA|5.0|My family loves this movie. It's so cute and Mara Wilson is so darned cute. This movie is funny, sweet and cute. If you have children, watch it. You will watch it every time you are sad, just to get a pick me up.

0061928356|5.0|I just loved the way the author has bridged the emotional lives of two women from two very different cultures and yet seem so strongly connected.  The chapters are so well fabricated that you can emotionally relate with lives both, Somer and Kavita.  I really enjoyed the book, and looking forward to more reads from Ms. Gowda.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Good mix or action and drama. We thought it was well made. It seemed a bit short and they could have ended a little better
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This story never gets old and never will.  It has nice woodcut pictures illustrating the time period the story take place.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It is very thought provoking in regard to how our actions not only affect our own lives, but the lives of others.  A definite book club read!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike's book is fantastic! I've always struggled with keeping to a routine for years but now I have confidence in the routine he has suggested, I have no reason to doubt it or myself so I am happy to trust it and work away on it for the next year. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has never been able to keep a routine before, who's just starting out or has never felt like they have made progress. I'm nearing the end of my 3rd week in and I feel better because of it already and I'm already starting to see some changes. Mike really does successfully rid you of all the confusion that most people have of what to eat, how to workout and what to supplement with. He's honest and he's genuine. At the very least, read this book!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Dear Sir:<br /><br />The Video plays very good. Thank you for the sending it to me. I really appreciate it a lot.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This book has the short stories Rudyard Kipling is famous for writing.  I read these stories as a kid and they are still fun to read today.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was so good! I loved it. I can't wait for the the next book to come out! I can't wait for the new adventure!
B00FEN000S|3.0|As far as end-of-the-world action-packed stories go,  this one is entertaining. The plot is a little loose and the acting isn't out of this world,  but if you enjoy a monster vs man scenario with excellent CGI,  check this one out. But don't expect it to change your world or anything.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Loved this movie when i was a kid!! now my son love it too hes 3years old and will watch non stop
B0019NB9A2|5.0|After the Movie Metropolis this one brought Sifi in to the main stream of Hollywood movies. A widescreen movie in full color and a few cheesy special effects.  Robbie is  the Robot second best movie robot.  The woman robot from Metropolis is the Best one ever, but Robbie is more famous.  Love monsters from the Id.  The Krell and their learning machine.  Ann Francis should not have been in this movie.  This is a must have and in Blu Ray.

B00G4ZACLC|5.0|I feel the description for this game does not clearly &amp; accurately explain thoroughly enough, just exactly how it is to be played. I was truly bored; searching for almost any new Mahjong app to play when I came across Frozen Mahjong from Happy Planet Games. Although very hesitant; assuming this app was just another simple &amp; basic Winter-themed, Shanghai Mahjong style game, [to which I own several already that are all very similar] and, I'd only become bored with, in a matter of a mere one or two levels...I'd decided to purchase it anyway. I have bought from Happy Planet Games before and I really liked the Winter-themed tile set shown in the preview pictures, so I took a chance and I'm very pleased that I did!<br /><br />This Mahjong has a slightly different twist yet, the basic concept and rules for playing the game..all remain, exactly..the same! You'll still need to match two tiles in order to remove them from the board but, the difference is, instead of tiles behind, &quot;blocked&quot;, they are &quot;frozen&quot;. Once you have removed certain tiles from around the frozen tiles, this will, &quot;break the ice&quot; that surrounds them, allowing you to play them.<br /><br />The sound effects are wonderful. I didn't find them to be annoying at all, but for those who do, there is an option to turn off sound &amp; music. The tile set is a nice cartoonish, winter theme with snowmen, snow covered pine trees, reindeer, an igloo, a Penguin, etc., There are no set number of boards or layouts for you to play but rather, you play one board  then continue as long as you can, racking up your score until time runs out.  I haven't quite figured out just how much time you're given but I believe it depends on how many points you receive.<br /><br />If you're looking for something new in the world of Mahjong apps and you don't mind it being a little different or, being timed...then grab this one  for just under a buck! My only complaint would be the tiles are a bit on the small side and there is no option to zoom. So, unless you're downloading this to a tablet or have excellent eyesight,  I do not recommend installing on a phone.  Otherwise, I recommend checking out this surprisingly addictive little gem of game called... Frozen Mahjong!e small side and there is no option to zoom.

B0017SWSCW|5.0|Love this book.  Very well written and draws you in right away.  I highly recommend it` especially if you are a fan of Jeffrey Archer.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Heart touching! Definitely recommend it to others and I will certainly watch it again. Inspiring! Humorous! Informative! The list goes on.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|They did a great job with this one.  If you really liked the first two, then definitely get this one to add to the collection.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Ok.  The book itself is remarkably weak.  Sure, it's a page-turner, but as literature, it's bad.  What it really reveals is the mind of the author, completely consumed with his own wildly overinflated importance, with not so subtle hints of paranoia, homosexuality and troubling violent tendencies.  Why we feed this toxic sludge to children is beyond me.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I can't even describe it. You'll have to find out in the words of John Green. One of the best books I've ever read.
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|Very funny and different than 1 and 2. Enjoyable comedy! I would recommend it to anybody of most ages and movie lovers.
0817439390|5.0|I learned more in the first 15 pages of this book than I have from several others in years. Very well-written, great pictures to illustrate relevant points and what I really like is he incorporates simple exercises during the chapters. For example, he has you simply take three different pictures of the same thing, but changing the ISO setting between each exposure so that you can see how it directly affects the shutter speed. I'm literate and can read, but I learn a lot better when I can do some hands-on lessons and these are fantastic for a beginner like me. It made me more excited and interested in using my camera. I highly recommend this book!
034580404X|3.0|It was OK.........once you got to reading, it seemed rather predictable though.<br /><br />NOT something I would recommend.<br /><br />Can't for the life of me comprehend WHY they'd ever make a movie based on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game to pass time. Can be a bit addictive once you start to get the hang of the game and the objective of the level. Would definitely recommend.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It felt rushed compared to the first two books and it did lack the details of the previous books, but all in all it was pretty good.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love Grisham, but this had a Shawshank Redemption characteristic to it. As usual this was enjoyable reading full of mystery and suspense.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|Buyer beware, when buying DVD's BD's CD's when they say new that means the security tape is still on it.  Its kind of obvious when the tape is removed the the package was simply re-shrink wrapped.  Otherwise a value.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|The CD really brought back memories. I enjoy listening to it and singing along. I think favorably about past times. Great songs!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great addition. Have been waiting for it on Facebook for a long time. Love it. Play several times a day. Everyone plays candy crush
B006LA6IW2|4.0|I enjoyed reading, learned a lot about SEALS. RIP Chris and I hope all the men and women fighting for us are safe
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for a year so I can play candy crush again. My mom says that I have been playing it for a while.

B00AESN8XY|4.0|Intriguing &quot;brain food&quot; game. And you get the opportunity to tell any friends that ask, &quot;Hang on a minute, my plague/virus has almost infected the entire world.&quot; Lol<br /><br />It's the little things in life... ;-)
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Working on Literature at Duquesne University.  Plenty of information for me to work with.<br /><br />I will be able to replay as needed
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A must read .... loved every page. Kept your attention all the way through the book. I hate having to write so many words for a review. Good book though - read it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|The CD really brought back memories. I enjoy listening to it and singing along. I think favorably about past times. Great songs!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Cool fun game good for play amazing and best of all the graphicmoo ins are the best of all the graphics are way too cool
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The authors featured gave me insight into their life and times and pointed me in directions I had not explored.<br />I thought that the director used the hearsay about each to make each real.  It was stretched a little, but was more real than just words.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|In this app you drive a fire truck and try to put out flames. In the process you have bridges and obstacles, so you need to use the water smartly. Learning curve is fast, and the levels start off easy.  Kids love this, and with no intrusive permissions and no IAP I have no problem letting them play.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|A good story until the plot got convoluted. No one that insane could be that organized and so highly effective.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really do love this app. I wish I could get it on my android. The weather app I have there doesn't do everything this one does. I really love that I can get the cities where my friends and family live so I know what their weather is like at the touch of a button!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is very easy to navigate and with a perfect simplicity to it. I personally love the fact that you have the option to go by a 24 hour clock or the am and pm view of it.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I am a sucker for mind twisting movies and I thought this one was amazing.  If you like movies like Momento, Fight Club, or Swordfish, chances are you will like this movie as well.  It is one that I will certainly be buying to add to my collection.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a fun game. Not too hard to play and my kids love to play it too. Can get a bit costly so if you want a big army get ready to open your wallet. But with that as the only setback, get this game if you wanna have some military fun!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I just loved it, video streaming from google chrome and netflix, I use the most. But still, amazon video and apple videos opened in google chrome are not supported.<br /><br />There are most application google team should work on.. I guess, device is out there in market for few months and now as promised, nothing much has been done from Google to add more apps.<br /><br />I think they released device little prematurely. But I love it and great potential for future so I am keeping it.<br /><br />Shipment came real in time.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Lincoln Lawyer is a pretty good film based on a terrific set of books by Michael Connelly.  The time limit afforded by the film media is just not enough time to fully develop the plot and characters as much as I would have liked.  It still provides a very nice evening's entertainment.  I have read the book again after the film.  I recommend reading the book before watching the film.  I think it will add to the enjoyment of the film.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|Can't open past notes.<br />Can't Save current notes.<br />Can't find ANY note.<br /><br />Removed after 5 minutes.<br /><br />The Icon is the neatest part of the App.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />This book was truly the best, the ending was not anticipated. Given all that has happened the ending shouldn't have been as surprising, but Tris' death was not expected. Roth did a great job on this book and really made me thirst for more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so in love with this game. Was waiting so long for the kindle. Such an amazing game can't put it down
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|The graphics were good, and I wasn't stumped on puzzles. One took some time on the order of events but otherwise not bad. I personally did not like the ending, felt like I wasted time playing. Otherwise wasn't bad overall.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Like allot of others on here, I really wanted to like it.<br /><br />First one we received would never connect with our WIFI home network. Emailed the Withings customer support and except for an email asking how my support experience was, I never heard back from anyone.<br /><br />After about a week of troubleshooting decided it wasn't me or my network and returned it. Amazon was great - one click return and since I had originally used the overnight option, the return was the same - received it the next day. Without so much as a question about the one I was returning. Sweet. Boxed up the old one, used their return UPS label and off it went.<br /><br />New one finally worked as advertised. Connected via bluetooth, ran the setup, attached it to the WIFI and that was it. We were off.<br /><br />Worked great for the last 4 months.<br /><br />Now the USB Power port broke - detached from the motherboard without even touching it. Like the glue just broke.<br /><br />Since the last Withings support experience was non existent, I called Amazon to see if the HW Warranty could be done through them. They said no, it cant - but we will send you a replacement anyways. Do you want the old one back? Nope, just call the manufacturer and see if they want it but otherwise, have a nice day. Now that's customer service.<br /><br />So my review says Its ok, which is about all I can muster. Good idea, bad support, kind of weak manufacturing quality, but when it works, it does everything I need it to: IOS access, local and over the internet with good pic and sound quality.<br /><br />Amazon on the other hand has been great all the way through.<br /><br />NOTE: 10/28 - Received replacement in the mail today. Plugged it and connected via bluetooth, and noticed immediately that the lens is out of focus. Looks like the auto-focus isn't working. Its focused if your about two inches from the lens, but thats it. Also, the color is all washed out - everything is pink like there is something over the lense (there isn't) and totally burned/washed out in the contrast'y hot places (like where a bright light is).<br /><br />So it powers up and connects to wifi, but no focus and tinted. At this point, I'm calling it - It's a piece of junk. Dont buy it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series was great. It kept my attention from beginning to end and I think it ended appropriately. Those who wanted a sappy love story with a happy ending should have probably stayed away from dystopian fiction...
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been through so many cheaper alternatives and these are definitely worth the extra money if audio quality is important to you.
B001NA6096|5.0|Highly recommend this movie to all those hopeless romantics out there.  My husband liked this one and watched the sequel as well.
006178480X|5.0|James Rollins does a great job of being interesting and cool with an edge of the unexplainable mixed in. Very entertaining reading! I'm trying to read all the Sigma Force Novels. I love the characters!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So disappointed... this book ruined the whole trilogy for me.  I didn't even finish reading it after the main character was killed off. Save your money and don't buy the book.
0307408833|5.0|I received it in a timely mannner.  I also got it for a very good price and have recommended it to my friends.  It was in very good condition, and most of all the recipes in it are awesome.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a romantic side.  My husband even dared to watch it with me and liked it.  I can't wait to see &#34;Before Midnight&#34; which is the last one of the series.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I Love Kik so why is it not working?!.I've tried logging in and all only to see kik is no longer available.  Please please please bring my Kik back.
B001MM28JG|4.0|I watched this on tv and really enjoyed it, so I'm buying the DVD to give to a friend. I didn't expect much from the description on tv, but it was really fun. Tim Allen does a great job, as does the rest of the notable cast. Time well spent on a lazy Sunday afternoon!
B007EC27QM|4.0|VERY EASY to use. It has a natural feel to it.<br /><br />The display clearly shows all your operations.<br /><br />The keys are of oerfect size for my hands.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|SPOILERS BELOW!!*********************<br />4 or 5 stars? Well, I am heartbroken. For sure. But, I am not sure I am completely disappointed. Did I get what I hoping for out of this book? No. I must have read Divergent and Insurgent at least 7 times. I read them quickly, with excitement and adrenaline, and I read them slowly trying to relish every word. As I read Allegiant, I sometimes rushed along with the momentum, thinking that I will re-read and take the time to truly think about each sentence next time. But, I honestly do not think I can re-live that again. I forced myself to finish the book, not wanting to believe what had happened. I wish this book was released after the Divergent film, because I am not even sure I can put myself through this tale again knowing of Tris' death.<br />Do I think it was the wrong ending? I'm not so sure. I like happily ever afters. A lot of reviewers have applauded this ending for being messy and brave, and difficult. But, we have plenty of dramas and heartache in our lives. When I read a book, or watch a movie, I do steer towards feel-good ones, even if they are not realistic. It is a nice escape, and I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting that.  I also think, that in this case, it would have been interesting to see Tris face a normal life. As long as we have known her, she has had a fire within her to do something big and meaningful. And she was amazing! But, her whole existence was to be an instigator. To intervene, make bold choices, to take risks, make sacrifices, and try to fix things. She was told over and over again that she was unique, special, and powerful. I think it would have been more challenging for her, more brave even, to just be normal in the end. I say this because I think that is a part of the process for most young adults becoming adults. So many of us are told that we can be whatever we want to be, and do whatever we want to do, and that is great. Every child should have the self-confidence to follow their dreams. But, the reality is that we do not all grow up to be the astronaut, the NFL player, the movie star, or the Nobel Prize winner that we dreamed we would be. Instead of feeling like failures, or being disappointed with ourselves, at some point the majority of us have to be brave enough to be ok with just being normal. We have to find contentment and happiness with what we do achieve, and choose to make a difference in even the smallest ways, because it is cumulative. I think that would have been Tris' grown up moment. She was not invincible, and she could have chosen to be content with the work she had done, and worked toward change in a less self destructive way. It would have been a significant character development to show, and she never got there. So, I regret that for her. But, she was a hero. Maybe that was the best she could offer the others. And it certainly was the most harrowing and dramatic contribution to the story.<br />There is a part of me that does find closure with this story though, and respect for Veronica Roth's story telling. Tris' motivations were strongly linked to her mother all along. While she also thought about what her father would want her to do, with every new revelation she made about her mother in Divergent and Insurgent, you could see her direct her actions toward emulating her. Throughout Insurgent, she was focused on finishing her mother's work. In Allegiant, as she uncovered the rest of her mother's story, it was clear what she truly felt she had to do. She had no other choice. It was always her driving force. I thought her mother's choice to be \\"normal\\" and live in Abnegation instead of finishing her work to help the genetically damaged in the Fringe was extremely compelling. I don't know if Natalie was taking the harder path to turn away from the conflict outside and try to be \\"normal\\", or if it was easier for her to choose that path and relinquish herself from the feeling it was her obligation to save the world. She still made a difference. She still saved lives and helped others. But, she helped herself too. I admire her for that. But, at the same time, it was clear that she had unfinished business, and Tris felt a deep devotion to completing that work. It was something that Caleb was never going to be capable of doing, so it had to be Tris. It had to. And it required sacrifice. That was her choice.<br />Would it have been nice for us if she had released the serum, AND lived and reunited with Tobias? Yes. But, here is why I think that maybe wasn't the right way to go: Veronica Roth said that she first wrote Divergent from Tobias' perspective. Now I believe that this whole story is really about Tobias, and his growth. Not Tris. I really do. And, now that I see that, I think it was incredibly interesting for Veronica Roth to write the first two books from the perspective of a different character. To experience Four/Tobias through Tris' eyes, and then to experience him through his own voice, was a very complex and deliciously addictive ride. It was so multi-dimensional. She told his story from the way he saw himself, but also from how others saw him. From how someone who chose to love him saw him. In a very twisting way. I can't think of another character sketch (or really a fictional biography) told just quite like this. Tobias was always a broken person, way before he was told he was genetically damaged. I feel like this story is about how Tris facilitated him living through this tragedy and developing into the person he wanted to be. The leader he was meant to become. He had to learn to LET GO. Forgiveness, love, and trust. She completely affected how he interacted with the people and situations around him. This was about him making peace with a traumatic past and becoming an adult. And I never looked at this story like that until the end. I am grateful to Veronica Roth for creating such an interesting tale that was powerfully told. Even if I don't think I can reread and relish it all over and over again like I hoped I could.<br />I actually think my main disappointment with Allegiant was that Uriah's story fell short. I thought he was a very interesting and important character in Divergent. I was upset that his character was cut out of the film. In Insurgent, he was mysterious and delightful, and he helped us bear the phase of Tris, the downer. I loved that he was Divergent, but that he seemed different from the others. He was smart, and thoughtful. I was so sure that he was going to play a key role in Allegiant, and I am let down that it was only his body and memory that played a significant part. I really wanted to see more become of him. But, now that I feel like this was always about Tobias, I guess that really wasn't very important. Can't believe it is over! Worth the read, but keep tissues by your side!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have already ordered the second book although I still have nearly 100 pages to go in the first. What more can one say?
B0000TB014|5.0|I purchased this for my 2 year old son. He is obsessed with the Michael Jackson. Sometimes randomly when watching his cartoons, he will ask for this video then sing and dance.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!  Definitely the best game and totally worth the dollar if you like high quality racing games.  I have been on the couch playing this game an hour a day.  You should definitely buy this game.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My granddaughter loves this and keeps her busy while driving.  She has become addicted to my kindle but it is a good addiction.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great , use it all the time. nice to have  a calculator handy.<br />Thats all I have to say about this
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Enjoy playing this game---the challenge is great and can't stop playing it. So many combinations to acheive and are you up to the challenge???
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a perfect ending to a beautifully tragic story. It wasn't the happy fairytale ending that almost everyone wanted but that is what makes it so great. Books should make you think and this one definitely does!<br />Great job Veronica Roth! Can't wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great book.  I have been passing my books on to friends. They keep telling me to hurry up so they can read. As a teacher, I always encourage people and students to read.It doesn't  go by age. I have helped adults read,and I start with Mr. Patter sons books. They leave the person wanting to read more.thank you,Mr.Patterson
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I wish this book made more sense, but it is sadly lacking in any.  The reasons for the &#34;experiment&#34; are weak at best.  It briefly explains some level genetic tampering that leads to a civil war, but does not explain about the rest of the world.  I find it hard to believe the survivors of the civil war aren't aware of even Canada when this is set in Chicago.  There is no record of wars prior to the genetic war?  I don't get this fringe thing.  Seems like people are living in huts but there are houses around?  The rest of this world is so well developed that this just seems a bit of a let down.  Also, I find it just hard to believe a person who commits an act of sabotage would be given the level of freedom that is granted in this book.  The characters just walk around unmonitored?  Seriously, they monitor a whole society but not a high security building?  Just seems unlikely.  I think it could have ended a bit happier too, but even if it did I wouldn't have given it any higher than 3 stars.  Most of the book is unbelievable at best.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|I watched this movie many years ago in my teens. and always wanted a copy to replace my old VHS tapes. well worth the money and an entertaining movie to boot.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Suffice it to say that I'm a big fan of this series.  It's clever and funny.  I highly recommend it.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Cool game I liked it I think it's dumb that. It takes so long to regain  energy  to fight but other than that I liked it. :)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is a Spoiler free but Detailed Review of Allegiant.<br /><br />I never was a fan of this trilogy but I wanted to finish it to see how it will all end up and it was poorly wrapped up and a slap in the face to people who are fans.<br /><br />In all honesty this was not good at all. It was Boring. It took way too long to get to the point and to be honest except the very end, far too much was EASY for the characters. Up until the end of the book, there was really no challenge. Anything they did they more or less got away with.<br /><br />1. Plot & Writing<br /><br />This book continues off of the events of Insurgent where Tris has revealed the recording of Edith Prior and the people are now being held against their will by Tobias' Four mother.<br /><br />You would have thought after the events of Book 2 that Book 3 would more or less be adrenaline rushed and non-stop.<br /><br />WRONG....For about the first 20 or so chapters of the book, the book is a bit slow. Yeah there are a few action scenes or intense scenes but for nearly 1/3 of the book it is mainly Tris & Four just sitting around talking.  Talking about their relationship, talking about the plans of what they are going to do, talking about this, talking about that.<br /><br />It was boring to be honest. This is mean to be the final book...you are supposed to go out with a bang and let it be non-stop where the book barely gives you a chance to breathe...Instead, I got bored quite a bit and did the skim reading thing.<br /><br />But then if the first 1/3- 1/2 of the book was slow, then last 1/2 was a bit too rushed. The ending of the book was sort of anti-climatic in a way and I can see why so many people are pissed with the ending. I would be pissed as well if I was a die hard fan. Too much time was spent focused on a less important plot that the biggest shocker of all sort of is just glazed over and I was like...Really? That's how you want to end it.<br /><br />I will say what i enjoyed about this Book compared to the other 3...We get POV from Both Four & Tris. Every other chapter switches between their pov and it really allows you to get into the head of Four(more on this later).<br /><br />2. Characters<br /><br />This book switches between Four & Tris and it does so very well but a lot of time it almost feels like they are the same person. Tris even admits her relationship with FOur is more serious as they don't really have a sense of humor.<br /><br />I've honestly never really cared for their relationship....Tris doesn't have much chemistry with Four and up until Book 3 Four has always seemed one-dimensional to me. I enjoyed getting to know about Four in this book but to be honest...his Parental issues were getting on my nerves. Had this been Book 1 or 2, I wouldn't have minded but this is Book 3 and Four spends most of this book just whining and whining and it's like dude...it's time to get over it.<br /><br />Four also does something completely stupid and ignorant that has horrible consequences and I thought Okay...FINALLY, Four/Tris will become interesting but that only lasts for a couple of chapters and then it is back to \\"Woe is Me\\" Four.<br /><br />Tris was equally boring. She spends the first half of the book sort of doing nothing really but investigating and reading but nothing memorable. The last half of the book, she starts to come alive but for her to be a protagonist and the lead character she was boring. Four, despite all his whining, was far more interesting because at least he had major development.<br /><br />One thing I hate about Tris is that I miss the Tris we sort of saw in Abnegation in Book 1. It's like as soon as she got to Dauntless she became this hard-ass and lost her Abnegation side most of the time. I didn't care about Tris at all in this book.<br /><br />Secondary characters....Eh, they were not that interesting.<br /><br />Peter is here in this book but what was the Point of Peter except a choice he makes at the end? If Peter is going to make a big decision like he did in the end, then give the boy more screentime. He'd be in a scene but he just wouldn't talk. He was literally just there for the book.<br /><br />Christina was likeable and did very well in her supporting role...especially at the end of the book. I enjoyed Christina and I wish she had a little more to do than her sarcasm and being the good friend role.]<br /><br />Caleb had some great development and I did enjoy Tris in her scenes with him. I actually like the character of Caleb because he shows the desperation and flaws of Human nature all in one character.<br /><br />I Also love cara and her quips and sarcasm. She certainly brought humor to the story in her scenes and I am so glad we got Cara in this book.<br />There are a bunch of other secondary characters who are more or less one-dimensional and are merely there to further the plot along.<br /><br />3. Overall<br /><br />This was not a satisfying end to the trilogy.  It was too slow in some parts and the ending not only felt rushed it feels like it sorts of cheats fans of the trilogy.<br /><br />I am no fan but if you are going to go for that ending, give it more of an UMPH and don't make it feel like it is tacked on.<br /><br />I also got a major Hunger games rip-off this book...Especially with Mockingjay. Like there is an event in the book that makes me think of mockingjay and i was like really, that's the best you can come up with?<br /><br />While we discovered the root of the factions, it just feels a bit meh. When the characters discover the truth about the factions and the outside world and what may be out there, i wanted more from them but instead we got more talking and more talking.<br /><br />The biggest thing that annoyed me was Tris/Four in this book. Their relationship troubles are always so petty. They fight over the dumbest of things only to make up a chapter or two later. But they have a legit reason to have an issue and Tris is one of those girls I hate. They credit the fact that they are a strong person to the fact that their man made them feel that way.<br /><br />Really? So had she never met four would Tris always be some shy and quiet abnegation girl? I mean she picked Dauntless before she had even met Four so i would think she'd still be strong and brave even without Four.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />I am so glad this series is over....Definitely a 1.5 out of 5 Stars read.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works great!  Played it on the ipod and now have it in my Kindle Fire.  Great fun!  I have to add more words to my review so here are some.  Gladiator.  Turnip.  Las Vegas.  OK made it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to finally have this game available in the Amazon app store. Totally addicting I can't put it down!
B002KDSBGA|4.0|I have read this book 3 times once in high school,  as a young mother, and as a mature adult.  I loved it and enjoyed it every time.  As for the movie the actors are exceptional.  I love Gregory Peck as Attticus.  The children Gem and Scout we so fun to watch.  We have seen the movie numerous times.  We introduced it to our children when they were young.  Most recently we watched it with friends who had never seen it before.  They loved it.  I don't know if this movie could ever be better done.  I love it's innocence and truth of the time.
B000063UR1|5.0|I watched this movie many years ago in my teens. and always wanted a copy to replace my old VHS tapes. well worth the money and an entertaining movie to boot.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This is amazing and upbeat. I wanna just dance when I listen and I feel good! Very ADDICTIVE IN EAR PHONES
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best $35 I ever spent for entertainment purposes. This gadget works exactly as claimed, perfect transmission, no problems whatsoever. Installs in five minutes, easy to understand instructions, can't find a thing to complain about.
B00338QENI|4.0|Too much of the author's own story clogs the book, like &#34;look at me, you should make me a saint for getting the story!&#34; Otherwise, it was still an interesting and informative read. It brings up a lot to think about with tissues, research, and the patient.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|this movie is entertaining if you like american gangs, very good story line and great lovable characters. a good thumbs up.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Nice games, addicting.  I enjoy the fact that you are asked by friends to give lives.  I enjoy the different levels
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote, man, what can I say, this app is great, in always on the go, at work in usual on the move and don't have my laptop with me, but I always have my kindle with me. Evernote keeps all of my notes and projects in 1 easy to use app. If you're a member of the mobile life style, you need this!!
0316204366|1.0|Back in 1999, Arnold Schwarzenegger, an admitted steroid user, successfully sued a German doctor, Dr. Willi Heepe, for predicting that said bodybuilder would die an early death because of his steroid use. The case Schwarzenegger's lawyers made was that since Dr. Heepe had never examined Schwarzenegger personally, he was in no position to comment on his health.<br /><br />But what does this have to do with Malcolm Gladwell's book, David and Goliath? A lot, actually. In his charismatic narration of the Biblical story of the duel between David and Goliath, Gladwell offers a possible exposé of the unlikely victory that was. He submits, based upon several factors, that Goliath suffered from acromegaly and had a pituitary tumor behind his eyes which David took advantage of in defeating him.<br /><br />Whatever be the conclusions Gladwell derives, and is welcome to derive, from this, there are two critical errors he commits in his analysis of the story that shouldn't be overlooked: One, that Gladwell, despite having no formal training whatsoever in medical science, feels comfortable in making a diagnosis that only the most well trained medical professionals should have the right to diagnose; two, the diagnosis is made based not on any real scientific or medical data but on the grammatical anomalies of a numerously translated text that's not only more than 2000 years old but is also rooted in hearsay (let alone the fact that a rotating sling from a close enough distance can fool anybody with even a 20/20 vision as a multiple).<br /><br />To be fair (or unfair, depending on how you look at it), this idea of diagnosing Goliath isn't Gladwell's. Several unscrupulous charlatans have attempted this malice before, but Gladwell brings it to a wider audience owing to his popularity without showing an ounce of responsibility or ethical conduct. It's easy to divert attention by ascribing importance to the conclusion of the analysis rather than the method of analysis, but diagnosingsomeone without having the authority or sufficient and valid information to do so isn't as benign as it seems and his readers might take it as a sign of encouragement to follow feat. It quickly becomes a social phenomenon, a notorious example of which comes from the `repressed memory' cult of the 90s where callous pop psychology writers (i.e., writers on psychology with no formal training or certification) and overzealous social workers encouraged people to come forward with accusations of molestation against their own parents, despite the undeniable evidence for implanted false memories that can feel as real as repressed memories, which all culminated in the much publicized trial and subsequent exoneration of George Franklin.  There is absolutely no reason for any layman to assume the power to either self-diagnose or diagnose another human being with a life-altering disease, and as little a reason for any formally trained medical professional to do the same without examining the patient or the valid diagnostic data, be the patient alive or long dead.<br /><br />One would expect a writer of Gladwell's reputation to eschew such callousness, but his blatant disregard for social responsibility just to make a point - a point which could easily have been made using modern examples of a seeming underdog defeating an inexorable giant, of which there are plenty - proves the lack of the very thing he is trying to prove he possesses: intellect. If you are looking for a well-deduced synthesis, look elsewhere.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|this is a fantastic movie and yul bryner is great as the out of control robot/cyborg. brings back old memories of watching it as a kid.
B000LX00RY|5.0|This is a funny chick flik that helps me get through a rough week. I like that the lead character isn't some damsel in distress...
1781162646|5.0|Kept me interested throughout.  Was sorry it ended!  I hope Mr. King does more of these novels.  Very, very enjoyable!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King at his finest. Not a sequel to the movie, this is a sequel to The Shining. Read that first if you're feeling lost. Excellent work from the Master of the Macabe.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|this is an entertaining alien movie with fantastic graphics and a whole lot of action to boot. well worth the watch
B00049QQHI|5.0|When I first saw this movie on TV back in the late 90's (complete with cuts and lousy edits), I didn't really care for it much. I knew it had to do with drugs and basketball. However, in 2011, I saw the movie in full (uncut, to be more precise) on DVD. And now I can appreciate it even more. Aside from DiCaprio's riveting performance, I can see just how tragic the fall from grace had become. I can't be sure if Jim Carroll's autobiographical account is completely accurate in this film, but I don't think it matters here. The story, which involves sports and drugs and redemption, is compelling enough for me to recommend it. Fantastic performances from DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Hudson, and others. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.<br /><br />Would I say that this film is perfect? Of course, not. It does have its few flaws (a couple of moments of lousy dialogue and overacting), but they're minimal and aren't distracting in the slightest. The Basketball Diaries is one that shouldn't be overlooked, as it has to be one of the most underrated films from the 90's.<br /><br />Grade: 8.3 out of 10
1490313370|5.0|The world has changed and it will never be the same. These are tough words to hear but it is reality. James Altucher gives good advice here on how to stay strong and deal with life's issues. It all goes back to what the flight attendants tell you on every flight...in case of an emergency make sure you get your oxygen before you help the person beside you. Otherwise you are no good to anyone, including yourself.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's super fun. Not super hard but  not super easy. Wish there was more levels. It over all rally like this game.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I recently downloaded this app and find it fun and challenging. The math problems sound easy enough until you start tge timer! I look forward to exploring the other games and sharpening my weak mental math skills.
B00499NHLC|5.0|BC is a great Sherlock, and Martin is a much more believable Watson.  These guys are great at whatever they do.  The stories are brand new and taking place in the present.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun game. In later levels it is not easy to collect the millions of dollars required to expand the village. Fun and fast. Pretty graphics.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This is a good movie, ive seen this movie before in theatres so i bought this. I finished watching it and I couldn't figure out what was added in this extended version. I googled the differences . The movie added more shots and more of people's reaction (plus more blood). There is over 100 different things from the theatrical version but they are minimal, like certqim acenes could be only 6 seconds new features and some point, overall it was good, in this package i got the blu ray uncut extended version, theatrical DVD, and hd iTunes digital copy, it's not the unrated one for iTunes but its okay!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so funn for any ages my 18 year old sister love this game she can not get off the opossum because of it I live this game even though im 15...
006202406X|1.0|My poor daughter just came up the stairs crying and saying that the book ruined her life.<br />That's horrible that a writer just gives up on her own characters and her readers.<br />She knows that she is writing for teens.  Like she doesn't know that they<br />have enough garbage to deal with today. Shame on you Veronica Roth.<br />She won't be watching your stupid movie either.<br />Fair warning; I hope you're not writing anymore books.  She won't<br />be reading those either.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I love match three games and download every free (and many pay) game I can find.  I try them ALL out.  This has to be the WORST I've encountered and I'm shocked because everyone raves about it.  I think this must simply be because people have not found the many highly superior (many Candy themed) match 3 games out there that are TRULY FREE or very inexpensive to play.  This game not only looks pretty shabby (for a beautiful spectacular looking Candy match 3 game check out the free Candy Deluxe Pro available free here on Amazon) but it is also so limiting in what it allows you to do that it literally becomes unplayable.  Don't want to wait for two and a half hours when you run out of your very limited 5 lives?  PAY US MONEY or log onto Facebook and spam your friends.  Once you reach level 35 the game is truly desperate to get your money so it will not allow you to move to the next level until you pay the ransom or play 3 \\"quests\\" which are merely levels you have already played. Okay, I can do that.  Play and beat the first \\"quest\\" level and guess what?  You may not play again for 24 hours to do the second quest!  When you beat that one you wait ANOTHER 24 hours to play the final one.  This is the only game I have ever played that prohibits you from playing the game.  It isn't really much of a game either as it is deliberately and obviously rigged in much the same ways as a carny hucksters game.  You will NOT beat a level until the game decides that you will (generally when you are using your final life - a cynical ploy to get you to pay for more lives).  Level design is also so difficult that in advanced levels you will almost certainly have to pay for (outrageously expensive) \\"boosters\\" to move on.<br /><br />I really don't get it.  The only explanation for the popularity/social phenomenon nature of this game is that people have not played the MANY better ones.  For awesome Candy themed match 3 games try: CANDY DELUXE PRO, CANDY SWIPED, CANDY OF KING, MO CANDY (thatone is 99cents), CANDY POP. For great match 3's in general try JEWEL STAR, JEWEL LEGENDS, DRAGON GEM, HEROES of KALEVALA, SEASONS MATCH ... so many great ones.  The ones that require you to pay (cheap too) give you the ENTIRE game, not just pay to progress a little further and then pay again. The fawning reviews here mystify me, particularly the ones that seem so happy the game is \\"finally\\" available on Amazon.  The reason the game took so long to come out is so the game will get a huge new influx of players to make it seem like interest in the game is not diminishing (which it does do fairly quickly, at least for my friends who have tried it and quit playing it when in became annoying).  CANDY CRUSH is a truly disappointing and I think, rather despicable mess.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun. Very entertaining . Every game is a little different than the one before it. Love the challenges.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I started with season one and watched all three seasons.  Can't wait to see season four on TV in January.!!!.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love that i can play candy crush on my kindle. just awesome.  now i dont have to replace my kindle with  a ipad. thanks amazon
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the series. It is a great read. I enjoy a highly descriptive book, this was no dissapointment. If the sex scenes were removed it would still be a great love story.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|I am not sure what you are trying to do here? Is this your hello world in App form? No features what so ever and the graphics look low res and blocky. Please don't actually ever take anyones money for this application. Two stars for no permissions on an app that does nothing. Also note has saved correctly? Wtf kinda verbage is that?
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have never had the ebay app before, but have had situations where I wanted to bid on something, but wasn't close to my desktop.  With the addition of the ebay app, if I want to bid on an item I can do it anywhere I happen to be!  I would recommend it to anyone that buys from ebay, have the convenience to bid right at your fingertips!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I ENJOY UNWINDING at lunch during the day playing CC...also after a hectic day at work. Helps me take my mind off work and the world. Love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and keeps you coming back to finish. I'm looking forward to more levels! I plan on finding more games like this one. It good for you brainstorm figure these out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun for all ages,dose no  include violence and you can interact with your horse you can also get task to keep you busy so you won't have to stare at your horse all day mean while you take photos of it &amp; play cool games.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I gave this 5 stars - because I can be on facebook when and where I want to be, and there are times that is handy!  I only wish that I could play my games also, but can't on the kindle unfortunately.  Great for keeping in contact though, which is what I wanted it for!  If you want to stay in contact even when your traveling or not at home - it is fantastic!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Great movie and great price! Especially with all the more expensive versions. Very fast delivery. If you just want to see movie and not worried about the HD, IMAX features, this is best bet!
B009YN2M7S|4.0|He writes a good love story without resorting to the romantic/novela form of writing love stories.  He is a good writer to relax with.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have always loved The Wonderful Wizard of OZ movie with Judy Garland and watched it every year.  I never read the book until now.  What an excellent read.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|(As a lifelong Beatlemaniac, it's an honor and a privilege to be the first person ever to review this album here on Amazon.com!)<br /><br />Although he may not be the original Paul McCartney, I enjoy this `Paul' even more than the original.  He's been churning out hits far longer than the original Paul ever did.  So it's unfair to label him as a fraud, even though he is impersonating Paul McCartney.  This guy has been Paul longer than Paul was Paul!!!  So I say we give him a free pass on the fraud thing.  As long as he keeps recording great albums like this, he's OK in my book.<br /><br />Although this New album is not quite on the same level of greatness as his greatest masterpiece (Sgt. Peppers), it's a notch above lesser works like Rubber Soul and Beatles For Sale.<br /><br />Four stars.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Fantastic so real and very clear It was like watching the movie all over again Please go out and buy this
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good graphics and reminds me of Diablo. Decent story and interesting characters. I would recommend this game to friends. The update was quite large though.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It was a very good read. My first Kindle book and I will read more of them.
B004PGO25O|1.0|I bought the book hoping that it will be a great help,<br />It is nonsense! I went trough half of the book, and the ONLY useful sentence was \\"Don't procrastinate\\" !!<br />What do you mean?! I didn't pay to waste my time !<br />It is a very superficial work (pamphlet)
B009A87X80|5.0|Great buying experience.  Eva Cassidy has the voice of an angel.  Great sound quality, it really does her voice justice. Gorgeous!
0736092269|5.0|Totally met my expectations. I read many reviews and they are spot on. The book clearly shows exercises, stretches and movements in a clear and concise way. Nothing fancy or trendy here, just good old basic moves and anatomy. Definitely something any lifter should own. I'll be looking into the other books as well.
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Its a nice product I would recomend to anyone who is intrested in buying iPhone case i m very satisfied
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I played this on my iPod touch and I have a pretty good town on it. Now I also have it on my Kindle Fire HD and it is just as great. I totally recommend it to anyone who likes game where you can create towns and interact with them, and people who like The Oregon Trail! Again, this is a GREAT game! I love it!
0061537969|5.0|Loved the dog...and the book.  What a lovely thought:  dogs are our best friends sometimes and perhaps they do live on!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|EXCELLENT.  Thank U!
0316055433|5.0|Donna Tartt has surpassed herself.  Never a writer to skimp on words, she uses every one of the 700-plus pages of this monster to total effect.  In Theo and Boris she has created the most likable bad boy twosome since Butch and Sundance.  And the suspense is masterfully managed and heightened by the wonderful full-payoff ending.  I am glad Donna Tartt took so long to write this book.  It looks like her masterpiece to me.
B00081912E|5.0|I really love this movie, is just one of the MUST HAVE classics of all time. If you want to laugh out loud and really enjoy a good movie, that feels as good as when it came out, I highly recommend it to you. Jimm Carey is just HILARIOUS!
0984536159|5.0|a fascinating insight of a period of the history of Europe from the perspective of a man who had lived under the social conditions of the Habsburg monarchy, fought during the first world war and was a corner stone in the second. the author expresses an intimate account of the behaviour and approach of marxism and society's failures and weaknesses in failing to deal with its opposition. a complete understanding is given for the reasons of jewish exclusion in economics, politics and the organs of public opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game I love candy crush saga it is a very good game and I love it. very good graphics. and fun
0152465073|3.0|This was not the original translation and had been changed. I preferred the original translation as it was more charming. For someone who wasn't familiar with the original translation, perhaps this would be fine.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|This album is as good as ANYTHING Mot&ouml;rhead has EVER done in the last... 40 YEARS!?!?! In fact, the sounds on this record almost purposely reflect it. No offense to the band, but the last couple records had sort of a stale guitar tone, not here, VERY organic compared to the last couple records, I am FEELING this one, BIG TIME!!! Mot&ouml;rhead RULES!!! Lemmy, Phil and Mikkey... Thank you, you guys ALWAYS bring the SHAKE!!! \m/
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Alison Goldfrapp's vision come to life. A masterpiece of Goldfrappiness.<br /><br />First, this album is not Felt Mountain (it is \\"Tales of Us\\").<br />If you want to listen to Felt Mountain, listen to Felt Mountain (because Felt Mountain is Felt Mountain).<br /><br />This album is haunting and dreamy and all the rest that everyone else here has already said.<br />It plunges into disturbing depths of sickening betrayal, personal anguish, intense longing. Then at times there's a hungry, wanton energy - but never does it break completely free of a psychological weight that pulls at you.<br /><br />I felt a kind of twisting, akin to nausea, after the first few listenings. The music/lyrics/themes vaguely remind you of something... you felt before... a long time ago...<br />what was it?...<br /><br />This is quintessential Goldfrapp. No matter what, you never feel NOTHING. Alison doesn't do cotton candy. She doesn't do happy-go-lucky pop. She's not trendy (but is trend-setting, IMO). She's not serving her fans music on a platter. She's more a chef willing to let you taste her creations.<br /><br />The album a work of art - not so much a grouping of entertaining little jigs / pop singles. You don't play this at a Bar-B-Que for your friends. Its very personal and it makes you FEEL a certain way. Not every piece of art is for everyone, but if you are a fan of Goldfrapp you will not be disappointed. I absolutely disagree with whoever said that \\"none of the lyrics stand out and grab you\\" ---- \\"Simone\\" simply kills me (about a daughter who betrays her mother by sleeping with mother's lover): haunting, sinister, gut-wrenching. The mixture of melancholy and anxiety in \\"Jo\\" takes me to a dark place that you sunshine and unicorns to pull out of. \\"Drew\\" seems to be a dreamy memory, opening a window and letting in the air. I agree with the others here with regard to Annabel and Clay - strong tracts as well. It just goes on and on like that - one level, to the next, to the next. No interludes. No filler. And yes, best listened to as a whole (otherwise its somewhat like looking at the corner of a grand oil painting). By the end, you've been completely transported to another place. Classic Goldfrapp - a musical hypnotic, swallowed on a rainy day, while looking through old photographs, then stumbling upon a unopened letter...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft its fun and you can get a lot of things and have pets and plant seeds and boulder your own house
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|We own a small dog and we always joke about how the dog believes she is a wild wolf.  This book explores the idea that there is something in all dogs that reminds them of their roots. Something that calls to them.  if you are a dog lover this book can be a tough read at times. Still it is beautiful and Buck's loyalty will reinforce that they are loyal companions to the bitter end.
1476727651|5.0|This book is great, humor with suspense; truly Stephen King at his best!  A must read if you are a fan.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Love this game. Find myself losing track of time while I play.. highly addictive and fun to play.  Highly recommend this game.
B00A0SICYI|4.0|Great quality film. Great songs. Great for most kids. Has some questionable content - so parents might want to review before showing to children under 7
0761129235|5.0|This book has changed my life. Period. No more trying to change on a dime. It never works. Americans have an aversion to small change. I think it's because of the phrase &#34;baby steps&#34; and nobody wants to be a baby. Anyhow, get this book and apply the concepts. Change WILL happen over time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it to pieces, great game. Can be aggravating at times but I still play it all the time!!! Worth much more than free!!
B000JPRPAO|3.0|Entertaining film that was action, funny, and light - great for the family.  Looking for more like it. Yes we are.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|I missed the entire series on tv and so am watching the episodes now season by season late at night after my kids are in bed through Amazon Instant Video on my iPad!  This quickly has become an addiction!!  I love watching the entire series all at once but it is so intense doing so because the acting is so incredibly awesome that the next morning I sometimes feel like I'm actually IN the show!  Strange but true.  One of the most amazing shows I've ever seen.  Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Skylar, Marie, Hank, Jr,. they are right up there with The Sopranos other realistic fictional characters that blur the lines of what's real because the acting and writing is amazing and the story is just SO good.  It's impossible to stop watching it--- But of course most people already knew all this about this highly acclaimed show.  I'm just coming to realize it 6 years later.  As I'm watching the end of Season 4, I'm already dreading that it all comes to an end in Season 6.<br /><br />This is my first experience using Amazon Instant Video.  It should be called Amazing Instant Video.  I am literally able to watch any video I could possibly think of in one-click on my iPad in any location I choose?  It's actually easier and has a much better selection than my cable provider!!  Thankfully it has worked flawlessly throughout my two week Breaking Bad addiction.  Thank you Amazon---
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I would like it better if the game ask if you are sure when you fat finger as you are scrolling down the list of stuff to buy.
B00DJYJQ36|1.0|http://www.amazon.com/Before-Midnight-Blu-ray-Hawke/product-reviews/B00DJYJQ36/ref=cm_cr_pr_hist_5?ie=UTF8&filterBy=addFiveStar&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending<br /><br />Most of the entire movie is composed of an insipid dialog between two relatively unattractive middle aged persons whose conversation might be expected to take place between (modern day) high school kids. The common reviewer's line applies here: \\"the worst movie I have ever seen\\". I don't believe it even qualifies being called a 'movie' (in the usual every day sense).
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I was assigned this book for my psychology class the first time I read it was because I had to now I read it because I want to.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I really enjoy this app, especially the collage when making family pics of the children. It's easy to use with easy to follow instructions.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, I only wish it didn't take until the end of the book for him to realize he was in love with her.
006202406X|1.0|I can't believe she wrote this ending. I loved the first two books. Now I wish I would have never read the ending of this book.  She ended the trilogy awfully.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|CHEAP,OLD TECH,PICTURE QUALITY NOT GOOD,KEEP CRASHING,FREEZING,NOT RESPONDING<br />IF YOU HAVE SMART TV YOU DONT NEED IT<br />FU..ING GOOGLE THEY CHEAT PEOPLE CHEAP STUFF
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|As quoted above - really exciting.  Can hardly wait for the next disk.  Unfortunately, I don't have Showtime.<br />My one hesitation - the film seems to be very dark.  Only outdoor scenes a bit brighter.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Great acting and the most innovative filming technology (at that time), now with the new film Rush it allows you to compare the advances in video filming during the last 30 years in video recording technology.
0761172726|4.0|I order this calendar every year, but I do wish there was still a version that is just the classic, January - December.  I find myself putting things on this calendar through the end of the year,and then having to switch them over to the new one once I get it, since that starts in August.  It's great that it has the school year, but personally, I would like to have one that is January-December.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great calendar to keep track of everyone in the family--3 boys makes for a busy house and lots to keep track of. I will continue to use it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Good worldwide zombie twist. Like vampires, they just bite, not gobble you up, therefore less gory - thank you. I would have liked to see more imaginative scenes such as zombies in the subway, in swim suits at a beach, a martial arts school take them on with martial arts weapons, wall street run amok, real zombies chasing fake zombies on a movie set, zombies entering a movie theater showing a zombie movie, zombie football players chasing fans at a game, etc. NOW we're talking!
B00CISC2DA|4.0|A torched cool blue and orange sky, visions of silently pressed isolation, Boards of Canada dive deep in their new eerie and moody affair, Tomorrow's Harvest. The record opens up right where you want to be. Resident Advisor's Jordan Rothlein describes the opening &#34;...what John Carpenter might record if he took a job sound tracking a Michael Mann film.&#34; The record breaths and begins to live in your head. The sounds draw very cinematic feelings and create a visual world. 80's and 90's films come to mine. A certain retro sound that sounds very modern, or, rather a modern sound that leans deep into a retro-future cinematic world with a timeless addictive beauty that never loses its grace, depth and intrigue. Although this record is crafted with minimal sounds and quite ambient tracks that often don't run over 2 minutes, the sounds they use are very effective, tempered and orchestrated together smooth, easy and expertly.<br /><br />Boards of Canada, oddly enough are two Scottish producers who have been in the game of producing electronic music for quite some time. It is safe to say they are veterans in music producing. Their craft and expertise have shown through from the start to finish on this record and offers a bit of a challenge for the listeners. It takes some intent listening and a good set of headphones or speakers to really reach some of the texture and ambiance. One of my favorite records of the year, Sit back and enjoy this one as the perfect autumn soundtrack.<br /><br />-Justin Kniep
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I've used TWC app for a very long time and always find it to be up-to-date and fairly accurate. Unlike some reviews I've read, I find no &quot;increased battery drain&quot; on my kindle fire. I read roughly 5 hrs a day (up to 5 books a week) and STILL only have to plug my kindle in every other day. This app is great!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really liked the first two books but now it seems like they were pointless. I didn't feel like the things the characters did really made a difference. The ending and the whole book felt rushed, repetitive and just not thought out. Some people may like the ending and feel its more realistic but I like to read books to feel good, not be depressed.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Not credible. OK for gullible or impressionable minds. It seems like the movie is supposed to be based on realism in a distant future, not fantasy. Yet, how can a 90 pound kid physically handle the brutal force of a 1 ton monster, and defeat it \\"mano a mano\\" and this is just one example. Nice storyline and depiction of futuristic technology, however.
0452289963|5.0|What great insight this book provides as to the human mind. Understand your mind and remove the insanity from your life. Understand the mind of others and diffuse the insanity they create. This book should be standard reading for every parent, and oh my God... our politicians!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series, up until the end. It was a terrible, heartbreaking ending. Killing off the main character? Really? Couldn't you have just had Tris shot but survive? Knowing how it ends, I will not be seeing the movie.
B000MMMT46|5.0|Such a great album.  Both sides are packed with everything that made Flogging Molly a favorite for punk and Irish folk fans alike.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am a bit confused, seeing all this bad reviews here. I just finished the book, and I really liked it. I thought it was a good ending to the series, not so confusing as Insurgent, and I am still crying! I am sorry so many people were disapiontet, but I am not. To read parts of the story from Fours' POV was great, and I read that some people think that Tris and Foure had very litte differentiation between them, that it was sometimes easy to forget who was the one telling the story. I can see that, but I think they are alike, and it didn't bother me at all. I am happy with this book, and very very sad.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I passed on watching this when it was on TV but heard so many good things about it that I had to watch.<br />I love this show.  The writing is excellant and Jessica Lange is the best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very imaginative...and creative!! I must say very addictive! only wish it did not take 30 min to get more lives!
B003UCPE38|5.0|Nothing I can say that hasn't been said a million times by a million people regarding this album.  It's Great.
0694003611|5.0|Children love this book for whatever reason! My son absolutely LOVED it! I read it as soon as he showed interest in books and he just loved flipping through the pages and it was a bedtime favorite! He is almost two and whenever I read it, he walks to me and listens. There is also a video clip of this on youtube read by Susan Sarandon. A must have for your infant's book collection!
0307271080|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have not read other books by this author, but certainly look forward to doing so now.  This was a broadly told tale about a young man and woman struggling to keep their connection as they struggle with upheaval in their home country.  This ultimately takes them apart as Ifemelu leaves to gain an education in the US, whereas Obinze lives a more treacherous existence in London after not being able to join Ifemelu in the USA. The journey that they take separately, as well as their both ending back up in Nigeria was a journey of which I enjoyed each and every step.<br /><br />These characters and their lives are so well crafted and developed that I truly felt I was walking through their story.  That is an amazing testament to a story well told and well paced!

B000002UWL|5.0|For many fans, the Pet Shop Boys ARE electronic music. Before bands as disparate as the Orb, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, Portishead and Boards of Canada redefined the way electronic and techno music were made, Pet Shop Boys delivered heart and soul to what was considered \\"mechanical music\\". The singles they made in the 80s - \\"West End Girls\\", \\"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\\", \\"Suburbia\\", \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\", \\"Always in My Mind\\", \\"Domino Dancing\\" - are seminal pop singles of that period - cerebral, complex to the point of avant-garde, yet strongly melodic and emotionally heart-lifting.<br /><br />However, the 1980s were coming to an end and the 1990s were about to begin. At the time, no one was aware of it, but the musical climate was gradually changing - the rise of West Coast rap, the slow demise of 80s hard rock and glam metal, the increasing popularity of country music and, most of all, the ascendance of grunge, which would take full effect in 1991. In addition, many pop acts that sustained success in the 80s were about to be cast off and rejected - Duran Duran, George Michael, Paula Abdul, A Flock of Seagulls, INXS, even towering figures like Michael Jackson and Prince (although the latter made a comeback in early 2000s).<br /><br />Where does the PSB fit in to all of this? They neither fell out of obscurity or become giant superstars in America. They continued doing what many maverick artists like Steely Dan, Todd Rundgren and David Bowie have done - defy expectations and make the music they wanted. The outcome? \\"Behaviour\\", an intoxicating synth-pop album that forgoes much of the catchy, beat-driven music of the 80s for a more leisurely paced, seductive sound. Gone was the dance and in came introspection. As a result, a masterpiece was born.<br /><br />In these subtle but emotionally intense ten tracks, Pet Shop Boys delivered beautifully constructed pop that showed them improving their craft and embracing maturity. The album is bookend by two of the most emotionally charged tracks the PSB had done - the cascading \\"Being Boring\\" and the melancholic \\"Jealousy\\". In between are stunners such as the dark \\"This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave\\", the skeptical \\"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\\", the relaxing \\"To Face the Truth\\", the opulent \\"My October Symphony\\" and soulful \\"The End of the World\\". All these songs deal with romantic distress, disintegrating relationships and unrequited love.<br /><br />Excellent as the album tracks are, though, the best songs of \\"Behaviour\\" remain its four singles: The ironically titled opening track, \\"Being Boring\\", remains one of the best and best-loved songs of the PSB discography and for good reason: the wistful guitar riffs, moody synthesizers and simple but effective beats make for an alluring listen, heightened by Neil Tennant's dramatic lyrics about lives changing and perceptions becoming different. \\"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\\", one of the few songs that injects humor, satirizes a pop artist's vain attempts to be taken seriously. \\"So Hard\\", the album's first single and the only one closest to the dance-oriented music of the 1980s, addresses the futility of sexual affairs; and the majestic \\"Jealousy\\" is self-explanatory - infidelity, emotional indifference, envy, all presented with gorgeous keyboards by Chris Lowe and strings and a soulful lead performance by Tennant that turns a potentially schmaltzy ballad into a moving tale of genuine heartbreak.<br /><br />Despite being over 20 years old, \\"Behaviour\\" remains as fresh and relevant as it did back in 90, no mean feat in a genre where an older generation of electronic and pop music bands (Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Eurythimics, etc.) was about to be supplanted by the more cutting-edge bands of the 1990s like Massive Attack, the Chemical Brothers, Moby and DJ Shadow. That's because Lowe and Tennant were terrific songwriters that had a strong ear for melodies, a strong sense of musical craftsmanship and an intellect in telling stories without resorting to pop cliches or dated formulas. If there's one glaring flaw, it's that the singles are so strong that listeners will avoid the album tracks. But doing that would do \\"Behaviour\\" a giant disservice - it's a wholly terrific pop album from beginning to end and rivals \\"Actually\\" and \\"Very\\" as one of PSB's (and, by extension, electronic music's) crowning achievements. Don't hesitate to buy this, even if you don't care about electronic music.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy at all costs.ong sense of musical craftsmanship and an intellect in telling stories without resorting to pop cliches or dated formulas.

B005LAIIN0|4.0|Had a lot of expectations for this movie but it just kind of felt already done. Did not captivate. It was entertaining but I wished we had just rented it instead of buying it
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|First i really like the game.  What i don't like is when you get to the higher levels the moves slow down so that your time runs out quicker and then they try to sell you moves so you can continue playing.  Check it out next time you play.
B009LDCZDC|4.0|It is really good but part one was better. I am excited to see the next part when it comes out
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hope you make a 4th book (: I have really loved these books. Couldn't stop reading them and I am so intrigued with the character of Christian Grey
