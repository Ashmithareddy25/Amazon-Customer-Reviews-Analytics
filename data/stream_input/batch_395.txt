0385504209|5.0|&quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; has created quite a bit of fanfare within the reading community of this nation.  Everyone is talking about it, everyone has read it or is reading it and practically everyone is urging others to read it.  On that note, any avid reader will naturally raise an eyebrow and question whether any book can possible be that good.  To this end, I must honestly report that Dan Brown's book is actually better than expected.<br />In a nutshell, this book is a thriller.  The reader will be entertained from beginning to end.  Brown has authored a masterpiece...it is polished...and has no weaknesses.  Consequently, I urge any business person who is taking a long trip and will spend many hours in airports and flying...to pick up this book.  I don't think its fair to share the plot with you.  I don't want to spoil the fun.  Of all the books I have reviewed for Amazon to date...&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is by far the most entertaining.  Highly recommended.<br />Bert Ruiz
B00005JLR8|5.0|I have never felt such an affinity for a movie.  Like the main characters, my wife and I also lost a child.   After seeing it for the first time, I was speechless for three days.  The father's face was mine, the mother's words were my wife's, and the family roles of the daughters were the same as mine.  Overlook the minor flaws and you will see emotional emptiness combined with timid hope.  A must see if you want to see into the hearts of those who have similarly mourned.
0385336810|5.0|Being a fan of the Shopaholic series, the day Can You Keep a Secret? came out, I had already rushed to the bookstores.<br />After reading it, I knew that my year of waiting had paid off. Emma Corrigan has the same fantastic personality as Rebecca Bloomwood [from Shopaholic], and her hilarious antics are garenteed to be laugh-out-loud [and I know from personal experiences]. Even though I still prefer the Shopaholic series, I still believe that this novel is something you don't want to miss out on reading.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I can't say anything really bad about this film, but I can say I was certainly expecting to be more impressed after hearing and reading all the hype surrounding it!  Huh?  Did I miss something?!  I mean it was very well acted and I do love both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen, yet, this movie left me feeling very unfulfilled.  Perhaps I was let down due to all the hype, and that of course has everything to do with who the director is and hollywood politics, and nothing to do with the quality of the film itself.  Not a bad movie, just not nearly as good as I expected.  I anticipated being blown away, I was not, to say the least!  If this type of movie is one that appeals to your taste, I won't say don't see it, I suspect you won't hate this movie, but I'll bet you've seen better!
0671891634|5.0|Another good book from Peter Lynch. I can't remember what exactly is the best part. But it fills the gaps in the first book (One up on the Wall Street) and make you understand more about his investment process. Lots of details that are worthy of noting, given Peter Lynch beat the index and almost all his peers in his days as fund manager of Magellan Fund.<br />Equally funny. A good laught. I bet John Rothchild, the ex-journalist is the person who should take the credit.
B000089CJI|5.0|A friend turned me onto the Postal Service, and at first I was skeptical.  She had described them as techno emo, and frankly that scared me.  But when I listened to the CD, I was pleasantly surprised with the catchy beats and use of synth.  The harmony of the two vocalists (as in &quot;Nothing Better&quot;)  heightens the sound and gives their music an overall plesant quality.  If you are a fan of such 80s new wave favorites such as Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, and OMD, as I am, you'll thoroughly enjoy this record.  Also, fans of Ben Gibbard's other band, Death Cab for Cutie will also like this record even though it sounds very different from DCFC's stuff.  <br />The personal favorites on this album are &quot;The District Sleeps Alone tonight&quot; (I cannot get the first line out of my head: Smeared black ink, your palms are sweaty and I'm barely listening), &quot;Such Great Heights,&quot; &quot;Nothing Better,&quot; and &quot;Clark Gable.&quot;  All of the songs on the album are completely listenable though.  <br />The sound of the postal service is fresh and belongs in its own category.  Definitely get this album and give it a listen--it's excellent.
B000000OAC|5.0|A lot of Queen fans gave up on Queen when then turned (so called) commercial with News of the world in 1977. Queen have fans who are not ready to listen albums released after 'A day at the races'. However I found News of the World a very important and one of the best in their career.<br />It does matter that it had one of rare double A sides in form of We will Rock You and We are the Champions, but what matters more is they are ability to experiment &amp; explore different forms and moods of music all at the same album. Let's go track by track.<br />We Will Rock You - We all know it is one of the most heard stadium anthems. People who does not even know about a band named 'Queen' has heard this song a few 100 times. (Generally sung before the game). Belong to the category Stadium rock!!!<br />We Are The Champions - Same as above. (Generally sung after winning the game). Belong to the category Stadium rock!!!<br />Sheer Heart Attack -  A mix of Punk &amp; hard rock. I like that eletronic sounding percussion. This song rocks the hell out.<BR>  <BR>All Dead, All Dead - A pop sounding ballad kind of thing! A bit difficult to categorize, but it is a great song. Great vocals.<BR>  <BR>Spread Your Wings - Power ballad. Good guitar solo at the end and great vocals as usual. <BR> <BR>Fight From The Inside - Punk sonding hard rock again. Good use of echo with Freddie's vocal.<BR>       <BR>Get Down, Make Love - Only week song according the me in this album. Lyrics is Dirrtier than Christina. Tune is a little boring.<BR>       <BR>Sleeping On The Sidewalk - Vocals by Bryan. 50's-60's rock n' roll. Simple &amp; sweet structure.<BR>        <BR>Who Needs You - Second best song in the album (written by John). A fun song with a lot of acoustic guitar. Very different pop sounding song by this great group. <BR>       <BR>It's Late - This is a super rock song about love with a progressive touch. Bryan divides the song in 3 scenes. Best song of the album.       <br />My Melancholy Blues - A very melancholic song. Freddie excels again. Depressing way to the album but the song itself is very good.<br />Final Verdict: Great album. Queen incorporates a lots of different styles into a single album. 5 starts all the way. I also feel it is a good place to start listening to them. Buy it.
B000069HK2|2.0|So, Bert vomits on stage and while listening to this album I vomit a little inside my mouth. And that my friends is about all I have in common with this album. But, here's the review!<BR>I'm giving it a strong two stars for the two songs they got right. Which are Maybe Memories and Box of Sharp Objects. Otherwise this album is one terrible song fallowed by another. <BR>Here's one for you, Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence... GlassJAw was here five years ago.
0671027344|5.0|This is an awesome book, there almost are no words to describe it, like another rater, I felt 'stunned' after I read it.  Charlie is a wallflower meaning that most of the time he goes along with what people he cares about say, and do, but he has a lot of passion.  It almost seemed unbelievable that a character who is so emotionally volitale and so innocent and optimistic could exist because of his past circumstances.  This book is tear-jerking at times, but it is also optimistic and very hopeful.  I think in the end Charlie learns to accept himself and to realize what a special person he is, and also to &quot;participate&quot; with passion.  It is a wonderful read for anyone who has been or will be going to high school, and it is easy to read and inspiring.  READ IT!!!!!!!!
B000002L99|4.0|This album and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge are the best Van Hagar CD's.  The tracks were good except for the last one.  <br />Good Enough-Good start for Van Hagar.  The band sounds like it has been reinvented here.<br />Why Can't this be Love?-Good song, even though it is a saccarine love song.  THe Keyboard work was quite interesting.<br />Get Up-Easily the hardest song on the album.  Sammy really hit the high notes here. Good song to listen to when you want to get pumped up.<br />Dreams-The best song on the album.  The song is very keyboard driven but has a very lush feel. It also moves fast and deals with people aspiring to be more than they are.<br />Summer Nights-A fun party song.  It was a carefree song about meeting women and having a good time with the guys.<br />Best of Both Worlds-A good track about enjoying your life while you can.<br />Love Walks In-I thought this song sounded very progressive and I quite enjoyed it despite it being a saccharine love ballad.<br />5150-Really good track, mainly dealing with the woes of winning a woman.  It has a really great guitar riff opening as well as a good solo.<br />Inside-I hate this track.  While the rest of the albu is pretty good, I can't stand this song.  I always stop my CD after the 8th track so I don't have to listen to this horrible song.<br />Overall, a good album.  THough, I thought that the sound was wierd.  It had a very compressed feel.
B00006CXXU|1.0|Three adjectives that describe Christina Aguilera's album &quot;Stripped&quot; to a tee.  What she was touting as some kind of masterpiece turns out to be a trainwreck of glossy bubblegum, attempts at rock songs that come off contrived and corny, and misguided attempts at urban music.  Notice how she needs to invite several guests to give the songs an edge.  It's like Michael Bolton trying to put on a gangsta pose - not convincing at all.<br />As far as &quot;Dirrty&quot; (man, I hate misspelling) is concerned, it's  bunch of cliched phrases strung together with an incredibly cheesy vocal performance - Christina tries to come off as tough but falls flat on her face.  We also get the incredibly vain and overwrought &quot;Beautiful&quot;; case in point: the line &quot;I am beautiful in every single way&quot;.  Supposedly this is a song about inner beauty, but it loses all of its meaning coming from someone like Christina Aguilera who clearly tries to emphasize outer beauty - this is like Zsa Zsa Gabor writing a book on how to have a lasting marriage.<br />You also have &quot;The Voice Within&quot; (Whitney Houston, if you've heard this song, you should call your lawyers), and the shallow &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot; - parents, this song should definitely discourage you from picking this up for your kids.  And then there's &quot;Fighter&quot;, where Aguilera attempts to prove that she has an edge - unfortunately, the finished product sounds like your typical overproduced pop with guitar thrown into the mix.  Let's not forget songs like &quot;I'm OK&quot; where Aguilera sings about her &quot;traumatic&quot; childhood.  Sure - Pink collaborated with Linda Perry a year earlier and sold millions addressing this topic in her songs, and now Aguilera is trying to mine the same territory.  A couple of years ago she was your typical stomach-flaunting bubblegum pop singer.  Now this, my friends, is marketing at its finest.  If techno-polka becomes a huge trend, we'll probablysee Aguilera hop aboard that bandwagon as well.<br />In summary: The media may promote the heck out of this and make it seem like an excellent album, but it's only going to set you up for disappointment.  Take a pass on this one.
B00005MKA3|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever and a must have for any BM&amp;TW fan! Lyrics are very deep, meaningful and beautiful, and the music is warm and mellow. &quot;So much trouble in the world&quot;, &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, &quot;Africa Unite&quot;, &quot;Survival&quot;, and \\"One drop&quot; are standouts, but each track is absolutely fabulous. The album is all about Africa, but I think anyone will find something very personal in the lyrics. I'm very eclectic when it comes to music, and I listen to various genres (alternative, rock, hard rock, reggae, progressive, trip-hop, gothic, blues, jazz), and this is one of my top 5 albums of all times!
B00005OM4N|1.0|This is Britney Spears's third CD, with an album title that it probably took her hours to come up with - Britney.  <br />She went around proclaiming that she had a bold statement to make with this album.  Well, I'll let the cat out of the bag for you - she's not a girl, not yet a woman.  Then what is she?  An alien sent down to conquer our species?  And in case one song wasn't enough, she repeatedly tells you that she's not a little girl.  Throughout EVERY song on the album.  And when she's not doing that, she's complaining about being held down and whining about people telling her what to do.  Wow - that's rather punk rock of her, is it not?<br />Britney, honey, listen to me: You are told what to do because you're a marionette, an industry creation.  I don't know if these are lyrics that you came up with, or if it was your producers to give you a pseudo-rebellious edge.  You haven't displayed one iota of creativity or originality on any of your albums.  If it wasn't for these people that tell you what to do, you would be working the deep fryer at a fast food joint.<br />The music on the album is the same dated synthetic pop that was worthless when Tiffany performed with it 13 years ago.  The Neptunes are brought in as producers on a few tracks, but that isn't enough to salvage poorly written and executed tracks like &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; - and on a related note, anyone who isn't Prince that spells &quot;for you&quot; as &quot;4 U&quot; is pretty much a walking joke.<br />In summary: Another weak effort from a performer whose 15 minutes should have ended 15 minutes ago.  Don't waste your time.
B000002H72|5.0|The Pixies defined alternative rock before it was hip the most experimental band 0f 80's early 90's. This album & Surfer Rosa inspired  & influenced a fresh faced young talented kid from Seattle at the time early 90's to write a little album called Nevermind maybe you heard of this,  Kurt Cobain. Seriously one of the most unique experimental albums. This is their best by far every track kicks. Debaser I play over & over again one of the  best tracks on CD such a catchy tune. You can't define Pixies sound its so original Black Francis (Frank Black)aka voice is melodic & rage at sametime if thats possible with Kim Deals melodic undertones. Debaser, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Bleed, Wave of Mutilation standout tunes & of course \\"Gouge Away\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time. Pick this album up its a must if you value real altern. music. One of my top 5 albums all time. Put it this way this album came out in 1989 and it still holds up todays sounds. Essential album to have in collection Doolittle's sound is unlike any other it truly beats to the sound of its own drum and left of center.

B0001JXQEM|5.0|Words cannot express how unbelievable awesome this release is! The remastered b-sides and kitchen tapes are incredible! Any and all true fans MUST get this package to experience the magic that is: the weez. Being a fan of the band since I was a little girl, hearing the Blue album again, along with the oher tracks included brought me back-- experience this for yourself, and you will definitely get your money's worth! =w=
0385510438|1.0|This was so boring. There was too much emphasis on secondary characters, not enough on the plot.  I was very disappointed.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I still remember the joy I had picking up the double album on it's release date in 1979 at Licorice Pizza Records in California.  I must admit that I was not ready for Lindsey's songs for a few years, but I fell in love with the Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks songs immediately.  I have learned to love Lindsey's contributions, probably now more than ever with this outstanding double CD remastered release.  It's good to know 25 years later that TUSK is at the top or near the top of so many 'best all time album' lists.  I have to say listening to this spectacular version, my favorites remain Brown Eyes (listen to the glorious alternate mix on disc 2 - previously released on The Chain), Sara (yes, the full length version), Storms, What Makes You Think You're The One, Sisters Of The Moon, Beautiful Child, Never Forget, Tusk, Think About Me (the sunniest song on this set and perhaps the one song that should have ended up later on Mirage), Angel and Walk A Thin Line...but there is not a bad song on this CD.  This CD is not for everybody, maybe not for the casual Fleetwood Mac fan, but certainly for anybody wanting to hear good rock and roll and something different.  As wonderful as Rumours was and is, this is the ultimate FM album for it's creativity, bravery and sheer abandonement of what is safe.  In the liner notes, author Parke Puterbaugh states that the album reached number 8 on the Billboard Top 200, however, the album reached number 4 and the title track single, Tusk, reached number 8 on the Hot 100 (that's how obsessed I have always been about this record, that's all from memory).  Besides the nice second disc of outtakes, demos and single versions, the new remastered Rumours is worth getting, the songs have never sounded better.  It's obvious that great care has been taken with both sets, the sound is much more separated than previous releases, dynamite.  Lastly, pick up a copy of the DVD-A of \\"Say You Will,\\" the best FM CD since Tusk.  At 18 songs, it's almostas many as the 20 on Tusk - sure Christine is gone and missed, but Lindsey and Stevie rise to the occasion and jump into this decade with a sound that it both yesterday and today.
B00008ADPF|5.0|This is by far the best nickleback album to date.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Thankfully one of their better known albums is now even better after remastering & with bonus tracks.    While most of my friends gives their opinion as \\"Aqualung\\" or \\"Thick as a brick\\" being Jethro Tull's best work. I will give my nod to this wonderful album called \\"Songs from the   wood\\". Like the name hints, this album is very much folk influenced. All the songs are good (and from the wood). The title track, Hunting girl, The whistler, Pibroch (Cup in hand), Fire at midnight are too good. Actually I should write name of all the songs. This album should have influenced a lot of artistes. I don't know whether it really had, but one thing I can write this is one of the best albums of all time. Anderson's flute never sounded so good. Tull never sounded so gentle and at the same time so creative. If you want to buy a Tull album (if not why are staring at this page) buy it. Then go for Aqualung, Crest of a knave and other amazing stuff.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is way down there with &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.&quot;  At least AKT knew it was stupid D movie and played that to the hilt.  Lost in Translation is just bad, bad, bad but it thinks it's a legitimate movie.  The Oooonly reason this script has ever seen the light of day is that it was directed by Ms. Coppola.  Her direction is OK, I guess, but most of the sceens are so lame, it is virtually impossible to rate the director.  Ditto with Bill Murray except he is the sole saving grace of this film.<br />Now I know Ms. Coppola also wrote it.  Were I she, I would not have advertised this too loudly because this is where the fault of this film CLEARY lies.  Everything the writer is responsible for in a movie (dialogue, sceen transition, whether the movie makes sense) SUCKS!  If anybody else wrote this movie, it would never have been financed and, if by some fluke it were, they would have been run out of Hollywood on a rail.  Ms. Coppola, of course, has a promising DIRECTING career because of her name but I believe that this movie has eliminated any possibility of her working as a writer (even in Hollywood, a name will only get you so far).<br />OK, if I have not been clear enough, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this film.  If you must watch it, rent it -- I assure you (even if you are the biggest Bill Murray fan who ever lived), you will NEVER want to watch the movie a second time.  (In fact, I challenge anyone to stay awake and actually make it through one showing.)
0393317552|5.0|There are hundreds of reviews on here of this monumental book covering the general thesis and finer details.  Suffice to say that the book is extremely powerful and thought provoking.  Whether or not one agrees with Diamond's conclusions, they are well-established and inspire critical thought.  He has presented some of the simplest answers to questions of monumental historical significance, and the scientific presumption should always be that the simplest answer is most likely correct.  While some reviewers slam Diamond as psuedo-Marxist and completely unbalanced, no competing theories of human development are as compelling as his nor as scientifically substantiated to this point.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|The critically bashed film known as &quot;Gothika&quot; isn't a bad movie,even though the minute Halle Berry says &quot;I know the murder had something to do with the girls ghost&quot; it's pretty obvious what's going on.But...it's happening.People are managing to write good horror films again and this is one of them.Berrys stars as Miranda Grey,a psychiatrist working at a mental institution is driving home when she sees a girl standing in the middle of the road.She investigates but the girl suddenly bursts into flames and Miranda wakes up in the same mental institution she works in and she has supposedly killed her husband.But when the ghosts begins to mess with her,she befriends one of her patients named Chloe (Penelope Cruz) who believes Satan comes into her cell and rapes her.The movie is fastpaced,never boring really,there are surprises and stuff that is supposed to be surprsing,the film also stars Secret Window's Charles S.Dutton as<BR>Miranda's dead husband Doug and Robert Downey Jr. as the doctor treating her.B for the movie.Enjoy.
0385510438|4.0|I look forward to John Grisham's books because they have a plot that keeps you interested. I worked in a law office many years and like his descriptions of law procedures. I've read all his books. Some are better than others but I'm glad I read this one. I read it in two days because I had to find out what would happen.
B00009V7T2|2.0|At The Drive In was a band that was poised for greatness, yet they imploded before they were able to go that far.  They splintered off into a few projects, most notably Sparta and The Mars Volta.  While the former band scales back the ATDI sound and tones down the eccentricities, Mars Volta is all over the place - nothing is too pretentious, too extreme, too over the top for these guys.  Some will find the grandiosity of this album to be somewhat off-putting, as did I.  The reasons (given by Omar Rodriguez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala) that led to the demise of ATDI don't seem to hold much water - they were quoted as saying something to the effect of &quot;ATDI appealed to testosterone-driven men and we didn't want to be a part of that scene&quot;.  Both bands are good, but unfortunately clearly are the sum of their parts.<br />Whether you like this album or not will depend squarely on how you feel about prog-rock.  I think that this genre, in skilled hands and executed properly, can be quite engaging (i.e. Tool).  But this album has a &quot;throw it to the wall and see if it sticks&quot; feel to it - the ambitions are good-intentioned but the band just doesn't have the determination or the continuity to make it work in the finished product: their reach exceeds their grasp.  I think that if the band wasn't too willing to let the past go and if they incorporated more of their previous band's angst and aggression, and if they spent more time recording this album, it could have been a more consistent and rewarding listen.  But that was not to be.<br />In summary: Not a bad album, but by no means worthy of all the praise that has been foisted upon it.  This album only shows potential of what the band is capable of.  It also makes you mourn the loss of ATDI knowing that they definitely were capable of putting out a masterpiece.
0553579908|4.0|This is certainly a well made book, the characters and the action are great. It all moves together quickly, never having the characters rest in one castle for too long. Thankfully it has expelled some of the brain damage caused by the Wheel of Time series (Jordan is a money grubbing banjo-hitter.) The problems; sometimes you want the Lannisters(generally more bad than good) to win, or you want the Starks (more good than bad) to win. ... Winter is coming.
B000060P79|1.0|I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard someone proclaiming Simple Plan as their &quot;favorite punk rock band&quot;.  That's just flat out hilarious.  These guys are about as punk rock as Barbra Streisand.<br />A brief history of punk rock: This genre of music initially stood for going against the establishment, going against the grain and doing things your own way, and expressing beliefs that go against conventional thought.  The best bands in the genre did at least one of these.  Simple Plan does none.<br />Punk rock has more to do with image than sound for these hacks: Spiked hair, pointed bracelets, and &quot;wild&quot; behavior in their music videos - by wild I mean running around causing a rampage at a shopping mall by knocking over displays.<br />Let's take a look at the music: &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; is an absolute embarrassment coming from people that are in their late 20's like Simple Plan (sample lyrics: &quot;I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare / I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair&quot;).  Other mature subject matter includes a song about a girlfriend that's an alien (&quot;My Alien&quot;), a song about a disapproving father (&quot;Perfect&quot;) and a song that perfectly sums up their credo, where they also name check several pseudo-punk bands (&quot;Grow Up&quot;).  There's also several other corny songs about puppy love on this album, and musically it sounds just like Sum 41 / Blink 182 / Good Charlotte, only somehow even more generic and commercial.<br />In summary: If you are looking for an actual punk rock album, steer clear of this one.  But if you are looking for something that could be described as &quot;NSYNC with an attitude&quot;, then this might just be your idea of musical euphoria.
B000006NUW|3.0|Boy, what a disappointment!<br />Every single one of these 104 songs are presented in their original mono sound, just as they were all those years ago. However, nowhere on the package does it mention this important fact.<br />This would normally be a 5 STAR box, but because of the unadvertised mono sound, I give it only 3 stars!<br />A little dishonesty there, Motown.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Sarah McLachlan is one of the most acclaimed musical artists out there today, which made me anxious to find out what she was all about.  Sadly, the hype was all empty, and this CD is very ordinary.  I like to draw comparisons between music to food - what I typically listen to reminds me of some interesting Mexican combo platter...while this reminds me of grits.<br />Sarah McLachlan's voice is relatively unimpressive - it comes off as atonal and breathy much of the time.  As far as the arrangements and musical performances are concerned - they're so flat they will put you to sleep in no time.  The lyrics are perhaps the album's one semi-strong point - the writing is solid for this genre and enough to raise the rating 1 star, but the music itself is about as exciting as watching paint dry.  The extremely corny ballad &quot;Fallen&quot; is the kind of song that you'll surely turn down the volume if someone walks up.  I also have to take the production to task - the sound is too polished and there's just too many strings in the mix that it gets to the point where everything becomes a blur.  For that reason, it seems that Sarah McLachlan could be barely competent on the piano and she doesn't get the opportunity to truly shine.<br />There's an awful lot of ink spilled on Sarah McLachlan, and despite the press touting her as some kind of &quot;bold and innovative&quot; artist, this release is ultimately quite similar in sound and vision to Celine Dion - custom made for your local &quot;listen at work&quot; station. The tepid arrangements and overwrought song structures only strengthen the Celine comparisons. <br />That said, if you like Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, or what is typically played on adult contemporary stations, you'll definitely enjoy Sarah.  But if you're looking for something that is truly unique and groundbreaking, look elsewhere.
0688163173|5.0|This had to be one of the best suspense novels I have ever read. Maybe even the best book I have ever read.  I agree with another reviewer, you need to find someone who has already read this book so you can talk about it after you are finished.
B000053GTK|5.0|Gentle Giant's fifth album, 1973's &quot;In A Glass House,&quot; had a little bit of difficulty upon it's original release. CBS Records, who had released GG's previous two albums in the States, &quot;Three Friends&quot; and &quot;Octopus,&quot; apparently didn't care very much for the band's latest offering, and they passed on it. So, for the longest time, U.S. fans of Gentle Giant could only get &quot;In A Glass House&quot; as an import. Thankfully, though, with the dawn of the compact disc, this problem has since been rectified. Listening to this obscure GG album, I can only speculate that the brass at CBS must've been totally deaf at the time, because &quot;In A Glass House&quot; is easily one of the band's very best releases. The album's bookend tracks, &quot;The Runaway&quot; (kicking off with the sound of breaking glass) and the title track (which concludes with the same sound of breaking glass) are two of the band's very best pieces---great, quirky, uncompromising prog rock. &quot;An Immate's Lullaby&quot; and &quot;A Reunion&quot; are both haunting and beautiful, and &quot;Way Of Life&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot; are both solid Gentle Giant rockers. The band's precision and performances are amazing, the vocals are very strong, and the album's production is top-notch. A terrific prog rock album straight across the board, &quot;In A Glass House&quot; is a definitive Gentle Giant gem.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This Cd is full of such great music and lyrics. I loved Dirrty and Fighter, they are the reasons I bought the Cd. After listening to the entire Cd I found so many other great songs. She is talented. Although people may not appreciate Christina's attitude or clothing choices, the girls got some pipes! Anyone who claims she can't sing or the album isn't good needs to listen to all the other pop stars out there........Christina has them all beat. I attended her concert in Philly and she sounded as good in concert. To top it off, she writes her own music and dosen't use machines to enhance her voice. One of the best albums as a whole that I have bought in a long time!!!!!!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|Yea, in my review of this album i said i hated roulette, but i love it now! keep up the good work guys!
B0000C1733|3.0|Chances are, if you've had any exposure to popular music he past 10 years, then you know what you're getting with this album. But this isn't really a greatest hits album. &quot;Parallel Universe,&quot; &quot;Universally Speaking,&quot; and &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; were never really hits. And huge songs for the band like &quot;Fire,&quot; &quot;Aeroplane,&quot; &quot;I Could Have Lied,&quot; and argueably &quot;Right on Time&quot; (I mean come on, it's not even 2 minutes long) are nowhere to be found. <br />However, that is only my opinion. The fact is that we're looking at a band who revolutionized the rock/rap genre and are presented with pretty much a collection of low-key ballads (save the few they couldn't ignore i.e. &quot;Suck My Kiss,&quot; &quot;Give it Away,&quot; and &quot;Higher Ground&quot;), lending to my suspicion that this is more of a record company moneymaker than a band presenting the highlights of its career. Either that or a John Frusciante ego trip. So, since they already have &quot;What Hits?!&quot; that takes care of everything pre-&quot;Mother's Milk,&quot; I say a more appropriate title for this album would probably be &quot;The Softer Side of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; But, nevertheless there are many great staple songs on here, and that at least warrents a generous 3 stars. I'm not buying it, but if you like the mellowed out Chili Peppers the best then you probably should.
0783229526|5.0|How could anyone not love this artistic display inside the mind of hunter s. thompson? I think that their are two kinds of people that enjoy this film, an immature druggie who doesn't understand the value of the 1960s and 1970s, and a deeper more sophisticated audience who can really understand the plot and make something of it. If you do not ponder about this movie, nothing will come of it. I have seen many films, even though I am only 15, but this one is very memorable to me and I adore it.
078322687X|3.0|The breakfast club is without doubt the biggest mixed bag of a film that i have ever seen. Its good in the way that its the most 80's film that you'll ever see, and its bad in the way that it's the most 80's film that you'll ever see. In other words its good in places but cheesy as tangy cheesy cheese in others.<BR>The story itself to me is pretty ludicrous, five kids get detention and then over the course of the film become close freinds after they express their deepest emotions to each other. Now maybe im just too much of a cynic but i can honestly say that in all the times that i was in detention i didnt want to talk to anyone. <BR>The acting is also really bad yet good in its own 80's way. The performances from Judd Nelson and the Teacher guy are so over the top that these guys cant even see planet earth anymore,and thats not me being sarcastic thats me being truthful, I apologise to all the people who hold John Bender close to their soul, its just my opinion, I am a rudos luchadore after all.<BR>The only real grudge that i have with this film is the soundtrack, I apologise again but that Simple Minds song makes me want to chainsaw my own face off. <BR>But I can see past that and appreciate what is a quite enjoyable film, just dont expect an experience that films like Kill Bill, LotR, Night of the living dead, and True Romance will give you just expect a good way to waste a few hours.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|This is a terrible horror movie in which characters must behave like idiots in order for the plot to work. How could Berry waste her new Oscar winner status in this crap?
0688163173|3.0|I'm amazed by both the positive and negative reviews.  Shutter Island will NOT stay with you long after you read it, it is NOT a classic, but at the same time the ending is NOT as confusing as some have indicated.<br />The premise is compelling, and while the writing is very good in places it is often annoying in other places.  For example, I have no problem with profanity as long as it is used in proper context, but Lehane is obviously infatuated with the 'F' word.  It's overuse in this book is contrived and forced into awkward sentences.  I know the word was around in 1954, but the way it's used here seems too modern and serves as a distraction.  Also, I've noticed in other books by this author that he has seemingly intelligent characters take a page of dialogue to understand something that is perfectly clear to the reader (like Whitey in \\"Mystic River\\", who doesn't catch an obvious revelation<br />until it's explained by another cop).<br />I've read three other Lehane novels and find him to be somewhat overrated.  They all feature characters who act and speak too much like one another, and extended deviations from the plot that inspire much skimming.  However, I would recommend this to those who like the page turning/Dan Brown type novels.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|The best kind of tongue-in-cheek sleazy rock, with a cover of Stuck in the Middle to top it off. Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme shows his drum talents, and his talented freinds.
B00005JLT5|4.0|Summary: Famed Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) struggles to survive the onslaught of Nazi tyranny during World War II in this autobiographical film. Already lauded at the time for his talents as a musician, Szpilman spent those years holed up in Warsaw, subsisting on scraps of food and barely able to stay alive. Grace comes in the form of a second chance -- at music, at freedom, at life. <br />My comments: Everyone knows by now that Mr. Brody won an Oscar for his starring role. I think it was well deserved...it was rumored Adrian actually got rid of his apartment, sold his car, and didn't watch television, in order to prepare for the role. And he dropped around 30 pounds as well. This movie is about the Holocaust, BUT it takes a different approach than most Holocaust films... It's a little slow at times, but the movie will stir up some emotions. There are very violent & sad images in the film, and I almost cried during some parts. The fact that this was based on a TRUE story makes it even more amazing...watch out for Thomas Kretschmann, the actor who played the Nazi Captain who helped Szpilman while he was in hiding...the few scenes between those two were the most surprisingly beautiful, & emotional parts of the whole movie. <BR>THE SOUNDTRACK WAS LOVELY: the piano playing was amazingly splendid.<BR>Overall, excellent film about history, music, love, loss, and the will to live...the way Adrien Brody portrayed different emotions on screen, you forget he is acting. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida came to my life at the age of 12 and I became  her admirer #1. Although there is more details to Frida's life, this movie followed an excellent biographer's book, Hayden Herrera. Frida just became known to whom she was unknown through this movie but she is, has been, and will be the most valuable icon  that Mxico has. Hayek knew that making this movie would be the passport to her success and especially have the support of her country, Mexico. I am finally proud of Salma, and believe me, her performance in this movie was fabulous,nothing like the soap operas she did (remember &quot;Teresa&quot; :() ). Read the book!!!
B00005B4GU|4.0|I'll start this review off by saying that no, this is not the best Radiohead album out there.  If you're just getting into them, this is not the record to get.  That award goes to OK Computer.  This may not be the best Radiohead album, but if it were any other band this record would be the highlight of their career.<br />Amnesiac was recorded in the same sessions as Kid A, but is hardly an album of Kid A b-sides;  the band recorded the material and put it together to fill two albums, and several b-sides, they didn't just record one album and slapdash the other tracks together to fill an album, as some might think.  Amnesiac's flow is deliberately disjointed and bipolar.  But here's a song-by-song breakdown, if you really want to know:<br />1. PACKT LIKE SARDINES IN A CRUSHD TIN BOX [9.5/10] - I love this tune.  Clanging percussion leads into a catchy bass riff that drives the song.  Thom Yorke's singing is subdued, occasionally transforming into electronic tones and back again.  Lyrically, it's not one of the bands strongest, but it's a great 'chill out' tune with a cool beat.<br />2. PYRAMID SONG [10/10] - I don't normally give 10's, but this track is truly a great track.  A piano ballad wouldn't be a recommended choice to help lead off the CD with, but the soaring strings and Thom Yorke's haunting vocals elevate this track to a level of greatness.  The video (not included on the disc, but if you want to seek it out) really adds a lot to it as well; but it's about as uncommercial as you can get.  Could you believe that this was the first single off the album?<br />3. PULK/PULL REVOLVING DOORS  [6/10] - Ugh.  You will hear many Radiohead fans tearing apart this track, but it's really not that bad.  It just doesn't leave an impression.  The last, haunting note of 'Pyramid Song' segues into this song, and with this songs abrupt, pulsing fuzz bass, it is kind of a jarring transition.  The aforementiond last note of Pyramid Song is also sampled repeatedly throughout this track, which could only really be described as an instrumental, as the vocals are so electronically modified and sparse, one could only describe it as 'Fitter Happier' from OK Computer on Acid.<br />4. YOU AND WHOSE ARMY? - [8/10]  Another great track.  Thom Yorke sings in a nasal tone throughout this whole 3-minute song, which with its slow, dark piano explodes at the end into a great climax.  Short and Sweet.<br />5.  I MIGHT BE WRONG - [10/10]  A classic.  The immediately recognizeable guitar riff persists throughout the song, and Thom Yorke's vocals are hauntingly beautiful.  The electronic cracks in the background really add together to make a stunningly 'cool' song, before it implodes on itself towards the end.  Seek out the live version on I Might be Wrong Live Recordings, as this song is completely transformed live into some sort of rock anthem.<br />6. KNIVES OUT - [7/10]  This is an OK song, I guess.  The guitars are cool and all, but the lyrics are kind of crap.  Depends on tastes, I guess.  I don't mind a good acoustic song, but the lyrics detract from it quite a lot.  Not that Thom isn't doing great vocal work, however.  Background music.<br />7. MORNING BELL/AMNESIAC - [5/10]  The Kid A version is so much better, but I guess it all comes down to preference.  This version is much more abrupt and less melodic than the Kid A version.<br />8. DOLLARS AND CENTS - [8/10]  This song is the quintessential track on Amnesiac, as I feel that it encapsulates the mood of the album perfectly, with its stops and starts and a catchy bass riff.  The Lyrics fade in and out of distinction, and the actual lyrics to this song is anybody's guess.  Great track overall with some good guitar work near the end.  Again, seek out the live version, also on IMBW.  Although not as changed, it is still very good.<br />9. HUNTING BEARS - [4/10] Why is this on here?  A short 2-minute song of almost random guitar pickings, it doesn't segue into the next song nearly as well as it mighthave.  Oh well.<br />10.  LIKE SPINNING PLATES - [10/10]  The last classic on Amnesiac.  This song exists in two forms:  This, scratchy, heavily electronic and dark version, and the heartbreakingly lovely live piano ballad version.  Get both.  This track is stunningly beautiful and atmospheric.  Give it time to grow on you.<br />11.  LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE - [8.5/10]  New Orleans jazz band, anyone?  This track is the antithesis of 'The National Anthem' on Kid A, where that track provided seemingly unscripted blasts of trumpet noise, this track provides a slow, marching melody that explodes towards the end in a tumult, combining with Thom's tortured vocals into a whirlwind of sound.  This track provides a fitting close for the album.<br />Overall a good album, but know what you're getting into.  This album could go either way - permanent CD player time or permanent shelf time.  I recommend it wholeheartedly, although if you are looking to purchase your first Radiohead album, I suggest getting OK Computer first, but if you're looking for a heavily atmospheric experience, you can do no better than Amnesiac.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|After seeing these guys live I am further convinced that this is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It has it all, from all out rock tracks to slow ballads that blow you away. Everyone owes it to themselves to pick up this disc.  You will swear you are listening to the Beatles when you hear 'Look What you've done'. Stop reading and go get this album now.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 emerged onto the college scene in 1999 as Kara's Flowers.  After their first release on Reprise Records, (The Fourth World), they were dropped by the label.  They subsequently fine-tuned their unique sound and were signed by Octone Records (an indie division of J-Records/Clive Davis) in 2002. That same year, Songs About Jane was released.  It is a worthy project from a group of talented artists that defies categorization fusing a mixture of genres into a finely tuned work of modern art.  The now platinum status of this CD is evidence of the group's hard work and burgeoning mass appeal.  Stand out tracks are the 2003 hit Harder to Breathe and the current top ten hit This Love.  She Will Be Loved is a slower yet just as appealing mellow tune that adds to the diversity of this disc.  Tangled and The Sun will help you get your funk on while Sunday Morning is a fun, hip tune that will have you singing along.  The key to this CD's success is the diversity of musical styles.  It never leaves one with a bland feeling, constantly surprising the listener with a mixture of Rock, Soul, Funk and R&amp;B.  A musical delight from beginning to end, Maroon 5 should have a bright future.
B000002J09|5.0|What an excellent album. Led Zeppelin's untitled album has the quintessential elements of their first three albums that came before, fused into what could be their masterpiece. Blues, hard rock, and folk sounds are all present on this album and charged to the utmost degree. Of course, alot of people cite this album as their best when they do not know much more beyond the stairway to heaven, but one cannot go wrong with this album, it is truly great. All band members have their own moments on the assortment of various styled songs. And what a great tracklist it has! Black dog, rock n'roll, stairway to heaven, going to california, when the levee breaks. As if one doesn't hear those enough on a local classic rock radio station. Sweet cucumber salad! Nevertheless, any record collection is incomplete without this. Truly, a must have.
B000063DHL|4.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. The only problem is that some songs (The loneliness, sea of madness, deja vu) are sub-par compared to the other masterpieces such as wasted years or somewhere in time. Some maiden fans claim that this album was their best, and some say that this was the beginning of downhill, IMO Powerslave and Somewhere in time marked their peak, both albums are very different but both are maiden at their peak.
B000002J09|1.0|How ironic that one of the all time greatest rock album's of all time should go untitled. However it is indeed hard to find words adequate enough to praise this cd. It could be considered almost a greatest hits album in itself. As varied as the tracks are they are all increidible songs. While some of the tracks are vintage heavy metal, that assault the ears with fantastic and powerful rythms. But at the same time delicate  songs such as stairway to heaven, and going to california, however one thing remains common throughout the all the songs. The musianship and vocals are superb on all the tracks. If you are looking to purchase a first led zeppelin cd, or looking to recommend one to a newcomer make it this one.
B00009RAJI|5.0|I have been wondering when they might get around to remastering the Fleetwood Mac catalog, particularly after hearing the criminal butchery inflicted upon the Tusk CD, my personal favorite. Oddly Enough, I have been listening to the new Mac album and was inspired to pick up Rumours, so I happened to discover this remaster by accident. I have to generally agree with the other reviewer in that the bonus material is interesting, if inessential. Also, the liner notes inside the cd booklet could have been much, much more comprehensive for such a landmark album. They decided to stick 'Silver Springs' back into the original sequence (directly between what used to be sides one and two of the LP, I do believe), but there is nary a mention as to why it was left off of the orignal LP or why the decision was made to put it back. Music geeks live for this kind of information! They did, at least, restore the original gatefold collage of photos that seem to show the band having a pretty great time, despite all the emotional pain they were apparently inflicting upon each other. <br />Still and all, the reason to pick up this album is the sound. The  drum and bass are filled out considerably and brought forward in the mix, the keyboards and vocal harmonies are given space to breathe and the guitar parts shimmer and shine like never before. In fact, for a Lindsey Buckingham fan like myself, this is a real treat to hear the intricate picking of this underrated Guitar Hero with such clarity. As a long time music fan, it is a tremendous treat to see the digital age finally catching up with the Monsters of Classic Rock &amp; Pop. Rumours is as good as it gets. Now I need to go buy Tusk!!!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Ah the 80's. Back when John Candy was alive and Tom Hanks did a string of comedies before he became all 'serious'. This is a great movie about a couple who buys an old 'fixer-upper' for a house and get in way, way over their heads. Everything needs to be redone (wiring, plumbing, etc.) and everything constantly falls apart.<br />Shelley Long is her usual cute self. I have to admit I've had a real soft spot for her ever since Cheers. So if you want an evening to remember your favorite decade, or a family night with the kids, 'The Money Pit' is right on the money.
B000022TSH|5.0|A great period piece about a struggle many desert areas have encountered over the years - who should get the water.  Many towns in CA, and Idaho, have gone through similar big-bucks struggles. Chinatown has aged wonderfully, like some fine piece of art deco.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Although I've heard of Slayer for years now, I only started getting into them last year. I'm glad I did, because they are one of the best (if not THE best) thrash bands of our time. As producer Rick Rubin says, Reign In Blood is the most powerful thrash record in history, and I would wholeheartedly agree. <BR>The album kicks off with the infamous &quot;Angel of Death&quot; - a masterpiece lasting about four minutes and is probably the song that Slayer will be forever known for (I can't wait to see them play it live at Ozzfest this summer). &quot;Piece By Piece&quot; and &quot;Necrophobic&quot; are obviously good as well, although not as extreme as the next track, &quot;Altar of Sacrifice&quot; - another favorite of mine because it has some of Kerry King's best guitar work. &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;...again, King is a genius, forcing powerful solos into the album's most disjointed song and making me want to listen to it again and again. The next few tracks are good but not as special. And then comes &quot;Postmortem&quot;, hands down my favorite track off of RiB. I literally had an obsession with that song for about a week, it was hard to listen to anything else. The guitars and Dave Lombardo's drums fit together so nicely (by the way, Lombardo is also in a band called Grip Inc., and he will reunite with Slayer this summer for Ozzfest). &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, another greatest hit, with some of the band's finest songwriting and classiest musicianship, and the most chaotic song on the album. I have the expanded edition with two bonus tracks, &quot;Aggressive Perfector&quot; and the &quot;Criminally Insane&quot; remix, both are great and should have made the original album. <br />Tom Araya's lyrics aren't the most complex, but this album came out in 1986, so they're still pretty good for their time. Warning, this band is NOT for hardcore Christians. Slayer has always been anti-religious, their lyrics talk about the evils of organized religion, and I doubt they believein God at all (though I don't necessarily think they're Satanists). <BR>This album is for metalheads, true metalheads only! If you're not a true metalhead, don't bother, go listen to Linkin Park and hang with your preppy friends, because Slayer does not want you.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is a movie where bogart's conscience (for our benefit joyfully) drives him to be as bad as possible.  The opposite of what made him cool in other movies, again makes him cool here.  The old-timer was also great - he knew how to be really happy.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Let me just say that you are WRONG WRONG WRONG.  First with you saying the daughter killed him is wrong.  Second this is by far NOT a  who done it.  This is a movie about suburban life with the beginning saying &quot;I will be dead in less than a year&quot;.  Nothing is reflected upon his death for a long time except for a saying that the daughter says but it turns out she was kidding.  It is truly sad that you'll miss one of the best movies ever because you THINK this is a who done it.  Read a review of the movie please for further information...
B00003CXUM|5.0|Simply put, it is one of the more ravishingly beautiful films ever made!  Every now and then, a director and his collaborators are so in-tune with each other, so opperating at the height of their powers, that as a viewer watching it, you are aware of watching greatness yet an air of disbelief pervades.  Such feelings you get with (to name a few flawless masterpieces) Tarkovsky's ANDREI RUBLEV, Bergman's CRIES &amp; WHISPERS, Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA, Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING, Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER, and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.  All of the aforementioned films are flawless works which use everything the cinema can do...such films are perfect;  IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is such a film.  It is a masterpiece and a must own!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|First off, if you're going to bother to review things on here, make them coherent.<br />This was by far the best mania in the last decade top to bottom (with the possible exception of 17).  Regardless of the fact that there weren't any 'big-name' acts performing (anyone cared about limp biscut or motorhead in the last 3 years...didn't think so), the production was quite nice, and the matches were a nice balance.  Of course Brock and Goldberg sucked, but anyone who follows wrestling seriously knew that would happen.  Eddy and Kurt was a wonderful display, with the correct person going over.  Raw's main event was HHH's best match involving someone other than just Michaels since his match with Flair on Raw almost a year ago.  The cruiser weights getting little time was dissapointing, but it makes sense given the long world title matches.  Taker's new outfit was kinda lame, but seeing Paulbearer again was great.  Overall, it's insane to give this event less than 4 stars, and it shows how far WWE has come since the debacle that was most of 2002-2003.
B000002WYT|1.0|There was a time when songwriting giants walked the earth.  I can count on one hand how many have inherited the true craft.  This guy is not one of them, contrary to the belief held by his musically-challenged following.  This type of lazy, uninspired &quot;songwriting&quot; will no doubt prove to be the end of Western civilization as it will fail to elevate the minds of men.
B000063147|4.0|My friend burnt me this cd from her collection, and the only song i had heard was a sllloooowww one, number 7. And I though ya know, it was so-so, but then once i listened to the rest, i was amazed....This is a truely hardcore/punk/metal album, this is wayyyyyyyyyy better in my opinion than their newest album. But the new one still kicks ass, A7X IS AWSOMe!
B000089RVX|4.0|I bought this album for the two more popular songs - My Immortal and Bring Me TO Life. I will preface by saying that I am not a huge Rock fan - Def Leppard and Creed is about my limit usually.<br />I'll be succinct: Amy has a set of pipes that put her in a select group. The album is a reflection of her voice, and without a doubt, she makes Evanescence what it is. She could become the lead singer of Creed, BNL or even No Doubt. <br />The only thing that this album does not do adequately is show her full range. This is dissapointing, but I think that it leaves room for another album.<br />I like almost all of the songs on this album. I grew up in the eighties, so I was pleasantly suprised at this.<br />Buy the album. I'd be cautious at their next offering, since they are a new band, but this is the real deal.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|No wonder Axl was trying to keep this CD from release.  Greatest Hits?  Out of 14 tracks there are 5 covers.  You're trying to tell me &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot; is included in their best work?  You want a GNR greatest hits CD?  Go buy Appetite for Destruction.  This is a waste of time and money.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This is my first Britney cd.  I wasn't extremely impressed, but overall it wasn't a horrible purchase.  Overall I'd say about half of the songs on the album are worth listening too.  The ones that weren't were just really really really bad!  No in between.  My advice for this cd is that it's worth listening too, ...
B00008H2LB|5.0|These guys get criticized for not being rock because they are popular and sell millions of records. These guys are an amazing band and put on an amazing show live. This CD is just as good as Hybrid Theory if not better. Some of the best songs on the CD are Faint, Breaking the Habit, and Hit the Floor. I recommend this album to everybody because these guys have endless talent and creativeness.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Evil Dead is the first, and in my opinion, the best in the Evil Dead series. While Dead By Dawn and Army of Darkness are very good movies, they were played more for the laughs and for showcasing Bruce Campbell's incredible acting skills than for the horror aspect. That's what makes this one stand out above them. Evil Dead is a horror movie, through and through. <BR>It starts out with a group of twenty-somethings on their way up to a cabin they rented recently. When they get to the cabin, Scott goes up to the cabin, where there is a porch swing banging incessantly against the cabin wall, though there is no noticable wind. After he gets the key and unlocks the door, it suddenly stops. This is a portent of things to come.<br />They start exploring the cabin, and soon they find the cellar, which has a room where they find a reel-to-reel audio player and a curious looking book. Of course, they play the tape and read from the book. That's when all hell breaks loose, if you'll pardon the pun. One of the gals, Cheryl, goes out in the woods when she hears a noise, where she is raped by the forest. This is one of the most memorable scenes in horror movie history. The demons that were released when they read from the Morturom Demonto possess her, and the rest of them lock her in the cellar.<br />It's not long before the rest of the group also gets possessed, all except Ash. He eventually kills all the possessed people, and day finally breaks. As he makes his way out the door and is on his way back home, the demons come rushing through the forest, through the cabin, and the last scene we see is Ash as he is confronted by them.<br />There are so many things I like about this movie. The action is pretty much non stop. All the action takes place in one night. We never get to see the demons, which was probably a cost issue, but it made them all the more terrifying. The acting by all the actors was excellent, especially Campbell. The special effects and the makeup for the possessedpeople were also excellent. And of course the story. If you haven't seen it, go rent it now. It's one of the best horror movies ever made. If you have seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it again.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Alright, I admit it. I am biased toward Linkin Park because they're one of my favorite bands (up there with Zeppelin, Incubus, and Pink Floyd).<br />Nevertheless, I think this album definitely ranks up there with the best albums of the year. I disagree with many fans who think ::every song:: is a hit, but anyway..<br />My ratings:<br />Foreword: Not really much to rate.. Sounds cool though :D<br />Don't Stay: More rock and Chester singing than most Meteora songs. Decent. 3/5<br />Somewhere I Belong: Infectious lyrics.. It gets almost as tiring as In The End after a while though. (Don't get me wrong, In The End is a great song.. it just gets tiring to listen to after ten thousand times.) 4/5<br />Lying From You: Basically the same old LP formula.. mostly rap verses with Chester adding the chorus. Nice raps by Mike. 4/5<br />Hit The Floor: A somewhat &quot;quiet&quot; song in parts, this features great rapping from Mike, and shows his talent without a loud background.. Pretty good. 3.5/5<br />Easier to Run: Reminds me a lot of Runaway.. Very basic Linkin Park formula. 3/5<br />Faint: The worst song on the CD, hands down. It really just does not live up to earlier Linkin Park works. However, it still is a great song to listen to.. Compared to other Linkin Park it's just not very good. 2/5<br />Figure 0.9: Mike puts down some serious rapping on this track, and Chester pushes his voice to the best of its abilities. 4/5<br />Breaking The Habit: Incredibly infectious rhythm and melody.. Also Chester actually shows off his singing, rather than his screeching, in which the former turns out to be just as amazing as the latter. The lack of rap also provides a very nice interlude to the album. One of my favorites. 4.5/5<br />From The Inside: A very varied (is that correct grammatically? :D) composition of almost all of Linkin Park's rapping and singing styles. A little weird compared to the &quot;classic&quot; LP songs, but still very good. 3.5/5<br />Nobody's Listening: Reallynice flute effects, and some good rapping. It's far more quiet and composed than most Linkin Park songs, and it is almost devoid of Chester screeching. 3.5/5<br />Session: People ask me how I can consider an instrumental to be the best track on a CD. I believe this song shows it. Some of the most amazing scratch work I have EVER heard, by any artist. Awesome drumming, and really nice background melody. One of my favorite songs, ever. This is really a song you can &quot;zone out&quot; to. 5+/5<br />Numb: One of the best songs on the CD... Unlike Somewhere I Belong and In The End, it's endless radio play has not caused it to turn to crap in my mind. 4.5/5<br />Note:<br />All of these ratings are in terms of Linkin Park songs... Even a 2/5 beats the crap out of any other pop or rap artist's songs.
B00004TDTO|5.0|There are few movies that can match the raw terror of JAWS. Made in 1975, it still packs the same punch now as it did almost thirty years ago. JAWS is one of those movies that will never lose its impact on viewers.<br />The movie starts out with a group of college kids partying on the beach, when one of them, Chrissy, decides to go swimming. It's not long before the shark spots her and decides that she'd make a tasty snack. Within a week, there are more shark attacks, one of the most chilling being when a boater in the pond is attacked. Seeing the shark appear and slowly gliding up and attacking him is a scene that has stuck in my mind since the first time I saw it in the theaters back in 1975.<br />Of course, this is a bad thing, to have a rogue shark swimming around that has acquired the taste for human flesh. But what makes it even worse for the community of Amity is that it's right around July 4th, the most crucial time of the year, as it's a mecca for tourists for its beautiful beaches, and a prime tourist spot over the July 4th holiday.<br />One of the victim's mother posts a $3,000 bounty on the shark, and a group of shark hunters catch a large tiger shark, a known man-killer. However, it is proved that this shark is not the one that has been killing off the coast of Amity. Sherrif Brody (Scheider) convinces the mayor to hire Quint (Shaw), a local fisherman, to catch and kill the shark.<br />Quint, Brody and Hooper (Dreyfuss), a marine biologist specializing in sharks, head out to find the shark and kill it. Here is where the movie gets even better, if you can believe it's possible after the first hour. You have four unique characters: Brody, who doesn't exactly enjoy the water; Hooper, who uses modern equipment to track and study sharks; Quint, the headstrong captain of the Orca who lives by the code of the sea; and of course, the shark (affectionately named Bruce). I'm even tempted to include the Orca, as it also has its own unique presence in the film.<br />Almost everything in this movie is done perfectly. They couldn't have picked better actors for Brody, Quint and Hooper. All three are extremely convincing in their roles. Shaw, however, dominates the scenes he's in. The supporting cast of JAWS is also just as well played. The writing, music are top notch, as are the special effects for their time, and can still hold their own against any modern movie. The line &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot; (adlibbed by Scheider) and the Jaws theme have cemented themselves in Americana.<br />JAWS has a great balance of humor to go along with the terror aspects. Even when Brody is extremely depressed about being confronted by Alex's mother (the one who posted the bounty for the shark), the movie manages to pull a smile out of the audience when Brody's son is mocking his movements. And of course, the famous &quot;He made me do it! He talked me into it!&quot; line by the two kids in the water. Also, Quint and Hooper comparing scars by sharks, and Brody looking down at his apendectomy scar./>Almost everything in this movie is done perfectly.

B00006FDCD|4.0|John Wayne Gacy. Clarabelle. Bozo. Pennywise the Dancing Clown. What do these four have in common? They're all members of the most evil collective (outside of mimes) known to man. That's right. They're all clowns.<br />The town of Derry, Maine, has a nasty little secret it's been hiding since the 1700's. Every thirty years, the town experiences a rash of disappearances and ghastly murders, usually involving children. Most of the adults, including the police in the town know about it, but don't say anything.<br />A group of seven kids set out to find what is happening, and in the sewers of the town, they find it. An evil clown (as if there is any other kind) is hiding there, and is killing the kids of Derry. One of them shoots Pennywise with a piece of silver, and Pennywise beats a hasty retreat. They think he's dead, but vow to return to finish the job if he's not.<br />Flash forward another thirty years. Guess what? Yep, more murders, just like what happened when they were kids. The one member of &quot;The Lucky Seven&quot; who remained in Derry calls up his friends, and they all head back (except one, who kills himself rather than face the horror he experienced when he was a kid). It's at this point that the movie takes a turn from a good movie to a *very* good movie.<br />As each of the Seven arrive, they experience surrealistic events, concocted by Pennywise to drive them out of town. And it almost works on numerous occasions. Eventually they see through this, and decide to band together again to rid the town of this oppressing evil. They make their way back to sewer, and eventually find Pennywise, who it turns out is a giant arachnid (an alien?) who merely takes the form of a clown to attract his victims. Again Pennywise is shot with a piece of silver, and they track him down and literally rip him to shreds.<br />I remember seeing this when it first aired, but haven't seen it since. So I went in without really knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.This is one of the best of the Stephen King novels put to the small screen (second only to the excellent &quot;The Stand&quot;). The cast is populated by TV stars, including John Ritter and Harry Anderson. I was really afraid about this, but for the most part they played the roles really well. Harry Anderson did get out of control a couple times, though. Tim Curry is just beyond belief as Pennywise. His portrayal as the evil clown is played so well, you almost get the feeling that he was allowed to view the secret clown rituals where they sacrifice goats and monkeys to their evil deity, Bozo the clown, then all hop in a car built for four and drive off. (OK, none of that last part is true. I just don't like clowns. I think thy're sick, demented people. Feel free to disagree with me.) In short, go out and find this mini-series. It's well worth the time and effort.
0060254920|5.0|\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" was one of my favorite picture books when I was a child.  I loved the story of Max, a boy who is sent to bed without his supper (he was being wild), and imagines himself into a fantasy world where he meets real Wild Things with claws and scary Yellow eyes.  Max is able to tame these Wild Things by commanding them to be still and so they think that Max is the Wildest Wild Thing of them all.  While I loved this story, the pictures were also somewhat scary and areis capable of frightening a child.  If there really were monsters under my bed when I was a kid, I always imagined that they looked liked the Wild Things.  It is hard to believe that this book has been around for forty years, but when I read it again when I was 25 I think I enjoyed it just as much as when I was 6.  This is a great story, though parents should consider what sort of things frighten their children.
0767827716|4.0|Arnold Cunningham (Gordon) finds just that car, which happens to be Christine. It's broken down, rusted and in overall poor condition when he sees it, but he doesn't care. He is going to own this car, and nothing is going to stop him. He spends his college money he's been saving over the summer to fix her up, and in a relatively short time Christine is back up and running.<br />Shortly after getting Christine, Arnold starts changing from the nervous unsure nerd into someone who has a lot of confidence. He even loses his glasses, and starts dating the new student Leigh Cabot (Paul), tagged by the other high shool guys as the most beautiful girl in school. Christine has a symbiot relationship with her owners, where each draws from the love they have for each other. Of course, owning Christine is destructive, as even a mild-mannered kid like Arnold is seduced by the car's evil, eventually not caring who gets hurt when it comes to Christine. <br />The school is populated by all the same kids you went to school with if you were in high school in the early eighties, like me. The jocks, the nerds, the toughs (Ostrander's Buddy Repperton) and the tough's click of groupies, who feed off his energy. Strangely, just the same type relationship that Christine has with her owners. <br />The writing is really good, especially the scenes where the high schoolers are interacting with each other. Took me right back to my own high school days. The music is also extremely effective, although the music composed for the movie is very reminiscent of the music for HALLOWEEN. The best part of the music for me, though, is how the music that Christine plays fits the action that is currently happening. One of my all-time favorite movie soundtracks. <br />There have been a lot of &quot;killer car&quot; movies, including THE CAR, KILLER CAR, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE and even KILLDOZER. But none of them have the magic that CHRISTINE pulls off. While there have been some good movies in this sub-genre, the ones I've seen aren't as good. I think it's due to the source material of Stephen King's novel (in which Cristine was a 4-door) and Carpenter's direction. Combined, it turned out an excellent movie. <br />Th effects are also very well-done. Especially the scene where Christine basically rebuilds herself. It was done with prefabbed balloons, but unless you really look for it, you can't tell. And the scene where a flaming Christine chases one of the toughs down the road is a shot that was also extremely well done.

6305546789|4.0|In 1963, a young Michael Myers kills his older sister, and is sent to a mental institution. Fifteen years later, he escapes, and returns to Haddonfield. He is pursued to Haddonfield by his psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis (Pleasence). There, he enlists the town sherrif (Cyphers) to assist him in tracking down Michael Myers. Meanwhile, Michael has been doing some tracking of his own. He's targeted three teenage girls (Curtis, Loomis and Soles), with particular interest in Curtis's charcter of Laurie Strode (who's Michael's sister).<br />HALLOWEEN is unique in the slasher sub-genre of horror movies, as there is very little blood to speak of. The movie is moderately paced, but not slow to the extent of boredom. It just slowly builds up to a very intense ending scene, with the showdown between the terrified yet determined Laurie, and the seemingly indestructable force that is Michael Myers. That closet-scene is what HALLOWEEN is known for-- even if you're not a horror fan you have to be able to recognize this scene.

6304779356|4.0|Recently divorced Lucy Emerson (Weist) and her two sons move to Santa Carla, CA, and move in with her father. The two teens soon find things to keep their attention. For Sam (Haim), it's the local comic shop, run by the Frog Brothers (Feldman and Jamison Newlander). Michael (Patric) finds a teen girl named Star (Gertz) to hold his attention. However, he soon finds that she spends her time with a group of teen bikers, led by a guy named David (Sutherland). After a couple encounters with the gang, Michael is invited to join them.<br />What he doesn't realize until too late is that these teens are all vampires, and he unwittingly drinks some of David's blood (he is told that it's wine). This has the effect of turning him into a half-vampire. He acquires the attributes of a vampire, such as the ability to fly and superior strength, but he will not become a true vampire until he makes his first kill. He also discovers that Star is in the same situation as he is.<br />Meanwhile, the Frog Brothers tell Sam that Santa Carla is crawling with vampires, which he doesn't believe. But after discovering that Micahael's reflection is fading, and a near attack by his brother, he is convinced they are telling the truth. He teams up with them to rid the town of the blood-suckers, and with the help of Michael discover where David and his friends hang out (literally).<br />There are a lot of really good things about this movie. The script is well written, the acting is above-average, and the effects are really well done. Another thing I liked is the inclusion of some vampire mythology. Especially the part where the gang is eating Chinese food in their hangout, and David uses his power to convince Michael that the rice he's eating is maggots, and that the noodles are really worms. I also liked the fact that they could actually fly without having to turn into bats.<br />Everything worked well in this movie. There was a little bit of gore, action, humor, drama, love story. And believe itor not, I actually enjoyed &quot;The Coreys&quot; being in this movie together. Good call on the casting department to cast both of these guys together, and for getting Sutherland to play David. I thought he was the best actor in this movie. Go pick this movie up and enjoy it, and if you've seen it before, see it again. It's just as good as you remembered.<br />THE LOST BOYS could be viewed as an early example of the Hollywoodization that would come to plague the horror genre in the 90's. It's flashy, it's funny, it's got a few name stars in it, and it was heavily promoted. As far as a horror movie goes, it's really about average. But the overall movie is so watchable (and re-watchable) that it gets a well-deserved four on my horror scale.
B0001IN0DA|2.0|Wrestlemania used to be packed with stars like Vanna White, Mike Tyson and Liberace. There used to be grand entrances for the wrestlers as if they were kings. The best wrestlers on earth used to be there and every match was terrific, worthy of being a main event on any card anywhere. I bought the PPV because I have never missed a Wrestlemania, but boy was I disappointed. The only \\"star\\" from outside of wrestling was Donald Trump, who was interviewed for  about a minute or so. He didn't say anything interesting. He was just sitting there in the audience. There was no rock band this time. The wrestlers did not come out in full force with their royal following, like I used to love. I found myself not caring about the wrestlers that were there, despite watching the weekly TV shows. I wanted to see Hulk Hogan and Brett Hart. I wanted big names in huge matches with serious consequences. I wanted retirement matches, steel cage matches, table matches, hardcore matches. One girl got her head shaved when she lost, but none of the men seemed to have anything on the line in this PPV and it showed. We did not see their best efforts. Most of the wrestlers used the same exact moves and holds as all the others. I found myself not caring how most matches ended. What a departure this was from previous years, when I had the family gathered around me and we cheered and booed and thought our lives depended on the outcomes of the matches. We used to feel a part of Wrestlemania. When I saw a match, I felt like I was wrestling for the championship. This time I just felt like I was wasting $49.95 plus tax on a PPV that never delivered on anything. So the Undertaker returned....so what? He didn't really DO anything when he returned. I am from El Paso and am an eddie Guerrerro fan, but even his match never came close to delivering on the hype. Personally, I think that ever since the wrestlers were divided to go to either Smackdown or RAW, things went downhill very fast. I miss the idea that any wrestler can take on any wrestler any time. That unpredictability was fun. Treating it as two different \\"brands\\" of entertainment really sucks. Right after Wrestlemania XX ended, I told my girlfriend that I just may have to retire from watching the WWE. It just isn't very good anymore. The people at the top don't seem to care. They make so much money every time they hype a Pay Per View that, I guess, they have no incentive to put on a decent show. Give me an iron-man match, followed by a retirement match, followed by a cage match, hardcore match, superstar celebrities, a surprise musical appearance by KISS, remember to show real people having fun and make gigantic matches that people will care about, then wow us with surprise matches featuring great wrestlers of the past that we long to see again. None of this happened at Wrestlemania XX. It was lame, brain-dead, and, despite the fact that I paid $49.95 for the PPV, I started wondering what else might be on TV.ny wrestler can take on any wrestler any time.

0792846443|4.0|Paul Sheldon, an author famous for his Misery Chastaine novels, always goes to the same hotel to complete his novels. After completing his latest novel, he leaves the hotel and heads back to New York to deliver it to his publisher. Unfortunately, he forgets to check the weather, and drives smack into a blizzard, and loses control of his car, which goes careening off the road. Luckily for him (or so it would seem), his number one fan happens to be following him, and manages to get him free of the car before he freezes to death. Annie Wilkes, a former nurse, takes him back to her farm, where she nurses him back to health. Sheldon gives her permission to read his latest novel before it's published as a thank you for saving him. But since it's not a book in the Misery series, she is less than thrilled with it. On one of her excursions into town, she picks up the latest book in the Misery Chastain series, where Sheldon kills her off. This sets Wilkes off, and she demands that he bring her back.<br />What follows is something straight out of a Stephen King novel, who coincidently enough, wrote the book that MISERY was based on. You have murders, hobbling (not for the sqeamish), as well as revelations about Wilkes' checkered past. It has everything a good horror movie needs. But probably the two best things in the movie are it's two main stars, James Caan and Kathy Bates. Caan plays the role of a normal man thrown into a situation that is anything *but* normal to perfection. You can actually feel the pain of hobbling he goes through when Wilkes finds out that he has managed to get out of his room. The expression on his face in that scene is memorable. But Kathy Bates is the cast member who stands out heads and tails above the rest. Her portayal of Annie Wilkes's descent into insanity over what happens to a character is exceptional. She at first appears to be genuinely concerned for Sheldon's well-being, but slowly we realize that she is out for her own wants. Some of my favorite scenes are when she is angry and using foul language. Instead of using some of the more colorful language that most people are used to, she uses &quot;cocka-doody&quot; and &quot;dirty-birdy&quot;. That just cracks me up every time I hear it. It's no wonder she won an Oscar for the role. MISERY is a must-see.
B000084T18|1.0|Come ON!  Is this a joke?  Did somebody really allow this album to be released?  I can say, with 100% certainty, that there are absolutely ZERO redeming qualities about this CD........NONE!  No good beats that require anyone to do anything more than push a few buttons, no good lyrics, and.....wow.......50 cent can NOT rap (and rapping isn't even hard......AT ALL!!)  And yeah 50, you got shot 9 times.....oh great!  Perhaps I should go buy a gun and finish the job (you'd be even prouder then, dumbass).  To anyone who likes this album, I simply ask WHY?  No seriously, why do people like this album?  I really wanna know; if anyone could find anything good about this album, I'd flush my wallet down the toilet.<BR>I hate you, MTV.  (by the way, this rating should be zero stars; why isn't that an option?)<br />P.S. Please God, don't ever allow anyone who sucks this much to have a career in music.  And if you must, kill me first.
B0001611DI|5.0|I've seen Dawn more than any other living dead film aside from Fulci's Zombie. This is definitely my favorite American made zombie classic. Hell, might as well say it's among the best of `em all. Zombie, Gates of Hell, and Burial Ground are all cool because of that cool Italian style, but I feel like Dawn wins won for the home team today. Dawns' modern (well, it was modern) day setting makes it cool and works in a different way than it's Italian buddies. It's horrid, graphic, but also has lots of humor and irony. The social satire is still cool and gives you something to wonder about. Who of us fans hasn't wondered what it would be like to rumble around that mall and what we'd make of a life there? Savini made is mark with this film and has some of the most memorable zombies and gore FX in film ever. The chopper scene, the blood pressure machine, the machete, and tons more all lurk in our brain. If ya got lucky enough to be in Cleveland for the 1st Cinema Wasteland show, then you saw the awesome cast reunion talks. This film is still probably the most widely scene gore film around. Know anyone who hasn't seen this? If so ask them why and what are you waiting for. The soundtrack is awesome as well. There are so many prints of this film, I can't keep up. I've seen the Italian one Argento made into Zombi (cool), a longer, uncut German copy (hate saying longer and uncut in the same sentence, yuck!), the new Anchor Bay re-master (awesome), and a few more. You can't have enough in my opinion. When I was growing up, this was the most popular midnight movie in my area for years after its release. The radio spots and newspaper ads for the theatres were all so awesome. Ahh, the good old days, when it was fun to actually go to a late movie. Romero did his 1st film proud with a sequel that went well beyond the Night. Night is a classic, but Dawns' FX lift it for me above that movie.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Don't be put off the the negative reviews!<br />First up this isn't directly relating to the Matrix films, it is a collection of animated short films set in the Matrix universe or setting.<br />Each is by a different animator/director and each is very different. This is it's strongest point, not a weak point.  <br />The first is a computer gen'd short that most directly follows the matrix movies, but do be honest its more eye candy than story.  On this point it is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, the quality of animation is incredible, going beyond the realism of the Final Fantasy movie computer animation.<br />From here there are two shorts in traditional animation explaining the truly epic history that led to the creation of the matrix and the war.  It is presented as a historical report, with news like footage of different stages and events.  This is the disturbing highlight because it is very logical and plausible, and quite damning of human nature.  Some might not like these two because of the savage imagery but they warn us to not assume that just because we are in a &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;civilised&quot; world we are above the mistakes of oppression made previously.<br />The remaining are very varied, and each is strongly stylised.  One is from the animators of Aeon Flux, with the same surreal and disproportioned style that makes Aeon Flux fascinating to watch.  Another is a detective story with an almost 1960's black and white style, in which a private eye is recruited in the hunt for Trinity.  Read the above review for a rundown on each.<br />Each one for me was fascinating and I've watched this dvd a few times over already.  There are more tie-ins to the movies than you'll realise at first, but at the same time the stories are independant of the movies, free to explore an idea to its end without limit like any good short story or film should.<br />By the way I'm no Matrix freak or even a massive Anime fan, this is just genuinely fresh and fascinating veiwing, presented with heaps of eye candy and an awesome soundtrack to boot.  Perhaps other reviewers were looking for straight matrix bulls**t fight scenes and action, and were disappointed with it having some actual depth?
B00006G8K0|4.0|Hammer's version of the classic Bram Stoker novel Dracula. The story has been rewritten, and while this may bother some people, I rather enjoyed it. Yes, most of the main characters from the novel appeared, but some of the roles have been rewritten. For example, Jonathan Harker is an undercover vampire hunter, who went to Castle Dracula posing as a librarian. His mission is to rid the world of this monster. While he manages to get one of the vampires, he fails to get Dracula. Dr. Van Helsing is a vampire hunter in this version. Plain and simple. He knows exactly who and what Dracula is, and he too is out to kill the Count. Although the story has been rewritten, it is still a very good script. I highly recommend this movie. It is a classic in the horror genre, and one of the better vampire movies. One thing that I am thankful for in the movie is the end scene, where Dracula turns to dust. As is always the case when he dies in this fashion, his ashes are always blown away. But then there is a shot where we see Van Helsing standing next to an open window, thus accounting for the sudden breeze. A fact that a lot of other horror movies tend to overlook.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|For this review, I'll just give a track by track analysis comparing each one to the original 1987 CD Version:<br />Get Back- Same as the original only with a clean ending.<br />Dig A Pony- Same as the original without the chatter at the beginning or at the end.<br />For You Blue-The rhythm track is the same except the intro and George's vocal are different.<br />The Long And Winding Road-Completely different version with slightly different lyrics.<br />Two Of Us-It's the original without John saying at the beginning, &quot;I dig a pygmie by Charles Hawtry and The Deaf Aids...&quot;<br />I've Got A Feeling-It's different from the released version though it sounds almost identical.<br />One After 909-Same as the original without the chatter at the end. Good sound quality here.<br />Don't Let Me Down-Totally different. The version on &quot;Past Masters Vol. 2&quot; is arguablly better.<br />I Me Mine- Remove the chorus and the orchestra from the original and you have this.<br />Across The Universe-No chorus and slightly speeded up.<br />Let It Be-It sounds the same but there are certain parts not heard on the original.<br />&quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; is a disc full of sounds of the group talking and rehearsing in the studio. It's interesting but expendable.<BR>The sound quality is improved but I recommend this only if you're a die hard.

I like Bruce as much as the next guy, but Bruce as a humble Monk, please!<BR> He was cocky, brash, and arrogant. Sure he could back it up, but I can't see him as Caine.<BR> I could be wrong but I am happy with Kung-Fu as is. Ok , they cropped it, but at least you can see on DVD. It could be perfect , but it's not, such is life. I think it's been a long time coming, I like it, I bought it. I am happy.
B00013EY7Q|1.0|What was the Academy thinking?  Yawn....Big big yawn !
B00004X01U|3.0|This was a anxious release, after the amazing album that is &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Madonna&quot; Decided to release a new album 2 years later called &quot;Music&quot;, the first single &quot;Music&quot; Was Cool, went to #1, yeah whatever. Then came her really cool song &quot;Dont tell me&quot; then &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;..This is an album that has alot to offer, but is hardly her best, even though its really cool songs. This I give 3 Stars because Its not bad, but its not her best. But I reccomend you give &quot;Music&quot; A go. You wont be that dissapointed in her new Reinvention For The Millenium.

If you wasted your money buying a sorry CD like this one,Your just as sorry.
0609610570|3.0|According to this book, execution is the missing link between aspirations and results. The book also makes the claim that &quot;the biggest obstacle to success is the absence of execution&quot;. Nowadays the business world is more cut-throat than ever, and discipline becomes more and more important in issues of organisational efficiency. However, I don't believe that businesses can afford to take matters into their own hands to the extent recommended in this book. It may be true that without execution, breakthrough thinking on managing change breaks down, and it also may be true that a certain amount of discipline is necessary for getting things done, but surely condoning and encouraging execution itself is taking things a bit far. Couldn't these corporate bigshots satisfy themselves with a bit of corporal punishment and leave it at that?
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Gothika is a pretty good horror/psychological suspense show. Mathieu Kassovitz doesn't give us any great surprises (you can figure out what is going on fairly early in the film) plot wise, but he gives some great shots. And Halle Berry gives us some great moments on film. She shows just how great of an actress, just how intense she is. The rest of the cast gives a solid performance. The dvd is a bit sparse. There is the Limp Bizkit video, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, which is a great song and a very well done video. There is also a commentary with director Mathieu Kassovitz and DOP Matthew Libatique, who actually calls himself a cinematographer on the commentary track. As well he should because the cinematography itself is a character in itself. The lighting, the camera movements, the locations, all add to the atmosphere, more so than in many other movies. The two compliment each other both in filming and in the commentary track.
0783225792|4.0|Casino is a stylish and entertaining story of a casino boss with mafia connections. Perhaps most impressive is the cinematography, particularly the opening sequence which backgrounds the Vegas atmosphere and mob involvement in operating the casino. DeNiro is perfect as the casino boss, and Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods are also well cast in their respective roles. The narrative is entertaining but has no particularly clever twists, although this is largely determined by the fact that it is based on a true story.<br />However the slick presentation of the film overall is marred somewhat by the graphic violence, particularly scenes involving Pesci's character Nicky Santoro which are disturbing rather than entertaining. And while credit must be given for Stone's performance as Rothstein's scheming and semi-derranged wife, the repetitive and esculating portrayals of their arguing are rather unpleasant to watch. <br />I personally liked Casino more than Goodfellas, mostly for the visual elements and intrigue of the Las Vegas environment. However criticisms that Scorcese has indulged in rehashing the same formula as Goodfellas should not be overlooked, as the cast is nearly identical and there are some scenes that are too similar to be in a different movie. While a good film in its own right, it would be difficult to argue that it is much more than another Goodfellas filmed in Las Vegas.
0060591706|3.0|Bueno si estoy un poco decepcionada del libro.. quiza bastante ... es que no me ha gustado mucho, mas bien quiza solo me gusto un poquito... hay pasajes buenos.. aunque parece una copia de Indiana Jones, definitivamente falta mucha originilidad y los personajes son tan poco creibles, ademas ya me tenian medio china (aburrida) con eso del nio jaguar y la nia aguila. La abuela que en el primer libro desempeo mas papel ahora casi que ni se mira. El monje y el principe me han hecho simpaticos, al final ellos salvan la novela.. aunque por ratos tambien cansan, el pobre rey hombre sabio aunque demasiado educado..jeje.. y ese cuento de El Especialista y El Coleccionista ... que barbaridad, mejor se hubiera inventado otra historia, por ratos pensaba que estaba leyendo a Cesar Guzman, la batalla .. Santo Dios.. no nada que ver .. de plano yo me quedo con el primero, me gusto.. como dije con el primero queria ir a Amazonas con este prefiero ir a Galerias (un centro comercial en mi pais) !!! ... ahh y para rematar era mas que obvio que la famosa Judit tenia algo que ver en todo eso ??!?!!!!!
0783225903|5.0|Finally, a movie for anyone who has ever been caught up in or feared being caught up in the teeth of our bureaucratic nightmare machine! Terry Gilliam has turned his laser-wit on \\"the system\\" and fashioned a tale of sinister idiocy and insidiously institutionalized inefficiency -stroke- ineptitude. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a drone for the Ministry Of Information, a burocracy of dizzying stupidity and towering uselessness, set up in order to gather information on anyone suspicious. After all, these are dangerous times! We need protection from... ourselves. Anyway, Sam quietly drudges away his life with the other drones, perfectly hidden from upward mobility. However, Sam has a dream of escape. In his dream, Sam is a winged hero, flying high above the dull horror of his reality to save a beautiful woman (Kim Griest). We can soar with him, before waking up to get ready for our own 9-5 incarcerations. Sam is up for a promotion (thanks to his influential mum, played by Katherine Helmond) to Information Retrieval. Sam doesn't want to be promoted. He just wants to get by, get it over with, and get out. Unbeknownst to Sam, a man named \\"Buttle\\" has been arrested, bagged, taken to Information Retrieval, questioned, tortured, and killed. This would be normal routine, except for the fact that the man they wanted was named \\"Tuttle\\", not \\"Buttle\\". Oops! A refund check arrives in Sam's office, returning funds charged for the wrongful interrogation of poor Buttle. Sam's boss, Mr. Kurtzman (Ian Holm) is panic-stricken, not knowing what to do with the check. Sam tries to pass it on to another bureau to no avail. He finally decides to take the check to Mrs. Buttle in person. Once there,he is attacked by the mourning family. He also catches a glimpse of the girl in his dreams. Sam is obsessed with her, and takes his promotion to Information Retrieval when he finds out that the girl is a suspected terrorist. He figures it's his best chance at meeting her. Well, unfortunately for Sam, he has just entered the core of the insane asylum. His friend Jack Lint (Michael Palin) is a mild-mannered inquisitor. He \\"questions\\" folks like Buttle, seeking information. Sam witnesses first-hand the gruesome truth of the entire mess. His dreams become nightmares of his battles with a titanic metallic beast, with his dreamgirl caged and floating away. Sam is reaching his own critical mass. Thankfully, Sam has made a friend with Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), who once fixed Sam's air conditioner. Tuttle is among the MOI's most wanted criminals. He is a man of mystery. He is pretty much everything that Sam Lowry dreams of being. He helps Sam to overcome his deadening ordinariness, and to rescue his dream girl (come to life) from the clutches of the system. Lowry tries his best to protect the girl, leading to his own downfall. The terror really sinks in when Sam himself is bagged, brought in, and strapped into the inquisitor's chair. Of course, his best friend Jack is the one who must extract Sam's confession. There is no exit now. Sam has reached the end of the line. He finds out that his only escape is to fall into insanity, the ultimate dream-state. Please, watch this movie and tell everyone you know about it! I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. Go get it -stroke- watch it -stroke- see what I mean...

B00005JLRT|2.0|The run of events wasn't a half bad idea. The wedding wasn't a bad idea for the character development. The ending battle scene wasn't bad either. It was dramatic, but not spectacular. The results for the quadrent at the end of the movie were also a nice turn of events; Peace talks begin between the Federation and the Romulan Empire. <br />Data's destruction was sad and I think it could have been built up better or not done at all. There should have been some type of emotional build-up with Data and the audiance so the death could mean something. It felt a little empty to me when it happened. Between Picard's and Data's major roles in the plot, the rest of the crew were just glorified extras.<br />The plot is an offend twisted mess of events. It seems like they had a number of good ideas and made the movie overnight. If they put more time towards the development of the plot and took out some unnecessarily long scenes, they could have made something of a classic ending for this crew's voyages.<br />Personally, I do think it does have a lot of holes in the plot, and isn't much better than the last one. It's kind of sad to say, but the movie isn't worth watching if you only want to see a classic TNG movie. Go watch First Contact. If I could, just to be nice, I would rate it as a 2 1/2 stars movie.

But I love these kind of send up whacky comedys, and this one is high up there with the best of them all! <br />Charlie Sheen plays Topper Harley and has had a bad past with the US Air Force and has quit the army... but the Army needs him once again and with non stop stupidity and comedy through the movie from door bells on Indian Tee Pees, to Barbequing hot hots with the jets of fighter planes, and a dog that just keeps getting sat on amongst many others, this movie will have you laughing your tushy off!<br />Its no acadamey award winner, but thats obviously not the idea for this comic life movie! It parodys a lot of movies, mostly Top Gun, but adds its own great jokes to the plot with outrages slapstick humour!<br />Part 2 - Wasnt as great.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Just an observation: <br />ENTHUSIASM DOES NOT BECOME HYPE SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT SHARE IT. <br />I might not want to bungee jump, but those who praise it having tried it are not hyping it. <br />They are just showing how much they love it.<br />What &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has received from critics and fans is not hype but praise. And the praise is deserved, no matter how many weird conspiracy-theories people have to make up to justify their own lack of awareness or response. <br />Sometimes when a film confuses some members of the audience, it's because the director has failed to get a point or a mood across. But Sofia Coppola obviously reached enough people - who have then become wildly enthusiastic (no need to &quot;bend over backwards&quot; to show that the failure is not hers. <br />I asked myself what she could have done to satisfy those who found it boring. All she could have done was make an entirely different movie. And nothing can make you like a movie that just is not YOUR kind of movie. <br />There are a lot of films like this. Sometimes you don't like them because their politics aren't yours (I'd even bet right-wingers hate this movie more than left-wingers incidentally, because it blurs lines it discomforts them to see blurred.) <br />Sometimes you don't like them because their worldview is inimical to yours, (like all those movies that let the &quot;hero&quot; ride roughshod over legal process because &quot;the laws&quot; let crooks get away). I don't think very many big fans of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; tripe will like &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.<br />Coppola, Murray, Johansson, Accord, Ribisi, Farris, and the excellent Japanese cast made their movie well. As for those who don't go for it, well maybe the fault lies not in the stars (or director) but in your selves.

0930289455|5.0|I brought this as a 1st addition when it came out and it's one of the few stories i've re-read time and time again.  It's a story of two men who take different paths when their lives hit bottom but find they have a lot in common.  I loved seeing the Jokers' life before he turned to crime and evil though he is, you see the events that turn him into the man he is now (with a small contribution from batman - read and find out).  Reading this comic is what made is difficult from me to enjoy the first batman movie.  Well, how could the joker have killed batman's parents if they are roughly the same age and batman was there when he changed?  Read this great comic-novel and enjoy it much as I did, you won't be sorry.
B000002L9Y|5.0|After the uneventful &quot;Mirage&quot;, released in 1982, Fleetwood Mac went on a long hiatus. Stevie Nicks kept on enjoying tremendous solo success, while Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham did just fine on their own solo albums. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, however, both went off the deep end; Fleetwood encountered financial difficulties, while John McVie almost died from alcohol abuse. In other words, some of the band members didn't seem to need Fleetwood Mac that much, but some others did. &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; was born from the tension of trying to answer the eternal question : was it worth all the heartache and trauma to keep Fleetwood Mac alive ?<br />The answer came in the form of a brilliant album which proved that all personal differences asides, these five people were meant to make music together. The album was a decidedly 80's sonic adventure - which I mean in a good way - and the production featured Fleetwood Mac at its most polished and gorgeous. It's obivous that Lindsey Buckingham gave the album its edge, and not just because of his guitar playing and top production skills : &quot;Caroline&quot; and the title track were particularly impressive, and the first single (&quot;Big Love&quot;) was an instantly distinctive diversion from the mid-80's radio diet of Bon Jovi and Europe. Yet it's Christine McVie who unexpectedly turned out to be the album's strongest card, with beautiful vocal performances, strong keyboard arrangements, and most of all, great songs : &quot;Little Lies&quot; is one of the catchiest, most elegant pop songs of the 80's, while &quot;Everywhere&quot; was simply a gorgeous song that featured the Mac's trademark vocal harmonies as if it was still 1977. Her other songs were the hard-rocking, impressive &quot;Isn't it midnight&quot; - not your typical Christine McVie song at all, yet it became a favourite in their 1987-88 tour - and the sublime &quot;Mystified&quot;, a longing ballad where Lindsey's production skills were at their best. There were even a couple of songwriting collaborations between McVie and Buckingham, most notably the album's ultra-melodic closer &quot;You and I (part 2)&quot;. Those lucky enough to put their hands on &quot;You and I (part 1)&quot;, not available on the album, discovered that it was just as brilliant, and should have been on the album too.<br />As for Stevie Nicks, her songs from this album have often been harshly criticized. All she got was three songs, and none of them are well-remembered today. For sure, there wasn't a &quot;Landslide&quot; or a &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; in the lot; however, it doesn't mean that they don't have any artistic merit - on the contrary. &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, the catchy second single, was a cool midtempo rocker where Stevie's voice was well complimented by the band's harmonies. &quot;Welcome to the room... Sara&quot; had to be understood in the context of her stint in rehab, and I always felt it was a highlight of the album. As for the touching &quot;When I See You Again&quot;, Stevie wrote about some universal feelings of confusion, longing, and fear, best expressed through the line &quot;If she sees him again / Will your very best friend / Have been replaced by some other ?&quot;. Her voice on that song was expressive, and it embodied the whole ambivalence of the song.<br />All in all, the only minor moment of the album is &quot;Family Man&quot;, sounding like an average pop-dance song and featuring some shaky vocal arrangements that bubbled away in the bridge. The album &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; is a superbly produced album that proved Fleetwood Mac was as contemporary as anybody; it featured gorgeous arrangements, first-rate material, and it did open up the ears of a whole new generation of fans - including this writer, who discovered Fleetwood Mac's music with this album. The fact that it was the last full studio album recorded by these five people, only gives it the additional poignancy that comeswith knowing that it was sort of their swan song. I consider it an essential in Fleetwood Mac's long, rich history of rock and roll legacy.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I absolutely adore this soundtrack. Its fluid movement and simple melody is haunting, beautiful, and positively breathtaking. &quot;Unwelcome Friend&quot; is particularly beautiful; it's my favorite track. This CD is a major credit to a fantastic movie.
0345440900|3.0|There's some very useful information in this book.  I found the section on interpreting a baby's body language worth the price of admission.  She also give some good, commonsense tips on various aspects of baby care, such as bathing, and there's a nice step-by-step guide to infant massage.  <br />I found the section on sleep, however, to be vastly overrated--which was disappointing because that was the main reason I bought the book, since so many women I knew swore by it.  Her method might work better if you start using it the minute after your baby is born, but her famous &quot;three-day magic&quot; for breaking bad sleep habits did not work for my eight-week-old.  Her tips for soothing and reading a baby's sleep cues were helpful, but this &quot;responding, not rescuing&quot; routine of picking the baby up every time he cries and setting him down as soon as he stops did nothing but frustrate my child and make him cry (and thus delay sleep) all the longer.  Also, she doesn't seem to take into account that your child might actually cry himself to sleep in your arms (which is what mine did), and if you put him down immediately, you'll interrupt his sleep stage--which she emphatically tells you NOT to do!  It might be easier if you had only one child and could spend an hour and a half or two in his room, constantly picking him up and laying him back down, and if you want to do that, go ahead.  But new parents should bear in mind that this is not THE ONE TRUE WAY to put your child to bed, and don't assume that if it doesn't work for your baby you must be doing it wrong.  Maybe it's just wrong for your baby (and you).  <br />Yes, she does have a bit of an ego problem for someone who only had two kids and apparently spaced them several years apart, but I didn't find her condescending.  I thought her casually authoritative voice made for easier reading.  But use this book as a reference, not a bible.  Not because she gives false information about breastfeeding and formula(she doesn't), but because her philosophy of childcare is just one among several that you can adopt (or adapt) for your parenting lifestyle.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is one of two movies I will site as creating a desire to have my time wasted watching the film returned to me. I don't care how, time machine, karmic reversals, spatial anomaly...

B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said yet? The show is fourteen episodes of goodness: tight plot construction, inventive world building, shaded characterizations and tangy, witty dialogue. Think about it this way -- what other show, science fiction or not, has engendered so much loyalty, love and outright fury at FOX after airing only FOURTEEN episodes? The show didn't even complete one season and still its entertainment value is nigh immeasurable.<br />In this DVD set, you'll get three episodes that I think are outstanding: &quot;Out of Gas,&quot; &quot;Ariel&quot; and &quot;Objects in Space.&quot; The other eleven are all variously fun, funny and tense. You get all that along with seven commentaries, widescreen formatting (beautiful, by the way), two short documentaries (one about the show and which still makes me a little teary to watch and another about the ship, Serenity), a gag reel, Joss singing... it's all beautiful, except for the last. <br />Buy this set! See the movie! Prove FOX for the pathetic wretches they so obviously are!

B0000TLA9G|1.0|Don't get me wrong this album is great. But if you are a true G-N-R fan don't buy this as it was released buy the recording studio not the band.

In other words the band will not make 1 dime off this release only the studio will make money off this if you buy it which is wrong.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and the crew of the HMS Surprise are detailed to capture a much larger and more powerful French warship without benefit of support in the South Atlantic during the early 19th century.  Director Peter Weir gives us a terrific adventure film with painstaking attention to detail that made me feel as if I were really on a ship at sea.  The impressive special effects and spectacular battles do not overshadow the characters and human drama.  Various crew members are presented efficiently and well acted so that we feel that they are not merely fodder to be blown up for our entertainment but living, breathing people that we hope will survive the violence-though not all of them do.  The centerpiece of the film is the friendship between the captain and ship's surgeon Maturin (Paul Bettany).  They present opposing sides of human nature and their conversations provide a fascinating commentary on the ethics and stakes of the events in the film./
B000002WCJ|2.0|mmmm...where do I start? First of all, I do think that Helloween are a group of very talented musicians who produce excellent music at times. This CD, however, is a little tricky. Contrary to other reviews of this album, I am giving it 2 stars instead of 5. I first picked up this CD when I was first getting into Iron Maiden a few years ago, cos I heard that Maiden and Helloween were very similar. First of all, the cover...OH MY GOD! A monster's hand battling with a hand that holds a key..horrified faces in the water below...sunlight...darkness...aaaaah! It's definitely the scariest cover I've seen! The guitars,although they are played with absolute precision, freak me out cos they are so different and sound weird. The vocals also scare me, but then again they are pretty good. Dr Stein is a spooky track, and other tracks off the CD also spook me. OK, when they play calm, acoustic music they are a joy to listen to, but when the heavy stuff comes in on this album, it sends shivers down my spine!<br />I can see how some people can like this CD, but my opinion is this: if you are new to this band, get any of their CDs other than this one first, and then, if you become hooked, maybe try this one out.

B00005A1VH|5.0|I have to rate this movie as a true classic with the likes of Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, and The Longest Day.  People may think it corny or outdated but for me it just gets better each time I watch it.  My only complaint, if you can call it that...more of a comment, are 2 small technicalities: 1) York was not issued and did not use a 1903 Springfield rifle as he did in the movie.  He was issued a Pattern 1917 Enfield rifle and used this in the battle where he won the Medal of Honor.  When the US entered WW1 there were insufficient quantities of '03 Springfields for every serviceman.  The US had been making Enfield rifles for the British in caliber .303 and had a large number of them on-hand when we entered the war.  So the government took them, rechambered them for caliber .30-06 and issued them to the US servicemen. 2) York did not use a captured German Luger pistol to shoot the german troops charging down the hill.  He used a US Colt 1911 .45 caliber pistol, but during filming the Colt 1911 pistol would not cycle properly when firing blanks and the Luger was substituted.  Other than that, a movie that will remain timeless.
B000002OX7|1.0|Pete Townsend dominates the songwriting on this album too much.  Why didn't he let Keith Moon's talents shine?  I've heard Keith's solo album, and his songwriting was an untapped resource.
B000002H6C|5.0|\\"...And Justice for All\\" was Metallica's best and last great album.  They mastered their unique blend of heavy metal, hardcore, and progressive rock and produced one of the greatest albums of all time.  <BR>The darkness and doom come through with deafening clarity.  This may be due to the recent loss of their friend and bass player, Cliff Burton.  The pain of that loss may have been channeled into the song writing and lyrics.  The sadness and depression are converted into a passionate rage.<br />\\"Energy derives from both the plus and negative\\" shouts James Hetfield in \\"Eye of the Beholder.\\"  That statement defines the whole purpose of anger and depression-based music.  This album is a great example.  Love songs and party songs that are considered uplifting are usually based in denial and mindlessness.<BR>\\"Blackened\\" blasts off the album at hyper speed pummeling.  The title track builds up and crumbles just like the statue depicted on the cover.  \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" is an in-your-face, methodical stomping.  <BR>Unfortunately, Metallica released their first music video for the song \\"One.\\"  It put the song in the Top 40 singles at the time and pointed the masses in their direction, which eventually helped corrupt them.  However, it's one of the greatest metal songs of all time.  Like \\"Sanitarium\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\" it was a ballad turned into a vicious assault.  When they speed up half way through the song, it's one of the most furious few minutes in the history of rock and roll.<BR>They continue buzz sawing right through your head with \\"The Shortest Straw,\\" a nihilistic provocation.  \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" chops down anything standing in its way without hesitation.  The sinister \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" is a violent warping of the mind.  \\"To Live Is to Die\\" cuts right into the bone and is chilling and beautiful at the same time.  \\"Dyers Eve\\" closes the album with the most manically angry song Metallica ever wrote.  Hetfield's sandpaper voice spews the very definitionof angst.<BR>People complain about the low production value of this album.  Metallica didn't need high quality production to make this album stand up.  Their music and emotion were more than enough.  That's the mark of a great album by a great band.
B00004XONN|1.0|Pretentious, droning music that wouldn't have even made Pink Floyd's b-sides. Avoid at all costs. It consistently amazes me how this sits on the shelf and David Gates from Bread can't even get a record deal.  Stick with &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.
B000001FDK|5.0|Given the national funk the USA was in, the songs in Grease was also a longing for a funner, simpler time, when rock wasn't so complicated.  Stylishly, it's 50's music, some with 70's disco sensibilities, 70's non-disco pop, and songs whose sound harken back to the stage play, clearly meant to stay within the confines of the movie.<br />The order of songs on the soundtrack frontloads the theme song and singles in the first part before getting back in movie order for the rest.  Now, in order of the movie...<br />After the brief &quot;Love Is A Many Splendored Thing,&quot; comes the title song, the perfect marriage of the 50's, exemplified by singer, Frankie Avalon, and the catchy disco-like rhythms of the 70's, hardly surprising given that Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees penned this song.<br />&quot;Summer Nights&quot; the first duet between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, featuring members of the cast, harkens back to its stage origins, with the differing versions of what went on in Danny and Sandy's fateful summer marked by vocal tradeoffs between the two, highlighted by predominantly male voices in Travolta's segment, female ones in Newton-John's.<br />&quot;Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee&quot; too is a stagey song, sung by Stockard Channing when making fun of Sandy, with references to Elvis, Troy Donahue, and Doris Day making it a look back at the late 50's.  The sugary pop ballad &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; was tailor-made for Newton-John, a ballad alternately with steel guitars one moment, strings the next.<br />&quot;Why this car is automatic, it's systematic, it's hydromatic.  Why it's greased lightning!&quot;  For downright fun and energy, &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; bears the hallmark of Elvis and Eddie Cochrane-type rockers, an ideal song accompanying the spanking red hot rod fantasy sequence.<br />&quot;It's Raining On Prom Night,&quot; sung by Cindy Bullens, is another vintage 50's-type slow ballad, and is the song that plays when Sandy goes to the jukebox, only to have Danny make fun of the jock she's hanging out with.<br />Frankie Avalon's slow-dance &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; is a nod back to the days when his &quot;Venus&quot; was a big hit, strings laden doo-wop style female accompaniment including Stockard Channing.  This number was done in the guardian angel (Avalon) telling Frenchie to get her act together and go back to school.<br />&quot;Rock And Roll Party Queen&quot; can be briefly heard in the dance segment when the people start entering the decorated gym.<br />Another example of 50s/70s dynamic is Sha-Na-Na, who spearheaded a rock and roll revival movement.  Their songs is one fun track after another, from Danny and the Juniors' &quot;Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay,&quot; the slow dance of &quot;Those Magic Changes,&quot; Little Anthony's &quot;Tears On My Pillow,&quot; Big Mama Thornton's &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; the  climactic and fun-brimmed &quot;Born To Hand Jive,&quot; and then a cover of &quot;Blue Moon.&quot;<br />Travolta's solo song &quot;Sandy,&quot; done after Sandy storms out of his car after his manhandling her, is more a defense than an apology, as he says in the monologue that she hurt him.  The monologue he has inbetween the singing segments is more a hallmark of girl group songs like &quot;Leader Of The Pack.&quot;  Solo, Travolta's actually not bad, replicating 50's-style falsetto at times.<br />Next, is another Stockard Channing solo, &quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do&quot; and a reprise of &quot;Sandra Dee&quot; by Olivia Newton-John, before the final blowout.  In the interview segment of the video, Olivia Newton-John herself knew that with the bouncy bassline throughout the energetic &quot;You're The One That I Want,&quot; the second Travolta duet, was going to be a hit, and it was.  And in the movie, it's followed by the equally vivacious &quot;We Go Together,&quot; which could've been a single.<br />Other notes:  These were not included in the movie:&quot;Alone At the Drive-In,&quot; &quot;Freddy My Love,&quot; &quot;Mooning,&quot; and &quot;Rock N Roll Party Queen&quot; were in the movie, because I don't remember them.  Another exemplary soundtrack from the 70's and perhaps of all time.ne At the Drive-In,&quot; &quot;Freddy My Love,&quot; &quot;Mooning,&quot; and &quot;Rock N Roll Party Queen&quot; were in the movie, because I don't remember them.

630522577X|5.0|This is possibly one of the best musicals of all time (at any rate, definately one of my personal favorites).  The songs are superb.  Some, like &quot;I Could Have Danced all Night&quot; and &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; are romantic and sweet; many, like &quot;Show Me,&quot; &quot;Just You Wait,&quot; &quot;A Little Bit of Luck,&quot; &quot;Without You,&quot; and &quot;Why Can't a Woman be More Like a Man?&quot; are quite amusing.  A few of the latter catagory are nowhere near politically correct, but somehow that makes it all the more hilarious.<br />My only complaint would have to be that I wish they'd used Julie Andrews as Eliza Dolittle.  I heard her sing some of the songs from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; once and her Cockney was much more believable than that of Audrey Hepburn, or Marni Nixon (who sang for Hepburn).

076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom was a short, easy read. Although the book is about life and death, it is not a deep book, but rather sweetly emotional. The book gives the reader a fresh and true look at life.<br />Tuesdays With Morrie is a story about a student and a teacher that share a special bond. The teacher is \\"teaching his last lesson\\", the lesson of life and death. Morrie, the teacher, is sharing with Mitch, his student, his surprisingly positive approach to his impending death.<br />For me, Morrie had two main lessons he wanted Mitch to learn. The first was about the culture of society. Morrie observed that people get too caught up with making more money, buying more things, and focusing only on beauty. Morrie thinks that the secret to happiness is surrounding yourself with people you love, your friends and your family. This unselfish love is what brings the greatest joy and peace to one's life. Also, instead of doing something because of the money or fame it might bring you, do something that you enjoy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I am reviewing the DVDs, not the actual movie; however the movie also gets 5 stars. First things first: Lord of the Rings is a single long novel. The films are a single long story. For those who are new to Middle-earth, I HIGHLY recommend seeing 'Fellowship of the Ring' first, or if you already have, see it JUST before this one. A great adaptation of the second section of the book. It's also the only one of the three that strays a little bit story wise. I expereinced Middle-earth by seeing film one, read the book, and now seeing films 2 & 3. After reading the book and going into the cinema, the best things about this movie is seeing Gollum; Treebeard and the ents when they... you'll see; and one of the famous battles of the War of the Ring, Helm's deep. The 'making of' features continue, just as the films do. As before, the MOVIE is split over 2 DVDs, with the other 2 being documentaries. All in all, if you love LOTR, and have 'Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition', get this one.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Alright, listen.<br />This album was put out against every single member's wishes, &amp; it's completely pointless &amp; EMBARASSING! This is not the Guns n' Roses I knew/know &amp; love. Of course it has some of their greatest &quot;hits&quot;, &amp; if that's what you wanted when you saw the cover, then so be it. But like half of it are covers &amp; that in itself is embarassing for them &amp; shadows over their credibility.<br />Even if you're a new fan or someone who would like to start getting into them, DON'T start here. This is so watered down &amp; I just find it disappointing &amp; definitely not a good way to keep &quot;us&quot; occupied until Chinese f-cking Democracy is released... a record no one cares to really wait for anymore.<br />Trust me, if you can't afford much right now... go to used CD shops or discount outlets. Or even borrow them from a friend. It's been almost 17 years since the release of &quot;Appetite&quot; &amp; I know you can find their REAL greatest hits record for an acceptable price *somewhere*. Because that $ has a better chance of going towards the band then this one ever will.
B0001AP12G|2.0|I'VE BEEN CONNED! I'VE BEEN HOODWINKED! I'VE BEEN BAMBOOSLED! Don't get me wrong, Kayne West is a fabulous producer! His beats are off the hook, but his rhymes are WACK! I am sooo mad that I actually went out and bought this album. The beats are amazing of course, but lyrically, my 3-year-old niece could have come better than he did.  The only good song on the entire album was \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and that's because J was on it. Everything else was TRASH. I really hate that I have to say all this because, like most hip hop fans, I was anticipating something hot from this fresh, young rapper.  Instead, I was given some major bull.  On this album, I feel like West is struggling to match words together like a colorblind person struggles to find a matching pair of socks.  Instead of nodding my head to most of the songs, I sat, puzzled, staring at my stereo trying to fiqure out what he was saying. Yes, West does have some postive messages in many of his songs (i.e.-Jesus Walks) it's just that he is the wrong person to deliver them.  His flow sucks and the words that he puts together make him sound more like that kid who raps about \\"errbody in the club gettin' tips\\" than a Mos Def or Talib Kweli.  I don't know what the hype was all about.  People need to realize that just because one can put two words that rhyme together, it doesn't mean that he/she can rap. Maybe if he had stayed in college a little longer he would be able to come up with a more complex rhyme scheme- not the grade school word play he's working with now. I'm happy that he has a positive message and incredible insight, but he needs to play the background and stick to making some postive beats.  P.S. I'm not being a hater, I'm just tellin' it like it T-I-IS!
B00009RAJI|5.0|Amazing...in addition to a brilliantly remastered verison of one of THE greatest albums of all time, it also contains some rough early tracks that any Mac fan would cherish.  The best demos are of \\"Gold Dust Woman\\"..before it became the haunting anthem of love, loss and drugs.  Stevie's voice is just amazing on Silver Springs...as it was intended to be.  It will truly give you chills to hear her screaming to Lindsey that she will forever remain in his memory.<br />A very early version of Christine McVie's \\"Oh Daddy\\" is also a real treat.  The vocals are amazing with Stevie on harmony making it obvious why this album went on to make history.<br />Any Fleetwood Mac fan should buy this album...you will forever cherish it!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Can't say i've ever listened much to johnny cash. I remember seeing him years ago hawking bank machines (the johnny cash money machines). Thats about it. I knew he was out there but never really had any interest in his music. <BR> And then, this weekend, while watching the remake to 'Dawn of the Dead', the opening song was 'the man comes around' from american IV. <BR>Well, i went out and bought the cd and i must admit, i like it. the whole thing. That nine inch nails song he covered (hurt) was amazing. Thats the way the song was meant to be sung. Who knew there was that much depth to trent reznor? His rendition certainly didnt get it across. But johnny sings that song and brings out the pain and lament in trents lyrics. <BR>After listening to this album, i feel like i've been missing out on something.
0452282152|5.0|This was an awesome book. Though I am only fourteen years old, I thought that this book was awesome.  It has become my favorite book. It was interesting to get the view of the girl in the portrait, THE GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING.  If you enjoy reading about someone else's life experiences this is the book to read.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Do you want to watch a film that goes nowhere?  If so, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is for you.<br />I rarely ever write negative reviews but I couldn't resist doing so for this one since I can honestly say that I have not been disappointed in a movie in a very long time as I have been with this film.  <br />With all the hype and hoopla surrounding this film, I was expecting to see something decent and entertaining when I finally got around to renting it.  Thank goodness I only rented it. I pity those who actually bought the dvd and found out what a bore it really is.  <br />I saw this film around Oscar time and actually got to watch 4 of the 5 nominated Best Picture films.  Of the 4, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; was by far the best and most brilliant, followed by &quot;Master &amp; Commander,&quot; then &quot;Seabiscuit.&quot;  I could barely sit through &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot;  I talked to a handful of other people who have seen this and we all said the same thing: &quot;what a piece of overrated mush&quot; (except some of them were less kind than I was).  It truly is a film that goes nowhere.  Scarlett Johansson's character spends half the movie looking out the window in her Tokyo hotel smoking a cigarette. Bill Murray is either lying on his bed in the same Tokyo hotel or sitting in the bar and drinking himself silly.  They meet, hang out a few times then Bill Murray goes home.  That's about it.  Goodness knows Sofia Coppola wouldn't have won that Best Original Screenplay Oscar if not for her family name and Hollywood connections.  Her work with &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; was much better.<br />If you want a great Bill Murray movie, rent or buy &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; or &quot;Rushmore&quot; instead.  These films are entertaining and feature Bill Murray at his best.  And anyone, I mean 'anyone,' could have played Scarlett Johansson's role.  There was barely any acting involved there.  Though I am not a big fan of &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; I think that film deserved the 5th spot for Best Picture much more than this movie.  In short, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; was robbed.<br />My verdict? &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; = a complete waste of time.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of those books that you read in one sitting on a quiet evening curled up with a cup of tea. It is a powerful story of two men at different stages of life's journey. The young man rediscovers his mentor, a favorite college professor, who is dieing of ALS. The story is told by the young man sharing the insights he gained from reconnecting with Morrie and life insights that Morrie shares with him. I found myself listening as if I was right there with Morrie and Mitch. (I dog-eared many pages that touched beneath the surface that I will refer back to over and over again throughout the rest of my life.)<br />Mitch wrote this very personal story, with love, respect, and admiration for the man that had touched his life when he was a young college student. It is written with raw emotion and honesty about how easy it is to lose sight of your youthful/college dreams and aspirations once you move into the mainstream. Reuniting with Morrie for their Tuesday conversations, Mitch is able to begin to remember his passions and to rethink what he is doing with his life.<br />The story that is told in this book is of a man who was a hero to his family, friends, colleagues, and strangers around the world. Morrie's life was a journey that he embraced with love, joy, and determination until his last breath. He chose to share his dieing experience with others just as he had shared his knowledge as a professor for so many years. Always a giver Morrie did not hide his pain or his passions.<br />Through Mitch, Morrie leaves us with key thoughts that he wanted all of us to remember. These key ideas were the guides by which he had lived his life and had found his happiness and success. The messages are simple and clear. It is up to the reader and the author to take heed and find ways to follow them.<br />The ending comments by Mitch Albom were inspiring to this teacher and student. <br />Thank you Mitch for sharing Morrie's teaching us.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I really don't understand why I enjoyed this movie.  I'm not a huge Trek person, but I have more than a passing knowledge of it.  I've seen most of the series, but I gave up with Voyager and the new Enterprise series.  Still, I usually will go to see a Trek film in the theater.  Not this time though.  I had heard that Nemesis was terrible and avoided spending money on it.  I finally broke down and rented it from Netflix (hey, I pay the monthly fee, why not).  <BR>I guess since I went into it with such low expectation, I was actually entertained.  I was less disappointed with this than I was with the Matrix 2&amp;3 (although, to be fair, being in the sci-fi genre is about the only thing those to franchises share in common).  It may also be that I'm so far removed from my days of watching TNG that I'm not enamored with the characters anymore.  Either way, I was surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did.<BR>I can understand why hardcore Trekkies (by the way, that is an awesome documentary!!) might hate this film though.
B00006879E|4.0|With an interesting sound, Maroon 5 has quickly infiltrated the airwaves and music video channels with songs from their album \\"songs for jane.\\"  Adam Levine's voice is hard to describe: it's somewhere between whiny and soulful, but in a good way.  His voice sounds amazing on \\"Secret\\" and \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" because the background music is muted just enough to let his strong vocal personality through.  Their funky beats are catchy and are most evident on songs: \\"Harder to Breathe,\\" \\"This Love,\\" and \\"Not Coming Home.\\"  The first two cuts, Harder to Breathe and This Love give the band more of a rock sound that proves to be a little deceptive because the rest of the album is quite different from these two songs.  <br />\\"She will be loved\\" is my favorite song from the album: it is a slower, more dramatic song in which Levine's emotion is shown through his aching vocals.  \\"Look for the girl with the broken smile; ask her if she wants to stay awhile...\\" \\"The Sun\\" and \\"Sunday Morning\\" sound sort of jazzy and breezy.  In fact, \\"Sunday Morning\\" reminded me a bit of Jamiroquai's Virtual Insanity--with the piano and high notes.  \\"Shiver\\" is a great song that, I think, shows the band's style perfectly: strong guitar, soulful vocals, and a rock/pop quality that is bettered by few in this genre.  There are some moments that could be improved, but overall this is a solid first effort.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|As a man, let me just say this and get it out of the way: yes, this is a \\"chick flick.\\" Too bad the director pandered more to sentimentality and notions of \\"sisterhood\\" than sticking to the foundation of the story's core roots, i.e. conformism, traditionalism, consumerism, and how they shaped the modern American woman.<br />I thought Mona Lisa Smile could've been a lot more than what it was. Julia Roberts plays an idealistic art professor who goes to the most prestigious woman's university in America to \\"reform\\" the university's way of teaching and in turn the way of the students' thinking. Roberts is a cardboard character. The audience is meant to identify with her forward thinking character in the backwards 1950s. She is an independent, rebellious woman, too busy fighting for women's independence to see what she really wants. <br />Unfortunately all the other \\"girls\\" in the film aren't much more original. Each one of the four student \\"girlfriends\\" we follow represents in almost cookie cutter form the key roles middle and upper class women were allowed to play in the 1950s: free thinking, sexually promiscuous bohemian, rigid house wife who stands by her man, career driven yet unable to balance career with family, and the ugly duckling who finds self esteem and thus a man. The scenes with the college students played like a bad Lifetime movie. However, the classroom scenes had a bit of a twist on the usual Hollywood standard of \\"smart teacher reforms troubled kids\\" where Roberts was instead a \\"free thinking teacher that counsels conformist kids.\\"  The best scene of the film is where Robert's turns the class around from a bunch of book-memorizing snobs into women who really examine who they are and how they are perceived.<br />The DVD has very few special features. The standard interviews where the actors talk about the movie is spent mainly discussing the role women played in the 1950s and how society and a consumer culture dictated a lot of those roles. No one really talked about their characters. Probably because the characters weren't that interesting. All-in-all Mona Lisa Smile interesting as a look at mid-20th century middle to upper-class women, but as a movie with engrossing characters and a powerful plot it fails miserably.
B000002J1Y|4.0|May be a little much if you're not REALLY into Yes, but if you are a hardcore fan, this will be just the tonic.  Great jams and outstanding work on most of the tunes.  The Stravinski intro is canned, though, and not very audible.  On most albums you're lucky to get two or three really good cuts, and this one has six, in my opinion. (Khatru, Sunrise, All good people, Starship, And You and I, Runaround)
0743455967|5.0|This is a little gem of a how-to book.  It's little, because Stephen King has taken seriously the commands of Strunk and White to &quot;omit needless words&quot;.  He also rails against the excessive use of adverbs (&quot;adverbs are not your friends&quot;), the temptation to &quot;dress up&quot; plain and more direct language (&quot;this is like dressing up your dog; the dog is embarassed and the person who engaged in this premeditated act of cuteness should be more embarassed&quot;--I'm paraphrasing), and writing untruthfully about subjects with which you are uneducated (&quot;if you're a plumber, write about plumbing; God knows why, but people love books about work&quot;).<br />Other than that, King offers few hard and fast rules.  The most important commands are to write often and to read often.  His book is funny, wise and above all inspiring.  It contains words of wisdom from an imaginative man who made his living doing something that he still absolutely revels in doing.  How many people can say that?<br />This book also contains two autobiographical sections and a reading list.  The first autobiographical section deals with his childhood and early adulthood as a young husband, father, English teacher, writer and pauper.  It is both funny and sad.  The second section deals with the accident that nearly killed him in 1999.  This part is less funny and more sad, but contains a fundamental truth:  his passion for writing, at least in part, saved him.<br />There is also a sweetness about the way King feels about his wife.  He clearly adores her and is still in love and lust with her after all these years.  She is his &quot;ideal reader&quot;, the person he writes all of his books with her opinion in mind.  She is smart, outspoken, and nearly idolized by King.  What woman wouldn't want a man to feel that way about her?  Tabitha King is a lucky woman.<br />If this book doesn't make you want to jump up and write (and read) something, then you're not a writer.  Even if you're not, you can still enjoy the wickedly wise tales of King's childhood and his astute, self-deprecating look at the world of bad versus good, and sometimes great, writing.f you're not, you can still enjoy the wickedly wise tales of King's childhood and his astute, self-deprecating look at the world of bad versus good, and sometimes great, writing.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With cornell singing and morello, wilk, commerford playing how could you loose? Soundgarden was one of the best bands of the 90's along with Rage Against the Machine...actually i dont know they were a little too political BUT THEY STILL KICKED @$$! Audioslave is bringing hardrock back to what it was. even the slower songs are sick, i especially like &quot;shaddow of the sun&quot; where cornell starts off singing and ends screaming his head off. overall i highly recomend this album to any rock fan
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Toxic and Everytime are about the only decent Songs on this album...I really like Britney...I really do, but she could have just dont better on this album.  I liked her &quot;Britney&quot; album, and its still in my CD player to this day..Love Ya Britney...But try harder next time...
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Josh Homme is clearly a man caught inside the boundaries of pitiful music. Fortunately, he has the ammunition of creativity to blow up those boundaries and tap dance on the rubble. Eagles Of Death Metal may not be for all, but it is certainly for some. Track 1 opens with the racing \\"I Only Want You,\\" inclining listeners to take off their pants and dance. The next 4 tracks build from there, killer riffs, pounding drum beats, and smooooooooooth vocals. By track 5 or 6, you're sweating and looking for love. This album seems like its on its way to a 5 star rating until it gets bogged down by 2 tracks in the middle which could have been left off. Granted, they're good, but they aren't needed. In essence, they weaken the album, instead of fortifying it. But after the speed bump, its time to thrust her back into 5th gear and hit the gas pedal. The album switches gears towards the final 1/3 and smacks us with a bit of blues/bluegrass, surfer/beachy, and my personal favorite...A 1:57 RIPPING satanic ho-down. Think of hell, and think of satan, playing a ho-down, and his disciples chanting...then breaking it down and TOTALLY letting loose. \\"Kiss The Devil.\\" Clearly one of my top songs off the album. Also included is \\"Stuck In The Metal,\\" a cool little \\"Stuck In The Middle\\" cover by Stealers Wheel. All in all, a very cool sexy album. Nothing sounds like this, and its definately worth checking out. I'd give it 5 stars, but like i said, it got a little bogged down in the middle...so it gets a 4 star rating. My opinion on these guys is that they have this fun loving, pimpy, peace, hippy style album cover and pictures and whatnot...yet, i think they're masking the devil behind it all. I think there are songs on here that are FILTHY...DIRTY....EVIL...yet, because Homme has such a smooth melodic voice, you don't realize that you're being lured into hell. Thats the best part...its like a door, painted brilliant colors of yellow, blue, and purple, and behind that door, is the devil, waiting for you with open arms.<BR>Buy it, live it, feel it, be it<BR>Eagles of F'n Death Metal<BR>Sexy Sexy!
B000066NW0|4.0|When I first saw avril lavigne's &quot;complicated&quot; video I found it to be completely stupuid for a young girl in all punk attire to be singing a pop song. Then I listened to more of her songs that weren't singles and they were actually good songs. As years past her music began to grow on me. I learned a lot about her and came up with the idea in order for her to get a record deal she probably had to create a facade of a punk rocker. Though she has seemed to have dropped this look and become more grown up as her music has. I think if Avril Lavigne lost her punk look she would be a much better artist beacuse her music is actually likeable.
B00018D3RI|4.0|It's funny when I saw this new boxed set released to coincide with the new COMEDY Tribute film, &quot;Starsky and Hutch: The Movie&quot; I was taken back to days of playing cops and robbers with my friends in the local park.<br />Beyond the main characters and the really COOL car my memories about the particular episodes were fuzzy to say the least.  Thank goodness I bought this set though as over the past few nights as I review each episode I can see exactly why I loved this show so much as a youngster.<br />You have to remember when (what era) this show was filmed in...some of the clothes are certainly dated, but when I look in clothing store windows in Toronto I see alot of retro styles that could easily have been in an episode or two... You have to get beyond all the supposedly rich &quot;bad guys&quot; wearing &quot;Herb Tarlic&quot;-test pattern suits though.<br />Unlike the new movie, the old stories are very serious, and fairly well written (Michael &quot;Miami Vice&quot; Mann wrote several episodes) although TV critics today would probably disagree about the quality of the shows.  The humour (exagerated in the movie, although it is very entertaining too!) comes from the banter and chemistry between the two lead actors, but does not overshadow the fact that this is a show about a couple of hard nosed cops.<br />The quality of the DVD transfer is excellent, and most of the DVD extras although sparse (I too would have liked audio commentaries) are well done.  The one about the car collector is a bit ridiculous though (it's quite obvious this man was ripped off as the car he proposes to be an ORIGINAL, has the wrong mirrors and a terrible paint job)  I would have expected the new movie car to be used for a documentary on the &quot;Third star&quot; of the series.  The movie one is a Beautiful restoration of a classic 70's icon and big American muscle car.<br />If you liked this series when you were younger, I believe you'll enjoy this walk down yours and TV history's memory lane...Watch for the continuity errors though (see the pool scene in the pilot)...they're everywhere!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|When Radiohead began to explore electronic textures on Kid A, it fell to upstart U.K. bands such as Coldplay, Travis, Starsailor and Muse to provide the world with disconsolate, Pink Floyd-worthy guitar rock. So give Muse, from the English town of Teignmouth, some credit for adopting Radiohead's bombastic Bends approach and adding prog-rock-style instrumental virtuosity. &quot;Apocalypse Please,&quot; the turbulent opening cut, is stitched with almost Liberace-esque piano pounding and fluttering guitar arpeggios. - Rob Kemp
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX Where it all Begins Again the most hyped and look forward to wrestlemania of all time does it live up to the hype build up being the 20th WM and in MSG? It does live up to being one of the best WM but falls short to living up to it's build mostly cause of Brock Lesner vs Goldburg which was a dream match everyone look forward to since Goldburg came back and it turn out to be an upset but not the wrost match for Goldburg, I look back at Starrcade 1998 in WCW the Nash vs Goldburg was hyped just like this at lest this had a fare ending to it unlike that match so i don't think this is a bad match for a Goldburg match but i would say this is a weak match for Brock since hes has classic 5 star matchs with Kurt Angle and Eddie, and soild ones with Undertaker and many other wwe superstars, The ending was pretty cool with Stone Cold that really helped get the people into it=o) Other then that match Wrestlemania XX is an awesome event that will go down an history i think, alot of great matchs the best being the Main event which i think is the second best WM main event of all time 1st being Bret Hart vs HBK at WM12 Awesome match with Chris Benoit make Triple H tape out for the first time i can remaber just awesome ending with all 3 guys giving it there all, Also Kurt Angle vs Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Chapionship was great as well not a classic but very close to one great win for Eddie at the biggist Stage of them all, Finally Eddie and Benoit get there push and it happs at the biggest Wrestlemania, Also Undertaker returns against Kane in a solid match although it was awesome to see paul bear and unertaker coming out to his old music it was disspoiting to see undertakers ring attire being a take top other then that it was a wrestlemania moment i think, Also Rock&Sock vs Evloution in a very fun match that felt like a big WM match up and it deliverd but Sad ending if The rock and Mick foley one it would of been a WM moment it still is for Randy Orton but the fanswanted Rock&Sock to win and so did I:o) But still it was a great match and so was Y2J vs christian, And also John Cena vs Big Show for the US title in the 2nd best WM opener only to Bret vs Owen at WMX, Overall WMXX in my view is the best if not one of the best WMs yet.<BR>              Heres my rating from 1-10<br />             John Cena vs Big Show (8)<BR>           Raw tag team championships (6)<BR>              Y2J vs Christian (8)<BR>              Rock&Sock vs Evlotion (8)<BR>             Sable&torrie vs Stacy&Jakie (for men that wanna see girls in there underware then(10)but for a wrestling match (5)<br />              Goldburg vs Brock Lesner (6) (this is Brocks last match at lest for awhile that is im sure a good resone why it was not as good)<BR>                  Cruiserwight open (7/) (alot of highlights in this match but was over too fast)<BR>             Smackdowns tag team match (6)<BR>              Molly vs Victory (4) (Seeing molly get her head shave is a WM moment i suppose.)<br />                 Eddie Vs Angle (9) (Awesome match!! not a classic but close)<br />                Undetaker Vs Kane (7/) WM moment seeing Taker back with paul bear just ring attire was a let down match was still solid good win for Taker now 12-0 at WM thats awesome!!!)             <br />           Triple Threat World Championship match Shawn Michaels vs Chris Benoit vs Triple H (10) One of the best matchs I have ever seen theres only like 5 matchs that i think are wroth of a 10 and that is Bret vs HBK at WM12 1996 and HBK vs Razor Romon in a ladder match at Summerslam 1995 and Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle at Royal Rumble 2003 and Bret vs Owen at WMX 1994 and this triple threat Match at WMXX 2004 so thats saying alot about this match maybe not everyone will agree with me but thoughs are my favorit matchs and this match ranks 2nd place for me with HBK and Bret hart being number 1 this is a match that will be talked about for years a classic finally Benoit is the Champion after coming so close at Royal Rumble 2003 Benoit has one the Big one at the biggest event and biggest stage WMXX Awesome Match with a wrestlemania moment with Eddie and Benoit huging and celebrating in the Ring as it all begins for them finally!!!) <br />        Overall i give WMXX a 9 out of 10
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This was the Ryan Adams I started with and it's still one of my favorites.  Its absolutely brilliant, the music, the songwriting everything.  Some people have said that it sounds over-produced, but I disagree.  It is definately more polished than Heartbreaker, but the songwriting is so passionate, vulnerable and poetic that that doesn't even really matter. <br />He switches styles a lot throughout the album, and it speaks to his immense talent that he's able to do it so seemingly effortlessly and effectively.  Not all the songs are sad, but some (La Ciegena just smiled, Somehow Someday, Harder now that its over) can be depressing.  My personal favorite is New York, and despite the deceptively fast pace, its a melancholy song about lost love.  He's been criticized for being too prolific and putting too many average songs on his albums, but some of the songs that I didn't care for at first really grew on me, and there tends to be a lot of disagreement as to which are good songs and which are the bad songs.  I would say buy it and form your own opinions.<br />Highly recommended!  It's a brillaint sixties-sounding rock album but with alt-country influences still present.  This and Stranger's Almanac from Whiskeytown contains some of the best music ever.  I love this album and am waiting for Ryan to make another one that is this good.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I know that is is hard to follow in the footsteps of a movie like the first matrix, but I still feel it could have been better.<br />I will start with the good.  The visuals were stunning as before.  They created some interesting new characters:  the sentient programs, though I found for the most part, poorly acted, were an interesting idea, the upgraded agents, the new replicating agent smith, and SOME of the members of ZION.  There were some good action sequences, the burly fight was pointless as you can get but entertaining, the car and bike chase sequence was nothing short of heart stopping, and I liked Trinity's invasion of the power plant.<br />That sums it up for the good.<br />The bad:  Zion was wasted, aside from a few characters it just wasn't that interesting.  The speech Morpheus gave before the rave just wasn't that well written, and the rave was stupid.  The fight sequences weren't as well done as they were in the first movie.  They lacked the interesting group of protagonists, no Cypher, no Mouse, no Tank or Dozer.  I understand they were either dead or estranged from the producers, but they could have replaced them with some better ones than they had.  Jada Pinket Smith looked cool, but was ultimately wasted.  The keymaster was a good concept but played out really dull.  The movie had a feel that it wasn't really cohesive, like it was a collection of sequences or images rather than a movie.<br />All in all it wasn't a bad movie.  But it wasn't great.  it wasn't something you want to watch over and over again, or if you did you hit the forward on the dvd player to skip over the many slow or ineffective parts.<br />Maybe the Wachowski's should have filmed this, then taken another five years to do the next one.  Because it felt a bit rushed, and the final was obviously rushed and horribly thought out.<br />all in all<BR>not bad
B0000CDLA7|5.0|After Six Degrees, I wasn't sure Dream Theater could outdo themselves again. Well, they did...<br />This album isn't Awake II or Metropolis III or much like anything else they've ever made, and that's a good thing. Rather than create more of the same (not that there was anything wrong with they've done in the past), DT has again redefined what they do and turned their astounding musicianship in to creating a pure-metal album. It even says on their website that it was inspired by Master of Puppets. Indeed, this album is heavier, angrier and more raw than anything else they've ever produced. While James LaBrie has never had quite the gusto in his voice to compete with the likes of James Hetfield, he does do a convincing job of passing himself off as a metal singer.<br />Petrucci's guitar work this time around is just insane, and this is where the album shines. No longer does his ability take a backseat to any sort of artistic vision. No, this time the guitar goes for the throat, with heavy, catchy riffs, ultra-technical transition passages, and a couple of solos that had my jaw drooping a couple inches from the floor.<br />Lest you take it that this is a mindless guitar-chops-fest, I can assure you that the songwriting is here. Rather than write  esoteric storylines that only appeal to those which are willing to read the lyric sheet over and over to understand them, they went with vocals that are more down-to-earth... not to mention angry as hell. Apparently Mike Portnoy has some issues with his father, and Petrucci is a bit pissed off at the prevalence of religious extremism. These are lyrics that you'll be singing along with and actually CARING about.<br />In short, Train of Thought is a great addition to any Dream Theater fan's collection, and it's close enough to the mainsteam that it could even be the album that finally nets DT the large fanbase that they definitely deserve.
0743243307|4.0|Readers of this book will not be disappointed with their time invested in this wonderful and poignant story of an arranged Bengali marriage and her life in the projects of London. The story is not writ large but a personal story told through the passage of years as Nazneen,the Bengali bride, learns the ways of her new husband, who is under employed and seemingly adrift in a society he does not enjoy. His fantasy life about his station in life causes friction between him and his wife. The story is charming and poignant. The author has done a brilliant job bringing this family to life.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Almost 25 years have passed since these guys started releasing albums.  I've been a fan since 1984.  So 'Powerslave' is still my absolute favorite, although I know in my heart that 'Piece of Mind' and 'The Number of the Beast' are better albums.  Both 'Brave New World' and 'Dance of Death' I tend to rank right below this trilogy of masterpieces.  If five years apart from Bruce and 10 years apart from Adrian were needed to bring about this renaissance for the band then so be it.  These guys are smokin' again.  I think I was more disappointed when Adrian left the band then when Bruce left, simply because by the 90's it was obvious that Bruce had to do his own thing.  I've always been a huge fan of Adrian's songwriting.  The evidence of his greatness on this album is obvious - 'Wildest Dreams', 'Paschendale', 'Journeyman' and the underrated 'Face in the Sand' are all top-notch tracks.  The album standout though is 'Rainmaker' - by far Dave's best writing credit.  And Janick's 'Dance of Death' title track again illustrates how much of a worthy member of the band he is.  With Adrian's departure, I did not care for this guy in the band, but he's proven to be a great songwriter over the years.  Now we have both him and Adrian - could it be any better?  The album does have a few weak tracks - 'Gates of Tomorrow', 'New Frontier' and 'Age of Innocence' - but a weak track by Iron Maiden is still a pretty good song.  Buy it - this album cannot disappoint.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie was so fun for my entire family. Probably the most enjoyable movie of the year. The storyline was very solid and the characters were captivating. I laughed out loud while watching this film and you will too. This is a must buy for a Jack Nicholson fan and for any fan of excellent comedy that actually has an excellent storyline to go along with the laughs.
0316666343|3.0|This book may not be print perfect, there are a few typos and the language structure is sometimes lacking, but I found this book a good read.<br />It begins quite brutally and because the victim is writing from her point of view, 'dead in heaven', the actual rape is quite hard to read through.  <br />I found the book a struggle until about the middle, I almost put it down, but I kept on reading and finally finished the book.  The ending really gives you something.  It's a hard book, not from the point of view of the reading, but the coming to terms!<br />Hope you enjoy this book, I eventually did!
B00005T30L|5.0|There are great films. And then there are those that touch you on a genuinely personal level.Ghost World is that film. It's a small film that won't mean as much to many people. But those that do &quot;get it&quot; will find it endlessly touching and filled with magical moments.There is no major plot, or big climax in Ghost World.It feels more like an emotional vignette of what it feels to be lost and lonely.And it captures that feeling so perfectly,with such feeling, that you'll get shivers down your spine.<br />Perhaps this film feels so real thanks to the amazing acting and writing.Thora Birch captured her lead role absolutely perfectly.Her character doesn't really give you any reasons to sympathize with her, and at first glance, there don't seem to be many redeeming qualities about her. But she is so refreshingly human, and realistically flawed, that you can't help but feel for her.Thora Birch gives Enid dimension and range, sculpting something so much more true to life than your typical &quot;angst ridden teen&quot;.Scarlett Johansson nails her part as the more &quot;normal&quot; best friend. It's very rare than an actor with such minimal screen time is able to flesh so much dimension into her character.But that is just what she does, making every single moment of screentime with her priceless.Everything from her mannerisms, to the inflections in her voice make her a pleasure to watch.But it is Steve Buscemi,who is at the emotional core of this film, who creates one of the most real,and wonderful, and sympathetic on screen characters that I've ever seen.His performance in the film rendered me speechless-it was heartbraking and humorous at the same time.Lets not forget the superb collection of eclectic rock,jazz and blues tunes to be found in the film.And the film's score,the theme song for Ghost World was just extraordinary and added such emotion to the film. The script is abolsutely brilliant without sounding over the top.It still sounds like things people would actually say, and the fact that it manages to be so infinitely striking is a testemanet to its brilliance.The sets and costumes were also simply delightful and added a vigorous and zestful feel to the movie.The sets and costumes, and the overall appearance of the movie is simply unforgettable.And the film is endlessly witty,offering you an internal chuckle every step of the way.<br />But perhaps what touched me about this movie the most was that it allowed itself to be so real and vulnerable.It never tried to glamorize, or make being an outcast or a lonely person seem cool like so many other brainless movies catered to a young audience have.It wasn't afarid of being emotional,and striking a chord with the viewer. And believe what you like, but this movie is by no means a &quot;teen&quot; movie.It is a deeply intelligent, and profoundly moving film that most teens wouldn't take the time to understand.The film may mislead you into thinking of it as a teen movie because it stars two teenage girls in the leads, but don't for one second assume that this is the case.Ghost World is a movie that is undefinable.You cant't recommend it to a certain age group,or a certain film preference.This film is catered to your emotions.You either feel it or you don't.Subtle,touching,full of dry wit,and deep beyond explanation Ghost World is a film that can be watched and watched and watched and watched...
0440180295|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut is an author whom I became intimately familiar with for a few years. I read, literally, every single work of fiction that he has had published, and generally enjoyed them, as well. However, it seems that Vonnegut is also the type of author that one outgrows: I re-read Slaughterhouse Five in its entirety some two months ago, and have not been more frustrated (and tired) by a book in quite a while. The biggest issue with Vonnegut is, no matter what else is to be said: He is formulaic. After a while, all of his stories bleed together, his cynicism is tiresome, and his misanthropy becomes cliche.<br />Period.<br />Slaughterhouse Five is often hailed as Vonnegut's piece de resistane, though I sincerely doubt it was written as such. It deals primarily with a man, Billy Pilgrim, who continually experiences changes and &quot;jumps&quot; in time: He does not experience a linear sense of time. Pilgrim fought in World War II, and is subsequently kidnapped by Trafalmadorians, an alien race who also do not experience linear time.<br />This book has been championed as an anti-war novel, though to be honest, I never quite saw this. Does Vonnegut speak down on war? Most assuredly. But I think this book extends far, far past simply being an anti-war novel: In fact, I think the theme of &quot;anti-war&quot; is perhaps the one theme which is least prominant in the book.<br />Truth be told, perhaps to others the literary merits of this novel shine through, but I personally believe there are far more intriguing, thought provoking, and funny books by Vonnegut out there. Mother Night and The Sirens of Titan, to name two. Slaughterhouse Five is worth reading for its supposed literary merit, but it seems to me that it is a sophomoric work of Vonnegut's: Its ideas are there, and they are far, far below the surface.
0141439831|4.0|William Makepeace Thackeray was a wonderfully insightful and intelligent rabble-rouser.  In this tale he converses with his reader in a gossipy tone and with spectacular wit.  He also reveals to his readers truths of the era through his dissection of Victorian society from all angles; lowly peasant to regal heights.  As a modern philosopher of his own society during the Victorian era, Thackeray is utterly charming.<br /><br />Vanity Fair must have been a phenomenon not unlike `Sex and the City' which debuted over a decade ago on HBO television.  Vanity Fair, when it was released, was released in \\"monthly numbers\\" for over 1 1/2 years in periodical format.  Readers were drawn to the lives of Becky and Amelia because of their scandalous behaviour and their readers had no quips about producing their hard-earned pounds to read of what would ultimately become of these two fascinating and rather naughty girls.  Purposely suspenseful plots \\"hooked\\" the London public.  Thackeray became a star amongst the literati supreme of London.  By inserting himself, his thoughts and views of England, as well as the nature of man, war, poverty and these spruiks about the boastful aristocratic society into the work, he presents himself and his own opinions to the world through this wonderful book, Vanity Fair.<br /><br />This novel is as important today as it was when it was released, especially for those who studying historical life as it was from day to day.  We are given plain and simple viewpoints on the somewhat normal, the fashionable, the destitute and the poverty striken women of the era.  Very interesting, always charming and just an all around splendid read--albeit a very long one.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Cher has been singing for over 40 years and she did it very good and I think that she'll continue doing it. So in 2002 she decided to start what it was going to be her Farewell Tour.<BR>This show is similar as her 2000 Believe Tour but with more production and quality (with this I'm not saying that it was bad, it was very good actually but this is way much better).<BR>On this show you can see Cher performing all her hits plus others that were on the program but weren't added to the final cut of the concert that was recorded in the American Airlines Arena in Miami Beach. As every Cher show you'll see lots of costumes changing, specail effects, lots of dancers and all Cher's Extravaganza. She has been very clever doing it now that she can do it very good without showing weakness of any kind.<BR>Some of the songs here are her #1's &quot;Gypsies, tramps and thieves&quot;, &quot;Dark lady&quot;, &quot;Half-breed&quot; and &quot;Believe&quot; plus her other hits like &quot;If I could turn back time&quot;, &quot;Just like Jesse James&quot;, &quot;I found someone&quot; and &quot;Song for the lonely&quot;.<BR>She covered once again as the opening number U2's &quot;I still  haven't found what I'm looking for&quot; (which honestly sounds better on her).<BR>And finally among the special features you'll find the new &quot;If I could turn back time&quot; video, 3 extra live songs, Cher's special version of West Side Story (not big deal) and behind the scenes.<BR>Very good Cher you did it again.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Secretary is not your average romantic comedy to say the least.But that's what makes it so refreshing.It actually shows us that the sweetest love can blossom from people that you would deem \\"wierd\\" in everyday life.And that's what I think this film accomplishes the very best-taking \\"wierd\\" people that in the cinematic world (and unfortunately in the real one too)are either ignored, or made fun of, and it fleshes them into real people.Real people that you can like,admire,and respect.It shows us that despite their \\"alternative\\" lifestyles, they are people not much different from your average joe.I walked away from this film with admiration for how sensitively the subject of s&m was handled.Usually, it's a great opportunity for ridicule, but here, the characters were CHARACTERS, and not caricatures.You walk away from this film feeling warm, and delighted, not uncomfortable like you may assume.<br />The pacing is perfect, and Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance was simply excellent and totally transforming.A truly magical role that lit up the screen, I truly felt she was this girl.James Spader also worked well as Gyllenhaal's crazed,neurotic boss.<br />If you don't mind films that are a little strange, then check out Secretary.Not only does it have great performances, and and undeniably orginal concept,it successfully pulls you into an entirely different world-and you stay there 'till the end.
0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead has, in one way or another, generally found its way into the hands of must [psuedo]intellectuals. While many people have qualms about the &quot;philosophy&quot; of objectivism, The Fountainhead is a shining example of Rand's &quot;real-world&quot; (albeit fictionalized) philosophy in action.<br />The protagonist and center of the story is Howard Roark, an architecht. Throughout his career, he refuses to compromise his own integrity, creativity, or desires under the will of others. Such is the ideal of Rand, who, in objectivism, champions logic over emotion, rationality over irrationality. Roark embodies these traits, and as a result, is met with either applaud or with sneers. This book is many things to many people: To some, Roark is an uncompromising fool, a weak man. To others, (myself included), Roark is a pillar of strength and the definition of, quite literally, what it means to be a man.<br />The Fountainhead, much like most of Rand's fiction (that is, Atlas Shrugged) is also an exercise in patience. While Rand's underlying ideas are most assuredly worth the time it takes to get through them (her tomes tend to stretch from 600 - 1000 pagse). This is, to be frank, the largest drawback to this book - a drawback severe enough to merit the dreaded four stars instead of five. Rand could have convincingly boiled down The Fountainhead to about one third of its original size. For whatever reason unbeknownst to me, she most evidently did not -- hence, you have either a remarkable testament to the triumph of man, or a doorstop.<br />Your choice.<br />If you are looking for a &quot;cheap and easy&quot; way to introduce yourself to Objectivism, then I suggest you look at the ARI's webpage or the various volumes on just objectivism. However, the most important service The Fountainhead provides is as an example of objectivism: It is the humanity of the story, which supports objectivism, which has the ability to convince a reader of the merits of objectivism. The intellectual searching for something to chew on will happily find it nestled in the pages of The Fountainhead..

B000089CJI|4.0|It's amazing. Back when groups like New Order, Joy Division, and Depeche Mode were discovering that they could create a new kind of folk music with their Yamaha DX-7's, I had no love for their music. I thought it cold and processed, and instead turned toward the even more cold and processed sound of glam metal (although my love of the Replacements, Billy Joel, and the Pretenders kepy my soul from turning to lead).<br />But now, I'm not so sure. I'm fascinated by &quot;Give Up&quot; from the Postal Service, which is mostly programmed electronica/synth music heavily inspired by Erasure and New Order. The vocals are compelling but still oddly distanced - there's no outbreak of blue-eyed soul, and everyone pretty much sings as if they're afraid to color outside the lines. But against all odds, &quot;Give Up&quot; is a very moving and stirring collection of tunes.<br />My faves are &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,&quot; a hauntingly atmospheric opener; &quot;Sleeping In,&quot; which has such thoughtfully wry humor; &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes,&quot; a sort of semi-paranoid apocalyptic tale; and the furious closer &quot;Natural Anthem.&quot; But there are gems everywhere, and I think it's because The Postal Service brings a strong human touch to their music. You can hear it in the passion lurking behind the staid vocals, and in the thrilling inclusions of instruments (a guitar here, drums there) that pepper the arrangements.<br />I rate &quot;Give Up&quot; 4 stars, mostly because I'm still coming to terms with it (does this mean I have to like Depeche Mode now? I don't wanna like Depeche Mode). But I will probably upgrade that to 5 stars soon, because this is pretty amazing - and transcendent - music.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Every gang in the city must be looking for us! An understatement if I've ever heard one. From the moment the opening \\"Warriors\\" logo appears and the train sequence starts, I still feel a rush of adrenaline run through me. A sleeper hit from 1979 and highly controversial at the time, the \\"Warriors\\" is definitely a cult classic with an enormous following. It's too bad that some of the original opening scenes on the \\"Warriors\\" turf are still missing even in this Director's Cut DVD version.     For the Director's cut DVD the picture has been remastered, it's crystal clear and the newly upgraded sound is a definite improvement over the previous DVD release. Given its memorable soundtrack it should have always been in 5.1 Dolby Digital. In my opinion the new 5.1 soundtrack definitely enhances the fight and chase scenes as well as the overall mood of the film. To this day my favorite scenes are still the chase with the Turnbull AC's and the memorable fight with the Baseball Furies, these guys were very menacing looking and they swung a mean bat.     It appears that Paramount Studios finally convinced Walter Hill to revisit his work and make some needed upgrades for the fans. The Director's Cut now contains an introduction and some extra frames giving the movie a comic book feel in certain scenes. The special features this time around include four short documentaries; basically one documentary broken into four parts. Also included are interviews with Director Walter Hill, actors Michael Beck, James Remar, David Patrick Kelly, and Deborah Van Valkenburgh. The DVD includes In-depth descriptions of how the movie evolved and are recounted by the producer, cinematographer, costume designer, stunt coordinator and many others.     After 29 years of repeated viewing, this movie is still a classic for me and worthy of a place in my DVD collection. I've never seen another gang film like the \\"Warriors\\" and I give it 5 stars for pure entertainment. You \\"Warriors\\" are good, real good!DVD Special Features:   Widescreen Version   Enhanced for 16:9 TVs   Dolby Digital: English 5.1   English 2.0   Subtitles   Introduction by Walter Hill   4 Featurettes:   The Beginning, Battleground, The Phenomenon, Original Theatrical Trailer    The Warriors:  Michael Beck....

B00006GEXR|5.0|&quot;About a Boy&quot; is the best movie I have seen Hugh Grant in.  He plays a single man whose seen his friends get married and have children.

B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby's PLAY is one of the CDs which an artist makes exactly one time. It is an album which transcends musical boundries and genres, combining jazz, classical, blues, R&amp;B, electronic and ambient into a swirling eddy of creative genius. This is one of the all-around strongest musical efforts I have experienced: Every track is significant, and every piece moves fluidly from one song to the next.<br />This is a stand-alone CD by Moby, as well. The rest of his musical repretoire is talanted, and he has shown that he is continually re-inventing his musical style. However, it seems to me that 18 is just an attempt to &quot;re-work&quot; Play: It doesn't come off properly.<br />The first twelve tracks on this album are genuine Moby: They are guitar and drum, jazz and blues. My personal favorite is &quot;Run On,&quot; which is track 11: Its lively piano and catchy rhythm (cliche) are what initially introduced me to this album. The last six tracks are more ambient, with Moby exploring pure instrumentals.<br />What makes this album so magnificant is the impression that Moby had an absolute ball producing it. It shines through how much he enjoyed making the music on this album, and as a result, it has received much attention. Any lover of any genre of music is sure to enjoy Play: It is an excellent piece of musical artistry.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Simply put, this album is an auditory experience, one so amazing that it will leave an impression on so many levels. Absolution is what Rock and Roll has been missing for many years. The passion and emotion of just letting go in a whirlwind of sounds.<br />I sat down to write this because I feel that Muse is such a powerful band and I believe this album deserves recognition. It is my hope that you would read this and consider downloading or buying this album. Maybe it will move you as much as it has me, or maybe not, but I at least believe you should give Absolution a serious shot.<br />From the beginning with the marching and statements of the end of the world in &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot; to the lowest of lows with &quot;Blackout&quot; back to the self-declaration/motivation in &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot; all coming to a rest at an uneventful and serene end with &quot;Ruled by Secrecy&quot;. It is like a rollercoster of aural perception. It's just amazing.<BR>Matt Bellamy's voice hits every range while still flowing with the songs so perfectly, creating an underlying tone and emotion to every track.The technical skill of each band member is shown time and time again in an incredible display of pure unadulterated rock.<br />Nearly every song on this work of art stirs my soul, making me want to sing along, to scream out in a defiant roar. It is euphoria for the ears and adrenaline for the body. It's epic, it's grand, it's beautiful, it's pretentous, and it's over the top. And it's that that I believe makes Absolution great rock. It's the kind of music you long for, the musical experience at it's best.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard Bring Me To Life in the motion Picture Daredevil, I knew I had to learn out the name of the song and who the group was. I then immediately bought the CD, and at first I was just interested in Bring Me to Life, but when I heard My Immortal, followed by the rest of the tracks on the CD, I knew then I definitely got my money's worth. At when I downloaded the band version of My Immortal (from the group's music video) I knew that Evanescence and Amy Lee were very talented and that they would definitely be making it big, and their presence athe music awards was definitely felt. I definitely give this CD and the band 5 stars for their incredible music, the soulful and deep lyrics, and Amy Lee's unbelievable voice.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Come Away With Me, in my opinion, is more than deserving of all its critical acclaim and grammies. I'd like to know the last time an immensely talented musician, like Norah Jones, was able to make their hard work pay off in the mainstream music industry, especially when relying only on a grassroots constituency and not mass-market product placement. This album affected people, who told their friends and neighbors about it, who in turn told their friends and neighbors about it, and so on and so forth. This form of marketing may be beneficial to some extent, but never would one assume it to have such an enormous effect as Come Away With Me did. 19 million albums were sold! So this leaves one thing unmentioned, the music. Nothing in the world sells 19 million copies unless it is something of great vitality, creativity, substance and seminality. And Norah Jone's debut recording is all that and then some. Through the wistful grandeur of these pithy songs, an aura of loss and cresfallenness is translated to make one feel more at home, more in love and more alive. In a panoply of pensive reveries, lilting gravitas and a fey-voiced warble, Norah Jones poignantly conveys the light side of the dark, the hope in the loss and the joy in the pain. Like an elixir of life, Come Away With Me transports humanity for 45 indelible minutes, swallowing your senses and enveloping your heart. I know not of another modern recording that possesses the eminent qualities of this album, and for that alone, Come Away With Me should not be missed.

1586210912|5.0|Throughout the beginning, middle and end or this book there was a considerable amount of time was spent explaining the main concepts as you would to a child. This is because this kind of material is foreign to most people and to break it down from the fundamentals and out is important in order to ensure understanding. Explaining what most people perceive contrasted to a rich person's view creates an epiphany for the reader.  As you read along, this becomes more and more apparent and you begin to comprehend how vital these lessons are.  Lessons on financial literacy, income taxes, corporations, balance statements, assets and liabilities are what we need in school. All people should have the privalege of knowing how to survive in the financially-established and insanely competitive world we live in. we need to incorporate Rich Dad's lessons into our curriculum and other significant and now essential aspects of our manifesting culture.
B00000DRXM|5.0|Fresh from a painful split with former band Black Sabbath, and spiralling in an alcohol and drug frenzy, Ozzy broke all expectations with 1980's multiplatinum 'Blizzard of Ozz'.  Partnered with Quiet Riot's guitar sensation Randy Rhoads, former Rainbow basist Bob Daisley and Uriah Heep's drummer Lee Kerslake, Ozzy was back to his hard rocking glory.  'Blizzard' pushes the boudries of Heavy Metal and is surly one of the most influencial Metal albums of the 80's.  Rife with controversy (Ozzy was taken to court for the song 'Suicide Solution' after a teenage suicide in the US) and musical genious, it confirmed Ozzy's place as the God Father of Heavey Metal.<br />I DON'T KNOW - Still the opening track of Ozzy's sets today.  Timeless indroducaton to the new Ozzy<br />CRAZY TRAIN - Ozzy's coronation as a solo artist.  Rhoads at his devestating best, and Ozzy documenting his life with pin-point accuracy - \\"I'm going off the rails in a crazy train!\\"<br />GOODBYE TO ROMANCE - A Farewell and ode to Black Sabbath.  Beautifully constructed melodies with fantastic keyboard work<br />DEE - Rhoads' instrumental to his mother.  Offers the audience an alternative side to Randy Rhodes and reminds us of his classical heritage on the guitar<br />SUICIDE SOLUTION - The infamous track that landed Ozzy a court hearing for alledged subliminal messaging within his records. A foolish young teenager in the states decided to take his own life after hearing ozzy tell him to fetch the gun and \\"shoot, shoot, shoot\\" B#ll#cks. The song is in fact dedicated to the late Bon Scott of AC/DC who died tragically at the hands of alcohol.  Fantastic riffing once more from Rhoads <br />MR. CROWLEY - A dedication to Occult figurehead Aleister Crowley.  A dark opeing sequence followed by more crushing riff work from Rhoads.  Randy's solo work is sublime <br />NO BONE MOVIES - Rock and Roll at its purist from Ozzy.  A number about his addiction to (among others) pornography<br />REVELATION (MOTHER EARTH) - Sensational.  The mecurial highlight of the album.  Rhoads is out of this world...A masterpiece that can not be done justice through words.  A musical journey that reminds us that while Ozzy can bite a good bat, he can sure as hell write songs<br />STEAL AWAY (THE NIGHT) - Ends the album on a high.  An easy listener from Ozzy with a great riff that follows nicely from Revelation
0676973779|5.0|Although this book started slow, once it got going, I couldn't put it down! Such an amazing story; the book jacket does not do it justice, and I'm glad. Definitely one of my top five books I have ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|I loved this event but the reason I did NOT give it 5 Stars was because of the Goldberg and LEsnar match. Austin was the star of the match and he wasn't even wrestling. They have a stare down for close to 5 minutes. Through the match you hear crowd chants of \\"Boring\\", \\"this match sucks\\", and \\"You Sold Out\\". The one match I was actually looking forward to the most was a waste of space. <br />Now every match was good but some were better than others. Matches of the night in my opinion are Eddie and Kurt, Main event Triple Threat Match, and Chris Jericho and Christian.<br />Cruiserweight open was good but too short. WAtch as ultiomo Dragon enters the ring he slips and it's very noticeable. He slips when he gets into the ring as well. Kidman almost broke his neck with his shooting star press. <br />Kane and undertaker was a 7 minute match. It was really based on Undertaker's return not the match itself. If you want to see these guys really go at it in a hard fought battle then check out Wrestlemania 14. <br />So check this out the dvd itself will be 3 discs. First two disc will have the matches, HAll of FAme footage,interviews,HEAt and the 3rd disc will have 10 greatest Wrestlemania  matches and Mania of Wrestlemania documentary. GEt this dvd when it comes out. It is still a great WRestlemania.
B000007U6V|5.0|Kraftwerk's fourth album, 1974's &quot;Autobahn&quot;, is not only a milestone for the group but for popular music as well. &quot;Autobahn&quot; marked the beginning of an era of synthesized pop music which would later explode in the early '80s. Had it not been for &quot;Autobahn&quot;, bands such as Devo, Depeche Mode, The Human League, OMD and countless others may not have ever existed.<br />The &quot;Autobahn&quot; album, despite it turning 30 years old in 2004, still retains a vast amount of freshness and timelessness. Quite honestly, the album is still being discovered and embraced by generations of music lovers.<br />For this album, Kraftwerk expanded its line-up to a quartet with percussionist Wolfgang Flur and violinist/guitarist Klaus Roeder joining founding members Ralf Hutter and Florian Schneider. Flur provided the rhythms using a handmade electronic drum kit while Hutter and Schneider modified their sound with the very latest in synthesizer technology (notably Minimoog and ARP synthesizers). Mix these experimental techniques with a dose of cheerful poppiness, and the end result is a winning combination.<br />&quot;Autobahn's&quot; title track is essentially an extremely long pop song clocking in at nearly 23 minutes. The different sections of the piece are divided between sung verses and choruses with lengthy instrumental sections which paint an audio picture of driving the German roadways. The stereo effects (especially those which are heard in the middle of the piece) are well executed as the band recreates the sounds of vehicles whizzing by at rapid speed with their electronic instruments.<br />The remainder of the album is taken up by four shorter pieces. &quot;Kometenmelodie 1&quot; is a slow dark forboding piece that has a sound reminiscent of Tangerine Dream. &quot;Kometenmelodie 2&quot; is an upbeat version of &quot;1&quot; with a slight '60s surf rhythm provided by Flur along with pleasant melodies provided by Hutter and Schneider. &quot;Mitternacht&quot; is another dark cinematic piece in the style of Tangerine Dream. Hutter and Schneider provide a slow repeated five note phrase while Klaus Roeder provides eerie wolf-like tones from his electric violin. This is probably the most haunting piece of music Kraftwerk has ever committed to tape. The album's closer &quot;Morgenspaziergang&quot; begins with electronic bird chirps and waterfall effects before Schneider brings in a pleasant melody with his wooden recorder and flute. Hutter then joins him on the piano followed by Roeder's guitar which turns the melody into a playful child-like round. This brings the entire &quot;Autobahn&quot; album to a close.<br />&quot;Autobahn&quot; continues to remain a timeless classic and a groundbreaking blueprint for electronic music. Even today, Ralf Hutter and Florian Schnieder continue to enter new boundaries and are still very much alive today as Kraftwerk. Wolfgang Flur remained with the band until 1990. Klaus Roeder's time with the band only lasted as long as this album. Before Kraftwerk hit the road to tour in support of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, he was replaced by a second percussionist Karl Bartos who, like Flur, would remain with the band until 1990.<br />&quot;Autobahn&quot; is a definite must for anyone's music collection. This is an historic masterwork which paved the way for the music of the future. A classic worthy of every possible merit!!!quot; is another dark cinematic piece in the style of Tangerine Dream.

0671042858|3.0|I picked this book up only when I found myself with nothing else to read, and up until the middle to end, I was completely enthralled.  I am not an avid Stephen King reader, but do enjoy a lot of his work, so perhaps my opinion of this one would be far different from that of a person who reads all of his novels. The basis for this book is fear itself and how it can so easily consume us, and in that aspect, it was very well done, considering it is written from the perspective of an adolescent girl.  His talent for character really shows through here.  He is very good at evoking a sense of panic in the reader by so delicately informing that Trisha, our young heroine, is going deeper and deeper into the wooded abyss of the forest.  This book is very good, and very strong, up until the ultimate &quot;showdown&quot; between Trisha and the evil _______(I don't want to ruin it.)  It makes a complete turn and becomes downright silly very quickly.  I admit, die-hard fans of Stephen King may disagree, but I was so disappointed.  Such a letdown.
068983571X|5.0|This is hands down one of the best mysteries ever written by Doyle. While Amazon categorizes it as a book for 9-12 year olds, I believe it may be too difficult for the low end of this age range. Either way, adults and young adults alike who enjoy mysteries, or just a suspenseful story written by a master of the craft, should read this book. (...), I know how difficult it is to put together a moving story that can hold a reader's interest. \\"hound\\" is a large book that even non-readers will quickly become absorbed in. I highly recommend it.
B00005JMNA|5.0|I LOVED the movie!!! I think that it is the best movie I have seen in a long time! I love Diego Luna or Javier which ever you wanna think about...he is so hot! I think that it is better the the original. I think evey one should go see it!!
B00009V7RF|3.0|If you've heard either Behind the Front or Bridging the Gap, you would be as big a fan of BEP as I am. You would also be disappointed to hear how poppy and corny they have become with Elephunk. Although Elephunk does exhibit as much, if not more of the originality that made the first two albums so sublime, the soul and essence of the old BEP are gone. It sounds as if BEP has lost interest in creating music with intimacy and sensuality. Elephunk sounds like a lowest common denominator product for the unskooled masses. <br />However, poor BEP will always be above average. Nearly all of tracks are catchy and danceable, and as long as you don't long for the old BEP, the lyrics are passable. Many tracks like &quot;Hands Up&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot; still have the smooth drum and bass harmony that BEP is known for. And the addition of Fergie and a more studio-heavy approach have added some listening depth to their sound. <br />BEP is a great group, with an uncommon blend of talent and style. Elephunk does convey much of what makes BEP good. But if you want the essence of the real BEP, you will be disappointed.
B000002B30|4.0|If ever an artist deserved to have a two disc greatest hits cd, it was Bruce.  This is a great intro for the casual fan who climbed aboard during the BITUSA frenzy, but the only thing that long time fans might find useful is the inclusion of &quot;Murder, Incorporated&quot;, which I believe may have been a BITUSA outtake, and &quot;This Hard Land&quot;.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game<BR>By: Orson Scott Card<BR>Reviewed by: D. Kaul<BR>Period: P-1 <br />     Andrew (Ender) Wiggin, a boy genius, is chosen to train in Battle School, a floating satellite high above the Earth's orbit.  He is the last hope of mankinds' to defeat the &quot;buggers&quot;, aliens who have attacked the Earth two times before.  Ender is to lead all of the Earth's army against the buggers, trying to wipe them out in an epic tale of survival.  He is isolated from the rest of his classmates and put through difficult, almost impossible tests, that take place in the Battle Room.  But will the pressure and stress get to Ender, or will he save the Earth from extinction?  Read Ender's Game to find out!   <BR>     I really liked Ender's Game.  This book was easy to read but yet hooked me for hours on end.  Mr. Card explains subjects and ideas perfectly, and his descriptions produced vivid images in my mind.  The story line was futuristic, but still in the realm of reality.  It also taught me some things that made sense only after reading it in this book (&quot;But since adults always said it when it was going to hurt, he could count on that statement as an accurate prediction of the future.  Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth.&quot;)<BR>     I disliked this book because some of the concepts weren't really necessary, and some of the ideas could have been made to fit the story line better.<BR>     My favorite parts of the book were the battles in the Battle Room.  They were so exciting, and it always put Ender in difficult situations.  But it was fun to see how he got out of his predicament.
0613550757|5.0|Here is a story I would call a must read. Tuesdays with Morrie grabs you from the start,and you don't want to let go. <BR>The lead character Morrie Schwartz is the reason why. <br />This is the story of a man, a College professor, but really a unique man in that he faced death with more dignity and courage than one can imagine. Stricken with ALS, Morrie is aware of his death sentence and faces it with grace and strength; <BR>terming it his 'final class'. A teacher to the end, he invites us to learn along with him and his former student, writer Mitch Albom. <BR>The lessons here are on love, forgiveness and family. Albom chronicles Morries last days in a sentimental story that inspires and illuminates. <br />I give Morrie and the book an A.
B000001FNL|5.0|Even thought I was borned at the laterest 80s, I was so lucky that I had a chance to listen those energetic songs. Jive Talkin' was absolutely the best song in this album! <BR>Apart from those sucessful albums, &quot;Main Course&quot; also could not be eliminated!
B00008NG5V|2.0|I eagerly anticipated the second installment of J.Johnson, but was unfortunately let down. His fiorst album had a vibe and sound all it's own, although several of the songs were similar in style, they were different enough to make them unique and enjoyable. On and On does just that, goes on and on sounding the same almost all the way through, very redundant and almost too similar to Brushfire without the freshness. I wouldn't recommend it, but go ahead if you want to hear his new stuff
B000001FG5|5.0|This ablum is definitely great! Like Barry said, those songs such as&quot;Too much heaven&quot; had their spirits and gave me a peaceful feeling. <BR>Beside &quot;Odessa&quot;, &quot;Main Course&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, why don't we spend some money to listen those songs within this life?
076790592X|4.0|Tuesday's With Morrie was a great salute to the teachers of the world. Mitch Albom shares with us a glimpse into what must have been a very personal journey for him, spending 14 Tuesdays with his former college professor, Morrie, as Morrie is dying from ALS, &quot;Lou Gerhigs' Disease.&quot; On each Tuesday, as Mitch witnesses this man deteriorate bit by bit, Morrie shares with Mitch life lessons about love, priorities, and relationships. <br />Tuesday's is a great rainy day book; curl up in your favorite chair with a cup of hot chocolate and reminisce with Mitch and Morrie. It will make you want to call your mom and your favorite teacher. Both of which I recommend doing. <br />It's not a deep book, by any means, and you should not read it looking for a philosophical description of dealing with death. It is not that. It is a love story between two friends, a teacher and his student. That we could learn as much as Mitch did.
0671027387|5.0|This book does a good job of using real scientific data to create a believable, yet fictional novel. Dan Brown also uses his talented writing ability to keep the pace of the story moving rapidly. Politics, science, suspense, action, and even a touch of love are crammed into this book. Consequently, I couldn't put this book down. The short chapters combined with the interesting story and realistic characters make this book a great short read for anyone. And the most fascinating part of this book is that it is not inconceivable that the events Brown created could happen. Regardless of your interests and expertise, there is something in this book for you, especially if you like fiction.
B0000V8F0Q|4.0|Whether they go the route of parody or stick true to the original source material, Hollywood has about a 25% success record of making successful films from television serieses. (...) The movie S.W.A.T. is loosely based upon the flash-in-the-pan television series by the same name from the 1970s and is one of the few based-upon-a-tv-movies that actually works well.<br />The movie stars Colin Farrell as a former S.W.A.T. member who is demoted after being involved in a successful hostage rescue operation which resulted in a civilian being wounded. Farrell's partner quits the force, but Farrell stays on and takes a huge career demotion working in \\"the cage\\" (the weapons check out place). He's eventually picked up by Sgt. Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) to be a part of a new Los Angeles S.W.A.T. team. The team bonds, has a minor assignment, then gets involved with the transportation of an international crimelord who was discovered and arrested because of a broken tail light.  The crime boss offers $100,000,000 to anyone who can successfully free him and all the thieves, gangs, and thugs go wild.<br />I was pleasantly surprised while watching the movie and I really enjoyed watching S.W.A.T. There are two main reasons for that.  First off, S.W.A.T. is one of the few movies based on a television show that actually works. The movie is different from the show, yet remains fairly true to the spirit. Not only that, but the movie feels like you're watching a huge television show, complete with places where television commercials could have been placed.  Besides that, S.W.A.T. is also a movie that doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. The movie is a huge action picture and it has no intentions of being anything but that.  It doesn't pretend to be anything totally new and original.  Since the film doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, it works well and at times seems surprisingly realistic.<br />Other than a few innuendos, the movie has no sexual content. There is a lot of violence, but none of it gory or all that graphic. There is a lot of foul language and that's the main thing that keeps the movie from being completely \\"family friendly\\".<br />S.W.A.T. is not a movie that everyone is going to like. However, if your in the mood for a decent action picture that doesn't seem too silly, you might want to watch S.W.A.T.ot of violence, but none of it gory or all that graphic. There is a lot of foul language and that's the main thing that keeps the movie from being completely \\"family friendly\\".<br />S.W.A.T. is not a movie that everyone is going to like.

0385510438|3.0|The plot was too similiar to that of  &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; This book was certainly not as good as that one but nevertheless enjoyable and a must read for Grisham fans. More time could have been spent on character developement and character relationships. This novel lacked the usual Grisham humor, complex characters, and plot twists. Overall, still a good read but not one of Grisham's best efforts.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones' first record Come Away With Me(for the new fans buy that if you like this record)was a very laid back sorta dark CD, mellow and relaxing. The same vibe resides on this record but with a more upbeat feel. It is very apparent in the record's first couple of tracks, &quot;Sunrise&quot; is a great opening to this record, gives you a feel of what the rest of the record is like. #2: &quot;What am I to you?&quot; Another good song more bluesy but still upbeat. #3: &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; The box percussion, accoustic guitar, and Norah's voice make this track. #4 &quot;Carnival Town&quot; One of my favorite tracks on the record, it's mostly an instrumental the accompanying strings play well into the mellow feel.#5 &quot;In the Morning&quot; Track is very well played, well sung too. #6 &quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot; Another one of my favorite tracks, it's a Townes Van Zandt cover, it's one of those Jazzy Slow-Dance Songs that you crawl up with your lover and listen to. #7 &quot;Creepin' In&quot; Dolly Parton guest stars on this upbeat country track I'd have to say it's pretty good and I hate country! #8 &quot;Toes&quot; Awesome track definately my favorite on this record Norah's voice is the driving force on this song and the guitar solo is great. #9 &quot;Humble Me&quot; Great guitar and vocals song it's just the music, nothing electric. #10 &quot;Above Ground&quot; One of those songs you sit down and drink coffee to, vocals are somkey and slow. #11 &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; A country/blues song,great to listen to while your on the road. #12 &quot;The Pretties Thing&quot; Good Jazz track Well played and sung just sit back and in enjoy it. 13 &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; Norah Jones wrapped up Come Away With Me with &quot;Nearness of You&quot; now with Feels Like Home she puts lyrics to Duke Ellington's &quot;Meloncholia&quot; to create &quot;Don't Miss you at All&quot; a great track that is just Norah playing the piano, it's a beaufital song andgreat way to wrap up a great record. That's my review hope it convinced you to buy this record. Now I'll finish this up very Dennis Miller like &quot;Of course that's just my opinion I could be wrong.&quot;
B000000LZV|5.0|this is the greatest album of all time. period.  if you don't have the brains to grasp that, then it wasn't meant for you anyway.
0671027387|4.0|This book is really a good read.  It is a little slow at the start; but once it gets going, it really gets going.  It has enough cliffhanging chapters to keep you from wanting to put the book down.  You learn early on that the groundbreaking discovery of a meteorite with the fossils of an alien lifeform is nothing but a huge deception.  But the book keeps you guessing about who is behind that deception and willing to kill to keep the secret a secret.  Is it the President?  The head of NASA?  The President's Chief of Staff?  Or someone else entirely?<br />Although the book may stretch the bounds of believability at times, Brown infuses enough sceintific realism that it still works.  Brown has created characters that seem real and that make the reader care about what happens to them.  Good guys you want to cheer for and bad guys that you boo and hiss at.<br />I am surprized that this book has not been made into a movie yet.  In many ways (like Micheal Crighton books) it reads almost like a screen play.  With the huge success of The DaVinci Code, and a likely movie to follow of that book, do not be surprized if a movie will also be made of this exciting work by Dan Brown.
B00004T0P1|5.0|I didn't go see this movie, I just happened to turn to the Disney channel and stumbled onto the beginning and the &quot;Egg Travels.&quot; I am a huge fan of movie scores, but this one immediately blew me away! So I immediately bought the CD during a commercial break!<br />My favorites are, of course, &quot;The Egg Travels&quot; with its soaring instrumentals including a lot of my favorite: the French Horn and choruses. I also loved the first piece: &quot;Inner Sanctum/Nesting Ground&quot; which starts with such a peacefulness and innocence before people got on the planet and mucked it all up. Send another asteroid before they kill everything. Please! <br />If you're a JNH fan, you will NOT be disappointed!
B000005HLV|4.0|First, it needs to be said that, Hellhammer aside, Mayhem has never been a technically proficient band.  Any review that claims &quot;Mayhem will impress you with its technical display&quot; is essentially lying; and while Hellhammer is perhaps the second best drummer in the extreme (i.e. death, black, etc.) metal scene (second only to perhaps Flo Mournier of Cryptopsy), you do not necessarily hear all of those skills on this album.  If you want to have your head torn off by Hellhammer's drumming, you would be better off listening to Mayhem's &quot;Wolf's Lair Abyss&quot; or &quot;GDOW&quot; albums.  In closing this paragraph, if you want to listen to &quot;technical&quot; black metal, try Immortal or even latter-era Emperor (though I do not like Emperor all that much).<br />Technical issues aside, it needs to be said that, alongside Immortal's &quot;Pure Holocaust&quot;, this album is perhaps one of black metal's defining moments.  Many people will cite Celtic Frost as the forefathers of black metal...well, just my opinion, but Celtic Frost is nothing to write home about.  Mayhem and Immortal and (to a lesser degree) Emperor were the original three driving forces behind the dissemination of the Norwegian black metal sound, and while I think Immortal is essentially superior to Mayhem is all regards (with the drumming almost at par), I must give credit where credit is due: Mayhem, perhaps for what occurred outside of the music more than what occurred on the albums, served to inspire many black metal bands that followed.<br />However, does the fact that a band is highly influential necessarily translate into the band automatically making high-quality albums?  In many cases, we know the answer is no, and with Mayhem (who have really only released two full length albums in 17 years), I am tempted to say &quot;no&quot; as well.  While many Mayhem fanatics constantly praise the &quot;mood&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot; of &quot;DMDS&quot;, I cannot overlook the atrocious vocal performance of Attila.  If you want to label it &quot;necro-opera&quot; and try to vindicate it, fine; but I find it plain embarassing.  Now some people will say, &quot;vocals are only one part of the album...&quot; and while this is true, they are an inescapable part, constantly there, making you laugh more often than snaring you into the &quot;atmosphere.&quot;<br />Production values cannot be faulted since most black metal albums of this era had intentionally crappy production, nor can the lyrics, since most of the Scandinavians tend to use humorous/faulty grammar.  Aside from the vocals, then, the only other problem I find (and this, I grant, is entirely subjective) is that most of the songs do not resonate with you nearly as much as they should for a &quot;landmark&quot; album.  I am not saying the songs are bad or poorly written; I am giving this four stars, after all.  I am merely suggesting that it would not surprise me if someone came to Amazon, saw all the high reviews of this album, bought it, and was underwhelmed.  <br />DMDS is a very good black metal album and a very important one: but it is not outstanding, in my humble opinion.
0385504209|2.0|Besides boring you with the background of the author / book, the details of which most of you know already, I'll start out with the positives.<br />As far as mystery novels go, I suppose this is average. I don't know enough about the genre to accurately criticize, but I know that I had to keep reading to discover the answer / solution to any of the given puzzles presented. At the worst, you can say it's brain candy. Some of them you could see a mile away, other ones you would need to be steeped in the esotericity of secret societies (assuming they exist as Brown presents them). It got tedious after a while, because Brown put a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter, and THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED OF THEM. Anyone being punched in the jaw repeatedly and with such frequency would start to lose feeling. The ending, which most people have a problem with because it's open-ended (stupid Hollywood ruins everything) was interesting.<br />I won't go into the glaring historical and religious inaccuracies that are obvious to most people who retained their Sunday school lessons. More learned people give apt criticism on amazon.com. My gripe is with Brown's premises themselves.<br />To Brown, everything in the world has pagan origins. Any conceivable geometric shape (even triangles and circles, the number 2, and the iambic pentameter are somehow pagan? Yeah, he went there), number, name, painting, architechture style , flower, my boogers, can all be traced back to prehistoric tree-hugging nymphomaniacs.<br />Besides the fact that this assumption is horribly wrong, there is a faulty conclusion you can draw from this. If everything is of pagan origin, then you're probably going to assume that anything that comes after that is a perversion of the the pagan worldview. This is especially true if you have a huge anti-Christian bias like Brown does (he throws Christianity a bone near the end, clerically absolving the Catholic church of any wrongdoing in the books event...gee, thanks). In Brown's world, that would mean a ham sandwiches and window panes are offensive to paganism, by the very fact that it came after.<br />The other option, instead of being a symbolic pervert, is that, in using the symbols, you are secretly passing its original (pagan) meaning. Neverminding the fact that this destroys the meaning of what a symbol is entirely, Brown's world looks like this:<br />1- Everyone uses symbols.<br />2- All symbols have a pagan origin.<br />3- If you use a symbol, you are either perverting the original pagan meaning, or passing on its original meaning secretly.<br />4- Jay just drew a circle.<br />5- A circle is a symbol.<br />6- Pagans used the circle to represent the sun.<br />7- Therefore, Jay is either perverting paganism or passing on the pagan idea of the sun (and so are thousands of unwitting children in the classrooms of the world).<br />On page 172, Brown's narrator say that one of the perils of being a symboligist (someone who studies symbols, a somewhat fictitious career) is that you can make connections where there are none. Brown destroys his premise with this one sentence.<br />Inconsistencies aside, the other irritants in this book are Brown's obvious stereotyping, and hangups with Christianity. All of the college students in his protagonists classes are horny frat boys or women pining away to be considered literal goddesses. He equates Christianity with Catholicism, and takes the usual cheap shots (pedophile priests, the Inquisition, \\"secret murders\\", etc.). Brown plays religions like a syncretistic proto-feminist's wet dream, hoping that someday all faiths can agree (*yawn*). This, combined with lousy character development, makes for bad art. Read it for its suspense and as an alternate, pagan wishful-thinking reality, but disregard all of the historical, symbolic, and logical inaccuracies.In Brown's world, that would mean a ham sandwiches and window panes are offensive to paganism, by the very fact that it came after. <br />The other option, instead of being a symbolic pervert, is that, in using the symbols, you are secretly passing its original (pagan) meaning.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is one of the best children stories I have ever seen no matter how many times i see it.My son is 3yrs old and he had never seen it before he wants to watch it all the time.He also has taken it to his daycare for the children there to watch.Every child should have this movie.Even my husband enjoys watching it with me and my son it is truly a family movie.
0446608955|5.0|A walk to remember<BR>By: Nicholas Sparks <BR>Reviewed by: H. Moten<BR>Period: Pr.3<br />The book I read is called A Walk to Remember. This book is mainly about a guy named Landon who fell in love with an unpopular girl named Jamie. But when Landon found out that Jamie had cancer, he did anything to get help. When he found out that she was going to die. He asked her to marry him. Six months after their marriage, Jamie had died of Leukemia.<br /> What I liked about this book was that the time period took place in the 1950's. That was different from the other entire book I have read. I also loved the story. It's also different than all the other books. <br /> What I disliked about the book was that it was too long and it took along time for me to finish. Although it was a great book. I don't really have to say anything bad about this book because I thing it's a great book. <br />   My favorite part in this book is when Landon went to go look for help for Jamie. When he went to go find a cure. I thought that part of the book was really sweet and tragic. I also like the part where they told the problem. I thought that was really sad.
0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings continues in the fast-paced, well-detailed, epic fantasy work that started with A Game of Thrones.  George R. R. Martin continues to detail the political and military conflicts of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.  The surviving characters from the original book continue to thrive as fully three-dimensional characters with clear personalities and motivations.  In A Clash of Kings the stakes become higher because there are many claimants to both the Iron Throne and to the various other &quot;new&quot; kingdoms.  Martin is a master of pacing and character development in the Song of Fire and Ice series.  This is epic fantasy that does not get lost in its own mythology, but instead details characters and stories and plots that grab onto the reader and will not let go.  I highly recommend this book and the series.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|I must say I am glad they are trying new things and not recycling the same chants, etc, but also this record sounds like they found a lot of tape on the floor and decided to make a album.  I really like &quot;From East To West&quot; (In my mind it is the long awaited extended version/remix of all the intros to the albums.) The problem with this is Michael singing too much.  He has a hard to manage voice and seems to be running out of ideas for lyrics (very evident by the lyrics in &quot;Look of Today&quot;, a total rip-off of ABC's &quot;Look of Love&quot;.)  I think he was great on some of the previous albums with &quot;The Roundabout&quot; and &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot;, but is faltering.  Some of the dance beats are great, especially on &quot;Look Of Today&quot;, &quot;From East to West&quot; and &quot;Voyageur&quot; but that is it.  I gave it a 3 for effort.
B00009RAJH|5.0|As always, this CD--the debut of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham with Fleetwood Mac -- rates a five for me and most fans and critics.  This reissue has a great number of RARE PHOTOS and nice liner notes, but not much to offer in terms of audio rarities.  The single versions of &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; have already appeared on either The Chain Box Set (1992) or the Very Best of Fleetwood Mac (2002).  Only new tracks are a &quot;jam&quot; and the never issued single version of &quot;Blue Letter.&quot;  But the improved sound is great to have!
B00000K413|5.0|The reviewers who mentioned that a) this album deserves so much more than an &quot;it came from the 80s&quot; nod and b) that it's an undeniable classic nail it.  As for what The Hurting sounds and feels like, TFF channel big hurts into sweeping, arch synth work where space and silence do just as much as the duo's highwire voices...not totally unlike Songs from the Big Chair in intensity, but somehow brisker and lighter at moments...kind-of like the pace of childhood (a major theme for the album).  This genre-defying debut can be recommended to anyone who simply likes sincerely wonderful, fresh, emotional music.  A must-own.
B000063JZQ|4.0|The movie Macbeth was a good movie. After reading the play the characters were exactly what i thought they would look like. The movie followed the play well. Some parts were added into the movie that were not in the play so it was kinda neat to see some extended senses.  The movie was good to watch and made the play more sense because it's easier to see what's happening in the play on t.v then reading it.

B00005JLK0|3.0|Right from the start you can see that this film had alot of potintial. For a film that had one of the greatest openings i have ever seen, and a good ending it had a very average middle. The best thing you can say about this film is that they tried. But don't get it wrong, there were those few moments of pure horror gems, in fact the idea of the film is a great idea. The thing is they didn't go in the right direction with it. Mark Hanlon and John Pogue had a wonderfull idea with this film, and you can tell that director Steve Beck tried to give us a worth while movie. Example of that is the scene were the little girl is showing our hero what happend that night on the ship when every one was murdered. That scene alone could make any viewer at least rent this film. All in all we are left wanting more, but the film tried it's best to give its all. Is it a classic...no, but is it worth your time....yes[at least once].
0792833236|4.0|We all know Robert DeNiro was magnificent in the role of Jake LaMotta but he's not the only remarkable aspect of this movie. Cathy Moriarity, played Vicky LaMotta and she's something to see. What a shame this talented young actress's career never took off. Joe Pesci, in his first movie role plays LaMotta's brother and manager and he probably should've taken home an Oscar for supporting actor. <br />Raging Bull is part Greek tragedy and part Othello. Jake in this movie wants so much, finally gets it and blows it. His jealousy and paranoia drives his brother, the one person who knows and loves him best, out of his life and turns his marriage into a tragedy. The higher the boxer rises (interestingly enough the most beautiful scenes in the movie take place in the ring) the lower the man goes. The movie ends with LaMotta retired, fat, divorced and finally figuring out in his own mind what went wrong. The movie also features one of the most memoriable trailers ever made. You'll never listen to Cavaleira Rusticana again without thinking of Robert De Niro. This was one of the great movies of the 80s.
B000002UAX|5.0|I agree with the 5 star reviewees,the one star posters are musical idiots,who wouldn't know great music if it bit them in the ass!Get the anthology 3 if you wanna hear many interesting demos of these classic tunes.I love this album even 'Revolution 9',which is one of the most hated Beatle tunes.This is my 4th favorite lp of 1968,behind THE WHO SELL OUT by The Who,BEGGAR'S BANQUET by THE STONES,WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT by The Velvet Underground and this great album.If you are a Beatle fan and don't have THE WHITE ALBUM you are missing out.I was too young to enjoy their music then.I was just seven years old.Today I'm 42 but still think the 60'S were a fantastic  musical decade. I get a kick when younger people say how much they dig Beatles or any other 60's  music.It was reaaly a special time.Really the last time we were innocent.
6305327041|5.0|I own this movie and it one of the funniest movies i have.  Tim Roth gives a perfect overexaggerated performance.  Awesome cast, great directors.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|While disc 1 is identical to the original Blue Album (read: awesome), disc 2 may fall short unless you are a true Weezer fan.  Some of the b-sides are (predictably) less powerful than the more familiar Weezer tracks, leaving the listener feeling a little frusterated-wanting the full intensity Weezer has become famous for.
B000002MG1|5.0|Quiet and gentle for most of the album, this CD encompasses more emotions then 20 of the top pop albums do combined today. While speaking politically through many of the songs, R.E.M. also speaks of deeper things.<br />&quot;Drive&quot; - &quot;Smack, Crack, Bushwacked..&quot; The first song on album that discusses George Bush the first. This song goes either way. You can look at it from the Bush perspective, or the idea that the singer is discussing the growing problem of drug use in teenagers. Neither of these have been confirmed by the R.E.M. camp in typical R.E.M. fashion. Beautiful and powerful use of strings.<br /><br />&quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot; - this song addresses the idea of the right to suicide if you're old and dying. Sample Lyric - &quot;I will try not to breathe, this decision is mine, I've lived a full life, these eyes are the eyes of the old, that shiver in the cold&quot;. This song seems contridictory to &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, but in reality it was only talking about the issue of the right to die, and presenting a view from an old person.<br />&quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; - the yodel is borrowed from &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;. Not sure what they were trying to say with this song. It's catchy, and the first happy song on the album. The video to go with this song doesn't explain it either.<br />&quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; - An excellent song about Suicide Provention. The main idea is easy, Everybody Hurts Sometimes. This song has gotten me through some tough times. Just the idea that I'm not the only one out there in pain and going through bad things keeps me going. I know it does for many people.<br />&quot;New Orleans Instrumental #1&quot; - A showcase for the talents of the &quot;other 3&quot; Bill Berry, Peter Buck, and Mike Mills. A great R.E.M. song doesn't have to have lyrics. Personally though I prefer &quot;Endgame&quot; from Out Of Time to this one.<br />&quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; - When I went to a R.E.M. concert on the Up tour of 1999, this song was introduced as Peter Buck's favorite. It discusses the death of your parents, and the pain that comes with the loss. No one can understand the pain unless they've been there and this song conveys that.<br />&quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot; - My Favorite Song of the Album. Very emotional, loud at times. The Monty that is addressed in the title has been thought to be Montgomery Ward. Even better live.<br />&quot;Ignoreland&quot; - This song doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. It's probably the precursor to &quot;Bad Day&quot; off of In Time, even though the original is older. It's a &quot;spleen-venting&quot; rant against the republicanism of Reagan and Bush. It's sad that this song is still revelvant 10+ years later. &quot;Ignoreland&quot; would have fit better on Monster I believe.<br />&quot;Star Me Kitten&quot; - In Peter Buck's words &quot;It's a real perverse love song&quot;. It's one of the few R.E.M. songs I know with the f bomb in it. Star Me Kitten wasn't the original title. I'll let you do the math. If they had used their title for this song they would have gotten a Parental Advisory Label.<br />&quot;Man on The Moon&quot; - The song about Andy Kaufmann, that led to the movie with Jim Carrey. This was written by Bill and Peter, and it seems at time they have two different songs going. Some of the cultural references you may have to look up.<br />&quot;Nightswimming&quot; - Gourgeous beautiful lush song. Mike Mills plays a beautiful piano piece in this song. In this song, the singer is mourning the loss of being able to go &quot;nightswimming&quot;. It's looking back on your teenage years when you could go skinny dipping, and that would be the riskiest thing you could do. The simplicity of the time shines through.<br />&quot;Find the River&quot; - Yet another mourning song, but this one seems more intereptretive. You can take the lyrics to mean many different things. Everyone seems to have a different thought on it. But what most people can agree with is it's one of the best R.E.M. songs ever written, and probably the most overlooked.<br />When the good people at Amazon considered this an essential CD, they were right.

0385504209|5.0|Since my life consists of sitting around here on Wackoff Ave doing nothing but watching old PORN and writing review after review of this book, I reluctantly decided to let go of my wang (2 fingers baby - all the way!)and write yet another review.<br />People, this book is consuming way too much of my precious time. I've got to figure out a way to leave it go. I will soon die. (I really should write `let it go' but us unedumacated types don't know no better.)<br />JEBUS AND DAN BROWN, SHOW ME THE WAY!
B000068802|4.0|I think that this CD was ok.  Some songs were good but others wern't so good.  But the songs that were good rocked!!
B0001JXQEM|5.0|yes, this is just the Blue Album by Weezer, but it's also so much more. the second disc full of b-sides and rarities is amazing! finally a cd that has songs such as &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot; and &quot;Jamie&quot; on it. this is a serious investment for any Weezer fan. it is worth every penny, if not more. this sums up an incredible collection for a modern rock band, as of now. you can only look for better from guys so talented.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade's CD, \\"Lover's Rock\\" is, by far, one of my favorite all time albums. It is a splendid mixture of fantastic and meaningful lyrics, a sexy sultry voice, and wonderfully arranged music. This is one of the best albums this century. Words really cannot do it justice.<BR>The songs are well written with excellent melodies. They touch the soul, especially \\"King of Sorrows\\", \\"All About our Love\\", and the \\"Immigrant Song.\\" They capture her feelings and emmotions harmoniously and in a way that is so touching. It is true medicine for a psyche thats bogged down with stress. I often listen to this CD on my way home from work to unwind after a hard day at work. It helps me mellow out listening to the bluesy r&b sound of her sexy voice. My girlfriend and I also use it to slow dance to after some wine and dinner to capture the mood. I gave this five stars, but if I could have, I would have given her many more. This is definitely worth the money you may pay for it.
6305268843|4.0|4.5 stars.  The one thing I've noticed about films set in England is that the pace of the film is exquisitely deliberate, like a great novel unfolding before my eyes. &quot;Firelight&quot; is no exception to this axiom.  The pace is slow yet fluid and flows so well that I was actually disappointed when the film ended.  I kept thinking, &quot;What happens next?&quot;  I was eager for the story to continue, which is the sign of an exceptional film.  However, this is not perfect, like so many reviewers here suggest.  It is nearly so.  The most obvious flaw is when Sophie Marceau is wading out into the water, breaking the ice to get to her daughter who just fell through.  The ice is fake, to put it simply, looking more like chunks of styro-foam than shards of broken ice.  Something else that bothered me was that Sophie's lover's wife is totally catatonic....and she is still alive in 1837?  It is hardly likely, being as unresponsive as she was, that she would have survived 10 years in that day and age.  They never showed her eating or doing anything during the course of the film, apparently asking the audience to think she survives on willpower alone. Also, when she finally passes, with a little assistance, the husband doesn't grieve very long for one who claimed to love her so dearly.   Sure, he is relieved of the burden, but a long-lost love just died.  I would be torn up, even if I hadn't spoke to her for 10 years.  She was there all along, a constant reminder of a great love that was once vibrant and alive.  But those inconsistencies, and other smaller and more insignificant moments, cannot take away from the fact that this is an elegant film with superb photography, great costumes and set design, and a passionate performance from the undeniable star of this engaging film, Sophie Marceau.  She uses so much subtlety in her work here that the end result is pure magnificence. The best part of this film is the ending, not that I wanted it to end.  Most British melodramasinsist on a tragic ending, but to my delight and surprise this film does not embrace that convention.  Overall, this is a wonderful film, reminiscent of Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and definately worth a look.
0385504209|5.0|Interesting theories, and a very entertaining read.
0380820846|5.0|Great story. never did found one in a bookstore in my country, had to rent it for a few bucks but worth every cent. took me the whole night to finish it and i just had to read it again until six in the morning. i got eye bags but it's really worth it. Colin and Penelope make quite a sweet couple. i always thought they were ment for each other after reading &quot;An Offer from a Gentleman&quot;
B000060P79|1.0|SERIOUSLY!- if anyone knows why is this band famous? They're got awful they are probably the most untalented band I have ever heard in my life! The guitar riffs seem as though they were written by a four year old. And the music is as creative as &quot;when your happy and you know it clap your hands&quot;. There is no complexity at all to this. And I mean sometimes simplicity is great! But in this case NO! The vocals are atrocious too! I SWEAR THEY'RE CHILDREN! Okay I get it POP-PUNK is great! Just bury me in a hole until this fade dies and maturity once again is somewhere lyrically in our music.<br />AH...
B00005JMEW|5.0|I saw  it when it was in the theatre and i was blown away. This director is very talented! Uma gave a spellbinding performance. The fight sequences were nailed perfectly especially the fight b/w Uma and Vivcia Fox! Anyways, considering all the crap that came out in 2003 this was the best movie of the year hands down.
B000089RVX|5.0|At the risk of repeating one of the 1700 or so other reviews of this work, it is a masterpiece, although comparisons with Limp Bizkit are just plain wrong.  Actually, it is more like Creed with talent.  Amy Lee's voice is astonishing, and her lyrics are even more so, although to say they are melodramatic is a BIG understatement.  The guitar work is sometimes awful (too heavy-handed) and the chorus and strings are just plain self- indulgent - I bet they'll never have to sing &quot;saving me, raping me&quot; from &quot;Haunted&quot; again!.  At any rate, these are just nitpicks.  This is a fantastic CD, and I can't wait for the follow-up(s). <BR>Best songs - &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;,&quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;My Last Breath&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot;<BR>Worst Song - &quot;Tourniquet&quot;
0156027321|3.0|Overall this was a pretty good book.  It took me awhile to get into though.  The author writes really well, and this helps when the book gets drawn out.  I wasn't a big fan of the story, until the very end, it really wrapped up nicely.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I loved GnR since I heard them for the first time.  The distinctive original voice of Axl, Slash's riff's, great song writting. This CD has nothing new which is why only four stars.  But all the songs are great.  Too bad they didn't have anything new to add.  Or at least other versions of the songs (which I can't believe I said, since I hate re-mixes!) But if you have all their other albums, why buy this? I mean, I have them all, including the &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; remake that they are using to sell this thing.  Aside from the fact that I've been almost desperate for anything Guns...  I even had to get the &quot;End of Days&quot; soundtrack since it had the 'new' GnR song on it. Waiting for &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; is killing me.  But I'll buy it even if I'm an 80 year old lady. Until then, I guess this will have to do. If you're new to Guns, sure start with this.  But don't cheat yourself.  Buy &quot;Appetite&quot; and the &quot;Illusions&quot; and &quot;Lies&quot; if you can get a copy.  They are worth the money hands down.
0385720920|5.0|\\"The best book ever written\\" isn't the right phrase, but the first that comes to mind.  This is the first Chuck Palahunik book I've read, and I loved it.  Chuck's knack for satire is amazing.  I found myself laughing several times while reading this book.  I'm very impressed with Chuck, and his wonderful imagination.  With this book he's definately become one of my must read authors.  I'd recommed this book to most.  Next up for me: \\"Survivor\\"
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride The Lightning really defines the nature of heavy metal. With great messages as well, such as the apocalypse with Fight Fire With Fire and the song about drowning with Trapped Under Ice. Cliff really shocks us all with the bass. James' vocals take a turn for the better from Kill 'Em All. Kirk and Lars have their part as well.<br />1)Fight Fire With Fire(4:45) - Don't let that guitar intro fool you, after a minute or so, it turns into a masterpiece, led by Kirk. The message is about the end of the world. Classic. 4/5<br />2)Ride The Lightning(6:38) - Now this is also a good song, but just not good enough to best Fight Fire With Fire. But it's still a riveting song. Talks about the electric chair. 4/5<br />3)For Whom The Bell Tolls(5:11) - The opening bells make sure it's a good song, but the chorus seals it. It's a classic, but still doesn't reach the best for me. 3/5<br />4)Fade To Black(6:55) - The first ballad, and a classic one. It's tied with Trapped Under Ice and Creeping Death for best song. No wonder why the good ones are always the ones written by all the guys in the band. Talks about suicide. The longest song with lyrics. 5/5<br />5)Trapped Under Ice(4:03) - Now THIS is the phenominal song. This song, that speaks about drowning and freezing to death, is the shortest and best song on this album. It has the metal feel. James' vocals soar, even past Fight Fire With Fire. 5/5<br />6)Escape(4:23) - I don't care much for this song, actually my least favourite. I, like much others, don't know exactly what this song's about. But still better than some you find on Master Of Puppets. 2.5/5<br />7)Creeping Death(6:35) - Now this the tied with Fade To Black and Trapped Under Ice for best song. This one is about the Pharaoh and Mosus and how the 7 plagues effetced the Pharaoh and how Creeping Death was the cause of the death of the first born male child of every family. It's a real crowd-pleaser when played live. This song was actually covered on Ozzfest 2002 by another good band, Drowning Pool. Their version doesn't beat this, but it comes close. Still, this song is great. 5/5<br />8)The Call Of Ktulu(8:54) - Instrumental, not bad. Although it would've been nice to swap this with Creeping Death. Anyway, this is a tradition to all Metallica albums, Kill 'Em All with Pulling Teeth(Cliff's bass solo), Master Of Puppets with Orion, even ...And Justice For All with To Live Is To Die(well, nearly an instrumental. Still, this one's the best, Yes, it beats Orion. Either way, Ktulu kicks ass. 4.5/5<br />Well, that's Ride The Lightning, overall better than Master Of Puppets. Well, pick this up now. And pick up MoP and AJFA as well.
1400034779|5.0|Set in Botswana, the heart of Africa, where culture and lifestyle are concrete values to the natives, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency portrays a melodious, yet suspenseful and engaging, life through the eyes of Precious Ramotswe.  Mma Ramotswe was born into a world rich in relationships and pride, with the viscous backdrop of African culture.  The story creates a theme of the ironic turns life takes, shown through Mma Ramotswe's wholesome wont to assist people as best she can with the problems they encounter by opening The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  The story fleshes out a heartwarming take on life, made all the more so by Ramotswe's persistence towards setting things right, her values, and her all-around embrace of life.<BR> The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency would be placed under the \\"slice of life\\" category; a taste of the situations Mma Ramotswe finds herself in as the only female detective in all of Africa.  As the reader becomes more in tune to the accepted ways and ancient traditions of the locals, a theme is perceived of the degradation of women and the alleged superiority of men, and how Ramotswe contradicts the stereotypical housewife image.  This is, with out a doubt, a story that shows how women can change the world just as effectively as men can.<BR> Also, Ramotswe's character traits seem to gradually land the reader in her world; little things she does -- like always making bush tea, going shopping at the local market, and her approach to spying on people on the job -- they're minor characteristics, but they are what give the reader a sense of intimacy with her character, as if she's an old friend.<BR> Mma Ramotswe's story deals with the mystery and suspense of her job, which is heavily infused with African culture and the mellow people who live by it.   Women's empowerment is reflected, and Ramotswe's personality is so well elaborated upon, the reader almost begins to picture her reaction to certain completely separate events.  The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency keeps one interested with each diverse case that explores a different dimension of life, and once all of its pages have been turned, the reader is left asking for more.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was simply wonderful. It really was able to bring out the best in people and show just how important the time we share together really is. It did tug on the heart strings quite a bit, but was so inspiring. People can get caught up in so many things that are just not important to the real meaning of life; to love one another! I didn't want the Tuesdays to end, but was very blessed by the time Morrie gave to us through the help of Mitch.
B0001611DI|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is truly a great film.  Granted, it was low budget.  Granted, the techniques for gore and make-up were not as advanced as they are now.  None of that matters--in fact, it almost adds to the feel of the film.  This is one of the most important horror films of all time, and is THE quintessential zombie film.  Though not as widely known as Night of the Living Dead...Dawn delivered what people have come to expect from zombie movies--gore, human survival, creepy atmosphere, and that little blend of comedy.  The chance to own it on DVD again is not something to be missed.  If you don't already own a copy, I'd say get this one...but EVERYONE who is a fan of this movie should get the 2 or 3 disc set that is being planned for September.  The Day of the Dead 2-disc was not something to be missed, and I'm sure this one will not disappoint!
B00003CXBK|5.0|wow... amazing movie...freaky princess...giant boars...lots of blood...and an evil curse taking over the main characters body...shoots the limbs off of soldiers with arrows!!!! <BR>          A MUST BUY FOR ANY ANIME FAN OVER 12!!!!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Before I review this album, let me attempt to pigeonhole their sound, so everyone out there who hasn't heard this album (and shame on you if you haven't) would be somewhat able to know what they sound like.<br />Imagine if Carlos Santana joined Rush in the mid-70s, back when they were awesome. They went to a time-machine, went to today, took some acid, and listened to all the At the Drive-In albums. They all decided, \\"Hey, I like that band and their sound. I think we should make an album like THAT!\\" However, their self-indulgences got the best of them, and they ended up making an album much like their own.<br />The album, in the syle of many a prog band, is a concept album, detailing a fictionalized version of a childhood friend of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (for all you hick-folk out there, its pronounced rod-REE-ges--LO-pes). In the album, he attempts suicide, falls into a coma and explores his own mind. When he wakes up, he still chooses to die, subsequently ending his life. The album, structurally isn't aset of songs, insomuch as an hour-long set of ideas, randomly popping out at you. There is no verse-chorus-verse structure; instead, new sections come out of nowhere and surprise you. I dont feel like going into each song individually; i think that the listener should do that for himself (or herself). All in all, this album may take a few listens, and yes, it is self-indulgent, but it is a masterpiece, so one shouldn't let himself (or herself) get caught up in that sort of stuff. Geddy Lee, I mean, Cedric Bixler does an excellent job at vocals, Omar is a good guitarist, Flea is... Flea, and Jon Theodore is one of the better drummers in rock music today. Give it a few listens, and, believe me, it'll be worth it.
B00005JL2O|3.0|While the wealth of extras in Goldmember are quite interesting, they're marred by the limitations that the Infinifilm process imposes on your DVD player.  According to others, as well as my own experience, Infinifilm disables your players ability to scan and pause.  This means that if you want to step away for a moment, you'll have to either let the movie run or stop it all together.  On the slight up-side, pressing PLAY will return you to the beginning of the chapter you were watching.  And since scanning is disabled, you'll have to watch everything up the point you stopped the DVD.  YUCK!<br />I'm against any kind of control disabling.  Disney does a similar thing by disabling the menu and scan controls during the &quot;Coming Attractions&quot; segment before the movie.  This is just plain wrong.  We, the viewers should have the right to decide how we want to view our DVD's.
B000099T2L|2.0|Ever notice how all the singles released to radio are all fast or mid-tempo from Beyonce? Yes, it's true- just about every other track on the CD is a tired-and-true love ballad. But is this bad? The tracks that we've heard on radio are infectious! There was the summer anthem \\"Crazy in Love\\" which was among the best in 2003! There was \\"Baby Boy\\" with the indisposable-as-a-guest Sean Paul, and the silky mid-tempo \\"Me Myself & I\\" ..<br /> But where's the substance behind that?<br /> Her ballads, in essence, are lacking. \\"Be With You\\" for example, could have been a dance song, with a club-ready opening with the fastest tempo on the entire CD, then *BOOM* it breaks into slow-as-can-be mode. Granted, I turned away from that track halfway through. There's also \\"Yes\\" \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Gift from Virgo\\" which are all boring and bland. The standout is her duet with Luther Vandross \\"The Closer I Get To You\\"..<br /> There is the good though. Aside from the 2 tracks with Jay-Z (the two strongest tracks on the CD might I add) \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"That's How You Like It\\" ..there's \\"Signs\\" with Missy Elliot, \\"Naughty Girl\\" a catchy and breathy dance song. Not to say I like all the fast\mid-tempo songs though.. \\"Hip Hop Star\\" with Outkast's Big Boi is obnoxious and repetitive.<br /> The utterly cheesy? The \\"Beyonce Interlude\\" in which the entire track is Beyonce saying \\"I believe that harmonies are colours.\\" [...]<BR> GRADE: C<BR> BUY?: No, just buy the single for Me, Myself and I and perhaps the import single to Crazy In Love and you'll have what you need from Beyonce.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It is so nice to have uncut, clear episodes. Thank God for digital remastering.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|She's not going anywhere, kids, so you can sit down and stop praying that Britney's going to release a flop. In fact, its been anything but for Ms. Spears, who just released her first #1 single hit in four years. (#1 on radio, not the Hot 100, where it reached #9, also her biggest in four years) The album is poised to go 3x platinum and over the head of Beyonce's solo effort (though Beyonce's has been the hyped one and Britney's the diminished)<br /> Let's get to the content, though..<br /> I can't say that I really dislike any track except the boring and irritating &quot;Early Mornin&quot; ..produced by techno singer (and liberal activist) Moby. &quot;Boom Boom&quot; is also overflooded in  Ying Yang Twin rap.<br /> Other than that, the album's pop perfection. From the opening single Me Against the Music with has-been pop queen Madonna to the R.Kelly, Matrix, and Cathy Dennis penned tracks, it's a perfectly packaged pop product (say that ten times fast) from start to finish. But that's me.<br /> And you might not be a pop fan! Honestly, you should stay away if you aren't a pop person. Obviously, a hard-core punk isn't going to find any material on this CD that you like, and anyone into Eminem or Nelly instead won't find much to like about this CD either (except perhaps the Ying Yang Twins infested &quot;Boom Boom&quot; or the R.Kelly produced\written &quot;Outrageous&quot; both club-bangers)<br /> There are but two tracks that scream &quot;love me&quot; on this CD. &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; both hard not to like, the latter a moving ballad penned by Britney herself, the former the smash single that we've all heard about ten thousand times. (that's how many spins it receieved last week, if you're curious)<br /> But again, it's for pop fans.<BR> BETTER THAN: Stripped, Dangerously in Love, In This Skin<BR> WORSE THAN: 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane (tATu)<br /> BOTTOM LINE: It's Britney Spears. It's addicting pop music.<BR> GRADE: A-
B0001DI0FI|5.0|If ever there were prizes for the best directorial comebacks, then surely Peter Weir should have one. The Aussie director of classics such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli,Year of Living Dangerously,Dead Poet's Society and the underrated Truman Show returns with force after five years absence (Truman being his last in '98) with a powerful film that will engage you in its clever dialog and dazzle you with its well edited action, Master and Commander: the Far Side of The World.<BR>Based on a novel by Patrick O'Brien and a screenplay by Weir himself, it is the cat and mouse chase in the Pacific ocean during Napoleonic times, between a British ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey and a much stronger French vessel.<BR>The success of the film in my opinion lies firmly with the screenplay, and the well written characters that perfectly reflect their time and environment. In a short time, the viewer will find him/herself totally immersed in their individual stories, and will sympathize with their condition, be saddened by their losses and cheer their successes..<BR>I found myself transfixed by the anecdotes at the captain's dinner table about Lord Nelson, touched by the heroism of the little boy, amused by the grumpiness of the steward Killick, and bemused by the sailors superstitions.<BR>And this is not easily achieved but shows that Weir indeed possesses a great talent for writing that equals his visual sensitivities.<BR>The action scenes, safe to say are very well directed and (equally important edited as well). I liked the fact the French vessel remains up until the end,elusive and 'ghost like', as the whole film is seen exclusively through the 'eyes' and point of view of the British ship.<BR>The scenery is quite beautiful, especially the part filmed in the Galapagos islands.<BR>Now the acting, <BR>I don't know if anyone could have played Aubrey's part better than Russell Crowe, if so it would be a very stiff competition.He simply plays the part to perfection, andyou can clearly tell that he was very much at ease in this role, while all the other actors (mainly British) give brilliant performances that complement Crowe's lead and Weir's masterful direction, especially Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy and David Threlfall.<BR>The world of cinema is full of good directors as well as mediocre and bad ones, but only a handful can be considered artists in the truest sense of this word, (especially these days) and Peter Weir is certainly one. You have to see Master and Commander..to know what I mean and to applaud one helluva comeback!
B00005JM0B|4.0|In the latest of action-packed terminator films, #3 was slightly disappointing but better than expected. The effects were great, the new bad guy (sorry, gal) terminator was a excellent concept and the jokes were pretty good coming from the Govener of California (or the Sunshine coast). The bad news is the story (while I applaud its abilities to keep up with its predecesors) was otherwise sad and unbelieveable. the acting (other than the terminators) was pretty bad too, half the time I wanted to yell at Kate Brewster to shut the heck up! half of her dialoge was basicly screaming her head off. The Special features was more than expected and very informational and enjoyable. The most mind-boggeling question was &quot;Why the third enstallment?&quot; the first two were good on their own and settled everything were as #3 just lft the door wide open for T4 (God help us!)<br />All in all. I thought for a unnessesary sequel, it was very enjoyable and watchable. I highly recommend for any DVD collection!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I got a lot from &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; on a first viewing, but I got even more from it on later viewings and with later thought. Often when you look at a movie for the first time you spend all your effort trying to figure out where it is going. It's only later that you can concentrate on the details and not on the over-riding desire for the forward impetus of conventional narrative. &quot;Master and Commander&quot; worked in a very similar way, and also benefits from more than one viewing.<br />One earlier reviewer said it well, that it's about two people facing disappointment and possible change in their lives who give one another a little strength, or at least act as catalysts for hope. Not everyone understands this or at least wants to see a movie about it. For those that are willing to do so, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a beautifully crafted miniature in which not one shot, not one word, not one piece of casting, not one gesture, not one piece of music, is out of place.<br />Also, if you liked this you might also like Antonioni's &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot;. The dumb will think nothing happens in that one too. Those with a little more discernment will love it.
B00006LLLN|5.0|this is one of the if not the best concert cds i have heard. if you like there studio cd you will love this. there is 3 singers in the band and there all have the own sound. you have to heard it to see how great it is.
0141301104|4.0|The Witches <BR>By:Roald Dahl,<BR>Reviewed by:K.L<BR>period 3<br />     This book is about witches terrorizing children. When the main character's parents died, in a car accident, he had to live with his grandma in Norway. The book doesn't tell you the main character's name, because he's telling the story. When he was living with his grandma, his grandma told him scary stories about witches. The boy never believed it at first, until he saw it himself. Later on the boy finds out where the all the witches met. And he over hears what their secret plan, about how they were going to get rid of annoying children. The boy sucessfully ruined their plans, but because of that he was turned into a mouse.  <BR>     I liked the book because, it was an adventurous and exciting tale. I'm a fan of scary stories, so the tales about witches interested me. I liked the author's creative imagination. He made up how witches looked like, and how to avoid them.\\"A witch has a bald head, not even a single strand of hair can grow on it.\\" \\"If you pay attention to the hands you can see that they always wear gloves.\\"<BR>     I don't like the book because it had a poorly drawn illustration. It looks like a child drew it. Another reason was because the story wasn't very interesting until the climax. Not even the rising action appealed to me.<BR>     My favorite part was when the main character was trying to prevent the witches' plans from suceeding. There was so much action and tension, i couldn't stop reading...

0385510438|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book as I usually do with Grisham's new novels.  Though I read it in one day, and though the characters were described in a way that I felt like I got to know them, the plot and ending wasn't as developed or memorable as The Brethren or The Firm.  As I came to the end of the book, I wondered if there couldn't be something that culd have been added to it.  I felt that the mystery and ending intrigue could ahve been drawn out or further explained.  I was just amazed as I came to the last twenty pages that it was all going to be wrapped up in that short amount of material.  Sadly it was.  I'd have given this book five stars had the ending been more developed.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|its a movie about the griswalds that have all of his wifes famil over form christmas. Elane from seinfeld has a part in the movie as there neighbors. if you like the other National lampoons movies the seris you will like this one.
B00013RC8O|5.0|In the mid seventies my father insisted that my family see this film with him, and in '84 Vanishing Point was the first film that I discussed with the man who would become my husband of over twenty years (a '71 Challenger driver/owner).  How many times we watched it on Beta, stopping, rewinding, analysing, in a basement apartment in Normal, Illinois, while the snow mounded up against the frozen windows.  <br />There was an article in a Mopar Magazine in the early '90's that talked about the two sequences with Charlotte Rampling that had been cut from US distribution.  I am still hoping someday to see the one with her in the black hat, where she hisses at Kowalksi and becomes the malevolent spectre of his imminent death. Until then, I am happy to have at last the hitchhiker scene.  It adds a darkness and a texture that enhances the end of the film.  I am sorry that it was cut.  The Sarafian commentary adds a lot too.  Finally!  It is a good thing.

B000065U1N|5.0|As much as I liked this movie you just have to get the book and read the real story. While the movie was relatively faithful to the story I wish they could have been a little more factual. But never the less an excellent story that should be viewed by all Americans.
B0000844I8|5.0|Stargate is an excellent and original science fiction movie. A lot of science fiction is the type that normally only appeals to sci fi  fans, but Stargate has enough of a plot to appeal to a wider audience than one would typically expect from such a film.<br />The Ultimate edition has a short documentary - &quot;Is There a Stargate?&quot; It caters to the ancient astronaut theory, which is questionable, but it was a nice touch to add to the dvd.<br />As for the director's cut included, it has only one more scene than the theatrical release, but it does help a little with laying the background premise of the film.
0140288503|5.0|Every American should be required to read this book. It is an excellent example of the finest and worst points of our culture I have ever read. I had heard and read a lot of great things about this book and they were all true. I am encouraging all of my family members and friends to buy this book and read it.<br />My thanks to the author for sticking with his research and completing this story. And of course my greatest thanks to those men who lived and died in this event. A great testament to the American fighting man and American spirit.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Carlo and Jesse sure know what they are doing.  The Eagles of Death Metal will rip off your face then sweet talk it and put it back on again.  Only true fans rock need apply because anyone else will just not understand.  You should have seen the look on the stooges face at the large corporate product displacement warehouse where I bought this fine album when I asked if the new Eagles of Death Metal CD had arrived.  Trust me when I say it was priceless because the idiot had no clue what he is missing out on.  Cool, ripping blues/boogie monster rock here kids.  No bull mess and chicken poop fake pseudo crude rock like what all the masses of hind ends buy these days.  Yeah you could call the Eagles of Death Metal a cult rock band but who is counting.  So please support these two rocket scientists that call themselves the Eagles of Death Metal and maybe they will grace us with a second album of boot stomping mayhem.
0452282152|5.0|i finished girl with a pearl earring in one sitting. it takes place in the 1660s in the netherlands and is narrated by the clever and beautiful Griet, a daughter of a blinded tilemaker who for monetary reasons becomes a maid in Vermeer's house and later becomes the subject of one of his most famous paintings. it was delicately and superbly written. <BR>tracy chevalier, like vermeer, sees things in a way that is original and crisp. however, also like the celebrated painter, she overlooks somethings. the book is like a painting, but the description wanes as the plot sped up. also, so many things went wrong. it seemed as if the author was trying too hard to throw things into griet's path. she never explains why cornelia is so devious or characterizes Frans, Griet's brother, as much as she could have.<BR>the words were extradorinarly vivid without being wordy. the ending is also satisfying though bittersweet. but what really makes this book a masterpiece is how open the book is to interpretation. at the end, you can argue that protagonist succeeded or you can say she didn't. &quot;sometimes it seems one thing, sometimes the other&quot; (90). only a master empowers the reader and that fact catches the reader's eye like a pearl and makes chevalier's weaknesses less apparent.
0671891634|3.0|This book had a little more meat in it than the Learn and Earn.  Solid information if you are just starting out  Summary:  Join an investors club (This is very good advice, but hard to    do if you have a busy life)    Pick a maximum of 10 companies - (or less in my opinion)    Buy stocks or stocks in a mutual fund      Buy them on a regular basis  (check out on-line access to save time doing this)    Know something about those stocks  (Do this on the computer)    Hold your course regardless of outside factors      Do your homework:  PE, book value, goodwill, debt, and same store sales just to name a few  (One year after reading this book I still have not made the time to go to the library and act on this suggestion.  It is good advice - just hard to do)    Buy more good stocks when others are selling    Perform a regular six month check up (Again - hard to do, maybe tie it to the same day you go in for your semi-annual dental appointment, Kinda like checking the batteries in your smoke alarm when daylight savings occurs.    I guess what this book has taught me more than anything else is that you must take care of your financial goal much like you tend a garden.  You must care for it in order for it to grow.
B00013PHGS|3.0|I picked up TALKIE WALKIE by Air since it seems to be getting rave reviews in all the rags I read (ooh, alliteration!)...<br />Well - I think the music is fantastic.  CHERRY BLOSSOM GIRL is a definite standout on the album.  But - the one or two guys that are singing in their weird whisper/creepy voices... well - the album should have stayed instrumental or gotten guest vocalists.  Shmaybe.
B00002EPMF|5.0|This is the best metal ever devised. After listening to this album many times I still find small nuances about it that I hadn't noticed before. If anyone doubts that this is the pinnacle of guitar genius I urge them to try and prove me wrong. I must also admit that this album tops Death's lineup. Tim's voice is so soothing one second, and the next  he's tearing his high pitched wails through your ear canals. Absolutely the BEST.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Well, I like Offspring but the 2 last albums are not really the bests the offspring, but there's still a lot of awesome songs on Americana!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|absoulutly one of the greatest moments in maidens career along the number of the beast,powerslave etc...,the album starts off with the powerful wildest dreams which it compleatly kicks ass but its not the best,then rainmaker which is very good yet again not the best,the best track on the intire album is no more lies,that song has everything emotional singing,powerful guitar riffs its really good.im not gonna give reivew for every song cause theres like 12 or 11 tracks and im lazy....so very lazy.but just to say that this album is one of the greatist in maidens career.so my final words buy this and enjoy the incredible wild entertaining ride of this album,WOOOOOOOOOOOO.
1565118286|2.0|I can understand all the hype about the book, but it just didnt have anything to lead up too.  After about page 100, it's just repeats of characters actions and stuff, it gets kinda lame.  And the muslim group part makes the book sooooo slow, you gotta skim it.  But then you can't help but feel pity, the way the author throws emotions about how Nazneen feels is almost real.  if the book was only had the first 100 pages it would've been cool, but at then end you're just like, dude, this book blows.
B000009EAD|3.0|ok i am a fan of ballads but these ballads are a bit crappy and there are a lot in almost every song,the best on this album is disciples of the lie and stand alone thats it but after the ballads there is a lot of heavy stuff in here.so if they had ballads on just a song or 2 i would've gave this 4.5.so in my opinion get this if your a fan of lots and lots of ballads,but if you like ballads but not too much you would think this is okay,but if you dont like ballads at all you probably shouldnt get this
0671015206|5.0|I feel that this is a book gives many good suggestions which can help someone become a succesful person in life. I learnd a lot from reading this book. it really gave me a new idea on who the millionaires are in the us. I believe that everyone should at least read part if not the whole thing.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|Not including extras is one thing but releasing this edition without the close captioning just shows contempt for the hard of hearing.
B000007R13|5.0|What's not to like?!?  If you already own this or know it, you can't possibly have anything bad to say about the mix or otherwise on this terrific collection.  If your system is worth a crap, it's gotta sound amazing!  Easily the best version of this available; DTS needs to do WAY more discs of classic stuff &amp; otherwise!  This is the only way to hear music!  Now if they'll just do the complete &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; or &quot;Made In Japan&quot;!!  The Wolf
B00006CXXU|5.0|If the album's great like this, my review's brief.  This girl's got so much talent, amazing range.  The lyrical content couldn't be better.  Each song is different from the one preceding it and my faves are:<BR>1.) Beautiful - inspiring lyrics, her range shows here<BR>2.) Dirrty - a fun dance song <BR>3.) Voice Within - something Whitney would sing<BR>4.) Can't Hold Us Down - Great beat w/ help from Lil Kim.<BR>5.) I'm OK - about her abusive father, song's lyrics stick w/ you<BR>This is one of 2002's best...okay, it's '04, but still, this will remain great and difficult to top.
B000002HHB|5.0|Great voice, great lyrics and Natalie e for sure one of the best female song writers. Carnival is a MASTER PIECE of pop music. Her best CD ever. If you like poetry and you like good MUSIC this CD is delicious!!!!!
B00000IOSU|4.0|Sarah seems to be in a constantly melancholy mode here, which is fine with me.  Because the songs are all done live, you feel the lyrics, the words, the instrumentals, all more than ever.  Her voice is haunting and her lyrics speak depths - sometime depths I can't understand, LOL.  My fave tracks are:<BR>1.) Building a Mystery - Who is the man she speaks of?<BR>2.) Possession - Just really amazing song, LOL!<BR>3.) Sweet Surrender - Good backup, haunting melody.
0141301155|4.0|Title of the book: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<BR>By: Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake(illustrator)<BR>Reviewed by: J. Kim<BR>Period 6<br />      Willy Wonka's chocolate factory finally opens! However, only 5 childrens gets to go into the factory. The winners were Augustus Gloop, an enormously fat boy who likes to eat; then there's Veruca Salt a spoiled little brat that get whatever she wants; theres Violet Beauregarde a kid that loves to chew gum; theres a T.V. freak Mike Teavee; last but not least there is the hero Charlie Bucket a kid from a poor family but honest and kind. they all gets ready for the best tour of their lives.<br />      Theres many reasons why I like this book and dislike this book. I like this book because it opens your imagination free and it is so detailed like this quote \\"look Violet is still chewing that old dreadful gumthat she had for 3 months.\\"However the thing that I dislike about the book is that the kids get punished in an obvious things like Augustus gets punished for eating too much.<br />      The favorite part of the book for me was when Charlie's family gets the factory for themself because they were really poor, and they deserved it because they are so nice and honest. this is why this was the favorite part of the book for me.
B000002I2G|5.0|This is the LP I often call the Doors' most underrated. When it first appeared in 1969, many hardcore fans lamented the fact that the band augmented it's usual lineup with horns, strings and a host of other instrumental touches that seemed to soften their hard charging, blues based, spacy attack. Well, don't believe the hype, this is the band stretching out to glorious effect on suberb tracks like &quot;Shaman's Blues&quot;,&quot;Easy Ride&quot; and the incredible 3 part title track (featuring a frightening spoken word intro by Morrison)that all adds up to one of the more varied and consistently listenable records this L.A. band ever released.
B00000AFGM|4.0|This is a bittersweet musical affair not weighed down by overproduction claustaphobia and for that, I like it...<BR>Firstand, like Madonna, the purported &quot;genius&quot; of Marilyn Manson doesn't stand out so much in his musical scope as it does in his ability to make a sort of warmed over controversy that is safe in its defiant edge compared to the likes of Slayer and Cradle of Filth. Musically speaking,this album brings the iconclastic reputation of Marilyn Manson to its musical agenda with a satrical irony, and that, coupled with a batch of good songs, makes ammends for previous records that wore very thin after the first listen(if &quot;Smells like Children&quot; is actually cherished by you, you may want to skip my review of it and other subsequent releases by MM).The album here is dynamically good, with many suprises in store for the listener. One of the benefits here is the relaxed and less sonically taut production that buried the songwriting on &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. With not too many overcrowding filters and dense arrangments to hide behind, the standard formats of the organic song components surface and bring a freshness to the musical table, not achieved before this record, and not achieved since. There is only one throwaway song(&quot;User Friendly&quot;)and the rest warmly embrace melody, focused songwriting subtlety, and the craft of molding these ingrediants into the narrative of &quot;Omega&quot; and his &quot;Mechanical Anaimals&quot; band.<BR>My favorite tracks on the album(and the best) are the highly emotionally charged and naked sad song/dirges(like &quot;The Speed of Pain&quot; and &quot;Dissasociative&quot;) as well as the effective and affecting opening and closers (&quot;Great Big White World&quot; and &quot;Coma White&quot;). There is a new dimension of strength in the instrumentation as well as in the lyrics. It's actually the best, by far, that this band has ever come up with. I'm in no ways a person who admires Marilyn Manson/Brian Warner or thinks of him as a bleeding heart artist brandished obscene and neglected by the establishment. I  find him to be sort of a prudent and watchcare oppertunist who glides along with socio-political trends to set up his shock value theatrics(which don't have much ingenuity or class to them by the way), but I listened to this album, and was actually moved by the material(not all of it mind you). In summary, this may not be the most original release in the world(duh)but for any one who would ever consider buying music from this sort-of talented, sort-of interesting band, you'd better pick this one up, and leave the rest in the bin.<BR>lw
B00005BJPO|5.0|As the owner of the Criterion Collection Akira laserdisc, which was the definitive edition for many years, the only area where I felt needed an upgrade was the color separation and contrast of DVD.  With the Special Edition metal tin, my heart was racing with excitement that Pioneer had delivered me into the next generation of quality for Akira.  Then I caught the great film on a digital projector in Burbank.  I can't describe the anguish that I was feeling.  The English dub from the theatrical release was displaced with a second rate production devoid of passion.  <br />Probably the most heinous omissions from the film: &quot;Oh no, not that way!&quot; when one of the Clowns takes an off-ramp and blows up moments later, &quot;Scumbag!&quot; as a riot policeman drills a rioter with a tear gas can, &quot;Do it now!&quot; the Colonel growls to gain passage into Akira's subzero chamber.  Replaced with absolutely nothing, no dialogue whatsoever.  I found myself screaming at the screen.  What some people don't understand is that the original English dub has become a part of entertainment history.  Samples have been used in many songs and to replace it entirely is tantamount to blasphemy.  I'm sure some Japanese purists feel the same way, but they should not have released Akira with an English dub if they felt so strongly.  &quot;You neanderthal pile of crap!&quot;  &quot;Cretan scumbag!&quot;  Such choice dialogue cannot be easily replaced.  <br />Being in the post production business myself, I undertook a project to extract the original dub from the two laserdiscs and then encode the audio into AC-3 tracks over the admittedly good quality of the remastered video.  There were complications, but in the end with the help of a fellow engineer, I prevailed.  It was like magic...DVD remastered video married to the original English dub.  Free at last!
B000001EGA|4.0|My sister was a huge Elton John fan when we were growing up in the '70s, and we used to sit in her room and listen to this album, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&quot; and Pink Floyd's &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; which she brought back from a trip to Europe, along with cigarettes. I like certain Elton John songs a lot, and others, from various periods of his, I really don't like (&quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; for example). I think he's even admitted himself that he didn't like certain songs he released because they were just crap he was spewing out to make a buck, but that's beside the point. This is the good Elton phase in my opinion. &quot;Captain Fantastic,&quot; &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; are really good songs. When I listen to this album (CD, haha), which is creative and unique, I feel like I'm back in that yellow room, and the whole world is out there, just waiting for me and my sister.

B00002MZ2C|5.0|I have reviewed this record once before, years ago when it first came out, back when Rage Against The Machine was at the top of their game, and held the title as the most important political band of the 90's.  I decided to review this again because due to the current events that are taking place right now, in which our rights and freedoms are being threatened by our government.  It makes me sad hearing this record today, because at a time in which Rage Against The Machine is much needed, they are no longer around to give us more ground braking revolutionary music, or to inspire a new generation of fans to stand up for their rights. I have never been into politics in anyway, but right now we are facing some very difficult times in which our government is trying to tell us what we can see on TV, hear on the Radio, and how we can express our opinions to the very government which is using our tax money to fight unnecessary wars, and is flushing our economy down the toilet.  Rage Against The Machine is now, and has always been one of my favorite bands, mainly because of their style of music and talent. Tom Morello is arguably the most innovative and influential Guitarist of our times, while Zack De La Rocha's rapid-fire Rap vocals have always delivered the fuel needed to light the revolutionary fire at the top of his screaming lungs.  Anyone who has followed Rage's music career knows that they have always been very much against all corrupt Governments, including ours, and have always been lieders in the fight for freedom of speech, and against censorship.  Rage Against The Machine is one of the reasons why I have chosen to get involved in this cause, since freedom of speech, and the right to express my opinion is something I have always believed in.  Like Zack de La Rocha said at Rage's final concert, &quot;Some of those that burn crosses, are the same that hold office&quot;.  This is obviously a critical shot againt that Megalomaniac President George W. Bush.  So I stongly encourage anyone who reads this review, to pick up this and all of Rage's records.  Listen to other revolutionary music, Public Enemy, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, John Lennon, Pearl Jam, among others.  Also, support Media Personalities who are being singled out and targeted by the Government and the Religious Right, In this case, Howard Stern.  Boycot certain media Corporations such as Clear Channel and NBC.  This is your way of fighting for your rights as americans, and register to vote.  As you may or may not know, this record came out on Election Day back in 1999.  So come November, vote President Bush out of office, and let Rage Against The Machine's revolutionary Legacy inspire yet another generation of rebels to Raise Up, to stand up for their rights, and always let your voice be heard.  No matter what happens, Never &quot;Do What They Told Ya&quot;.

B000002GFC|5.0|From the opening notes of Wrapping Paper to the end of Badge, this album is the best classic rock you will ever hear.I should call it rock because music today is just crap,especially compared to this.This album is the best you will ever buy.Their music is still as fresh as it was when it was released(The bridge on Badge stll gets me going).Being in a band with E.C., Jack Bruce was way underrated, even tough he wrote most of the songs.He's problably one of the best bass players of all time too.These guys made songs that made(still do)you want to get up, start playing your air guitar,and just rock out.Best.Band.Ever.(LOL)
B0000024JN|5.0|this cd has withheld the times.the songs are still classics.girls,slow and low,the new style.all great songs.this is a cd i still listen to everyday.it does not get old.ad rock, mca, and mike d still rock!
0385512104|5.0|I became interested in reading this book after it won prize upon prize upon award in 2003 and 2004.  The book effectively straddles the line between young adult and adult fiction and has accrued praise from both age groups.  So I picked it up, read it, and can now faithfully say that it is unlike any other book I have read before.  Books about various mental illnesses and problems abound in the world.  This, however, is the first book I have ever read that places the viewer squarely in the head of a boy quite like Christopher. A fifteen-year-old autistic boy.<br />Christopher lives will his father in Swindon, England.  His life is very comfortable and he is looking forward to taking his A-level maths soon.  Fifteen is a young age to be taking such a test, but Christopher is particularly good at math and physics.  Being autistic he has difficulty understanding other people and understanding their emotions and intents.  When Christopher finds his neighbor's dog dead, he decides to do some detective work ala his hero Sherlock Holmes.  What Christopher doesn't understand, however, is that though he may believe himself to be similar to Sherlock, he cannot deny his own emotions when the mystery comes shockingly close to home.<br />I do not know much about autistic persons.  So in truth, I can't say whether or not this book is particularly accurate in its depiction of a fifteen-year-old autistic kid.  What I do know is that Haddon is remarkably sympathetic towards his subject.  The challenge in writing this book was to make Christopher someone you sympathize with, even as he makes incorrect assumptions and violent gestures towards those he loves.  You can see where Christopher is coming from, even as you determine where he makes his mistakes.  This is especially impressive when you consider that Haddon is writing a character that cannot hug, understand love, or figure out how to care for others outside of himself.<br />However, it is the depiction of those who love Christopher that is Haddon's greatest strength.  How rare it is to see things that your narrator cannot see.  To understand where people are coming from even as you see them through the eyes of a boy who is incapable of understanding.  No adult in this book is perfect, but they are all interesting and real.  You comprehend the motivations behind each person's actions.  They are all capable of inappropriate anger and exasperation.  Best of all, the book is incredibly interesting.  Broken up by maps, graphs, equations, pictures, and drawings, the book is continually drawing your eye in a variety of different ways.  It is a wonderful story for anyone into math, but if you are like my pretty self and don't particularly care for sums it is still a wonderful read.  A keeper.topher that is Haddon's greatest strength.  How rare it is to see things that your narrator cannot see.

0385504209|1.0|This could have been a really great read.  The premise is fascinating-- a centuries old mystery and conspiracy come to light in the modern world.  Unfortunately, the writing is so disappointing.  The writer never met a cliche he didnt like.  The characters are wooden (the reluctant professor, the feminine but strong young woman, the evil conspirator, etc). In addition, the writer, so confident of his own cleverness, uses the same puzzles over and over again.  There is some interesting word play, as the characters solve a puzzle left for them by the enigmatic dead man.  But the writer makes use of the same puzzles in repitition until the reader is skimming pages quickly to get to the next new revelation.<br />In some senses this book is a page turner-- because the premise is engaging, the reader does want to know the answers. Its just that the ride along the way is so annoying, and the characterizations are so rushed.<br />One final problem with this book is the number of art history errors it contains!  For example, a Da Vinci painting which dramatically &quot;bends&quot; around the body of one character is actually painted on wood!  A good researcher would never have made this mistake.  There are legions of these little errors, which art historians have gleefully pointed out in many newspaper articles since this book's publication.
B00005NVDF|5.0|A work of genius. <br />While this is one of Woody's finest moments, it also brilliantly underscores one of the dilemmas of modern man.<br />Allen's nerdy new age man Allan Felix is so in his head and ineffectual that his wife simply abandons ship - a brilliant observation on a social a trend that is if anything, on the increase.<br />The magic and true genius of this movie lies in the way Bogart's grounding yet wild Dionysian energy drives Allen's UberNerd to stop whining and intellectualizing and just act. I'm slightly paraphrasing, but Bogie's ghost's advice to Felix to 'Tell her she's beautiful' and 'Go on, kiss her... Go on!' are a joy to behold. <br />The revelation is that by finding his inner warrior, his wild man energy, he is actually successful, and creates a scenario in which the man and the woman can be more comfortable in their clearly defined, yet non-hierarchical roles.<br />While there is immense significance in the role and transforming power of the Bogart figure, this is still a warm, loving and utterly crazy Woody classic and can be enjoyed on any level. <br />Diane Keaton... sigh...
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL exceed expectations(for the most part)with their latest release. This album is intelligent, thought provoking(as always)and definitley far from the mundane. TOOL are to metal what Pink Floyd was to rock, the mind bending, weird band that seems to evoke a sense of intelligence out of power chords and drums. This release is somewhere between Undertow and AEnima. It has the power and rawness of the former but the weird off key rambling of the latter. TOOL have never in my mind fit into any category with Nine Inch Nails or any of those industrial &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands. TOOL are more of a psychedelic and metal mesh. The 13th Floor Elevators colliding with Metallica sums them up perfectly. The Elevators always put emphasizes on their lyrical meaning and the message that is conveyed and they also were known to do it with long grand songs(exceeding the 5 mins mark)like TOOL, but TOOL has a much harder sound, therefore I compare this to Metallica's raw metal and hard rock signature sound. I think they took a very risky chance with this album with roughly 40 to 50% being low key and slightly softer and more &quot;psychedelic&quot; than its predecessors were. But thats not to say that TOOL have forgotten how to head bang, with tracks like Ticks and Leeches still in the mix, I'm sure the metalholics will be satisfied. Anyways if youre a TOOL fan this is a must, if youre not its never too late.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Forget all the fancy rock critic allusions - this is the album you want to have if you're the last person left alive - or better yet, this is the soundtrack you want played as you drift off alone into outer space.<br />The best rock album ever recorded.  Ever.
B00003CX95|2.0|First of I'm 100% Scottish and proud but this film is disgraceful. It's annoying how inaccurate Hollywood has made Scottish history for the sake of entertainment. The wars of Independance were a massivly important time in both Scottish and English history and Hollywood has done a great job or twisting facts for the sake of a juicy story.<br />The script for Braveheart was based on a poem by a medieval poet called 'Blind Harry' This man was highly biased, anti-English (as most were at the time) and at one stage claimed defiantly that Scotland won the batle of Falkirk. Now, imagine a 'history of Iraq' based on personal accounts by the Iraqi Information Minister. It's much the same thing. Biased drivel. <br />One top of this, the film is historically very, very inaccurate. It's true that Bruce did change sides often, but he never fought Wallace on the battlefield. Bruce wasn't even at the Battle of Falkirk. And as it says on the inside of the box: &quot;And won their freedom...forever&quot; is also frankly, rubbish. If Scotland won it forever we wouldn't be part of Britain at this moment in time.<br />This film is only good for blood and guts and a bit of swordfighting and that's why I gave it 2 stars. <br />I see the effect this film has had when I visit the Wallace Monument in Stirling. There's a stone carving of Mel Gibson in the classic Wallace pose outside the gift shop. It embarassing to see the tourists snapping pictures of the Hollywood replica. The real statue of Wallace is hidden in the background only visible to those who know it's there. Most of the tourists don't notice it, and it's sad. He deserves to be remembered for what he was, and not what Hollywood has made him.
B000069AUI|2.0|First off, I'd like to say that I am not into this brit-pop stuff AT ALL!  However, I decided to grit my teeth and give an album I knew I wouldn't thouroughly enjoy a fair review.  Another thing I must clear up is that this is not rock in any way....purely pop.  Now, onto my review.<br />   I had heard the song &quot;clocks&quot; played on the radio before (when I was younger, I somewhat enjoyed it).  If you're into a lot of piano, then you will like this particular song.  However, the lyrics are nothing but self-pity.  Here's an example: <BR>&quot;Lights go out and I can't be saved<BR>Tides that I tried to swim against<BR>Have brought me down upon my knees<BR>Oh I beg, I beg and plead.&quot;<br />  Give me a break!  No one gives two sh*ts about your problems!  I began to notice that most of Coldplay's lyrics did the same thing, or they were stupid and void of real meaning (for example, all of &quot;A Whisper&quot; talks about is how he wants to be with someone who has gone away.....wow, there's a meaningful song!  Geeezzz!  And half the song repeats two sets of three line phrases over and over again.  Get some meaningful lyrics for the love of God!).<BR>  Although their music is very boring to me, if you are a pop-lover who doesn't mind insipid lyrics, then I guess you will enjoy this album.  However, someone should introduce these guys to Tool (not only cause Tool knows how to write lyrics, but, seeing as how Coldplay seems to be a Christian band, if you've ever heard the song &quot;Eulogy&quot; by Tool, you'd know that Tool's message would be quite a slap in the face for these brit-pop stars!)
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Well, first things first:<br />1. I am a coldplay fan.<BR>2. This isn't a bias views.<br />This is a great CD/DVD. Its quite cool the way you can hear the crowds etc on the cd (no duh - it's recorded live), and it makes you feel more like you're acctually there. The dvd is really good, the lyrics options allow you to view single tracks of your choice which is great when you dont have long. The CD isn't compatible with all CD players etc but with the majority it'll play. It will play on computers, dvd players and most CD players, so you're safe.<br />The tracks chosen are a GREAT mix and the recording of &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; is BRILLIANT. I felt it was spoilt on Parachutes rather because of life is for living was on the end - YOU OUT THERE GUYS??? THEY'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Yeah, this is one great dvd a must have for coldplay fans and people who just enjoy their music too!
0446608955|5.0|Like the book A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY or Jackson McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, this Nicholas Sparks book is just the right balance of humor, sentiment, and real life.  I can honestly say that I've never encountered a Nicholas Sparks book I didn't like, but by far, this one is my favorite.  Touching without being sappy, and easy and fun to read without talking down to you, it's worth every cent!
B0000584V3|5.0|Excellent album by the most diverse &quot;death metal&quot; group out there. Mikael Akerfeldt has a stunning duality to his voice...one side offering a thunderous, roaring death metal vocal capability, while the other side showcasing a truly melodic, soaring, beautiful voice. Full of epic, complex song structures and mesmerizing melodies, this album is Opeth's masterpiece IMO. Even if you're not a fan of growling vocals (like I was), don't miss this...it's a horizon expander.
0385512104|5.0|This book reminded me of another I recently read: &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; by Jackson McCrae.  Both books deal with a precocious child that is overly intelligent, yet handicapped in some way. And both are a mystery of sorts with great writing and unusual form.  I would highly recommend both books, along with another I recently read--&quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (although that book is totally different from either of the aforementioned books.
B0000020C4|5.0|This cd is so magnificent you can't help but listen to it over and over again. Colm Wilkinson stuns me yet again in his role as Jean Valjean. Ruthie Henshall, despite what others may think, has an extraordinary voice and she is what I (and I believe that many others can agree with me) envisioned as Fantine. Hannah Chick is so adorable as young Cosette, despite the balloon popping in the middle of &quot;Castle on a Cloud&quot; and Adam Searles is the best Gavroche I have ever heard in my life. Philip Quast also delivers an unforgettable performance. Jenny Galloway and Alun Armstrong are perfect in the roles of Mme. and M. Thenardier. Micheal Ball, as always, performed flawlessly and Judy Kuhn (maybe not the best of the cast) was still an awesome performer. Finally, Lea Salonga (with a voice so much better than Frances Ruffelle) is the best Eponine on the face of the earth. They only allowed me five stars, but i would give this cd an infinite amount of stars.
0385504209|5.0|Not usually one for all the hype, I avoided this book for months.  That is, until a friend gave me a copy.  Perhaps it was because I was initially pessimistic; perhaps it was because I don't like to follow the crowd;  but for whatever reason I actually ended up liking this book.  Some of the &quot;facts&quot; Brown presents are fascinating and you can easily spend hours looking up the ideas on the Internet.  But aside from that the book is fast-paced and well, yes, it is a page turner (most chapter are only a page or two long, so you're forced to turn the page).  Still, it was much more enjoyable that I anticipated and worth a shot.  Whether or not you \\"believe\\" everything Brown tells you is up to you.  Just don't take anything too seriously and enjoy it.<br />Also recommended:  McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD
0380730367|5.0|'Prayers for Rain' is by far the best in the series.All of them are excellent reads of the highest order. This book has wonderfully rounded characters that even if you are not famililar with Angie and Patrick you'll still instantly feel like you know them.The story is excellent, the characters are excellent and as always Dennis Lehane has written another wonderful book.Hopefully he'll write another edition in the series but for now I'd recommend picking up Shutter Island or Mystic River.
0385510438|2.0|John Grisham's books tend to be easy to read.  Unfortunately, his latest books do not live up to &quot;The Firm&quot; or &quot;The Client.&quot; The plot of &quot;The Last Juror&quot; was so simple that it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess what would happen next.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this story line left you feeling unsatisified.  I compare it to going to a great restaurant and not getting enough to eat.  After plowing through 355 pages, you are left with a &quot;is that it?&quot; reaction. The ending wasn't enough to make you feel full when you left the table.
0962477060|3.0|Fretboard Logic SE is a valuable book and you'll understand a great deal more about the logic of the guitar's tuning and fret system within the first few pages but if you have small hands and/or short fingers you may find some of the alternate fingerings and barres required in this system to literally be beyond your reach. People with long fingers and/or average to larger than average hands will no doubt have an easier time of it.<br />Example: The standard way of learning an open G chord requires playing it with the index, middle and ring fingers (think 1st, 2nd and 3rd fingers) with the fourth finger (pinkie) along for the ride and possibly available to change the voicing within the chord or to maybe add a ninth (\\"A\\" above G). In the Fretboard Logic way of doing things the standard open G chord is played with the middle, ring and pinkie fingers (2-3-4) so as to leave the index available to \\"barre\\" in the moveable form as you go up the fretboard. This requires spanning the space of a full open fret with your index finger at the same time you are using fingers 2-3-4 to fret the E, A and E strings. I can't draw a picture here so it's best to pick up a guitar if you have one or draw yourself a picture of a fretboard to help visualize. Basically, if you can make that reach back with your index finger across a full fret while fingering with 2, 3 and 4 then this system should be fully workable for you. If you can't do it (and I can only manage it with difficulty), you'll still get a lot out of the book and increase your knowledge but portions of the system may well be \\"literally out of reach\\".<br />The CAGED system of moveable chords/positions really is rather brilliant. Even if you don't buy the book, borrow a copy from your local library or from a friend. There's nothing wrong with adding to your knowledge. If the system was totally workable for everyone I'd have rated it five stars. As it is, with limits on people (most women, children, young teens and some men) withsmaller than average hands, I can only go three. (Too bad Amazon doesn't have a way to go three and half.)
B00013F38K|4.0|'Kung Fu' was the hippest TV series when we were little kids in the early 70s, and it still holds up very well. Some of the best television film ever made.  Beautifully shot with fabulous camera work, great acting, and meaningful stories.  A ground breaking show in many ways.  'Kung Fu' presented themes and lessons of Zen, Taoist, Buddhist philosophy to an America in the early 70s that was still reeling from the Vietnam debacle.  Kung Fu imparted Eastern wisdom and ideas like chosing the paths of non-violence, humility, and stillness. All still good lessons in this post year 2000 age.  Many top guest actors included Will Geer, a very young Jodie Foster already showing considerable acting chops, and Gary Busey. You'll recognize many of the other actors throughout. Many top actors wanted to be in this show, because it was so remarkable for its time. The music scores are really amazing!  Real string sections, brass, woodwinds, ethnic instruments, with very advanced compositional techniques - at times very avant guarde.  Not a single synthesizer, sampler, or drum machine in earshot cluttering things up.  You NEVER hear big budget, high quality music scores like this on TV anymore.  Kung Fu was and still is a real mind, eye, and ear opener.  Check it out!  Loses one star for cropping for wide screen.
1565847032|4.0|This is the first work of any form of I've ever read of Chomsky and I picked it up as an afterthought.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  He has some very interesting and, more importantly, very unique ideas on a variety of social and political issues.  He is incredibly smart and doesn't engage in the pure logical fallacies or rantings that many in this genre do.  While I don't agree with a number of his ideas, they are challenging and require critical thought if you wish to dismiss them.<br />As a simplified example, he raises the point that it is a complete fallacy to retrospectively judge 20th-century socialism as a failure simply by comparing the status of past and present communist countries with capitalist ones.  At the turn of the century, Russia and most of Eastern Europe were extremely backwards in comparison to the West.  He posits that Russia was closer in economic and social development to Brazil than the U.S., and has similar population and natural resources, etc. to Brazil.  Brazil has been under the sphere of U.S. influence the last century, but compare Russia and Brazil today and you cannot roundly say the Russian system failed.  i.e., look at how much technological and scientific and industrial progress Russia made in the twentienth centurya and take a look at Brazil today.  Similarly, it is not proper to compare Eastern European nations to France or England; rather find countries that were comparable in their development when communism was instituted and compare those nations.  If you compare U.S. satellite nations, i.e. nearly all of Latin America, to Soviet satellite nations, today who can really say that Nicaragua or Venezuela is better off than Bulgaria or Hungary?  <BR>This is just one example of an idea that merits consideration and requires you to formulate your own reasons why you may disagree, rather than just denouncing him.  The only reason I would not give the book five stars is that the town-hall style presentation of the materialis distracting and times and makes some chapters a bit rambling.
0679405666|5.0|If you like the big, sprawling novels of the 19th Century, full of dozens of characters with a supporting cast numbering in the hundreds, novels like Dickens's Bleak House or David Copperfield, George Eliot's Middlemarch or either of the Tolstoy novels, then Vanity Fair may be for you.  I won't duplicate what other reviewers have already described below.  Instead I'll mention a couple of points that haven't received enough attention.<br />First, what sets this novel apart from others of its kind is the active role of the narrator, presumably the author himself, or perhaps an unnamed character.  Analogizing to sportscasts, this narrator is not content with doing the play-by-play; instead he(she?) constantly butts in with color commentary on the characters, exhortations to the reader, and rhetorical moralizing on such issues as men's treatment of women (bad), women's treatment of women (possibly worse), the harm that comes from living beyond one's means (which extends well beyond the spendthrift), and the question of what makes a gentleman and what makes a lady (honor and honesty).  This is all done with such a sense of irony, satire or sarcasm that it's hard to tell when the narrator is being serious.  It is this narrative distance from the characters that sets this novel apart from the sentimentality of Dickens, the earnestness of Eliot, the moral seriousness of Tolstoy.  I don't think this is cynicism on Thackeray's part but rather an unwavering commitment to seeing the world as it really is, unblinkered by any ideology, philosophy or religion.<br />The second point derives from the first.  There are no heroes or heroines, and no villains.  All of the characters, regardless of gender, age, class are possessed of both good and bad qualities.  Those on the good end of the spectrum are capable of bad acts:  Amelia exploits Dobbin's love, and Dobbin foolishly lets her.  Those on the bad end of the spectrum do good things:  Lord Steyne obtains a government post for Rawdon Crawley;  Becky Sharp Crawley brings about the reconciliation of Dobbin and Amelia.  Not only that, but after 800 pages and fifteen years the baddies end up about as well off as the goodies.  So what is the moral of this tale?  Well, it's the old saw that you should be careful of what you wish for, because you just might get it.  That caution applies even to such lofty goals as love and fidelity, and it goes double for fame and fortune.
B000089RVX|1.0|This band blows.  Their album is crap.  Their songs are mushy mixtures of rehashed power ballads with elements of neo-pop-contemporary-classicalism and a dash of female vox that are nothing spectacular if not normal.  Drop this in the waste disposal and check out Lacuna Coil instead if all you are really intersted in is a band that has a chic singer that rocks.
6305897786|4.0|I love this movie! Perhaps it is because I consider Satan and his friends to be about as real as the monster in the closet that scares you when you are about four years old. To me it comes across very strongly that the director was having a lot of fun scaring people with the boogeyman and very subtly winking at the audience and inviting them to join him in the joke. Great fun!

0767812166|5.0|After nearly 20 years, Starman is as timeless as ever. The music is haunting, Jeff Bridges is completely believeable in his role as an alien who needs to get home, and Karen Allen is superb as a lonely widow who helps him on his way. The movie is a nice mixture of humor as well as warmth, I'm surprised no previous reviewers have mentioned the scene involving the deer. I could have done with more extras, the DVD I have has just the trailers for &quot;Starman&quot; and &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;... no music video, no making-of, no commentary! But overall, this DVD shines. :-D
B000059HAI|5.0|And really, a ground-breaking film.  The format of the film set the tone and presentation for a host of war movies that followed (see 'Midway', for example).<br /><br />Based on research of Gordon Prange, author of \\"At Dawn We Slept\\", Tora! Tora! Tora! is a very accurate portrayal of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.<br /><br />There have been several treatments of the famous battle (as one-sided as it was), including the recent (and crummy) \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (2001).  This is the best.<br /><br />As other reviews have pointed out, the attack was an extremely successful one for the Japanese from a military standpoint.  By 1941, the only check on Japanese expansion in the Pacific was the United States Navy.  Yamamoto's plan was bold and creative, but it depended a lot upon luck, as the film and the book point out.  The United States had installed a radar facility that operated part-time, and did detect the first wave of incoming Japanese planes.  The US was more concerned with sabotoge, and parked their planes closely together.  The Japanese mini-submarine that was detected and sunk off Pearl Harbor should have raised alarms, but didn't.<br /><br />It all points to a fundamental principal of war.  Everyone got complacent.  We thought Pearl was too far from Japan to attract an attack of that magnitude.  We thought we would see the fleet or at least the Japanese planes long before they would present a threat.  Our technology (radar) provided an extra safeguard, but wasn't properly used. Our cracking of the Japanese diplomatic code provided an extra sense that we would know of an attack prior to it happening.<br /><br />I've read the transcript of the congressional inquiry into the attack that was undertaken in the late 1940s.  It is fascinating.  They point out one of the reasons we were complacent.  There had been 'war warnings' sent out several times in late fall 1941, warning of an imminent Japanese attack somewhere in the Pacific.  Nothing happened.  This bred a laissez-faire attitude toward imminent attack.<br /><br />The only thing that saved the US Navy was the US carriers were at sea, and that main target of the Japanese escaped unharmed, a fact that was to be of great importance to the subsequent conduct of the war.<br /><br />Some reviewers here have expressed surprise that the US was so badly fooled.  One reviewer here calls the US's actions 'slipshod and arrogant'.  Huh?  We prepared for the danger that we expected, not something nobody believed could have occurred. 'Blithely oblivious'?  Again, incorrect, as the proceedings of the congressional investigation have pointed out. 'Dry and boring'?  What movie did that reviewer watch? 'Incomprehensible decision' to park the planes closely together?  How about the dangers of sabotage?  'We didn't expect an attack'?  Not accurate at all.  The US was painfully aware of the danger Japan presented.<br /><br />The US attitude is understandable, though, when you realize they were viewing a far-off war in Europe, and no one then imagined a war in their own backyard.  It is hard to expect the unexpected.<br /><br />Very Highly recommended!ude toward imminent attack.

B00005JN1L|5.0|did make one mistake in attending this movie, it was either this or go see \\"The Passion\\". I thought that by going to see this I would not be as numb when I went to work. <br />What I saw on the screen didn't NUMB me so much as freak me out. I didn't dislike the experience even though it was a little stomach churning. <br />Any misgivings I had were washed away in the last 20 minutes. And if anyone gives the ending away i'll track you down and kill you myself.
B000000LZV|5.0|I got into the Minutemen about a year or so ago from a recomendation from a guy I mey on the internet.  I have this on vinyl, which is much better because of the 2 songs that they had to cut off for the CD, and the vinyl was 5 bucks cheaper, but I would sure as hell pay the extra 5 for this. <BR>Words can't describe this album, I don't think there is one low point on the entire record.  Mike and George are probably the best rythum section ever, and D.'s guitar work is just simply incredible.  <BR>I really do believe that the Minutemen are the greatest band ever, better than any of those bands like Zeppelin and the Beatles that always get all of the credit for that kind of thing.  This album is the finest effort from the greatest band ever.  I will never get bored of this.
B000002UEB|1.0|Now I may be slightly out of my element,but I have to say this stuff is definately not speed Power Metal like Midcareer Helloween or just Power Metal like Iron Maiden.It's more like Def leopard or Poison with bad lerics,and not to bad vocals.I mean Geoff Tate sounds pretty alright.But pretty much all the song's sucked to me.With the slight exceptions of Eyes of a stranger,and I don't believe in love.That had really mediocre verses,and just alright choruses,really I don't see what all the hoopla's all about.I mean if you like Glam,and bad song writting this is you'r album.I feel bad for knocking the Warning album by giving it a One,and a two,and by saying Michael Kiske is so much better of a singer than Geoff Tate,although he's my favorite Power Metal vocalist of all time,and really sound's atleast a good half or maybe even more like Geoff Tate,and Bruce Dickinson kind of jammed together with a good amount of his own crisp sounding vocal's.Anyway's,after listening to Warning abit more I see that,that album is much more of a must have for atleast Power metal fan's.And this album is more of a badly written,glammy sounding sell out album.I recommend the Warning album way,way more than this album,along with,maybe even more so,the Reigning Memories album from Ion Vein,the Black Majesty album Sand's of time,and also from the indie labeled band All to human the  Entropy.Plus ofcourse my all time favorite band Mid career Helloween.Not to mention Brainstorm,Nocturnal Rites,Iron Maiden,Dark moor,Blind Guardian,Firewind,Rhapsody,steel attack,and many,many more.

B000089CJI|5.0|To put it bluntly, I don't like electronic pop music. That's an extreme understatement, actually.  But this album, for whatever reason, blows me away.  Totally.  I'm not sure if I'm more blown away by the music or the fact that I like it at all.  lol  The music, the melodies, the lyrics, they're all great, some shockingly so.  I've rarely been so excited about music.  Couldn't be happier with it.  I'll recommend it to anyone and everyone.  :)
0316666343|3.0|The first chapter is so gripping that you have to keep reading.  However, the rest of the book falls flat.  The Lovely Bones owes much of its success to timing and topicality.  When it was first published there were (sadly) a number of similar cases in the news, and I think that inspired more interest in this book.  Beyond the first chapter it's fairly dull.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|...was without a doubt \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" and particularly the fight with the white haired guys which went on FOREVER and got absolutely nowhere. I really felt I'd wasted that two hours of my life (and I was dumb enough to waste even more on \\"Matrix Revolution\\" just in case they could pull it all together - they didn't.) <br />I point this out because some seem to think that superficial speed counts for more than believable content or characters drawn with any degree of emotion or intelligence.<br />As for \\"Lost in Translation\\" Slow? Perhaps. Because it needs to be. I'd say evenly paced. <br />Plenty of plot for those with the brain to see it. Wonderful performances. Great cinematography. Assured writing and directing from Sofia Coppola, who knows exactly what the story needs to be told well.
1400031001|5.0|What an odd book. Logan Gonzago Mountstuart was a (fictional) writer, spy, art dealer and all around rennaissance man who lived through the great events of the 20th century. This book is written as a diary, and, at first, one can find it a bit tedious, as the your Mountstuart writes clumsily about his experiences.<br />But quickly, this book becomes almost obsessive, as Boyd draws his character with subtle strokes. I was so drawn into this book that I found it hard to put down. Being the first Boyd novel I read, I didn't know what to expect, but I'm certainly going to read others. This character's life is interesting and inspiring, and watching him rise, fall, and finally die is deeply moving.
B000068QZK|3.0|No Rest for the Wicked was the first Ozzy album of the 1980s I did not care for.  It is not a bad album, it just was a step down from Ultimate Sin and Bark at the Moon.  Lyrically, it is very interesting with songs about Jimmy Swaggart, the Manson family, and a sequel of sorts to &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; in &quot;Demon Alcohol.&quot;  One can tell right away by comparing those two songs, though, that No Rest for the Wicked does not match up to the brilliant Blizzard of Oz.  The musicianship is great as always (this was the first album featuring guitarist Zakk Wylde) but the songs, for the most part, are not that stellar.  &quot;Miracle Man&quot;-about televangelist Jimmy Swaggart who cried on television when he admitted to sinning with several young ladies-is an excellent track but I find the distorted computerized voice in it very annoying.  &quot;Devil's Daughter&quot; is one of the better songs here but, &quot;Crazy Babies&quot; is not.  It has a good time rock 'n roll sound with its &quot;walk that walk, talk that talk&quot; that I am not looking for when I choose to play an Ozzy album.  <br />&quot;Breaking all the Rules&quot; brings back the heavier sound.  &quot;Bloodbath in Paradise&quot; (about Charles Manson) has its moments but seems to wimp out at &quot;but there's no where you can run to, baby.&quot;  &quot;Tattooed Dancer&quot; has a good time rock 'n roll sound with some pretty harsh, almost misogynist lyrics (though, I'm sure that is not what Ozzy intended).  The track that makes this album worth it, however, is &quot;Fire in the Sky.&quot;  It is amazing and is one of the best tracks I have ever heard by Ozzy.  It is better than anything on Bark at the Moon or Ultimate Sin.  In fact, I would only put the best tracks off of Diary of a Madman above it.  Trust me, it is that good.  &quot;Hero&quot; is included supposedly as an &quot;extra track,&quot; however I have it on my cassette release.  It follows &quot;Demon Alcohol&quot; but is not listedamong the tracks.  I always thought it was called &quot;Please Don't Go&quot; because that is the last lines of the song.  Anyway, for those who do not have it, it is a very nice song.  It is not a ballad, but it has a beauty to it.  Fans of Ozzy will no doubt find something  to savor on this album (as I did with &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;), so go ahead and pick it up. It is just not as solid as his previous releases.  Casual fans, however, may enjoy the live EP Just Say Ozzy more as it features better versions of three of the tracks off No Rest (including &quot;Miracle Man&quot;) as well as &quot;War Pigs&quot; and &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; with Wylde on guitar.
0156027321|4.0|Wasn't expecting too much when I first read about this:  It sounded like a combination of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and &quot;Old Man and the Sea.&quot; But I couldn't have been further off the mark.  It's nothing like those two books.  The story alone is great, but what Martel does with it is fantastic.  You might find yourself wondering about where it's going at times, but the end wraps everything up very nicely.  Would also recommend another book I've recently read called &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; as it too is an excellent read.  Also, &quot;Little Children&quot;--not along the same lines as these two, but just as good.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|I was disappointed in my first viewing of this film. I watched it on the same day as Whale Rider and Secondhand Lions, and frankly both are much better films.    However, after reading some of the wildly raving reviews, I went back and watched it again to see if I had somehow missed something. It did improve on the second viewing. I think I was put off by the pacing and general tone of the film on first viewing. I caught more of the subtle points the second time around, but still found that many important things passed too quickly (text of faxes, for example), while other things, such as the endless boredom scenes of Charlotte in her hotel room, went on way longer than needed to make the point.    I have to wonder if the film wasn't specifically designed to be vague in order to be some kind of Rorschach test for the person viewing it. It seems to me that we are actually told and shown very little about the two characters, and I think people are projecting a great deal when I read the reviews. For example, I didn't find the elevator scene where he was so much taller than everyone else to be racist so much as pointing out how he stood out as very different from everyone around him. It seemed to me to be about his isolation, not racism. (Maybe I'm projecting.........)    We know that the young woman, Charlotte, is in a marriage that no longer excites her. She hasn't \\"found herself\\" yet in life, and has reached a point of angst mixed with ennui that is not uncommon for someone her age as the hype fades and the bubble bursts. She is numb, bored, and in her own words, \\"stuck.\\" Life isn't fun or easy any more.    The aging actor, Bob, is portrayed as probably having a drinking problem, although that isn't completely clear. We do know that he is feeling burned out, his marriage is no longer supportive or comfortable, and that he is no longer getting the film roles that made him popular. It is strongly hinted that he is past his prime and on the way down, but still big enough to get 2 million dollars for an ad campaign. He also is numb and withdrawn from life.    The thing I realized on the second viewing is that these are not extraordinary people. They are not witty Neil Simon intellectuals gamely facing the trials and tribulations of life in an endlessly entertaining manner. They are painfully ordinary and caught in the doldrums of life. She turns to him for wisdom about her situation, but only gets things like, \\"I'm not worried about you,\\" or \\"You'll figure it out.\\" He has no wise words to make her life all better again.    He turns to her for some touch of youth and energy, and that doesn't work either. Both these people are stuck behind barriers of pain and boredom, and are neither secure nor open to honest emotional exchange. Their meetings are frequently awkward, and their conversations are usually halting and shallow. They do manage to grow because of each other, and that is good.    This movie isn't \\"Harold and Maude,\\" \\"Same Time Next Year,\\" or \\"Razor's Edge,\\" nor does it try to be. All the discussion about politics and Hollywood is neither here nor there. Did it deserve an Oscar? I don't honestly know. Oscars aren't exactly objective awards, and Sofia does have a famous Hollywood name. On the other hand, for a first movie, I don't think it is all that bad. It is different, gets its point across, and does tell a story, whether it is a story you want to hear or not. Making a movie is not at all easy, and I say Sofia did okay.    As far as the acting goes, it is easy to attack Johansson because her character is so ordinary, but have you considered how difficult it is to play \\"ordinary?\\" The actress who played the Hollywood starlet had a much easier job because her character was such a caricature. I think they all did okay. It was worth spending the time to see it twice and pick up what I missed. I doubt I would watch it a third time, though. I think all the hype did it more harm than good.    The thing that impressed me most washow well the film did at making me feel like an outsider in Japanese culture. I really got a sense of isolation and confusion with all the Japanese signs and no English words for reference, and the constant barrage of rapidly spoken Japanese. The film did a great job there. Watch it for that at least.    UPDATE: May 2011    After speaking with a younger colleague who absolutely loves this film, I have decided that there is probably a generational thing going on. He said it speaks very strongly to his life, and I value his opinion, so I am going to watch it a third time and see if I can detach from my point of view a bit and be more open to what appeals so much to his generation. (Always a good idea to listen and learn from those with whom we differ.) I will update this again after my next viewing.

B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is an outstanding film. It is a well written, well acted film dealing with many issues, such as survival of a tribal culture in the \\"modern\\" world, generation gaps, gender gaps, and family members understanding and supporting each other. It also deals with leadership and the difficulties involved in trying to chart a course for a group of people for whom you are responsible.<br />The central story of the film is the struggle of a young woman to gain acceptance from her grandfather. Wrapped around this is the story of tribal bloodlines and gender expectations. I can't really go into detail without spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that Keisha Castle-Hughes did a great job as the courageous young woman, and all the actors gave very believable performances. I was drawn into the story easily, and it kept my attention through to the end.<br />It is really nice to see more movies where women and girls are the heroes and get to show strong character development and great depth. Women have played very important roles in virtually every aspect of human history, and I feel cheated by the way they have been left out of historical tales. It is a never ending source of inspiration to discover yet another episode of women's contributions, and it is gratifying to see fiction giving them more due as well. Highly recommended.<br />Hey, is New Zealand the next film capital of the World, or what? Go Kiwis!

0385504209|1.0|In school I was told that every book should at least have one round character for it to be interesting. In The Da Vinci Code, all the characters are as flat and unappealing as roadkill. No character development whatsoever is present, and the motivations of both protagonists and antagonists are wafer thin (pun intended).<br />What's worse, although the plot starts off sort of promising, it soon starts te develop along the lines of the Hollywood Assembly Line. The fact that each and every character turns out to be connected one way or another is not only not credible, but annoying as well. The same goes for the (little) cliffhangers at the end of every chapter.<br />The pieces of the plot fit together to easily to make this book a captivating read - all the interesting facts on religion and Da Vinci notwithstanding, and the way the plot is resolved at the end of the book left me feeling cheated.<br />For me, the letdown started approximately two-third trough the book, in a scene where the identity of The Teacher is revealed because of Dan Brown trying to hard not to. To add insult to injury, near the end of the book Mr. Brown, evidently feeling the need to show to the reader just how clever he has been, once more returns to this scene to explain what &quot;really happened&quot;.<br />If you're looking for an easy to digest holiday read for those hung over mornings on the beach, and you're easy to please, maybe The Da Vinci Code does fit your bill.
B0000025RI|5.0|Wow...WOW!! This album is just amazing. Now'a'days, the King of Pop isn't that popular, so it's easy for people to not like his albums, but it's very hard for people to stay away from THIS album!! &quot;Thriller&quot; Is the biggest hit album, and it's just oustanding. Here is what I think of it's 9 amazing tracks:<br />1. &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot; (10/10) Amazing song. It shows MJ's powerful funkiness. It really stands out amongst the others because of the end when everybody starts to chant &quot;Mama se, Mama sa, mama sa coo sa...  (etc.)&quot; Great Start to a great album.<br />2. &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; (9.7/10)-- I don't like slow songs, but this is a cute slows one. It's nice and I like the background noises, it sound Technoish....<br />3.&quot;The Girl is Mine&quot; (10/10) I love this song. It's my favorite love song (unless you count &quot;Billie Jean&quot; as a love song). I never was a fan of the Beatles so it was nice hearing Paul Mcartney. I really like the &quot;arguement&quot; (slash conversation) between Michael and Paul!!<br />4.&quot;Thriller&quot; (15/10) ...........This song is.....AMAZING!! My favorite MJ song, and it's the reason I started  and just loved this song. In high school, my friends gave me the nickname &quot;Thriller Girl&quot; cause my love of this song!! A definate classic!! &quot;Cause It's a Thriller!! Thriller night...girl I can thrille you more than any ghost would ever dare try...&quot;<br />5.&quot;Beat It&quot; (15/10) ANother amazing song..I'm gonna have a heart attack these are so amazing!! I had to make a dance to this song for school, I had so much fun. But still...This is so amazing, Especially  Van Halen's guitar solo. I first heard this song  watching &quot;Undercover Brother&quot; and I loved it!! Another TRUE classic! &quot;Showing how funky and strong is ur fight! It doesn't matter whose wrong or right!!&quot;<br />6.&quot;Billie Jean (14.5/10): *NOtices staring* What?? I didn't absolutely die for this song. It is very funky but I didn't love it. What?? Sorry......*Crawls into the corner* It is Jackson's definate best though...but I don't like it as much as Thriller and Beat It.<br />7.&quot;Human Nature&quot; 8.6/10 I didn't love it...<br />8.&quot;P.Y.T.&quot; 9.9/10: VERYYYYY GOOOOD.<br />9.&quot;The Lady in My Life&quot; 8.1/10.....Ahh good enough...<br />GO OUT AND GET THIS ALBUMM!!!!!is song. It is very funky but I didn't love it. What?? Sorry......*Crawls into the corner* It is Jackson's definate best though...but I don't like it as much as Thriller and Beat It.<br />7.&quot;Human Nature&quot; 8.6/10 I didn't love it...<br />8.&quot;P.Y.T.&quot; 9.9/10: VERYYYYY GOOOOD.<br />9.&quot;The Lady in My Life&quot; 8.1/10.....Ahh good enough...<br />GO OUT AND GET THIS ALBUMM!!!!!
B000001U3K|4.0|Lou Reed's music on Transformer seems to bring out the inner city vibe of New York City.  Lou's imagery is quite intriguing if a bit quirky as he introduces you to the many characters in his world.<br /><br />The big hit here is Walk On The Wild Side. I like the booming bass, steady rhythm guitar and rapping style vocals.  The ending saxaphone solo is oh so appropriate.  But there is so much more than this fine single.  Viscious, I'm So Free, and Hangin' Round are good steady rockers.  However Lou's style touches on cabaret jazz with the brief New York Telephone Conversation, Satelite of Love, and the album closer Good Night Ladies.  I truly like the use of the Tuba throughout.<br /><br />Whereas Lou Reed is not much of a singer, somehow he evokes the right style with his quiet muffled rap.  He does waver a little off key in spots but somehow it does not offend his audience too much as he keeps a low key style.  As another writer noted, Lou's performance on Perfect Day is quite good.<br /><br />All things consider this is a fine recording that should not be overlooked.  A solid four stars for sure.
B00013F38K|5.0|Like many of the reviewers, this is my favorite TV show of all time. I have practiced chinese martial arts for 16 years and my initial interest was, without a doubt, fueled by my memories of this show as a kid. <br />The show itself is very well done -- both the philosophy and the technical aspects. Many of the techniques seen in today's action shows (both TV and movies) have been &quot;borrowed&quot; from the pioneering work done in this show. For example, in an era in which martial arts movies used artificially accelerated fight sequences, Kung Fu slowed things down (has anyone seen The Matrix?) -- they weren't afraid to display the techniques and they weren't out to impress anyone with how fast they could move.<br />The stories/episodes are not cliche' and are well thought out. I guess some people may be put-off by that -- they want black-and-white, good-v.-evil situations with pre-canned dialog heavily interspersed with brutal fight scenes (ala Jet Li or Steven Segal) -- this show is not for them. Here is portrayed the softer side of the real kung fu. Also, the episodes get better as the show progresses. The original pilot and first episode are a little rough -- but remember they were innovating a whole new type of show, so it took a little practice before they got it right (just like real kung fu).<br />The acting is some of the finest I have seen on the small screen. Say what you wish about David Carradine, but he is the consummate Kwai Chang Caine. The character actors are superb as is the regular cast.<br />The picture quality of this DVD is phenomenal. I was expecting some poor quality, grainy picture -- thinking that this show was filmed 30+ years ago. It is simply amazing what they have done with digital remastering.<br />Last but not least, the extra special features are very interesting and informative. Many of the original personnel -- those behind the camera, as well as in front of it -- give their own fascinating perspective on all the details involved in the show.<br />All in all, many hours of great viewing! I cannot wait for the release of the next two seasons.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|I had high hopes that this would be an original movie, but it turns out that my exitement got the best of me. <br />Ever since The Ring came out, everybody wants to use the &quot;Girl who got killed and decides to help other victims&quot; scenario. I mean this movie is so obvious, that its like a Ring parody. <br />The Ring has turned into The Matrix for horror movies. Everybody wants to use the supernatural girl who had a bad life and turns into a ghost to seek vengeance on her killers while at the same time, helping someone else....much like Bullet-Time in all the recent action movies. Why cant Hollywood be more original?<br />The Matrix and The Ring are probably the two smartest movies in the past ten years, and I can prove it by saying the following thing: THEY HAD A GOOD CONCEPT AND WERE EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE, AND THEREFORE, EVERYBODY WANTS TO COPY IT TO MAKE MONEY AS WELL. The problem with this is simple: Gothika was crap, and the people who wrote it were sell-outs for wanting to make money off of an idea that was already created. This movie could have been so much more, but instead, they went for the easy &quot;surprise&quot; ending that has been used so many times, it cant even be called a &quot;surprise ending.&quot; I figured it out within an hour.<br />So theres a guy that rapes girls in mental institutions? Well, heres an idea, DO A DNA TEST!!<br />Yawn.<br />If I wrote this movie, here's how I would do it:<br />Halle Berry is a psychologist who thinks that Penelope Cruz is crazy. Halle is driving home when she sees the blonde girl and crashes her car. Then, we cut to her in the mental institution and see that Halle Berry has suddenly become a crazy person too. But the surprise ending is: HALLE BERRY ISNT REALLY A PSYCHOLOGIST.....SHE REALLY IS AN INSANE PERSON AND THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WERE JUST A HALLUCINATION!<br />Why couldnt they just do that? At least its original and not a Ring rip-off.<br />So all in all, I suggest you see THE RING, the movie that started it all. Its brilliant and is completely original, and is far better than Crapika - Oops, I meant Gothika.
0800179501|3.0|Ralph Macchio is one of the worst actors Hollywood ever put on the screen. He either overacts everything or is a complete ham. This movie is the pinnacle of his career. This flick is about as realistic as a Friday the 13th movie.<br />First of all I cannot believe a karate school run by a sensai as portrayed in this movie could possibly exist. No one is going to pay hard earned money for that kind of abuse. Secondly, a karate student abusing his skills on people would be severely punished or banned from further classes. The sensai in this movie is a stereotypical loon left over from the Vietnam War. The only viewing pleasure this movie has is Mr. Mayagi. Pat Morita is not the propritor of Al's anymore from Happy Days. He plays a wise and noble charactor that has to cool the jets of hot headed Ralph.<br />The final contest is a bit far-fetched and the final blow has become a cliched joke.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|If you liked the Ring then you've gotta see this. Gothika is an intelligent, at times scary ride with a few curves and detours in the road. Maybe I'm not as astute as some others who have seen this flick, but it kept me guessing pretty much till the end. Like the Ring, the story reveals itself through a series of mysterious circumstances that the main protagonist, Halle Berry, solves with you. Each scene leads to another question that must be resolved. <br />My only negative comment is on Berry's performance. She is not really convincing as a psychiatrist. This is partly due to her stunning beauty which, in this case, is a distraction from her character along with her overly dramatic emotionalism.<br />All in all though, this is a great film and I will actually purchase it on the after market for my personal library... And place it on the shelf right next to The Ring!
B000059Z8J|5.0|A great movie concerning the origins of 'The Man of Steel'. Christopher Reed will always be Superman in the eyes of many people. I have no complaints about the movie it's great. However, never in my life have I seen a movie with such long opening credits. I've never timed it, but I swear the outer space sequence with the constant 'Whoosh' of names just goes on forever. I still remember seeing this in the theater with my parents. As soon as the credits began I had to go to the bathroom. My dad took me and then we waited in line for snacks and drinks for the rest of the family. I was edgy because I didn't want to miss a second of Superman. After what seemed an eternity, we made it back to our seats. We had time and a half to spare. My mother then went to the ladies room, she came back and the credits STILL flew on the screen. My dad commented &quot;I think everybody made this movie&quot;. The crowd around us began to laugh.
0790729628|5.0|I've read the book and agree with most that the director's cut is more in tune with the book. The director's cut changes some crucial parts to the original movie such as the ending not being so happy as the original, and the question that maybe Deckard was a replicant himself. <br />That being said, I also loved the original. Yes the narration in the original was cheesy-sounding, but it all made up for it with the final scene when Roy Batty dies. The narration added a very powerful emotional edge to that scene, the likes of which is rarely duplicated in movies. That emotion is missing in the director's cut due to the narration being gone. For that reason alone I will always prefer to watch the original over the director's cut. even though the director's cut is a fantastic versionin its own right.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|Wesley Snipes is not a bad actor, so I don't know why he was so terrible in this. The more I watched this movie the more aggravated I became, espescially when everyone around me thought this was the greatest movie they ever saw. Typical sheep who'll accept anything in front of them as entertainment. This was just a poor script, with a lot of hammy acting.
B000000W5N|5.0|This is the best album i've ever listened to. Every song is brilliant, it's pure rock'n roll throughout from the greatest  band ever. Although Sticky fingers is not my personal favourite stones album [let it bleed] it's truley stunning. When i first listened to the album I was blown away, then played it again, but louder. For me the songs that really stand out are Wild horses, Sway and Sister Morphine. The stones are a breath of fresh air for me [I'm 18] because i'v been brought up through a period of poor music, with a few exceptions. This album is attracting the youth of today [me] over 30 years after it was produced, how many bands of today will match that. IN ANOTHER 30 YEARS  WHEN THE STONES ARE LONG GONE PEOPLE WILL STILL PURCHASE THESE GREAT ALBUMS Five out of five. 100/100.
6302402824|5.0|ZZ Top's videos are all about two things. Hot, blazing guitar riffs that hook you like a catfish, and hot, hot, hot, beautiful women! How can you go wrong with that? (...) Now that's hot stuff! All the classic 80's hits are here.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but i'm gonna buy it. But just from seeing the previews i can tell it's a scary movie, believe me i've seen the exorcist. anyway it's one of the best of all scary movies i i've heard of a seen a bit of. and i've seen 4 of 5 worth while seeing movies.
B00008438V|5.0|This is another movie from the best decade in recorded history. Sure it's far out, unbelievable, and silly, but that's why we love it. I remember when this movie first came out Kelly LeBrock (The creation) was supposed to be 'the next big thing'. But hey, who wouldn't their woman going into a lingerie store and asking &quot;Do you have this in black leather or barbed wire?&quot;<br />Anthony Michael Hall is 'Dr. Frankenstein' and along with his dweeb partner, create the perfect woman with a Barbi Doll and a computer that could barely play Pong without crashing. My God do you remember those 5.25 inch floppy diskettes??<br />Well what else do we have, grandparents get frozen in a closet, the bully big brother turns into a green mucus pile with eyes, a clean Robert Downey Jr., a British Mad Max motorcycle gang in the living room, and oh yes, a nuclear missle growing out of the basement and through the roof.<br />Some things are dated, but boys wearing bras on their heads will never go out of style.
0780626966|5.0|This one of the best horror series and Freddy is my favorite horror villian.  Some of these movies will make you laugh, and some will make you scared, but what ever your fear is, Freddy knows it best.  This series is a bit better than the Friday The 13th series and way better than the Halloween series.  The Halloween series screwed itself up 4 times and that makes a pretty bad series.  I really only like the first two in the Halloween series.  But all of these are great films and don't let you down.  Wes Craven introduced us to the villian Freddy back in 1984, 20 years ago.  That's so long ago, and yet the series still goes on today.<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street- This was the best of the series no doubt.  It's gory, creepy, scary and a little bit funny.  The special effects are great in this film.<BR>10/10<BR>Rated R for violence, strong gore, langauge and brief nudity.<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 2- This film really stands with pride, but not nearly as much pride as others in the series.  It still was gory and creepy, but just didn't have the magic of the first one.<BR>7/10<BR>Rated R for graphic violence, gore, strong language, drug use and brief nudity.<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 3- This is just as good as the first one and really makes up for the mistakes in the second one.  It is creepy and quite funny.<BR>10/10<BR>Rated R for gore, violence and nudity.<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 4- This film is where Freddy becomes quite funny, and I was one of the people who didn't care that he bacame funny, cause it was still gory and creepy.<BR>8/10<BR>Rated R for violnce, gore, language and nudity.<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 5- This was an ok film but was my least favorite of the series and made the first one look like oscar material.  It was still funny and creepy, but no where near gory.<BR>6/10<BR>Rated R for graphic violnce and language.<br />Freddy's Dead- This was another great entry in the series and was very funny and was much much gorier than the5th one.  This is a great deal in this box set.<BR>8/10<BR>Rated R for violence and mild gore.<br />New Nightmare- The return of Craven made this movie a gem.  It wasn't funny, but it was good creepy gory fun that was exciting and had a great cast.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated R for violnce and gore.<br />So get this box set................NOW.
B00001MXXH|3.0|When making a list of popular teen movies from the 80's, 'Ferris Bueller' is always in the top ten. That may be well and good, but it never appealed to me the way 'The Breakfast Club' did. Now I say right off the bat that Mia Sara was absolutly beautiful, she steals the scenes she's in away from Matthew. She is the only reason I ever watch this when it comes on TV.<br />John Hughes may be known for his far out movies (Weird Science), but this one just goes over the top a tad. When 'Get Well Ferris Banners' are displayed in the city, that's when I usually lose my patients with this flick. However the restaurant scene with the snooty Matrie'D is very good.<br />Check out the cameo of a very young Charlie Sheen at the police station.
B00012QM8G|3.0|I disagree with the majority of viewers.  This is no masterpiece.  It is a pretty good movie with a story that is moving. <br />Spielberg never uses subtlety.  He hits you over the head with each point and I find it insulting to a viewer's intelligence.  Shots linger too long... characters explain their actions..<br />If you can get over Spielberg's in your face style this is a great and sometimes moving story.  The acting is above average but nowhere near approaches the performances in &quot;Sophie's Choice\\", &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; or even the made for TV mini series &quot;Holocaust&quot;<br />This movie is worth seeing but given the choice I would first view the others I have mentioned.
B000059XUI|5.0|This is a great flick where Superman must fight three evil beings from his former home planet. The fight in New York and Superman's hideaway are entertaining and exciting for the whole family. Gene Hackman though as Lex Luthor steals the show. He's hilarious as he battles and makes alliances with both Superman and Zod. He's great. Of course the rest of the gang, Lois, Jimmy, and the Chief are back for this sequel that does not disappoint.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Leonard Turdley is a idiot!!! Rolling Stone magazine just named the Beatles as the number one artists off all time,and this album is a pretty good reason why!
B00005Y7PS|1.0|Without a doubt, this is the worst album ever to bear the mighty Black Sabbath name. 'Feels Good to Me' was an extremely poor choice as a single. Tony Iommi can still rock and rule the doom metal world, but the songs were weak. I do not like the Tony Martin era at all, Cross Purposes is the only solid album they managed to do with Tony Martin.
B00005YU1O|5.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; is fantastic. The animation alone pulls you in, but it's the philosophies that keep you in. This is the kind of movie that makes more sense each time you watch it. &quot;Waking Life&quot; will not only inspire you to think, but also to dream.
B000002LUB|5.0|After mediocre and poor albums fronted by Tony Martin, Dehumaizer was a breath of fresh air. You could just see the mighty Sabbath Beast coming up through the ground ready to conquer again. Dio, Tony, Geezer, and Vinnie put together a steller album that destroyed anything Sabbath had done since Born Again.<br />Songs like Computer God, Time Machine, and TV Crimes, are a punch in the face that will rock your world. However, my favorite song by far is 'I'. Whenever I hear it I want to tear down walls and beat the hell out of anything I'm near.<br />I saw the Dehumanizer Tour in Tampa with Testament opening. Sabbath put on one of the best shows I had ever seen them do. Dio's writing and singing skills fit Sabbath like a glove. Unfortunately, egos surfaced again and the mighty reunion did not last. At least we have what they did when they were together.
0783225849|4.0|Warning *SPOILERS*! The main one is in this review. So I advize you if you have not seen it, do not, I repeat, DO NOT READ THIS! If you do it'lljust ruin, the twist,so as a movie watcher I ask to not read this if you haven't seen this. <br />Let me start off by saying, I am 10 years old,and from what I've noticed other kids don't have respect for classics. I took this to my friends house, and she's 13, first she said the music in the beggining was awsome (which is true) but 20 minutes into the movie, she said &quot;This is boring.&quot; I know she has her own opnion, and blah, blah, blah. But this aint her review. It's mine, hense, I tell my own opnion.HA! So I looked at her in disguest. She obviously has no respect for horror/thriller/study into paranoi, movies. She's more into slashers. Which I'm all for, but sometimes they overdo the gore. I like slashers yeah, I mean, my personal favoirte horror movie is &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street.&quot; Yes that is a slasher, BUT, it has a psychologocal depth. Same with Final Destination, because in that slasher, people get killed, and there is no killer. You Have to see it to understand. Whatever, but the worst part was she said the shower scene was crap! ARGGGH!It was 1960! Don't expect as much blood as you did in Scream. Well that is done. But here is the spoiler, so if you haven't seen it yet DO NOT read this. Okay. You know how at the end the guy was just really a well...Psycho...because he was a skizo and one of his personalities is &quot;His mother&quot;. Well, when the shower scene first came on, I was watching this movie with my mom and I said, &quot;YOu know what'd be weird? If the guy was a skizofrenyic and thought he was his mother.&quot; And oh my god! I was right. I swear to god, it was so weird, but so cool!<br />Okay so overall, the movies really good, and is worth watching.<br />Maybe I am &quot;Psych&quot;ic
B000002KIE|5.0|I'm not saying that stupid people love the Sex Pistols. What I'm saying is this....<br />I bought this album way back in 1988 on the advice of a friend. I was deep into heavy metal, but liked the Ramones. A friend suggested I pick up the Sex Pistols. I loved Megadeth's \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" version and was curious to know what the original sounded like. Well after all these years I still love this album.<br />Before the internet, there was very little I knew about Johny Rotton and the gang. They were never in magazines like Hit Parader, Circus, or Metal Edge. You never saw them on MTV. I didn't even know that Sid Viscious did not play on this album! Now of course you can find out anything you want to know about these guys from the internet (espescially Amazon.com reviews). I had no idea that they were a British punk version of The Monkees. I didn't know they were a joke band created only as a money making gimmick. To tell you the truth, I ignore all that.<br />There is only one Sex Pistols album and this is it. If you only know the music, you will enjoy this album. There are songs on here that have been covered by many great bands (Motley Crue, Megadeth, Motorhead). SO whoever was responsible for these songs, definately had some song writing talant that lasted the test of time. Hey for all it's worth, this album by itself is a punk monster to be reckoned with.
B00005B36H|1.0|That Schism song sucks ass its easily the worst song I've ever heard. When it came on the radio I wanted to rip my ears off!
B000002J1M|5.0|This album is pretty much the first album where Genesis realized their talent and used it perfectly. From Watcher Of The Skies to the incredible Supper's Ready, this album is amazing songwriting coupled with incredible chops, making for the perfect prog album. If you're new to Genesis, start with Selling England By The Pound, but this one needs to be purchased. Absolutely essential.
B00008H2LB|2.0|These guys are really starting to annoy me. I still like them and all, its just that their extremely overhyped. I mean come on people, they play the same guitar riffs over and over and never have any good bridge parts or solos. Their drummer isn't fantastic and their bassist can barely be heard. Their lyrics may be &quot;deep&quot; and all but their just too frickin boring to even care. I mean the lyrics sound the same in every song, and the music sounds pretty similar too. I do like their DJ and Chester has a good voice but thats not enough to make them &quot;the band of the decade&quot; as alot of people have already been calling them. It doesn't help that &quot;Numb&quot; (a mediocre song to start) is being played on Pop and Rock stations all over the U.S. every 20 minutes... LP is a great live band I got to give them that. This CD didn't live up to Hybrid Theory, maybe LP got caught up in all the hype surrounding them by their army of 13-21 year old male fan base that thinks LP is &quot;HARDKORE!!1&quot;. I do recommend buying this CD, just don't expect anything amazing thats all. Peace out.
B000002NE4|5.0|If you missed out on this one when it was released as I did, don't forever rue the day, correct your error now. The Boatman's Call is the shining pearl buried for so many years in Nick Cave's irritated soul. &quot;Into My Arms&quot; is one of the most beautiful, poignant songs ever written and the cd's caliber drops little from that auspicious beginning. This is not &quot;essential Nick Cave&quot; it's just essential. A classic piece of music for the ages.
0446530891|1.0|I am a big fan of Baldacci's other books.  Not this one.  Split Second combines horrible dialogue, a ridiculously improbable story line, and an absurdly laughable ending.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I finished it only because my wife said I had to read the ending because I would not believe it made it into a book. If you have to read a Baldacci right now, re-read Absolute Power.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Would you believe I never saw this before, even though I grew up in the 80s?  I saw it last night for the first time on DVD.  Movies like this just don't exist anymore.  It is a testosterone filled, thumb-your-nose-at-the-establishment fantasy.  And it is so gloriously 1980s and so gloriously John Carpenter.<br />At the time, I would imagine the special effects and the concept were radical.  As it was set in the future in 1997 (being that it was 1981 when it was released) and that we are several years passed that 'future' things are obviously not quite what you see.  And the special effects are also a bit dated.  But just put yourself back when it was made and dream a little.<br />As for the movie itself, it's a really cool idea.  New York City a walled penitentiary where you are checked in and you don't leave.  Radical.  So the President ends up inside the prison walls and Kurt Russell, about to be checked in there, is called upon to get him out.  Off we go...<br />It's a wild ride.  It's filled with great one liners and borders on campy but it's still a classic in every sense of the word.  It just hovers around poking fun at itself but never quite goes there which makes it an action movie with a cynical bite.  And this has to be one of the greatest sets every used in a movie.  Burned out, abandoned and dark it fits the movie perfectly.  It really is a well crafted gem.<br />The extras make the DVD well worth the visit.  Included is a scene not found in the movie which only gets a brief mention in the film - the reason Kurt Russell's character ends up there.  This was apparently to be the opening scene in the movie but never made it.  Definitely worth watching.  The documentary is kind of cool as well.  Good stuff.
B00005OM4N|3.0|As every long-lasting artist does after a few years of fame &quot;Britney&quot; is Britney Spears 'in-between' album, where vocal quality drops and tracks begin to get edgier. The album starts on a perfect note, the Neptunes moaning/groaning &quot;Slave 4 U&quot; gets you in the mood with its wild beats and breathy vocals. Then &quot;Overprotected&quot; kicks in with a more of a pop feel than &quot;Slave&quot;, but catchy and worthy none the less. Then Britney strikes with a rocky pop song where she takes control. The Neptunes second produced track &quot;Boys&quot; slides in with the wilder rnb beats after everyone wakes up from the dido penned track &quot;Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman&quot;. The next 7 tracks become a dissapointing blur, untill you listen for a second time when 4 of those tracks come alive, the interesting cover &quot;I Love Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; and the fantastic rocky introducing &quot;Let Me Be&quot;.<br />On the whole &quot;Britney&quot; is a good album, but not great. There are standout tracks, but no huge hits.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|There is something undeniably ferocious about the music of At the Drive In. &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; is a nonstop assault on the ears from beginning to end, barely allowing the listener a breath through the agressive guitars and scathing lyrics. This band sings about issues that are real in this world, following in the footsteps of Rage Against the Machine, and they indeed stake their claim as the heirs to the music-political throne that Rage has now left vacant. <br />The highlight of the album is the song &quot;Invalid Litter Dept.&quot;, a slower number that is filled with harsh lyrics about death and horrible working conditions. The lyircs &quot;Choking on the corpes ashes&quot; says enough about this song, but it is one that needs to be heard, because it drips with talent. It is truly unfortunate that At the Drive In has since disbanded, as it seemed that this group was ready to explode onto the world of rock. Their follow up projects are also very good (Sparta, the Mars Volta), but there has not been a complete recapturing of what made this ATDI album so great. Agression, and raw punk energy, along with tons of skill and the ability to construct an intelligent song. <br />At the Drive In will be missed, but &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; is a great way to remember how good they were, and how good they could have been if they had continued on.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'm not a fan of Ms.Britney but I've listened to the album and it's great.But, if you want a great album then get Janet Jackson's &quot;Damita Jo&quot;, that's a hot album in stores March30th!!!
B0001ENYKS|4.0|This is a very solid album, with Franz Ferdinand offering up a nice mixture of 80's pop influences, along with others such as euro-pop, ska, straight up dance and upbeat acoustic songs. The sound is hard to describe, but this album is well worth a few listens, because this band is offering up something quite different than the regular rock that we have become too accustomed to. <br />There is alot of talent in this band, and hopefully their eclectic style of rock can catch on so that they may have the long career that can continue to develop young artists such as Franz Ferdinand.
B00006CXXU|3.0|Love this album, much better than Britney's &quot;In The Zone&quot; but check out Janet's album &quot;Damita Jo&quot; in stores March 30th
0060955775|1.0|If you like cheap literature and you are lazy reader this is a great book. Easy to digest! There is no profound literary education in this work. Cheap literature for cheap readers!!!!
B00009RAJH|5.0|The overall album is awesome!<BR>Monday Morning: Good song to start out with, upbeat, not one of Lindsey Buckingham's best songs though<BR>Warm Ways: Not a favorite, but its a pretty good Christine song<BR>Blue Letter: Love it<BR>Rhiannon: There are no words to explain the greatness of this song<BR>Over My Head: okay, i'm not a huge fan of Christine songs<BR>Crystal: LOVE IT, its Lindsey's best song on the album<BR>Say You Love Me: okay<BR>Landslide:Again, no words to explain this song<BR>World Turning: LOVE IT<br />Sugar Daddy: okay<BR>I'm so Afraid: Lindsey rocks out<BR>Bonus features:<BR>there all pretty good.

B000099T2L|4.0|Best tracks on this CD:<BR>Me, Myself &amp; I - everyone has heard this song, slow but i like it a lot<BR>Hip Hop Star - This has to be my favorite song on this CD i thought it would be the next single but seriously i love this song<BR>Baby Boy - Of course everyone has heard this song its great a little overplayed but i still like it<BR>Naughty Girl - one of the best songs on this album, just became a single...took me a while to like it but now I love it<BR>Crazy In Love - I Love this song!<BR>I think this album is pretty much worth it, I just mentioned my main favorite songs but if you like Beyonce I think you will like this album.
B0000024K1|5.0|Let me first start out by saying rap is a new thing for me. I generally listen to metal (sludge, doom, death, black, power) and hardcore punk. The next thing is that this cd is awsome. Funked out beats and very powerful lyrics. I also have to dissagree with the people that say they are racist. They arent just because they mistrust our goverment, (and rightfully so) dosent mean they are racist. They teamed up with Anthrax, remember? Im not going to do a song by song review, but let me say &quot;Black steele in the hour of Chaos&quot; is one of the best songs ever written. If you want a fast paced cd that packs a punch than this is for you. The lyrics arnt for the ignorant. Well perhaps they are and thats why they were written in the first place. Defiant, angery, and politaclly charged all the way. Greate cd.
0060545682|5.0|Excelent book. Great spanish. It remainded me of my homeland. This was the first time time I've read great spanish (Garcia Marquez excluded) from a writer who lives in USA. I gave Ms Allende's books to all my gringo nephews and nieces for Christmas.They fell so ashamed of their patois spanish. I'm happy to hear they want more books in &quot;castellano&quot;. I highly recomend this book to all those who call themselves &quot;spanish&quot; teachers. No way in the book you'll find the word OK nor &quot;de&quot; before a verb!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I am a huge TARANTINO fan. As of October 10, 2003 (KILL BILL's opening in theaters), My favorite movie, at the top of my list, was KILL BILL VOL.1. This is probably the most entertaining movie in the world. There are a lot of people that criticize this movie for having a very simple plot, a large amount of violence, and barely any moral to it. Dont worry about all that psychological mumbo jumbo crap that all those so-called movie experts want. A movie expert should respect every form of cinema. Who cares if it has the simplest plot ever made, who cares what all the other people say about it. A lot of people say that it is TOO violent, there's TOO \\"language\\" in it, there's TOO much this.. There's TOO much that. Who cares?!!! It's what we want to see, and it's the best movie i've ever seen. This movie has everything there is to offer in a good movie. It has action, humor, blood, and somewhat of a romance. Buy this movie... it's worth it.(...)
0393307050|4.0|I most definitely think that these books are not projected toward my age level. Granted, I've always read at least a few notches above my reading level (Which is, as of now, a sophomore in high school), but this is one of the first books that I have really felt out of my depth in.<br />I was provoked into buying the first book in the Aubrey/Maturin series because the movie by the same name had caught my interest. I was intrigued by all the goings-on of a British man-of-war, and the characters had already captured my heart. Upon hearing that the movie was actually based off of a 20-book series, I immediately ran to my closest bookstore and wrenched a copy of &quot;Master and Commander&quot; from the bookshelf. As soon as I opened to the display of a ship and its sails, I knew I was in for a trip.<br />This book, for me, was a huge eye-opener. It let me peer into the past, looking over the shoulders of the exciting characters Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin. I had always been interest in reading historical fiction, but this book caught me by surprise. Save for the diagram of the ship's masts and sails, there was no explanation of the nautical terms sprinkled throughout the book. I found myself skimming some sections, trying to find some words that I understood. Eventually, about 2/3 of the way through, I began piecing all of the terms together, looking a few of them up online. It was a tough obstacle, but I managed to clear it.<br />Bottom line is this: I have now read through the first three books, and so far, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; has been the hardest for me to read. And now that I understand more of the terms O'Brian used, I am falling more and more in love with these books. If you are a fan of the sea, ships, historical fiction, and/or excellent writing, I suggest this book with all of my heart. Happy reading!
B000002J2F|5.0|Well, I know this preference is highly influenced by the fact that this was the first Genesis' album I listened to, some years ago. I've become a great fan of the band since then, but mainly for their earlier period. But I never kept on playing Duke quite often, and not only for emotional reasons. Half of the time of the album is occupied by 2 superb musical sequences: Behind The Lines - Duchess - Guide Vocal, and Duke's Travels - Duke's End; the first would no doubt be present in my \\"best-of\\" of Genesis; lots of changes of tempo by the one and only Tony Banks, very fine lyrics and a great drum-work from start to finish by Phil Collins will certainly satisfy many progressive fans of the band. But there's more good stuff: Turn It On Again is one of my favourite \\"singles\\" of the band and still sounds very fresh these days. As for Misunderstanding or Alone Tonight, they are highly recommended for those who prefer the 80 and 90's sounding of the band. In resume, I regard Duke as a very good album, sometimes a little bit forgotten on the Genesis' catalogue but well capable to catch any type of fan from the band.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|...P>A few years ago one of Britain's veteran movie critics quit the job for good. It wasn't - he said - that he needed to retire, but he felt that with most of the big movies from Hollywood that year being either based on comic books, or being sequels, or being utterly adolescent, it seemed that Hollywood just was not interested in making movies for people like him.<br />He should have waited. If he had seen \\"Lost in Translation\\" he would have realized that someone at least is still interested in making mature intelligent movies for mature intelligent people (no matter how much it infuriates others). In fact some have been doing so for a long time, but they've been doing so in Europe (and even Korea) rather than the United States.<br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" has been compared to David Lean's film of Noel Coward's \\"Brief Encounter\\" more than a few times, and it's a good comparison. If you are a knowledgeable enough movie-goer to know what that film is, and to like it, there is a good chance you will like this one, even though it modernises the whole issue. I sincerely doubt that most of those marking this movie down either know or truly appreciate more thoughtful cinema like David Lean's early romance.<br />Like \\"Brief Encounter\\" \\"Lost in Translation\\" is about two people in indifferent marriages who meet, and who form a bond. Unlike \\"Brief Encounter\\" we're not immediately sure that it is a romantic bond. Also unlike \\"Brief Encounter\\" both characters are jet-lagged and generally not quite sure of the direction of their lives. There is an age difference. And it takes place in a land that is strange to both people.<br />One of the great advantages of that is that the marriages are shown more obliquely, often by telephone calls or fax messages, and we're left to focus on the main characters Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob (Bill Murray). <br />Scarlett Johansson gives a subtle and mature performance as Charlotte. She's been around in movies since 1994, and was terrific when the role allowed, in \\"The Horse Whisperer\\", \\"Ghost World\\", \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\", and - more recently in \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". She is excellent here as a young woman who is discovering that her husband is a rather more shallow (and fame blinded) individual that she once thought. Witness the scene where he criticises her for pointing out that Evelyn Waugh was a man. <br />Bill Murray as the aging actor Bob, in Tokyo for a Suntory TV ad and photo shoot, gives one of his best performances ever. I can't say it surprises me as much as it surprised some. He already showed his ability to go further than mindless comedy in several movies, including \\"Tootsie\\", \\"The Razor's Edge\\", \\"Groundhog Day\\", \\"Mad Dog and Glory\\" , \\"Ed Wood\\", \\"Rushmore\\" and \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\". I have long loved him even in his more comedic roles, such as \\"Scrooged\\" too, and he was the ONLY thing that made \\"Ghostbusters\\" worth sitting through. Expect to see him here in the more serious of those roles.<br />So these two meet. And they begin to warm to one another against the backdrop of a country whose rules and customs and language are strange to them. And, both facing crises, they find in one another some hope, some indication of how to come to terms with or change their lives. They also have to face the question of what they can mean to one another, and the movie resolves that in a particularly grown-up way that seems to annoy the heck out of some viewers.<br />Sofia Coppola has made a very different film here from \\"The Virgin Suicides\\". Her script is perhaps a little slight, but that works well for the material. If you have much intelligence many things do not need to be put into words. In fact, that's the hallmark of a film that works, as film, rather than as visualised writing. And she's magnificently aided and abetted, who - if the DVD is to be believed - achieved spectacularly beautiful results in a very short filming time. It looks almost unlit, but it IS lit subtly. <br />I guess that stands for the whole movie. It looks like a slice of life, but it is pointed up, subtly. For those with the ability to recognise this, and the emotional maturity to identify with, or understand the characters, it is well worth every single ounce of the praise it has been receiving.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The songs in this CD are very upbeat and enjoyable.  They're mostly dance song -- with the vibes and beats.  If one likes to sing and dance to the song happily, the songs in the CD will do it.  Songs such as &quot;Me against the music,&quot; &quot;Outrageous,&quot; and &quot;The Hook Up&quot; are definitely upbeat, with Britney urging the listeners to party and have fun.   &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; will give vibes with her constant moaning all over the song.  However, songs such as &quot;Touch of My Hand,&quot; and &quot;The Shadow&quot; will hint her emotional feelings -- a little sad but lovely.  The songs -- overall -- are good and enjoyable.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Nirvana, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin--what common thread do these bands share?  They dared to take the music community by the skin and pull it inside-out.  That's exactly what Mars Volta is providing for a new generation of music lovers who feel like they're drowining in the current sea of substanceless nu-metal and pre-fabricated pop crap.  Volta see music as it is meant to be--as art.  They are forcing rock to progress, to move out of its current senility and to be provacative once again.  In order for new things to happen, experiments must be made, and Mars Volta certainly do that with both force and soulful passion.
0385504209|3.0|If you find a book fascinating in the beginning and riveting in the middle but disappointing in its ending, is it a good book or a not-so-good book?  I dunno, but like most people who have read \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" I couldn't put the book down. Until the last part of the book that is, when I couldn't put it down because I couldn't pick it up.<br />The hills are alive with the sound of people plunking money down for this book.  Inspired by this, I, too, plunked.  While I found the prose in \\"The DaVinci Code\\" hardly Emersonian and the characters cardboard cut-outs, throughout most of the book you HAVE to know what is going to happen next.  Sometimes, unfortunately, I knew what was going to happen next before it happened because I had figured out the often rather puerile cryptic clues before the combined talents of the lead characters, who happen to be the world's greatest symbologist and one of France's best cryptologists.  So much for character credibility.<br />What bothered me most about this book was that although there was a cursory \\"Fact\\" page at the beginning stating a few items of non-fiction upon which the book is based, I couldn't differentiate what was fact, factoid, and fantasy, apart from what was obviously fiction.  I thought Dan Brown could have added an author's afterword at the end to help the reader in this regard.  I suppose I could read \\"De-Coding Da Vinci: The Facts Behind the Fiction of the Da Vinci Code\\" when it's released.  But having put \\"The DaVinci Code\\" down a final time, I don't think I care anymore.<br />\\"The DaVinci Code\\" is definitely a page-turner.  You are driven to climb peak after peak of suspense.  But the final descent is into a valley of disappointment.
B00006879E|2.0|Here's a band that deserves a little popularity because they're kinda unique, at least compared to what else is on mainstream radio these days. However, anyone who thinks Maroon 5 is innovative or groundbreaking badly needs more knowledge of real music, and/or is quite easily amused. Of course, this album's lead-off single &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; is a killer funk-rock groove that sounds awesome on the radio. The next two tracks on the disc, &quot;This Love&quot; (the new single) and &quot;Shiver&quot; are pretty solid exercises in groovy white soul. But after that strong opening sequence, this album is a joke. Apparently Maroon 5 wants to be a boy band with musical skills, which is weird for a bunch of guys who are clearly far enough into adulthood to longer need teenage girls screaming at them (on the other hand, some guys just never grow up). Standard oh-girl lyrics, bad attempts at soulful vocals, and false R&amp;B music are evident in losers like the vocoder-infested &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;The Sun,&quot; and the sleep-inducing ballad &quot;Secret.&quot; Attempts at rockin' grooves like &quot;Not Coming Home&quot; are the sounds of pretty boys who assume they can rock even when they've probably never even listened to real rock in their lives.<br />Some other reviewers who have noticed how unimpressive Maroon 5 really is, other than that great lead single, have made the comparison to a boy band that has picked up instruments. I couldn't agree more. And if you think this music is original, I will merely direct you to the classic artists that Maroon 5 has ripped off most heavily: Stevie Wonder and his colleagues who successfully melded rock, soul, and funk back in the early- to mid-70s. Maroon 5's singer rips off Stevie's vocal style by way of Justin Timberlake, while the musicians rip off Stevie's strong multi-genre skills by way of Jamiroquai. That makes Maroon 5 at least two generations away from the real music that they think they're capable of. [~doomsdayer520~]le of. [~doomsdayer520~]
0739302043|5.0|To those people out there looking for &quot;Truth&quot; in this work.  All I have to say is...IT'S A NOVEL!  A WORK OF FICTION!!  Yes there are many truisms written in this work and yes there is controversy in this work. But let's not forget. It is NOT a Historical document.  It was written to entertain you!!!!  How many people out there read Tom Clancy Novels think that the stories actually happened?  Probably only the people giving The Da Vinci Code 1 star.  Works of fiction can't be true or false.  They are either entertaining or not.  The Da Vinci Code is a very intriguing novel.  The suspense keeps you turning page after page.  The protagonist and antagonist characters are rock solid and the story is riveting.  I wouldn't be suprised to see this one made into a major motion picture in the next year or two.
0345457684|2.0|Obviously my very strong negative reaction to this novel is in the minority, so before anyone takes my opinion too seriously he/she should take a look at some of the other reviews.   Since I am writing in dissent here, I apologise for my less than pithy comments.  To see where I'm coming from, you might want to read 'Voice of the Whirlwind' (Williams) which is very similar to 'Altered Carbon' and which succeeds where 'Altered Carbon'falls short.  I can review the high points quickly, the thumbnail sketch of the noirish detective story is very good (the overall plot strategy you might say) and the writing on a scene by scene or at the line level frequently sizzles, however at the operational level of plotting and character 'Altered Carbon' mostly failed to work for me.  It doesn't work as good science fiction either, and that's a good place to start.<br />The first person narrator (Kovacs, the 'detective') is supposedly an informed citizen of his future, yet he often lapses into modes of thought which are more appropriate to much more primitive times.  This lapse into anachronistic thought patterns happens either for the sake of expedience or to create bogus 'surprises' for both the reader and the narrator.  There's a good example of the expedient variety where the protagonist goes off onto a pointless killing spree, knowing that he's under close surveillance by the police and one or two other parties without worrying about any sort of precautionary or evasive action.  Maybe Kovacs is just being stupid because the guy doesn't even look over his shoulder, but it also shows that he isn't worrying about futuristic bugs, vastly improved video surveillance syetems etc.  So I guess this exemplifies two shoddy practices, expedient anachronism and stupidity.   Obviously, the author's aware of this fault as there's an attempt to paper over this problem, when it's later revealed that the police lost track of Kovacs, but of course he had no way of knowing that at the time he set off on his rampage.   If devices of this sort are employed sparingly, I'm pretty forgiving, but if I see that the writer uses them knowingly and often, I think he's disrepecitng my intelligence and indulgence.<br /> The problems with character and plot in 'Altered Carbon' are so closely entwined it's hard to treat them separately.  However, the first big problem is that Kovacs is inconsistent, and ironically, another character in the novel obligingly points that out to us, though the inconsistency encompasses more than merely his personality.  He's supposed to be some sort of renegade super-effectvie super-psychopath as the result of special training and conditioning.  However, he seems more like an impotent, gratuitously violent, unpredictabley sentimental thug, maybe someone like Bobby Brown (Whitney's beau).  Everybody in the story, including the viewpoint character, tells us the opposite though.  In the context of all the violence and adulation, the reader expects Kovacs to be a smart tough guy, but looking at what he does, how he does it, and why he does it, there doesn't seem to much support for that belief.   In order to talk about why the protagonist appears to be wonderfully ineffective and how most of the other characters fail to work for me, I'll need to look at the plot.<br />The plot moves largely by employing a hackneyed device from detective stories.  Almost every bit of knowledge or effective action that comes Kovacs' way is either provided by, done by, or massively enabled by the various women that our hero encounters.  Virtually everything he does on his own is either wrong or futile or stupid.  Basically, the women he meets fall over themselves to help him out (to be fair at least one wants to kill him) it's like watching a TV episode of 'Mike Hammer' which equally relied on this cliche, but with tongue firmly in cheek, 'Altered Carbon', alas, has no sense of humor about it's absurdities or awkward bits.  This dependence on others renders Kovacsvery passive and ineffective as a character and makes it hard to beleive what we're told about him or that he qualifies as an amazing and scary guy.  Anyway, in order to believe that all these women (and at least one computer) are willing to go to great lengths, take substantial risks, and go against their own best interests to help Kovacs out, I require either sufficient motivation or plotting that manages to keep me from worrying about what is motivating the characters.  In this case, I worried a lot about motivation and generally found it wanting, though there's one striking and very cool counterexample.<br />I think I'll now close with another coupled defect, an example of noire failure and the eager embrace of a dangerous and very popular plot convention which has been ruining many Science Fiction novels  for years.  A classic noire story is a gestalt allegoy.  It starts with the protagonist working on the basis of bad data, mistaken theories and flawed methods, he/she follows these and tests them against a radically different reality, which leads to an enlightenment and some sort of action and conclusion in harmony with the true state of affairs.  The point of maximum cognitive dissonance generally occurs very close to the climax.  In 'Altered Carbon' this point  occurs about 1/3 of the way through the story, and at that point the first part of the novel has an abortive termination  and then the novel gets started almost from scratch all over again.  For me, the tempo never felt right thereafter.  I've seen this structure work, but most of the authors  I consider superior noire stylists don't even try.  The practice of throwing away a big chunk of a novel and starting all over again is bafflingly common in Science Fiction, and the conventional noire plot easliy lends itself to it, but it's rarely pulled off in either genre or combinations thereof.
0440180295|5.0|This novel reminded me of a bizarre abstract painting.  Vonnegut is perhaps the Picasso of literature.  Billy Pilgrim's bizarre story is told in pieces, jumbled and out of order, but the novel is still put together ingeniously.  Vonnegut brilliantly adds in his touch of science fiction, toying with such matters as time travel and alien abduction, but these are only the backdrop for Billy's real story of sacrifice, tragedy, and the pains of violence and combat.  Billy is a tortured hero, pathetic but still likeable.  His story is a sad one and you feel as if you must like him or else.  The review on the book says it well; it is a book &quot;at which you are not permitted to laugh.&quot;  One of my favorites of all time.

0684833395|5.0|While this book is draining, emotionally, mentally, and even somewhat physically, it certainly deserves is position as one of the ten greatest novels of all time.  This cleverly written work of fiction is filled with masterfully utilized irony, paradox, humor, and suspense.  It is a shocking novel that makes you chuckle, but with regret.  Yossarian is one of the most unforgettable protagonists, the ultimate anti-hero.  In addition, the novel is lush with characters crafted to make you laugh, cry, gasp, or pound your fist in rage.  I once read another review of this novel in which the reviewer said the novel was &quot;frustrating.&quot;  I agree, to an extent.  It is frustrating because Yossarian is constantly trying to get himself out of a horrible situation, but he keeps getting sucked back in and trapped (hence Catch-22).  If you are looking for an easy read, this is not it.  But if you are searching for a fun, hilarious ride of a book, you've made a wise decision.
B000001E8S|2.0|This U2 side project may be innovative and even cutting-edge for some people, but frankly it doesn`t seem like such a strong and challenging record to me. The first songs are interesting, providing some techno-oriented soundscapes with intriguing electronic dance elements. Those certainly create a moody and mildly enticing atmosphere, and Bono`s vocals are dark and mysterious enough for the tunes. However, as the record unfolds, it soon becomes repetitive and tiresome, turning into the hit-and-miss kind of album. This material is fine as hip background music, as it certainly helps to create a cool mood, but it doesn`t stand out as an unique and essential listening experience. It`s a decent effort, yet it never rises above average, mildly pleasant music with a couple of worthwile moments. &quot;Passengers: Original Soundtracks Vol 1&quot;, like &quot;Pop&quot;, is an interesting failure for U2, carrying some good ideas but lacking in development. For a somewhat similar though better effort, stick with &quot;Zooropa&quot;, where experimentation delivered an overall solid result.  <BR>Subpar and uneven.
B000050IL0|4.0|Although I HEARTILY recommend this DVD, I thought I'd give a heads-up pointing out that the soundtrack on this DVD is NOT the exact same one as Gould's CD of his second generation of Goldberg recordings. The digital CD recording was made simultaneously with a video-taping, but for whatever reasons, the soundtrack of the video/DVD is NOT of the same quality of the CD's digital soundtrack -- the CD being quite superior as far as background noise (aside from Gould's humming of course!) and wow and flutter -- both of which are much more noticeable on the video/DVD. In fact, some of the variations are slightly different \\"takes\\" than the CD! I suspected this and it became pretty obvious when I started the CD with the DVD only to find out that by the end of the end of the first Aria things were outta' sync by more than a little!<br />Anyway, if you DO buy this DVD (and again, I DO recommend it!) be sure you don't overlook the superior sound quality of the CD also! -- Roy
0790751089|2.0|Despite the convincing performances of both Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, this movie is too slow, long and repetitive for its own good. The plot is interesting, even if it doesn`t bring nothing new, making for an enticing enough relationship with some subtle moments. Problem is, it also drags in most of the scenes, and the constant overexposure of the lead actors becomes tiresome and unappealing. The settings could be more diverse too, since at times it seemed like I was watching a play and not a film. And although it never reaches corny melodrama, it gets too sappy at parts. Overall, not a bad movie, but not a masterpiece either. Far from a must-see, it still is worth watching once, though.
B000002HMH|2.0|In the past twenty years, there is not one story in the history of music that can be compared to the rise and steady fall of Metallica. In the short span of four years, from 1984 to 1988, the band released three of the most important albums in metal's history. Even today, eighteen years later, Master of Puppets continues to be the template of which metal bands evaluate their albums. It is then not that surprising of why Metallica couldn't make such a great album since; mainly because they had reached perfection. However, that is no excuse to give up their roots for heavy metal.<BR>In 1988, after the death of Cliff Burton, which many fans believe was the main reason the band fell so dramatically, they came out with their last real metal album, \\"...And Justice for All.\\" And then it went to hell.<BR>It was in the year of 1991 that Metallica began to show their steady decline, with the emergence of their self-titled album, commonly known as the Black Album. Those that were around to see Ride the Lightning released were extremely disappointed. The album represented more of Bon Jovi than anything else, as it was striving to reach out to the masses of non-metalheads and mindless, musically impaired, bubble gum teenagers. It was because of this goal that it was their most successful album of their career. <BR>The outcome from there was obvious. The band took that formula that worked for the Black Album and continued to ride it out for as long as they could. Thus, in 1996, we were given Load, and I could see Lars and the gang plummet into the obscurity of popular music.<BR>Those that were around for their earlier releases, when they listened to Load, they couldn't even tell that it was the same band. It was just that different. But difference isn't what killed the cat. In fact, difference is what made the Holy Trinity of Metal Albums so good, and for those who don't know what they are, you don't deserve to know. No, it was lack of integrity that made this album fall on its face. Kirk sounds like he's been crewing sandpaper for the last five years, and Lars, well, I won't even go into that. Let's just say that since \\"Justice\\" he hasn't performed to potential.<BR>The lyrics weren't nearly as thought out or well played as they were in \\"Justice,\\" which most Metallica fans will agree is the best album in that regard. I actually had to look up the lyrics and read them to see what the hell Kirk was saying at first. I never had to do that with any other Metallica album. NEVER. <br />But thank God there was one decent song on this, Until It Sleeps, which is, hands down, the best song `Tallica has ever done since the Black Album. But that still doesn't make up for the rest of the album. <BR>So, in conclusion, why Metallica, why?
B00018D44U|5.0|This CD was a great thing to listen to. You feel like your in your own little world listening to Norah Jones. Her voice is amazing as are her songs. Her style is very unique and comforting. A must have if you have her first CD
B00005QG9J|5.0|After first hearing 'A Crow left of the Murder',I decided to listen to what my friend called &quot;a staple of everyone's music collection&quot;.I was pleasantly surprised by this album,because the style is so subtly emotive on some on the beatiful melodies of 'Aqueous Transmission' and 'Echo'.This effortless lyricality contrasts well with the louder, more energetic tracks like 'Circles' and 'Nice to Know You'.The asian instrumental influence on some of the tracks only adds to the interest and infinite variation of this amazing collection of songs.Each one is individual perfection,except 'Are you in' which for some reason I hate.
B000088E6D|5.0|Saw Michael Buble on Ellen Degeneres today, bought the CD and it's soooooooooooooooooooo good! I also pre-ordered the DVD - it will be sooooooooooooo good to see him again.<BR>He has a cool voice (AND HE'S GORGEOUS TOO!!!!!)<BR>I think it was him singing in the movie Down With Love too.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is my all time, ultimate, bar none favorite movie. This timeless film marries artistic genious with an excemplary story line. The special effects are unbeleivably beleavable and so original it will amaze you.<BR> During the course of this film I cry, every time, at at least 4 spots. Parts are funny and lighthearted. Other spots are dismal and serious. A love story to rival all love stories. This is an emotional ride that you won't forget. <BR>  I've just finally gotten a legal copy because this film can be hard to find for a reasonable price, but whatever you pay it will be worth it.
B00005JN1L|2.0|\\"Secret Window\\" must be the umpteenth movie adapted from a Stephen King story, and it's not one of the most successful. I haven't read all of King's works -- evidently they constitite a small-town library -- but the ones I've read reveal a mild talent for the Gothic genre. (Interestingly, one of the best, \\"Gerald's Game\\", has not been filmed, perhaps because its claustrophobic variations on a theme would not appeal to adolescents.) \\"Secret Window\\" has Johnny Depp as a burned-out author going through an unusually recriminatory divorce. Depp, fresh from playing Captain Queen in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", goes in the opposite direction here: badly in need of strong coffee, hair a rat's nest, tattered bathrobe, thick eyeglasses clamped to his face. Depp takes chances, you gotta give him credit. His character has moved into an upstate New York country house, isolated and in more need of repairs than Depp himself. He's immediately confronted by a strange character out of \\"Deliverance\\" (John Turturro) accusing the author of plagiarism. Now, in real life, with today's high-tech communications, such a vague accusation could be resolved in hours. But this is not real life, it's Stephen King, so the situation drags on and on, becoming increasingly nasty. Director David Koepp works with the idea that if you're manipulative enough the audience will not notice the incompetence in the plot's construction. And the manipulation is shameless, not to mention predictable. Scene after sloppy scene is just too obvious to be scary. As for the ending: well, I'm not going to give away the secret of \\"Secret Window\\". Let's just say that Margaret Millar did it a lot better in \\"Beast in View\\", and that was nearly 50 years ago.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Last album I thought was just a one shot deal with Neil Kernon but lo and behold another spawn was awaiting me. This is even better than gore obsessed, live cannibalism and anything else they have done with Corpsegrinder or Chris Barnes. This is absolutely the best death metal album I have ever heard. Every song is a winner on this disc, including the dvd which is a great introspection into the men who make up this band. The premier track though is Nothing Left To Mutilate whose beat thanks to Paul has been caught in my head since the album was released. I want to give kudos to everyone in this band for all that they have done to keep this type of music alive and for Corpsegrinder who is making his lyrics so discernible that I don't need the lyrics anymore.

0140177396|4.0|The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along. They travel together working on a ranch.  Their goal is to earn enough moeny to live out their dream.  It shows how no matter what happens they have a friendship which connects them in some way. They have a wonderful frienship and stand by each other.  Lennie is not the brightest man and can be a little aggrivating but no matter what George is there to help and protect him. This book is a great book that shows how very different personalities can get along.  I fully recommend this book by John Steinbeck.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie has the correct title.  I tried to watched this movie for 45 minutes and just couldn't take any more.  With all the good reviews and nominations/awards that it received, was I the one that was \\"Lost in Translation\\"?

0446530891|3.0|The love triangle is the most interesting part of this book.  The rest of the book has so many twists and turns that I wonder if trying to surprise the reader was the main purpose of the book instead of telling a great story.  You will definitely read the entire book once you start, but may be disappointed when it is over.  This is my least favorite book by David Baldacci, my favorite being The Simple Truth.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bach or Mozart? <br />Proust or Tolstoy?<br />When a work of art managed to do what it sets out to do, when it means so much to some of its readers/listeners/viewers it clearly functions well as a piece of art. Clearly its creator is in control of his or her material.<br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is not perhaps in the league of the artists I mention. But then how many movies are? But above and beyond the artist's ability, and Coppola's is prodigious, it becomes a matter of which means more to me? Michelangelo or Leonardo? Proust or Tolstoy? Those who truly love art for art's sake can appreciate them all, even while being more moved by one than another. But a lot of people are going to tell you the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; sucks because they'd rather have a nude painted on black velvet.<br />At this level of creation, it's not about how good or bad the work is. It's clearly a terrific work. It's just about taste. <br />If you have any idea that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; might be to your taste - and many of the five star reviews here (very very few of the one star ones) are detailed enough to let you ascertain this - then you really owe it to yourself to try it. I think it is a stunning and beautiful movie, and recommend it completely to anyone with the soul for it.
B000088E6D|5.0|Thank you Ellan! I've heard of Michael Buble', and on Ellen yesterday, lo and behold I hear this young singer singing COME FLY WITH ME like he owned it. Fantastic rendition. Fantastic smooth style and fantastic results on this cd. This cd will be a mainstay in my 'play all day' collection. Thank you Ellan - I've found what I've been looking for.....................thank you.........
B0000025P9|5.0|Forget the negative comments here, this album is well worth having.  It is a great album, but Toto has many albums up there with it, if not better than, this one.  Toto has so many good albums, it's hard to pick their best.  Check 'em all out.  Just skip Past to Present with it's record label pressured 4 new tracks sung by the record label picked outsider Jean-Michel Byron.<br />Correction to to the review here \\"An album about Steve & Rosanna...\\" written on August 29, 2002 by reviewer 'rcg2'.  Rosanna was written about Steve Porcaro's girlfriend Rosanna Arquette, not Steve Lukather's.
B000000OQF|5.0|Just a little correction to George's review. This album doesn't sell 5,000 copies a month......it sells 9,000 copies a week.<BR>Btw great album. You don't have to skip tracks. Perfect for a Rock N' Roll fan.
B000002572|5.0|To put it simply: The world was doomed to a life of disco. Rock was dying. This album came out. Set record for highest selling debut album. Saved world from disco. True Rock will never die!!<BR>The tune of this album is upbeat and just about every song is still playing on the radio. Everyone, even those who don't listen to rock, will love this. Don't get me wrong however, thinking that im saying that there is no hardcore riffs. If you like your rock nice and loud then just put on Foreplay/Long Time. Unfortunately however, just about every other album boston produced was lame. The only reason Boston's Greatest hits was good was because just about all of it was this album!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I can't believe this movie was up for a nomination.  Hard to follow and was extremely boring.  Not good enough for a made for TV movie.  Has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. Don't waste your time or money.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|yes, the sound of it is exactly like the first cd. but whats wrong with that? the first cd was awesome, and so is this one. not only is their music darn good, but the lyrics on this cd are equally cool with songs that have titles such as &quot;meet me in the bathroom&quot; (guess what thats about?). ok, here are your instructions: buy this cd, accept that the strokes are probably a lot cooler than you are &amp; that their music rocks, and enjoy it, damnit!
B00005JMCT|1.0|this is another teen party movie where the producers feel they need to make an unrated version for each american pie, road trip type of movie they make. its ridiculous.<BR>too bad the stars of this series(except Eugene Levy) have sold themselves out. any other movie they star in that offers anything less than the mindless pathetic repeated sex jokes they do, noone would see it.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Hey I don't know why some people are complaining over this album. This album is by no means a &quot;Best Of&quot; album. This is a Greatest Hits album which means the tracks included are their best selling singles. This is what casual people demand,not hardcore fans. For the casual listener this is the PERFECT album to get. It has all the radio popular songs GN'R has ever produced. Obviously this compilation is great because as some of you may not know this has beenone of the world's best selling new releases. In the US this CD is beating out acts like N.E.R.D and Evanescence. In the UK it's #2 and in the US it was written that it would be #4. Here is a list of how well the album is doing around the world:<br />Ireland: # 1 (for the second straight week now!!!)<br />Iceland: # 1<br />Austria: # 1 <br />Norway: # 1<br />UK: # 2 <br />New Zealand: # 2<br />Switzerland: # 3 <br />Sweden: # 3<br />Germany: # 4 <br />Argentina: # 4<br />Finland: # 6<br />Denmark: # 12<br />Spain: # 14 <br />Netherlands: # 17 <br />Belgium: # 45 <br />Rock on Gunner.
B000089RVX|5.0|My first impression of this band was linkin park with a chick. Now almost a year later I see a vary promising young band with an amazing vocalist. heavy guitars with intricit acustics and amy lees amzing voice make this record a must have for any rock fan. And now that Terry from cold is on board I see nothing but a promising future for evanescence.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is The BEST! Damn! My first time listening to Marilyn Manson and I LOVE IT! (...)<BR>My thoughts for the tracks are!<br />1. Irresponsible Hate Anthem: A Very good opening song! Heavy and very Dark and creepy. (9.5/10)<br />2. Beautiful People: The Song every Manson fan love! The best song (Lyrically) nice vocals! (10/10)<br />3. Dried up, Tied and Dead to the World: sounded like that the drummer just killed the drum set by the way he is beating it! (10/10)<br />4. Tourniquet: Rock and Goth song! Very good song! (9/10)<br />5. Little Horn: A complete death metal song. (10/10)<br />6. Cryptorchild: A gothic and Death Metal song! Very hard feelings in this one! (10/10)<br />7. Deformography: Very good guitars. Hate the Lyrics! (8/10)<br />8. Wormboy: Slow one! dont really like it. (6/10)<BR>9. Mister Superstar: This songs is HOT! Love the guitars! (10/10)<br />10. Angel With the Scabbed Wings: Another let down in the album! (5/10)<br />11. Kinderfeld: Heavy but awful! Just pure garbage! (1/10)<br />12. Antichrist Superstar: There you go, after all the let downs the band made it up for the fans! Very very very heavy song! 10/10<br />13. 1996: Anti everything! The whole song is MM screaming on top of his lungs! (10/10)<br />14. Minute of Decay: Slow but cool! (9/10)<br />15. Reflecting God: That's it! MM is my favourite band after this song! It's slow! It's Heavy! the best song ever in the metal history! (10000/10)<br />16. Man That You Fear: Another GREAT song! Very slow but shows that Even the guy every parent think about is that HE IS DEVIL have got some feelings and also had f**ked up life! 10/10<br />17. Untitled (Hidden Track): Didn't listen to it yet!<br />So, what do you think? Overall this album was great! You definitely want to buy this one if you are a fan of Goth/Metal music!!!!!!
B00000IP3S|5.0|Actually I have to give this more of a 4 because it's not as good as Nightfall In Middle Earth. Still, despite their ... music, you should really listen to their lyrics. Like NIME is about The Silmarillion by JRR Tolkien, IFTOS is about the Sword and the Stone. Rather than re-telling the story, they pick out the emotional aspects which appeal to them. My favourites are track 3 & 7. 3 is very 'folk' but it's so well done that not many people care (unless they're hard core metal fans). 7 is a mutual track which everyone likes regardless of whether they like the 'heavier' stuff or 'softer' stuff.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen and I've seen alot! Simply what storytelling is about making you question everything and keeps you pondering the whole time! Wonderful, I'm amazed this movie was produced via hollywood, compared to some of the crap they put out wow!
B00008WG3U|2.0|9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq were great to these guys, as it seems they'd completely run out of ideas. The political shtick is simplistic, half hearted and boring and the 'funny' songs are excruciatingly 'un'-funny by this point.  Time to hang up the hat, guys. Their output is top-notch from &quot;Ribbed&quot; through &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;, however. &quot;Political&quot; punk is rarely any good as the music usually takes a back seat to merchandise sales and bland rhetoric and this is no exception. Stick to their earlier stuff.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this album. Shur the songs are great but this record is geffens way of milking just a littel more mony out of what was once a good thing. The band members had no say whitch song would go on here and dident get to write any liner notes or nothing. So I'm gonna keep this short and sweet and just tell you not to support this project. Not becouse the music is bad,acctualy these songs are all amazing, but becouse it was relased without the bands concent.Anyways I really want this to blow up in david geffens face, so DO NOT support it!!!!!!!!
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I honestly used to like Godsmack but as i got older my music taste matured and I found out how great &quot;Grunge&quot; is (the best kind of rock music) I ventured upon Alice In Chains cd &quot;Dirt&quot; I was blown away by how good this cd is. Quickly I realized how bad Godsmack rips AIC off. To the point where it makes me sick. I mean I have nothing against being influenced by a band but to copy their sound exactly is stealing is should be a crime. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AND DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND!!!!!! The name Godsmack even comes from a AIC chains song called &quot;God Smack&quot;. It really cant get any worse than this, or can it? It can! I heard Godsmack is now coming out with an aucustic EP. Alice In Chains Had two Aucustic EP's one called &quot;Sap&quot; and the other one called &quot;Jar Of Flies&quot;. Dont buy this cd buy AIC cd &quot;Dirt&quot; or &quot;Facelift&quot; They are way better than any Godsmack record. Don't support a band with no original sound or talent!

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The albumn starts off with American Idol's Kelly Clarkson and her hit single, &quot;The Trouble with Love is&quot;  The song is very beautiful and captivating.  Maroon 5 is an awesome band and I'm so glad to see their song &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; in the soundtrack.  &quot;Here with Me&quot; is a beautiful classic by Dido.  A very soothing song that is very relaxing.  The talented Norah Jones features her song, &quot;Turn Me On&quot;  She's truly talented and a great songwriter.  &quot;Wherever you will Go&quot; by the Calling is a fantastic love song and will always be one of my favorites.  Not only does the albumn have slower love songs, it includes an &quot;Oldies&quot; hit that is great to JUMP to, &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot;  The soundtrack includes a song by the Beach Boys and other awesome songs.  Run to get this soundtrack today!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Let's see, dude's taking umpteen years to release an album that may never come out, so what's a record company to do?<BR>Yeah, I'm one of those casual fans. I've heard all these songs on the radio, and now I have them all in one place... finally!<BR>It IS skimpy on info; lyrics or an essay woulda been nice. But at least the comp. producer assembled it in chronological order (to chart the decline and fall, I guess).<BR>And you know what? After listening to this comp. it makes me want to go out and buy 'Appetite for Destruction'. So there! Plus, there's nothing I like better than making rock stars mad. I should have bought TWO copies!
B00008ADPF|1.0|which is why I am not going to bash you for listening to this type of music. It is not your fault that you have been exposed to this sort of money influenced rock, but rather the corporations that put out this type of music. Corporations that turn making music into a business. These corporations coax artists that are very talented, like Nickleback, to put out music that has one objective, making money. In doing so, they sacrifice making any original or creative music. So here are a few suggestions to help get you Nickleback fans on the road to good music. <br />Blonde Redhead ~ Misery is a Butterfly,   Wrens ~ The Meadowlands,   Broken Social Scene ~ You Forgot It in People,  The Unicorns ~ Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone,   Sigur Ros ~ ( ),   Sufjan Stevens ~ Greetings From Michigan: The Great Lakes State,   Mum ~ And Finally We Are No One,   Franz Ferdinand ~ Franz Ferdinand <br />Enjoy!

B000060P79|4.0|Simple Plan won't ever be punk or rock or whatever else you want to classify it as being.  Simple Plan is a pop group with catching beats of songs that are written to phase younger kids.  A lot of the songs can relate to what preteenagers are feeling, but not necassarily pointed to older teenagers and beyond. <br />I thought some of the songs were catchy, but they soon got old.  I think my two favorite songs would have to be &quot;Meet you There&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;, and &quot;My Alien&quot;  I must admit a lot of the songs are stupid such as &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;God Must Hate me&quot;  <br />I'm not a hater, but not a strong liker.  Maybe four stars was being extremely nice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Had the series been allowed to have a normal lifetime, as in Babylon 5 and the previous Star Trek series, but unfortunately<BR>it got &quot;stuck&quot; on the Fox network.<BR>Maybe in the future the SciFi channel may pick it up, now that Scifi<BR>is maturing with more top notch scifi series, or maybe WB.<BR>The Fox Network however does not have any panache in its programing mores the pity.<BR>Its not that they cant afford it, it must lie somewhere in the lack luster progamming dept.<BR>I saw very little of The Firefly as Fox so typically yanked it out, but I was impressed with the markmenship of the production team. Thumbs up to the Firefly and DOWN to Fox,<BR>Thanks
B0000027D5|5.0|I recently bought this item a few weeks ago, ad after the first listen through, my impression of the album was nothing less than, &quot;Wow. Truly exellent. This is the Mona Lisa masterpeice of guitar music.&quot; It manages to showcase some of Santana's early work, the latin-pop-rock-blues, as well as including the Santana band's later, more Jazz and spiritually infused music. It also includes the 16 minute masterpeice &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot;, my favorite song of all time.<BR>BUY IT, FEEL IT, DIG IT, BABY!
B0001ADAVK|1.0|This movie is beautiful, and well-acted. However, the premise is pure crap, and the characters are ridiculous parodies. The really offensive thing is that it's basically an attack on an entire ethnic group -- white, anglo-saxon protestant women. If something like this was made about any minority group -- let's say, Jews -- there would be people with pitchforks marching on the offices of the studio. However, here, WASPs are portrayed as rigid, unfeeling, cruel, shallow, simpleminded and vaguely fascistic. Every single one of them, and at one of the top schools in the country. I doubt very much if Wellesley in the fifties was populated by women as dumb and awful as this, and the effort to portray them that way is more than a little offensive.
6305508550|5.0|Looks like someone's got a case of the Mondays.  Work Sucks.  Mike Judge knows this and he uses this knowledge to write a great satire about the Gen-X corporate world.  Ron Livingston is great as Peter Gibbons.  I think everyone wishes they could rebel against their superiors like he does without consequence.  Milton is a hilarious character with his constant mumbling and you do start to feel bad for him.  Peter's job is to update the computer software for the Y2K switch.  That's funny because now we have an even better feel to how meaningless is job actually was.  This is one of those movies that I can watch everytime its on TV, no matter where I catch it from.  Definitely one of my all-time favorite comedies and should atleast be viewed by anyone who loves a good comedy.
0060989157|4.0|While I must admit this is a real page-turner, be prepared for some major shocking stories.  I never imagined that this stuff actually happened, and for awhile I thought this was all just b.s. It took so long to sink in. I don't want to imagine the number of girls involved with this band-I think that is so disgusting and nasty.  These guys didn't have a care in the world.  Also the drug use-I can't believe it was that bad.  I mean nothing was held back.  I agree with some other reviewers-Mick seems to be the only one with some real sense here.  Get ready:  this is some really raw stuff.

B00000JCOV|4.0|I am giving Slipknot S/T a 4 star because of originality, no, not just for the masks. Slipknot makes some darn good music, it's fast and very err.. um, loud? The lyrics are very aggressive and the drumming.. Joey tears the place up! The songs are good, most of them at least.. I'll say it like this, if you like metal you should own this album. Listen to it, you'll probably like but don't waste your $$$ on Iowa, which is terrible. The downside the slipknot is that for having 9 people the music isn't exactly technical. Here's how slipknot is...<BR>Drums everywhere, Drums everywhere, noise, noise, noise.. quick crapy guitar solo.. for having 9 people it's a wonder they can play on the same beat all the time. so you've got to give them some credit for that but.. for having 9 people the music should be better. you want a good 9 piece band? Mushroomhead, see, they all play instruments..(ok they're only 8 people, yah, big difference.)
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Not excellent perhaps, but at least very very good. Far from finding it slow I wanted it to go on for at least another half hour. Who wants to walk away from people you have come to care for so much?
0451169514|1.0|I don't know if everyone who read this book are just easily frightened or simple minded, or what, but this is the LEAST scarriest book I have ever read! This book is so long! That in and of itself is not so bad, but there's no reason for it being long! The author drags and drags and drags the story out into a whopping 1100+ page book when it could have all been settled in about 600 pages. <BR>The two stars are for the good start it got. The characters were very interesting, and the nastolgic flashbacks to the 50's when they were kids were pretty good, but that stupid clown got in the way. <BR>At the beginning of the book, it builds a creepy atmosphere as they all talk about this ghost from their past that terrified them. But then when IT starts to show up when they all come back to Derry, and when they all meet back up together, it's retarded. The clown is not scary, and neither are any of the things he turns into. I was rolling my eyes on some parts of the book, actually getting mad at the author for trying to get cheep scares out of me. There's actually a part in the book where one of the characters is in a library, and then IT is standing there on the stairs in the form of a vampire. There's another part where he turns into The Creature From the Black Lagoon and comes after them. The book reads like a 50's horror movie. There's a part i couldn't beleive what i was reading, when one of the characters turned on the radio and he could hear IT saying, &quot;Yep! it's all dead radio! we play all dead all the time!&quot; or something of that matter.<BR>I was just mad that the book was this long, this UNscary, and had this crappy of an ending for me to spend that much time on it. Those characters should have been reserved for a better storyline.<BR>I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
0064471837|4.0|I really loved this book, and think that sabriel and touchstone are both really strong charecters, but this book's only downfall is the lack of explaination. i read at a high high school level, and found it confusing. Nix doesn't explain what the magical elements of the book are, like free magic. i spent half the book thinking 'what the heck is free magic?' but over all, it's a really good book, and i loved it all.
0792833236|5.0|A stirring, gripping tale of a fighter's tumultuous life and times in and out of the ring.  Robert De Niro gives an astounding performance as Jake Lamotta,  the rampaging wild man who storms his way to the title and over damn near anything and everyone else.  His gaining of 70 pounds to show how Lamotta appeared after he left the ring is without question the most devotion to a character in cinematic history.  Deniro won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actor for this one,  and is hailed by fans and critics alike as his finest performance ever.<br />Scorcese of course derves special mention as Director....brilliant cinematography, lighting, terrific.  Also,  Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty were nominated for Academy Awards for thier gripping performances.  Unfortunately they didnt win but thier performances are stunning as well.<br />Truly one of the greatest movies of all time,  it will stay with you long after youve watched it.
B000006NPY|5.0|Well, it is a diffrent album from Billy and co. It wasn`t as comercialy sucefull as the others were, but it represents the Pumpkins at there artistic peek. On no other Pumpkin album you cant find the incredible songs like To Sheila, For Martha or Blank Page. Critics said that the album isnt hard enough, but clearly songs like tha amazing Ava Adore, Pug, Shame and Behold! The Nightmare have got enough dark rock sound to please every rock fan. Perfect is a great dreamy pop song, and a big radio hit. The art cover is a very dark and beautiful.This piece is for any one who sits in a dark room and has got a lot of pain and anger inside. The music on the album is so beautiful, that it makes me very angry, that critics toor the album apart, and now 6 years have past, and they finaly admited that the album was clearly under-rated. So to finnish of..., with this briliant masterpiece Pumpkins didnt make the history books, but it is still by my opinion there best album...
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Seeing as I was introduced to Guns 'N Roses way after their last studio album, I was anticipating a Greatest Hits album and was open to any selections that would (or would have) been included. I heard all the obvious singles (Welcome..., Sweet Child..., etc) and I must say I was extremely shocked to notice a huge gap with the omission of 'Estranged.' Good job, Geffen. WAY off of target there.
185984054X|1.0|Christopher Hitchens finally bought his one-way ticket to Hell with this one!  Anyone that thinks this book is &quot;fair and balanced&quot; should read one that balances this bunk, and then make an informed judgment.  For instance, read Susan Conroy's wonderful &quot;Mother Teresa's Lessons of Love and Secrets of Sanctity.&quot;
B00005JMNA|5.0|this movie was amazing. me and my friend had been diyng to see it since we saw the trailer. though it was a chick-flick, the movie was fun and enjoyable with a hot guy or two (which a movie should ALWAYS be and have). the soundtrack was very good to, i bought it right after we saw the movie. very good movie i sugjest you see it right away!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I originally saw Wicked in San Francisco when it was pre-broadway and fell in love with it.  Hearing Idina Menzel sing Defying Gravity gave me goosebumps.  I was extremely excited when the soundtrack was finally released on CD and bought it immediately.  Every song reminds me of the play and just listening to it brings back that same feeling I had when I saw it.  I was lucky enough to see the play again in New York a couple of weeks ago and if I lived closer I would see it again.  I think it has taken over the number one slot on my all time favorite plays (Phantom moves to number two).  I listen to the CD so much that I hope that I don't wear it out.  While in New York I was lucky enough to find Idina Menzel's two CD's (Here &amp; Still I Can't Be Still)and bought them.  She has the most amazing voice.  See this play!  Buy the soundtrack!  You won't be sorry!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Fantastic flick. Saw it three times back to back on a flight to Europe. Great to see it again on video. Murray rules. The guy next to me on the trip turned it off to play video games. Not surprised. It's not for the video game mentality. Read somewhere that the average length of shot in a mainstream movie these days was about 2- 3 seconds. In &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; they're longer. Our characters reflect. We have time to see em do so. Obviously that tells on the attention spans of some people. Saw someone describe a thirty second title shot of Johansson's bottom - and who'd complain - as lasting 15 minutes. And the much vaunted long window shots take less than a minute IN TOTAL. If you have time for any kind of emotional sense at all you can take that. Maybe it's worth considering what you're looking at, or what people are thinking, rather than wanting to rush to the next car crash or explosion. Funny to see the guy before me saying that the movie was &quot;lost in translation&quot; (ha ha ha). He's not the first to coin that gem even in these reviews, but what does it mean? What it means is someone actually said something meaningful and you didn't understand it out of your own limitations (i.e. not understanding the language). That's not something to boast about.
0060958324|5.0|... and, maybe, will never end.<br />This book caught me in this time of my life when I was &quot;trapped in a crossroads&quot;: Too many options, too few means to take the right decision. I was searching for my own ultimate, ideal, perfect &quot;quality&quot;; the perfect road, the perfect direction. Gradually I started to feel more and more trapped, spending all of my time thinking about the &quot;ideal solution&quot; so that no time was left to actually IMPLEMENT it.<br />This is a whole deal of frustration. And then, a good friend of mine told me &quot;you know what? You remind me very much of Phaedrus&quot;. I went &quot;Who?&quot;, and this is how I got to know the book that is arguably the best book I have ever read.<br />I was amazed with each and every page in that book. Phaedrus' life-story, as described on these long, thoughtful chapters of wisdom, reminded me very much of myself. Same debates; same doubts; same choices; same fears. Same everything.<br />So is there a perfect truth? Absolute truth? Utopia? &quot;The Perfect Quality&quot;? The perfect road? The perfect path of life?<br />Before I read that book, I had a hunch that I know the answer. After I've read it, I realized that I was right. And that feeling was amazing; grab this book, read it, and I bet you'll feel the same way.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I'd just like to say that the reviewer who said most of O'Brian's books were about battles between America and Nelson's Navy is about as wrong as one can be, although it is true that the confrontation in \\"Far Side of the World\\" is about this. <br />Unlike that reviewer perhaps I HAVE actually read the series, and most battles are against the French, with occasional excursions, as in \\"The Ionian Mission\\" against the Turks (after a long blockade of the French incidentally).<br />At first I was annoyed that they had changed the foe in this one from US to France, but then I realised that in some ways this book is an adaptation of elements of the entire series rather than one book. The skull operation occurs in one book, the doctor operating on himself in another, and so on. Whoever adapted this script clearly HAS read all 20 books.<br />Marvellous fim, and in its apparent nonlinear plot, every like O'Brien's books. Few long-time fans of the series will be disappointed, althouigh they may have some quibbles with the castng and be a little upset that the redoubtable Diana did not appear (but then who would have played her?).
B00005B5L4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums and when I saw that it was released on DVD-A, I jumped on it! First of, let's me just say that the audio quality is amazing. The CD version's quality has always abyssmal at best. One big bonus is that it restores Stevie Nicks beautiful and hunting &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, which was cut due to time limitations of lp's. It also restores some of the instrumentations on &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot; (not so sure it works). The best thing about this DVD-A is that you really get to hear every instruments, which are perfectly (and surprisingly) placed in the surround fields. And there is a &quot;making of&quot; track for each song in which all members of the band comment on the songs. A great album made better!
B00006879E|3.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;This Love&quot;. It is a good song and I had heard &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; before and I thought that was a pretty good song also. So I decided to buy the CD. Don't make the same mistake I did (buying the CD). There is only like 3 good songs on the whole cd, all of songs other than This Love, Harder to Breath, and Not Coming Home are just love songs and nothing is uptempo its all depressing and low key. Go to [...] and go to the flash site and listen to the songs on the player, see what I mean.
076780421X|5.0|I thought this was such a cute movie!  It shows that sometimes opposites do attract!  During one seen, Salma talks to Matthew about their differences and the prejudices that both families have with each other while telling a story.  This is something that every body will love, including guys!!
B000002HPV|1.0|This artist is really INSANE! If some so-called artists called this music &quot;art&quot; they're really wrong and crazy. I've been listening Bjork's music a lot of times and I couldn't find an answer to his physically disordered mind. This album gives you a clear idea of how A DISORDERED MIND can produce music.<BR>Do not listen this music unless you have no sense of art and human spirit. This is not what european people listen everyday. Don't be fooled by the idea this is art-music. Go somewhere else, like Beethoven or Vivaldi music. Take this CD to trash!
1577311760|5.0|To those who are searching,<BR>        &quot;You are here to enable the devine purpose of the universe to unfold that is how important you are&quot; these words never meant so much to me until I read this book.We must remember that everyone is at a differant point in their journey. After reading the various reviews, it is appadrent that there are many who are not ready for what Eckhart is bringing forth. If the NOW does not speak to you, then lay it aside and try it again in a year. I have read hundreds of spiritual books from the Kabbala to a course in miracles. I have now read the power of now 7 times, and listened to it 4 times on audio. His aproach has helped me to understand other teachings. Whenever I am at odds with the world I listen to his audio and find my center. Each time I find somthing that my Ego would not accept before. I beleive he is very specific in the techniqes to quiet the mind. The &quot;mind has become the master when it was meant to be the tool&quot; To stop the endless chatter of the mind is Eckharts teaching. He even states that this is the purpose of meditation.Would you not like to have your entire day be a meditation filled with peace. His technique and message are there if we listen with our being, not our mind. We live in eternity; The past and future emotions, and thoughts overshadow this precious gift - the now. Read the other books but make this a must for your bookshelf. At some point in &quot;time&quot; you will find what every one is looking for. I personly have more peace in my life by practicing the power of now. As Eckhart says &quot;try it and you be the proof&quot;
B000005IU1|5.0|Remember the Sex Pistols debut, Nevermind The Bullocks, Here's The Sex Pistols? Well, this onecould be called Never Mind The Ramones Here's The Stooges! This album is the first real punk record. It takes the rough guitars of proto-punks like The Troggs and makes them harder. Simple melodies, great guitar, it's what defines rock. Ron Asheton is the best guitarist ever (okay, maybe Hendrix beats him a  LITTLE)<br />\\"1969\\" opens the album with a look at the year. Then it crashes into a hard and strong guitar solo! <BR>\\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" screams with angry distorted guitar and Iggy sounds pretty riled up! More great guitar at the closing.<BR>\\"We Will Fall\\" is the only song here nobody seems to like. Actually, I think is a good song. it's eerie and mencacing. Iggy sets the perfect pace. The fiddle at the end may seem just a tad to artsy and refined for a hard rock group, but it too has an eerie feel (supposedly the producer wanted them to do a Velvet Underground type number since he had once worked with them).<BR>\\"No Fun\\" has a....well, fun tune! Catchy little rocker.<BR>\\"Real Cool Time\\" starts off with a mechanical sounding guitar and builds weith slow angry tension. Then it bursts with hard guitar fury!<BR>\\"Anne\\" starts off quiet and slow, yet still menacing. Then Iggy sceams \\"I loooove yooooooo!\\" and the fury starts over again.<BR>\\"Not Right\\" is the best song. Fast paced and well sung (even if the lyrics are simple) it features yet ANOTHER guitar solo at the end, in fact one of the best solos ever!<BR>\\"Little Doll\\" closes the album with the lines \\"c'mon shake\\" building it up another slow and angry rock jam! Great way to end it!<BR>Great album, you need to get it. So go get it NOW! This is what rock is all about!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have just received, and watched, the entire run of Firefly on DVD.  I have two things to say:<br />1.  The Fox network executive that hassled, and then cancelled, Firefly, is -- and will always be -- the largest idiot on the face of this planet.<br />2.  Cumulatively, the 14 episodes contained in this DVD set represent the best science fiction storytelling in the last decade.  And I don't even like science fiction!
076790592X|5.0|This book could be about mans eternal quest for the meaning of life. Mitch learns about life by facing death. Morrie teaches Mitch how precious lifes relationships are and how all souls are connected. &quot;Its not the destination thats important, but the journey&quot;. Morrie doesn't say this, he lives it. Anyone who feels a &quot;real man&quot; doesn't cry needs to read this book and learn who we really are and what mankind is really seeking. I recommend this book to everybody.
0312263120|3.0|The pace is fast and the plot has an interesting turn or two, but Brown gives those twists away too soon.  Also, Brown has a way of having things suddenly occur out of the blue, such as the red duffle bag mysteriously flying through the air to incapacitate the bad guy.  If you can get through these bits of &quot;writer's fatigue&quot;, then the book isn't really a bad read.
B000089RVX|5.0|What's prevented me from buying CDs in the past is that you would only want one or just a few of the songs.  This CD is fabulous because every song on it will strike a chord with you.  Its got a more serious attitude than a lot of music but you'll find yourself listening to it for hours.  Just plain fantastic.
B00009V7T2|4.0|There is hardly any doubt this was 2003 best music album. The complex mix of classic rock, progressive rock, Santana, after punk, electronic sounds and so many things miraculously work straight to your brain like heroin and the more you hear it, the more you like it. Some people have criticized them for being pretentious. Without people like The Mars Volta, the world of music would be just filled with copies of Britneys at the stores. Actually, we need more people with the courage and the talent of these guys. My reason for giving this already classic album 4 stars instead of five it's because I think the production could have been much better. Omar Rodriguez's ego is too high sometimes as he shows in their live performances (even though he is such a great guitar) and just for the sake of pulling down Cedric's amazing voice with the purpose of not &quot;losing startdome&quot;, he puts some songs in fields where they go nowhere. In short, the album would be even better with 5-10 minutes less of wandering. And that's the main responsability of a producer whose personality is much lower than Omar's super ego. I hope next time they hire a guy who can pronounce the word &quot;no&quot;. All in all, an extraordinary album. I hope they continue for a long, long time.
0393325172|5.0|What is it that makes a book into a film?  Connections, best-seller status?  Certainly there are many pathways, and fewer pathways to success.  For example who would have thought that the story of the Passion might become a billion dollar success?  Tens of hundreds of years after it was written?<br />So comes the author Patrick O'Brian.  Shortly before his death in 1997, Professor Robert Herman of the University of Texas at Austin (Physics and Engineering), one of the very last Renaissance men of his generation, brought O'Brian to my attention.  Mind you, Dr. Herman was well-versed in all of the classics, in original Russian, German, French, English, and perhaps more.  An it was &quot;Master and Commander&quot; that he brought to my attention as a great work of literature.  So, naturally I bought the book, and read it--in the pre-film edition.  Never did I dream this would become a successful film starring the Oscar-winning Russell Crowe, whom I'd come to respect years before &quot;Gladiator&quot;.  A great combination.  I would not review the film here...however, anyone who has not seen the film, but wishes to read a truly great work in English literature of the 20th century, must become familiar with Patrick O'Brian, and I cannot find a better work with which to begin!!!<br />Highly recommended, readable, a page turner.  Like many such works, the film is not only in another genre, but must be judged by different standards.  By any standard, this is a book to be read, re-read, and given as a gift to any appreciator of great fiction on a grand scale!!!
B00006LFGD|1.0|Well, thankfully Streisand finally got off her high horse and recorded a duet with Barry.  Does anyone else out there think it was because Barry's &quot;Ultimate Manilow&quot; CD went platinum while Bab's &quot;Essential&quot; CD kinda just stood there?  Then, after the catastrophic failure of &quot;Essential&quot;, her record company releases another (basically) hits CD - this one!  I guess the folks at Columbia (or wherever she's recording nowadays) think we need a fifth or sixth copy of the same old songs.  <br />You know, I really love Barb's voice, and there are some really pretty songs on this CD, and I understand it isn't Streisand saying &quot;Hey, I know - release another Greatest Hits CD.  Everybody's doing it!&quot;..., but apart from the Manilow duet, you really don't need this CD.  Wait for it to go into the $9.99 bin at WalMart.<br />I only say this because I simply cannot recommend to fans out there to keep spending good money on the same old recordings over and over again.  No one needs five CD's of the same song, digitally remastered or not.  It's still the same song!  And if the excuse is, &quot;We're putting it out there for new, younger fans...&quot; you can just come out from under the smoke cloud.  No sixteen year old is rushing to the stores to get the latest Streisand release.  Her faithful fans are buying less and less as well.  I used to buy everything she put out, but I stopped after &quot;Back to Broadway&quot;.  It's like she just doesn't care anymore, and her music has really suffered for it.
0671042858|5.0|I loved this book.  It is not one of King's back-breaking, eye-strainig 800+ page book.  It is a breath of fresh air.  It follows the lines of a classic horror movie where you're not sure if the mosnter is real or not.  It is saturated in lovely symbolism and addresses issues like religion and self realization.  You actually begin to love the main character.  As a warning, this is not your typical overly-words, pedantic King. This gets straight to the point and is a very fast read, but worth reading more than once.  One of my favorite books, ever!
B000002KD5|5.0|This album is the album that made Fleetwood Mac one of the Greatest Rock Bands in history!!! It spawns the top 20 hits Rhiannon, Say You Love Me, and Over My Head, and songs like World Turning, I'm So Afraid, Landslide, and Monday Morning, whitch should have been released as hit singles!!! All in all a great album! This album has 7 of Fleetwood Macs greatest songs ever and will be remembered for centuries to come!!!! But it! you wont be sorry!Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and more than deserves it!!!
B000002B1M|5.0|although the ryhmes aren't as startling like it was on illmatic, it was written has one of the greatest hip-hop songs ever, the massege, street dreams, if i ruled the world, i gave you power, take it in blood, shootouts, those songs are masterpieces, just dont compare it to illamtic, and then you'll realize how dope this album is, easiely a classic, a must-have for all hip-hop fans.
B00007JVBI|5.0|I first became aware of Cat Power music through an interesting woman I met on the internet. She suggested the &quot;You Are Free&quot; CD for the best listen. I looked it up, read a few rather mixed reviews and purchased the CD. It arrived on a Saturday afternoon; I played it that evening. I was feeling weary of the world, somewhat lonely and I was sitting in a dimly-lit room. A half bottle of reasonably good Merlot was by my side and my cat, JR, was napping on the coffee table. I can't think of a better setting in which to first hear this wonderful music.<br />Cat Power is basically Chan Marshall, who accompanies herself on guitar and piano, plus a small assortment of supporting musicians. Every song on the CD is excellent but I have strong preferences for some. On four of the tracks (Free, Speak for Me, He War and Shaking Paper) Chan is accompanied by a small band and on one track (Evolution) she sings a duet with a very subdued and backgroundish Eddie Vedder. All are first rate and provide variety. The real strength of the album, however, lies with the other nine tracks (I Don't Blame You, Good Woman, Werewolf, Fool, Babydoll, Maybe Not, Names, Half of You and Keep on Runnin'). Here Chan functions essentially as a soloist singing and playing piano or guitar. It might be easy to criticize her as a vocalist, instrumentalist or writer as the music is so simple. However, the melodic combination she presents provides a presence so strong that it feels as if you have a cherished friend in the room playing some wonderful songs just for you. Add to this a masterly arrangment that lightly and elegantly blends little touches of electric guitar, cello, violin and voices and gives a music of astonishing charm, beauty and depth. I have trouble with the lyrics and I listen intently wondering what this wonderful lady is trying to tell me, but then Names cuts right to the bone. Marvelous presentation! So, what are my favorites? That's a difficult choice as they're all so outstanding. As I'm writing this I'd say Good Woman, Werewolf and Babydoll. Perhaps tomorrow it might be Maybe Not, Names and Half Of You. Maybe sometime else, some of the others.<br />Thank you Chan; It's a exquisite album.ding. As I'm writing this I'd say Good Woman, Werewolf and Babydoll.

B00008J4P5|5.0|I hadn't heard or seen the White Stripes up until about a month ago when a friend lent Elephant to my husband. I was hooked after the first listen. This is a great album. I love it all the way through. I normally dislike mainstream music but I haven't been this turned on by a band since I discovered Bowie, X or Sonic Youth.  <br />I read a few of the negative reviews and though I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion, I was surprised at how completely I disagreed with the negative arguments. One reviewer states that their minimalism is due to lack of talent. I'll use a cliche- it often takes more talent to make something interesting and compelling in art, design or music with less. The White Stripes achieve this brilliantly. Besides, it feels very full and well rounded, not sparse/empty like &quot;minimalism&quot; would suggest. <br />I don't miss the bass surprisingly and my husband is a bassist! I like Meg's 2 simple beats and Jack's sloppy-ish guitar. It works for them. The lyrics are sometimes silly but it's rock and roll.  It's fun.  There's something very charismatic about these two. <br />I don't suppose that the White Stripes are for everyone's tastes; a mom reviewer thought they were too &quot;heavy&quot;, and some are hung up on music being technically pristine or genre adhering. I don't like the White Stripes because they're cute or on MTV, I just think they rock. <br />They are kinda cute though...
B0000TLA9G|3.0|first off i would like to say that anything short of 2 discs is not enough for a best of g n'r album, and secondly, i think people should save thier money....axl did not want this album released and neither did slash or duff....one of the reasons was the song selection. all of these songs are great. that is true, but if you really want to have the best of g n' r BUY their studio albums, and throw in the live album for good measure....you will, then, have everything you need....this album was only released to make the record company money, and the more people who give into their greed, the more albums like this will see the light of day. in short....great band, great songs....but missing about 15 more songs....save your money and buy their back catalogue.
B000089CJI|5.0|I was turned onto this album by a fellow patron at our local music store and wow...glad I was there that day.  This is like nothing I've heard before.  You can't convey just how good it is, you have to experience for yourself.  I can't wait for more.
B00018TI5E|3.0|i'm a big fan of john frusciante. i own all his albums, and i was very excited when this one came out. the first listens were amazing, but then the album went boring. it is quite one dimensional- what you hear is what you get. i think his other albums are much deeper, i had to listen to them several times before getting a hold on them, and they give me something new with every listen. but not this one. it's so polished and structured, all the rough elements that were in john's music are taken away. the falsetto off-key singing, the loose song structures, that was what i loved in john's music. the personality and the way he expressed his felings and left the listener totally breathless, almost crying.<BR>of course this is a great album, it's full of great songs, catchy melodies and good singing. john has envolved, and for the first time, he's finished an album totally. it's good, but i'd expect something more than just great pop songs from this man. this would be totally amazing if someone else would've done it, but john frusciante is in my opinion one of the most honest and talented musicans there is nowdays, he could do so much more touching stuff. but if this is what he wants right now, ok, next time we'll get something else.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This CD reissue has finally released the full original LP version of the song &quot;SARA&quot; by Stevie Nicks ... all 6:30 minutes!!! <br />The first CD release only had an edited single version (AH! How could they do that to such a great song?) <br />If you love this song as much as I do, CD-2 has a bonus track  of &quot;SARA&quot; with the time of 8:48 minutes.  A great alternative version to have in your Fleetwood Mac collection!<br />Stevie Nicks sounds exceptional on this reissue CD.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst cd I have ever listened to.  The songs have no substance at all.  These songs are repetitive, old, and just not good musically.  Limp Bizkit is an aweful band and I can' t see how they became so popular.  <br />I am just glad that a friend burnt me this cd, so I didn' t waste my money on this crap.  I am just glad that Limp Bizkit is gone and they will never be back on the top of the charts.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I've just come back from watching &quot;Taking Lives&quot;, as awful a piece of Hollywood trash as it's been my misfortune to see in a long time. <br />Movies like that make you wonder why you ever liked movies in the first place. <br />Thankfully the memory of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is there to remind me that films can be illuminating and sensitive and contain real human beings that we might actually encounter.<br />I'm heartily weary of movies that have simple-minded bad guys and good guys, and murders, and no sense of believable characterisation for either. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is more like a superbly realised short story. Think of the stories of Richard Ford, Andre Dubus, and Graham Greene. The Dubus connection reminds me. If you liked &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; for its avoidance of movie cliches and its honest look at fallible characters in a sad situation you might well get a lot from &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.
0375413405|5.0|I'm delighted to see that Julia's cornerstone book has been re-issued.  It is a must.  If I were sent to a desert island and allowed to bring only two cookbooks I'd take this and Joy of Cooking.  Julia adds not only relatively more sophisticated recipes, but the techniques Joy lacks.  Beard's Theory and Practice of Cooking would be third on my list for a new cook. <br />Begining cooks need not be intimidated by Julia's book.  At the time it was written most Americans had no knowledge of French cooking.  This was THE book designed to introduce Frence ingredients, recipes and techniques.  It still does that with good illustrations and recipes any cook can execute to perfection.   Experienced cooks will be delighted with the variety of excellent recipes, many well suited to low carb cooking.  This a book that has served me well for over 30 years.
B00005A8H5|5.0|Hopefully everyone has seen the movie because it is top notch. The first time the sound track came out a couple of key tracks were left off (Righteous Brothers- you've lost that lovin feelin) Big mistake! But they made it all good by re releasing it. This CD stays in my player.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|This classic slob comedy, which was on par with the slightly more refined nostalgia piece, \\"Grease\\" in the summer of '78 , gives a frank look at fraternity life. There is a certain irony to the fact that the rowdy members of the Delta fraterinity become Society's leaders and the more straight-laced Omegas don't fare so well.But that's life, at least sometimes.<BR> We are taken back to 1962 where two freshmen at Faber College, played by Tom Hulce and Stephen Furst, visit fraternity houses to decide whether or not they should pledge to one. They arrive first at the stately Omega House, where well-groomed name tag hostesses Bab Jansen and Mandy Pepperidge(played by Martha Smith and Mary Louise Weller), add a bit of warmth to the chilly formality of the evening. The two prospective pledges are made a bit more uncomfortable by the heads of the fraternity, Greg Marmalard(James Daughton)and the sadistic cadet Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalfe) as they cool heels with the fraternity's token minorities.<BR> Then they encounter the more honestly repulsive beer guzzling Deltas whose ramshackle frat house could be taken down by a gust of wind. It is hard to imagine why they would be inspired to join the most disreputable fraternity on campus after  viewing the behavior of the subhuman and frequently monosyllabic Bluto (John Belushi in his definitive role). But after a friendly chat with Katie(Karen Allen), Larry Kroger makes up his mind to become a Delta and legacy Kent Dorffman follows suit.<BR> We follow the frat boys through many an illicit and illegal adventure, including whiffing pot with the English Professor(Donald Sutherland), stealing food from a local supermarket, affairs with the Dean's wife and the Mayor's underage daughter, their infamous drunken toga party, and acting as the bereaved boyfriend of a co-ed who died in a kiln explosion to gain sympathy and have flings with the dead student's roomate and her friends.Ickier scenes include watching Greg Marmalard on his dates.Funnier ones include Bluto's smashing  singer/composer Stephen Bishop's guitar after hearing him butcher a song-an act for which he need not have apologized. <BR> The cast also includes the womanizing Eric Stratton, played by  Tim Matheson, Pieter Riegert as Katie's on-again-off-again boyfriend Donald (\\"Boon\\") Schernstein, John Vernon as Dean Wormer, who remains comically unphased by many a fraternity prank that befalls him, Verna Bloom as his addictive wife, Cesare Danova as the extortionist Mayor, Sarah Holcolmb as his jailbait daughter who sneaks off with Larry Kroger, Douglas Kenny,a co-writer of the film  as Stork, James Widdowes as Hoover, De Wayne Jessie as Otis Day, and Bruce McGuill as the outrageous D-Day. Kevin Bacon makes and early appearance as a new member of the Omegas.<BR>  The film fluctuates between comedy and crassness, as we alternately watch the frat boys either kiss up to  or completely aliente authority figures, most of who are rather corrupt themselves, and ultimately ends in the chaos of a wrecked homecoming parade. But it is rather amusing to see how later in life, some of the Deltas would channel their energies and libidos into more constructive professions. Perhaps some of them completely leave certain decadent behaviors behind them. But we know most of these beer-guzzling, toga-partying lechers only as they are at this early stage in their adult lives--a cradle of libertines.
0385504209|5.0|One of the best, if not the best, books I have ever read. It is intelligent and extremely thought provoking. Unlike other typical thrillers, this one adds historical content to make the plot truly intriguing. A great read!
B000060P79|3.0|Seriously, some of the reviews bashing this CD are kind of getting to me. I listened to the CD only to review it, and while it's not particularily original I can't stand some of these horrendous reviews. While a few people who attacked Simple Plan actually checked out the CD there are people who attack just because they saw them on MTV and it makes them feel cool to make fun of them. Case in point, before this band was on MTV at all this CD had 5 stars, after they got big the &quot;hardcore punk rockers&quot; and other people who have prejudice against the genre as a whole come and give the CD 1 star. You think you have some great musical insight because you listen to a couple of underground bands. One reviewer even had the gaul to say something along the lines of &quot;you'll thank me for enlightening you some day.&quot; What this reviewer should have said was &quot;one day I'll realize how self reightous I am.&quot; <br />For the record, I am not a pop-punk fan whatsoever. I'm more of a prog rock guy myself, so you can't get on me for liking simplistic formulaic music. I listen to Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Anathema, etc. These bands are FAR more original than anything I've heard in punk, save perhaps Thrice(whom I happen to think are eons ahead of AFI, but thats just me.) I gusse all I'm really trying to say is this: Self Reightous reviewers need to get over themselves and find a better way to spend their time.
B00000I07P|3.0|Slippery When Wet is an alright album but its way to over produced and its too commercial. Yes I realize Bon Jovi, so their a hair band so that means every thing they make will be commercial but come on. Bon Jovi is not hard rock, not a single hair band is hard rock, ok they were about as hard rock as Journey was. But dont get me wrong some of them were good and Bon jovi is one of the few.<br />Slippery When Wet is by far Bon Jovis best album 'Livin On A prayer' is a great love song, 'Lat It Rock' is a pretty decent rock song, 'You Give Love A Bad Name' is also a pretty decent rock song, and 'Raise Your Hands' is alright. Now 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' is one of the greatest songs ever recorded, writen and produced. The 12 string by Rhichie Sambora is killer and Jon Bon Jovi dont sound bad himself.<br />This is a good album but like I said I've heard better but by Bon Jovi it dont get better then this, and dont be fooled by other reviewers Bon Jovi is not the best herd rock band since Led Zeppelin, I mean come on people lets use some since!!!!
B000002UUX|5.0|yes it is<BR>all the songs are masterpiece<BR>the riff are totally master<BR>the solos are incredible<BR>the drum, the bassline all of them rlz!<BR>no weak track except down patrol but its only filler track , only drum and bassline and dave saying something. but it's still fit with the album sounding<BR>hangar 18,take no prisoner and holy wars are he first 3 track that will made reliase how great they are <BR>the 4 - 9 track are same great as the first three
B000002UB6|4.0|Let It Be....Naked id much better then this! But this also has its moments. All The songs here are good and so it has no low points except for the extremly of produced part. Phil Specter is one of the greatest produces ever and we all know that but what he did to this album was just wrong, the title track sounds completlydiffernt on each album, and 'The Long And Winding Road' completly sucks on this album, I never liked this song till I got it on Let It Be....Naked. Now my biggest complaint about this album is where the hell is 'Dont Let Me Down' that is one of The Beatles top five songs.<br />So this is worth the money if you are a true Beatles fan but if you just want this album for the hits then get Let It Be....Naked becuase the songs sound better, they got rid of the filler and it has 'Dont Let Me Down' which is better then any song on the original album of Let It Be!
B00005V0X5|5.0|this is how to remastered an album , everything are loud and clear, the vocal is full of emotion,speed riff &amp; solo , great drumming and awesome bassline<BR>i order this album from amazon.com and very very satisfied!<BR>masterpiece

1577311760|5.0|To those who are searching,<BR>        &quot;You are here to enable the devine purpose of the universe to unfold that is how important you are&quot; these words never meant so much to me until I read this book.We must remember that everyone is at a differant point in their journey. After reading the various reviews, it is appadrent that there are many who are not ready for what Eckhart is bringing forth. If the NOW does not speak to you, then lay it aside and try it again in a year. I have read hundreds of spiritual books from the Kabbala to a course in miracles. I have now read the power of now 7 times, and listened to it 4 times on audio. His aproach has helped me to understand other teachings. Whenever I am at odds with the world I listen to his audio and find my center. Each time I find somthing that my Ego would not accept before. I beleive he is very specific in the techniqes to quiet the mind. The &quot;mind has become the master when it was meant to be the tool&quot; To stop the endless chatter of the mind is Eckharts teaching. He even states that this is the purpose of meditation.Would you not like to have your entire day be a meditation filled with peace. His technique and message are there if we listen with our being, not our mind. We live in eternity; The past and future emotions, and thoughts overshadow this precious gift - the now. Read the other books but make this a must for your bookshelf. At some point in &quot;time&quot; you will find what every one is looking for. I personly have more peace in my life by practicing the power of now. As Eckhart says &quot;try it and you be the proof&quot;
B00005M989|4.0|If you just want the Prince songs you know by heart from radio overexposure into the new millennium,  this is the one to get.  If you don't wanna run out and own all the albums,  but you liked a lot more from Prince than just 1999 and When Doves Cry, I'd recommend getting either The Hits 1 and The Hits 2,  or The Hits/The B-Sides if you REALLY want a great Prince comp.<br />Every song on this album went top 25 on the Billboard chart, all but 4 (1999, I Wanna Be Your Lover, Get Off and Money Don't Matter 2nite) of these songs went top 10, so this is definately a must-get if you grew up on top 40 in the 1980's and early 90's and want the biggest Prince hits on a single disc.   However, if you know you were more than just the most casual of fans, I'd get the 93 &quot;Hits&quot; collections instead
B00008NRL8|5.0|I first heard &quot;Vuevo al sur&quot; on my Musicmatch radio station and after hearing &quot;Triptico&quot; I knew I had to buy the CD.  I really enjoy the CD and it's great background/party music.  Not all of the songs are as hypnotic as my 4 favorites (the above two, Santa Maria, and Chunga's Revenge), but the video on the extra disc makes it worth 5 stars!<br />Also, a note for the music fan from Lemon Cove, CA: &quot;tango&quot; is actually described as a Latin American genre and the word has numerous meanings.  We are most familiar with the international definition of the tango, which would be Argentinean.  There is, however, a &quot;tango&quot; tradition in Brazil, such as the 'tango brasileiro' (check out Darius Milhaud's pieces based on Brazilian music).  The Brazilian tango is based on the Cuban habanera, but nonetheless carries the title of &quot;tango&quot;.  <br />So, according to your logic (as so eloquently stated in your review), the Russians may actually have their own style of caipirinha.  Probably made with vodka (blech!).
B00003XB8K|5.0|Being the fourth album from the legendary musical mastermind Michael Cretu, it was also at the time the most different (now his fifth album voyageur stands out as the most individual).  I consider this album and Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi to be his (Michael Cretu) best album.  The amazon editorial review said it all.  Of the two questions posed at the end of her review, i must say that Enigma's music is a beautiful union between artificial and indigenous sound.   This album is beautiful.  Tracks that stand out the most are &quot;Between Mind and Heart&quot; &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; and the second track, which i forgot the name of.  Buy this album!
B000060P79|5.0|Whoever thinks that they aren't talented must be crazy. They are amazing artists with lots of talent.  Their songs have lots of meaning, and most could relate to what they say. They have tons of energy in their songs, and I think most would enjoy it. I don't even think that I could pick a single track that I like most, because I love them all. I actually saw them live and they were magnificent. Not only are they amaizing artests, they are also wonderful people, and that carries into their music. They put a lot of care into their music and I think most would love this C.D
B00005OMTT|5.0|Spirituality enhancing music has never been as entrancing and alluring in the history of music.  Never have I been so at one and felt so at home with music as I have been with this lush comilation of Enigma's Phase One (first four albums) greatest hits.  Almost all of Michael Cretu's music should be on this cd because his music is so inspiring...it takes you on a mind altering journey through sound from which you may wish never to return, simply because of its fresh, pure musical taste.  <br />    Many of the tracks that made it on this cd are there because they were on the top of the charts.  Not all of them are necesarily his absolute best...I wish songs like &quot;Between Mind and Heart&quot; and &quot;Callas Went Away&quot; were here, but the exclusion of those songs doesn't deteriorate the value.  Even if Curly M.C. wanted to put more tracks on his Greatest Hits,  he would have had to opt for a second disc because....theres already 74 minutes of pure heaven on the single disc.  Anyway, explaining M.C.'s unique vision of music is next to impossible to explain; the songs are a mix of rhythmic beats, breathy vocals, synthed orchestration, and mystical lyrics, which are refrences to the Bible in some parts.  Sampling the music is the only way to discover the beauty.  Languages include Latin, French, and English.  The quality of the synthesized sounds sound like they could have been made yesterday, which is an example of the talent and effort put into every Enigma cd.<br />   Now I may sound like a paid advertiser for Enigma, but I am in reality a very down to earth guy.  So I tell it like it is.  This review is no exeption.  The samples so kindly provided by Amazon above are not the best...M.C. likes to launch each of his cds with slow orchestrations, and then he picks up the pace with the third track.  Really, only allowing thirty seconds of sampling doesn't quite do the cd justice.  To become absorbed into a piece, you have to listen to the whole thing.  <br />please, dont illegally download music if you do....it hurts the artist from which you are stealing.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|WONDERFUL...WONDERFUL....<br />As a single divorced woman in her 50's I found this movie so honest and real.  Sure it's not all fun and games to be in this spot in life, but the movie was true and moving.  Don't listen to \\"moviegirlll\\"  She has to be one very bitter gal.
B000002C4J|4.0|When I say this album is typical of Mrs. Dion I mean that as a compliment, for the most part. But, as always, music takes a distant second to her voice and the album suffers. Annoying songs like \\"Tell Him\\" plague an otherwise great piece. For the most part, the latter half of the album is far more enjoyable with great songs such as \\"To Love You More\\" \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" and the title track \\"Let's Talk About Love.\\" As always, a great one for Dion fans only.
B000051VWW|5.0|I love all her albums, they isn't one better than the other, all her production is very good. And I realised SADE is not that kind of band which fits in an genre, as I have found on &quot;Diamond Life&quot; and &quot;Promise&quot; her jazzy music which changed in &quot;Stronger than Pride&quot;, where she texturized her voice and music more haunting as good as &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; . And you maybe find &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; more different than the rest, after 8 years..<br />This album is dominated by keyboards, and there is some influence of hip-hop beats in &quot;Flow&quot; and &quot;Inmigrant&quot;, trip-hop in Lover's Rock, melancholy on &quot;By your Side&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot;, and a relaxing ending with a sweet melody as &quot;It's Only Love That Get's you Through&quot;. <BR>And saxophone has disappeared, but Shar-Day still having a sensual voice and good music which doesn't have much difference with &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;, for example, if you hear &quot;Cherish the Day&quot; you'll see its &quot;tempo&quot; influence on the songs.<br />Lover's Rock is a quieter album, but I think is more modern, and if you like&quot;Love Deluxe&quot;, or maybe others singers as Dido or Erika Baduh, be sure to have it, still doing fine music, tempo beats, and relaxing with her soulfull voice. She has improved a lot, maybe this is the album I hear more frequently, but I hope she doesn't take too much time to do another great album, SADE has always done fine music on the 80's, 90's, and I hope they still doing haunting  melodies.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|A complete waste of time.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I've been a devout weezer fan for about 3 years now, ever since i first heard undone and buddy holly. I then went right out, and bought the Blue Album. That was three years ago. Since then ive bought Pinkerton, the Green Album, Maladroit, The Lion and the Witch ep and countless singles and a few tribute albums. I've been couting down to this re-release and the new dvd for about 3 months now, and it was well worth the wait. I've had the bsides for a while now on a burned cd a friend gave me. On another review someone said, these b-sides fall short, but i disagree, i think these songs are great. In fact, some of the weezer b-sides are my favorite weezer songs. Jamie for instance. The orginial is a great song, but the live and acoustic version is definately my favorite weezer song of all time. the really great part of this reissue is the demos, the kitchen tapes and the songs that got scrapped from the blue album. the kitchen tapes are great, and that version of Only In Dreams is amazing. and Lullabye for Wayne, a song written for original drummer patt finn when he moved away, is great too. <br />This is the second deluxe edition album ive bought. my first was Catch a Fire by Bob Marley. This packaging is great. Now, im very easily amused, so just the full color picture of the garage behind the cds made me real happy. The liner notes were great too. The hand written lyics are great, and the essay is great, but i really loved the little notes about each bside. <br />All in all, I'd say this cd is worth the money. I just hope that they do this for Pinkerton too.<br />Long live Rivers, Matt, Brian, and Pat(and sometimes Jason)
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Dear Axl Rose,<BR>I have heard and read that you and two of your ex-bandmates(Slash and Duff McKagan) tried to block the release of this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation. You claim it would damage the sales potential of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, which still has not seen daylight despite seven years in the studio and a tour which ended early due to your failure to appear at the scheduled shows. So my question is, shouldn't you be more concerned with finishing &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; than fighting with your record label over a greatest hits package that offers nothing new? Sure, we get &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;, which had never appeared on a GN'R album before...but it's still a 10 year old song from the movie &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot;. Listen, Axl, I'm a fan, and I'll still buy &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; if/when it surfaces, even though it's not the old Guns N' Roses lineup. In the meantime, it's nice to have a little reminder of how explosive your band used to be. All the songs on the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; disc sound like they've been remastered, and tunes like &quot;Paradise City&quot; and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; still pack a solid punch. I think it was a good idea for Geffen Records to release this CD, even if you don't, Axl. Imagine if it sells a million copies...would you think about getting the old band back together THEN?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppala's best to date! i think the critics have had it in for Sofia Coppola for a while.she was a fine actress in my opinion.she is a wonderful writer and her directing is superb.Scarlett Johansson is excellent as is Bill Murray.i found this to be a sweet wistful romance with a bittersweet ending.
0345357116|4.0|This is a nice walk through much of the backstory that Tolkien developed in the process of crafting the Lord of the Rings.  People who are hungry for more will enjoy this.<br />Unlike Lord of the Rings, this isn't a novel.  It is more of a collection of essays, stories and exposition.  However, it is a lot more readable than the Silmarillion.  After reading some of the tales in here, you will sound like a Tolkien guru.  If it hasn't slaked your thirst, you could move on to the much denser Silmarillion.
0451526384|1.0|I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel. It was written later in her life and lacks the emotion and plot that are so captivating in her earlier works. Read 'Pride and Prejudice' instead.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I've been a big Nickelback fan since &quot;The State&quot; was first released about 4 years ago. I loved it, and when &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; came out, I loved it even more. At that point, I figured the band had already hit their high point, and anything else they'd put out would probably only be just ok. Well, after picking up my copy of &quot;The Long Road&quot; last September, I was pleasantly surprised. I really wasn't expecting too much out of this album, but at the end of every song, I found myself saying &quot;YEAH!&quot; The first single, &quot;Someday&quot; is a great song, but for those that thinks it's a watered down version of &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, listen to the rest. &quot;Figured You Out&quot; is also a good song, however, I don't think it's a good choice as a single. &quot;Feelin Way Too Damn Good&quot; is the next single, and again I have to say I love the song, but it's not a good choice as a single. The album's best material is found on tracks like &quot;Believe It Or Not&quot; and &quot;See You At The Show&quot;. It doesn't stop there though, &quot;Flat On The Floor&quot; and &quot;Because Of You&quot; are probably some of the heaviest songs the band has ever written. There's not one bad song on this album! I'd say it's at least as good as &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; if not better. So I urge you to pick this up right away! However, if you have the means...get the limited edition version which features 3 bonus songs: &quot;Learn The Hard Way&quot;, &quot;Yanking Out My Heart&quot; and &quot;Saturday Nights Alright&quot;. Also good songs!
B00009L1OB|5.0|(...)Duran Duran's third album is a postmodern exercise is avant garde rock.  Comparing these guys to Roxy Music is insane since Roxy Music would be nothing without Duran Duran.  Just get this album now.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Where to start... Obviously this is not the true GNR greatest hits. As others are stating, this was put out by the record company alone and obviously it does not include GNR's best work. Now being the GNR freak that I am, and I know there are hundreds if not thousands more out there, I know that it is impossible to contain their greatest songs to only ONE disc. Some of you keep saying that Appetite for Destruction IS their Greatest Hits cd. I guess those who would agree with that haven't even heard other songs like Patience, Used to Love Her, Dead Horse, Don't Damn Me, Bad Apples, Estranged, You Could Be Mine, Get in the Ring, Pretty Tied Up, The Garden and a little song called NOVEMBER F'N RAIN! As any true GNR fan knows there is actually only one \\"bad\\" GNR song: My World, because Axl \\"The D!@k-Head\\" Rose wrote and performed it alone.<br />Back to the disc in question. This CD contains 7 or 8 of the songs that I personally would include on a GNR greatest hits album. I certainly would cut down on the covers. I do have to agree with the inclusion of the Stones cover \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" from the \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" closing credits. I have always wanted that song; I had a crappy, cut short mp3 of it. Also \\"Knockin on Heaven's Door\\" should be included because lets face it, they were more famous for that song than Dylan was. \\"Ain't it Fun\\" is however one of the last songs I would have included on here, I didn't even know that song, I had to go check my copy of \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" to see if it was even on there. I actually bought \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" just for \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" but if I were going to include anything from \\"TSI?\\" it would have been \\"Hair of the Dog\\". \\"Live and Let Die\\" is a great song but definitely doesn't need to be included on GNR's Greatest Hits. Same as \\"Yesterdays\\" and \\"Civil War\\", I really think that they put \\"Civil War\\" on here just because its radio airplay has severely increased since 9/11.<br />So to wrap it up, thisobviously is not a true Greatest Hits album for one of the greatest band in the history of rock. If you actually do not have any GNR albums, do not buy this and believe that you have all their best work. For new listeners I would suggest Appetite > Illusions I> Illusions II > Lies > Live Era > Spaghetti Incident? > then proceed to this so called greatest hits if you, like me, just needed a quality version of Sympathy for the Devil. Also this CD only cost me 7 dollars so I really don't feel bad about spending that little bit to keep my collection complete.<br />As a final note to all GNR fans: PLEASE do not buy or even pay attention to Chinese Democracy, if it ever comes out. Axl ruined the band at its highest point; do not let him make a mockery of the great name of Guns 'N Roses with this sideshow he hired to play other people's music. There are better cover bands out there, and I'll bet that their lead singers will sound more like Axl than Axl sounds like Axl. You really can't call yourself a fan of Guns 'N Roses if you will buy that crap. And there is now way you could even expect it to sound anything like the real band, because it isn't the real band. For real post-GNR work pay close attention to Slash, Duff, and Matt with Scott Weiland in the Velvet Revolver. Their first album \\"Contraband\\" is due out Summer '04.

B00006RCNJ|1.0|This is another one of Andre's live performances. The music is superb as is the music on his other DVD's and CD's. However, the colors are really terrible and the glare very apparent. The DVD should have been reworked so that viewing the performance would not be such a pain. Just compare this DVD and the DVD of Rieu's Dublin performance.     Advice: skip this DVD and get the \\"Live in Dublin\\" DVD. That one is really a jewel, in every way!
B0000AQS0F|3.0|Firefly is well cast and has an interesting premise,so why doesn't it quite work.<BR>Well,for one thing this space show has country and western music on the soundtrack instead of the traditional classical music. This does not work and spoils the show.<BR>Another rather silly thing is that they have white and black people cursing in an asian language. They don't speak in an asian language,they just curse in it. How silly is that?<BR>The producer needs to learn that self indulgent producing equals TV sets turned off.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is the best CD that I have ever heard in these modern times. The downfall of tATu is thanks to their false lesbianism, and if they had not pretended but just put out their music, they would have been the world's biggest group. I truly and honestly believe that. It's very immoral to fake homosexuality for profit, but it didn't work out anyway.<br /> But they left behind some of the best dance tracks ever recorded in their shadow..<br /> Every lyric (mostly from dance genius Trevor Horn or manager Ivan Shapovalov) seems masterfully penned, from track one to track eight (Yes, there are eight unique tracks on this CD) and every note seems perfectly plotted. The dark &quot;Clowns&quot; strikes a string in your heart, the solemn and powerful cover (dare I say better than the original?) of &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; is breathtaking, and the poetic flow of &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; leaves the listener only wanting more from tATu.<br /> Their CD is certified Gold in the United States. And I swear on my life it would have been multi-platinum had they been marketed correctly instead of fake lesbians. <br /> The best CD of the millenium thus far, based on quality over quantity. I honestly think that. (That is...if you can put up with the manufactured voice here and there..most seems real, though in dog-whistle tone..)<br />  BOTTOM LINE: The right lane to choose with your $15..<BR>  GRADE: A+
B00005YU1O|1.0|First of all, the philosophy of this film is juvenile.  (...)  You know, it is possible to \\"get\\" something and still not like it.<BR>On a serious note; do not watch this if you are epileptic.  Since the frames are rotoscoped entirely by hand, they do not line up precisely from one frame to the next.  This results in a strobing effect that left me with a splitting headache within 2 minutes, and left me nauseous within 5.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|This is another great movie from Russell Crowe after such gems like \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".<br /> Unlike many pirate ship movies that portray pirate life as sunshine adventures of fun and happiness fighting bad guys, M&C showcases the true side of what it's like being a pirate or a member of a ship crew during the early 1800s: Bleak, depressing, and uncertain. To me, this is very good.<br /> Some scenes in some areas of the movie were a bit hard to stomach in my opinion but overall, this is a really good movie. This is a DVD worth having.
B00004TDTO|3.0|Jaws was the movie that made Speilberg a great hit.  The suspence, fear, and brilliance it provided made everyone love it.  My parents liked it, but when I watched it with them, I could only ask, &quot;Where is the realism?&quot;<br />The story of Jaws is simple: A Great White is terrorizing the citiens of Amity Island, and the mayor is too heartless to stop it, so three men must go out and face it.  Thrill scenes, screaming, blood, and all-around good qualities for a suspence movie could help Jaws if they would only give a little bit of thought to what a Great White really is like.<br />The beginning of the movie was realistic.  It was dark, the girl was swimming like a fish, and the shark was active.  She was eaten, and was perfectly clear to be eaten.  And I suppose the fishing boat later on, since found in the dark, MAY have held some realism, since Great Whites will ram boats.  But most of the movie made me just want to shake my head.<br />First off, would you be dumb enough to go into waters containing a Great White just because the mayor told you to?  I don't think I would.  Would you allow your kid into the water?  Probably not.  Heck, would you even go to the beach?  If you knew the danger, most likely not.  The behavior of the people in the movie was a little unrealistic.  The panicking while attacked was realistic.  Still going into the water was not.  People can be clueless, yes, but that bad?<br />But the worse of all must be the shark behavior.  First off, Great White Sharks live in Australia.  Amity Island is up in New England, USA.  What's wrong with this picture?  Jaws may have been a rogue shark, but since when does a tropical shark survive in cold water?  The conditions may have been just good enough for the shark, but it is fairly unlikely.  Also, the movie said Great Whites were most active at night.  Then how come 50% of the attacks and action takes place during the day?  Explaination, please!<br />Continuing on, Jaws gets shot who-knows-how-many-times during the last few scenes.  May I ask why his strength did not diminish?  Why didn't other sharks (yes, smaller sharks do live in that area) come along and at least try to chomp on him?  In fact, are there any fish there at all?  It seemed as if Jaws was the only fish around and that he only ate people -- Very unrealistic.  Believe it or not, sharks normally do not attack people unless provoked or if you are bleeding/swimming.  &quot;Jaws&quot; sort of kept to that concept, thankfully, but the amount of shark attacks within a few days was a little much for me.  Thank Goodness the shark was given a bit of cunning, but after bleeding for a while, I think the shark should've given out.<br />There were also a few not-so-important-yet-still-annoying little things.  First off, during the last few scenes, the researcher declared that he couldn't move the boat's wheel.  The next scene, he was moving it fine.  Also, the ship would be sinking in one scene, then not be as far underwater in the next.  At some points the shark clearly looks fake, though I guess you can't expect much from the 1970s.<br />Ultimately, I guess I don't have much to say.  &quot;Jaws&quot; did a good job with suspence and action, but realism lacked, causing its ratings to drop in my eyes.  If you want a suspenceful movie, look no further than this.  If you want a realistic yet suspenceful movie, I advise staying away.ny-times during the last few scenes.

B0000087ZE|5.0|I was absolutely amazed with Deep Forests debut album. It was and still is one of the most groundbreaking world music albums of all time and it's a huge crime that it isn't carried by retailers. It is still an amazing CD to this very day. It blended Pygmy voices with modern dance and the result was a masterpiece. This follow-up to that album entitled &quot;Boheme&quot; raises the bar even higher by having Deep Forest travel from the remoteness of Sub-Saharan Africa, to the forests of Bulgaria and Eastern Europe and the result is beyond what I could give out and &quot;Boheme&quot; is in my opinion, Deep Forest's best album to date although &quot;Music Detected&quot; may offer competition. The album has a much darker and more dramatic undertone than their debut album does but I love it.<br />&quot;Anasthasia&quot; starts the album on a dark, eerie, and slightly ominous note with a very tribal sound with haunting flutes and a haunting ambience that gives the song a feel of like drifting through the forests of the Alps with nearby storms. Eventually the song gets more and more intense until it suddenly ends at just less than two minutes length. The echoes of &quot;Anashthasia&quot; perfect blend into the drama of my favorite track on this album &quot;Bohemian Ballet&quot;. This is one of their best 'studio' album tracks that they've ever created. At first, the clanging dance sound effects would imply a Latin folk track but it becomes a very intense, dramatic, and dark song. Things get even better when it becomes a vibrant and energetic dance song with haunting and bizarrely amplified Eastern European voices backed by the intense melody. This song is my favorite song on this entire album. &quot;Marta's Song&quot; is sheer beauty. After the dramatic darkness of &quot;Bohemian Ballet&quot;, we emerge into the sunniness of &quot;Marta's Song&quot; which is another one of the highlights of this album. The song has a really excellent and exotic rhythm and the same is said about the haunting Bulgarian chants as well. Add that to a really warm and energetic melody and you have a really uplifting classic for the coming ages. &quot;Gathering&quot; is a much darker and more ominous track with a very futuristic production yet it also blends in ancient chorus and a really dark but never forboding atmosphere to create another intriguing and amazing classic. &quot;Lament&quot; is a really heartbreaking yet joyous song with a very strange electronic voice effect and bizarrely amplified voice effects. The melody is really awesome as well and the result is another highlight on this album. &quot;Bulgarian Melody&quot; is the strangest track on this CD. Although it starts with a dark and very eerie note and growing more and more dramatic, it calms down and becomes a very odd piano ballad with Bulgarian vocals amidst sweet and beautiful background piano in the background which almost gives the song a slight 1940s tone to it. While I totally disagree with a reviewer saying that this song is god-awful, it does feel sort of out of place against the other songs on this album but nonetheless it is a really great song. As it reverts back to the eerie sound that was present at the beginning, it morphs into a sweeter melody which becomes the track &quot;Deep Folk Song&quot; which is just a one minute interlude track but has a really vibrant French accordion style to it. In a way it's more of like an interlude intro into the vibrant classic &quot;Freedom Cry&quot;. This is a really fun and actually a very bright, sunny and really happy song without being cheesy and is actually a very sophisticated song with an edgy and funky beat and a French accordion sound to it that gives the idea of a dance in an open paved plaza in Paris right after a storm moves out. A really amazing song it is. The song gracefully transitions into the next song &quot;Twosome&quot; which is another highlight on this album. This song has a rather slightly ominous melody but also a very joyous and exotic dance club sound. The Eastern Indian chanting gives the song a really colorful sound. It's hard to really explain this track but it's a really awesome song that needs a listen. &quot;Caf&eacute; Europa&quot; is a really strange track with a stormy vibe and Asian exotic instruments. The song becomes a very club-oriented dance song that surely would make for excellent dance club music. While it's a very good song, it doesn't stack up as high as the other songs on this album. Still, it's a great song. The live version is incredible! &quot;Kathrina&quot; is a very spooky track. It begins with a very misty sharp-sounding flute or other wind instrument and becomes a very dark and haunting track with African beats and strange ominous melody. This is the darkest track on this album and it's a good one at that! The album closes with what I can safely say is the best track on this album which is the title track to this CD. While much of the album is dark and somewhat stormy in nature, the closing title track has a very happy and absolutely uplifting vibe and has a funky and exotic rhythm and colorful vocal effects. To me, this is like the sun shining bright after a major storm moving away into the east. This song brings an already phenomenal album to a glorious finish.<br />Their debut album may have been what brought them into the spotlight but the way I look at it, &quot;Boheme&quot; was where they reached their peak although &quot;Music Detected&quot; may offer competition but these two albums have enormously different styles that it's impossible to compare them but they both showed that Deep Forest were unafraid to go into uncharted territory with their music. &quot;Boheme&quot; to me, built on the greatness of their debut and the result is what I consider to possibly be their best album that they've ever put out to date.

B00000J8EK|4.0|This was my introduction to the Chemical Brothers. I didn't know what to expect. I heard a few songs off of Dig Your Own Hole, but I kept hearing that this album was completely different. Well, that's not exactly true, but it is a good listen. &quot;Music: Response&quot; is quite interesting. It sounds like 1985 rap beats with some weird robot voices. Under The Influence seems to most liked song from the album. I find it to be ok. Nothing spectacular. Out Of Control has the singer from New Order singing and playing guitar on it. This one is quite entertaining. My absoulte favorite songs would have to be Orange Wedge, The Sunshine Underground, and Hey Boy Hey Girl. Those 3 songs alone are worth the price. Orange Wedge is a attempt to do DJ Shadow-like material. The Sunshine Underground is a very pshycadelic song that just builds and builds. And Hey Boy Hey Girl just rules. The only song I didn't like was Asleep From Day. It never went anywhere. I reccomend this album if you're mildly or really into electronica. Enjoy.
0385336810|1.0|I got this book the day it came out, because i was  really looking forward to Sophie Kinsella's next realease. The book was still very well written and funny at times, but i felt as though the plot was a little predictable. The book is very easy to read but i preferred the shopaholic series. All in all, it was a good book but i suggest that you borrow it, not buy it. Before i purchase a book i read a lot of reviews to make sure its worth my time. I hope this review is helpful to you.
B00005QIPH|4.0|While I don't believe that The Strokes are the saviors of rock and roll (It never needed saving. There will always be some kids who will pick up instruments and get famous), I do think that they make some pretty good music. The Strokes are a cross between Television and The Velvet Underground, so if you like those 2 bands, you'll certainly like The Strokes. These guys are rooted in jangly punk rock and it shows. Songs like The Modern Age and Barely Legal would fit perfectly on Marquee Moon or White Light White Heat. Of course, there also are the hits Last Nite and Someday, which are the poppiest of the 11 tracks on here. One song that suprised me was When It Started. The bass line is very complex, and it sounds a bit like The Bends-era Radiohead. My absolute favorie would have to be Alone, Together. It has a kickass guitar riff and Julian Casablancas doing his best Lou Reed impersonation. The only problems with this album is that after a while, the songs get a little repeatitve and the 2nd half isn't as strong as the 1st. But it is a good debut. Try it out sometime. I think you'll like it.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|\\"The Day After\\" is a superior production that is much more powerful than fans of \\"Threads\\" would have you believe.  Yes, \\"Threads\\" was a good film, but quite a bit overrated.  Where \\"The Day After\\", I felt, was more powerful than \\"Threads\\" was in the suspensful build up to the initial attack, as well as the attack scenes themselves.  The attack scenes, particularly the actual nuclear detonations were far more realistic and frightening than those of \\"Threads.\\"  In \\"The Day After\\", we see terrifying scenes of the missiles being launched, demonic mushroom clouds rising over the horizon, and huge walls of flame engulfing entire cities.  \\"Threads\\" merely showed a few building on fire and the actual explosions of the bombs looked like dynamite explosions in somemone's backyard, and were rather quite fake-looking.  Also, the cinematography really looks dated, as if was made in the early seventies.  I'd have to say that the main strong points of \\"Threads\\" were the fairly realistic aftermath scenes as well as the scientific information regarding the effects that the war would have on the earth. \\"Threads\\", overall, seemed to lack the frightful atmosphere that \\"The Day After\\" did so well in relaying.<br />If anyone wants to see a truly worthy British effort, my advice is to check out \\"The War Game.\\"  That film, I felt, was, far superior to \\"Threads\\" in that it contained a much more hard-hitting atmosphere and really did a marvelous job at showing the frightening amount of apathy that the general populace had toward a possible nuclear attack.  Also, the special effects were quite ahead of their time, especially for a film that was made in 1965.<br />So, bottom line, for anyone that hasn't seen \\"The Day After\\", don't be fooled by some of the negative reviews given here by fans of \\"Threads\\".  It is definitely a film that is worth watching and will probably be one of the most powerful and gripping experiences you will ever have, besides watching \\"The War Game\\", that is.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane was ranked number one on the AFI's list of the 100 Greatest American Movies (which really needs to be updated) and is not undeserving of its position on that list. One can argue that Casablanca, The Godfather, or Gone With the Wind should be the top movie, but one cannot say that Citizen Kane is not an outstanding movie.  The movie is about the life of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane, his triumphant rise in popularity among the people, and his horrible downfall.  You have no right to decide what the greatest movie of all time is if you have never seen Citizen Kane.
B000005S0E|4.0|I am a big fan of The Cure and have followed them since the late '70s.  At the time of this album's release, there was much turmoil around the Cure. This album is largely a solo effort.  Many of the band members were feuding with Robert Smith and he did quite a bit of the recording himself.  Smith was off on a bender, with too much booze, mental agitation, and who knows what else, tying him in a knot.  As such, this is not your typical Cure album - it captures a wandering leader and a band in an indeterminate state.  The music is all over the map, from the rattling angst of Shake Dog Shake to the mild pop of The Caterpillar.  The album finishes off with Smith's plea, \\"please come back... all of you\\" which was interpreted at the time to be quite likley his despair over the band disintegrating around him.  If you are a fan who prefers the poppier, lighter later work of The Cure, this may not be the album for you.  It is not dark, in the goth-ish sense of Pornography, but it is dark in the sense that it feels like you are listening to someone who's gone over the line.  If you want a raw view into Smith's psyche at the time, this is am idiosynchratic and rewarding album.
B00012QM9K|3.0|I was very excited to see the DVD of Schindler's List finally released. So excited, in fact, that I bought the Collector's Edition. To my dismay, it was not a very exciting collection.<br />Before I get to that, I will just state that the movie is as good as ever and it has been some time since I have seen it. The quality is clean and clear, while sound is great. This is a film that utilizes the widescreen aspect and should be seen in this format (why they even offer a full screen is beyond my comprehension). Nonetheless, it is an amazing film; certainly Spielberg's finest to date.<br />The collection that comes with the DVD does not quite meet the films quality. What you will receive in the set is a picture disc of the soundtrack. The soundtrack is from John Williams, and perhaps one of his most moving scores I have heard from him. While he instills his usual thematic sound, the music in this film has a deeply personal emotion that is carried with it, along with Itzhak Perlman's violin solos. Truly beautiful music, however sad it may sound.<br />Along with the soundtrack is a senitype, which is a reproduction of one of the 35mm frames. I imagine they are the same pictures, one of the girl in the red coat walking along the streets. Its a nice photo, but why do I want it? What am I going to do with it?<br />Also is a small hardcover book of images from the film. A nice book as well, but with a book that shows photos of the movie, why  look at the book when you can just watch the movie? Very little in the making of the film.<br />Finally is a Certificate of Authenticity. Now this just tops the cake. I mean, a Certificate that says this is a real AND official collector's set, because if I did not get one of these, I was going to assume this was a bootleg of some sort. There is not even a printed autograph! It just brags about the film and tells you what the set offers, which, if you did not open the set to see what was in it, you could not read this little certificate to see what was in it. Completely stupid.<br />If that does not thrill you enough, then you will also get a little pamphlet that tells you about the SHOAH organization which you can send some money to support them. Ugh.<br />The DVD offers some extras. No commentary, no behind the scenes footage. Can't break that fourth wall, now!! Keep it real! But you will get stories of the real Schindler Jews who have survived. You will also learn about the SHOAH organization. Furthermore is a video on Schindler's life, which is probably the best extra on the disc. The DVD is two-sided which is another unfortunate aspect which takes me back to the laser-disc days when I had to flip the disc over to continue the film. That annoyws me that I have to do that.<br />The best part of the collection is the case, which is a plexiglass casing with the names of the list printed in gray. Its pretty cool. While all this stuff is held in a slip case, which does not hold it very well, the plexiglass case has some metal dowels to keep it all in place.<br />In all, a poor set and for the price, definately not worth it. If I had known it was going to be a disappointing set, I would have just saved my money and bought the movie only version.<br />The ratings are 5 stars for the movie, and 2 stars for the set, which culminates to about 3 stars overall. If you love the movie, get the movie, not this set.cate to see what was in it. Completely stupid. <br />If that does not thrill you enough, then you will also get a little pamphlet that tells you about the SHOAH organization which you can send some money to support them.

While all this stuff is held in a slip case, which does not hold it very well, the plexiglass case has some metal dowels to keep it all in place. <br />In all, a poor set and for the price, definately not worth it. If I had known it was going to be a disappointing set, I would have just saved my money and bought the movie only version. <br />The ratings are 5 stars for the movie, and 2 stars for the set, which culminates to about 3 stars overall. If you love the movie, get the movie, not this set.
0385336810|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; deals with Emma who works as a Marketing Assistant at Panther Cola and her encounter with a stranger on her flight back to London from Glasgow. Her plane encountered turbulence and Emma thought that it was going down and she was going to die. In her frightened state, she blurted out some of her darkest secrets to the good-looking guy sitting next to her. Some of her darkest secrets are the fact that she isn't sure if she has a G-spot, faking her Math grade on her CV, watering her co-worker's plant with orange juice, and that she thinks her boyfriend, Connor is a tad too boring for her. Suddenly, the plane landed and Emma thought that was it.<br />Until on Monday when she walked in to her office, and the stranger that she met on her flight turned out to be none other than Jack Harper, the CEO of Panther Cola. She was both terribly frightened (the fact she might get fired for lying on her CV) and embarassed. In fact, Jack was more terribly amused and taken by her. Soon, Emma began to feel attracted to Jack. <br />I really like &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; as it is such as fun and funny read. There are times when I literally laugh out loud. Like all her other &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series, this book is fast-paced and is able to engage its readers well. Her characters are well-developed and likeable. Kinsella is definitely one of the better chick-lit authors around. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun and relaxing read.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|haha.....whoever it was who wrote the review comparing the vocals of Corpsegrinder to jonathan davis....this just in: you're not a death metal fan.  go back to listening to creed.  I haven't even heard the album.....and most everyone else including diehard cc fans are giving it 5.  so i might as well.<br />blasting DOES go with this style of music b/c it is what DEFINES death metal.  death metal wasn't founded by some nancy-boy puddle of mudd-loving hippies with no original sound, it was made by REAL men.  no make-up.  just beer.  blasting.  more blasting.  brutal vocals.  insane music.  that is death metal.  if you have a problem with it.....feel free to write reviews to some pop music and leave it up to people who actually know what they're talking about.  go listen to country.
0393314804|5.0|I'm not sure what made me want to read this book in the first place, but I'm glad I did. The scottish slang and phonetically spelled dialogue made the characters really come alive. For a previously uncorrupted person I found this book delightfully enlightening. This book is not just for those who can relate to the lives of the characters! I am as far from Edinburg as possible, literally and figuratively, but I found this book extremely entertaining, funny and totally messed up. Definately worth a read, and many more.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|First off this cd rocks. I love their guitar beats and the drums are very fitting. Tracks like Are you gonna be my Girl?, Rollover DJ, and Cold Hard B*tch will stay in your head for days. <BR>     My only real complaint about this cd is that it gets real old fast. Especially Are you Gonna be My Girl? which also sounds like they copied the song Lust for Life by Iggy Pop in the sevendies. Regardless of this, this is an awesome album with great tunes and is well worth your money.
0446310786|5.0|Somehow I made it through high school AND college without being required to read this book.  I've heard nothing but good things about this book and thought I should go and pick it up.<br />I can see why people do nothing but rave about this book.  It is truly wonderful; a real work of art.  It is amazing that Harper Lee never wrote any other books.<br />This is the story of Jean Louise, known by her loved ones as Scout, and the experiences of her family and her home town of Maycomb, Alabama back in the 1960's when blacks were still largely oppressed by whites.<br />You fall in love with Scout, her brother Jem, her father Atticus, and most of the residents of Maycomb throughout the first half of the book.  Through the eyes of Scout, you really see how things used to be during that time.  Also, through the upbringing of her father, you begin to understand why some people do things that don't make much sense on the cover.  You learn to try and see things through there eyes before passing judgment.<br />However, in the second half of the book, judgment unfortunately come to Tom Robinson.  He is standing trial for raping a white girl and the events of the trial will unveil the true character of nearly everybody in Maycomb.  It is sad, but it is a real character piece.  While it is slowly paced, especially at the beginning during the characterization part of the book, it is still hard to put down.  The characters in this book become as alive and real as the people in your own town.<br />It is a book that will cause you to reflect on your own life, and how you treat those you meet.  It is a book that will make you realize the ugliness and terrible results of racism.  It is a book that every person should read whether forced to in school or not.  It is a book I will read time and time again.  It is a book I highly recommend.
B0000E64ZB|5.0|Carla blends lullaby-esque melodies, acoustic rhythm, and fast sonorous french lyrics to create an absolutely peaceful, catchy, brilliant album.  I definitely recommend it, even if you do not speak french!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I DOWNLOAD TOXIC PLUS I HAVE TOXIC ON MY NEW NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC VOLUME 15
B00004XONN|4.0|I find it hilarious that this album is so widely hailed for its originality. It's not the least bit progressive or groundbreaking<BR>or new or anything like it. But it is good. <BR>    Obviously Thom &amp; the guys have been listening to too many Delia Darbyshire recordings (not that that's a bad thing!) The influence of the BBC radiophonic workshop weighs heavily here although the Head fail to come up with anything near as good. People mention Eno and Low (Bowie) as touchstones for this album. I can understand why, but the record it reminds me of most is Simple Minds' lost masterpiece from 1979, 'Reel to Real Cacophony'. Only not as good.<BR>    The funny thing is how Radiohead are viewed in America as near visionaries. Even by people who should know better. At best they are a fine rock band with a whiney singer. At worst, self- indulgent music history students with very good taste. <BR>    Still, if this album makes people realize that there's a whole other dimension of music out there then I guess it serves its purpose. Unfortunately, I suspect most people never get any further than the relative safety of something like 'Kid A' and that really is a wasted opportunity.<BR>Four stars for effort.
B00005RG6B|1.0|Please tell me that the other 16 people that reviewed this actually saw it? What is with the over dramatic singer. Rolling on the ground. Everyone except the drummer over emphasize everything they do on stage. This is by far the worst DVD concert I have. If anyone else rolls on stage singing and acts like a [fool], please tell me before I by it. This DVD [is lousy]! By the way there are just as talented bands as this. They are a dime a dozen.
0066214122|4.0|The future of technology? A good question. Reading this book you will ask yourself, how far will we go to design machines that we cannot control. Though a very quick read, it is not as good as Andromeda Strain. But still will have you wanting to turn the page to see what happens. <br />Our hero in this book is an out of work computer programmer who specializes in animal swarm behavoir. He is now a stay at home dad. And his wife is working on a new start up company desiging nanotechnology devices. He starts to expect his wife is having an affair and accepts a consulting job at the facility where she has been spending most of her time. He finds a lot more going on than he every dreamed. A swarm of nano-sized devices that that have gotten out of control.<br />This time Crichton has nanotechnology go wild. He does a good job of explaining the difficult subject matter so that it makes the book more beliveable to those not familiar with the technology. <br />So if you have liked his other books. Pick it up, and take the thrill ride.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is what music is supposed to be. It makes me FEEL, a feat no other group has ever accomplished. I won't waste your time with song descriptions or praise, for it has been reviewed over a thousand times now on Amazon alone. Just buy it, it will change your life. &quot;One day, I am gonna grow wings...&quot;
B0000TLA9G|5.0|While other reviewers put down this Guns N' Roses collection for various reasons, I still felt since their biggest hits are included in this package (even if some are cover versions) and remastered I'm not complaining. I also picked this cd up at a local store for an extremely low price so I felt I got alot of music for the money! Hits such as &quot;Paradise City&quot;, &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;, &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot; (a Bob Dylan cover), &quot;Live And Let Die&quot; (a Paul McCartney And Wings cover), &quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; (a Rolling Stones cover) are here plus five more songs. The sound quality is excellent due to remastering and it's all put together in an attractive digipack. If you enjoy eighties rock such as Poison, Cinderella, Motley Crue and Dokken then you'll enjoy this collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show deserved to be a modern SciFi classic, up there with Babylon 5 and Farscape as a real alternative to Star Trek.  Firefly is an odd mixture of traditional spaceship show and a western all mixed in with bits of asian culture. (which was actually a nice touch I think).<br />That this show was put on air out of order, without even the pilot episode being shown till the *end* of the series was a tragedy.  When viewed in the right sequence, as shown in the box set, we have a wonderful and quite unique TV series with some great special effects thrown in.<br />I got to the last episode and swore at the TV because there was no more to watch and cursed the stupidity of TV executives. (again)<br />My only gripe with this box set of the show is that it is hard to find the episode commentries which are buried inside the &quot;language&quot; selection section for each episode.
B00003CX6P|5.0|I've seen this movie many times and by seeing one or two negative reviews had to write one for my own. This movie reminds of those old fashioned movies-you remember them-that used to feed your soul with beauty. The trumpets are depressing and the acting is intense. But anyone who loves that rush you get when you watch a great movie...this one is for you. You tend to not like Matt Damon towards the end of the movie, but his portrayal is real. The ones who should be praised here also include Jude Law and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Jude has that [attractiveness] and Phillip has the character. The music is to die for and the acting is real. For anyone who enjoys beautiful things...watch this movie...now.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Having travelled all over the USA to see Pink Floyd when they have been stateside in concert during their fabulous touring years, I was wild to get this DVD, particularly since I saw them LIVE in concert with &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; in the 70s during their amazing tour. It was the start of Pink Floyd becoming an unnparalled Icon.<br />This DVD stimulates memories of many a blazing night watching PF wind everyone up and blow us all away. It was great to see the original artists (including Roger) perform in clips from old films of the DSOTM concert plus see him 30 years later along with the elegantly spoken and awesomely gifted guitarist Dave Gilmore, keyboard guru Richard and thunder drummer Nick bandmates discussing their roles in the music creative process that transformed heavy-metal rock and roll into futuristic, crank it up to the max, even heavier-metal rock and roll with a sound signature like no other band then or since. Weird, Wild, Wonderful.<br />Any number of us PF maniacs can probably recall those outrageous tailgate parties that hammered us into a glorious haze before the concert. Afterwards, with ears ringing like gongs, we partied on and paraded around in Pink Floyd primo concert T- shirts with the tour dates listed on the back while listening to the latest PF release being blasted out of dozens of boom boxes as the night turned into dawn.<br />Those are the kinds of vibes that this DVD stirs up and I can tell you I loved every single minute of it.  A MUST have for your Pink Floyd ultimate collection.  It's spankin'!
0385504209|5.0|Breathtaking, thrilling, brilliant, original and thought provoking.  Mr. Brown's entire premise is interwoven with such precision and authenticity that when you turn the final page, whatever you thought you knew about Christ, the Bible, religion and history will be irrevocably changed for the good.<br />Olive Gallagher<br />Author of &quot;A Simple Path to The Good Life&quot;
B0000TAZBK|1.0|HELLO! about two weeks ago i ordered this wonderful cd (im sure ill love it but just havent recieved it yet) i love the music from the trilogy! The first time i ordered it, it was on free super save shipping. Then a day or two later i moved it up one step and increased the price by 7 bucks. TWO WEEKS LATER STILL no cd! and it hasnt even been shipped yet. I have ordered from amazon before and have had quick speedy delivery. BUT NEVER have i been so dissapointed in their customer service. This is even affecting future purchases from Amazon! EXTREAMLY DISSAPOINTED!!!! Did anyone else have this shipping problem!? And i am not rating the quality of the music, because that gets 5 stars! IM RATING AMAZON THEMSELVES! I AM VERY FRUSTRATED! I hope this dosent happen again in the future!!
0385504209|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying I've never read anything from Dan Brown before, and after reading this book, I'm very impressed... The book is very well written, the plot is excellent and the excitement keeps on building until a fantastic climax at the end. The book is full of exciting facts intermingled with fiction all throughout the book.<br />A man is murdered after hours at the Louvre museum in Paris. He's the chief curator of the museum, and he leaves behind clues as to why he was murdered and by whom, for his granddaughter, cryptologist Sophie Nevau, and Robert Langdon, a famous symbologist, to decipher. This unlikely couple ends up on the run from the French Police while searching for the killer or killers. They soon discover that the murder victim was a high-ranking member of a secret society that has been around since the time of Christ, and which have had prominent members such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Isaac Newton. This secret society has guarded one of mankind's greatest secrets for centuries - The Holy Grail.<br />I could talk about this for ages without really spoiling the story, since it is so complex, so full of twists and turns, and packed with intriguing facts about the history of the world and Christianity.<br />I can pretty much guarantee that you'll love this book. The book is excellent - a real page turner, and I literally couldn't put the book down until I was done. Without hesitation, I give it 5 stars!!!
B000003CUJ|5.0|Bought this CD 14 years ago when I was just out of high school.  I've listened to it probably about 500 times.  My favorite Wagner CD of all time, probably my favorite CD of all time.  Why?<br />There are so many CDs out there which are simply outtakes of parts of the Ring (like Twilight of the Gods and innumerable others).  This is the only one I know of where the conductor sought to spin a long, continuous tapestry of music spanning various parts of the complete opera from beginning to end, placing all the parts in the right order, making sure the end of one selection leads easily into the beginning of another.  It's quite a feat and I think Maazel pulled it off exactly right.<br />The musical interludes they've chosen are weaved together so well you'll have a hard time recognizing that they've just switched from, say, one Act to the next or even one opera to the next.<br />Anyone who, after buying it, is surprised there is no singing in this CD should have their head examined.  The title is \\"The Ring Without Words\\" for a reason, meaning there are no words.  It's pure music.  Occasional voice parts within the music have been replaced by an instrument.  Elitists and purists will scoff at the notion of changing Wagner's score, but I say so what?  The result is beautiful.<br />Words so often get in the way and start to crowd out the music, and Wagner's screeching sopranos are no exception.  That said, what could be better to the ear for one who doesn't like opera but loves Wagner's rich, powerful music than this?  A synthesis of the entire Ring Cycle compressed into a single CD.
0312995423|1.0|This book is a good &quot;airplane book&quot; .  You can read it from New york to LA and never miss anything.  There are many inaccuracies that a good Software Engineer can point out, but the one that bothered me most is that there are no stairs in the Giralda.  Did Dan Brown really spend time in Seville?
B000002LQR|5.0|In 1991, the Chili Peppers lived together over at Rick Rubin's mansion and recorded what would be their most talked about record. \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" is a kick [on the back] and a great way to spend this coming summer. Actually, I'd tie this with their latest \\"By The Way\\" as my favorite record. (Who says you can't love old AND new Chili Peppers?). When I hear this record, I hear 4 best friends, creating music because they love it and they love eachother.<br />\\"The Power of Equality\\" kicks open the album and it's all uphill from there. With this opening song the Chili Peppers show they have a social conscience and, with the LA riots happening around that same time, it makes this song even more powerful. This song, and most of the rest of the record, is funky and rocking at the same time. Flea and John Frusciante just gel together and it's great to hear. \\"If You Have To Ask\\", \\"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\\", \\"The Righteous And The Wicked\\", and \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" follow that same fusion of funk, rock, and Anthony Kiedis' well-phrased lyrics. Some of the lyrics, especially those on \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\", are explicit and there's a good reason for the Parental Advisory sticker...just letting you know, if you weren't already aware.<br />Moving on, you can't possibly forget the classic singles \\"Give It Away\\", the waltz \\"Breaking the Girl\\", the funk stomp \\"Suck My Kiss\\", and of course \\"Under The Bridge\\". No wonder this record is regarded as such a masterpiece. <br />I love this music and I love the guys in this band. There is something very moving about it all. Four best friends just loving life and creating music together is the coolest thing to see and to this day they're still creating music, which I feel, is still very much relevant and moving lyrically and musically. Anthony, John, Flea, and Chad just kick my butt and I think a lot of people will agree.<br />My personal top 5 favorites from this record are: \\"My Lovely Man\\" (moving tribute to Hillel Slovak), \\"The Greeting Song\\", \\"Breaking the Girl\\", \\"Give It Away\\", and \\"Funky Monks\\".<BR>If you haven't yet picked up this record and you're interested, please do...I think you'll be pleased.
B0000A118M|5.0|I would just like to say to all the one-star-ratings people, LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!<br />I too absolutely hated it when I first heard it and the second time and the third.  Then I realised what I was doing.  I was attempting to map what I already knew and had heard from the music I had grown up listening to onto this new kind of music and what happened?  I failed to grasp what was going on.<br />What's going on?<br />This is not music that fits neatly into any labelling or pigeonhole, this is music for the heart, the mind, the soul and the senses.  This is music coming from someplace so deep that it defies categorisation.  John Coltrane has tapped into the Essence, the Source from which all great things come.  It is not so much an album dedicated TO God but an album that is being channeled directly FROM God.  This is Manna from Heaven.<br />This is supreme musicianship at work.
1563890119|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I love the Sandman. I started on it by the last volume (the Wake), which wasn't the smartest thing to do, but heck I didn't know. Afterwards, puzzled, I proceeded to read the whole series more or less in order (depending on the stocks in my local comic store, mainly). If I hadn't had an idea of what the later story arcs would evolve into, I would have closed the first volume almost as soon as I opened it. Why? Because the wake was clearly fantasy. Whereas this is horror a la Clive Barker (and I can't stand horror).<BR>The story, briefly: a group of magicians attempt to capture Death, and snare her younger brother, Dream, instead. After many years in captivity, Dream manages to get free, and spends the rest of the book trying to rebuild his kingdom, which grew pretty ruined in the years he wasn't there.<BR>This is not for the faint-hearted. It is worth remembering that Mr Gaiman was writing a horror comic, rather than the fantasy, mythology-ladden stories the series would later evolve into. There are some fairly gruesome moments, with the necessary drawings. I would advise you to skip it altogether (with the possible exception of 'The Sound of Her Wings' which introduces the brilliant character of Death), except that you won't understand the later volumes if you do. So maybe flick through it, and through the next one, the Doll's House, which is somewhat messy and equally gruesome (except, again, for one particular section involving Hob Gadling, a man who strikes an odd bargain with Death). Don't let the gory bits deter you from Gaiman. Start the in-depth reading with volume three and read all of them to the Wake. Trust me, it's worth it.
0064471837|4.0|This book, the first of the series, is a VERY well written book. Garth Nix carefully weaves magic and reality to gether so cunningly that it's almost a reality into it's self! Garth Nix is a great author and full of tricks and twists its most definately a good read!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Every so often, a fresh artist explodes onto the rap scene, with an album that the whole world says brings absolute fire. Enter Kanye West and his critically acclaimed debut LP, The College Dropout. This album is not only packed with Kanye's explosive beats - yes, he produced his whole album - but is also one of the few albums in my extensive collection that is so lyrically sound. Indeed, The College Dropout is an album that you can listen straight through, from start to finish, and be captivated everytime. West brings us 21 tracks of pure magic, so I'll run down the cuts - <br />1. Intro - Different from other Intro's I've heard, but this one's really good. Set's off 'The College Dropout' theme. ( - )<br />2. We Don't Care - A really feel good cut, one that's so easy to listen to. A solid start to the album. (5/5)<br />3. Graduation Day - Another skit continuing the album theme.<BR>( - )<br />4. All Falls Down - Amazing, pure fire and such an amazing beat! This is the type of cut that's made Kanye's debut so popular. (5/5)<br />5. I'll Fly Away - Another skit in the form of the song. Slightly annoying after 'All Falls Down' brilliance, but it sets up the next track. ( - )<br />6. Speaceship - In the top three tracks of the album - such an amazin song to listen to when you're playing the album straight through. (5/5)<br />7. Jesus Walks - Another song in the top three tracks of the album. Such a diverse topic for an artist of Kanye's style, but his rhymes and wordplay on this cut makes a pure listenig pleasure. (5/5)<br />8. Never Let Me Down - Killer cut, except J. Ivy kinda brings down. An amazing track, but it falls short compared to the rest of the album. (4/5)<br />9. Get 'Em High - Cool song, but not a standout. I play it sometimes, but mainly for Common's parts. (4/5)<br />10. Workout Plan - Skit that leads us into the next song. ( - )<br />11. The New Workout Plan - Really good and different - proves what a lyricist Kanye is. (4.5/5)<br />12. Slow Jamz - Thecut that's put Twista's next LP (Kamikaze) on the map as well as showing the ladies Kanye's softer side. Really easy to listen to - one of the albums high points. (5/5)<br />13. Breathe In Breathe Out - I expected so much from this song, especially with Luda featuring, but it really fell short. Worst song on the album - the only down point. (3.5/5)<br />14. School Spirit 1 - Another skit that continues The College Dropout theme. ( - )<br />15. School Spirit - Amazing, amazing, amazing. Addictive chorus, tight verses and beat - Kanye's genius shines on this track. (5/5)<br />16. School Spirit 2 - Skit that rounds off the last three cuts. ( - )<br />17. Lil Jimmy Skit - Sets off the final part of the album ( - )<br />18. Two Words - Really good, such a good production job from Kanye with two good features: Mos Def &amp; Freeway (5/5)<br />19. Through The Wire - The standout track of the album. Everyone's heard it, it's hard to describe how amazing it is - I listened to this for days straight when I copped the disc. (5/5)<br />20. Family Business - So good, so uplifting and some really good keyboard pieces on Kanye's beat. (5/5)<br />21. Last Call - The perfect roundoff track to complete an amazing album. It clocks in at about 13 minutes, with the last 10 being about how Kanye got his deal with the Roc, etc, etc. Really good. (5/5)<br />I really suggest everyone buys this album if they haven't already. Kanye West is one of rap's future stars, in both his wordplay and his beats. I love hearing new material he's produced and I can't wait for his follow up LP. This is set to be one of 2004's top rap albums, proving that Kanye West is the future. Roc-A-Fella has recently suffered the retirement of Jay Z, and eveyone's eyes are on State Property, The Diplomats, YoungGunz and Kanye West to keep the label going.<br />&quot;Tragedy To Triumph&quot; Kanye said - he could hold the down on his own. Rap album of the momment. Cop it.<br />5 stars - pure classic.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have to say that Enya's music is simply beautiful. Haunting, ethereal. In this album, the tracks are mainly in English with one Latin and one Gaelic track. Others are musical. My favourite tracks on this album are (without a doubt) only time and one by one. I loved silver inches and wild child too. In fact, you could say that I loved all the tracks. For those who has never listened to Enya's music, listen to her music for a change.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|And I've seen just about ALL of them!  Highly entertaining, and with a new twist on the usual vampire theme, this movie was great!  I was so excited when I learned there was going to be a Blade II.  Just when you think that you can't stand to see another vampire movie for lack of a fresh approach, along comes Blade II.  Move over Van Helsing, 'cause Blade (Wesley Snipes) is da man.  The special effects were wonderful, and the new 'monsters', without giving it all away, were scary as hell.  This is a must-have for your video collection.<br />I loved this movie!  Scary fun indeed!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|For a good time, make it Lost in Translation time. This movie is quite good, and is most of all, different from all of the other movies that have come out this year. <BR> Writing the plot would be useless, as you can interpret it any way you want to. Sofia Coppola is obviously more gifted in directing than she is in acting, (see GODFATHER 3 bleacch.) and won the oscar for best original screenplay.<BR> I sincerely liked this movie and the characters in it, you can just watch this movie and fall asleep with your eyes open, transfixed on the tube. <BR> The bonus features really could have been a little more extensive, but they were okay, including interviews between Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola, amongst others.<BR> If you want to see the world from a different perspective for 120 minutes, rent or buy Lost in Translation, you'll be glad you did.
B000002P6R|5.0|This is one of the Who albums many people believe shouldn't have been made.  It's true most of the songs on Face Dances lack energy, especially compared to their early 70's records.  But I can't help but think the songs on Face Dances are some of the Who's most well-written and memorable collection of songs.      Hearing Face Dances for the first time you can tell that, by this point in their career, the Who seem really exhausted.  The songs that DO have energy feel more like the members of the Who are forcing themselves to rock out, to keep up with the times.  The harder rocking songs just don't sound very convincing.  However, I don't think the Who lost a step at all in terms of writing excellent music.    I think all the songs are good (and I mean all of them!)  I have a lot of memories connected to all the songs, especially \\"You Better You Bet\\".  Memories of when I was only a small child barely able to talk, and hearing that song on the radio as my mother drove to Delaware to do some shopping.  I feel like I'm back in the mid-80's whenever that song comes on.  The rest of the songs happen to give me the same memories even though I've never heard most of them until five years ago.    But I think all the songs are excellent.  Even \\"Another Tricky Day\\" which is most people's second favorite song (behind \\"You Better You Bet\\").  For the longest time I couldn't get into \\"Another Tricky Day\\" but now I think I finally hear what everyone loves about it.  Okay maybe people don't LOVE it.      There are some moments that especially interest me such as in \\"How Can You Do It Alone\\" when the melody switches in another direction and the line \\"I need your help, so I can do it by myself\\" comes in.  Man that's great!  I'm not sure what the lyrics are about, but that's a very good unexpected melody.  The rest of the song is great too.      The rockers are all winners such as \\"Cache Cache\\", \\"The Quiet One\\", and \\"You\\".  And even if a song on Face Dances doesn't rock very hard, you can count on hearing great songwriting to make sure the song is a keeper.  \\"Did You Steal My Money\\" has cool vocals similar to something the Police would do and \\"Daily Records\\" is yet another enjoyable song which very much sounds like the classic Who of the early 70's.      The bonus tracks are mostly okay except for \\"Is It In You\\" which doesn't do enough to keep me interested, but \\"I Like Nightmares\\" is extremely good.  That song is nothing but one big melody!  The two live tracks at the end are pretty weak though, but nothing bad.      It's a breath of fresh air to hear a hard rock band from the 60's and 70's release an 80's album that doesn't sound generic and predictable (I'm looking at you Aerosmith, Rainbow and Deep Purple).  I wouldn't put this album ahead of Tommy, Quadrophenia, or Who Are You but it's my fourth favorite Who album.  Give it a chance.
0385510438|3.0|For one hundred and seventy four pages I was captivated by Grisham's uncanny ability to once again unfold a masterful story revolving very subtly around a gruesome rape and murder, but revolving not so subtly around a southern town, its people, its shortcomings, and its peacefulness. <BR>When Part Two of the book began, I felt like I was reading a different novel.  Were it not for the sneaking suspicion that something &quot;big&quot; was forthcoming, I would have not completed the novel.  For approximately 100 pages, Grisham wanders in his writing, and there seems to be very little tying the stories together.  I was astounded, as this is not the Grisham I am used to.  <BR>Although the storytelling is superb, the story itself leaves much to be desired.  Grisham fans will truly enjoy the growth in Grisham's writing, and will see a writer who continues to evolve as a story-teller, and an author.  If this is your first jaunt into Grisham, I would suggest one of his earlier books.
078401213X|1.0|It's good for the first 20 minutes but it then falls apart, and the movie has another hour to go! The idea is simple enough: a mathematician trying to find the formula to explain the pattern of life. Certain groups are after him but that's all of the story that makes sense. The last half has the guy poking imaginary brains, and he discovers he's got something in his own head. An alien implant perhaps? This script should have gone through the printer a couple of more times before it was made into this failure. Too bad, it had potential.
B00003CWTI|1.0|I highly disliked this movie and rather begrudge PT Anderson for making something so bad for me to sit through. The movie is absolutely bursting with &quot;artistic&quot; elements, but overall they do more to obscure the main themes than they do to clarify them.  Furthermore, there does not there seem to be any reason for them to be in the movie other than the intellectual self-gratification of the movie's creators.  I found no sympathy with the main characters, who, for the most part, spent the movie wallowing in self-pity only to have all their problems solved by a contrived and completely nonsensical ending.
B00005JLZN|4.0|The only people who hate this movie are anti-death penalty activists because it makes them look like fools. The movie itself had me glued to the screen all the way. Just go see it, it's that good.
B000002U82|5.0|Once in a while, a rock band or other musical entity puts out an album that, quite simply, changes the face of music history. And yet, Pink Floyd was a rather unlikely group of musical innovators: An excellent singer/guitarist(David Gilmour) who was, until the release of this album, best known merely as &quot;Syd Barrett's replacement,&quot; (Barrett, still regarded by many fans as the band's true musical genius, had recently taken leave of his senses and was apparently holed up somewhere watching the floor relate to the walls); a fine bassist/writer/singer/perfectionist (Roger Waters) still tortured by his fatherless upbringing; a low-key keyboardist and rather good singer and writer (Rick Wright) who stayed in the background as much as possible; and finally, a rather thoughtful percussionist and sound-effects wizard (Nick Mason), whose most lasting claim to fame would be as the man who vocalized the chilling spoken word threat in the band's classic &quot;One Of These Days&quot;. An unlikely band of innovators, to be sure. And yet, Pink Floyd was properly positioned in the right place at the right time with the right sound. The year was 1973, the musical revolution started in the sixties was still in full swing, FM radio was in it's infancy (Recently taken over by hippie-types who longed for hours and hours of nice, spacy, commercial-free programming). In a word, rock music was the touchstone of our generation, just as television had been the touchstone of our parent's generation, and computers would be to our childen's generation. Those of us in high school or college spent hours every night and weekend, gathered around the stereo in someone's apartment or room, getting high, drunk, or just daydreaming, pondering such important questions as &quot;What makes Teflon stick to the pan?&quot; (Thank you, Gallagher!) In many of these listening spaces, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon was the album of choice, sometimes listened to over and over again. The mad mutterings of &quot;Speak to Me,&quot; the celestial swirl of &quot;Breathe&quot;, the jet-propulsive paranoia of &quot;On the Run,&quot; and &quot;Time,&quot; a favorite subject of young questers everywhere (along with madness, death, and pizza), &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; (with Claire Torry's incredible vocal-cries of universal anguish, &quot;Money&quot;, first-rate blues rock, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, hypnotic yet thought-provoking, &quot;Any Colour You Like,&quot; sheer beauty, &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, the madman inside all of us, and &quot;Eclipse,&quot; the perfect thematic coda. All received by us, the grateful listeners, in our various states of consciousness (altered or otherwise), and then purchased, time and again, from music stores. Dark Side of the Moon was the ONE ALBUM that every rock fan (and many wouldn't otherwise be caught dead listening to rock music) had to own. Why??? After thirty years, I can offer only a tentative answer: Most people cannot stand to ruminate for long about ourselves and our place in the universe, yet every human being on the face of this earth will at sometime wonder: Why are we here??? The Pink Floyd, through this classic masterwork, holds no answers for us, yet it is as if they are offering to accompany us as we journey toward self-discovery, making the transition easier, soothing the pain, quieting the hurt even as they force us to see inside ourselves. Thanks, guys, from all of your fellow voyagers. I think I can safely speak for many when I say the road to self-awareness would have been much bumpier if I had not traveled it in your celestial vehicle. I say once, and I say again, SHINE ON, YOU CRAZY DIAMONDS and rock on, even unto the darkest part of the dark side of the moon.
B000002UUX|5.0|This album is hands down, one of the greatest, not only thrash, but one of the greatest metal albums ever. From start to finish, you get sonically assulted by Dave Mustaine and co. Co-guitarist Marty Friedman's firey solos and Dave Mustaine's finger-twisting riffs, paired with David Ellefson's thrashing bass lines and Nick Menza's thunderous drumming make this, quite possibly, Megadeth's best album, although It's a tough match between this one and \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" Here's my song by song synopsis:<BR>1.

B00004Z459|5.0|Oh boy......this album rocks....I just saw a show on MTV called the 22 greatest cds of the past 20 years, and if I can recall through the smoke......oh yes, they were number ten!...Buy this album and enjoy.....All tracks rip
B000002J1M|5.0|As said in most of the other reviews, while the production may seem shaky at times, it is made up for with the sheer musical brilliance put forth in every aspect of the music found on &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. The album keeps you listening from start to finish, with the powerful opener &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; to the 23 minute epic, &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;. Every piece found here is fantastic, and extremely accessible.<br />If you're a fan of Genesis, then you surely already own &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. If you're just starting out however, it's a great place to begin. Give this one a chance, you won't be let down.<br />Standout tracks: &quot;Get 'Em Out By Friday&quot;, &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;
B000089RVX|3.0|First off, there seems to be nothing genuine or dynamic in revelation concerning the tormented pathos of Amy Lee. The dark goth/troubador stylings are a lot of glistening sequin as opposed to the blunt reality of Patty Smith or Kurt Cobain. The cliches abound on this disc, from riotous manic-frenzy in their biggest radio hit yet(&quot;Bring me to Life&quot;) to the trip-hop atmospherics that cut loose in the more calmer moments(&quot;My Immortal&quot;).The songwriting has not only not much in the ingenuity department, they're also selling what Lacuna Coil and Tool fans arn't buying. Why 3 stars? I give it the merit of 3 stars because while not wholly novel in originality or by design, there is kinetic rumblings of power in the album, by marked way of Amy Lee's impressive vocals(which remind me of a female Maynard James Keenan counterpart) and the counterbalance of Ben Moody's guitar sludge(good player, if not interesting). In theory, this band has sold out big time, will yet sell out big time, and will sell out some more. But, by way of disenfranchised teens with inky eyeliner bent of embracing recycled goth-pop that can't touch Bauhaus within a tri-county radius, we, dear listener, will see Evanescence have a bright tommorow on the charts. And, there could be worse things.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a flawless album from the first note of &quot;airbag&quot; to the last note of the &quot;tourist&quot;.
B00004Z400|4.0|I actually give this record 4.5 stars...<BR>  This is a grossly underrated album. The craft and bleeding heart aggro-pathos of Chino and crew cut like a hot knife in butter(sad cliche, I know) and leave the listener with the strong sensation of having survived a night in the heart of Vietnam or something. The emotional assualt is the real killer: Chino's passionate delivery is like a strangling cry in the night, one that wakes the dead and your unfortunate neighbors(have done it in real life, though dead did not actually awaken from their abode, but cranky neighbors did) when played at full decibel in perfect stereophonics. Some of the more mellow tracks, such as &quot;Teenagr&quot;, &quot;Digital Bath&quot; and the closing number, afford the emotional connection to the listener without fabrication and stagnation. These moments, along with first rate production (thanks to Terry Date) bring to life a strong and unique presence under the californian musical sun. I havn't listened to the first 2 records by Deftones, and to be honest, I probably wouldn't want to. The fact that this CD alienated a lot of people in it's bold full speed ahead strident swagger, is proof to me that they pulled a Radiohead(albeit, one more convincingly then the aforementioned) and cut their lossess with die hard fans to find a new niche in their craft, and in the process, came out with a weighty, heady, and slightly disturbing alt-art-rock masterpeice. Though sorely underestimated, &quot;White Pony&quot; throughs around more then it's weight, and for that, I applaud the Deftones for bringing originality, passion and art back to nu-metal, or whatever you kids call it. Through and through, a great record with virtually no weak moments. Highly reccomended.

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I have not been a kind friend to Tool. I never thought of much of Tool, the same way in which I'm alienated from &quot;Dave Matthews Band&quot;. My problem, albeit a common one, is the overextended effort of style over substance. The dirge like majesty of Tool's over-the-top moments had acrid bite and the only reedeeming flavor was in the prowess of the instrumentation and Maynard James Keenan's vocals. So, after listening to &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, I came away ALMOST a fan of the band, but not quite a believer. Why? Some filler, less dynamic arrangments and less melodic sensiblities. Is it a good album? It is and it shoulders above many of its contemporairies, but falls flat of &quot;System of a Down&quot;, or even &quot;Deftones&quot;(and I mean these in band name only, not self-titled releases)because of it's myopic and lackluster dimensions. Billy Howerdel is probably frustrated that his significant contribution to his own band is overshadowed by the pathology and enigmatic personality of Maynard James Keenan(who I think is fairly malajusted, and not in an artistic way like Kurt Cobain, but in a more disturbing and off-the-wall sense like Marilyn Manson, or Michael Jackson)but it doesn't seem to overtly surface, and the theatrical flourishes of his own production gifts take center stage to bring out the subtlety of the album(I personally think that Flood and Alan Moulder could do wonders with the band). I just wish that they would find more of a driving dimension to their objective.While not a great album, and one that I, admittedly, found dissapointment with, its still a solid 3 star review and one hopes that the band imminently comes full circle by crafting a more self-assured and significant next effort. That would be a more worthwhile venture then this slight misstep.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie moves at a snail pace but it still has its funny moments. Definitely a rent first movie..unless you are a diehard Bill Murray fan, of course.
B000062YAZ|4.0|Instrumenation hits the over-drive button with a new and daring sonic twist in this blaring, full-throttle blistering set. The only problem is the tell-tale marks of ignorance in the lyrics in which Jesus is the scapegoat for their personal woes and societal injustices.funnything is, I thought that SATAN was the one who came to \\"steal, kill and destroy\\" ?While they are obviously not well grounded or versed in their doctrine, they nonetheless are skilled with music virtuosity, and the production effort from the supremely gifted Rick Rubin, enables the final mix to superscede previous death metal outings, from \\"Slayer\\" themselves, to their scores of inferior copy-cats.Brutal, but creative and sonically rewarding.Very good, but a mute button for the vocals would be nice.
0385504209|5.0|It's been years since I encounter a book which I simply can't put down... until my father in law surprised me with this gem.

B000069CWE|4.0|In short, this is one of my favorite remix albums. Linkin Park has taken their record-setting debut album and attacked the tracks with computer-produced additives that transported Hybrid Theory to the matrix and back. I'm very pleased with the overall quality, and it's rare for me to approve of an entire compilation of makeovers, especially for not even being a big fan of the usual Linkin Park.<br />Reanimation stays inventive, upbeat and just plain cool, considering that you don't take it too seriously and are wanting some electric beats. I've played this in the car, during workouts - any time I was primarily focusing on something else but wanted good music. It seems to be one of the best soundtracks for my environment.
0446677450|5.0|This is a great book. It has tought me so many things about how how to save my money and what to do when i have enough to spend it. When i am older i plan to put this information to use and be rich and retire early just like kiyosaki. I think that everyone should read this book if they are intrested in money, and how to become rich.
B000060MMI|5.0|When I got dragged to the Van's Warped Tour a few years ago and suffered under the hot, hot sun while several stages had various commercialized-punk artists jamming, Flogging Molly was the only good 30 minutes from the entire afternoon.<br />I was thirsty. I was getting shoved. I was tired of the sorry exploitation of the safety pin and mohawk. But then this band comes on, with members who DIDN'T look like children, and they had funny instruments and were wearing green. Immediately, you could tell that this was a special variety of punk music. The music was instantly catchy and fun - a nice break from &quot;I hate my dad&quot; sounds coming from every other stage. I liked it!<br />This album is a tasteful, clumbsy romp through patriotism, heartache, and brotherhood. It's also the clearest, best example of the bagpipe-slash-guitars sound that has been previously done by bands such as the Dropkick Murphies. If you're looking for Irish rock with a popular punk-style twist, check it out.
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel in 8th grade and absolutely loved it.  Since then I've had to buy two more copies because mine fell apart from reading them so often.  Now that I'm a senior in H.S. I still read the trilogy over and over again.<br />Nix ensares his readers with fantasy that reads like realism.  His descriptive style compels us to want to know what happens next though we've read it a dozen times plus a few. The magic in this book, and the imagination, as well as the danger and fear make this book seem like gold.  Beautiful, valuable, and rare.<br />It's a book that every person should add to his/her collection, young or old.
B000002BBY|3.0|This album was a must-have for me, because the singles were circulating when I was a teenager and just beginning to pay attention to rock stations that excluded pop songs. Oasis' sound consists of spacey guitars, thick British accent and the familiar hits \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Champaign Supernova\\" and the sentimental \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\", which is commonly mistaken as a Lennon piece for its piano and perhaps the line \\"So I'll start a revolution from my bed.\\"<br />While I don't listen to this album in its entirety or find the hitless tracks to be very memorable, I do reach for this disc regularly to hear the songs from that alternative time of 1995. It's a keeper, and I recommend it to those who have already sampled the tracks and are looking to add this band to their collection, because you get every one of their popular releases on the CD. It's the best alternative to downloading the individual nuggets of gold.
0802130208|5.0|Although I managed to get through the majority of this book without certain knowledge to the &quot;point&quot; of it, I have to admit I've never laughed so hard. Ignatius, a sarcastic, overweight, and obnoxious man who still lives with his mother, is one of those characters that gave me a reason to read on. I found myself constantly questioning his true intelligence level and I still have my doubts toward the conclusion I arrived at. <BR>     I want to avoid at all costs, spoiling any part of the book, simply because its plot is so small that spoiling one part would leave you knowing the ending.       <BR>     This is one of those books that you have to remember you are reading for mere enjoyment. You will probably not learn anything new (except perhaps a snappy comeback that you will probably never use). You will probably not benefit in any way, form, or fashion, unless you believe that laughter is the best medicine (which it is). And most of all, you will not be raised on any sort of pedestal for completing another great book of our time. If one were to read this, they should be prepared to laugh and (gasp!) actually enjoy what they are reading. One should not dive into this book, much like its forbidden to dive into the shallow end of a pool. Overall method? Simply take it page by page, savor its wit, and allow yourself to become thoroughly entangled in the life of someone else.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|My first view of the movie had me just a tad disappointed it wasnt better(considering all the buzz). Dont get me wrong it overall is a very good movie and much better after the 2nd or 3rd viewing. If I had seen this movie pre buzz I would have thought it to be one of the best and original movies I had ever seen. I just went into theatre expecting to see a more than oscar worthy movie at the very least. I still bought the DVD anyway because I love to go back and see certain parts of the movie that will always be &quot;classic&quot; like Bill Murrays karaoke performance and the scene where he goes on that Japanese talk show......totally hilarious!

B000067IZ3|5.0|This film is truly a team film, because it does not have any true lead. All actors are supporting each other.<BR>Benicio Del Toro, you are a great actor and your character takes  time for his choices and has the biggest depth. In every true sense this role is supporting almost to the extent of being the backbone of the movie; Michael's,character has a few amazing scene and Don's character has this big, big finale of the movie after planting the last bug. <br />Criticsm:<BR>The film takes a moment to take off with storylines complex interwoven, as complex as all of the dealing with not only the drug wars, but wars as such.<BR>Soderbergh gives big moments to actors. <br />However, I felt that Catherine's character's biggest scene was cut, and should not have been cut, because she was giving birth to her choice. After finishing watching the movie I felt that Chaterine's character made the decision too quickly to turn criminal, the inner conflict was missing. How upset I was when I found the scene as Scene 9 from the Deleted Scenes in the Extra Features of the DVD. It was there, well filmed, brief and strong and probably taken away because the team did not want to victimize anyone into being a criminal.
0790732521|1.0|Set just after the 1916 Easter Rebellion in Dublin, Neil Jordan's film follows the life and times of Irish revolutionary Michael Collins (Liam Neeson), detailing his relationships with Kitty Kearnan (Julia Roberts), Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn), and Eamon de Valera (Alan Rickman).  It essentially covers the period leading up to the Civil War in Ireland, and ultimately Collins' untimely death.<BR>It must be said the movie proves to be an opportunity missed, considering the budget and all involved.  While it is usual for historical epics to have inaccuracies, &quot;Michael Collins&quot; is rather a disaster. After a very self conscious opening scene, the film seems to loose it's way and trods a distinctly uneven and incomprehensible path.  It tries to hard to be all things: epic war film, romantic movie, and politically descisive.  It fails on all counts, essentially because it is biased towards one side of the argument, and ridicules the other.  The script seems to make no attempt at exploring the intricacies of the politics involved which led to Civil War, and the picture ends up like something a not very knowledgable schoolboy would write in primary school.  Despite Liam Neeson's historonics, the casting in disasterous - particulary Aidan Quinn as an americanised Harry Boland, and Julia Roberts resembling a cross between Maureen O'Hara and Tinkerbell.  What ultimately comes across from the acting is a cast who just want to pick up their pay check as quickly as possible and move as swiftly as they can onto their next, more serious, production.<BR>The film is particulary offensive to those brave men and women who would not accept half measures, and took the view that the Anglo Irish Treaty was not the Republic of Easter Week 1916.  Certain historical figures are missing, especially Arthur Griffith and Cathal Brugha (although Gerard McSorely appears in a brief scene with a &quot;mcsorely&quot; wig on his head which looks like something one would find in the middle of acow field.<br />The Boland familly in general were outraged by the production, and the film did extremely well in Ireland, but flopped like a pan cake outside our four green fields.<BR>It also suffers from the tendency to point to the indigenous population saying &quot;Isn't this cool, we're all so important on this production.  Yes I played such and such in the movie&quot;.  I myself turned down any part of it with utter contempt, as I have taken the view that regardless of what side one was on during the Civil War, all concerned were heroes with no villins.  Was Robert E. Lee any less in greatness then Grant?  Both men are held with equal respect by the American populace.<BR>RTE produced a much rounded and interesting production &quot;The Treaty&quot; which deals with the period in a more mature, intelligent way.  The great Brendan Gleason appears as Collins, and the equally excellent Barry McGovern as de Valera.<BR>&quot;Michael Collins&quot; is a total fiasco and an embarrasement
156898443X|5.0|Everyday Matters is such a special, intimate, lovely book, it's hard to know where to begin singing its praises.  To open the book is to steal a look inside the sketchbook (a.k.a. the heart and mind) of a man who has just realized that drawing might help him see everything more clearly -- including seeing his way into a whole new life, one in which his wife is in a wheelchair.  And that man happens to live in and draw pictures of New York City, which he adores.  <br />Besides the delights of Gregory's words and images -- which are sometimes funny, and other times poignant -- the book also serves as a nearly overwhelming incentive to pick up a pen and draw. And by drawing, to see objects again for the first time.  If by publishing the book Gregory wished to remind people to look at the world around them with fresh, hungry, sensitive hearts and eyes, he has succeeded with this reader.
B000089CJI|5.0|First off, I would like to acknowledge that this is an album for everyone. My brother, sister, and I have never had the same taste in music, yet we all enjoy this CD. Also, my friends and my friends' parents like The Postal Service, too. The unique melodies are upbeat and happy in a sense. Personally the songs relate a lot to me and the minute I hear the music my mood becomes more positive. Their clever lyrics relate to almost anyone.      My favorites would have to include:   The District Sleeps Alone Tonight   Sleeping In   Such Great Heights   Nothing Better
B00005NRO3|4.0|At the time of it's release a lot people I know didn't like it at all. I have no idea why either. The lines are funny, the cast good and it even has it's scary moments. I have no idea why they did part 3 without Kevin Williamson doing the screen-play. His scripts made the movies clever, funny and down to earth. Plus the cast in part 3 is laughable compared to the telented cast in 1 and 2. I mean in this one you got David Arquette &quot;in no doubt his best role&quot;, Neve Campbell &quot;in possibly her best role as well&quot;, Courtney Coxx, Liev Shrieber, Jamie Kennedy, Jada Pinkett Smith, Timothy Olyphant  &quot;Go!&quot;, Jerry O'Connell, Omar Epps and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Oh and Roseanne's sister from...Roseanne is in it too.  Also look for Joshua Jacksan &quot;Dawson's Creak&quot; in a small role as a film class student.<br />  Anyway this movie is a  lot of fun and entertaining. Some things don't work of course though. Like how they use Han Zimmer's score from Broken Arrow whenever they show Dewey. Jerry Connell &quot;singing I think I love you&quot; to Sydney. Things that make it clever though for example, is when it pokes fun at other movies and even at itself. I like how Timothy Olyphant trys to come up with sequels that out-due the originals to Jamie Kennedy's character. It discusses sequels when it itself is one...trying to out-due the original and in some ways it does.
6300214184|5.0|The film is an image of what the 1980s were, of Pittsburgh in the 1980s, this temple of heavy industry coming to an end and starting to look for a new future, due to its industrial crisis. Yet this film has not lost any charm and meaning. The young Alex, an 18 year old girl, is the symbol of this city, an industrial worker during the day and a dancer at night, with a dream : to join the ballet company of the city. Industry producing art. Industrial work producing the dream of art. Alex is a willful young woman who follows the road of her desire, if not ambition, but keeping her ethics pure all along. Pure by looking for love and not pure pleasure. Pure by refusing any favor in her quest and longing for a victory that can be called her own because it owes nothing to anyone and any help from outside herself. Pure because she salvages her friend from becoming a gogo girl in a shady place where dancing is just some kind of dressing for enticing prostitution. Pure because she finds her energy in an old friendship with an old dancer who is encouraging her in getting started and competing for an audition that could open the door to a new artistic life. Pure because she is not soiled by all those who would like to drag her down into the mud of selling her young beauty and art to the gloating eyes of perverse and lustful males. And she can succeed because she never lets her dream die. In life the dream is the almighty sign on the road to epiphany and Alex will meet with this epiphany of hers, the one she has dreamed of for years and she can find only in the energy that comes from her mind and her body, from her unconquerable soul. This film has not aged in spite of all the changes that have occurred in our societies. The dream is the energizing force that leads the way, too often of some Cross, to transcendency.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0671449028|5.0|I have 3 boys and they have all loved this book.  Admittedly I ham it up a bit reading it...like when it say \\"with soap all over scrub, scrub, scrub\\" I rub their heads and they giggle uncontrollably.  But even with a silly mom, a book is not enjoyable if it's not well written and this one is awesome.  I think it's my favorite of her books and I love them all.  The words are very lyrical and so memorization is pretty easy for a 2 or 3 year old...which they LOVE!!!!
B000089CKH|5.0|With all the crappy uninspired teenage relationship simple plan garbage that continues to brainwash our youth today, there is hope yet. Nada Surf is simply put one of the greatest and soulful bands in the underground scene. They deserve success, they can upstage all the &quot;bands&quot; that are overplayed on the embarrassing MTV network. Give this album a chance and see for yourself what I mean when I say there is hope yet...
B000002GQL|5.0|By the time the Moody Blues had released their seventh album in five years, 1972's &quot;Seventh Sojourn,&quot; the band were absolutely exhausted, both personally and creatively. After the tour for the album was finished the following year, the Moodies took an extended five-year break before reuniting for 1978's &quot;Octave.&quot; But before the temporary stop in activity, the Moodies summoned up what creative energy they had left and put it into this wonderful, classic album. You'd never guess that the band were feeling any stress whatsoever, because &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot; is simply brilliant, one of the Moodies' very best works. Song for song it is a stunner. Keyboardist Mike Pinder contributes two of his most haunting Moody Blues songs ever, &quot;Lost In A Lost World&quot; and &quot;When You're A Free Man.&quot; The trio from guitarist Justin Hayward are all winners: the gorgeous &quot;New Horizons,&quot; the bouncy &quot;You And Me,&quot; and the charming &quot;Land Of Make-Believe.&quot; Bassist John Lodge gets the honor of penning the two classic singles from the album, the dramatic ballad &quot;Isn't Life Strange,&quot; and the awesome rocker &quot;I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band).&quot; And flautist Ray Thomas contributes one of his all-time greatest numbers, the lovely &quot;For My Lady.&quot; Only drummer Graeme Edge passed on writing any songs for the album, but he more than makes up for that with some of the most powerful drumming he ever laid down with the group.Having toured relentlessly, and having created in a short five years an impressive catalogue of albums known by many fans the world over as &quot;The Classic Seven&quot;---and, with &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot; becoming a #1 smash on the U.S. album chart---the Moody Blues had definitely earned their extended holiday as a recording act. Thank goodness that they returned to duty in 1978 and have been active ever since, but they couldn't have made a better album to rest on than &quot;Seventh Sojourn.&quot; It's a glorious Moody Blues album, one of the group's finest achievements. If you gotta go out---even if it's only temporarily---than go out on top. The Moody Blues ended the first phase of their work together *definitely* at the top of the mountain with &quot;Seventh Sojourn.&quot;
B000001DWG|5.0|I love this CD. I would reccommend this CD and ALL Mother Love Bone CD`s to anyone who is into Pearl Jam, Alice in chains, Jerry Cantrell, Malfunkshun, Mudhoney. This is an EXCELLENT piece of work. My favorite tracks are &quot;This is Shangrila&quot;, &quot;Come bite the apple&quot; and &quot;Capricorn sister&quot;. Although I love every track. &quot;Man of golden words&quot; is hard to listen to because of the words &quot;...sometimes I`m living in the temple of the dog&quot;, which later became the title of a tribute album for Andrew Wood after his death. EXCELLENT CD.
B000001Y5J|4.0|What Trent screams for in the Broken hit, Wish, foreshadows exactly what this cd has to offer. At first (having heard The Fragile first) i was sceptical about the wall of sound offered by Broken, even the title is kinda scary. But Broken is merely a loud plea for help, and an outburst against society.<br />Broken is not nin's best album, as it is only an EP, but what is delivered is great. Hard rock with an industrial twist, broken is a great anthem for the downtrodden, depressed, constrained, and angry. It vents emotion like no other cd, letting out what we deny as raw, human emotion.<br />From the power intro of Pinion all the way to song 99, Suck, every beat is felt. Even the silence is great, as (Youre So)Physical is almost like a break from the rest of the songs. A great cd of pain and angst, worth anyones time<br />(as said by others, avoid the Happiness in Slavery video, as well as the 20 minute Broken video/movie, thats some sick s***)
B000069AUI|4.0|I liked this album, but if you're looking for good Coldplay material, I suggest you get 'Coldplay Live 2003'. They play basically all the songs worth hearing, and the energy they have on stage makes their music way more entertaining. As for this album...<br />The best songs on this album are 'Politik' (although it only gets really good about 3 minutes in), 'In My Place', 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face', 'The Scientist', 'Daylight', 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head', and 'Amsterdam' (which remains my favorite song to date). 'Clocks' was good for awhile, but in my opinion it gets old way too fast. Overall, it's a good album I'd recommend...<br />Oh and a note to &quot;a music fan from USA&quot;, the song 'Clocks' is about death, not self pity. Looks like they had so much meaning in that song it went straight over your head.
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham divides his latest novel about a young man's venture in newpaper publishing into three parts.  Part One evokes \\"The Rainmaker\\" in the way he presents 23-year old Willie Traynor entering a new profession and coming up against danger and challenges that demonstrate his appealing humanity, intelligence and calm drive.<br /><br />  Shortly after this college dropout starts operating his new paper in his adopted Mississippi town, he's reporting on a lurid capital murder case complicated with a bought sheriff, a powerful criminal family, and a system corrupted by greed and fear.<br /><br /> Willie develops a tight bond with Callie Ruffin, a matriarchal black woman who becomes a juror in the case, giving him more than a casual interest in its outcome and in the convicted man's threat that he will kill every member of the jury when he gets out of jail.  In part two, the tension of courtroom dramatics completely subsides while Grisham indulges in Willie's development of his paper, his relationships, and town issues.  Grisham finally returns to the murder plotline in the last part, some years later, when the murderer has been paroled far earlier than he should have been, and members of the jury are getting killed.<br /><br /> The Last Juror makes a finely detailed read on issues of justice and civil rights but doesn't come up to Grisham's earlier novel for consistent intensity.  One has to appreciate, however, his absorbing way with the dimensions of character and human motivation, which explains its number two position on best seller lists (at the time of this writing).<br /><br />[...]
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is literally the best value for any cd i have ever encountered. You will never in your life find a better album for less money. The idea that this album is being offered to people for 9 dollars and some people out there havent bought it is almost an insult. I have listened to this ablum at least 150 times since i bought it, and i bought it for aruond 11 dollars. Unmeasurable amounts of joy have come out of this epic masterpiece by the best new band in the last 10 years. It already has a place on the list of my favorite albums, and ive listened to it more than almost any album i can remember.<BR>In fact, I've actually considered buying the album again just because its so good and so cheap. Either i didnt have it in my car at the time and i wanted to listen to it right then and there, or i figured having a second copy laying around wouldnt be a bad idea so it could be playing in 2 parts of the house so ill never be without it.<br />Bottom Line: Not only is it worth the measley 9 dollars, it is actually worth more than most cds I own... BUY IT!!!
080018789X|2.0|Although it starts promising enough, this movie soon turns into another predictable and unsurprising romantic comedy. The story is pure Hollywood fluff and the typical and expected ending confirms it. Ok, the acting is quite good, everyone was believable and gave solid performances, yet the plot is full of cliches and sometimes it`s way too annoying in its tender and sappy moments. Cameron Crowe did a decent job directing this, but overall &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; is a romantic comedy by-the-numbers, even if a couple of characters are a bit above cardboard charicatures. It`s a watchable movie, yet it brings nothing new and is far from innovative stuff. <BR>A rental at best.
B000002UE2|2.0|No we want to listen to some good heavy rock like what you used to play. I suppose when heavy rock bands plumb for commercial success they eventually end up taking off their shirts and prancing around in front of thousands of people singing &quot;the Locomotion&quot;, thats what happened here anyway. Grand Funk were never technically in the forefront of rock music but Terry Knights production kept your mind off the fact that these boys were not necessarily the brightest on the block ( Mark Farners outlook seems to be near to those fundamentalist survivalists who end up living in the backwoods with two years worth supply of tinned food ) . And they had another advantage, they were home grown talent as opposed to certain British bands who seemed to be doing rather well at the time. Side two of the Red Album is still a classic heavy rock experience mainly due to the way Knight produced the drums and bass and Farners solo on Inside Looking Out which he changes for the worse on this recording. By this time though Knight and Funk had long since parted company  unfortunately and big stadium blandness had set in, I guess it is why punk was invented.<br />I only ever went to one stadium concert and it was Grand Funk in Montreal circa 1973. I seem to remember the music being slighly harder and better than this but it was so hard trying to get involved with people who are dots on a stage over 100 yards away. Grand Funk did make some more ok studio recordings but for my money the big stadiums killed rock music. If you want to know how it should be done pick up a copy of Rory Gallaghers Irish Tour made around a year before this one in concert hall venues whose maximum capacity must have been around 2000-3000 people.
B000002BBY|2.0|During the mid-nineties, these guys were the next big thing, a band that would change rock forever and create something new and unique. Well, some people actually believed that Oasis would turn out to be all that, but frankly most of their albums were just lacking in originality, mood, power, credibility and, most of all, truly inspired songwriting. Their second record is just another average and bland britpop release with a couple of catchy singles (&quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Some Might Say&quot;), a few good songs (&quot;Morning Glory&quot;) and a lot of derivative filler. This effort is boring and forgettable for the most part, providing some mellow and formulaic songs with mundane lyrics and so-so vocals. Oasis always seem to make the same record, so choosing this one or another doesn`t make much of a difference. Their &quot;antagonists&quot; Blur became a far more creative and solid band, delivering solid and eclectic albums while accepting change and multiple influences along the way. Oasis are a Beatles rip-off and little else, even if they are able to create good songs ocasionally.<BR>Far from a keeper.
0345363132|5.0|What an awesome work this is.<br />Since Penman's prose is a bit headier than most these days, it may take a while to warm up to her style.  But once you do, this novel really sings.  Makes you feel as if you knew Richard.
0385512104|5.0|At first hesitant to read this book, I eventually found myself engulfed in one of the most wonderful stories to come out in a long time.  My hesitation dealt with the fact that the subject was a) an autistic child, and b) he was somewhat of a genius with math and physics.  None of these subjects really interested me, but what Haddon does with them is amazing.  Amazing, riveting, disturbing, funny, warm, and above all, human. The only real angst provoking aspect of this book is that I want to lend it to friends, yet can't seem to part with my own copy.  <br />Also recommended:  McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and &quot;The Life of Pi.&quot;

0790729989|5.0|&quot;Se7en&quot; can clearly be counted among the tops in the murder/mystery thriller type movies of all time as it is an extremely intense film that frightens the soul and fills the entertainment need for such movies.  Fair warning to the faint of heart as the graphics of this film are just as intense as the script itself.  Much of this film is based on the script being as intense as it as the two primary characters are trying to figure out who the killer is before he/she makes it all the way through the seven deadly sins; what I find difficult to believe when watching the film though is that the screenwriter felt it was necessary to resort to excessive bouts of cursing as opposed to reasonably intelligent verbiage.  I'm far from being a prude of any sort however, a thing can be taken too far and the language of this film was taken too far too often.<br />Performance wise, what else can be expected of Morgan Freeman other than another marvelous performance!  There are very few films in which he's starred that one could say weren't good films and parts for him; he continues to be one of the top actors in the industry.  Brad Pitt gives another great performance in this film despite his part being the one in which the screenwriter overindulged in a lack of intelligent writing.  Kevin Spacey's actual screen time is very limited in this film but his performance is extremely powerful.  Gwyneth Paltrow, such the beauty that she is, has a limited role in the film but leaves an impression nonetheless.<br />Director David Fincher who is probably best known for such films as the more recent &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Panic Room&quot; shows an exceptional stylistic flair in &quot;Seven&quot; that carries over to his other films.  He certainly deserves a fair amount of credit for this films success over the years.<br />The Premise:<br />New York City's finest, Detective Lieutenant William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) finds himself mired in an investigation of a serial killer only one week from retirement.  In comes his replacement, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who is eager to take over the case all on his own however, their Captain played by the high spirited retired Marine Corps Staff Sergeant turned Hollywood actor, R. Lee Ermey, refuses to just hand the case over to Mills.<br />What follows from there is an extremely intense film in which the two detectives are desperately trying to find a killer who is forcing his victims to more or less kill themselves based on the seven deadly sins before he makes it all the way through them...<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in this particular genre of filmmaking as it is, as stated above, an extremely intense thriller type film that will keep one guessing all the way to the extraordinarily frightening conclusion.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />The one true incongruity of this particular original DVD release of the film is that it is a two sided disc that only contains about half the film on the first side.  I don't know where New Line came up with their compression rate for this film and why but very few videophiles, myself included, are appreciative of having to flip a disc to continue the movie!  Fortunately, this particular release is out of stock and there are newer version out there in which this technical error has been alleviated.<br />-Cast &amp; Crew bios
630514415X|5.0|Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen) is the top high school prospect in the country.  His father, Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) is in jail for accidently killing his wife.  THe govenor has promised Jake that if he can convince his son to play for his alma mater that he will cut his prison time signifigantly.  Jesus has never forgiven his father and has hatred toward him.  There is tons of symbolism in this movie.  Ray Allen had a great debut, especially for a basketball player!  He really did a great job, and Denzel also gave a great performance as usual.  Go see this movie it is very moving and is my personal favorite of all time.

0440237688|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" is an intriguing science-fiction novel that is extremely hard to put down. It is a fast, interesting read for adults, teens, and children. <BR>The society portrayed in \\"The Giver\\" removes many vital traits from the citizens that make us human. Some of these are the ability to make decisions, the ability to make mistakes and learn from them, difference and individuality, love, and to a certain extent, intelligence. The people of the society are like robots, they are \\"programmed\\" to work, raise a family, and be released. The society believes that when you are released, you go to a different place. About 3/4 of the way through the book, the reader learns what it really means to be released. The truth will seem disturbing to the reader, but for the 'people' living in the Giver's society, it is simply how life works. They do not know any other way, and therefore do not speak out against it, or for that matter, against anything else that happens. <BR>Jonas, the main character, becomes the \\"receiver of memory\\" for the society. During the story, he goes through extensive training with the Giver (the old receiver) and starts to develop into a real human. He recieves memory of the past that show things such as sunshine and love, that the society is lacking. Jonas enjoys these feelings, he even knows that from experiencing the bad memories, he learns something. Jonas starts to feel alone, just as the Giver has for many years.<BR>\\"The Giver's\\" plot is very interesting. Although some details of the society and the characters are missing, the book is well written and enjoyable.<BR>I recommend \\"The Giver\\" to anyone. I loved the book!

B000002KHH|4.0|Back before Black Sabbath ruined their reputation with all those cheesy 80's albums(and that unfortunate stint with James Dio) they were a stark contrast to the hippie revolution with their realistic, brooding low tonal metal. Paranoid is a look back into those glory days. Guitarist Tony Iommi had the art of riffs down to a pure science, especially on &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;War Pigs&quot;. The rythym section kept everything moving with surprising tightness and precision and Osbourne, in his pre &quot;bundles of irritation&quot; days (also known as Jack and Kelly) sounds genuinely downtrodden, resentful and scary.
B00009UW0N|4.0|I am not a Halloween fan, Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th series is my main man, but Michael Myers is a good watch. The story begins with litte Mike dressed as a clown for Halloween. He savagely kills his sister and her boyfriend while having sex (...)Anyway after that little Mike is sent to an asylum for the next 20 years. But evil does come home to roost.<br />Jamir Lee Curtis stars in this flick as the heroine. She was always Hollywood's ugly duckling. I never found her attractive in the least, (...)<br />The movies pays more attention to building up the character of Michael, rather than just brainless slayings. From his doctor we learn much about him, however the real ride begins in part II where we learn even more.<br />I will admit though, of the three modern slashers (Jason, Freddy, and Michael) The Halloween series has the best theme music. That is a cool tune.
B0000069NM|5.0|This disc is unbelievable.  Although Scofield wrotes the tunes, just as much credit has to be given to MMW on this disc.  Martin and Wood hold down the tightest groove throughout the disc and Medeski is the perfect counterpart to Sco's solos and melodies.  This disc really hints at what Sco would be up to a few years later with &quot;Uberjam&quot;  and the current John Scofield Band.  These guys know how to play together and it really shows on this disc.
0767817478|1.0|Words cannot describe this over-hyped, high budget disaster. Godzilla in New York sounds like a great idea, too bad 'great' never made it to any of the other levels. The whole thing is ridiculous, from Matthew Broderick collecting home pregnancy kits, to mini-Godzillas taking over Madison Square Garden. Brave French fighters join in on the act (ha ha ha!!!!!). They left a loophole at the end to make a sequel, just pray that it never happens. The Japanese should be scratching their heads wondering what the hell Hollywood was thinking with this disaster.

0385336810|3.0|Emma Corrigan feels life as she has had a fabulous year though the Pollyanna young woman always sees the optimistic side of things.  Still she has a right to feel great as she  stays employed at Panther Cola for nearly a year and is seeing the perfect Ken-doll like boyfriend Connor.  She even thinks she is on the right track for a promotion now that the opportunity has occurred for her to show off her talent.<br />However her chance flops and a desponded Emma flies home expecting the worse at the office.  She vents on the plane to her row mate while flying in nasty weather telling her deepest secrets about her weight, NATO, and other things.  The next day at work Emma meets her plane partner Jack Harper, Panther Cola CEO visiting the British Branch.  Embarrassed Emma tries to hide, but Jack will not let her though neither knows where a cross Atlantic relationship will go.<br />This chick lit tale on the one hand stars a precocious witty protagonist, but on the other hand condones fibbing, omissions, and stretching the truth to sell a product.  Jack is a wonderful protagonist, but one must wonder what is in the energy bar because Emma acts so childish at times.  Still the audience will enjoy this often amusing romp because no one really knows Jack who has a secret or two to share only with Emma.<br />Harriet Klausner
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have watched lots of movies in my 30+ years.  Many of my favorites are dramas that my friends say are &quot;slow&quot;.  When I heard this movie might be a bit slow, I still didn't hesitate to rent it.  What a mistake!  This movie never got going.  It was one slow scene after another. There was little dialogue, little humor, and little of anything to be honest.  <br />Also, the movie was easy to get &quot;lost&quot; in.  The Quiz show scene and many others were so brief it left one puzzled why they were even included.  The acting was okay, but it gave Bill Murray little to do with such a dull script.  If you are looking for good dramas I'd recommend Sea Buscuit, Radio, or nearly anything else in the video store.
B000000I0I|4.0|Thirty years on and time has been pretty unfair to \\"Ommadawn\\". Clever and skilful in its mixing of Celtic and African styles it was, quite rightly, lauded as \\"groundbreaking\\" on its release. Today, shorn of this interest, its fundamental weaknesses - in particular, its heavy handed production and Oldfield's simplistic, overly loud and \\"fuzz drenched\\" guitar breaks - show it up to be a fairly \\"average\\" album. And, in the bombastic instrumental work-outs on track 2 and the banal, hippie drenched lyrics of its \\"hidden\\" track 3, it stands as a near perfect example of everything that punk was shouting back at in 1977.       But in there (12 minutes 30 seconds into track 1 to be precise) is something quite magical... seven minutes of glorious music that has not only stood the test of time but which remains, to this day, one of the most exquisite and exciting things you may ever hear. Driven along by African drumming and a mesmeric vocal chant, and including some wonderfully discordant brass flourishes and Oldfield's screeching (and in this case, wholly effective) guitarwork, it builds from a beautifully atmospheric & understated three minute start into a thrilling and abrupt climax before switching, quite brilliantly, into the soft and evocative back-beat of the tribal drums. A short nugget of pure genius - you've spent your money on much worse.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This soundtrack, like the movie, leaves you almost speechless.  I only got the soundtrack yesterday, but I must have listened to it a million times already.  It's an emotional experience all on its own.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Being Black British we don't seem to have a saturation of rap in our music market and therefore I've never really gotten into it, except in the case of Tupac who was a &quot;muscial prophet&quot;.  Anyways, I heard &quot;Through the wire&quot; on MTV all weekend and I bought the album on the strength of this song alone.  Fortunately, it was not a waste of money.  I'm not sure about giving God thanks in one song and singing profanities in another but when all is said and done this album is immensely good listening.  I wish Kanye every success in his career as an artist.  Well done.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This movie nearly ruined the whole series for me.  The first movie was truly an excellent film.  The second was not as great, but I could still bare it.  The third one sucked.  Flat out.  In fact, I think it made the second one worse knowing what it was setting up.  I'm thinking I'm probably going to sell my Reloaded DVD and forget Reloaded and Revolutions ever happened.  I think the only thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was the fight for Zion.  The rest...well, it just makes me shake my head.  The Mr. Smith story line ended badly, and the movie ended with a freaking sunrise.  Great.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is in my opinion the greatest hard rock album of the 90s although Metallica's  self titled album,Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Sprial and Guns N Roses' Use Your Illusion set(to me all those albums would be tied for second place) come very close.Its also probably the darkest one.While it doesnt make me feel bad at all it may leave some people feeling quite depressed especially if they already have depression to begin with.It starts off with the explosive yet catchy them bones and ends with Would(my favorite Alice In Chains song ever) and ends with the melodic yet metallic Would and doesnt have a layer of fat in between.Jerry Cantrell is one of the most talented guitarists to come out of the 90s hard rock scene and Layne Staley has an undeniably great voice.Dam That River is a punky song that has a cool play on words,Rain When I Die has some of the best guitar tones ever,Down In A Hole is my favorite ballad ever,Sickman is heavy with excellent vocals and lyrics,Rooster is one of the grunge scene's best anthems,Junkhead is very cool,Dirt is scary,Godsmack is one of the best songs on the album,Hate To Feel and Angry Chair are heavy yet both have great hooks and Would is the best song on the album.In conclusion Dirt is Alice In Chains' best albums and my favorite grunge rock record ever recorded.

I must say the visional backstage lighting is absolutely breath taking,the music 'flight of the Walkure'(Siegfried 3) and 'Siegfried's funeral march'(Gotterdammerung 4) are memorable. In all four opera's,you will find them using costumes of ancient 'Nordic' times. You may say what's so unusual about that,now adays they have the performers dress in shorts,bright colored hawaiin shirts,wear sunglasses,and carry brief cases on stage. I guess its used to draw your attention,it works,at least for me. But don't worry,you wont find that here in this 'opera set'.

He generates the suspense of Hitchcock and the out-thereness of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; together in a fairly taught narrative.  I got pulled into this book and it walked a new terrain.  Very original.  Very bewildering.  A fun reading event.  Like nothing I've read before.  May be worth a try for you?
0385504209|2.0|Sorry, I don't agree with all the hype.  I found the book boring at times and to be honest about half way through the book I realized I didn't care what happened to the main characters.  I only finished the book because everyone I know had read it...so I thought it would get better as I got to the end...<br />It didn't!<br />Some of the history of the Catholic church is interesting... but that is about it!<br />Don't bother.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I cant really give a review of this movie. So many things happened at once. I want to give it a good score, but so many ppl will say it sucked, and why is that? Is it the ending? My solution, create another ending for the DVD. If u want to see the original put it on there too, but seriously that makes a lot of ppl disappointed, including me. I was stunned while it finished in the theater, not able to realize why I came and have that 'wave crash down on me'. Freakin sunrise...If we want to get technical about it, couldnt wachowski 1 and wachowski 2 write better dialogue for the one who usually plays a dude. I cringed when the audience laughed at that. I then knew something wasnt right. Maybe the theater put something in the drinks, mine was flat, screwed me starting there. I enjoyed the battle scenes in Zion, ppl complain cause theres nothing spectactular about bullets in the real world, well tough. I also enjoyed the scenes with the machine city (but somebody explain why he still has powers here?) They could have added a little extra to the club hell scene, kinda ended suddenly. And something was strange about the Neo/Smith fight scene. Flying thru the air almost seemed like a episode of DBZ, not that I watch that. Why did Gloria Foster(Oracle from 1 and 2) have to die, that would have saved some confusion. And this subway station with Indian ppl? The point is...idk maybe there is no point now. I got everything built up for it, and I expect more than a stupid sunrise.

B0001HAISQ|5.0|when it first opened here, i thought, what's all the big hoo-huh about it? Peter Pan's supposed to be a cartoon for kids, i surmised,but after i watched it, it turned out to be the most fabulous movie i've ever watched. How can i ever describe how wonderful it is just by words alone. It evokes so many emotions that leave you feeling intensely enchanted. i read the book after watching the movie and it was as absorbing as the movie itself. It is simply such a beautiful story. the movie is a masterpiece of imagination that incorporates all the essential elements of the story and captures the magic of peter pan effectively. It is incredibly fantasy-like but still manages to retain and successfully convey those same ideas and emotions that the original story has. That is the most fantastic combination,i reckon. this is a must-watch, and a must-own!
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Sometimes you can listen too much to everybody else's opinions.  If I had gone with my own gut instinct to see Gothika in the theater last summer I wouldn't have missed out on a very good film; professional critics can be wrong you know.  In any case, now that I've seen it I can't understand why it didn't get better critical reactions.  This was a movie well worth the admission price, more so than some that the critics raved about last year.<br />Gothika is a creepy film noir-style thriller about a women's prison psychiatrist, Dr. Miranda Grey, and the events of one night that changed everything.  She wakes up in her own ward to discover her husband brutally murdered and herself the suspect under the care of a former colleague played by Robert Downey Jr.  She hears and feels the presence of something supernatural harassing her almost constantly.  Although in her heart she knows she is sane, she begins to doubt herself as she sees and hears things with no explanation and becomes more and more paranoid.  A former patient, Chloe, is a girl who has been telling similar stories all along and now it is starting to look as if she really might have been visited by an evil spirit.  So Dr. Grey now has to convince everyone around her, including herself, that what she has been experiencing is not the delusions of somebody in denial.  Not easy for an apparent madwoman shrieking in a cell.<br />The most disturbing thing about this story wasn't even the spirit(s) but the way that her friends and coworkers so quickly and completely dismissed her as insane; immediately she was one of \\"them\\" and not the person they had worked alongside for years.  To me, the greatest source of angst came from her sudden invisibility as a human being.  But there is a generous measure of moody terror, and the stark, quiet grayness of the prison halls at night time proved a very effective setting for dread.  I was able to feel the chill of the place sitting on my couch at home very nicely.  Thumbs up to the director!<br />I can just hear those voices now, complaining that there were some cliches and predictable plot elements.  Honestly, I have seen my share of thrillers--I really did not see the plot twist coming.  That's a testament to the well-crafted nature of this story.  As for cliches, well, nighttime settings with storms and dramatic lightening do make for good visual backdrops for horror films.  There's a reason those things became cliches, and that's because they work well. The use of these types of things are forgiveable in my book as long as the rest of the film is effectively done.<br />Yes, other people's opinions are valuable, and other points of view can be enlightening.  But sometimes you just know your intuition is the right one even if everybody all around you is screaming the opposite. In this case I know I'm not crazy or stupid; Gothika is a worthy supernatural thriller for fans of the genre.  Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.<BR>-Andrea aka Merribelle
B000060MY6|5.0|I share the opinion of those who think Mulholland DR is probably the best film ever in the history of cinema. I havent seen all films, but I have seen a lot and none is as good as Mulholland Dr.<br />Everything is perfect in that movie, every shot, every angle, every sound, every actor, there are not life time performances by the actors, but they all match together so fine. it is a very well done movie, and it's full of ideas. Of course, if you are a pop-culture movie fan, this one is not for you. Stay away.<br />if you want to see how the french new wave, or the best of Felini can be surpassed by Lynch, well you got a chance with Mulholland Dr. Do I dare advize those of you who are likely to love this movie ( I think you dont need this advice really), but dont see it as a movie to explain, dont look for the clue, of course you can find it a clue, as many clues as you want. But see it rather as a metaphoric display of the artist psyche, oh boy, it gets so much tastier this way.<br />I 've seen it five times, i can see it some 50 other more. I'm just curious if there is a better movie than this one, or is probably Dogville better? I dont think so.
B000001DYY|4.0|Tears for Fears were one of the rare pop groups whose music survived the 80's image and still sounds great today.  After the classic &quot;Seeds of Love&quot;, the duo broke up.  Roland Orzabel recorded this follow up without Curt Smith.  While the music is missing some of the vocal balance of their previous work, this CD contains one of their best songs:  &quot;Break It Down Again&quot;.  Part of the song lyrics below show the introspection the band is famous for:<br />&quot;It's in the way you're always hiding from the light, See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb, No revolution maybe someone somewhere else, Could show you something new about you and your inner song - And all the love and all the love in the world, Won't stop the rain from falling, Waste seeping underground  - I want to break it down....Break it down again&quot;<br />The rest of the CD has some great moments as well, and typical of the band, the lyrics and songwriting is well above the meaningless chatter of most pop songs.<br />The title track &quot;Elemental&quot; , and the driving &quot;Dog's a Best Friends Dog&quot; are on par with their previous work, while the smooth and moody &quot;Gas Giants&quot; sounds like an updated &quot;Working Hour&quot; intro.  Of particular note is &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; an obvious slam on his departed band mate.<br />While the music always takes me back to Virginia, and my grad school days, it still sounds up to date as well.  A great addition to your collection.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  I saw it 4 years ago and decided to order it recently.  It's so subtle and lovely.  Even more lovely is the music and soundtrack that plays during the whole movie.  Does ANYone know the name of the two operas sung during the music hall scene?  <br />If you're boarderline on deciding -- get this movie!  The performances are superb -- they really make you feel like you're a part of the times and story.

B00004ZAV3|1.0|Beatle this, Beatle that, blah blah blah<br />Buy a Yoko cd and forget this overrated tripe.   Her career has been more fruitful and she's sold more records and lasted longer than the Beatles.<br />The Beatles had one good song,  Ballad Of John And Yoko,  no more, no less.   The Beatles would be a forgotten 60's band like Herman's Hermits and Dave Clark Five if it wasn't for the star power of Yoko to make them superstars in the late 60's.<br />Skip this, and buy Yoko's Walking On Thin Ice cd instead.   This is the most overrated music in history.
0385504209|3.0|The secret to good history-based fiction lies in the inability of the reader to detect what information is fact and what is fiction. One glaring error and the entire historical foundation immediately becomes open to question. An error of that magnitude occurs early in this book and caused me to laugh my way through the remainder. Mr. Brown's protagonist claims (in one of his many lectures disguised as dialog) that 5,000,000 women died in the witch hunts of the Middle Ages. The highest number ever calculated by experts was 100,000. Even that number has since been downgraded to 50,000 and while most were women (15% were men), the church had little to do directly with the trials and executions, except to encourage prosecutors and judges. Much of the remaining history can be found in other sources, many of which are fringe historians and/or conspiracy buffs. The plot is not bad if you accept the existence of centuries old secret societies and global conspiracies. If you don't; well there is no plot without those. Ultimately, this is simply more fuel for those intoxicated with conspiracy paranoia.
1883217040|5.0|By all means, if you've been confused with theory in the past, buy this book! I could have easily saved myself several hundred dollars I've spent on other materials that only left me as confused as I was when I started or at best taught me fragments of theory that I couldn't piece together in a cohesive manner if I'd just bought this book first. Levine's book shows you the how and the why in a way that is easy to understand and builds on itself so that you &quot;get it&quot; and can apply it. I can't recommend it highly enough!

Recommend this to EVERYONE. A must read! Dont miss out!
B00013F38K|4.0|I am normally a bit of a purist about aspect ratios so I was a bit nervous when I found out that Kung Fu was being reformatted. However, I have to say that a great deal of care has been taken over it and the series looks visually stunning as a result. We should remember that one of Kung Fu's strengths was the excellent editing work. In this case the image has been edited and restored so that it looks wide and sweeping. The image is anamorphically enhanced for widesreen t.v.s so the detail of the wonderful sets and landscapes can be enjoyed as they never have been previously. This stands up so well in direction, scripting and cimematography that it looks like a theatrical feature. The box is also nicely put together with beautiful photos. A few audio comentaries would not go amiss as the extras are a bit sparse. <BR>However, the really important part of this package is the wonderful stories and drama. If you enjoyed this show and have been dissapointed by poor quality prints and commercial breaks in cable showings- buy this and watch it again for the first time.<BR>Give the widescreen a chance and if you don't like it please be thankful that it is out on release and that people have taken care with it.<BR>I think it is also worth pointing out that from a philosophical point of view this show is once again extrememly relevant. Lots of young people today are questioning the approaches of the adult world again in the way which they did when Kung Fu was first broadcast. When Caine is asked at the end of one of the episodes: 'If I don't have a right to revenge then who does?' Caine says 'no-one'. <BR>This show should be required viewing for anyone who thinks guns or bombs are the way forward, whatever their political background.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This movie is quite good. I love the revelation of Tokyo which I'm guessing is a first for most westerners. The gamer subculture glimpsed in the arcade parlor is amazing. As others have noted though, the dvd begins with a MOST annoying preview that will only let you fast forward (no disk skip or menu!). When I buy a DVD I want to be able to control every aspect of it and when a manufacturer impinges on the control of my own property it makes me annoyed and angry. Is that the emotion Universal expected from buyers by doing this? Oh and the case has no insert but it does have weird clasps which are sure to break off with repeated use. It's better than a cardboard case at least.
B00003CWTI|5.0|The movie starts and  you're caught in the stories that life can offer for us to know, and with the hand of liitle more than genious Paul Thomas Anderson, Magnolia offers you the chance to experience sweet, sour, devastating, funny, dramatic moments in the life of some people one rainy day in San Fernando Valley. <br />Magistral performances. Excellent dialogue. Refreshing yet classical direction. All this and much, much more is magnolia. A three hour rollercoaster of emotions driven by the unexplicable human behavior in a mosaic of characters as big and as little as our lives.<br />Claudia Gator- A  junkie  carrying the burden of a great secret on her shoulders. Mellorah Walters performance is magnificent. Laughing, crying or screaming, Mellorah manages to capture Claudia's constant desire to be saved and loved. <br />Jim- One of the last genuine good people left in San Fernando and the world, jim's only wish is to help people and find someone to love. Tough sometimes ingenuous jim manages to make you beleive in his good intensions towards others. One day someone or something hears his call and he meets claudia and he's not willing to let this pass by. john c reilly's performance could not be better.<br />jimmy Gator- Phillip Baker Hall is superb displaying an amazing dominium of his experienced actor skills. A regular family man, famous host of the most popular tv show ''what do kids know?''. however our whole opinion and view of this character will change when he makes his final confession to his wife. Claudia's secret is then revealed and so is jimmy and our minds and judmental side start to interact with this complex characters.<br />Donnie Smith-A former child star of jimmy's show William H Macy's character has a crush on a young bar tender and his idea of getting him is as human as can be. The whole character is defined with his great dialogue. ''I really do have love to give. I just dont know where to put it.''<br />Stanley Spector-the new star of jimmy's show. Stanley the boy genious has all the answers in his head except why is his father that way to him?. Why can't he be nicer to him?. As complex as the father who sees in his son the chance to do what he couldn't. Stanley's greatest moment is when he stands before his father and simply says \\"You need to be nicer to me dad\\".<br />Linda Partridge-julianne Moore, truly one of the best actreses of our time. In constant pain for marrying her husband out of money and realizing now that she loves him, only to discover that he is dying. Linda partridge's constant euphoria is expressed when at a drug store the whispers and comments of the clerk on account of all the medicine she buys really sets her off. \\"Have you seen death on your bed?\\" she asks him with a look that says more than her vivid words.<br />Earl Partridge- As he describes him self, he doesnt want to be an old man dying on a bed trying to get a hold of the lost son, he hates that idea, but he hates it the most because that is just what he is. Its at the final moments of his life when he realizes how human he was and that is painful to him.<br />Frank T. J Mackey- Tom Cruise's greatest performance so far, another great character with a big secret about his past. a secret that would only make him look week and vulnerable, something not convenient for a Self motivation sex-guru known all over the country by his famous dogma \\"seduce and destroy\\". Cruise's succeds at capturing how uncomfortable we can get at a conversation when we are exposed. In his case, his past is revealed in front of the cameras by a reporter. Cruise's performance at these scenes is just amazing.<br />Phil Parma- Earl's nurse, phil feels that he has the need to help earl's final whish come true and he works as a channel for it. phillip seymour hoffman's performance is remarkable even in the little scenes. Not knowing how to find this tv guru, phill does everything he can to find frank, from going thru the phone book, checking playboy channels and calling pink dot to buy dirty magazines. These scenes are also great.<br />All these characters get in touch and into our lives thru magnolia. <br />Right at the end, when things are falling down, when we're reaching the black holes life sometimes has, when we feel we cannot take it anymore. All we need is a little bit of perspective. And Phill Parma says \\"oh my god there are frogs falling from the sky\\" And indeed they are, on one of the most irreverent and beautiful scenes of cinema. and if to this you add aimee mann's bitter/sweet songs you will not be dissapointed.<br />All in all magnolia is a great piece of cinema and something is garanteed, at some point even if its just a second, you will see your self there at San Fernando valley one rainy day.<br />adrian3030@swissinfo.org
B00007JVBI|4.0|Chan Marshall is truly an American treasure. One can fantasize her sitting on the front porch, dreamy, strumming away her fleeting thoughts and authentic heartfelt tunes on a cheap guitar before she runs off to meet the 'dirty three' for a gig at the roadhouse. There is no pop hype and highly produced crap here. She is the real thing. If a person is looking for the industry formula like Janet Jackson, or the popular sound of Beth Orton (who she is often compared to), Cat Power will bore you to tears. But is you want the real thing, low budget reality, Chan Marshall is easy to love and respect as a REAL female musician who is a diamond in the rough.<BR>  'You Are Free' is a sweet transition from her past. She seems to have isolated the best moods of 'What Would The Community Think' with the metronome mantra of 'Moon Pix' and settled with her signature sound, in spite of her strange behavior as a live performer. All cuts on 'You Are Free' are exclusively Chan Marshall. When you first hear 'He War' you will ask yourself &quot;have I ever heard anything like this before?&quot; Your final answer will be &quot;No&quot;. Dave Grohl's influence on 'Speak For Me' is conspicuous. I truly hope they work together on her next album. 'I Don't Blame You', 'Good Woman'  and 'Fool' epitomise the lone Chan. Michael Hurley should be blushing to hear his ol tune 'Werewolf' swaggered by Chan. Last but not least, Is she giving Eddie Vetter a singing lesson on 'Evolution'?<BR>   I will support Chan/ Cat Power through her career. This is american music...pure and simple...without the frills.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I have loved Pink Floyd and this album for almost 30 years.  I have owned it on vinyl, and several versions on CD.  Though it is not my favorite Pink Floyd album (&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; takes that cake), I have always recognized it for the fantastic achievement it is. <br />Dark Side is the result of a collaboration of a genius band at the height of its creative powers, and a young engineer, Alan Parsons, a whiz in the recording studio (and musically no slouch himself).  The result is a groundbreaking concept album that sounds like nothing that came before.  From the ambient soundscape of &quot;Speak to Me&quot;, to the mellow &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;, the rockers &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;, the trance-like &quot;On the Run&quot;, the wordless vocal solo on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;, and the jazzy &quot;Any Colour you Like&quot;, the range of musical styles and influences is amazing, especially considering that the tunes all hang together as a cohesive whole.  The lyrics explore themes of death, madness, and the daily struggle to make a living.<br />In any case, I could not live in a world where DSOTM was available in a format I could not play, so the release of this SACD prompted me to get a universal DVD/SACD/DVD-A player, and I am not the least bit sorry.  Someone who loves this album obviously did the multichannel mix, and it is amazing.  The surround channels are used to a great extent, which is possible with densely layered music such as this, but they never become distracting.  The original tapes must have been cleaned up digitally, because the disc sounds like it was recorded yesterday.<br />In sort, if you are interested in  multichannel audio, run, don't walk, to the store and buy this disc.  Even if you are stuck in the 19th century with just a CD player, you can listen to this disc as it is a dual layer hybrid with a standard stereo CD layer in addition to the multichannel SACD layer.<br />Five starsfor musical content, five for sound quality
B0000TB01Y|5.0|As we say in Australia.... Wicked! Sick! Sweet! Tops! This is a classic! Is is fantastically spine tingling and the orchestration is unbelievable. A MUST HAVE for any musical fan. Best thing I've heard in years! If you dont buy this album you are definitely missing out!
B00006CXXU|4.0|... why people dislike this girl so much. She's been stigmatized God knows why (can anyone seriously say she's a worse dresser-hoe than any of her contemporaries?) and somehow people can't get past her raunchy image. I could see that happening with other talentless artists of her generation who have nothing to offer but their sylicon-enhanced, Photoshop improved bodies. In her case, though, I don't get why anyone would even care what she's wearing.<BR>Christina Aguilera is a young singer of phenomenal talent. Her voice has grown more powerful and versatile, and I love the fact that they decided to leave &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; notes in songs like Beautiful and Fighter (although the letter is quite a mediocre song). I still have goosebumps after seeing her live performance at the Grammys. She, for a change sings with her mic ON. And unlike technically perfect bores like Celine Dion  and Whitney Houston, you can feel her joy for singing in each song, be it a ballad or an upbeat song.<BR>Given, the album is somewhat uneven. And so what? Her growth is undeniable and she's only 23. Make no mistake about it, she'll be around long after her pop-tart peers have sunk under their own lack of talent and overexposure.<BR>Buy the album, it is a more than decent listen. By the way, most people seem not to like &quot;Soar&quot;; it is one of my favorite songs of the album if not THE favorite. Her vocals are mind-blowing on this one.
B000001F5F|4.0|I bought this album on vinyl back 'in the day'. Subsequently, I bought it on cassette, and finally on CD, so you might say that I like it a lot.  The energy in these live versions really make the more careful studio versions seem less vital.  The version of `Party Girl' here totally wipes out the B-Side studio version (which can be found on the two disc edition of `Best of 1980-1990').<br />As some reviewers have noted, part of the track 'Electric Co' is missing a bit during an interlude in the song where Bono starts singing part of 'America' from West Side Story and 'Send in the Clowns' from A Little Night Music. Of course, our Draconian copyright laws being what they are, these brief references had to be cut to avoid a lawsuit, I suppose.  The cut is reflected on the tape and the CD.  What I don't understand is why U2 can't just go ahead and clear the rights for the use of these snippets, so future CD editions can include what was taken out.  <br />(Copyright-related Note:  Years later, U2's label, Island Records sued the group Negativland after it incorporated 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' into a joke sound collage that they released as a single that they called `U2'.  That's now available, though, as a bootleg entitled 'These Guys Are From England...' which is quite hilarious, though some may find it offensive.)<br />For those who think that it's a rip-off that this album is so short, keep in mind that it's a lower-priced E.P., not a full-length album.  Also, remember that Rattle &amp; Hum, U2's other foray into the live genre, was a double album, making this seem all the more lacking in material.  Moreover, U2 wasn't quite what they are now (a huge supergroup) back then, so this E.P. was more of a marketing taster to give people an idea of how great U2 is live.  A big live album wouldn't have been justified at the time.  Some still don't think Rattle &amp; Hum was such a good idea.<br />By the way, this E.P. was recorded using material from theirconcerts in Boston and West Germany as well as Denver, so these songs are not quite the same live versions that exist on the longer 'Live from Red Rocks' video.

0385336810|4.0|Can You Keep a Secret? Is a fun book, with characters you care about, and feel like you could meet on the street. Just like Kinsella's Shopaholic series the heroine is charming, optimistic, intelligent, and is gripping with her insights and insecurities. The story is written in first person giving the book a personal touch. The set up of this story is very interesting. Emma afraid she is going to die confesses her secrets to a fellow passenger, only to discover he is her boss and a multimillionaire CEO. Now Emma must do every thing in her power to make sure that he keeps her secrets and dose not fire her. While not the next great novel this is the perfect book if you are looking for a happy, entertaining, lighthearted book.
B0000262I4|5.0|This 1979 Norma features Renata Scotto in one of her very best recordings.  She is in gorgeous vocal estate, with much exquisite pianissimo singing above the stave.  Surprisingly, Scotto is one of the few native Italians to essay this most difficult bel canto role, and she brings an innate understanding of the text and music.  Her Adalgisa, Tatiana Troyanos is likewise in rapturous voice, blending beautifully with Scotto in their duets.  Giacomini is a very baritonal tenor, in the Jon Vickers mold, who sings with great panache and vocal security in this fiendsihly difficult tenor role.  He sounds very masculine, which fits the character perfectly.  James Levine conducts a quite exciting performance, if possibly a bit more Verdian than Bellinian in style - a small quibble.  The late analog recording sounds fine in its CD remastering, with the chorus and orchestra captured well, and balanced nicely with the soloists.  A nice alternative to the Callas and Sutherland recordings...
B00000G3AZ|1.0|Dreadful adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma.  The book deserves far, far better -- perhaps a mini-series like the wonderful versions of P&amp;P, or a more talented screenwriter such as Thompson's S&amp;S.  The Paltrow Emma is paltry, leaving out critical scenes, and then inserting strange ones (what is that harvest scene doing at the end, anyway).
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a middle-aged has-been actor whose marriage is on thin ice but has been given two million dollars to shoot whiskey commercials in Japan.  Scarlett Johansson is Ivy league-educated Charlotte, who's tagging along with her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) and has too much free time on her hands.  Both Bob and Charlotte are bored out of their skulls, unfulfilled, and cross paths in downtown Tokyo.  This could have been the premise for a great romance, expect that director Sophia Coppola gives little reason to care about either the characters or their predicaments.  Not to mention that this movie drags and drags with not much in the way of a plot.  But &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; isn't a total bust.  Murray and Johansson do the best they can with the material they have to work with, and cinematographer Lance Acord deserves props for filming the city of Tokyo so beautifully.  And while this film does have its share of laughs (most of which, it must be said, are at the expense of the Japanese, who are made to look like fools), you can't help but notice that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is an average movie that's pretty empty at its core. It's not a disaster, but it's not exactly deserving of its praise.
B0001IN0DA|2.0|I can't believe that J.r. and all of the other announcers and wrestlers of both RAW and Smackdown were calling this the greatest Wrestlemania of all time. Wrestlemania X8 was better than this one. Although the buildup and the hype was there and there was a reason for almost every match (excluding the 2 Fatal 4 Way Tag Matches) the matches didn't pull through. All of the matches that should've been some of the greatest matches of all time (Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar, Undertaker vs. Kane) lasted for about 5 minutes. It made me feel like I was watching Smackdown or RAW and paying $50 to see it live. Anyways here is a list of all the matches and my rating for them:<br />John Cena vs. Big Show (U.S. Title): 2/5 a very mediocre match. The only good thing is that Cena won<br />RVD and Booker T vs. The Dudley's vs. Cade and Jindrak vs. La Resistance: 1/5 Boring!!! Can someone please tell me why Cade and Jindrak are on the card at WRESTLEMANIA!!!<br />Jericho vs. Christian: 4/5 a pretty good match with lots of buildup and emotion going into it the ending is extremely surprising too, Jericho is my favorite wrestler so of course I'm going to love this match.<br />Cruiserweight Open: 3/5 it would've been better if it was longer than 5 minutes<br />Rock and Foley vs. Evolution: 2/5 probably The Rock and Foley's worst Wrestlemania match. This is another match that could have been 10 times better if they would have actually taken the time to slow it down and make it last more than 5 minutes<br />Lesnar vs. Goldberg: 1/5 the most disapointing match I've ever seen. This match could have been a classic, one that we could tell our grandchildren about. (okay maybe not, lol) but still this should have been and epic encounter. All they did was stare at each other for about 15 minutes and then Goldberg Jackhammered Brock, Brock f-5'd Goldberg, Goldberg Speared Brock, Austin counts 1-2-3. Austin didn't even get involved. Probably the most half-assed match I've ever seen. It was both of these wrestlers last match and unfortunatly this is what everyone is going to remember them for. You'd think that since it was their last match they would have at least made some effort in it.<br />Playboy Evening Gown Match: 1/5 match [stinked] but the (...), that was the only good part<br />Victoria vs. Molly Holly: 1/5 no comment<br />Too Cool vs. APA vs. The Bashams vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team: 1/5 slightly better than the Raw match not much though<br />Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle: 2/5 CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY EDDIE GUERRERO IS THE WWE CHAMPION!!!<br />Undertaker vs. Kane: 3/5 only cool part was Taker's entrance, other than that it was just another average match. Another 5 minuter.<br />HHH vs. Chris Beniot vs. HBK: 4/5 The best match of the night but an extremely mediocre main event for Wrestlemania. Triple Threat Matches never seem to work the way they should. The mathc would have been better if it was just Micheals and HHH. It also would have been better if Beniot wouldn't have (...).
B00012QM8G|2.0|My first DVD froze and skipped during the Liquidation of the Ghetto. I just received a replacement copy from Amazon (thanks for the speedy delivery). Watched it and it all seems okay. But I'm not sure. During the exact same spot where the first DVD froze and skipped, it doesn't do it now. However, it freezes for 2-3 seconds before continuing. Is this right? Could it be because the DVD was shifting to the 2nd layer? And there's another question. Is this a double-layer, double-sided disc? Great movie, but disappointing production. Another case of trying to get the most profit from the least input?
B000002IAS|5.0|I bought this album while I was in Japan in 1970. The ONLY reason I bought it was because I wanted to get something and it said &quot;With Eric Clapton&quot;. Never heard of D&amp;B before. When I got it back home I read the back of the album, to see who was on it and I was floored! I put it on the turntable (You remember them?) the first time that night when a bunch of friends came over. It was the ONLY album we played that night! And from then on it got played at least once a night when ever anyone came over. 5 years ago I told a friend about it and the rave started all over. If you get this album be prepared to put all your others away for a while.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Well these guys rock. Their style is very simple, but they put it together and make is sound good. Thats what makes these guys talented. They've got a little white stripes/strokes sound going on so their not breakthrough but they still rock.
0790729725|1.0|Goodfellas is arguably one of the best movies ever put on film.  Unfortunately, Warner Brothers has done a fine job of screwing-up our ability to enjoy this masterpiece at home.  The &quot;modern&quot; DVD version of this movie is primative at best.  It is one of the few, single-layered antiques in existence that you must flip midway through the movie.  Pathetic.  They would've been better-off releasing this on Beta.  Sadly, if you are one of the many out there who hold this movie in the high regard that I do, you're obligated to own it - just don't get too comfortable.  Before you know it, you'll be getting-up to flip your &quot;DVD&quot; as if it were an old Earth, Wind and Fire album.  If anyone from Warner Brothers reads this review, do yourselves a favor and release a special edition of this classic.  Then go get your shine box!
B0001IN0DA|2.0|Im a huge mania fan I own all of the videos/DVDs, and after a few bad recent manias(anything after X7) I really thought this one would live up to the hype, I was wrong.  On paper quite a few of the matches looked really good, but really the only one out of the 13 that lived up to that was the Triple Threat Match Feat. Benoit, HBK and HHH.  All the other talent put on a pretty average show.  The best part of the show for me was Lesnar and Goldberg stinking up MSG.  I knew Goldberg didn't care much for the sport but I didnt see Lesnar Leaving so soon.  Also another downer was the huge return of the Deadman The Undertaker, oh no wait hes just died his hair black and looks exactly the same as he did 6 months ago.  For me after watching this I felt like I just wasted 5 hours
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Having owned the original CD edition of 'Tusk' for many years, I was excited to hear that this was one of the Fleetwood Mac albums chosen to be given the lavish reissue treatment.  It was well worth the anticipation, for this edition is a dream come true for anyone who enjoyed 'Tusk' the first time around.<br />The second disk of bonus material is awesome, with lots of interesting versions of tracks that made the album, and a few that stem from the recording sessions.  The standout is a 9 minute rough cut of &quot;Sara&quot; that is not to be missed!  I felt like I was hearing the song for the first time again, but in a completely new and awe-inspiring way.  &quot;Storms&quot; also is presented in a unique version that sounds even more intimate than it's released counterpart. Equally effective are rough takes of &quot;Think About Me,&quot; &quot;Never Make Me Cry,&quot; and of course, Lindsey's tracks, which work as an effective contrast to Stevie and Christine's material.      <br />Highly recommended for any Fleetwood Mac fan -- this is the essential version of 'Tusk.'  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that 'Tango In the Night' and 'Mirage' will get the same special treatment!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The Battle of Los Angeles is Rage Against The Machine's greatest album. It is a definite must have in a CD collection. It is raw an real, it is Rage at their best. Tom Morrelo's guitar playing is crazy. He makes up the greatest riffs I have ever Heard. My advice is to get this. <BR>here are my individual song ratings:<br />1.TESTIFY-(10/10)-Rage's best work in this song. One of my all time Favorites. <br />2.GUERILLA RADIO-(10/10)-I never get sick of this song. Zach's lyrics are off the hook and Tom makes a crazy solo in this one as usual.<br />3.CALM LIKE A BOMB-(10/10)-Another one of their greatest songs. Tom makes an amazing guitar for this one. I especially like Tim's little bass solo in the begining.<br />4.MIC CHECK-(10/10)- I am a guitar player and dont think I will ever figure out the guitar for this song. Tom's Best work.<br />5.SLEEP NOW IN THE FIRE-(10/10)- My favorite song on this album. The video is amazing, my all-time favorite. <br />6.BORN OF A BROKEN MAN-(10/10)-Another classic.This song is a different from the other songs.It's not political, just a straight up rock song.<br />7.BORN AS GHOSTS-(10/10)-Another one of my favorites. Alot of effects on this one too.<br />8.MARIA-(10/10)-This song is awesome. It reminds me of the end of &quot;Freedom&quot;, when Zach is sayin &quot;Freedom, for Maria&quot;.<br />9.VOICE OF THE VOICELESS-(10/10)- I really like Zach's lyrics on this one. Love the intro too. <br />10.NEW MILLENNIUM HOMES-(10/10)- A good solid rage song. Everything in this song goes together well. Well done.<br />11.ASHES IN THE FALL-(10/10)-very good song. Has a cool intro like all the songs on this album. The best part is definitly at the end when hes screaming &quot;Ashes in the Fall&quot;.<br />12.WAR WITHIN A BREATH-(10/10)-Very political song, Another best of the album.
0385335482|4.0|In the tradition of &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; doesn't disappoint.  Rebecca, a financial journalist, is experiencing financial turmoil of her own, having maxed out her credit cards and unable to stop spending.  Add in a romance complete with crossed signals, and a personal revelation at the end, this book is fun from beginning to end.  Rebecca is rather self-indulgant and annoying, but she quickly endears herself to the reader.  Recommended reading for snuggling in front of the fire or toasting on the beach or by the pool. :-)
0684830485|4.0|The book chronicles an American dynamiter's mission to blow up a bridge controlled by Spanish fascists.  The book doesn't focus on the war as a whole but rather on the toll war takes on the people living in it.  The main character, Robert Jordan, bands with a guerilla group of which the war took its toll.  One man once a great fighter has now become a hopeless drunk who's only form of comfort other than the bottle is taking care of horses left behind.  His wife who had been beautiful once now has aged and lost her vivacity.  Another young woman lost her parents in a brutal confrontation with fascist forces and dehumanized in the process.  Hemingway's style of writing was a little too wishy washy but some of his emotional descriptions of the things that happened were intriguing.  Two of the more emotional scenes were some of the characters flashbacks of what they had gone through during the war mainly having to do with killing an enemy and being captured by an enemy.  There have been many stories about war and although war isn't something anyone can be used to this book took a perspective that has been thoroughly explored by today's standards.  At the time the book was written there was a lot of censoring where the word \\"obscenity\\" was substituted hence the book was intended for a wide audience.  During Hemingway's time it is understandable how this book can be grappling to an American audience.  But since then World War II and the Vietnam War have pushed aside this conflict in the minds of Americans with their tales of calamity and loss and pretty much reiterating the themes of Hemingway's book.  This is the reason why a typical American reader may not find pathos for the book.  Maybe if the book talk more about Franco, ideologies and the bigger picture of the context of the war then it may be more interesting to contemporary readers.  But this book still has a story that will be valuable for future generation.  In other words, this is a good book for students.
B00003CXB2|1.0|WERE THERE NO OTHER MOTION PICTURES MADE IN 1962? HOW ON EARTH THIS WON BEST PICTURE IS BEYOND ME. WHAT WAS RUNNER-UP &quot;WATCHING PAINT DRY&quot;? THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE AND SHOULD NEVER BE LISTED WITH THE CLASSICS! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
B000005JA8|1.0|This album was made by a bunch of fake hippies, tootling on instruments they don't know how to play (or don't have the limbs to play, as with the two saxophones at once business), pretending to be ultra-crazy and avant-garde, and laughing all the way to the bank.  An album for chumps who want to pretend that they're crazier than everyone else.  Guess what, mates?  You can keep it.  Listen to this a million times if you want, it won't make you anything more than a buffoon with bad music playing on your stereo.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Axl Rose protested this release, and I can't blame him. Five covers and no Estranged, Nightrain, Rocket Queen or Mr. Brownstone!! However, I do understand that this collection is not a &quot;Best of&quot;, but a &quot;Greatest hits&quot;-CD and features all their most popular singles. 7 out of 14 songs can be categorized as &quot;ballads&quot; or &quot;power ballads&quot;, and few of the songs shows what kind of band Guns N' Roses really were. But, of course, it's a great CD with one of the greatest bands of all time!
0671027573|1.0|I had to write a review of this book because I am so mad that I wasted my time.  Never have a read a book with a more ridiculous plot.  It starts with four women getting together on a Friday night, they write up a list of characteristics of what would make the perfect man. The author wants us to believe so badly that this is hilarious fun, she goes on and on how they were laughing so hard they were falling out of their chairs, tears are streaming down their faces and on and on....(and it's not funny.)  The &quot;List&quot; somehow becomes a national media sensation, which is where this book goes from silly to stupid.  The women are hounded by reporters wanting to do interviews, eventually a psychopath enters the picture and wants to kill these women for writing this list. Dumb, dumb, dumb.  The main character, Jaine Bright falls for her next door neighbor who happens to be a cop and gets involved in the murder investigation.  They have a very brief flirtation, fall into bed and decide to get married, this all happens within a weeks time I think. Save your money and your time and skip this one.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This film was just plan awful. It meandered and wondered through itself to the end. The final peice in which Murry murrmers into his co-star's ear most likely sounded like this. &quot;How did I get myself into this mess?&quot; And I'm not even going to talk about the Oscars. Ehh-shhh! Don't waste your money on this. Rent it if you must, but find something, anything else.
0783225881|4.0|I love this movie!!!!!!!!! You don't have to like baseball to fall in love with it. It's about more than just that. It's about family and love. It's so touching
B00005JN1L|3.0|As I sat in the movie theatre, I kept thinking that this all seemes very familiar and wondered why I kept thinking about the butler from the movie Mr. Deeds. I do agree with other reviewers that this is a very excellent performance by Johnny Depp, but the story line lacked and kept me bored for the first hour and then after the movie was over I compaired it to Fight Club which seemed very similar to this story line. I would not have been afraid to get up to go to the bathroom or get something to eat because I would miss part of the story line. Even though I harp on this, I still found this a decent movie with excellent cast.
B00015YVD6|3.0|&quot;Splash&quot; is one of those totally ridiculous, feel good, charmers from the mid-eighties that asks nothing more from its audience than to maintain its suspended belief in the romance between Joe Everybody (Tom Hanks) and an underwater fantasy creature (Darryl Hannah). John Candy costars as Tom's blithering idiot brother, whose one desire is to see his name published in Penthouse magazine. Ah, ambition! How does it all end? With anyone other than director, Ron Howard, it might have been superficial tripe. But with Howard, Hanks et al, we get a modern day fairy-tale of love on the high seas - unlikely, implausible and thoroughly engaging.<BR>TRANSFER: This DVD is only marginally better than Buena Vista's other release &quot;Ranson&quot;. Though color balancing is generally more solid, colors are still weak and sometimes muddy. Film grain is excessive in several scenes. Black levels are weak. Fine details are lost during darker scenes. Edge enhancement and pixelization crop up now and then but do not terribly distract. Age related nicks, chips and scratches are everywhere.<BR>The audio is Stereo Surround.<BR>EXTRAS: Include a making of featurette, audio commentary and theatrical trailers. Big deal!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of the movie you'll want to add this to your collection. But for anyone else my advice is to swim for shore!
0671027387|3.0|This book was a big disapointment after having read Angels & Demons.  I never cared about any of the characters, never bought the \\"blossoming\\" romance between Rachel and Tolland and Senator Sexton is one of the worst caricatures of the devious Washington politician.  I'm as cynical as the next guy, but, Sexton's actions towards the end of the novel regarding his daughter are just too hard to believe.<br />I will say that there are some real genuine surprises in the book and despite my complaints it did keep me turing the pages.  3 stars ain't all bad.<br />If you are new to Dan Brown I'd read Angels & Demons first.  For my part, I will have to consider whether or not I want to take a chance on Brown's other novels.
0380789035|5.0|This book completely blew me away, right from the beginning.  This wan't the &quot;can't put it down&quot; kind of good book, this was the &quot;put it down but spend the next few hours churning it over in your mind&quot; kind of good book, you cared about the characters right up to the point where they betrayed you, you fell right into the traps Gaiman set and then curse yourself for not seeing it before.  The image of the young girl at the end stayed with me for days after I finished the book, I've never felt anything quite like it.<br />My first brush with Neil Gaiman was in Good Omens with Terry Pratchett and after reading American Gods, it's easy to pick out the Gaiman dark grace of Gaiman from the bubbly but clever humour of Pratchett.  I can't praise American Gods highly enough, it really was an amaising experience.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|For any Michael Bubl fan, this is a MUST have for your CD/DVD collection! The young crooner was followed by a camera crew for his first year touring the world to promote his eponymous album and lets you in on some of his adventures! A fun hour of show clips and a behind-the-scenes look, whether you have seen him perform live or not, you'll love it!
B00015YVDG|2.0|&quot;Ransom&quot; is the taut thriller about one man's desperation and determination to get back his kidnapped son. Mel Gibson headlines as Tom Mullen - a man whose seemingly perfect world is shattered when his son, Sean (Brawley Nolte) is stolen from him during a science fair in Central Park. Rene Russo, Gary Sinise and Lily Taylor add genuine weight to their roles. As far as suspence and deception go - they don't get much better than &quot;Ranson&quot;.<BR>TRANSFER: Unfortunately, no one at Touchstone seems to care. The quality of this transfer is, pending a few truly horrific digital transfers that I have seen in my life time, really nothing to get worked up about. This DVD is NOT ANAMORPHICALLY ENHANCED for 16:9 displays. Colors are generally weak and often muddy and on occasion tend to bleed. Fine detail is completely lost in the darker scenes and contrast levels are way, way too low. Black levels register as more of a dirty brown than black. Aliasing, shimmering of fine details and edge enhancement are all present for a very uneven visual presentation. There is NO EXCUSE for the barrage of &quot;age related&quot; nicks, chips and scratches that are all over this visual presentation. Some films from the 1950s don't look this bad!!! The audio is Stereo Surround. Apart from the extras, this is virtually the same DVD as previously released by Buena Vista. What a crock! <BR>EXTRAS: Deleted scenes, an audio commentary, a really brief making of featurette and the original theatrical trailer.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: If this is Buena Vista's idea of a Special Edition I'd hate to see what their idea of bare bones is. Oops! Almost forget. I have seen it on &quot;Beaches&quot;, &quot;I Love Trouble&quot;, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Adventures In Babysitting&quot;...
0784010501|5.0|This is Madonna at her best.  Anyone who has growen up with her music will appreciate this movie.  I watch it every so often and not only does it bring back happy times, it's an excellent documentry of what it's like t be rich and very famous.  Even if you don't have a liking for Madonna, I find it hard to beleive that you would not at least have a better respect for her after watching this DVD.  This will always be on the living room DVD case!
0385504209|2.0|This badly informed book would have been less annoying if the author had avoided such outdated stereotypes as the supposed role of 'the Inquisition' in persecuting witches, or conspiracy-theory-type accounts of imaginary secret Christian societies and mysteries. This is all so derivative, and so wrong, and so boring.<br />I don't care if historical novels are inaccurate--after all, they are not MEANT to be accurate, they are meant to be entertaining, and this book succeeds on that score. But I do care when heavily biased and badly outdated scholarship informs a novelist's view of the past--such as the nonsense about 'the Inquisition' persecuting witches. Dozens of good books on the history of witch-hunting have been published over the last three decades, and looking at one or two, instead of an older encyclopedia or Western Civ. textbook, might have pushed the author to avoid this old (Protestant) slur. The Catholic Church per se had little to do with witch-hunting, though many individual churchmen (and Protestants too, BTW) were guilty of all kinds of nasty things. I should also mention that a substantial portion of those persecuted as witches were men--in some parts of Europe, they were the majority of 'witches'! Anyone interested in this can read more in Andrew Gow and Lara Apps, Male Witches in Early Modern Europe (Manchester University Press, 2003).<br />It'll be clear enough by now that I am a professor of history. However, I am not a Christian of any kind, so I don't have a particular warm spot for Rome--I'd just like to see less in the way of outdated views and vicious bias in books like this.
B000001FS3|5.0|You can't go wrong with anything U2, but Joshua Tree is by far their best overall album, with such classics as &quot;With or Without You,&quot; &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name,&quot; and &quot;Bullet in the Blue Sky,&quot; among others.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This album made me a Johnny Cash fan. Never has someone's voice touched me the way his does. There's something about the way he sings that draws you in. Incidentally, the first song I heard by him was Hurt. I had never heard the song before, but knew it must be good because it makes the hairs on your neck stand up. He sings with such emotion. I especially love Desperado. Don Henley on the background helps it out. Too bad Johnny Cash passed away. He had a long career, and would have continued to have an excellent career if he had lived. Country music lost a great singer with his passsing. I'd definitely recommend to friends.
B000000ORX|5.0|Some people think that great, artistic pop essentially died with disco.  This album negates such thought as an absolute assertion; it deserves to be regarded in history as one of the very best non-classical albums of the last quarter of the 20th century.  The lyrics to songs such as \\"Come in from the Cold\\" and \\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\\" are tremendously arresting and thought-provoking, simply as poetry; and the gorgeous harmonies and Wayne Shorter sax will make you forget that \\"Cherokee Louise\\" is about the terrible subject of child sex abuse, and \\"The Windfall\\" about a civil litigation system out of control (really, a great theme song for insurance companies who want legislatures to restrict the ability of victims of medical malpractice to recover.  The point being:  as politics, this is garbage; but as art, which is what we're reviewing here, it's interesting.  Actually, it enhances the overall mood of the album, which is like a walk in a gloomy, humid rain forest, with foreboding lurking around the corner.).  Joni Mitchell has always been regarded as a great lyricist above all, and a pioneer for such artists as Tori Amos, Ani DeFranco and Alanis Morrissette.  Here, she is the master of that universe.
B000063JZQ|3.0|Roman Planski did a generally good job at portraying macbeth as a film. I understand that the movie was made in the 1970's so it was kinda bad quality and some scenes were poorly made, for example the scene with the floating dagger and the fight scene at the end between Macbeth and Macduff. It kind of ruined my idea of it. But nonetheless it was an alright movie. I really enjoyed how Polanski showed the witches, and the added scene at the very end where it shows Donald Bain going to visit the witches, leaving that bit of open interpretation. It was an interesting way to end it.
0385504209|4.0|Reading the reviews of The Da Vinci Code has been almost entertaining as reading the book.  However, it's troubling to read the comments from reviewers insulting those who enjoyed the book. As we all have something in common (we actually read books), can't we agree to disagree?<br />Much of the vitriol directed at the book can be divided into two camps:  1) those who think Brown's research is either suspect or based on a heretic viewpoint, and 2) those who think Brown is a terrible writer.  As a reviewer pointed out, if a book makes a person think and want to research its ideas further, then that piece of literature has merit. As E.L. Doctorow wrote in his essay The Importance of Fiction, &quot;Fiction is democratic; it reasserts the authority of the single mind to make and remake the world&quot; (1986).<br />To be sure, Brown is no Hemingway, Faulkner or even Stephen King.  He is a creative writer who has created a thought-proking thriller.  The best advice/recommendation is to read the book and form your own opinion.
B000063JZQ|3.0|Roman Palanski did a generally good job at portraying macbeth as a film. I understand that the movie was made in the 70's so it isn't the best quality. Some scenes were poorly made for example when Macbeth sees the floating dagger infront of him, and the fight scene between Macduff and Macbeth at the end was quite disapointing because it kind of ruin my idea of it. But nonetheless it was an alright movie. I really enjoyed how Palanski showed the witches, and at the very end of the movie, when he added that last scene where you see Donald Bain going to see the witches, ending it with that bit of open interpretation. It was interesting how he did it.
630469878X|5.0|&quot;Thelma And Louise&quot; is one of the most memorable and one of the best films of 1991.  This Oscar-winning film takes audiences on a journey into a road trip that takes an unplanned turn.  Once Thelma (Geena Davis) has a close encounter with a rapist, their lives change forever.  After Louise (Susan Sarandon) kills the rapist, the action starts and never stops until the film's end.  The plot was written brilliantly.  They combine comedy, drama, and action wonderfully.  Their run from the law offers audiences many twists and turns as they encounter unpleasant visiters.  The intensity keeps audiences guessing their next move in every scene.  Only one other fugitive film comes close to the quality of &quot;Thelma And Louise&quot;: &quot;Bonnie And Clyde&quot;.  However, no other film released before, during, and after matches the uniqueness.  Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon add their own sense of theme in their Oscar-nominated roles for Best Actress.  Their words and emotions are flawless from their Texas accent to their intense life struggles.  All other actors perform their roles beautifully, including the then-unknown Brad Pitt.  &quot;Thelma And Louise&quot; is a great film for those looking for a great action drama.  This unforgettable experience is sure to continue pleasing audience for many more years.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|Every menu option comes with a long intro. You can't skip the previews. It's ridiculous. Don't encourage such arrogance by buying it. (Sorry, Jessica -- I'm a huge fan.)
B00008H2LB|3.0|This is just a rip-off from their first album Hybrid theory. HT had a new sound and every song was diverse enough to be good, but the songs on Meteora are either a rip-off of the HT ones or very uninspirated. Hope to see more original stuff in their next albums.
B00013F38K|5.0|Easily one of the greatest and most influential TV shows of all time, Kung Fu looks beautiful and right at home on these DVD's. The picture quality is superb, the menus easy to navigate, and the extra features are fascinating. And it comes in a very handsome package. The show itself has no peer in the history of television. It's uniqueness is dazzling even to this day. I highly recommended these DVD's and think all fans of the show will treasure them. I know I will.
B00008NV4I|4.0|As to what Egads has said he is totally full of it. He or she for got to mention that the ENTERPRISE had help on firing on the Remans ship. The Romulan came to the aid of the ENTERPRISE and help them out and did some of the damage too. So before you write a review buddy write down what really happened and the  ENTERPRISE did not just fire 3 times they hit the with phasers and torpedoes and with the new  QUTEM TORPEDOS too. So maybe you should go see this movie again and write a much better review. This might not have ben the best STAR TREK movie but the action is really good and even though a lot of the good seans were cut. I am sure they will bring another  STAR TREK movie back becasue dont for get there is always &quot;Q&quot;. Even if he was in the  FINAL show of STAR TREK he too was a good villin for PICARD. I hope they mack a movie with the cast of  VOYAGER, some time soon.
6305736650|2.0|I may be the only one that thinks so, but Casablanca was a big dissapointment to me. I am a classic movie buff and have almost all the great ones, but this was so boring and Humphrey Bogart has no romantic appeal and no chemistry with Ingrid Bergman. I think this movie is known more for it's one-liners than the fact that it's a &quot;good movie&quot;.  I think the movie came out at a time when it was embraced because of world circumstances, but there have been many movies after it that blow it away.
0767805712|5.0|One can tell a lot about a person by their reaction to Gattaca.  (1) It was a commercial dud, so few will know what you're talking about, and (2) Most people don't see it for what it is. There's just not enough life here - at least not at the surface.  For that 4% of us who do enjoy this movie, we belong to a distinct tribe, and we recognize in this flick a certain kind of intellectual philosophical adventure which is rare and powerful.  <br />I liked this film. It's one of the very few successful deep sci-fi films ever, and it's more impressive to me because they did it with no budget and without distracting toys. This film is an adult thought-experiment, making a statement about a number of related issues regarding genetics, social engineering and the nature of the self.  <br />Personally, I think a variation of Gattaca's future-dystopia will be realized someday - maybe not in our lifetimes, but still - the Darwinian forces that would cause Gattaca are real, and they will effect the real future in one way or another. Passing laws against this 'progress' would be like outlawing the motions of the planets. They don't respond to judicial sanction.<br />So this film has a ring of premonition in my mind. Maybe in a hundred years after the world has changed, someone will watch Gattaca and will see that at least we had our eyes wide open as we walked off that genetic cliff.  C'est la vie.

B000005JA8|1.0|I've tried, honestly I really did give this album a chance, but 95% of the sounds on it are just not music. Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but to me (seemingly) random sounds are not music. I like albums that take a few listens before the magic starts to shine through, but I can really see no merit in this. Ever heard the story of the Emporer's New Clothes? Stop pretending to like this to appear knowledgable and hip.<br />(...)
B000089RVX|5.0|I've literally fallen in love with \\"Fallen.\\"<br />Every - and I mean, every - song that Evanescence has in this album literally captivates me with such divine gothic beauty, it fazes me like the many directions of a never-ending maze. Each song holds a different lingering touch that it keeps me in place, as time slowly passes me by. Amy Lee's voice is so enchanting, in a matter of time, you'll find yourself \\"going under\\" her spell. Ben Moody, as well as the rest of the Evanescence band, plays each song with definite meaning that you will find your head moving with the music.<br />1) \\"Going Under\\" - 10/10<BR>2) \\"Bring Me to Life\\" - 9/10<BR>3) \\"Everybody's Fool\\" - 10/10<BR>4) \\"My Immortal\\" - 10/10<BR>5) \\"Haunted\\" - 9/10<BR>6) \\"Tourniquet\\" - 10/10<BR>7) \\"Imaginary\\" - 9/10<BR>8) \\"Taking Over Me\\" - 10/10<BR>9) \\"Hello\\" - 10/10<BR>10) \\"My Last Breath\\" - 9/10<BR>11) \\"Whisper\\" - 9/10<br />Needless to say, I'm in love with every song that is included in \\"Fallen.\\" I'm not a goth, but who needs to be a certain kind of something, in order to listen to a certain kind of music?
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is up there on my favorite albums.  I know lots of fans of Radiohead who prefer their &quot;The Bends&quot; era work, but in my opinion, their work seems to be getting better and better.<br />I understand that everyone's not into Radiohead; I recommend this Album to people who are open to experimental music, which explores new song structures, strange harmonies, odd time signatures, complex orchestral-like arrangements,and enjoy a good sound production nearly as much as the music itself.<br />The band endeavors in fusing guitar-driven music with electronic music again.  Unlike albums like Kid A, however, Hail to the Thief is less flowing from one song to the next.  It seems to be an album jumping from one theme to the next with little in common.  Some see this as a fault in Hail to the Thief, but I believe it is surpassed by the strength of the songs.<br />My favorite aspects of Radiohead songs which are especially present on Hail to the Thief are those which have two basic parts: the beginning which builds up a soft but pressing tension, and the end which releases like an explosion.<br />My favorite songs on the album are:<BR>1) 2+2=5<BR>2) Sit down, Stand up<BR>3) Sail to the Moon<BR>4) Where I End and You Begin<BR>5) We Suck Young Blood<BR>6) There, There<BR>7) Myxomatosis<br />I highly recommend this album, and it is well worth checking out if you're tired of the predictable music that is out there.
B000002MTU|2.0|E'C's love off the blues is obvious. And his willingness to &quot;tribute&quot; the originators is commendable. But these &quot;faithful&quot; renditions do not offer anything new aside from modern production. What is most troubling is that middle american &quot;white&quot; folks are treating this as though it's a work of genius. Does E.C. make blues &quot;safe for white people?&quot; It's a sad commentary on Clapton's audience.  If you go to the source(s) you will discover that there is no substitute for the real thing. E.C. has no soul. His versions are stiff, stuffy and tight sphincter by comparison. If you must have your blues served up by a white guy. Try Robben Ford, Ronnie Earl or Paul Rishell. Or better yet, If you like the old classics go to the originals. E.C. is a bore.
B00018D44U|5.0|The first time I heard Norah Jones was from a little 30 second snippet online of her first video from her first album. I was hooked, and immediately grabbed my keys and went to my nearest record store to buy it. I really enjoyed her first album, and this one is just as good. The song with Dolly Parton is really fun and cute.
B000002LCK|5.0|If Substance wasn't a greatest hits collection, it would have been one of the ten greatest albums of all time. And when you hear the first notes of Ceremony, you just know you're in for a long-time New Order cession.<BR>If, like me, you're twenty-something, you might at first sight be disturbed by the sound of New Order, wich was mostly designed for dance floors. But those songs are so wonderful you should quickky get used to them. I once played &quot;Subculture&quot; to your casual Nirvana/Smashing Pumkins fan who was saying how much the 80s suck and all. He just shut up and said, &quot;It's beautiful&quot;.<BR>Substance is one of those CDs, like Daydream Nation or Ok Computer, that are truly unique. Everything seems so different when you listen to it... Everything around you becomes magic and magnificent. I know I sound like a freakin idiot but it's just THAT good. Substance will make you shivers in awe and leave you jaws wide open.
B000067J1H|4.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites and has the best one liners I ever heard. I am Jack's raging bile duct.Awesome in it's scope and unflinching under scrutiny,Fight Club simply is a treat for the scores of burned out consumers to hemmed up by all the bs to do something about it.Escapeism at its best!!!The only reason I deducted one star was for the main charecters flip flop in the end.
B0000027RL|4.0|This CD Rocks and is one of the best CDs of all time.<BR>Enough said.<BR>The only criticism is of the photo of the band on the Album cover who are wearing some of the most atrocious clothes I have ever seen.<BR>Pearl Jam don't have another CD that matches up to this.<BR>So get it.
B00000J7SS|5.0|..but it's still quite interesting. While I am a Miles Davis FREAK, I'm not a huge fan of either his fusion stuff OR free jazz in general... yet I still find myself drawn to this one. <br />I do agree with those who say CD 1 is weaker... both tunes meander a bit, and Miles's presence isn't as strong. But he makes up for it on the second one. Spanish Key and Miles Runs The Voodoo Down in particular have excellent grooves to them, the playing by Miles and crew is understated yet first-rate, and the editing by Teo Macero throughout is spot-on. (Don't believe me? Listen to the Complete Sessions CD's, and you'll wonder 'how did they pull this crap into an album?')<br />Í'd only recommend two of his subsequent fusion CD's (Live-Evil and Jack Johnson), and I go to this one more than both of those combined. Maybe it's because when I listen to it, I can hear a musical wall being torn down.
B000002AZ8|4.0|Yep, this is good, Pearl Jam could of really made this Album into something alot bigger if it had the instumental tracks dropped, a few more tuneful rocking songs thrown in and made it good enough to listen to from start to finish, instead they did'nt.<BR>It could of Been Pearl Jams best - raw, hard hard grunge all the way through but it aint, but most of it is, the majority of songs are excellent, except for Bugs and Satans Bed.
B000002UE9|5.0|Poison's second album Open Up and Say Ahh!is 80's hair metal at it's very best.Besides the obivious hit single the power ballad Every Rose Has it's Thorn,the album contains the great feel good anthem Nothin but a Good Time.These two songs are not the only worthwhile tracks on the album.Everything in between the opener Love on the Rocks and Bad to Be Good is excellent.Check out the awesome cover of Loggins and Messina's Your Mama Don't Dance.If you are new to Poison get this album instead of the greatest hits.I notice this album has gone out of print,Capital records better be remastering it,to be reissued.
B000002BFZ|4.0|This is Pearl Jams first experimental album, apart from some tracks off Vitolagy.<BR>While this album rocks and is good, it also has some songs that don't suit Pearl Jam.<BR>Around The Bend, and Smile are'nt suited to what this band should sound like.<BR>Also they should have chucked the piano out on Off He Goes!!!<BR>Quite a few good songs though, Mankind is very good.
B00005YUTD|4.0|We bought this video and all of the other Baby Einstein DVDs when out daughter was about 2 months old.  She absolutely loves Baby Bach.  She's 10 months now and it is harder to hold her attention.  But for the past 8 months, if we played that DVD, she'd stop what she was doing and be glued to the video.  She becomes bored with the still pictures of the toys and the children playing.  She loves the music of Bach.  We purchased Baby Beethoven also, but Baby Bach is still her favorite.  We're starting on all the other videos now, she really likes the puppets.  We purchased those for her, they are a little disappointing compared to the fancier ones in the video, but she likes them anyway.  Baby Einstein is a good purchase.  I highly recommend the DVDs.
B0000028UK|4.0|This CD is good, very good.<BR>But some of the songs could of been a bit more straight forward like the songs of Vitolagy, as it would of been an easier listen all the way through.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|First off, I have to agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out that this is a Greatest Hits album, not a &quot;best of&quot;...which is certainly the reason for the disppointing length of this CD. Another reason that this CD is so short is the fact that G'n'R didn't really produce very many original songs. The &quot;Lies&quot; album shouldn't be considered as anything more than an LP, and &quot;Spaghetti&quot; was just intended as a time-filler between new albums (we all know what happened to the band after that). Axl Rose has made a few attempts at getting something together in the past several years, with the alleged &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; album, a horrendous cut on the &quot;End Of Days&quot; soundtrack, and a less-than-memorable appearance on MTV where his gut took center stage. Still, it has always been all about Axl, not about the fans or the band-mates, so waiting for something new from G'n'R has been nothing but a tease while the band's stock continues to plummet into the depths of &quot;where are they now?&quot;s. The Greatest Hits album is a tease as well; most Guns fans already have all of their albums, and there are no true extras on this compilation, so what is the point? Not to make money...because that could have been done by remastering and repackaging all of the original albums (see &quot;Ozzy Osbourne&quot;). The real point of this is to test the market to find out how much of an actual demand there is for anything Guns N'Roses in this day and age. If &quot;Greatest&quot; gets to number one in the U.S., a reunion of the band is probably inevitable. And that is what we fans want, and what we demand! Otherwise Axl can forget it, because we're not going to stand for some Van Halen-esque hybrid, right? So if you already have all of G'n'R's albums, their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album will give you nothing new. Buying it will be nothing more than a trip down memory lane, and a vote that says &quot;we want you back!&quot;. It can't hurt...we're all plenty used to disappointment by now.
0385720920|2.0|\\"Choke\\" is a novel about completion: protagonist Victor Mancini attempts to complete the lives of others as well as his own. He plays a sort of savior to people, giving them a reason to be by faking choking in restaurants and having random people rescue him. This is a very interesting concept for a novel. Unfortunately, it's as though Pahlaniuk tried to cram every other intersesting novel concept into \\"Choke\\", essentially making it seem unrealistic and written ad lib. <BR>    When i read the plot synopsis on back of the book, i was lead to believe that the story would focus on Victor's seemingly interesting choking prank, and i trusted Pahlaniuk would put a smart spin on it as he did in \\"Fight Club\\", the other Pahlaniuk novel i have read. However, the novel is full of crude sexual descriptions and troubling concepts. Victor's dialogues are far too simplistic and peppered with juvenile slang to be coming from a med-student. Victor's twisted childhood, which is recounted through a series of scattered chapters, also seems somewhat outlandish. Pahlaniuk has a sort of conspiracy theory that he convey's in both \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"Choke\\", a theory that everyone everywhere is doing something secret and forbidden. He pulls it off very well in \\"Fight Club\\", but rather poorly in \\"Choke\\". Victor works at a colonial theme-park where supposedly everyone is doing drugs and fornicating, a completely unrealistic and vulgar concept. Not to spoil too much of the plot for potential readers, the most disturbing plotline involves Victor's relationship to Jesus Christ. All of these useless aspects distract the reader from an interesting theme, instead of enhancing it. <BR>     In conclusion, \\"Choke\\" dissapointed more than it pleased. Pahlaniuk's wit and intelligence were sadly overshadowed by his perverted side. \\"Choke\\" could have been so much more.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I know a lot of people say they don't like this CD--but I do! I've never really been much of a Britney fan, thinking she didn't have any talent, but this CD proves me wrong!!<br />Me Against the Music- 5/5. Great song! I love the beat of it, and just dancing around to it! I do think the song would have been better without Madonna though.<BR>I Got that Boom Boom- 4/5. Probably my least favorite song on the album. I don't really like the Ying Yang twins in this song--it gets repetitive. <br />Showdown-4/5. I didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me after 5+ listens. Great beat!!<BR>Breathe on Me- 4.5/5. Wow, great song!! This could definitely be a club hit. <BR>Early Mornin-4/5. Good song. It doesn't really fit in with the whole CD, but its a good song nevertheless.<BR>Toxic- 5/5. One of Britney's best ever. The music is just incredible! I love the lyrics, and the song is extremely catchy! I find myself singing it in the shower without realizing.<BR>Outrageous-4.5/5. Good song, I especially like the lyrics. The beats amazing!!<BR>Touch of my Hand- 5/5. I love the music, and Brit's voice goes great with the song! One of my favorite songs on the CD, and all time.<BR>The Hook Up-4.5/5. I'd dance to this in a club. Like all of the songs, it has great music, and Brit sings especially well. <BR>Shadow- 5/5. I LOVE THIS SONG!! It's a great ballad, and Brit proves she CAN sing. The chorus is especially good.<BR>Brave New Girl-5/5. Wow. This is an amazing song!! Probably my favorite song on the album. <BR>Everytime- 5/5. Beautiful ballad that Brit wrote herself. It's probably my favorite ballad of all time--it's just so beautiful! It has a sad element that makes you want to cry.<BR>Me Against the Music (Remix)- 4.5/5. I liked the original song better, but this is still good.<br />In conclusion, listening to 30 second samples of the songs doesn't do this CD justice. You have to buy it and listen to it a few times to really understand it, and love it. I think this is Britney's best album, and a must buy. And believe me, I'm not a Britney fanatic--I don't like some of the things she does or wears, but I DO like her music.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Once something peaks, there is no where to go; a problem being no real depth to the singing voices.  They are all good voices, mind you, they just run out of room quickly (QueenL of course rocks).<br />But it is just an overall lack of building as the movie progresses...it all unfolds and is revealed right away (on a sight and sound level), so there is just  nowhere to go dynamically.<br />Juxtaposing tragedy, and a song about tragedy, in a wildly entertaining performance is a very cool trippy idea.<br />The story itself just seems too trite and trodden.
076790592X|4.0|We all are busy living our lives and we often forget what we need to do to build a life filled with rewards and happiness.  Tuesdays With Morrie shares a personal relationship between a teacher and a student that extends far beyond academics and a few years in a classroom. It reminds us how important relationships with friends and family are and encourages us to reach out and build these relationships throughout our lives. <BR>By the end of this book, we understand that the riches we are looking for are found in people not things, with the exception of this book. It is a treasure worth having.
0385504209|5.0|...But you can believe the research.  There are many publications out on the market explaining the true roll of Mary Magdalene, the WIFE of Christ, and each one is countered by a book that goes against it.  So it is all up to the reader to believe or not believe.  I mean, we can't ask Jesus or Mary, can we?  But just because you may not believe in what Dan Brown suggests in this book, doesn't make it automatically false, AND VICE-VERSA.  It's all up to the individual reader to decide, but all I ask is that once you make up your mind, keep your opinion to yourself.  Let others form their own opinion, and challenge their faith at will.  Their faith is not for you to control.  Live your life how you want to, but don't tell me what I can believe and what I can't.<br />Now, Dan Brown decided to use the artwork of DaVinci in his novel.  The same principles apply here as up above.  There is no way for us to go and ask DaVinci himself, so even the ART HISTORIANS will NEVER KNOW 100% what was meant to be in his artwork and what wasn't.  And the same goes for any other artist now deceased.  Because of this, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WE BELIEVE.  And what you believe may not be what I believe.  So leave me alone.<br />As far as the story goes, It's a page turner.  Whether you acknowledge the research, or are tooooo close minded to even consider it a possibility, you have to agree.  It may not be accurate, but the story keeps moving at a fast pace that keeps any reader interested if they are reading for the story and not for the facts.  The one thing I didn't appreciate is that the begining of the story is almost a clone of &quot;Angels &amp; Demons.&quot;  Anyone who read that book and this should know what I mean.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Well, my wonderful wife made me watch this\\"musical\\" with her, she knows I hate musicals and boy, do I ever hate this piece of trash! people just don't sing and dance in the streets, garages, mayor's offices, funeral parlors......know what I mean?  How in the world this won ANY Oscar is beyond me! best picture? not even close by acountry mile! songs? they all sound alike! all musicals seem to be written in avery narrow band of chords, this one is right there! the stars? well Zeta was kinda easy on the eyes. If I could have rated this one a -2 or -3, I would have jumped on it! A royal TURKEY!
B000002TPS|5.0|this album is masterpiece<br />mature lyrics, great riff great solos, melodic ,.... great at everthing
B00018D44U|2.0|Excuse me! Who are we trying to kid here, people? Don't tell me you enjoy this utter boredom! Her first album was already boring and I never really understood why she got 8 Grammys. Shows you that te Grammys have no value whatsoever. Ok, Ok, she was a new voice on the palette, but it was a boring voice, nice but boring. You couldn't listen to the whole album at once without wanting to kill yourself. Don't lie to yourself! You know it's true and you felt the same way.<BR>This is just as boring as the first one if not more boring. The only enjoyable tune is the duet with Dolly Parton, and it's enjoyable because of Dolly and not Norah. Don't get me wrong! I HATE country music! But on this album that's the only tune that kind of raises your interest level a little bit. I love Tom Waits, but she really doesn't do justice to the Tom Waits song, either. I don't believe that you can or want to be in a mood to listen to this album. There are so much better melancholy albums to listen to that are not boring. Melancholy doesn't have to be boring. <BR>I am very dissapointed. She could have some potential, but she's not using it the right way. Her song on other peoples' albums, like on the Wax Poetic album is at least interesting, due to the music, though. She really should make a little more uptempo album if she wants to stay popular. <BR>I would suggest people to buy the Wax Poetic album or the Adam Levy album instead. Much better music and will not make you fall asleep or want to kill yourself.
B000002BSV|5.0|I love this album!<BR>And I'm sure everyone in this world will love Suede and this album!<br />Trash - This is a strong opening track! Fast-Tempo, Vigorous, I really love the chrous! 5/5<br />Filmstar - Just an incredible song! 5/5<br />Lazy - Suede make a song for the feel of Lazy and it's really Great too! 5/5<br />By The Sea - Very nice ballad! Suede can melt everyone with their always great ballad songs! 5/5<br />She - The only song I don't like in this album 3/5<br />Beautiful Ones - Enough to say, it's one of their most familiar song! It's a very nice song, easy listening and catchy as hell, even my mum love this song too! 5/5<br />Starcrazy - Not a stand out song, but still very nice! 4/5<br />Picnic by the Motorway - Psychedelic!!! 4/5<br />The Chemistry Between Us - My Favorite Song in this album! 7mins Epic Ballad, there have no word to describe this song, just go and listen it! 5/5<br />Saturday Night - This song should be one of the Suede very best song! A Depress ballad, Must Listen1 5/5<br />Just go GET IT NOW!
0060930187|5.0|It may or may not be the female version of Catcher in the Rye, but definitely a classic. After I read this book, it took me a while to figure out how much this book affected me. The book may seem strange in the way it is written. The plot seems flat at certain parts or unbelievable, but the reader should keep in mind that this book is based strongly on Sylvia Plath's life. Although not everybody will be affected by the book or will relate, it is definitely an important book to read. If a person really wants to get into the book (look past what's on the pages), I strongly suggest you read more about Sylvia Plath's life and read her poetry. You'll feel more connected to what's going on and understand more what she was going through.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought \\"Stripped\\" about one year ago and I still like it as much now as I did then. Unlike other albums that I have I don't have to skip tracks listening to it, because they are all great!  I never really been a big fan of Christina until this album came out, but now I defietly am. Her voice is amazing and she has some serious songwriting skills.   The music style is really wide on this album and that is great.  This is my review track by track:  1. Stripped- An really cool intro, this is a good way to start the album. 10 of 10  2. Can't hold us down- I love the lyrics to this song and the beat is good. An real female empowering song. I love it.  10 of 10.  3. Walk away- A ballad, her voice is amazing on this song,so emotional, love the lyrics and music. 10 of 10.  4. Fighter- A really good rock song, the melody, the lyrics, her voice, the guitarriff. It all fits together. And the video is awesome. 10 of 10.  5.Primer amor- a good intro to the following song. It's nice to listen to a little spanish.   6. Infatuation- a latino inspired track about her first love.  It's kind of catchy, I like it. 8 of 10.  7. Loves embrace, a beautiful interlude  8. Loving me 4 me- not one of my favourites, but still a good love song. 7 of 10.  9. Impossible- I like Alicia Keys and I think she has done a good job on this one and Christinas voice is as always great.  9 of 10.  10. Underapprechiated- not one of the best, but with a funky tune. 8 of 10.  11. Beautiful- This song is amazing! It has a great message and a deep meaning. 10 of 10.  12.Make over- rockinspired. I love it, I think it's cool and different. 10 of 10.  13. Cruz- a good ballad with some rock influences, really beautiful. 9 of 10.  14. Soar- this lyrics are really inspiring, the production isn't the greatest but Chrstinas voice makes it better. 8 of 10.  15.Get mine, get yours- (...)the melody and production is really good. 8,5 of 10.  16. Dirrty- a really controversial song, it's a party song and a good one. 9 of10.  17. Stripped 2- a following to the intro. Great lyrics and beat.  18. The voice within- a really beautiful ballad with inspiring lyrics. 8 of 10  19. I'm Ok- not one of the best song vocally, but the lyrics are just so deep and touching. I think it was really brave of her to write and sing this song. 9 of 10.  20. Keep on singing my song- Great lyrics, good ending of the album 8 of 10.  Highly recommended, buy it now!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is a wonderful album! I recommend it to anyone. No matter what style of music you like this is the album for you! Cornell's voice is amazing!! In my opinion the Best songs on the album are Like A Stone, Shadow of the Sun, and I Am The Highway.All of them are great however!
B00000AFWW|5.0|&quot;celebrity skin&quot; is a masterpiece. some speculate that they ahve &quot;sold out&quot; because &quot;celebrity skin&quot; isn't the angry fireball that was &quot;pretty on the inside&quot; &amp; &quot;live tough this&quot; i completely disagree. every song on this alabam shines. 7 even if you are someone who thinks this albam is popish sounding, you must addmitt that lyricly, skin is amazing. from the haunting &quot;northern star&quot; to the uppity &quot;heaven tonight&quot; it is all great. my favorites would be &quot;reasons to be beautiful&quot; &quot;playing your song&quot; &quot;use once &amp; destory&quot; &quot;malibu&quot;...oh hell, they're all great i can't pick a favorite.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Man!!!  There's a lot of bashing reviews for this movie.  My review is it's a good movie.  Why do you think so many people bashed this movie? Well it's because they put there hopes on this movie too high on the pedistal.  Yes the movie it sort of short and it doesn't really show hardly of what happened in the past, like the dragons burning down cities and eating people, but it had awesome visuals, great acting and a good story.  Mathew played a wicked role and played it great!!!  I didn't even think it was him acting because I haven't seen him so taugh.  <BR>Trust me, there was a lot of work put in this movie.  It took two years to finish it.  Yes there could have been more dragons and they should of shown more of what happened in the past, but it still turned out great.  Out of all the dragans movies out there, this on is on top.  GO BUY THE MOVIE
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I saw this movie at the theatre.  It was the biggest disapointment I have had since Highlander 2.  Despite the nonstop action I was bored.  It seems hard to believe that the amazingly new and fresh Matrix could have devolved into this tired waste of time.  Better editing on the second film could have made this movie unecessary, instead it is mostly special effects filler for about 15 minutes of substance.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Guns n' Roses is one of the best bands ever and it is tough to narrow it down to 14 songs.. But who's idea was it to put Aint it fun, Live and Let die, Since I don't have you... etc? Who's idea was it to put 5 cover songs on a best of album? Five!
B0000TLA9G|3.0|This is a great CD for fans whose only connection will GNR is their more commercial releases.  All the songs you heard and enjoyed on MTV or on movie soundtracks is here.  This suits me, but hardcore GNR fans will be upset that their grittiest songs (diehards say the best) songs are absent. This is true. However, you are still getting all of their most famous songs--the one's you most remember.  If all you remember of GNR is Sweet Child of Mine or November rain, this is for you.<br />If not, all you can do is lament what once was one of the greatest metal bands ever, and will likely never be again.
0440180295|5.0|More than a simple satire Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is one of the most important books written in the North America in the 20 Century. Dealing with both personal experiences, fiction and introducing himself as a character, the writer has created a unique work that will remain in the literary cannon forever.<br />It is hard to tell what this novel is about, because it is sometimes funny, sometimes a sci-fiction, and sometimes very very sad. By using such device, Vonnegut shows the reader the absurdity of the war and of the 20 century as well. Death and life are side by side in his words. At the same time, the novel is a personal journey towards the center of himself.<br />Using a fragmented prose only enhances the experience of reading this novel. With such technique, the book requires more attention from the reader, and increases the curiosity of what will happen next, and when this part of the narrative will be resumed. This is one reason why many readers find Vonnegut's work stranger than the average writer. So he is, but in a good way. This elliptic narrative is very sophisticated and beautiful to those who read a book and care about language, character development and plot.<br />Vonnegut's sense of humor and sarcasm are brilliant turning what could be a tacky story into a deep work, filled with undertones and, psychological and political ideas. The constant use of the sentence `So it goes' display a high level of sophistication, that many veteran writers will never acquire.<br />All in all, `Slaughterhouse-Five' is an important read for everyone who is interested in good and profound books. Those works that make us care more about the world we live, the society we are building everyday and, above all, the life we are leading.
B0000CFW87|5.0|...and I thought I loved his first CD!  This CD hasn't left my player since I bought it, and I love it more and more every time I hear it.  Josh is not only brilliantly gifted but also chooses gorgeous songs to complement his incredible voice.  My personal favorites, #'s 4,10,12 are the best in my humble opinion.  You know it's a good CD when you have memorized songs sung in a different language perfectly and can sing them without music...I love Josh Groban and this is a perfect sophomore album for him!  Can't wait for the next one!
B000002KYR|4.0|Eleminator, wow what a great album, the last good ZZ Top album for like 10 years though! You know who I blame for that, MTV, they killed so many good bands and made so many killer rock bands go soft! This could have been a five star album had it not been so MTV. But they must have done something right because I think this was their biggest selling album ever.<br />All the hits off this album 'Gimme All Your Lovin' 'Got Me Under Pressure' 'Sharp Dressed Man' and 'Legs' are all killer songs but there are other good songs on the album as well. Of all the songs that are not hits 'TV Dinners' is my favorite. 'I Need You Tonight' is a sweet little ballady type sympathtic song with some killer guitar.<br />This is a killer rock album that could have been better had it not been so synthed out and poppy, but over all this is one of ZZ Top's best albums.

B000002ITW|4.0|4 Way street is an exelent live album by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, but it can get kinda worn in places, but thats what you can expect from an album that was recorded nearly thirty years ago.<br />All the songs are performed pretty well, and none of the performances are bad at all but 'Love The One Your With' is so much better when its the studio version, but this one isnt bad its just personal taste. I feel the same about 'Carry On' its great and all but doesnt sound the same live. I also understand that you cant expect this to be perfect since it is live but what are you gonna do, right? All the other songs are performed flawlessly and come across clear and well done.<br />This is a great live album like I said even though it is worn in places and has a few low points, there are more high points then low so it more then makes up for where it lags behind.
0140177396|5.0|A perfect example of John Steinbeck's skills as a writer. In only a little over hundred pages, John Steinbeck quickly sets up a storyline and relantionship that comes to a heart-cutting conclusion that gets you far deepr and sharper then most novels that'd need hundreds of pages just to delude its characters that'd you'd feel as much for as Lennie and George, this novel's two main protagonists.<br />In a short summary George and Lennie are simply two rootless drifters-for-sale who go around and pretty much take up any job available. George is \\"small and quick and dark of face\\" while Lennie is a magnificently large and powerful giant with the mind of a mentally stunted child. Lennie and George are very much outcasts from society, but when it comes to George, such a rootless life is of his emotional chaining to the Lennie whom he knows that he cannot leave behind. George stresses to Lennie that, if it wasn't for him, he could live an easy, comfortable lif, complete with a woman. But he knows however, that he cannot leave Lennie behind, this great man-child.<br />This relationship, based on both George's disdain and regret for having to put down his chances for an easy life to help guide and protect Lennie and his own love for this great giant, not to mention the duo's own fantasial dreams of someday having their land, a place to call their own, is simply moving, something that just gets you. And as one reads on the power, the depth, that runs under this relationship, only just furthers your empathy and appreciation of the relationship that these two share. All of this  coming down to an ending that could quite possibly end up being one of the most, if not the most, emotionally quick, puncturing, and sharp ending in all of the history of literature. And only a great writer like John Steinbeck could possibly ascend to the demands of such a great task.<br />Anyhow, it comes down to this simple message; buy, read, and watch your eyes get teary.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones' second album is notably different than her first but just as powerful, if not more so.  Music is personal;  Norah's growing as a person and an artist, so it's a bit silly for people to expect the exact same thing as her debut album.  Looking at the comments of the reviewers who only gave this album  one or two stars, I wonder if they actually LISTENED to the whole thing.  Those reviewers  share three problem; most insult Norah (not the music), can't spell, or write a decent sentence.  Ignore the negativity.  Some compared her to Britney Spears. Please, give me a break!<br />If you are a true music lover and liked the first album, treat yourself to this one.<br />Oh, and the prettiest thing? Her voice. For lyrics to both albums, check out this site:<br />[...]

B000003TA4|5.0|This is probably the best album i've ever heard, and this album is what got me turned on to the group. I've always been a sucker for great melodies with a hard shock-rock twist along with well written kyrics, and this album MORE than delivers. I've since looked into Nirvana's other albums and they too are amazing. But i'd have to say this is my favorite. If you liked this ablum you might like ten by pearl jam.
0385507755|5.0|Biographies can often seem a little bit preachy, especially when it comes to the topic of drug and alcohol addiction. I picked up James Frey's biography expecting it to be just like every other; preachy and feel good, trying too hard to get its moral across. But A Million Little Pieces is much, much more than that. <br />A Million Little Pieces tells the story of James Frey, who became addicted to alcohol when he was ten years old and to drugs just a few years later. After a drunken frenzy, he wakes up in a plane with no recollection of what happened to him. When the plane lands, his parents pick him up at the airport to bring him to a detox centre.<br />James spends the next month of his life trying to deal with his addiction and trying to make amends with his past. James goes through a week of hell as his system tries to get used to this new life of sobriety. The things he describe in the book sent shivers down my back and made me cringe with horror. An accident before going to the detox centre left him with his teeth broken and his cheek torn open; the ordeal of getting his teeth fixed (without any anaesthetics) is one of the most horrific things I've ever read.<br />In detox, James meets a man named Leonard, a mob boss who takes James under his wing and makes sure that he sobers up properly. He also befriends an ex boxer and a couple of hard-edged guys, as well as an alcoholic judge. He also meets Lilly, another patient with a similar history (...).  <br />The thing that makes this story stand out is Frey himself. His character is strong but stubborn. His writing is swift, sometimes funny, sometimes horrifying. I can't imagine any human being soundly surviving everything he goes through during the span of this book. But he does. And Frey always gives his readers a little bit of sunshine. Although (...). <br />I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of biographies. But this one was totally inspiring. It brought me to a place I never thought I'd visit and, for a time, it almost felt as if I was right there with James, going through what he was going through. The section of the book where he tries to reconnect with his parents was particularly affecting. <br />A Million Little Pieces is the kind of book that will bring some changes in you. Although the writing isn't always incredible, the story itself will grab you by the gut, disturbing and comforting you all at the same time. It is a great biography that I will surely come back to in a near future.
0385510438|1.0|First 2 Grisham books great. The rest, pardon me, stink. I have tried and tried and tried - loyal to a fault. But none of them are anywhere close to A Time to Kill and The Firm.<BR>How sad.<BR>Finally thought it time to try again and picked up The Last Juror. Another mistake. <BR>This book is average at best and full of hoo-hum drama. If you must read it, pick it up and the library. Not worth, frankly, your time or money.
076790592X|5.0|&quot;Tuesday with Morrie.&quot; It was a heart felt book. The lessons will touch everyones heart. It brought tears to my eyes as it brought back memories and lessons learned from  experiences. <br />Morrie is the type of  Friend I'd love to have! <br />He was a proponent of emotional expression, touch, love, kindness, and respect for others. He's a Mentor, a Coach, a Motivator.<BR> <BR>I loved his sense of humor and positive attitude.  His colorful character made you laugh as well as cry!<br />There were many lesson from Morrie that I will cherish and keep close to heart: Family and Love, Acceptance of others, respect for differences, embracing of new worlds, service to others, simple pleasures, joy of friends, happiness through others.<br />This was a great book. It really helped to understand the value other people can play in your life.<br />It was a Thought Provoking and Meaningful Read. <BR>Tuesday with Morrie should be required reading for everyone especially on Tuedays!

B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns `n' roses is one of the greatest bands, who have ever walked the earth. They broke all the rules for rock music. They through up on the stage, and pissed all over the place, and would give you a great time at their shows. Finally there is a collection with all their classic songs. It's to bad they broke up though, sewing each other because we don't really need that, what we need is their music back. On the tombstone it should say \\"Guns \\"n\\" Roses 1987-1993, the band who made music fun again, the band that could cheer you up with a song, and put a smile on your face\\" That's definitely what it should say.<br /> I thought this greatest hits collection should have been 2 disc. This only has 14 songs, I was expecting an unreleased track at least. Or at least a booklet, because this greatest hits cd doesn't have a booklet.  And when you open this don't worry, because there is no cd cover, it just has a lot of scratches and in the middle it says Guns `n' Roses greatest hits. There is a lot of drawbacks but this cd covers it. But there are some things that could have made it way better. These are the songs and the albums they were from. <br />1.welcome to the jungle (appetite for destruction)<BR>2.sweet child o' mine (appetite for destruction)<BR>3.patience (gn'r lies)<BR>4.paradise city (appetite for destruction)<BR>5.knockin on heaven's door (use your illusion 2) <BR>6.civil war (use your illusion 2)<BR>7.you could be mine (use your illusion 2)<BR>8.don't cry (use your illusion 1)<BR>9.

B0000640SB|4.0|I must come clean right from the start and admit that I'm considering buying the \\"Superbit Collection\\" version of \\"MIB\\". Then I could generously give disc one of my \\"Deluxe Edition\\" to a friend. Now I'm rationalizing, so it's on to the DVD in question. (Although I should mention that there's yet another version, the \\"Collector's Series\\" disc with DTS audio encoding. Oh, and I almost left out the \\"Limited Edition\\"--wouldn't want to do that, as it could confuse matters.)<br />The first \\"MIB\\" was one of those rare summer releases that actually lived up to expectations: It was wonderfully cast, and the effects never got in the way of the story. The only problem was that it could have been a bit longer--how often do you say that about a movie?<br />Granted, the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" DVD doesn't have DTS; it does have Dolby Digital 5.1 encoding which should be sufficient for the vast majority of us. Video quality is good: On a scale of 1-5 I'd give it a slightly generous 4. The pairing of Barry Sonnenfeld and Tommy Lee Jones to do the voice-over commentary is inspired: They come at the film from totally different viewpoints. Disc 2 makes up a bit for the brevity of the film by including extended and alternate scenes. Admittedly, Disc 2 has lost some of its appeal - it feels somewhat dated, which it is - since it contains a \\"teaser trailer\\" of - and a \\"sneak peak\\" at - \\"MIB II\\", along with other filler like storyboards and production notes. And if you're pining for those days when MTV was playing Will Smith's titular video on the hour, it's there, too.<br />All things considered, the \\"MIB Deluxe Edition\\" DVD is a worthwhile addition to your library. Every few months I pop it in the player--the movie is short enough so that it won't consume the entire evening unless I subsequently start digging into the extras. Come to think of it, I don't really need the \\"Superbit\\" version....
B000002KIE|5.0|In 1977 the sex pistols finished a recorded that I can listen to over and over again. The sex pistols are an awesome band for the early years of punk. They were in the olden days where punk was still dangerous. This cd has good quality for a cd that was recorded in 1977. They cleaned it up real good or a 1977 record. Anarchy in the U.K is the best song on the album. You could also heir it in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4. These songs are amazing with great lyrics. 4 guys from the U.K have changed the face of punk music by getting kicked out of bars and getting stoned all the time. Sid Vicious is the disaster but he still rocks!!!They definitely deserved to be in the Rockin Roll Hall Of Fame. A must get for all punkers
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a film I saw and fell in absolute love with. Every frame, every movement, every feeling it created in the busy, vibrant setting kept my eyes, and my heart, glued to the screen. <BR>Indeed, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a movie that succeeds by creating moods. In fact, I think that is why many who do not appreciate this movie fail to have enjoyed it: It's not so much about what is happening or where the story is going, but about the tensions and the aura that the film creates between its main characters' lives and how they develop that in the - to Americans, at least - foreign world of Japan. <br />Bill Murray and Scarlet J. do a phenomenal job of creating subtlety. Yes the movie is slow places, and yes it does not seem to be going anywhere easily identifiable. But that is the magic of it! The beauty in the story comes from the fact that Bill and Scarlet go off on a little journey that is totally separating them from the schedules, boundaries and relationships of the realities they live in.<br />I adored the gentleness with which the two leads interacted and how sporadically free some scenes were to just explore their own destinations. This is a movie that builds very slowly to a soft anticlimax. It doesn't matter what Murray whispers into Scarlet's ear after a lovingly painful embrace near the film's end. What matters is that for a little while they escaped together, and that for a little while, they left behind everything of consequence in their lives. <br />What makes some films beautiful are their plots. What makes others beautiful are their cinematography. This is a film that is made beautiful by its ambience; a movie made complete by its mood. It's a film that urges you to get inside the characters, and feel what they are feeling rather than simply watching what is happening on screen and waiting for it to be dramatic or funny.<br />Much like the recent (and brilliant, in another way) &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,&quot; some movies are meant to be appreciated on a level different from others. <BR>Enjoying &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is not a matter of intelligence or attention span: It's a matter of losing yourself in a feeling, and leaving your expectations at the door.
0385504209|1.0|I've been hearing that Dan Brown is a white supremacist and said some bad things about black women. Anyone here know if this is true?

B0000DYJM6|5.0|First of all I would like to start off with the person who bashed nirvana. KURT, not Curt, was a rock god and revoulutionized rock music as much as the beatles did. i respect your opinion to not like nirvana, but don't voice it in a negative light becuase some of us like &quot;Curt the left-hander.&quot;<BR>Anyway, Lost Dogs is Pearl Jam at their best and is worth its small pricetag. Don't hesitate to buy these CDs.
B0000634EV|5.0|I may be new to the entire genre of metal, (and, indeed, most other rock out there..) but I've had a good instructor in the process of figuring out what was good, and what needed a second flush to make it all go down. And though I tend to latch onto whatever metal is put under my nose, I needed no prompting to know that this is a good album.<br />I've seen many reviews at this, and other websites, screaming that Down's first album was superior. Seeing as I haven't heard one lick of the first album, I must say I adore this one. And judging by comments that people have made about the first album, saying that it was much harder, I'd probably prefer II over NOLA. <br />Truth is, this album doesn't feel like most of the metal I've heard on my little journey into the genre. It's mellow, and flowing, but at the same time manages to have original and completely mind-blowing solos at times. Plus, the intro to &quot;Learn From My Mistake&quot; gives me shivers. Who'd have thought that Anselmo could go from the throat-scratchy Pantera tracks, to eerie, haunting lyrics. He seems to bring to life all of the emotions in each and every song, especially that one. Another favorite is &quot;Ghosts Along the Mississippi.&quot;<br />Besides, how is it possible to dislike an album with a doobie interlude? Doesn't hurt that the track is JUST long enough to get your next joint nice and rolled to enjoy the rest of the album. Gotta love some stoner rock.<br />In summary, highly recommended. Can be widely enjoyed for the musical value, but there is nothing like putting the album on, and toking up to these guys. =D
0385504209|5.0|Before anyone gets their religious beliefs or artistic expertise in a knot, remember that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is only a book and a good mystery at that.  It will leave you guessing at every turn of the page.<br />Dan Brown's character Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon goes to Paris to give yet another lecture and becomes involuntarily involved in one of history's greatest mysteries...the Holy Grail.  What is it truly?  What does it mean?  And how does it affect the outcome of all that the world has come to \\"believe\\" as fact?<br />The curator, Jacques Sauniere, of the Musee du Louvre in Paris is murdered, but this is no random killing.  This man happens to be the Grand Master of the secret society known as the Priory of Sion.  Established in 1099, this organization is bound to secrecy in the preserving and location of the Holy Grail which has been sought for centuries.  After being shot in the museum, Sauniere uses his own body; Da Vinci's encrypted artwork, and his avid use of code to pass on clues to his granddaughter Sophie Neveu in locating the infamous keystone which leads to the Grail.<br />Robert, who is falsely accused of the murder, teams up with Sophie who happens to be a Police Cryptologist.  Becoming suspects on the run through Paris the two must play detective.  In deciphering Sauniere's clues they come across a box for which they have no idea what is inside.  What they find is what is called a keystone.  Who ever wanted this keystone is behind not only Sauniere's murder, but three other murders that same night of prominent members in the Priory of Sion and a nun.<br />Their adventure leads throughout Paris, to Westminster Abbey in London to the Rosslyn Chapel in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br />The keystone holds a two thousand year old secret that can change the fate of all.<br />This book is a true mystery from start to finish.  Some will be appalled by the religious replications made or question the accuracy in the referenced artwork.  I am not an expert in either area.  However, I do applaud Brown celebrating the other essential half of spiritual enlightenment...the feminine side.  Women have be demonized in society for far too long.in either area.

B00009W8N2|4.0|The difference between Opeth's newer releases and their older releases is vast, and listening to Orchid is key in understand ingthe band's substantial development with each album.  Their early stuff sounds like gothenburg-style melodic metal, with extremely long song lengths, and some acoustic interludes for flavor.  Their new stuff is grandiose, with very fancy production, complicated, ingenious songwriting and amazingly moving instrumentals, vocals and lyrics.  Opeth have improved (more or less) with each album they release, which means that Orchid is one of (if not the) worst of their albums, but it isn't by any means bad.<br />First time through, it'll feel like a bunch of good, albeit redundant forays into the melodic metal genre, with some pretty standard death vocals (mid-pitched rasping) with pretty dull production.  The production isn't horrible, it's just nothing very interesting.  I find that the guitars sound pretty good, while the drums sound ok, to downright awful (the bass drum sounds like a techno beat.)  That being said, the songs are still very interesting, and upbeat.  Compared to the new, slower, darker material with clean transitions into new territory, Orchid feels like a sporadic effort that's all over the place.  Time signatures, melodies and riffs change at the drop of the hat without warning, which can come across as a result of undeveloped songwriting.  I just see it as a different sort of songwriting, though, as the end result still sounds very pleasing.  <br />The songs are long, and drag on for a while, lacking the focus and direction of their more recent releases (namely Blackwater Park and Deliverance) but it's hard not to appreciate that great riffage going on here.  Most of these songs are largely instrument-based, relying very little on atmospherics, or even vocals the way the more recent material does.  There are acoustics and clean vocals thrown in, but somewhat rarely, and the execution is generally sub-par.  <br />Orchid has alot of things that can be criticized, namely the lack of intelligence and polish to the entire album, but you can't help but marvel at the nice melodies and visceral feel of the songs. In many ways, it's more daring and carefree than any of their other releases, not afraid to throw in all sorts of unexpected and often unorthodox components to a song.  The structure of all the songs comes across as almost random, and very prone to radical change at any moment.  This being said, the (mostly) 10+ minute songs all meander their way through the album, with little regard to their length or whether their song structure is even logical or methodical in any way.<br />With the exception of Silouette (an interesting piano solo) and Requiem (an acoustic guitar intelude) most of the songs have similar feels to one another, centralized around soft/hard dynamics, thanks to acoustic interludes, a few clean vocals thrown in (but mostly death growls) and very standard double-bass fills and gothenburg guitar riffs and melody lines.  The album is like listening to 5 extremely long In Flames or Dark Tranquillity songs, with some unexpected variety of the calmer variety.  Fans of Gothenburg should see no problem here, while the rest of us might be able to pick out some blaring issues with Orchid.  Nevertheless, this is definitely worth picking up.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|Everyone was chanting and raving about the biggest event Wrestlemania 20. I wanted to see it so bad. i paid 20 bucks to pitch in watching it at mai friends house. This was a good ppv for an average ppv like summerslam, unforgiven, etc. but not for wrestlemania, untop of that WMXX. Big mistake, this was the worst direction the WWE went.<br />Here are some notes on some matches!<br />HHH vs. Benoit vs. HBK - awesome match, no negative<br />Guerrero vs. angle- decent, except the ending was bad<br />Undertaker vs. kane- taker was a big dissapointment<br />Brock vs. Goldberg -too short, with more talk then ever, boring<br />Jericho vs. Christian- good match, liked it allot<br />rock and foley vs. evolution - if only rock and foley teamed up with hogan it would've been allot better<br />torrie and sable vs. stacy and jackie -t & a, thats about it<br />molly vs. victoria - good women's match<br />the fatal four way tag team matches were a joke and so was the cruiserweight open (should of been a battle royal)
B00001U0E1|5.0|(...)<br />the movie is great and only once i've gone through the commentary tracks did i realize how truly amazing the script really is (if you're a shakespeare scholar you'd have realized that without the commentary tracks i suppose). indeed the tracks are very informative, one is by director john madden and one by cast & crew, which is an mix of interviews and separate commentaries made by each individual. most noteworthy to listen to is the evil executive producer-cum-groupie julie goldstein who really sounds like a hollywood suit trying to tamper with the movie but talks about how she came to 'see the light' and let the movie be made the way it was written.<br />the featurette is great, talking about shakespeare on film and showing clips of other shakespeare movies. the trailers and tv spots are disgusting, the costume design featurette is nice and the deleted scenes are really interesting to see (especially the one of viola in america).<br />if you haven't read all of shakespeare's plays yet then a lot of the comedy will be lost on you, this is where the commentaries come in, they explain how everything fits in together and will cause you to laugh about a lot more things. indeed i change my mind about what i wrote at the beginning. this movie DID deserve the oscar.

B0000844I8|5.0|indeed this is probably the best sci-fi movie, personally speaking of course. i've seen it countless times and this special edition includes the way-better director's cut which features more depth and more action. first i'll mention that the actores are all amazing - james spader and jay williamson in particular deliver exceptional performances, especially during their scenes together (i'd even say you can write a queer studies seminar paper on ra's character), and mili avital was an excellent casting choice as well (though too bad she has not gathered much momentum since and mainly does israeli tv nowadays).<br />dvd-wise the featurettes are great, especially the erich von däniken segment, the director/producer commentary is very very interesting as well just because of the great thought and resources that went into creating this film. i have to say that the reason this is one of the best sci-fi films ever is because it's so well researched, and it doesn't try to make itself simple to understand for the average joe viewer. i've also read the novel adaptation and it's the same case there as well. when you compare this movie to the tripe that's usually being produced when it comes to sci-fi, you can see that there is a clear motivation for everything and even a highly believable scenario - aliens don't just come to earth out of the blue, just like von däniken's book states, there has always been enough 'evidence' on earth to suggest that the ra character exists, that the stargate existed etc.. of course it's all far-fetched but not impossible nonetheless.<br />finally the musical score in the movie is one of the greatest scores ever so make sure you have your sorround system installed for this movie.
B00005AQF7|4.0|This is one of the best LPs to come out of Death Row Records. Produced by Dr. Dre, it has about 13 tracks (plus 5 skits). The singles include: Gin &amp; Juice, Murder Was The Case, &amp; Who Am I (Whats My Name); all which are huge hits. I give this record 4/5. If you like old school gangsta rap, this is for you (especially if you liked Dr. Dre's &quot;The Chronic&quot;.
B0000640SA|5.0|so the movie itself it first class first of all - innovative, extremely hard to follow and requires several viewings. the way the dvd's are produced is another thing - the film itself as well as all the options and extras are all kinda like easter eggs that you have to find. the disc itself only specifies the actual features i.e. the nice sundance channel documentary, the original short story memento mori, the trailers and picture gallery, but you have to pay a lot more attention to find the really hidden easter eggs, and boy the dvd doesn't make it easy to find them, even if you found instructions on the web of how to locate them!<br />the most important easter egg is the film in reverse sequence, i.e. in the realtime chronological order of the scenes - very nice to watch but only after you've seen the original sequence of the feature. another easter egg is a couple of japanese posters for the film and a nearly impossible to read journal made by leonard (i couldn't read any of it, maybe you need a hi-def tv for that...)<br />but for me the best easter egg is the alternate director's commentaries. basically for the last 20 minutes of the commentary track, there are 4 separate commentaries by the director. i won't tell you how to find them (and not many website will) but needless to say they are so hard to find that i still haven't managed to listen to one of those 4 commentaries. the first one is a continuation of the commentary from the rest of the film, i.e. talking about the movie etc., two other commentary tracks concern teddy's character with opposing views about him in each track. this is a fantastic idea because different people will hear different commentaries about teddy (assuming they've found the easter egg) and will draw different conclusions about him, and then in some hypothetical debate they'll go head-to-head with those who'd heard the opposing commentary track, if you know what i mean. finaly the fourth alternate commentary is the most interesting just because it's recorded backwards! i'd love to hear what's being said about it but to do that you'd need to record the track on a tape deck and then play it in reverse... not quite sure how to do that nowadays since i don't even own a tape deck but it would be interesting to hear what's on it.<br />i also read that none of the bonus features from the original one-disc dvd are included in this special edition 2-discer so that's a shame, but then again all those easter eggs will eventually drive you insane anyway so no need for even more extras!<br />a couple of final notes, apart from the alternate commentaries, the actuall full-length director's commentary can become tedious just because he never shuts up and just moves from one idea to another without any break in between them, and he doesn't always sound very clear with his low british accent voice. finally guy pearce in great in this movie and boy was i surprised to learn he's the guy from Priscilla Queen of the Desert! Great acting altogether and amazing editing.
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah Carey was at her peak vocally on this album.  Her voice was at her best.  The production quality on the cd is also extremely high.  If anyone's thinking about investing in a Carey album, then go with this one first.  There's quite a few classics on here.  Hero, and Without You are a couple of her most huge songs ever, and they both show you just what kind of a beautitul, amazing voice she had back then.  Anytime You Need a Friend is the best song on the album, and one of her best vocal performances ever.  The power and range in her voice is unsurpassed on this song.  It leaves me with my jaw open every time I hear it at how a human being can sing like this.  Just stunning.  Fantastic album on her part!
B00007BKVC|5.0|the special edition dvd from mgm is great, a lot of work has gone into it and it shows! the movie itself is just as amazing nowadays as it was back in 1991 and the screenplay continues to be a landmark, insofar as it was the main movie we studied at screenwriting class when i took film at university.<br />there are two commentary tracks on the dvd, one with ridley scott which is very informative regarding the technical side of directing the movie (and even talks a lot about his previous movies, especially blade runner), and the second track features susan sarandon and geena davis together with screenwriter callie khouri. this track is a combination of the three sitting together and monologues of the three regarding their aspect in the filmmaking process. khouri does go on and on about her script (deservedly so) though the real jem here is geena davis who is just so funny to listen to, it's like watching the movie together with her, and her chemistry with sarandon is great.<br />the deleted scenes are great fun to watch though inconsequential to the plot (therefore they were deleted) and the famous alternate ending which we've all heard so much about is finally presented in all its glory, though safe to say scott made the right decision by choosing the ending in the film itself. scott also has a commentary for the 3.5 minute long alternate ending.<br />the documentary is thorough and is extremely well produced (especially the way it introduces the brad pitt section, who made his film début on thelma &amp; louise) and the music video for the forgettable theme by glenn frey is also present, as well as a storyboard for the final chase scene, which is about as exciting as storyboards get (they're not). there are also a few (horrible) trailers for the movie and a look into how the movie was marketed back in the day, really interesting actually.<br />ridley is a great director and this is another in his long run of fabulous movies (i ever like 'legend' a lot!) and the dvdis a top-notch production from mgm! it's a flipper with the movie on one side of the dvd and most of the extras on the other side, a great mgm idea that's more practical than 2-dvd sets. highly recommended! now all that's left to do is release a cd of the entire amazing film score by hans zimmer.

B00005YU1O|5.0|okay, i truly love this movie, every aspect of it! notwithstanding the great animation (each segment of the film being animated from real-life footage by dozens of separate artists), the premise of the film as a lucid dream is simply awsome. i myself have only had a handful of lucid dreams so far though the movie did indeed inspire my latest one! and it's encouraged me to start 'dreaming' more seriously nowadays.<br />anyways back to the dvd. it's chock-full of nifty extras. first off there are 3 commentary tracks, each for a separate aspect of the film. the first one if regarding the animation process and is basically all of the animators (20+) talking about their segments, why they chose them and how they chose to animate them. very interesting but mainly technical stuff so not for the faint-hearted. next is the great commentary track with director richard linklater and cast members. this is my favorite one because hearing hero wiley wiggins on the track just makes you fall in love with him, he's so sweet! third up is a text commentary (i.e. subtitles over the film) which is incredibly fascinating and regards the ideas and philosophies the people wiley's character encounters throughout the film are speaking of. take note though that the subtitles are incredibly long and run by really fast so if you want to indulge in the explanations you'll have to have your finger on the pause button throghout the film to be able to catch everything.<br />the deleted animated scenes are nice as are the other animated shorts bob sabiston and linklater had made that are included in the dvd (it is a great dvd after all!), and you can catch a glimpse of the real-live action by looking at selected live action takes as well. the featurette is nice and the animation tutorial is incredibly technical and therefore not really engrossing, and finally the trailers are a nice way of seeing how the plot of a movie can be warped entirely by (most probably) hollywood suits to fool people into going to see a movie which is totally different.<br />this is one movie you'll be watching again and again throughout your life!
B0000TLA9G|2.0|I thought GnR started their downfall after Appetite for Destruction. Lies stunk. Use Your Illusion was a different band . . . overproduced and overorchestrated.

0679735909|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  What a masterpiece.  Byatt is just superb in this book.  I've read one other book by her and didn't care for it at all.  With Possession, she managed to tap into a wealth of talent and imagination.  It's about as close to being perfect as a book can get.  I was always totally engaged by it, and loved even the poetry she'd written (and I am NOT a poetry fan by any means! .. so this was quite an achievement.)  ..Fabulous, beautiful book.

B0001I55OC|4.0|I am a fan of the author Michael Crichton, and I will not comment on the differences between the book and the movie, as they are never the same. I'll admit, the \\"3-D fax machine\\" and the \\"worm-hole\\" are crummy ways of explaining time travel, but the sheer adventure of time travel is thrilling.<br />The director, Donner, paces the action briskly and seems unaware or simply unperturbed by the campy dialogue supplied by Crichton's adapters -- writers Jeff Maguire and George Nolfi. Similarly, the actors tear into these thin roles with a passion worthy of Shakespeare. This \\"over-acting\\" may be enough to draw some people away.<br />All-in-all, Timeline is not a masterpiece, but it is a film that is a personal favorite. It is a typical movie that you hear about opening weekend, and than may go the rest of your life without hearing from it again. Timeline is a film you should see, but not one you should purchase without giving yourself your own opinion.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies- its the kind that really makes you think. now im not going to retell the plot because it looks like the other 400+ people have already covered that one (possibly ruining it-very sad)but i would definitely recommend it to everyone to see at least once- because you will most likely love it or not like it a whole lot depending on your taste in moves.

B000067DNC|5.0|The first season of Stargate: SG-1 was very good.  It had good stories, but it also had great potential to become something better.  Season 2 has begun to realize said potential.  Many of the episodes this season expanded on ideas and arcs from the first season, as well as introducing new ideas, characters, and locations.  For example, we meet Thor (in his true form), as well as some of the other Asguard, a powerful alliance with the Tok'Ra is formed, the NID storyline is taken in new directions, and we learn about the builders of the Stargate system as well as the origins of the intergalactic U.N. from the first season episode, &quot;The Torment of Tantalus&quot;.  We also meet some new Goa'uld system lords, as well as see the destruction of an old enemy.<BR>The actors (Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, Don S. Davis, and Teryl Rohtery) all grew in their roles as Col. Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Capt. Sam Carter, Teal'c, Gen. George Hammond, and Dr. Janet Frasier.  Not only did they prove their worth as their own characters, some of them got the chance to play others as well in the episode, &quot;Holdiay&quot;.  I'm sure that Judge liked that one because he got to play O'Neill, who is Teal'c's polar opposite.<BR>The storylines were improved this year (not that they were bad last year), with some great examples being: &quot;The Serpent's Lair&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;, &quot;Prisoners&quot;, &quot;Thor's Chariot&quot;, &quot;Secrets&quot;, &quot;The Tok'Ra, Pts. 1 and 2&quot;, &quot;Spirits&quot;, &quot;Touchstone&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Race&quot;, &quot;Serpent's Song&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;1969&quot;, and &quot;Out of Mind&quot;.  There were a few groaners, such as &quot;One False Step&quot;, but overall, this was an awesome season.
B00005QHV5|4.0|It has been over two decades now since Gunter Wand and his Hamburg band recorded the complete symphonies of Beethoven. When his set entered the market, it was already a glutted field, with fantastic cycles from Szell, Karajan, Toscanini, and Bohm to name a few. However, it was immediately recognized as an important addition to the Beethoven discography. But since then, not only have we seen important cycles from Bloomstedt, Barenboim, Abaddo, Harnoncourt, Rattle, and Chailly, but the Johnathan Del Mar editions of the symphonies were released and subsequently recorded to acclaim by Zinman, Vanska, van Immerseel, and Jarvi. Indeed, the Vanska and Jarvi cycles were particularly note-worthy because both conductors showed how there was still something new to say in this music. So, in light of all this \\"new\\" Beethoven, does Wand's Cycle still stand as a reference edition or is it beginning to show its age?     The answer is both yes and no. As far as cycles go, this cycle still retains a spot near the top. However, the competition in the individual symphonies has only gotten stiffer. Indeed, on the whole, Wand does better in the even numbered symphonies than in the odd (excluding the First and his reference Ninth, of course). The First and Second are really wonderful performances, the former for some thrillingly incisive playing, especially from those fabulous trumpets in the minuet and the brass in the finale, and the latter because Wand (correctly) views the Second as a revolutionary pre-Eroica rather than an overgrown \\"classical\\" symphony. The Fourth is spirited, while the Eighth has some really wonderful moments in the inner movements. The Sixth is equally fine, with a truly frightening thunderstorm and a embarrassingly effective hymn of Thanksgiving at the close of the shepherd's song.   Competition in the odd-number symphonies is fiercer. Wand's Eroica was always interesting because it was one of the few recordings where the conductor opted for Beethoven's originalinstrumentation, rather than von Bulow's re-orchestration. However, today, most conductors use dispense with von Bulow's well-meaning additions. This, coupled with more-spirited tempos (Wand's Eroica allegro was always somewhat slow and labored), makes new versions, from the likes of Vanksa and Jarvi, preferable. Wand's Seventh was fine, but ensemble problems plagued the slow introduction, and the finale was always a bit bottom-heavy. Even when it was released, Wand's Seventh did not reach the Apollonian heights of Szell's or Kleiber and certainly sounds heavy when compared to the Zinman, Fischer, or Harnoncourt. Wand's Fifth was always somewhat of an acquired taste. It was less fire and brimstone (cue Kleiber) and more about clean articulation and rhythmic drive. The trio of the Scherzo was unnecessarily heavy and the finale at times sounded clogged. Still, in that same movement's climax, Wand delivered one of the most thrillingly clear and powerful climaxes, leading into a truly haunting ghost of the trio. At the same time, Jarvi's fabulous Fifth improves on Wand's interpretation with more incisive playing and more textural clarity.  I am happy to report, however,  that Wand's Ninth is just a fresh, vigorous, and interpretively exciting as it was twenty years ago. And while our ears have certainly been tempered by the period and historically-informed movement, which might account for the heaviness of Wand's account, the interpretive merits of this performance are many. For one, Wand adopts a moderate tempo for the opening allegro, but imbues the music with unheard-of energy, not through unnecessary rubatto or indulgent excessiveness, but by incisive playing, crisp articulation, and a keen understanding of sonata form. The development is one of the most trilling on disc, but the beginning of the recapitulation is truly special, showing how the sheer force and muscularity of Wand's reading creates a much for satisfying climax than those of conductors who have the brass down-out the strings. Wand's Scherzo will certainly sound big to modern ears, especially with the timpanist who does not always keep tempo. Still, the wind playing is about as spectacular as you'll find on disc, certainly as colorful as the above listed reference editions, and more idiomatic than either Zinman or Vanska. The always problematic trio seems perfectly placed and ebbs magically out of the music of the Scherzo proper. The tempo in the adagio, to me, is ideal, at sixteen minutes, which allows Wand and his players to shape the music without letting tension sag. The finale is equally fine, a satisfyingly large performance. The opening orchestral recititive and joy theme is really wonderful, while the tutti outburst before the entrance of the baritone is truly terrifying. The huge climax on Gott is stunning, but Wand wisely has the Turkish march start immediately at a good clip, not only maintaining tension but setting the pace for the great double fugue. The closing passages and coda bring the symphony to a thrilling, and hair-raising conclusion. The soloists are some of the finer on disc, not simply as individuals but because their ensemble work is sensitive and quite well balanced against the mass of singers and players.   All in all, this remains a wonderful cycle, and even though there may be better Eroica's out there or more energized Sevenths, Wand's approaches have merit, are interpretively fascinating, and are still better than most of the cycles currently available. This would be a great cycle for those new to this music and is really necessary for any well-rounded Beethoven collection.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Sorry, but you can't judge this movie without having first seen it. First of all, it's not just a whodunit. It's a movie about life, and how we all live in cages that society has made for us. It's about Lester (Kevin Spacey) breaking free of society, and his failure. It's about how his life slowly unravels,, and his ultimate death. It truly is drama; it makes you laugh sometimes (quotes &quot;You are SO busted, and f**k me your majesty!), but at the end it's really sad. It's not just a whodunit, and by the way, it wasn't the daughter.

B00007AJF9|4.0|It is interesting to reflect on a situation where Paltrow wins a Best Actress Oscar (a concept in intself) over one of Australia's finest exports and most gifed actors, Cate Blanchett.  God only knows why such a vapid, essentially boring performance as Paltrow's was rewarded over such an intricate dramatic study.  Blanchett's performance is honestly powerful and often bewildering.  Her acting technique is flawless and her careful choices reward her audience.  Australia produces many of the world's leading actors, directors and designers, this fact is known, but Blanchett's lost Oscar is still a bit of a mystery.
B000002TLX|5.0|I knock pop music all the time.  I'm not gonna appologize for that here.  However, I can tell you that Richard Marx mixes his pop music with just enough rock to give it a flavor that distinguishes it from all that radio-friendly crap (although his music is not stranger to the top of the charts, either).<br />This was the first CD I purchased by Marx (I've since bought a couple others).  It remains one of my favorite CD's I've listened to.  Marx may have appeal to women (...) but this GUY is here to tell you that his music is for men, too; especially those who love good music.<br />Marx certainly knows how to write.  Such rockers as \\"Don't Mean Nothing,\\" \\"Take This Heart,\\" and \\"Satisfied\\" are superb entertainment delights; tender ballads, such as \\"Right Here Waiting\\" and \\"Now and Forever\\" hold your attention riveted.<br />I must say, his best music is his power ballads.  Such numbers as \\"Endless Summer Nights,\\" \\"Should've Known Better,\\" \\"Angelia,\\" and \\"Hold on to the Nights\\" are powerful and moving.  Others fit more diversely into a category.  (...) \\"Hazard\\" is a beautiful story song about a man suspected of murdering his lover--probably my favorite Marx song to date.  \\"The Way She Loves Me\\" is a groovy number featuring Lionel Ritche and Luther Vandross.<br />Not all of these songs are standouts, of course.  \\"Angel's Lullaby,\\" written for Marx's kids, is a bit too personal for anyone other than a parent to grasp.  \\"Until I Find You Again\\" lacks something the other power ballads have.  \\"Keep Coming Back\\" just can't keep your attentioin; and \\"Children of the Night\\" is basically a cliched charity song--good intentions, but not great music.<br />Other than that, Richard Marx's GREATEST HITS is quite an acheivement--an album of great songs that meld pop and rock into a groove that Marx's raspy voice cleary identifies with.  In a world where \\"alternative\\" music is considered the only music of value, it's nice to hear someone doing something different with pop music.

B00006JDS4|3.0|&quot;I Spit On Your Grave&quot; is one of those movies that I'm not real sure if I like or not. The rape scenes were brutal, as were the victim's revenge scenes-- brutality simply isn't that big of a deal these days, so it wasn't as &quot;shocking&quot; as I thought it would be. The bathtub scene was a little difficult to handle-- and it happened so fast I couldn't look away. &quot;Last House On the Left&quot; is a much better rape/revenge movie, with a stronger plot, better acting, and a surprisingly well done soundtrack the blends awkwardly but effectively with the subject matter-- check them both and you be the judge. If senseless, lengthy, hillbilly rape scenes is what your looking for check this bad-boy out.

B000000WCX|4.0|Bowie's late 90's techno-pop experiment was a large departure for the chameleon king.  Considering that nearly the entire album is drenched in programming and drum loops, it's nearly mechanical with no soul.  Even so, there is an addictive quality to its musical presence.  The opening track, \\"Little Wonder\\", is a hypnotical dance number that has drum patches bouncing around the speakers like gun spray.  \\"Seven Years In Tibet\\" presents a much needed relief from the frenzy, until the chorus kicks in with a serious graveness.  The layering of guitars and keyboards is fantastic.  However, the lyrics in \\"Telling Lies\\" and \\"Looking For Satellites\\" are grating, repetitive and tiresome.  A great standout cut is \\"I'm Afraid Of Americans\\", with a heavy bass-laden nastiness and some keyboard work with old buddy Brian Eno.  The lyrics are funny and shocking at the same time.  It's no little wonder that Bowie used this song as the album's representative cut on his collection set.

0345347951|2.0|So aliens come to Earth and impose peace and order, along with restrictions. Why are they here? Are they trying to help us? Is is good to be ruled by a foreign species? These questions are posed and then answered in the strangest and most implausible manner. Basicaly, the aliens are here because of Ms Cleo!<br />So, what is this novel? At first I thought it was a libertarian fantasy about the dangers of authoritarianism. But it isn't that at all. Is it about man's future in space, as it sort of seems to be? Not, really...the book says that man's future is not in the stars. <br />All in all, I can see why Clarke wants to distance himself from the views presented in this book...so why did he write it at all?
0312995423|4.0|Not being a computer person, I do not know what is inaccurate in this book. Having read Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I do take novels from Dan Brown with a grain of salt. He puts forth interesting ideas deviating from the mainstream that are fun to read. Digital Fortress is not as well written with the depth of the later books. I also found the answer to the identity of the mystery character to be obvious quite early in the story-line. That being said, Digital Fortress is well worth reading and has a nail-biter of an ending. As with the other books, I enjoyed observing watching the characters work at solving a puzzle. If this was Brown's most recent work, I may have been dissappointed. However as a first effort it is a definite thumbs up and demonstrates his growth in the last several years.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Music: 4.5 stars  Compilation: 3.5 stars<br />When Axl Rose and Slash heard that Geffen Records was about to release a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, they (unsuccesfully) sued to suppress the release. Reasons stated by Axl in the lawsuit: (1) Geffen did not consult him on the track-listing (note to Axl: Geffen OWNS the rights to these songs!) and (2) the release would hinder/endanger the release of the long-awaited &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; album (I haven't laughed this hard in a long time!).<br />&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (14 tracks, 79 min.) is, without a doubt, a flawed compilation, yet also contains a lot of great music. The essential &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; is under-represented with only 3 tracks (no &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;?) and &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; is over-represented with 2 tracks (including an out-of-context &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot;). &quot;Use Your Illusion I and II&quot; get 7 tracks, rightfully (&quot;November Rain&quot; stills sounds as bombastic and egotistic as ever). There are too many cover songs: 5 of the 14 tracks are covers, including for the first time on a GnR album the so-so (at best) &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; from 1994's &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; soundtrack.<br />Can you really be upset with Geffen Records for releasing this? I mean, they have been waiting TWELVE YEARS for a follow-up studio album. And do you really think at this point that &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; will ever see the light of day? I'm not holding my breath... Meanwhile, this greatest hits (not a &quot;best of&quot;) compiles GnR's best-known songs, which will satisfy most casual GnR fans.
B00005UKKF|1.0|I saw the Onyx hotel show, expecting to see if this girl did anything better than the Vegas show...it was all the same. Britney Spears lip sync the whole show, and the only two songs she really sang (if you want to call it that!) she looked like she was in so much pain, as if she was having kidney stone pains, like a cat in heat! I felt so sorry for her because this girl is pretty with a nice body (it looks like she gained a bit of weight), but she just cannot sing. The whole show was a complete rip-off of many things combined that Madonna and Janet has done to death, nothing original. To me she's a pretty over paid stripper, that happens to be white, blonde and prety and acts like she's the ultimate 'girl next door' type, although everybody knows that's not the case...but hey, not to bash her completely, at least all that plastic sugar coating made her a very rich girl...but always remember, things don't last forever, so she better come up with a new formula soon before it all comes crashing down, she won't be Barbie forever.<br />Want to go see a real diva....MADONNA is coming to town this summer 2004!!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|REVOLVER has everything. There's hard rock (Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing, I Want to Tell You, and Doctor Robert), schmaltz (Eleanor Rigby), beautiful ballads (Here, There, and Everywhere, For No One), sitar music (Love You To), silly sing-alongs (Yellow Submarine and Good Day Sunshine), a Vegas-style show tune (Got to Get You into My Life), and moments of dementia/self loathing (I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, and Tomorrow Never Knows). All of it is immaculately produced (by 1966 standards anyway) and perfectly performed. And it is all memorable. I'm not sure if this is the GREATEST album of all time, but it has to be a serious contender.
B00008EY9G|4.0|As you may be reluctant to watch this movie, reading the story which looks pretty basic, you may expect a lot more than you would.<br />This is not the best movie of the year, but it was sure great and it went beyond all expectations.<br />Otherwise, this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Memento (flashbacks and anachronous stories have not been invented in Memento!) I perfectly understand people who don't like it, but I would say that most of people won't be disapppointed.<br />Of course, if you can bear a little suspense in the movie,don't watch. For all the others, this will be a great catch.
0385510438|2.0|2*<br />Hm...<br />Mr Grisham has set the action of three of his 14 legal thrillers in the small town of Clanton in Ford County, in \\"rural Southern Mississippi\\". The first one was \\"A Time to Kill\\" (1989), the action of which takes place in the mid-'80's; the second one, \\"The Summons\\" (2002); this one (2004) sees its events over a span of 9 years (1970-79), thus preceding those of the other two novels. We find again some of the characters portrayed in the first book: Lucien Wilbanks, still in legal practice as a wily trial lawyer before his disbarment which, towards the end of the book, is however imminent (by the way, where's Jack Brigance?! from what we knew, he already ought to be Lucien's associate at this time);; Harry Rex Vonner, the overweight, mean divorce lawyer, sloppily dressed and looking, but smart and likeable; Claude, the owner of one of the local eateries, barking at customers to finish their meal in 20 minutes so as to accommodate others (the Coffee Shop and the Tea Shoppe, apparently, aren't opened yet); in the third and final part, Judge Omar Noose and the prosecuting magistrate, Rufus Buckley (appointed, we learn here, in 1975). Sheriff Ozzie Walls is not yet in office, and the position is occupied first by a corrupt man, then by an indifferent (as far as characterizations go) one. The scene is the same: the town's square with its courthouse, presumably with General Clanton's (the town's founder and namesake) statue but minus the old men sitting there, spitting out tobacco juice on the lawn; and the nearby Parchman state penitentiary. The book is in three parts: the first one concerns the gruesome rape and murder of the mother of two children, the trial and conviction of the proven criminal, with a sentence to two consecutive life terms in jail; the third one sees his being paroled out (at the second try) after only 9 years of imprisonment, thanks to a distorted presentation of the facts of the crime and of the record of the trial to an incrediblygullible parole board, probably under the thumb (with a financial \\"consideration\\", of course) of the wealthy and wicked family of the convicted man. As soon as the latter is out of jail, serial killings of three former jurors begin and, of course, the direction of suspicions is obvious, because of the threat he had hurled at the jury before it entered its room to deliberate. The second part is a liaison in time. This division takes away the gripping continuity of \\"A Time to Kill\\". The trial scenes are not as compelling. The white/black racial issue is again present, but it was better presented there, as well as the  characterizations; and the evolution of the events much more gripping in its continuation. Callie Ruffin is a nice attempt at characterization, but she looks useless in the context and economy of the plot (nothing on a par with Nicholas Easter's in The Runaway Jury). A Time to Kill, and The Firm, with the gripping continuity of their action, were for this reader \\"no-put-down\\" books; this one needed 4 or 5 dragged-on, reading sessions. The final twist is not convincing. The impression is that Mr Grisham must have found himself in a hurry to deliver the manuscript to the publisher by the deadline.
1563898586|5.0|This was the first Alan Moore comic I read, and I could tell right off the bat why comic fans always speak so reverentially about the man.  After reading just a few panels, it was clear that Moore is someone concerned about the texture of language, the subtext of character, and nuance of meaning.<br />I had heard this one wasn't Moore's best effort, but I wanted to read it before I saw the Sean Connery movie based on it.  I was still highly impressed, however, and thought it was one of the best written comic I'd ever read.  But after just recently finishing Moore's mesmerizing FROM HELL, I can see that by comparison, LEAGUE is a slightly inferior work.  But that's just because FROM HELL is hands-down the most amazingly complex and well written comic novel I've ever read.<br /><br />Still, LEAGUE, a high concept literary action hero romp is a lot of fun, and if it's not quite the toure-de-force that Moore achieved with FROM HELL, it's still a thrilling story.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|In this horror/thriller, Halle Berry stars as Dr. Miranda Grey, a Psycologist at a women's prison.  Charles S. Dutton is the Prisons Administrator.  Or at least I THINK it is a prison as opposed to a mental hospital...it's never really explained and is one of the very mind numbing problems you encounter while watching this movie.<br />Anyway, on her way home from work on a &quot;dark and stormy night&quot; Gray swerves her car to miss a girl standing in the middle of the road.  When she approaces the girl to see if she is OK, the girl bursts into flames and Gray wakes up three days later, locked in the very prison she worked at.  What's more, she is accused of murdering her husband.<br />OK...now I finad it hard to believe that she would be remanded to a prison IMMEDIATELY...would she not be held in jail to await trial?  Would it not take more than a few days for her to be examined by psychiatrists to determine her mental well-being?<br />And even if she was locked up, does anyone think that she would be locked up and put in with the very inmates who she used to work with?  Gothika pushes logic to the limits.<br />Well, while locked up she begins getting ghostly visions of this girl.  Of course her former co-worker Dr. Graham played by Robert Downey jr., believes these are just delusions.<br />The ghost is more than helpful, twice freeing Gray from her cell so she can pursue clues about the spirit.  This leads to the revelation that a man with a tatoo of a woman on fire, is somehow raping women inside the prison and Gray is next on his list.<br />In yet another incredible stretch of logic, while gray escapes from her cell pursued by dozens of guards, she finally makes it to the guard at the front desk who she is friendly with.  Rather than turn her in the guard not only keeps quiet, but actually gives her the keys to her car!!!  Evidently he seems to have no problem throwing away his car and aiding an escaped inmate.<br />Well the clues all come together and reveal some shocking revelations about her husband and the identity of the rapist.  But how can this rapist just come and go into high security areas of the hospital/prison?  Don't ask...it's another one of brain dead plot threads.<br />Finally we see that Gray never does go to jail for her husbands murder.  Evidently possession by a vengeful ghost is a viable murder defense these days.  Incredible.<br />The ghostly images provide a few chills but you've seen the plot before about the dead wanting the living to solve the mystery of their deaths and bring the guilty to justice.  Stir of Echoes did it much more skillfully.<br />Berry made a poor choice of scripts to follow up on an Oscar win.

B0000DIXDR|5.0|As a young child (born in 1980) I loved this movie, though I wasn't allowed to see it in its entirety until I was a young teenager. Filmed in my home state of NC, Dirty Dancing is a splendidly romantic film about a time (the early 1960s) and a place where life was much simpler by today's standards. The music is fantasic (this movie introduced me to Otis Redding), the dancing is even better, and Patrick Swayze absolutely makes the movie! He is not only an incredible dancer, but a fine actor as well. Though he was in his mid-thirties when the movie was made, he convincingly plays the somewhat older, jaded bad boy dance instructor with panache. Jennifer Grey is lithe, talented, and beautiful as Baby, the idealistic rich girl who falls in love with Johnny. Jerry Orbach is great as Baby's dad, and the other, lesser-known actors are great as well. Yes, sometimes the dialogue is corny, and the good-girl-loves-bad-boy plot is both unrealistic and familiar, but it is the way in which the actors portray these characters that they become memorable. This is the perfect girls' sleepover movie; in fact, I like to show a trilogy of romantic &quot;girl&quot; movies at my sleepovers: most notably Dirty Dancing, Shag, and School Ties. Sometimes I show Pretty in Pink, too. Watch this movie one hot summer night with one of your best gal pals!
B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce Springsteen has always have a strong personal integrity. He has always gone his own way in life. Against his father, and against the music buissness. When his father told him to be a lawyer and his mother wanted him to be a writer, he wanted to be a rock n' roll star. So he did. And got in trouble with his former manager, Mike Appel. Mike put him into a slavery contract, and after the fantastic album Born To Run, he wanted to break up from that contract. It took 2 years in court to break up from it, and Mr Springsteen was really angry. He wanted to go his own way in life, as he always have done. The result can you hear on this awsome album, probably the best album he has ever done. This is the punky Springsteen! Joe Strummer couldn't have done it better.<BR>On this album, Springsteen hasn't a star producer, cause he didn't want to. He let Jon Landau, a former music critic from the Rolling Stone Magazine, produce together with him. The sound is simpler and more raw, but it fit with the anger and strength in the songs. The songs are totally awsome! Do I have to say Badlands? What a song! A timeless masterpiece! Always something to say to us, even today! Full of hope and optimism, but also anger and strentgh. Factory: A song which is short and seems to be not much of a song, but listen what Springsteen has to say in that song... It's awsome! Adam rise a cain... Listen to the anger in that song...<BR>Racing in the street is wonderful as a ballad. Candy's room: Listen how nice Springsteen describe the prostituted woman that he met. He's a true human guy!<BR>All songs are fantastic!<BR>And if you really want to know how good Springsteen was that year, listen to the Winterland Night bootleg! Then you know how really awsome he really is...<br />You HAVE TO buy this album!! Or DIE!!
B00007LTIA|5.0|I reviewed the original version of \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" back in October 2002.  More recently I purchased this expanded two CD version from Rhino that includes not only the original four tracks, but a studio run-through of \\"Dance of the Dawn\\" and \\"Giants Under the Sun.\\"  Jon Anderson's vocals sound a bit thready and weak in the studio run-through, and the harmonies have yet to be added, yet, there is a certain charm to these run-throughs and the music is powerful.<br /><br />\\"Tales\\" is a deeply philosophical album that is not for the meditative faint of heart.  While much music is created to be toe-tapping and easy to sing to, \\"Tales\\" is in that genre usually called progressive rock, in a sub-genre that requires intense analysis to understand.  The result is an album that is inaccessible and incomprehensible to a casual listener.  In order to understand this music you must read the lyrics and listen, and listen, and then listen some more.  Even then you might fail to gain a glimmer of Yes' intent.<br /><br />\\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" would have to qualify as one of the most if not the most deeply complicated rock music ever created.  Again, if you are a casual listener the complexity of the music can be frustrating or boring.  However, if you consider that classical music is often complex, and to be understood requires extended focused listening, it should be of little surprise that Yes took that complexity for its own in the development of this music, creating a symphony in four movements.<br /><br />The first movement is titled \\"The Revealing Science of God: Dance of the Dawn\\". The lyrics have no meaning, and they also have meaning. Confusing? Oh yeah. Understand that the point of the movement is to get the listener to realize that there are bits and pieces of knowledge, and understanding is something that rarely, if ever, comes all at once. Jon Anderson uses the sound of the words to create an almost subliminal meaning. The whole point is that you are to realize that we do not understand, but we have to keep trying to understand.  Also, when you find meaning, know that you found it within yourself.<br /><br />The second movement is \\"The Remembering: High the Memory\\". This song is about the breadth of knowledge that is available to humankind and to any one individual. However, the song is also trying to say that while that knowledge is available, each of us can only access that knowledge when it becomes a part of our personal knowledge, and more than just having it as personal knowledge, it must be accessible and understood to be useful. Another way of saying this is that we have realms of knowledge that are potentially available to each of us. However, only that knowledge which we personally understand and can access will be of any value to us.<br /><br />The third movement is \\"The Ancient: Giants under the Sun\\". The concept of this song is relatively simple compared to the first two movements. This song pushes through the envelope of recorded time to access forgotten knowledge from civilizations that came before. While the song is relatively easy to understand, the music is more interwoven and complex, and intertwines elements that are intended to evoke those earlier cultures. Therefore, the instruments flavor this movement with musical elements from around the globe to help give the feeling that the song of our knowledge is made up of many parts from many people. While the music sounds relatively simple, it is as technically detailed and complex as any concerto or symphony I can recall. While Steve Howe's guitar may be pivotal in this song according to Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman's keyboards are essential to the ethnicity of the various portions of the music. This track is an incredible composition. This movement adds to the seeking of the first movement and the understanding of the second movement that there is knowledge yet available to be discovered from all cultures and civilizations that may no longerexist, but that understanding is still available if we know where and how to look for it.<br /><br />The fourth and final movement is \\"Ritual: Nous Sommes Du Soleil\\". This composition is relatively accessible philosophically because it is a description of the human condition. This piece is intended to communicate that we have the ability to seek knowledge and understanding. Part of that knowledge and understanding is the constant struggle between good and evil, and how that struggle plays a part of how we view that knowledge. However, this piece also reinforces the earlier movements in that we have the ability learn and to understand granted by a higher power.<br /><br />I've read that Rick Wakeman complained that there was too much filler in this composition. I suppose that could be said of many of the classical compositions by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Bach, and on and on. However, I've also read that Steve Howe thought that this was some of his best work ever. This work is magnificent in conception and scope. It is not readily accessible to the casual listener. The very best way to understand this music is to get a bottle of really good wine, sit in the middle of the room in a recliner, turn out most or all of the lights, and listen and feel. Start by paying attention to the emotion and feeling of the words, because that was the intent of the lyrics. Once you begin to understand what was intended, then this work becomes accessible. It is one of the most incredibly complex pieces of music I've ever heard, and I have listened to everything from classical to death metal.

0385336810|4.0|Having read Sophie Kinsella's &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series, I was very hopeful that I might find a new set of characters and scenarios which proved to be, once again, extremely endearing and humorous.  Sophie Kinsella has definitely delivered!  Emma Corrigan is a very fun-loving, delightful, lovable, no-nonsense kind-of British gal.  I find the predictaments in which she finds herself to be hilarious, yet so believable that I found myself getting embarrassed for her!  This novel truly had the power to take me away from my current surroundings and escape into a world that always seems to become more comical and complicated than what I usually predict from the typical genre.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This was the most horrendous thing I had ever heard!  I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it.  The only good song on the whole album is &quot;Toxic&quot; and that is due to it's catchy beat.  Britney is not a bad artist at all.  She has had some great songs in the past.  She just doesn't do it for me at all with this album.  She went too overboard on a lot of the songs, overdoing the remixing and focusing far less on her vocal abilities.  This is not worth the money I paid for it - in fact, I gave the CD away.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|&quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; is Stanley Kubrick's forgotten &quot;masterpiece&quot;.  Sandwiched chronologically between &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971)  and &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), it has received less adulation from the press and public than some of Kubrick's other triumphs (&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;;  &quot;2001:  A Space Odyssey&quot;) and did poorly at the box office upon its initial release in 1975.  <br />Based on the 1844 William Makepeace Thackeray novel &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot; (with some of the usual artistic liberties that Kubrick often took with his adaptations of books) this film follows the travails of Redmond Barry, an 18th century, hot-headed, charmingly unscrupulous Irish rapscallion who will stop at nothing to join the ranks of the British aristocracy.<br />Through a series of mishaps and misadventures, we follow Barry from his native Ireland through the Seven Years' War (1756-63), through the grand gambling palaces of Europe where he eventually woos and marries the beautiful and wealthy Lady Lyndon and adopts her name, much to the chagrin of her son Lord Bullingdon, who vows never to let Barry achieve his dream of joining the gentry.<br />Kubrick's ace-in-the-hole is his D.P. John Alcott who deservedly won an Oscar for Best Cinematography.  Shot in Ireland, Germany and England, the viewer constantly gets the feeling of viewing a classic 18th century painting.  It never gets dull watching the absolute beauty of this film, and I personally marvelled at all the hard work that must have gone into making it.<br />The music is also wonderful, as Kubrick once again shows excellent taste in which music fits a particular scene.  The film's opening scenes have gorgeous Irish folk music from The Chieftains, and its later passages are eloquently followed by the works of J.S. Bach and Vivaldi...and are repeated so often it's impossible for their concertos not to get stuck in your head!<br />The acting itself is above average, but somewhat mixed.  Ryan O'Neal is adequate as Barry Lyndon, although his attempts at an Irish accent are so-so at best.  He frequently fades into his SoCal drawl during the film.  He manages to hold the film together, but he is not its strongest performer.  Marisa Berenson (Lady Lyndon) isn't given much to do here, but she makes the most of her isolation and melancholy.  The true stars are Leon Vitali (disgustingly weasely and sadly sympathetic as the adult Lord Bullingdon) and Murray Melvin (the cold, restrained Reverand Runt).  Both actors steal every scene which features them.  I got the feeling that Kubrick focused so much on the photography of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; that the film's acting suffered as a result.  Maybe Kubrick wanted to illustrate the coldness of the British upper classes.  If so, then mission accomplished.  <br />Much has been noted of this film's &quot;coldness&quot; and much of it is deserved.  Michael Hordern's narration helps explain the historical context to the viewer and gives a human perspective to things, but sometimes takes away from some of the film's drama.  Despite the valid accusations of coldness, it should be noted that there is restrained passion here in certain scenes (especially between the young Redmond Barry and his first love, his cousin Nora Brady) and that you'll be hard-pressed to find ANY Kubrick film with large amounts of emotional warmth.  <br />Another thing that merits mentioning is the film's pacing and length.  It clocks in at 3 hours and 4 minutes, and the final climax between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon is UNBELIEVEABLY slow.  I highly recommend taking a snack break or a quick walk during the film's intermission.  If you're looking for fast-paced action, this is not the place to find it.  However, if you are willing to be challenged and allow yourself to slowly follow the 18th century aristocratic pace of life, you will enjoy this film.<br />Perhaps ironically for such an ornate film, the DVD itself does not come with many frills aside from a theatrical trailer.  No commentaries, no behind-the-scenes documentaries, no cast biographies.  <br />Overall, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; is definitely quality viewing for the Stanley Kubrick enthusiast.  This movie is decidedly NOT mainstream Hollywood fare, and is a challenging and beautiful examination of the mores and prejudices of 18th century European high society.

I am waiting for A Feast for Crows to come out now, and so I can enjoy another one of GRRM's masterpieces.<br />This particular tale starts off the series, it is basically an introduction book to this series. But it is worth the eight dollars you spend on it. In fact it is worth alot more, I think.<br />In my opinion it is 2x better than any Tolkein book

It is also about a association called the NSA and it has a invincible code breaking machine that can break any code it is givin but it had encountered one such code it is unable to crack. When this had occured the agency had called in their top cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, she is also an beautiful and smart mathematician. She had uncovered such a secret that the NSA is being held hostage by not guns or terrorists, but a CODE. It was unable to break and it held the intelligence of the U.S. hostage. She also has a lover and in the end she fought for not her country, but the lives of her loved ones and in the end. Well to find that out you should read this book. Its not that i liked or disliked this book, its that i was well pleased but in times dissapointed with the scenes. I was confused in certain times because Dan Brown had changed the scene without me even knowing. I had learned many things from this book and it also showed me a new code that had brought glamorous news to my life. I had confused many people and brought them to understand many new things. This bok also got me thinking if their is any secret organizations that is keeping this world in peace and not caos. This book compared to others had taught me more things in life than any before were able to. It taught me self confidence and how to think for myself and not ask others for help.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Here's a band that has sold millions of albums, but you begin to wonder what the fuss is all about after listening to them.  Linkin Park is one of many bands out there doing the rap/rock thing, but the vocals are relatively unimpressive - Mike Shinoda has a lifeless monotone delivery and Chester Bennington has a voice that often sounds like a dying vulture.  <br />To Linkin Park's credit, their lyrics tap into an angst theme which is pretty much universal; however, unlike what you hear on some recordings (example: Korn's s/t album), the angst seems contrived rather than genuine.  I'm not saying that the feelings expressed on the first album were not written from the heart, but this album just has this vibe about it that says \\"We have nothing to be angry about any more, but since our last album sold X amount of copies, why fix what isn't broken?\\", rather than challenging themselves with different subjects.  To that end, expect the same themes (i.e. How could you do this to me, I'm in so much pain, You can't feel my anguish) that were present on Hybrid Theory.  Writing is a particular weakness for this band - a lack of inspiration explains the brevity of both of their albums, which only run about 37 minutes long each.<br />These criticisms aside, the band does have a penchant for writing memorable hooks - tracks like \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Faint\\" and \\"Lying From You\\" are quite catchy and the vitriol is delivered with conviction.  However, the structure of many of these songs sounds awfully familiar - \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" follows a pattern similar to \\"In The End\\", and try singing the lyrics of \\"Crawling\\" over \\"Numb\\" ... they're pretty much the same song, complete with Shinoda's minimal contribution (the occasional muttering of the phrase \\"caught in the undertow\\").  <br />In summary: Linkin Park is decent, but highly overrated.  They would be well served to spend more time on their weak areas (mainly the writing and vocals) in order to live up to all the hype.  But since the masses have proclaimed their two albums as masterpieces, what would be the point?
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie is well acted, well scripted, well...it's just a well done movie. It portrays life as it actually is, without the glamour of hollywood. They manage to capture the beauty of the seemingly insignificant relationships that you have throughout your life. How a momentary sharing between strangers can change your outlook on life. In short, this movie is about life. The problem with that, is that we get to deal with life every day. I watch a movie to be entertained, to be swept elsewhere; not to be carried back into my parents house. I am glad that I viewed the movie, but will never see it again.  :o)
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Well, I have to say that this album is really enjoyable.  There are some tracks that I like to listen to over and over again, and there are some that I don't really like at all.  But that said, overall, this album is pretty good.  Britney is always saying in her interviews that she wants to be more mature with her music and this album really accomplishes that.  She no longer sounds like a bouncy pop queen as in her ...baby one more time or oops I did it again days.  The fast songs on this album is all about club/dance.  She sings with more conviction and aggression, often trying to rap and let out the lyrics in a swift flow.  She does use a lot of synthesizers, as she sounds completely computer generated on some tracks, but it works with the direction of the album, which is good clubby electronic-pop music.  This can be seen on songs such as \\"I got that (boom boom),\\" \\"Toxic,\\" and \\"Outrageous.\\"<br />A sampling of the songs I like on this album:<br />Me Against the Music: this track is with Madonna, and after listening to it a few times, I found myself liking it more and more.  It is a good pairing that seems to feed off each other.  They are two entertaining women, and they work well together in this song.    <br />I got that (boom boom): this song is done with the ying yang twinz and it's your typical dance/southern hip hop song, which seems very prevalent on the air these days.  Smart move, hooking up with this genre, Britney.  <br />Toxic: When I first heard this song, I knew it would be a sure hit.  The hook is great and it is nicely crafted pop song.  It is the typical Britney song that has made her so popular over the years, it's fun, the chorus is catchy and seductive, and it definitely brings people to the dance floor.  <br />Outrageous: This song is another one of those songs that you can't help but get up and dance to.  She has many of them, but this one sticks out because it's got that Middle Eastern beat. The chorus is pounded into your head as she describes how outrageous her sex drive, her shopping sprees, her sexy jeans, and her world tour are.  R. Kelly does it again--it really seems like either he or Lil Jon is in every song on the radio.   <br />Touch of my hand: well, I guess a song about this topic had to be done by Britney sometime.  Apparently, Ms. Spears has matured a great deal from her last album, if she's taking on the topic of self love.  It's actually a fairly good song. It's got a cool Eastern feel to it and again, she sounds seductive.  But how could she not, when singing about the \\"touch of her hand.\\" <br />Shadow:  This is my favorite ballad of the album.  It is a little dull, and there's nothing that special about it, but some reason, the country like forlorn quality in her voice in this song gets me.  The swell of the music as she departs into the chorus is beautiful.  <br />Brave New Girl:  This is a very computer generated song.  I have no idea what she is saying most of the time because her voice is so mixed up, but this is a great dance tune.  It's very upbeat and bouncy and again it accomplishes the theme--get people out on the dance floor to party.  There is a funky beat in the background and her quick delivery of the lyrics is energizing.  The chorus is awesome, it's really infectious.  <br />There you have it, those are my favorites on the album.  Any fan of Britney's will enjoy this album, and even if you are not a diehard fan, there are worthy cuts on this record.  If you absolutely dislike Britney for some odd reason, on this record she may surprise you.  The record is different enough from the last three that you may end up changing your attitude towards her.  Definitely check this out if you are a fan of this genre.
0385504209|5.0|A book filled with great information! The plot is simply designed to parcel out all of this fascinating stuff!

0060934913|4.0|KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is the story of drug-taking in the stockroom, knife-fights in the kitchen, and lovemaking behind the bar.  It's supposedly an expose of what really goes on in the surprisingly gritty world of restauranteering, where life is more violent and dangerous than meets the eye.  It's an entertaining, hilarious and engaging read.  Is it completely 100% accurate?  I'm not qualified to answer that, but I feel emboldened enough to state that I don't really care much.  The result is far too satisfying to worry about little details like accuracy.<br />Anthony Bourdain has paid his dues; he leaves you in no doubt about that.  Starting with a love of food that began during his childhood, he tells the story of his slow rise from a variety of seedy and shady slop-houses to the ultimate in chefdom: a paid gig advising a French chef on the proper way to serve French food (albeit in a restaurant in Japan that wants a New York flavor).<br />As one might expect, it's Bourdain's bizarre associates who provide the book with many of its memorable moments.  From a co-worker who has to be fended off at knifepoint, to the various drug-addicts who appear to populate every kitchen known to humanity, these people just cracked me up.  There's an entire chapter devoted to a guy called Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, who is, in all fairness, an absolute madman; one could easily imagine an whole book about this guy and his brushes with the law, his bakery experiments, his regular overdoses, etc.  Tellingly, this Adam guy is fairly representative of the memoir as a whole.<br />Bourdain's book bounces his around various dingy kitchens, looking for places to alternatively cook or intoxicate himself (he laments his short stay in Baltimore, a city he loathed, seemingly because he didn't know where to score drugs).  This is not a memoir for the sensitive reader, and not just for the reasons of finding out what's really in the soup you just ordered (although the book does occasionally wander into this territory).  Most of the time, I was laughing like a loon, even if the thought that I might have eaten in places like these made me cringe.  <br />Again, while I kept getting the feeling that he was exaggerating his story, he does disclaim that this book is fairly accurate, that he wanted to write a book that anyone in the industry could pick up and instantly identify with.  Perhaps he's right, and that the restaurant business is infinitely seedier than I could have imagined.  And, if so, I'm at least glad that it provides us with a memoir as wildly entertaining as this one.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a brilliant movie, but it's not for everyone. In some of the reviews here it's shown as a victim of its own huge success. Thanks in part to Sofia Coppola's well-deserved screenwriting Oscar it's pulled in audiences who have neither the inclination nor movie-going equipment to handle a movie of this kind. <br />To longtime serious-movie audiences it's probably a lot easier to deal with. It's not the kind of movie that could ever hope to appeal to the Matrix or X-Men 2 crowd. <br />It's more in the vein of serious cinema from independent film-makers like Jim Jarmusch, or some Wayne Wang. Or European film makers like Wim Wenders. If some people found THIS slow, I hate to think what they'd say about the superb &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; or Visconti's &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. All superb films.<br />So no it's not for everyone. If it IS to your taste, you WILL be able to see why so many have raved with enthusiasm for it. And forget the idiocies about &quot;racism&quot;. Noticing CULTURAL differences that do exist is observation not racism. There is no element of nastiness in Coppola's vision. The girl is a talent, and will - I hope - go on to even greater things.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|The kings of progressive metal, Dream Theater, have triumphiantly, albeit quickly returned with another strong effort. This time around, they've rewinded back to &quot;Awake,&quot; their 1994 release, in an attempt at a heavier, darker sound. There is no arguing that DT has achieved this goal on the new release, Train of Thought. However, they've evidently sacrificed a lot of the artistry and creativity they're known for. The guitar riffs are more plain and are more driven towards being heavy rather than gripping like in the past. Frankly, it grows quite boring. Mike Portnoy somehow wields a triple-bass drum kit for this opus. His drumming is absolutely insane, powerful, and lightning-fast, but I think this time it was more of playing as fast as you can rather than making good, proportionate music. John Myung's bass is heard better on this album, which is one of the more positive points this time around. Jordan Rudess' keyboards are drowned out as always, rendering them virtually pointless in most cases, but soar above the music quite nicely. Despite the flaws, DT are on top of their game talent-wise and have never played such difficult music, but the actual songwriting soils what could've been one of the great albums in prog history. Now I bring you to quite possibly the worst aspect of this release: James Labrie. If you are anything like me, you must've thought it couldn't have gotten any worse for James after his awful and incredibly lackluster effort on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Well, I'm sure I'm not the only one that was wrong. He has taken such a decline since his excellent performance on his debut, Images and Words. In many instances on Train of Thought, he's simply flat-out irritating. His operatic voice has shrunken to somewhat of a nu-metal-esque whine. Enough of that, now I'll analyze the songs:<br />&quot;As I Am&quot; is very commercial, perhaps harkening back to Falling Into Infinity, the attempt at a radio-friendly album that lost DT a lot offans, let alone respect. A terrible, annoying chorus is made up for by an incredibly fast and amazing solo by John Petrucci. &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; is perhaps the worst song on the album, James Labrie's vocals are absolutely terrible. This is a weak follow-up to the epic &quot;Glass Prison.&quot; &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; is arguably the best song on the album, an emotional journey that doesn't have nearly as many flaws as the other songs. &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; hones several riffs that fail at their tries to be heavy, and James Labrie goes as low as to rap at one part (yes, you heard me, RAP), and scream like a troubled old hag. &quot;Vacant&quot; is a melancholy and short piece with cellos and violins, a prelude to the monster Liquid Tension Experiment-esque instrumental &quot;Stream of Consciousness,&quot; which is also possibly the best track on the album, if just for the absence of James. Myung's bass groves shine on this piece. The album closes with &quot;In The Name of God,&quot; a decent but repetitive epic about war in the Middle East.<br />Dream Theater have upped the length of their songs and offer only seven progressive metal behemoths. It is for you to decide whether or not this is a good idea. So in conclusion, I'd recommend you get this Dream Theater album last in your Dream Theater collection. Its a decent album, but bad by DT standards. Don't have the high expections many others did.
B000002J27|4.0|A trick of the tail released back in 1976 is The first Genesis release Phil Collins marks his vocal debut. Several years has<BR>passed since i heard this recording &amp; about 2 years ago i was lisening to my entire collection of rock music on vinyl and tape<BR>and i came across &quot;A TRICK OF THE TAIL&quot; put the record on and was truly amazed on how good the sound still was espcally songs<BR>like &quot;DANCE ON A VOLCANO&quot; &quot;ROBBERY, ASSUALT, &amp; BATTERY&quot; such powerful progressive rock that it ages like fine wine and never goes out of style. I beileve there isn't as much focus on the music of Gennesis Before 1980 the Year When the Phenominal album &quot;DUKE&quot; was released and that is a shame because there is a lot of great Gennesis Material that Radio &amp; the general public never knew existed from 1973 To 1978 that has also never been   appreicated for It's musical Orginality &amp; Integrity.

Stunningly lush and brilliant, the tunes are daisy chained together to provide a wonderful listen. Time after time. No need to mention how underrated Jeff Lynne, that's a known. Sweet Talkin' Woman, Birmingham Blues, Across The Border, Wild West Hero, Steppin Out' to name a few. This is ELO's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Let's face it, if this isn't on your wish list, well, you figure it out!
0452284937|5.0|This book was so fascinating that I could not put it down.  It brings you back in time, focusing on the way of life in the 17th century.  The life of the maid in an artist's home and surrounding people in the home shows dynamic relationships.  The characters are real and the book flows with the natural course of everyday life.
B00005JN1L|4.0|David Koepp's SECRET WINDOW is well-paced (even if it is a bit slow) and suspenseful (even if you can figure out the ending from about the midway point). It is also superbly acted. Johnny Depp gives yet another bravura performance as an emotionally haunted writer going through a bitter divorce who tries to escape in a lonely cabin in upstate New York. He receives a visit from a strange man from Mississippi, played believably by Brooklyn-bred John Turturro, who says simply, \\"Yew stole mah storay.\\" This sets a chain of events into place that are fascinating as the film unfolds in true suspenseful roller-coaster-like fashion. Johnny Depp has some really funny lines in his many soliloquies. Also featured in solid supporting roles are Charles S. Dutton, Len Cariou and Timothy Hutton.<br />See SECRET WINDOW now. It is one of the better Stephen King adaptations.<br />RECOMMENDED<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR SUSPENSE (AND JOHNNY DEPP) FANS

B00013F38K|4.0|I have waited eagerly for this dvd. I have not seen this program since I was a child, and while it does not quite live up to uncritical childhood memories, it is ,in my estimation, still one of the best tv series I have ever seen. It was this program that helped lead me to take a philosophy degree, as well as to study the martial arts. <BR> From a more technical point of view, the quaility of the film stock seemed surpisingly good. I did notice in one scene where two tight face shots ( in the Tides) seemed a little cropped ( this is where perhaps the widescreen format may have been a hinderance), but on the whole I am grateful that I do not have to join the Warner video of the month club, and that I get to see the series that served as a stimulus for some rather valued aspects of my life. <BR> Now, if I could reflect of the flashbacks within the series, and practice hung gar more diligently, perhaps I cold get more out of life.
B000005L86|5.0|Dear Amazon reader: I'm sure you've seen many albums that receive 5 star averages, but when you look at the individual reviews, there are always those people who give an album 1 or 2 stars for whatever &quot;reasons&quot; (haters abound).  Notice, though, that as of this posting, this album has gotten 5 stars from EVERYONE, minus a few 4 star ratings scattered about.  That should say it all - 'Heart of the Congos' is divine...like Desmond Dekker said - &quot;beautiful and dangerous&quot;.
B000002NJS|5.0|After (...), fans have wondered if Madonna was ever going to tone it down, and she proved that with a turn-around hit album \\"Ray of Light.\\" This is probably her best album, with her new found persona of celebrating her 40s and bringing spirituality, yoga, deeper lyrics, abstract thoughts, and new dance grooves. \\"Skin\\" is perhaps her new [attractive] ode from \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"The Power of Love\\". Her lyrics were more personal (\\"I traded fame for love, without a second thought/It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought), and \\"Swim\\" is perhaps one of my personal favorite lines \\"Children killing children while the students rape their teachers/Comets flying across the sky while the churches burn their preachers\\". Her lyrics are rawer than ever and her praise is well-deserved.
B000002B7U|5.0|I have a soft spot for The Ultimate Sin because it was the first Ozzy tape I bought right when it came out.  I saw the cool music video for &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; on MTV's Headbanger's Ball with the heavy metal groupie who becomes the leather-clad, big-haired album cover girl on a billboard when she becomes possessed during an Ozzy concert and knew I had to get the album.  I know Ozzy does not care for &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; (he states inside the cover of the Just Say Ozzy EP that he was &quot;happier&quot; with the live version of that track on that little live album than he was with the original here) but I think it is an excellent track and convinced me to buy the album back in 1986/7.  I also think guitarist Jack E. Lee was unfairly criticized because he was replacing a legend in Randy Rhoads.  The guitar work here is amazing.  Listen to the acoustic opening of &quot;Killer of Giants.&quot;  It is beautiful!  <br />No weak songs here, although a few deserve special mention.  The title track is an excellent opening.  It really rocks.  The more interesting songs are the obviously &quot;Cold War&quot; inspired tracks like &quot;Killer of Giants&quot; (again, if you have not heard the acoustic opening of this track, get this album right away!) and &quot;Thank God for the Bomb.&quot;  The latter track on the subject of deterrence through the arms race takes a different stand than one would expect from the music world: &quot;War is just another game tailor made for the insane, but make a threat of their annihilation, and nobody wants to play.  If that's the only thing that keeps the peace then thank God for the bomb.&quot;  Sound's like Reagan's military policy.  One track here that I find to be amazing but have not see on compilations is &quot;Secret Loser.&quot;  It is one of my favorite Ozzy songs.  It just rocks!  And the guitar work is amazing, especially during the bridge.  I've played this song over and over many times!  It is addicting but I doubtit ever wound up on Ozzy's live set list in recent years.  I like Ultimate Sin better than any Ozzy album to follow (including No More Tears). I recommend it to any Ozzy fan or '80s &quot;metal&quot; fan.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Zeppelin has always been my favorite band and Bonham my favorite drummer.  I am a drummer and have always idolized Bonham but never had a chance to see his true ability being too young to see them live.  I had always heard how hard hitting Bonham was but you can never experience it until you see his solo in this DVD.  The ferocity and intensity in this solo is awe inspiring.  The 30 minute solo blows my mind.  To see the speed and power he had is short of otherworldly.  Neil Peart has always been a favorite of mine, but he uses many drums and a lot of different sounds to get his sound out, but bonham uses a basic drumkit and ghost beats to a level I have never experienced.<br />As for the rest of Zep, it is truly amazing that the 4 greatest musicians of all time managed to be in the same group.  After watching the DVD you realize how revelutionary and ahead of there time they were.  Especially the Finnish radio show!<br />tuen it up and enjoy.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I am normally one of these people who cringe at people of a certain age 'making out' or heaven forbid, 'doing it'. I was going to scream if I saw Jack Nicholson naked. Thankfully, we didn't, (...) And the [adult] scenes were done tastefully, and was quite sweet at the same time. Diane Keaton is also very brave, as she appears naked in this, which is quite a funny scene when Jack sees her naked. It takes a brave woman of her age to appear naked, especially when she's approaching 60!<br />I'm not normally a great fan of Jack Nicholson, ask anyone and they will tell you his eyes totally freak me out! Don't ask me why! But I loved him in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and this too - and there were two other Jack Nicholson movies in the \\"previews\\", Anger Management and that other one with Helen Hunt.<br />There was a great supporting cast in this, including Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky for all you fans out there) and Jon Favreau, both who's roles could have been expanded, to have a bigger part in the movie.<br />I was pretty disappointed with Keanu's role in this. He basically gets messed about by Diane Keaton's character, and his role at the end just gets left hanging. Hello, he proposed, he's not going to give up without a fight! <br />At 2 hours 8 minutes long, this film was about 20 minutes too long. After Diane & Jack 'get it on', the scenes which appear afterwards are just stupid, and the scene where Diane cries is just plain embarrassing. <br />If you're an old romantic at heart, you'll get quite teary by the end of the movie. If you're not - then you'll probably hate it.
B000089CKH|4.0|I can't begin to count the number of CDs I have purchased in the last few years solely on the basis of one track.  And sadly, the rest of the CD rarely lives up to that one song. This is NOT one of those CDs.  Although I bought it because of &quot;Inside of Love&quot;, I was surprised at the excellent lyrical and instrumental content of the rest of the CD.  The band is capable of a wide variety of styles and this CD really showcases their musical talent, especially the acoustic guitar and drum tracks.  And no whiney teenage-angst vocals here, either. If you like &quot;Inside of Love&quot;, you're going to like this whole CD.
0385504209|4.0|I thought this was an incredible book, and the sheer amount of people that said it was so full of historical inaccuracies just made me want to read it more. IT'S A FICTIONAL BOOK! The fact that so many people are griping about its historical inaccuracies is a true testament to how well it's written. These people are acting, like it's claiming to be a nonfiction book!<br />I've read the true facts of the Da Vinci code, and for the amount of facts in the book it's surprising of how many ARE true. This book is still a wealth of knowledge; from religious symbolism to the mathematical golden ratio you learn a lot reading it. Plus, its gripping. the storyline keeps you guessing and makes you proud when you figure something out before the characters do.<br />I enjoyed Angels and Demons more, but this still goes on my great book category
B00000I9MK|5.0|Great album.   The rhythm to \\"Electronic Renaissance\\" is quite similar to that on Pat Benetar's \\"Love is a battlefield,\\" which I find quite amusing.   Great song.  Also a great song is \\"The State I am in.\\"  I love the tambourine in that song when they reference Veronica in the song \\"Expectations.\\" .<BR>Another great track is \\"I could be dreaming.\\"  I love the way the music is layered at the end of the song and Isobel speaks/reads while the guitar progressively gets louder and louder.
B0001611DI|5.0|Few filmmakers now how to do a zombie movie and get it right; I hate to think what the zombie movie genre would be without George Romero.  1968's Night of the Living Dead is still the archetype of zombie films, in my opinion, featuring a virtually perfect ending.  1979's follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, is another true classic, featuring scenes so shocking that absolutely no one under 17 could be admitted to theaters to see it.  By today's standards, the film is hardly shocking at all, but Romero's up close and personal look at a nihilistic world simply crawling with the undead is the kind of movie that makes horror lovers stand up and cheer.  The level of violence in this film is delightfully high; sure, it all looks pretty fake now, but in its day Dawn of the Dead helped lay the groundwork for later gorefests full of blood and guts.<br />I don't, as a general rule, care for zombies or zombie movies.  Zombies are ugly and stupid - they basically just wander around in a clumsy manner, only reacting to the nearness of human life fresh for the taking (and eating).  That's about all they do here, as well, but at least they turn out in huge numbers for this George Romero classic.  We don't know what started the trouble; as the movie opens, the world is already in a heap of a mess.  There are cops and soldiers killing zombies by the dozens, but it's obviously just a few bloods drops in the proverbial bucket.<br />TV news coverage features experts saying how bad everything is and how we should have taken action sooner, demanding people leave their self-barricaded homes and come together in a dwindling number of central locations.  Roger DeMarco (Scott H. Reiniger) flies his girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and friend Stephen Andrews (David Emge) out of town in a helicopter - Stephen's sharp-shooting buddy Peter Washington (Ken Foree) also comes along for the ride.  Low on gas and unsure of what they should do, the gang lands on the roof of a large shopping mall and eventually decides to hole up there for a while.  Isolating themselves upstairs, our would-be survivors then begin making forays inside the mall for necessary supplies.  The place is crawling with pasty-faced zombies, so they put together a plan that will, or so they hope, keep additional zombies from gaining access to the site; once that is done, it's just a matter of killing all of the zombies already stumbling around inside.  Of course, as we all know, people are stupid, so this prolonged stay inside the mall faces its share of challenges and dangers.  Along the way, countless numbers of zombies are shot, bludgeoned, and taken out with whatever deadly instruments one happens to find handy.  Never fear, there is some zombie feeding as well, although once again I have to express my disappointment that no brains were ever eaten (zombies are supposed to eat brains - that's my personal zombie philosophy).  One question hovers near the front of your mind throughout this film: how will it end?  The world has basically come to an end, making for some long odds for our heroes' survival.  While the ending is not completely satisfying, I do believe it makes for a right and fitting conclusion to this most extraordinary of horror classics.<br />Let me speak to the violence portrayed here.  However shocking it was upon the movie's release, it really isn't shocking at all in this day and age; the quantity of violence, though still impresses.  Plenty of zombies fall over the course of these two hours plus, but few of the &quot;deaths&quot; are what I would call gory.  In many cases, a zombie takes a shot between the eyes and falls down; in some cases there is blood, especially when zombies get a chance to do a little feeding, but you certainly won't see anybody lying in a pool of blood.  In many cases, a zombie gets taken out with no blood at all - certainly, the amount of gore you would expect from shotgun blasts to the head just doesn't exist here.  The blood, I might also mention, doesn't even look like blood - unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling me.<br />In the end, it comes down to this: Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made - more than that, it's one of the best horror films ever made.  It cemented George Romero's name in the hallowed shrines of horror; it crossed the Rubicon (or perhaps I should say the river Styx) and dared to give viewers the quantity of senseless violence so many of us crave.  There is also a sociological slant to the movie that many feel compelled to comment on (I personally think it's something of a stretch to classify four desperate, would-be survivors as some type of bourgeoisie enjoying the luxury the shopping mall affords them while the nameless hordes of plebeian zombies mill around aimlessly).  However you want to interpret it, Dawn of the Dead is horror at its very best, up close and in your face.oesn't even look like blood - unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling me.<br />In the end, it comes down to this: Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made - more than that, it's one of the best horror films ever made.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are A LOT of positive reviews here, and I think they're all well earned.  I want to address the negative ones, however.  <br />One common complaint is the abruptness of Firefly's end.  While it's true that many questions are left unanswered, there is hope for people who want to see how everything turns out.  Creator Joss Whedon wrote a script for a film and Universal Studies plans to release the result sometime in 2005.  Whedon will direct and the original cast will be back.<br />Others complain about the Western Space Opera motif.  I wasn't a fan of the concept when I heard of it, and I didn't have a chance to see the show on TV, but I made a point to give it a chance on Joss Whedon's track record.  Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this TV show is much, much more than it appears.  Watch the first episode, &quot;Serenity&quot; (also the name of the movie), and judge for yourself.  &quot;Objects in Space,&quot; &quot;Ariel,&quot; and &quot;Out of Gas&quot; are all masterpieces.  A couple of episodes aren't as good, namely, &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot;  But the good here far, far outweighs the bad.<br />The last point I want to make is just that Firefly is one of TV's best shows.  And, yes, nobody watched it, but sometimes diamonds go unnoticed.  This is one of them.
B000002MJC|5.0|I am a chill, nonconfrontational guy.  But when I see people dissing this album here on Amazon, my blood boils and I want a way to meet them and have a very heated conversation disagreeing with them and telling them they are complete and utter idiots for not liking the album.  It is Depeche Mode's best work to date.  The sound has not aged at all, and if it was released today, no one would raise eyebrows wondering if it was really made in present time.  The entire sound is completely original and unique.  Everything comes together...guitar, synth, vocals, everything.  The sound is incredibly edgy and melodic and amazing at the same time.  Just incredible.  The music has true emotion and heart, nothing sounds fake or routine or contrived or badly programmed.  It's real and a perfect emotional overflow of genius.  Even all the remixed and b-sides from this era are great.  The maxi singles are worth your money.  As for the album at hand, songs like &quot;Walking In My Shoes,&quot; &quot;Mercy In You,&quot; &quot;In Your Room,&quot; &quot;Rush,&quot; and &quot;Higher Love&quot; are my favorites. But everything's great.  A+ with a bar on top of the + to make it infinite.  Out of 900 something CDs I currently own, this one has been played the most by far.  Can never get sick of it, never gets old.  Has held its own ever since I bought it when i was 14 back in July of '95.  HOLLLAAA.  Once again, Depeche Mode's best work.  But, if you're new to Depeche Mode, I actually recommend starting with Black Celebration and Music For The Masses, then Violator, and then this album.  This will give you the chance to see a progression.  Then buy some earlier albums like A Broken Frame, Construction Time Again, and Some Great Reward, to see where they truly started, and then buy their later albums like Ultra and Exciter.  Finish your buying off with 101 and everything else they have released.  As far as Speak &amp; Spell...ehhh...Vince Clarke...let's just say he's no Martin Gore...I consider the TRUE Depeche Mode starting with A Broken Frame.  But there are still come catchy tunes on Speak &amp; Spell and I'm not dissing Vince, he's done a lot for music.  But it's not the dark and edgy Depeche Mode we all love.  HOLLLAAA.sider the TRUE Depeche Mode starting with A Broken Frame.  But there are still come catchy tunes on Speak &amp; Spell and I'm not dissing Vince, he's done a lot for music.

0312954468|5.0|Simply, this is the best Wilbur Smith story out there.  Masterfully told with excellent detail of the era.  Smith brings ancient Egypt alive for the reader in this story on a level that everyone can identify with, the common man's level - but with a twist - Tiata the slave is NOT a common man.  A slave becomes the savior of the empire and forever wins your heart.  While the story is somewhat gruesome at times, it reflects the trecherous and barbaric era accurately, and reminds us that civilization has not advanced mankind's basic nature in many, many ways.
B00004WGAI|5.0|'Is it better to drive a fellow creature to despair than to trangress a mere human law - no man being injured by the breach?'    'Still indomitable was the reply - 'I care for myself'.    'I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary'. 'Humbug! Most things free-born would submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant'.     I have read an re-read Jane Eyre several times and every time the book manages to amaze me with lines like the above. It seems to me that Charlotte Bronte wrote about ideas and feelings easily transferred to the 21st century. Which would explain the popularity of the novel. And maybe that is the one characteristic that distinguishes great literature from everything else written: the timeless quality of the ideas and feelings.    What I like about this 1983 adaptation of Jane Eyre is, that almost all of my favourite lines are there, keeping the best and the most romantic ones and deleting the more biblical references, which to a modern audience would be incomprehensible and dull anyway. The acting is superb and although I have read many reviews stating that Dalton might be too handsome and Clarke too old.. who cares? (The only weak spot in the acting might be the (French?) girl who plays Adele).  Age and appearences do not matter so much anymore when something is acted so well that you are almost spellbound.    I liked the theatrical feeling to this adaptation, no music played to disburb the beautifully written dialogues. This series depends on the suberb acting of the players and a well-written script. (BTW Bridewell is a London prison, which explains Dalton in chains when playing 'plain charades' in company, this part for me the only incomprehensible thing before I found out about Bridewell).    The Dalton/Clarke version displays all the depth of the main characters and their wealth of feelings. The video is well worth your money.    Every other Jane Eyre I have seen (and own) could not satisfy me, because the plotline was changed, it was poorly acted, important characters were deleted, the story moving too fast or the dialogue was written poorly and very incomprehensible. And most of the time it would be a combination of all things mentioned. Let's face it: like Austen's Pride and Prejudice this book can not be comprised in a mere two hours.    I am only waiting for the (uncut?) DVD version to be released. WHEN? I found the DVD version on Amazon.co.jp, but who can read Japanese? I certainly can't. Why was this series released in Japan and not in Europe or the USA? Anybody know the answer?    PS the uncut DVD version has been released in the USA on April 19th 2005 and I am the happy owner of it. What puzzles me is that it has not been released in the UK/ Europe.

0385504209|1.0|Watch out Michael Crichton, you've got competition. With \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" Dan Brown rivals you for one-dimensional characters, preposterous plot and misogynistic flourishes. However, he does you one better with his crypto-paranoid conspiracy theories centering around the Catholic church and forays into third-rate art criticism. The appeal of \\"Da Vinci\\" is mystifying, especially when Brown's \\"Angels and Demons\\" is a far better book, if you want a religious thriller. That one actually thrills. This one just makes you snicker with its completely inept writing style, character development and plot. Never has Paris been so slighted in fiction-this book is supposedly set in the Louvre but Brown's Louvre has all the atmosphere of a mall poster shop. If you must read a thriller, try Dean Koontz. If you must read Dan Brown, try \\"Angels and Demons.\\" This \\"Code\\" isn't worth cracking.

1881273156|2.0|Let me begin by saying that my mate and I are both well at ease with our own and each other's established love language styles. Of course it's difficult to place all the complexities of a person's &quot;relationship style&quot; completely within one of the five love languages cited in this book (quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch), but, using these five as a general guideline, my dominant love language is &quot;physical touch&quot;, while my mate's is &quot;acts of service&quot;. Our relationship functions reasonably well on this basis; if my mate starts moving out of her assigned love language style, as she is sometimes prone to do, I'm usually fairly quick to make sure she gets back into it.<br />However, despite being quite aware and mostly accepting of our respective love language styles, as recommended in this book, I sometimes suspect that this is not the full picture, and there is perhaps still something missing in our relationship in terms of communication. I'm not sure if perhaps there's something missing from my partner's copy of the book, and she's not fully grasping the issues? Her Spanish edition does seem to have fewer pages than my English copy...
1559408898|5.0|Robocop is deff. one of the most underated sci-fi movies out there. Being under the shadow of terminator it never got the respect it derserved. The criterion dvd is also amazing, robocop fans like myslef finally get to see the directors cut. The extra violent shots taken are out are pretty interesting and the commentary is also very good. This verison is currently out of print, but if you can get your hands on it, its worth every penny. It is rumored that MGM studios is re-releasing a robocop special edition, but I can assure robocop fans that it will not have the unrated director's cut, or commentary. In other words stick with the criterion version, Thier line of dvd's are amazing, and well worth the extra money.
B000002H70|5.0|When I was 14 I loved the smashing pumpkins siamese dream. I read an article that described the album as being textural and listed a bunch of textural albums - disintegration was among them. A friend of mine loved the cure so I figured I would check it out. I bought the album and did not particularly like it. Then... pictures of you grew on me..then love song grew on me..then disintegration. Within months i listened to the album beginning to end at least once a day. This is still my favourite album. If I ever learned to love art it is because of this album.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I Am John Charet, the guy who back in July and some other month<BR>insulting Gangs OF NEw York badly, well now I regret that and insulting the films of the millenium. Please forgive me for insulting the films of this millenium. The truth is I love Gangs Of New York and I love all filmmaking of the new millenium meaning the ones of 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond. I only insulted the films of today because a bunch of my friends, who only listen to the modern stuff always insult the entertainment from the past and it hurt my feelings bad, so I took my anger out by insulting this film and this decades filmmaking to see how they feel when somebody insults their stuff. However it was wrong of me to do that because the truth is I love the films of the new millenium. I think 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond rules and is awesome. I am growing up in a modern society which is what I love, we get DVD Players,<BR>the internet, Playstation 2, Xbox, and al neat stuff like the Video Games like GTA Vice CIty, Hitman, Manhunt, Backyard wrestling, FInal Fantasy Games, That new Indiana Jones Game. I am crying now that I insulted the decade I am growing up in now the new millenium which is truly awesome. I only insulted it because my friends were insulting some stuff that I liked from the past. So I wanted to see how they would feel by giving a test, which was insult their favorite things to see how they feel. The truth is though I love everything about 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond, I relly love those movies, in fact I own 67 dvd's of movies that were released in the 2000's or mellenium (Okay close to it). I am not lying, I really love the millenium, I just got upset that my friends were insulting some old movies. Sorry I went overboard on saying all movies from past decades were never gratuitous in terms of violence and stuff. Their were movies in terms of being gratuitous back then too, just like today in the new millenium being 2000, 2001,<BR>2002, 2003,2004, and beyond it's a combination like it was in the 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90,s big halves of films have lots of violence that's gratuitous and other big halves have lots of violence that's not gratuitous. It remains the same in the new millenium the 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond. In fact,<BR>I think their are strenghth's in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond that the past decades did not have. For example, people are more nicer now than they were in the 20th century, they don't rush you that much in terms. It would've sucked to grow up in the 70's or 80's since you did not have dvd's or internet or Playstation 2, or Xbox now that would be boring to not have any of that stuff. Saying that the 80's sucked in terms of people's behavior of greed and technology which is bogus to have no dvd's or Ps2's or internet. The 70's were probally good and the 90's big improvement nicer attitude's better tv like Tales From The Crypt, Hitchhiker. But The good decade is now 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond and shows like The Sopranos, Oz, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Deadwood are brilliant and awesome. Lord OF The RIngs Also Rule Return OF The King is excellent just like FOTR and TTT were. Troy with BRad Pitt looks awesome also. I am serious this millenium rules.<BR>On the movie Gangs Of New York now- Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director every movie he does I love- Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Casino are just of a few I can name and this is no exception along with Bringing out The Dead. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as Bill The Butcher his third best (After My Left Foot and In The Name Of The Father) performance. Dicaprio and Diaz are good too. The third best film<BR>of 2002 After The Pianist (Richly Deserved Oscars), LOTR TTT. Although I think this is the better movie, the musical Chicago comes close in brilliant entertainment that it winnning was no injustice. However I would have given Gangs Of New York the oscars for Film Editing, and Cinematography. This is anothr Scorsese winner, he never fails to entartain me. Believe what I just said I was just overreacting when I insulted this decade and this movie, I really love these things like 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond. I love all the technology we have today and movies are still excellent. The LOTR trilogy and Band Of Brothers top all other action movies. Oh yeah and flicks like XXX and The Rundown are just like Rambo and are fun to watch. I am telling the truth what I just said I love the movie, the movies of 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and beyond. Oh and DVD players, Playstation 2, and the internet. Please I am telling the truth in this review.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Boring adaptation of a Michael Crichton's novel in which a group of archaelogists are involved in a time travel adventure and find themselves obliged to fight in a medieval war between France and England. The movie is completely out of pace, although directed by a very known director (Richard Donner, who made 'Superman' and 'Lethal Weapon', full of cardboard situations and misses the point completely. In fact, 'Timeline' could have been a good time travel entry but is just a juvenile movie of sword fight.
B00004Z459|2.0|I have to admit, when I first heard their single &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, I loved it.  The fact that Chester's screams resemble those of a boy band didn't really seem to bother me; it is still intense.  When my brother had me hear this CD, especially after hearing all the hype these guys were getting, I had high hopes.  To put it lightly, these hopes were crushed like a bug.<br />  The only band that is more insipid and monotonous than these guys is Static-X (but Limp Bizkit is pretty damn close as well).  Linkin Park seems way too happy with their formula of scream and rap, which does make for one good track, but a whole album?  Give me a break!  I felt as though I was hearing the same track over and over and over again.....I'm convinced that they used the same melody for all of their songs (well, probably not, but it sure sounds like it!)  These guys will be gone within 5 years, unless they try something new.  Haven't they heard the expression: &quot;Variety is the spice of life&quot;? Guess not.<br />My Scores:<BR>Lyrics (fairly repetitive in nature; mostly about angst): 10/25<BR>Engery (not bad for a band that relies so much on formula) 20/25<BR>Musicianship (so they got the basic 2-note structure.....I guess that's all it takes in this world, but that doesn't fly with me) 5/25<BR>Originality (they aren't a complete rip-off of other bands, but they are still very bland) 5/25<BR>Total: 40/100 = 2 stars
B00005JLYW|4.0|The &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; films are much like the opera. You either love it or hate it. I personally like 'em (this film was much better than &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. That movie was pure geekboy trash (yes, I got all the metaphysical monkey crap &amp; I still hated it)).<br />  In &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, the Angels are hired by the Justice Department to retrieve a set of titanium rings that have secured files (once hooked up and downloaded onto a computer) of all the applicants of the witness protection program. If fallen into the wrong hands, these files can be bought and sold at a mighty high price.<br />  The film itself, just like the original, doesn't take itself seriously (come on people, its based on a jiggly 70's T.V. show for God's sake!). The Angels do have there own personal problems, among the best of them is, Dylan worrying if the Angels might be splitting up (Dylan has a vision of the future Angels, among them, her being teamed up with the Olsen twins!). The soundtrack is great including songs from Rob Zombie, Loverboy, The Beach Boys, and Pink.<br />  The action is, sadly, what bogs the movie down. It's great to have a cool action sequence in a film like this, but, when the film relies way, way too much on &quot;Matrix&quot; style fighting and &quot;Bullit&quot; Time slow-motion, you can't help, but, role your eyes and feel there should be something original in its place. The action is also way too cartoonish. I'm not a big fan of motorcross but even I know a cyclist can't do a handstand, pull out a gun, fire off three shots, turn back around, and land perfectly on the ground! If there is a third film, McG should calm the action down quite a bit(how about just a plain old shoot out or bar fight w/ no slow-motion?) and have a  good solid plotline (how about something along the lines: The Angels have to catch a killer who is slowly wiping out former Angel members). Overall, the movie is worth the rent.
B00005B36H|5.0|To the music fan who said that tool's music is not backed lyrically: you obviously have no idea what you're talking about!  You must think that bands like Three Days Grace and Trapt are geniuses, cause you certainly cannot comprehed what Keenan is saying here, can you?  First of all, you bash the song Lateralis over one stupid line. What does one random line say about a particular song and its faults?  Nothing!  If you looked more closely (well, in your case, you're probably too dumb) you might see that Keenan is discussing the progressive loss of innocence, and, if you put that line in its actual context (which you are obviously too dumb to do), you can also see that the over-anaylization of things he observes as he grows up is a struggle that wears away at his mind, and he must keep himself motivated on his journey through life.  I know what I've said must fly waaay over your head, so let me explain.  He's basically saying that life's struggles can cause us to go insane sometimes, and it's these experiences of frustration that move a person from innocence to experience.  I'd say that's much more interesting than your typical theme about hating life, but then again, people like you are too idiotic to really comprehend such issues.  It's really a shame.  I don't have the patience or time to explain the whole album to you (not that you'd get anything out of me doing so, anyway).  So, next time you want to try to act smart, make sure you know what the hell you're digging yourself into!  Don't mess with what you don't understand!<br />   Also, I have some comments for the music fan who was dumb enough to label tool as mainstream.....are you so handicapped in the hearing department that you cannot hear the difference between something like Smile Empty Soul (mainstream) and Tool (not mainstream)?  You must be, because Tool also sounds nothing like Korn, Disturbed, nor Nirvana.  And as for your closing comment......how dumb are you?  No really, am I seeing that line in your review?  The mere mentioning of Justin Timberlake in a Tool review shows that you have no knowledge of music whatsoever, and you probably listen to mindless screaming music.  Tool might not do everything perfectly, but they are by no means a wimpy band.  I'm sorry that Keenan doesn't scream as often as you'd like, and that there's actual melody in the songs.  I'll notify Tool and tell them to make these changes for next time!  Please people, make sure you aren't a complete dumbass before you post your reviews......or go review something at your level!!

B00005V3Z4|4.0|\\"Donnie Darko\\" is already one of the certifiable cult classics of the 2000s, joining perhaps \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" and \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" who already achieve such status in still a young decade. What sets this film apart from the others, however, is its sheer unclassifiable ness: family drama, horror, science fiction and humor are all mixed in this cinematic stew where \\"Pretty in Pink\\"-meets-\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\"-meets-\\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" The outcome is a highly original film that dives into fundamental questions of life itself, all of which makes great entertainment.<br />Set in the tightly-clinched sphincter of late-1980s Reagan America, we meet East Coast Catholic high schooler Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teen with emotional problems that worry his concerned and supportive family. Donnie's world isn't in good shape either: Dukakis is losing badly to George Bush; his fellow high schoolers and friends are brash and racist; his education filled with meaningless fear-and-love emotional studies. The neatly trimmed lawns, big homes and fine green trees of his hometown of Middlesex, Virginia disguise the brewing trouble that is lurking all around. <br />Donnie unexpectedly begins to sleep walk at night, leaving his house to wake up in the morning on hillside roads and golf courses. During one such walk, a disjointed voice lures him out of the house and onto a golf course, where Donnie discovers a guy in a demonic bunny suit named Frank telling him that the world will end in twenty-eight days. <br />This sparks a chain of events that not only puzzle Donnie, but virtually everyone around him, calumniating in a hallucinatory finale where the audience is asked to question what it means to be alive and ultimately what it means to be alone in a complicated and sometimes frightening universe.  <br />With a strong cast that includes Patrick Swayze as an ultra-conservative emotional speaker, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore as Donnie's progressive English and science teachers, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's real-life sister) as Donnie's `80s-brat sister, and the always great Mary McDonnell as Donnie's confused but loving mother, \\"Donnie Darko\\" has a great depth of actors which brings these colorful characters to life. The also fabulous soundtrack includes a slew of `80s favorites, like Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, the Church, and Joy Division. Its most talked about song, \\"Mad World\\" an excellent remake of the Tears for Fears classic by Gary Jules, is absolutely haunting when played near the film`s conclusion. Attesting to its power, it went to number one in the UK in December 2003, nearly two years after being released.<br />In all, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is a great movie to watch on Friday or Saturday night with all the lights turned off, and possibly a cup of coffee once it's ended to talk about it. Like a good wine, \\"Donnie Darko\\" has become more popular since its subdued release in 2001, and with time, has only gotten better.

B00005OWEG|5.0|A dozen helicopters in assault formation blast the music of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's Ride of the Valkyries. The music speakers are aimed below into the dense jungle, and the alert Vietcong that hear the terrifying music know it is their worst nightmare. It is the Air Calvary preparing for war as they drill ahead toward the beach of a small town, which has stood peacefully untouched but will be swarming with Vietcong. Rocket and machine gun fire barrage the defenses of the Vietcong as they too return their fire of rocket propelled grenades and antiaircraft ammunition. Black Hawk helicopters release screeching missiles that explode into huge balls of fire, engulfing entire buildings. American soldiers are dropped off on the beach, scurrying ahead into the unknown, shooting rounds from their M16s and M60s. The chaos grows as a Black Hawk tail rudder blows out and spirals into the jungle and as a helicopter, preparing to evacuate injured soldiers, is blown up by the concealed grenade thrown by a young Vietnamese girl. Now every Vietnamese person is the enemy, and families are being shot down. The commanding officer of the Air Calvary orders an air strike across the entire beach tree line after securely repositioning his men. Three fighter jets respond to the message and unload tons after tons of napalm. The jungle erupts into a vast cloud of orange-yellow flames; anything that stood in the path of the napalm was now reduced to smoldering ashes. The ironic purpose of the battle was so that the commanding officer and his buddies could surf the beach, and now the strong blast of the napalm has ruined the waves.<BR>Yes, this is a scene from Francis Ford Coppola's epic film, Apocalypse Now. A movie based on the book \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" by Joseph Conrad, which centers around Marlow, a sailor, and his journey up the Congo River to meet Kurtz, reputed to be an idealistic man of great abilities. As he enters deeper into the Congo, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has become an insane tyrannical leader over the locals that work for his trading company, and Marlow must kill Kurtz before he does any more damage. In Coppola's movie, Martin Sheen plays the role of Marlow as Captain Willard, an American soldier and secret agent in Vietnam, and Marlon Brando plays the role of Kurtz as Corporal Kurtz, a highly accomplished American soldier, who believes he can fight the war alone with a few well trained soldiers. The movie follows Captain Willard along his mission to assassinate Kurtz, and during all the events that take place, Coppola captures the essence of war itself; and, in a manner as brutally straightforward as possible, he reveals the horrible truth of the Vietnam War.<BR>Captain Willard travels in a patrol boat with four other soldiers: Chief, the navigator and commander of the boat, Clean, a seventeen year old rock and roller, Chef, a middle-aged saucier from the south, and Lance, a Californian pro surfer. Each character represents the kinds of soldiers found in Vietnam. Chief is the respectable soldier, trying to keep his crew safe and alert at all times. Clean is the confused soldier; he is ready to fight, but spends most of his time fooling around and being bored. Lance is the pacifist, constantly getting high and tripping on acid until nothing matters anymore. Chef is the uptight soldier, who fears death because he is homesick and thinks he can survive the war and return one day. The crew has orders to escort Willard as far up the river as he wishes and along the way they fight off Vietcong and Kurtz's army of savages.<BR>Coppola's main focus in the movie is the corruption of the war, and therefore, his movie is very antiwar. Soldiers are depicted as hopelessly bored, incredibly fearful, or horribly vicious. They are seen raping playboy girls, killing innocent people, smoking marijuana, and dropping acid. In the Redux or the unedited version of Apocalypse Now, Coppola even adds a twenty minute scene of a discussion Willard haswith a French family, who complain about the Americans and the insignificance of the war they are fighting. Once Willard enters Cambodia and into the hellish world that Kurtz has created, the chaotic corruption in the movie has reached a climax. He finds shrines filled with skulls propped up by spears and decapitated and mangled bodies lying all across the banks of the river. He meets Kurtz's savage army and finally Kurtz himself. The man appears intelligent and sophisticated as he talks to Willard about war and the soldier needed to fight in such a war, but the methods he practices are \\"unsound\\" according to head quarters and Willard kills Kurtz. The movie ends on an ironical note because it seems as though nothing has been resolved. Corporal Kurtz may have been the only sane soldier in such an obscure war, and Lance, who is intoxicated during the entire episode, is the only one to survive with Willard.    <BR> Apocalypse Now was introduced into movie theatres in 1979, but was considered so controversial that it only appeared in Europe for a few years before finally being accepted in America after a considerable amount of editing. Americans still saw a very gruesome portrayal of the Vietnam War and found it either unbearably unpatriotic or properly executed. In my eyes, Apocalypse is one the most amazing visual experiences in the world not only because of its groundbreaking perception of the Vietnam War but also because of its incredible cinematography that brings the movie to life. I have watched the movie six times, and every time I stare in awe at the perfection of the filming and directing. Apocalypse Now is a movie that everyone must watch at least once in their lifetime to fully appreciate Francis Ford Coppola's work.

I admit I used to hate Britney for about 2 years then I started loving her again (in a fan way!). I have all 4 of her CDs and I would say that this one and Baby One more time are the best out of them all! I reccomend you buy this CD today if you don't already have it! Only two words I have to say are: BUY IT! <br />The best tracks are, 1,2,3,4,6,10,11!<BR>To Britney Spears: You are one of my favorite singers, and you're dancing and singing and hard work, totally rocks! Luv ya Brit!
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|If you've seen either &quot;The Changeling&quot; or &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;, then you know the plot of this thiller.  But that shouldn't deter you from seeing it.  It is an extremely well done horror/thriller concerning Halle Berry as a psychologist who is accused of killing her husband (Charles Dutton, believe it or not). She doesn't remember the murder. Is she crazy, a cold blooded killer, or is someone framing her??? <BR>Berry is superb in this difficult role, as is the rest of the cast. Very dark, moody direction and some excellent effects make this Dark Castle production their best. Dark Castle specializes in William Castle remakes and horror. Their next is a remake of &quot;House of Wax&quot;. Silver and Zemekis hold the golden age of horror near and dear, so we'll be seeing more tribute films as the years go by.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Just when I rhought they couldn't get better, they did... I can say that I've never been wowed by any other band as much as I've been wowed by them APC. This album is pretty melow with one song that has a harder beat and feeling but still realy awsome! I just like the way the album flows... it seems like all the songs tie into one another! It really isn't describable... you'd have to buy it to feel the depth of this album, you really can't take my words for it... just go before it's too late!
1881273156|5.0|I am a college student who read this book because my Africana Studies teacher mentioned it in class. This book was very helpful in other ways of self expression. It shows that with a positive attitude and patience, things will change and can get better. This book reminded me of &quot;The Seat of the Soul&quot; in the way that it was formatted and the way it read. Anyone who is looking to improve themself as well as gain insight to those around them should read this book. Not to mention that it was a easy read.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|ok first things first, don't pay attention to the name, these guys are not in anyway death metal. knowing that this is Josh Homme (frontmant from Qotsa and quitarist from rock gods Kyuss )side project. i was immediatly intriqued with the concept of a &quot;death metal &quot; project. however things couldn't have worked out better(not being a big fan of death metal and all) this is plain out Rock and Roll , with a twist,  literally i mean this album makes you want to dance , all songs are great , infact the only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is because the production doesn't seem to be as good as it could have been. but givin the fact that this album was probably done in one take, i 'll give it all the credit in the world. (you can hear them discussing timmings and transitions at  the beginning of certain songs, but don't worry it isn't corny. the lead singer in this group has a really funky groove going on  which im sure will get them in the main stream, and as always like most josh homme productions Drugs seem to play a huge role in inspiration, which only makes it that much more intresting.<BR>pick this album up it is hands down one of the better rock records realeased in years.<BR>Atta boy JOSH!

B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie is so cool!  When I was 10, my friend had a sleepover and her dad rented this movie for everyone to watch.  My mom wouldn't let me go because she thought the movie looked &quot;evil.&quot;  So, when I saw it now, as an adult, I had to buy it!  I love it....and, actually, my mom does, too.  I think she was just freaked out by David Bowie's spiky hair.
B000089CJI|5.0|Listen to this album...not only is it incredible, but its also inspiring.  The Postal Service has discovered how to put depth back into the shallow pop melodies of today's oversaturated corporate market by reinventing a style of subtle techno beats laced with enchanting lyrics that have a story telling fantasy to them while still retaining a semi-conscious style of poetic realism, and separation from the listener, keeping us at a comfortable distance, in a bubble with our own fears and desires while exposing themselves--the artists--to the vulnerability that honesty in an art tends to bring; along with the depth and trust developed in the lyrics and melodies that makes a room filled with the vibrations from this CD seem distanced from an exterior world of chaotic misunderstandings and artificiality.  Listen to this album...
0452282152|5.0|Over 650 people have taken time to write a review on this amazing novel, a large majority offering the highest of ratings.  Their reviews are substantial and I recognize my contribution would be repetitious.  The novel was exquisite.<br />On a personal level, I was presented the novel by my daughter.  She informed me she read it  &quot;cover to cover&quot; in one night and offered that I may enjoy it as well.  Within a few days, I noticed her in the backyard examining calla lillies.  Soon, she was requesting a canvas and taking out her stash of paints.  Sketching a replica of the lillies, she spoke of the subtleties of colors and the teachings of Vermeer that were passed on to his maid in the content of the novel.  Searching for ways to covey the finer points of the book without betraying the ending, she was clearly irritated by my comments to not give way the plot.  It was easily resolved with reading the book. <br />I, too, felt as enchanted as many of the 650 readers.  Everything about the book captivated me; the dutch history of the 1600's, what it could have been like for a poor maid to integrate in a  large household of  a prominent artist   and the intricate process of how a painting is conceived and completed.<br /> I was urged to research more intensely Vermeer and his works  which were easily satisfied via the internet.   Vermeer's biography (what little of it available) and the pictures of his paintings truly rounded out the experience of reading the book.<br />For an entertaining novel that  could  be enjoyed  on a long afternoon,  I could recommend none other.  After you finish the book, visit those sites that offer the representations  of the works of Vermeer or, if you are fortunate enough, make sure to see the original pieces in your lifetime.  Thanks to this novel, it has lit the candle of interest and appreciation.
B00006FDCD|2.0|Tim Curry is the best part of this movie. He's a clown that will visit you in your nightmares. But this story is way too dragged out and the &quot;explanation&quot; for the killings is ridiculous. It was a huge letdown after watching this movie for hours.
B00005OLY5|1.0|By far one of the worst big-studio fantasy films ever made, Willow tells the gag-inducing story of the titular dwarf (Warwick Davis) who must protect a baby from the evil Queen Bavmorda, who fears the infant child may bring about the end of her reign according to an ancient prophecy. Willow comes in possession of the child by accident and goes on a quest to return the baby to her people, ignorant to the dangers of such an act. <br />Val Kilmer stars as Madmartigan, a skilled warrior who's saved by Willow (don't ask) and eventually joins his adventure. For obvious demographic purposes, Madmartigan (in)conveniently falls in love with the lovely Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), thanks to the `magic' of the Brownies, little miniature cavemen-looking dudes with French accents. Yep, you read that right.<br />Willow presents a very typical tale for the genre, but still with the potential to deliver loads of fun, and screws it up with cringe-inducing humor, horrible special effects, poor pacing, and dull action sequences. George Lucas decided that he'd embrace all the clichés of the genre (quest to save evil from taking over the land, sword-swinging hero, sword-clashing battles, ugly monsters, etc.), which wouldn't be a problem if director Ron Howard injected the film with any sense of energy, imagination, or even comic timing. But his work is a simple point-and-shoot affair, bland direction that accompanies a silly script accentuated by some painful performances and dialogue.<br />Warwick Davis' performance is borderline awful in its utterly sickening and often unconvining sincerity. He simply doesn't have the acting chops for the lead. Faring only somewhat better is Val Kilmer, who does get in a few funny moments and looks appropriate for the part, but is really nothing more than a bland hunky hero. As his love interest, Joanne Whalley is charmless, resulting in one of the more perfunctory romances I've seen in recent memory. Kevin Pollak also offers support as one of the Brownies. This is easily his most obnoxious and grating performance to date (and one I'm sure he's embarrassed of these days).<br />Even the villains do little to energize the picture. Jean Marsh aspires to little more than playing a typical evil queen, and despite wearing a skull mask, Pat Roach's General Kael is ultimately pretty wimpy for such a `scary-looking' guy. And what's with naming the villains after respected film critics? With Kael and the two-headed Eborsisk, this clearly shows a lack of taste on Lucas' part, who probably didn't take well to Pauline Kael's general dislike for his Star Wars trilogy.<br />Ron Howard's never been much of an action director, so it's no surprise there's no flair or energy to the battle sequences, which are too small in scope and far too tame and bloodless for a sword-and-sorcery adventure. It seems in true Lucas fashion, this one's targeted straight to the kids, like almost everything else he's done (the Indiana Jones trilogy excepted, thanks perhaps to Spielberg).<br />James Horner's giddily cheesy score might have worked as a fun backup to a more enjoyably silly film, but it just adds to the subpar quality here. The special effects are pretty bad, even by 1988 standards, there's tons of obvious blue-screen, and the sets are stock-fantasy standard. You know that movie cliché, where two lovers who haven't seen each other in a long time reunite by running toward each other with arms wide open; yep, Willow actually ends the movie on such a cheesy note, an apt finish for a pretty awful movie.<br />Somehow, Willow is still neither George Lucas nor Ron Howard's worst film to date.

B00005JKCH|2.0|Not too long ago, I was a rather avid fan of the Spider-Man comics, always anxiously awaiting each month to see what new catastrophe our webbed hero would have to face. I stopped keeping track of the stories after the &quot;clone saga&quot; mess, which is simply one of the worst cases of &quot;overblown&quot; I've ever read. Then I heard news about a Spider-Man movie, which quickly became reality. It was an event I was neither looking forward to nor dreading. Unsurprisingly, it's a movie that I felt neither unbridled enthusiasm for nor utter disdain. It's as middling as mediocre gets.<br />High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy amateur photographer who's bitten by a radioactive spider, consquently being endowed with arachnid-like powers. He has super-strength, can jump great distances, and maybe best of all, he's got a spider-sense that warns him of danger. With these new abilities, his first acts are only thinking of himself, generally trying to make as much money as possible with his strength and agility.<br />But when Peter's uncle is killed by a robber, he realizes that &quot;with great power comes great responsiblity.&quot; Haunted by his uncle's death, he goes about as a crimefighter, dressed in a red and blue costume, calling himself Spider-Man. A new, even more powerful foe called the Green Goblin arrives on the NYC scene, causing a lot of destruction in hopes of...well, that's not really clear. Meanwhile, Peter has to balance out his crimefighting with his personal lives, particularly with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), a redhead he's got a crush on.<br />The very core of Spider-Man's biggest problem is its casting. While Willem Dafoe is terrific as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and J.K. Simmons is a wonderful J. Jonah Jameson, almost every major character is miscast. Tobey Maguire is a mixed bag as Peter Parker. When he concentrates on the dilemma of the mixed lives he has to juggle on-screen alone (or with Dafoe), he's very good, but comes across totally flat when he actually interacts with his co-stars, particularly James Franco and Kirsten Dunst.<br />Speaking of Franco and Dunst, how can these two be so charmless and without emotion? Franco does little more than brood, making one wonder why the more chipper Parker would even hang out with such a guy in the first place (Harry Osbourne was different personality-wise in the comics). Kirsten Dunst is the worst bit of comic book-to-film miscasting since George Clooney as Batman. Mary Jane Watson, arguably the most important character in Parker's life, is now little more than a grating redhead who lacks a discernable personality beyond constant superhero doting.<br />For all that's wrong with the portrayal of those major characters, the origin story is really rather well done. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit until Parker suited up as Spider-Man. The character's first CGI appearance is just a total distraction. Perhaps it was unavoidable, but the action scenes look more like cartoons than physical, death-defying showdowns. Unconvincing CGI was probably inevitble, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it.<br />The movie also blows it in regards to the Green Goblin's motives. True, he initially wanted revenge against the board members that voted against him, but what about after that? Maybe the Goblin aspect of Osbourne's personality is power-hungry, but then again, all the Goblin ever does is blow stuff up. Maybe he just likes to see stuff blow up. If so, that's one of the laziest and lousiest villainous motives I've heard to date.<br />Truthfully, not every aspect of the movie's central story or the action is as bad as I make it out to be. (moderate spoiler in this sentence) The dichotomy of the hero and villain is fairly interesting and their final mano-a-mano to the death is rather rousing, even if it ends on an idiotic note (was the Goblin trying to intentionally kill himself in the process of killing Spider-Man?)(he didn't have to get up like he did). But damn, those goofy CGI stuntmen and half-bad acting really put a downer on what should have been an exciting and touching summer blockbuster. <BR>** 1/2 out of *****
0783230710|5.0|Hey Zahnduhl,<br />You're right to point out that we want to see movies in their true &quot;theatrical aspect ratio&quot; so I commend you for that.  Film is an artform - would you crop a Picasso to fit your TV screen?<br />However, I felt it necessary to note that what you have noticed here in this case is most likely an instance of Universal Pictures releasing the un-masked (or Full-Ap) version of the movie as a 1.33:1 release instead of the typically butchered Pan&amp;Scan version that we all so detest.  I can't say for 100% sure on this DVD, but I will say that this was fairly common in the past to help the VHS sales.  I commend them for at least doing this as opposed to cropping, but I can see how it could leave you (and others) thinking that your precious movie was cropped for the WS transfer.<br />Rest assured, however, that most likely you are just getting &quot;more&quot; in this VHS version than was ever released theatrically.  This is possible when the studio decides to release original Full Aperture footage for the VHS release.  Although, you will likely find that Visual Effects shots will still typically be cropped b/c most of the time VFX houses will only work in the final theatrical aspect ratio.<br />Anyway, I hope this clears up any confusion for you, now go buy the DVD.  ;)<br />-anonymous
B00009L1UP|5.0|Out of all the reviews that everyone has written for this album I don't think anyone mentioned that this re-release of this album is remastered in 24-bit.  That may not mean much to most people but anyone that loved this album before will love it even more now.  It sounds alot better than the original cd release.  The differences may seem subtle to most but to me it is night and day and the additional tracks are amazing.<br />I say for someone who likes or loves Queensryche that this is a must have.  If you are someone who isn't sure if they like it or not then maybe start with the original release.  But hey, seeing how it has more tracks, higher fidelity, and costs about the same as the original release, why not go with this release jsut for the simple fact its a better value as well.
B00008OLYN|3.0|\\"Damnation\\" is frustrating, because I keep expecting this obviously very technically skilled band to transcend and create a killer album, and once again they've fallen short. It's a good cd, make no mistake about it, but I just don't get why publications like Kerrang are calling these guys the saviours of heavy music and praising their \\"genius\\" and \\"brilliance.\\"<br />The production on this album is great-- it \\"sounds\\" beautiful. A band like Opeth can only benefit from a higher budget and less \\"raw\\" sound in the music. The songs they write are very musically intricate, and Stephen Wilson's production suits them better. As usual, some of the guitar lines are stunning-- a song like \\"Hope Leaves\\" really shows what this band can do. The overall feel of introspection and quiet desperation on \\"Damnation\\" is one the band accomplishes very well. It's a refreshing change from the crashing and often overblown heavier riffs from their early albums. I suppose it's also something that this album, being very different for the band, isn't boring or a self-indulgent mess like the efforts of other bands that attempt the same thing. (like Glen Danzig's \\"Black Aria\\", which somehow manages to be both)<br />However, it's tough to find many truly memorable songs on \\"Damnation.\\" Some of the songs (like \\"Weakness\\")are so stripped down in tone that they barely register, while others (like \\"In My Time of Need\\") feature musical experiments that don't really work (in that case, annoying and repetitive vocals). Opeth are a refreshing change from the boring conventions of much heavy music, but despite the hype, they still don't own a spot in my regular cd rotation.
B0000931QA|5.0|Just like the review I wrote on EMPIRE the same goes for this one.  I can't stress what a difference 24 bit makes.  All you really need to tell the difference is know what to listen for.  You probably also need atleast a somewhat decent system.<br />But all in all another great re-release.
B000002HJR|5.0|I don't like to use hyperbole and gushing praise when I describe the bands I like. I want people to trust my opinion, and the opinions of fawning fanboys are some of the least trustworthy out there. All of that in mind, I fully stand by what I said in my review title. This album is truly legendary in the heavy music genre, and Philip Anselmo, Pepper Keenan, Kirk Windstein, Todd Strange, and Jimmy Bower deserve every word of praise they've gotten for it.<br />The guitar work is amazing-- one catchy but crushing riff after another, all the way through. You can almost laugh as you feel the brotherly jamming that must have gone on to create this stuff-- these guys play so well togetehr you can tell they've been friends for years. Jimmy Bower's drums aren't technically remarkable, but accompany the music perfectly. The bass keeps pace, which is fine, the guitars and drums deserve the limelight they have-- this record is about head-bobbing beats and great riffs. Lastly, Phil Anselmo's vocals are superb-- he sings where it's needed, screams or yells on key when it's demanded, and maintains his tradmark powerful presence without forcing a Pantera-style sound on the music. To top it all off, producer and longtime Crowbar member Matt Thomas keeps the sound raw and uncompromising without letting it get too ugly: a perfect job for this album.<br />Perhaps the greatest thing about \\"Nola\\" is how the whole album bleeds with soul and feeling. It's serious without being melodramatic, fun without being careless, crushing without being overbearing-- everything clicks. A fan of heavy music would be very hard-put to find this record disappointing. Ten years after it was made, it still stands tall.
1400034779|5.0|Precious Ramotswe truly is precious, and the book is a quick, funny, quirky and captivating read.  I found myself laughing out loud while reading passages about lawyers and people suffering from constipation.  The Botswana culture, albeit stereotypical,  came alive through the author's brief but colorful depictions of roads travelled, snakes and bugs, witchcraft, foods eaten, and personalities encountered.  <br />The lore of Botswana through the eyes of Precious and the variety of cases she solves in her trusty &quot;little white van,&quot; is quite a fun and relaxing read.  Be sure to share this one with your friends, family and favorite attorney.
0425163407|3.0|This story is a good read, but I'll admit I enjoyed the others better.  Still, if you're a Kay Scarpetta fan, you'll want to include this in your reading of the series.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|C'mon already!!! Mindless psycho-babble, painfully predictable fight scenes, and equally pathetic acting by \\"The One\\".  Don't waste your money.  I felt like yelling out \\"This is crap!\\" 5 minutes into it.
0312263120|3.0|This story is interesting and fun to read, especially to figure out the puzzle at the end, it just isn't Dan Brown at his best.  Don't judge nor end enjoying this authors work with this book.  Do read his other works, especially Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code.  They are 5 star pieces of work.
6305265666|5.0|I didn't bother seeing this movie when it first came out. I had the feeling it would be a tad too silly for me. A friend of mine brought it for me to watch one day with some other movies. I kept this one for last (dreading to watch it). Boy, I was wrong. I loved this movie. The retelling of Cinderella was great and I absolutely loved Drew Barrymore's character and the way she was portrayed.
0743490304|4.0|While this is not my favorite work by Dan Brown it is enjoyable.  Creditable research yielded and good mystery that will keep you up reading late at night.  A bit predictable at times, this book is still worth the time to read for Dan Brown fans.  The characters are very interesting as is the technology contained in this story.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|for the last two years of the Beatles, they were a quintet.  John, Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko.  Give her respect.  I'd love to see Paul, Ringo and Yoko jamming together, imagine them singing Beatle songs with Yoko in John's place?  doesn't that sound awesome?
0385504209|5.0|This is a great work of fiction and was delightful to read.  It can open your thoughts to another aspect of how to look at the subject matter of the story.  The settings are richly presented, the writing flows, and the story moves at a good pace.  Do not select this book and expect historical facts in every aspect.  It is a work of fiction based on some historical fact.  Dan Brown is an excellent writer and presents his view in a spellbinding story.  This book is thoroughly enjoyable and shouldn't be missed.
0930289234|5.0|Did anybody notice that the lion's share of really bad reviews were written after George Bush began his 'war on terror'?<br />I think this book is not dated at all, despite its a pre-2000 cold-war setting.<br />There are the parallels of 9/11 with the ending of a graphic novel that has been written many years before.<br />But even more important, one of its chapters (rorschach's story) ends with a quote:<br />&quot;Battle not with monsters, lest you become a monster.<br /> And as you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back to you!&quot;<br />(The chapter before this quote makes you really understand its meaning.)<br />Comparing this quote  with the 'arguments' used by the Neocons to justify the war in Iraq one might understand why some people are so desparate to bring down the user rating of this groundbreaking graphic novel. It's an election year, folks!
0440217563|5.0|Pick up the first two books in this series, Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber, and then read this third installment for  unparalleled reading enjoyment.  There stories are all well written and leave you satisfied for time invested in reading them as well as wanting the story to continue (which it does in Drum of Autumn.)  Highly recommended reading.
B000068PQ0|5.0|On a whim, I bought this CD at Borders last summer.  The title was clever, the art was attractive and the tunes sounded nice enough.<br />At first, it bothered me a little bit.  &quot;Yoshimi&quot; seemed a little bit passive.  I was worried that I had wasted $16 on another CD that I hadn't researched enough.  However, it quickly grew into one of my favorite CDs of 2003.  Yoshimi is good from beginning to end.<br />You'll immediately enjoy tracks like &quot;Fight Test&quot; and &quot;Do You Realize??&quot;.  And, after repeated listening, tracks like &quot;One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21&quot; or &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&quot; will reveal themselves to you.<br />It has a nice mix of electronica and pleasant guitars/singing with a driving drum beat.  It is excellent car-music.  Even if you only listen to it as background music, you'll notice the songs drifting into your conscious thought.  The lyrics are clever and the songs are infectious.<br />Give it a try if you have any stomach for the unusual at all .  It will reward you.
B00000DGUG|3.0|Morissette sophomore album is a total different response from &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, this &quot;Infatuation Junkie&quot;, is a more light up and positive way of seen life.  This album is really full of emotions but deliver to us in a more less anger way.  Something that would harm in the way a lot of the fan base that miss Alanis had created.  The first single &quot;Thank U&quot; was an instant radio friendly hit that portrait a nude soul that expressed her gratitude to everything she has receive in life, a theme that Alanis was distant from, the repetitive thankuness makes this song soon to anoyed the listener after a few spins, but still a very revealing song, the second single that saw the light of radio was &quot;Unsent&quot; a biography in progress that describes the songstress love relationship, a monotony deliver in music, the story is great but the sound average, the third &quot;Joining You&quot; is a more Alanis-Used-To-Be-A-Like song, with a rock vibe, and a great chorus line, something missing in the previous songs.  The fourth single &quot;So Pure&quot; is a danceable track, that believe or not, works, for a rock junkie like Alanis, it's a great tune, that deserve better in the radio airplay, a love song above all.  The last single &quot;That I should Be Good&quot; it's one of the best tracks of the album, intimate, atmospheric, great interpretation a delivery by Miss Ironic.  This album is not as good as Jagged, but is different and eclectic, although many of the superb tracks got lost in the monotony of some of the 17 tracks, that for my taste was just too much chorusless Alanis(I would rather had 6 tracks remove and include Uninvited in it)...One of the tracks that never were release as singles and were highlights here are &quot;Front Row&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Baba&quot;.
B000002P2V|1.0|Nightmare for fans of the original LP. As has been stated in other reviews, about four or five songs have subtle but extremely disappointing re-mixes. Many of the little things that I had come to know by heart are suddenly gone and replaced.  <br />SACRILEGE! Why do record companies desecrate legendary pieces of work? For shame! <br />By the way - I rate the original &quot;Who Are You&quot; very highly! It's in my top 20 of all-time favorite rock albums.
B0000636UN|4.0|Totally California feelin' to this Record, a great album to own, The leading single gave the prelude of a great produced album, &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; it's a feelin' good song, &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is artist-quote song, that reflect the Hollywood-influenced album, a total rock song, &quot;Cmon, Cmon&quot; with miss Nicks is a great smooth folk sounding song, &quot;Diamond Road&quot; it's the best track of the album, great feelin' to this, so soulful, this album it's a feel good LP, that sounds, like Crow it's not tryin' hard to sing, it's like her just simple and good, a great soulfree and no worries, different to her other superb and introspective aself title album.
B00013F38K|5.0|I jumped into a time capsule and played the first disk and i was shocked how the integrity of this show still stands the test of time. Besides the obvious fight scenes, this show offers so much more than just it's title. The mood of the show was nicely captured on DVD and the xtra's are really great too. I would recommend this DVD to young and old, it surely recapured my love for this show once again, please don't wait too long before the next season to release.
0060987464|5.0|A VERY good read for anyone who can handle a little sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. This book brings you through a lot of weird happenings, and is written very well. It's a book for the mature of audiences, though.
B00000K19E|5.0|THIS FILM IS THE BIRTH OF ALL COMPUTER GENERATED GRAPHICS. NO ONE COULD EVER DISAGREE. WHEN THIS FILM FIRST CAME OUT I DONT THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WAS READY FOR WHAT IT SHOULD US. MANY PEOPLE TO THIS DAY STILL DONT UNDERSTAND THIS FILM AND SEEK THE ANSWER IN THE REST OF THE MOVIES. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS WOULD BE MY SECOND FAVOURITE MOVIE OUT OF THE TRILOGY. BAD.
061323717X|2.0|The book, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon takes place mainly in the Appalachian mountains. Its about a 9 year old girl who wanderrs off a trail while on a hiking trip with her mother and brother. It takes you on the journey that she had while she was lost in the woods. She had to live without things we couldnt imagine being without. Starvation, creatures in the woods, and loneliness are just to name a few. The reason that Tom Gordon, a professional baseball player for the Red Sox, is on the title is because he was basically her companion throughout her journey. although he was just a hallucination, he is what kept her going. i thought this book was alright. it just never really got me totally interested in the story. A lot of the beginning was a little boring because it just talked about her walking around in the woods. what was interesting to me is that a 9 year old girl could know so much about the forest and be able to survive as long as she did. i would only reccomend this book to someone who has time on their hands to read a book.

B00005JLTN|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVOURITE OUT OF THE WHOLE TRILOGY. FROM START TO END THERE IS ACTION AFTER ACTION. THIS FILM KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES AND OF YOUR SEATS. I COULD WATCH THIS FILM OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BAD.
B00005JMCN|4.0|My husband and I rented this movie last week.  In general we loved it.<br />To be honest, no one told us it was going to be funny as well as entertaining and historically accurate.<br />The film angles were wonderful - with the exception of the conversations which took place on horseback.  These looked contrived on plastic horses with actors heaving on top of the machines.<br />I was unaware of the true life of a jockey in this time.  The anger, the weight control, and the dedication to the point of horrific actions and demands on body and soul.<br />The film was beautifully edited, with important segments left to the imagination - which is so often overdone in current movies.<br />See it - you'll like it - in general.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|By far the worst out of the trilogy. The first one was a classic, the second was pushing it, and the third, well it was just horrible. Complements to the CGI guys, but if there was ever a movie that proved that special effects don't make a movie, this is it.<br />We spend the first movie really caring about the main characters, Neo's journey, Morpheous' faith, Smith's joyous evil...then for the grand finale, we're forced into a position where we no longer know who these people are, and could care less what happens to them. It felt like Neo/Reves had a handful of lines, and poor Morpheous--once the grand character in Matrix I, is relegated to a a couple scenes and a few lines. <br />This isn't a movie, it's a show piece for your HDTV set. Regardless, I have successfully convinced myself that Reloaded and Revolutions never existed, there was never a Matrix trilogy. Just the first one.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|This is one of those movies that could have been great.  I mean really, really, really, cult movie to the max. great...  Only they missed.<br />The story line is wonderful, but for the first thirty min. you are left wondering what is going on.  You have no idea past history until over half way through the movie.  I have seen this tactic done before in other flicks, and this one just didnt get it right.  I was left wondering for far to long who was who and what was what.<br />Although the concepts between the two waring factions in the film were wonderfully contrived, the fight scenes - scenes important to all battle movies, were horrible!  I kid you not, my husband and I could do better play acting than this when drunk.<br />So what do I recommend?  See it if you are bored.  If for no other reason than the laughs at the &quot;sliced head&quot; scene.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is probably my favorite Beatles album! It's the first Beatles CD I ever really gave a listen I then quickly asked myself why I hadn't checked it out before. I especially like &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;, &quot;Across The Universe&quot; and &quot;The Two Of Us&quot;. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
B0000025DD|3.0|A solo album from David Gilmour should be the perfect add on to anyone's album collection right? Well, judging by many of the songs on this self titled album the answer to that question may be a resounding hell no!. Dissapointing i know, especially considering Gilmour's incredible contributions to Pink Floyd: it was his visceral guitar tone and blistering riffs, not to mention his highly orgasmic solos that brought commercial interest to the bands eclectic sound. Unfortunately on David Gilmour most of the songs suffer from an utter lack of melody, &quot;Theres no way out of Here&quot; has a plethora of riffs but no personality, the same goes from &quot;Cry from the Street&quot;, &quot;So far away&quot;, and &quot;No Way&quot;. Stick to the instrumentals, &quot;Mihalis&quot; brims with laser beams of pure tone and &quot;Raise my Rent&quot; is brooding and wonderful, another classic David Gilmour solo that that brims with urgency, intensity and an incredibly clear sense of the real building blocks of crafting a musical release.
0452284392|4.0|Written by a leading researcher in the field, Linked offers ordinary people a glimpse into the fascinating and complex world of networks. The book covers everything from social networks, to economic networks, to chemical networks, to the World Wide Web, and exposes some of the underlying principles responsible for network structure.<br />Linked explains the importance and prevalence hubs in networks, it highlights the strengths and vulnerabilities of different types of networks and offers insights into such interesting phenomena as the small world effect (best illustrated by the six degrees to Kevin Bacon game).<br />The book does have its weak spots, and it seems to slow down a bit after about 150 pages. However, the book is divided into very short chapters and is filled with many interesting anecdotes - all this means that even the occasional weak chapter moves along nicely.<br />All in all, a great and easy to read book for fans of popular science, but be aware that the underlying topic is complex and the occasional equation does find its way into the book. I skipped over most of these equations and found that my understanding of the concepts and my enjoyment of the book were not diminished. I highly recommend this book.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I love Pink and everything she has done. This is her third album and every single CD is different. The first CD was more of a hip-hop album, while the second album was more of a dance CD, and this one took the direction of a punk rock sound. I own every CD and think that she is an amzing musician and that her sound is so unique. I recommend this CD to everyone that enjoys good musicianship and talented work.
1577311523|3.0|The Power of Now gives you continuous stream of of brief mini chapters within each larger category.  Thus making easier to digest and put into practice the basic yet potentially life changing principles he presents.  It can seem too simplistic at times, but of course when someone has actually experience spiritual union with All That Is, theres not too much the mind can add to that experience.  Halfway between the basics and a intermediate level of writing for those who are more intellectual with their spiritualiy.  If your intellect is not as unnecessarily complex as mine this will be a refreshing and welcome addition to your spiritual library and Path along the Way.<br />Peace Be With You
0553573403|5.0|Fast-paced, richly detailed, and absolutely captivating -- I took to keeping A Game of Thrones in my car whenever I went out, so I could read it at red lights and stopped traffic. The stock fantasy characters and scenarios recycled by so many authors are nowhere to be found here; Martin's characters are as close to real people as you're likely to find in this genre. I've got waist-high stacks of unread books filling my house, but they're all going to have to wait for me to read the other books in this series. I can't praise it enough.
B00013PHGS|5.0|While I've heard of the French duo AIR for quite some time, and have sampled some of their previous work, I bought \\"Talkie Walkie\\" after hearing \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" on a college radio station several weeks ago.<br />The tracks on this CD slowly bind their tentacles into the lobes of your brain and you're forced to obey and listen. Alot. I love every track on this album.<br />What makes AIR truly elegant is they inject soul into electronic music making it human but other-worldly at the same time. It's subtle, seductive, charming and sophisticated wrapped into one. No pretensions here; Dunckel and Godin are simply New World troubadors. This is music you can make love to.<br />\\"Talkie Walkie\\" is absolutely amazing!<br />PS, the bonus DVD is great. A must see and have.
B0000025DV|5.0|I would definately call this album the definitive E.L.O.  Probably contains the most ever popular and/or charting singles released from the band.  Had the 8Track cartridge, STILL have the double UA/Jet LPs!  And since it wasn't so very long running time on the two LPs, nice that it's able to fit on a single CD.  I kept wanting to start playing from &quot;Concerto for a rainy day&quot; (always played that vinyl side most actually..) but couldn't find it on cd, because eventually noticing there's a track/index marker missing here, that should be at end of &quot;stepping out&quot;, so instead you get &quot;stepping out&quot; with a silence pause, and into &quot;standing in the rain&quot;, making one long time total for stepping out, and throwing the number sequence off, the most obvious.  I thought something was up when I advanced to get to &quot;standing in the rain&quot; but got &quot;big wheels&quot; instead.  Was able to fix this and make my own new corrected disc.  Has anyone else noticed this, or was it limited to certain pressing batches?<br />This CD is THE sound of E.L.O., also love the Time disc..  and of course you have to have &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;!
B000063S6Z|4.0|Moby has stated that he has written over 3,000 songs but that they won't be released because most of them aren't that good. I believe it. His good stuff is great - original, sincere, ear-popping music that makes you realize that there are musicians doing creative music. His other stuff is boring - anyone with a synthesizer and a beat machine can grind out this stuff. It is amazing that Moby can't tell the difference because he will include simplistic synth chords shifting slowly and then give these pieces grandiose names as if he thinks they are profound when they are nothing but noodling on the keyboard that anyone can do. This is a good album but be ready to junk a few songs before you upload it to your ipod.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved hearing Amy Lee's voice, but not really thinking I was going to like the CD very much.

630542845X|1.0|haven't seen this movie, and don't intend to.  a movie about a special boy who is misunderstood and has super powers written and directed by a convicted child molester just doesn't appeal to me in the slightest.  It was rated as one of the top ten worst movies of the year it was released, I will rely on that.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Imagine a voice with the timbre of Thom Yorke and the pitch of Freddie Mercury.  That is what Matthew Bellamy pulls off on ABSOLUTION.  This album is a near-perfect blend of space rock, electronica, and orchestration.  Bellamy's vocals soar across the broad spectrum of the human experience, embracing the listener in its achingly perfect sonic vistas.<br />Few albums are able to rock this hard, yet have moments of such melodic beauty.  Easily one of the 10 best albums of the decade so far.  <br />I do, however, feel compelled to warn any prospective listeners that this albums sounds A LOT like Radiohead at times.  If you really dislike post-THE BENDS era Radiohead, this album may not be for you.
0312995423|1.0|If I were Dan Brown, I would covertly buy all copies of Digital Fortress and burn them at my back yard. Digital Fortress is one of the worst techno-thriller books I've ever read. In fact I was so disappointed with this book, that I simply left it in the drawer of my London hotel - maybe someone else would enjoy it (although I highly doubt it). <br />I don't think Dan Brown is a very bad writer. I read Deception Point (a classic airport novel - good pace, interesting twists, passable science) and I'm half way through the Da Vinci Code. But Digital Fortress is completely off the mark. I've managed to guess each and every plot turn, the \\"riddles\\" are simply bad, and even when remembering that the book was published in 1998, the encryption and web technology covered in the book is laughable and lacks the minimum amount of vision you would expect from a techno writer.<br />In short - don't waste your time here.
0767827716|5.0|I thought this movie was a great ride. Not only is it sensational , but it's also a great mix of horror,suspense,action. Trust me,rent it,and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I did.
0385510438|3.0|Although I'm not to the point with Grisham as I am with Patricia Corwell's Kay Scarpetta series, I'm getting a little burned out on uneven writing.  I finished The Last Juror, Grisham's latest novel, and I can't say I liked it as much as I thought I would.  The jacket cover led me to believe this was an action novel focused on revenge.  The novel takes place in the 70's in Mississippi, and a small town is forever altered when a brutal murder and rape takes place.  The killer is the son is some powerful criminal elements in the county, but they are unable to buy off the jury to acquit him of the crime.  The jury convicts him of the murder but can't sentence him to death.  After 10 years, he's released from prison and jurors start getting killed.  Everyone thinks he is guilty due to a threat he made at the trial.  All this action takes place against the backdrop of a young man who moves into the area, takes over the weekly local paper, and turns it into a powerful force of the community during all the changes that occurred in those turbulent times.<br />The novel is split up into three parts.  The first one delivers on what I thought the novel would be.  A crime, intrigue, fear, and tension.  The crime is solved, justice is served, and the criminal is sent to jail.  The second part then heads off in a direction that is completely detached from the main story.  There's no action.  It's just the advancement of the guy's career and life of running the paper.  Even when the third part of the story kicks in, the action of jurors getting killed doesn't kick in until the last 50 pages or so.  The ending twist comes up pretty quickly, and the final end of the novel sort of leaves you sitting there thinking &quot;he ended it like *that*?&quot;<br />If you were reading this for a human interest story covering the changes in the deep South during the 70's, it would work better in my opinion.  But to build this up as a crime thriller and then basically drop that angle until the last few pages left me feeling a little cheated.ast few pages left me feeling a little cheated.
B0001A79JO|3.0|I basically agree with what many others have said. I like their sound, and they certainly have potential, but only half of this cd is good. Tracks 1-6 are great, and from then on it's absolutely terrible. Especially Kool Flattop.<br />It's still an alright cd, though. The Horrorpops have a very unique sound that can appeal to many different types of people.
0321200683|4.0|This a book about enterprise integration solutions, authors claim that they are technology neutral, it is true. In the examples and implementations, they chose 3 most popular messaging frameworks to illustrate the patterns. However, they are pretty biased toward messaging as the &quot;better&quot; solution to enterprise integration strategy. It may have a lot of edges over the other approaches, sometimes it is just easy to use a simple wrapper/facade to do the integration. But I guess authors really intend to push their messaging solutions as the subtitle indicates.<br />Having said that, this is an excellent book of message pattern language, which I believe is the first one introducing the interesting topic. The books touches from the architectural patterns, e.g., messaging bus, pipe and filters, to common design patterns, e.g., publish/subscribe, request/reply, to some patterns that most MOMs provide as integrated solutions, e.g., durable subscriber, message filter, message expiration etc. With all these patterns at hand, a system architect would be able to craft a messaging pattern-oriented enterprise integration architecture by applying the appropriate patterns compositely.<br />The book would be better if authors describe some patterns implementation in more detail. E.g., it would be interesting to see how the message expiration is implemented, does the message contain a timer or the message channel monitor each individual message from start up?  How does the channel interact with the message and check the expiry? Guaranteed delivery is another example. I know most of these implementation details only interest MOM developers, whereas pattern users are only interested in how and when to apply the patterns, but now that the book is about patterns themselves, implementation details would be appreciated. <br />Since all the patterns introduced in the book form a messaging pattern language, knowing each pattern's strength and limitation under the context, scope anddifferent forces, and how it interacts with other patterns to form a bigger(composite) pattern are essential to grasp the pattern language.  A collaboration diagram to show each pattern's transition/migration/composition to each other would be helpful.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've heard in a while<BR>I especially liked the remix of My December.<BR>I'd recommend this CD to anyone who likes either Linkin Park, or Remix CD's...<BR>Luckily I enjoy both
B0000042H4|5.0|No conductor does Wagner like Solti.  I've heard numerous recordings of the Ring and this one tops them all.  Solti brings not only beautiful music, but tension and drama to this recording of the grand epic.  The sound effects are a large part of what makes the drama.  Examples are:<br />  -\\"Das Rheingold\\" - Donner's hammer.<br />  -\\"Die Walkure\\" - Wotan striking the rock.<br />  -\\"Siegfried\\" - forging of the sword.<br />  -\\"Gotterdammerung\\" - crackling of the immolation fire.<br />I first became introduced to the Ring through Levine's rendition.  I was only focused on the music, as I knew nothing of the story, and I must admit that Levine's recordings of this work are musically perfect.  But as I became more familiar with the story, I expanded my listening repertoire to other recordings, seeking to hear more than mere music as I went.  Solti's recording offers everything a Ring fanatic could wish for, including a cast of some of the best singers in operatic history.  Through this superb combination of sound effects, creative tempo variation, brassiness, and singing voices that are as powerful as they are accurate, we sense, as Wagner intended, the world burning down before us--a sense that we do not get while listening to Levine's version.  I highly recommend this recording not only for Wagner fans, but for anybody with an appetite for serious drama.
B00005K3O0|3.0|I don't think this is an terrific film as commonly catalogued. It's a fable about reincarnation as believed in Hindu religion and not so badly conceived although contains a basic failure. Audrey Rose, a little girl eleven years old has disturbing nightmares that worsen progressively. Furthermore his parents are alarmed because a man are watching her. The explanation is this man had years ago a daughter killed in a car accident and he believes Audrey Rose is truly a undue premature reincarnation of her daughter and these is the origin of the strange crises Audrey suffers. Audrey isn't posessed by any devil, simply she expects a better life. Well I find one uses to think things from beyond the grave can't have these defects more own of carnal, human incapacity.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie had so much hype:Scarlett Johanson is being called the actresses' actress,and Bill Murray has that sarcastic humor that makes him a favorite.I was compelled to see what it was all about.It ends up there is no storyline.The vivid colors and artistic,unique film shots were all I could keep focused on.<BR>    Despite the artistic visuals,it seemed they made a mockery of Japanese culture,rather than embracing it,as some others seem to think.The movie makes it seem as though all Japanese people run around being crazy and off the wall like Japanamation characters instead of real people.<BR>    There were some morality issues.Why would it be o.k. for a married man to hang out with a younger woman and lay in her bed and not tell his wife?And if you were going to go into foreign territory wouldn't you want to do something exciting with the woman to make it worthhile?They went to a stripculb once to add some shock value to the movie but the plot was so boring that I could have even fallen asleep through that.They were so dull I wanted to turn off the movie multiple times.<BR>     At the end of the movie I ended up going:&quot;That's it???!!That was the dumbest movie I have ever seen!&quot;<BR>     Bill Murray is a great comic,and I would like to see Scarlet's next movie,but do yourself a favor and just skip this one.Sorry Bill and Scarlet.Better luck next time.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I bought all three CDs, Rumours, Tusk and the White Album (Fleetwood Mac) and I am so glad I did. Althought I have many outtakes and box sets, I am pleased with this one to no end, as well. Lindsey Buckingham was at the top of his game at his profession - although anyone who has listend to Out of the Cradle or Say You Will - knows that he continues to peak. And so does Stevie, by the way. Tusk is a great CD and perhaps the best and the new CD brings it out. I remember popping in my cassette tapes and listening to Tusk while I did homework in college. I miss those days. I took this CD and grabbed the dog, and went walking by the river. It was transcendent. In this case, I was listening to the second CD which had different versions or demos. I looked like a stupid, grinning kid walking down the river listening - but I didn't care. Rumours is also great CD and as well as Fleetwood Mac--Fleetwood MAC.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I should make it clear that I do not play video games though I can't imagine players ever fall asleep in the middle of play.  The same cannot be said for this film.  Actually I wish I had slept through parts because the end result was the same.  Missing a crucial plot point or scene would have explained my confusion during and in the end.  Instead I left scratching my head and tired wondering what happened and why.  <br />Angelina Jolie probably offers up a great personification of Lara Croft and the action is interesting at times.  But if you are not a die hard junky of Play station, this is a waste of time, confusing and surprisingly slow moving.  Don't get sucked in.  <br />md<BR>Michael Duranko<BR>[...]
B00005KFUM|5.0|It must have been 4 years ago when I first heard of Muse, and at that point a lot of people were dismissing them as Radiohead clones. Never having heard Radiohead's music(hey, I was only 13) I pretty unbiased when I heard their single Bliss. It blew me away. The synths and Matt's hyperventilating sweep you right into the 21st century. About a year ago I yearned for some music other than Avril Lavigne and I bought Origin of Symmetry. I don't pretend to be a music expert, but I was deeply impressed. Apart from their futuristic sound, Muse lean heavily on classical music. This is apparent on Space Dementia. I play the piano myself, and I was so happy to see a properly trained pianist. The arpeggio's sound distinctly like Matt's big inspiration, Sergei Rachmaninov. Now this is classical crossover, and not that muzak that the likes of Andrea Bocelli produce.<br />The band gets a lot of criticism for apparently 'sounding like Radiohead'. Well let me tell you something, every time a new British band emerges they are accused of 'sounding like Radiohead'. And anyway, Jonny Greenwood can only play chords on the piano(though he does it very well). In case you're still having doubts, Matthew Bellamy doesn't sound anything like Thom Yorke. Though Yorke has a lovely voice, he doesn't have Matt's vocal range. Now I have never heard Jeff Buckley, so I can't tell. But I do know my classical music,and Bellamy sounds more like an opera singer than anything else. Not á la Freddy Mercury. While Queen's songs were more alike to Rossini or Mozart, Muse are much more akin to the drama of Tchaikovsky or other Russian composers.<br />While the ether is flooded with pop-punk, angsty teens and post Radiohead bands(most of whom are by the way very good), Muse dare to be audacious. Which other band would do a cover of a jazz standard and, on top of that, make it sound like an original? Muse retain the optimism present on the original while adding a menacing edge throughout. A minor point is that though Matt has a beautiful voice, he needs to concentrate more on what he's singing than showing of his voice, like in Microcuts. And Darkshines is rather lacklustre. But the other material makes up for these flaws in abundance. If you love Muse's classical sound, get their latest album Absolution, which focuses more on orchestras and Matt's piano skills.
B0000028M7|4.0|Real genius, i'm not going to write long review because i'm sure you've got better things to do?<br />This album can really speak to you and the levels of frustration and anger being omitted from this band are clear for all to see.

B00005JN02|5.0|I like movies that take me to faraway places, and Wolfgang Becker's \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\" takes us to a place few Americans can even conceive of: East Germany just before and just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For those of us raised in Cold War hysteria, it's instructive to see a portrayal of an average East German family, whose patriotism toward their Communist government was motivated by simple idealism, not by diabolical terrorism. \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\" focuses on Christiane, a teacher and youth counselor in East Berlin who suffers a massive heart attack. The end of Communism and the tearing down of the Wall occur during her eight-month coma, and when she wakes, her doctor warns her son Alex that any severe shock will kill her. Thereafter, Alex moves heaven and earth to ensure Christiane never finds out that the Socialist experiment she adored is no more. This obviously is easier said than done: how does Alex explain to Mom the Coca-Cola banner outside her bedroom window? Or find the old East German food brands and newscasts Mom expects to see? Or hide the fact that his sister Ariane now works at a Burger King? The film's farcical elements are not ignored, but it's to Becker's credit that the farce isn't all there is to \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\" He makes some tart observations about the brutality of the Communist system and the vulgarity of the consumer culture that replaced it. Even more, he emphasizes the drama within the family--particularly when Christiane drops a bombshell secret of her own. More poignant than funny overall, \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\" is at its best when it emphasizes the deep love between mother and son, their common traits and their deep desire to protect each other. Politics may have shaped their lives, but love is all that matters in the end. The German cast--none of whose members was previously familiar to me--is splendid, particularly the actors who play Christiane and Alex: Katrin Sass, an actress of the most refined mature beauty, and Daniel Bruhl, Germany's answer to (and improvement on) Ashton Kutcher. \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\" portrays a political culture alien to most Americans, but the familial bonds it portrays are universal and heartwarming.Germany's answer to (and improvement on) Ashton Kutcher. \\"Good bye, Lenin!\\" portrays a political culture alien to most Americans, but the familial bonds it portrays are universal and heartwarming.
B0000CFW87|5.0|The CD has lived in my player since I bought it several weeks ago, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. It's a beautiful example of what music can be when it's not trivialized into being about sex, violence or anything like that. His voice is glorious, and even though I do regret that translations of the non-English lyrics weren't included, his voice atones for that fault. The two songs Oceano and 'All Improvviso Amore are easy to dance to, set to an awesome backbeat, and the hymn-like tracks Mi Mancherai, My Confession and You Raise Me Up are soothing to the spirit. All in all, it's an awesome CD. <BR>I also must say that I resent the fact that some people have berated him in favor of people like Clay Aiken or Andrea Bocelli. Understand, folks, I'm not trying to disrespect your taste or anything, but he's not a Clay Aiken, nor is he an Andrea Bocelli. He has a unique sound, and I think his music should be evaluated based on that, not the work others have done.
B000069AUI|2.0|Boring, overrated, and pretentious - and that's just the first song.  Coldplay have completely lost the intangible charm that was present on their first album in this misguided, misshapen shot at the big time.  A swing and a very big miss from these soon-to-be one-hit wonders.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|I think there are &quot;greater&quot; GNR songs than this compilation, but it is still one of the best albums released in years, which tells you about the state of the music scene.  It is the songs that people hear on the radio, and like to sing along too.  I would have loved a nice 14 years, or even don't damn me.  But, if this is just getting all of us guns fans ready for the 2nd coming, then its well worth it.  Plus, no one can deny the andrenaline rush you get from the opening chords of Welcome to the jungle.  It makes you want to smash skulls in, and yet on November Rain you just need to be held.  Great band, great music, now how about a great reunion.
0385510438|5.0|Slower paced than his legal thrillers, with writing on the same level as McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and a plot worthy of &quot;King of Torts,&quot; this latest Grisham novel does NOT disappoint.  It's understandable that hard-core Grisham fans want another &quot;The Firm,&quot; but the guy has moved on, combining his &quot;Painted House&quot; style with his other genres to create his best effort yet.  Please give this book a chance!
B00003CXAA|1.0|I'm not sure there has ever been a good &quot;gangster&quot; movie, these films included.  Why?  Because gangster movies are more focused on nothing but glorifying crime and the criminal lifestyle, and that's dangerous.  <br />So while the &quot;Godfather&quot; films sit at or near the top of many a crtic's &quot;favorite movie&quot; lists, I encourage you to think about what you're watching.  <br />As for the movies themselves, they're nothing special.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Spielberg's control is so powerfully present in this film that every shot of the movie feels like a documentary with us as merely observers rather than judges. We see the carnage presented to us without sentimentality. <BR>One of the greatest extended shots in cinema history is present in this movie. The little girl in the red jacket is a marvel of technical achievement and an emotionally wrenching movie device. There's nothing much to say except this film should be watched and discussed for what it is, a document of an intolerable time.
1558216847|1.0|This book is total fiction.   Nothing about the author's<BR>life before he wrote the book or any detail of the journey<BR>has ever been independently confirmed.

0671027387|5.0|By far, DECEPTION POINT is the best thing Dan Brown has done.  With excellent writing reminiscent of Jackson McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and a plot that holds up against DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS &amp; DEMONS, this well-written, well thought-out thriller deserves its place on the bestseller list.  While &quot;Code&quot; and &quot;Angels&quot; were page turners in their own right, &quot;Point&quot; surpasses even those.  Great, great writing and a plot surrounded by interesting scientific facts make this the best read out there today.  And it's always nice to actually learn something in the process!
B000092ZYX|1.0|Corporate rock rears its ugly head once again on this one-hit-wonder's set of 14 all new cookie cutter tracks.  This bland-o-thon goes on much too long, leading the listener to pull out their copy of &quot;Creep&quot; and wonder where Radiohead went so wrong.  A misfire of historic proportions.
B000002LUB|1.0|It's almost unbeliavable that the same line-up that recorded the majestic MOB RULES could come up with this slow paced, tired, stupid turkey. This is one of the worst Black Sabbath albums ever and, if things were gonna stay this away, I'm glad this reunion did not last. If it was not absurd to tell that, I would bet that the reviewers here are being paid to write such compliments about this really bad metal album.<br />There is not one reedeming song here (maybe &quot;TV Crime&quot;). The rest is the worst slow metal ever revorded.
0671015206|4.0|I thought this book said more than &quot;Look! You can be rich!&quot;. To me, it showed that we as individuals can control our destiny, at least in the economic sense. It said that we don't have the right to blame our parents for not being wealthy and we are not victims of our natural economic status. It showed that anyone who is willing to work hard and mind their money can be wealthy. Though I'm not very interested in economic literature, I found this book interesting because it appealed to me as an optomistic look at what someone can do with just a little work ethic and self control. It was imformative but not impossible to understand; it appealed to someone who enjoys quick reads and doesn't want to spend half an hour trying to understand what one sentence is trying to say. A good book for anyone who thinks it can never happen to them and for anyone who wants to be one of &quot;the elite&quot;.
B000003TAR|2.0|Out of the ground, into the sky, Kurt Cobain crashes and burns into the dirt. Look! I'm so clever that I can be a poet just like KurDt D. Kobane!<br />So, Kurt Cobain, a man known more for being a lazyarse heroin fiend than an actual musician, now has a &quot;John Lennon-like mantra&quot;?! And this is coming out just now?! Sorry, but nobody was giving Nirvana or Cobain anything near that kind of praise when this tripe was released eleven years ago. In reality, this wrongful praise is just because Kurt did himself in while his band was THE hot music trend of the year-and-a half. How much more rediculous could these false praises get? If these very-wrong, very-unecessary comparisons continue at this rate, twenty years from now stuffy rock critics will be comparing Cobain to Ghandi, the Dhali Lama, and Mother Theresa combined. Cobain contributed nothing to this world except making milllions dress-alike, act-alike teen followers stupid enough to do what he did. Burn, Kurt Cobain, Burn.
B00008H2LB|1.0|This platter of steaming corporate rock might be ideal for cruising around the high school parking lot, but for those of us who enjoy a little substance with our music, we'll just have to pass this up.  Most of these songs sound like someone hit the &quot;demo&quot; button on the keyboard and sang over it.  I'll stick with my Aaron Carter CDs.  He may be silly, but at least he's fun.
0380002930|5.0|Rarely does a book so unique, so astoundingly original, and so gripping come out that will enlighten the world to the furthest sense.  Richard Adam's Watership Down broke all pre-conceived barriers in the European world and did the same in America months later.<br />The richness of the story compares to that of Catch 22 by Joseph Heller.  The writing compares to something out of Tolstoy or Steinbeck.  Put together, writing and the story that writing tells, if good, will grip a reader and enchant them beyond any reason.  I highly recommend this book.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is huge, and rightfully so.  I have not had much time to &quot;tune in&quot; to many new artists recently, but this band caught my attention from the first time I heard the undeniably catchy first single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;.  I took a chance that the fantastic crunching guitars and powerful vocals would carry out over an entire album and purchased the album before hearing another song.  To say the least, I was not disappointed.<br />First off, I'll mention other singles.  &quot;Going Under&quot;, is a haunting yet rocking way to start the album.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; showcases the band's softer side, and it is carried off very well.  It's hard not to feel the emotion in which Amy Lee sings this beautiful, sad song.<br />For sure, this quality persists throughout the rest of the album.  Songs like &quot;Haunted&quot; and &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; continue the quality hard rock vein, while &quot;Hello&quot; is another slow, emotional gem.  &quot;Whisper&quot; is a mid-tempo anthem of sorts with lots of orchestration and chanting at the end that is a memorable way to close the album.<br />This album has a mood to it that just hasn't been in the mainstream often.  Some will call it a &quot;gothic&quot; sound, but not being anywhere close to that type of lifestyle myself, I don't see it that way.  It is both melodic and modern, haunting and emotional, rocking and heartfelt.  I don't know how else to describe it.  All I do know is that, in a year where I bought a house and had my first kid--which kept me away from being able to pay attention to much new music, this band and album truly caught my attention.  For sure, it is a very powerful listen.
B000002BSG|4.0|Do you like the 70s?  Do you like funk?  Or disco?  Jamiroquai has talented musicians,  creative lyrics, and original compositions.  MY favorite decade of music revisited.  Maybe this album is a little poppier than the bands othere,  but there is a lot of great percussion and catchy tunes.  And for all you &quot;speed garage&quot; fans&quot;Do you know where your coming&quot; from is a great track. Use the force is a funky latin sounding tune and Alright and cosmic girl will have you dancing in your living room.  check it out.
B000000W5H|1.0|It says a lot about what this group had sunk to when the best song on the album, the title song, is a note-for-note rewrite of &quot;Bang a Gong&quot;.  Listen to the two back-to-back if you don't believe me.  As for the rest of the album, the less said, the better.
0385504209|1.0|THIS BOOK WAS SO HORRIBLE I CALLED MY MOM UP AND ASKED HER TO SEE IF IT WAS REAL AND IF IT WAS, THAT I WAS GOING TO HIDE FOREVER. THIS BOOK IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST OVERRATED NOVEL EVER WRITTEN. YOU PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED. I COULD'VE SPENT THE 26 DOLLARS ON SOMETHING MUCH BETTER, LIKE A MAKESHIFT CATTLE PROD. IN FACT, I RETURNED ALL 5,621 COPIES I BOUGHT AND BOUGHT SOME BACK TO BURN THEM. I AM DISGUSTED AT THIS NOVEL. YOU KNOW THAT THING ABOUT IF YOU SET MONKEYS IN A ROOM WITH TYPEWRITERS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, THEY'D WRITE THE ENTIRE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE? WELL, THEY'D WRITE THE DA VINCI CODE IN 3 MINUTES! I MEAN, IT'S SOOO PREDICTABLE! YOU KNOW THAT JESUS ENDS UP IN FRANCE, WHICH BY THE WAY, IS A STUPID ENDING. I SPIT UPON IT! I NEED TO TAKE A BREATHER, I'M GETTING ALL WORKED UP. MAYBE SOME BADMINTON WILL CHEER ME UP. NO!! THE BOOK IS TOO HORRIBLE, EVEN FOR BADMINTON TO CHEER ME UP!! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!Q
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Before I watched this film, a few people told me they &quot;didn't get it.&quot;  However, I felt like the reviews were so good, the screenplay won an Oscar, and Bill Murray was nominated for one, so they had to be missing something.  To my dismay, the film was as unspectacular as I had been told.  I appreciate the film for conveying the feelings of isolation and loneliness one can get when traveling overseas on business.  I've experienced the same thing.  However, the film was far from perfect.  Where was the plot?  Someone needs to acquaint Sophia Coppola with Joseph Campbell.  Maybe I don't appreciate subtlety, but I don't even understand why Bill Murray was nominated for an Academy Award.  I can't believe he was so noticeably shocked when he didn't get the award.  He should have been shocked when he received the nomination!  Some people have called the film &quot;racist.&quot;  I would not go that far, but it certainly made Tokyo seem like one boring place.  I didn't appreciate the lack of respect the film showed for another culture.  In fact, the film smacked of the American hegemony we're constantly criticized for by other countries.  You probably will not heed this warning, because I didn't either, but trust me that this is one film you can skip.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I believe Kanye's College Dropout is a top contender for Album of the Year.  He has done a great job telling his story via the media to sell records and there's an equally relevant connection between his lyrics and most likely his true-to-life experiences.  With all that said, what's up with the somewhat racial &quot;white man&quot; dig on &quot;All Falls Down&quot;... &quot;and the white man gets paid off of all of that...&quot;  Come on Kanye, I thought hip-hop had gotten off that vibe?
B00004C8TF|5.0|This is simply a document of just how high a standard an orchestra can achieve.  Recorded before the disastrous fall out between the Vienna State Opera and Karajan. This is simply the finest recordings of this set of tone poems from Richard Strauss..bar none!  For Horn players this is a special treat and nowhere on earth will you hear such incredible horn work.  <br />Somehow with other orchestras these  pieces can come off either as vulgar or sloppy. Karjan and Vienna worked in these John Culshaw/DECCA productions towards a goal of utmost perfection..AND ACHIEVE IT!  <br />If you compare with Szell, these recording easily bypass  Cleveland's   foray into these repetoire by sounding human and even in places WARM...something the CBC Szell recordings possessed little of.  <br /> Save the waste and get Karajan...these are splendid transfers with excellent playing in all departments.
B00011RPB0|5.0|One reviewer said it well. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a mirror for those who see it. When I see words such as &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;boring&quot; bandied about here they seem to me to reflect directly on the reviewer. When I see others who view it with intelligence, subtlety, passion, and interest, they seem to convey the same properties. All of these are in the movie. And the look at people's foibles (both American and Japanese) is affectionate throughout.<br />The concept of favoritism towards the Coppola name is laughable. There's a reason why her father is concentrating on making wine and not getting the budget for movies. A LOT of people could get together a $4million budget to make a film like this. Whether they'd have the talent is another issue.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I heard of this movie when I saw the Matrix DVD bonus extras.  This was the movie that got them the Matrix.  I felt that is was excellently done with plot twists and mistakes in plans that were excellently directed. Well worth seeing.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I've been listing to various flavors of rock for almost thirty years and I can tell you that this work by Chris Cornell et al. is a masterpiece. Audioslave features superbly produced drums, base, guitar and Cornell's powerful sonic resonance punches out hauntingly beautiful, cogent and enigmatic ballads that describe some of life's unpleasant realities and other songs that question the meaning of life. In summary Audioslave is a master's blend of potent grunge, interesting lyrics and melodic ballads.

You should have directed this film and well,  we sure as HELL would have expected a hard R but who the hell got this guy to direct it?<BR>They could have made this movie big and they messed it up.<BR>When I saw the R rated versian of the film I was like...WHAT THE HELL?...THERE WAS NOTHING R ABOUT THAT.

B000066NW0|1.0|This is the most worst junk ever. You might like this only if you like Good Charlotte. Avril thinks she has the whole punk theme down but what she doesn't realize is that her music to pure bubblegum pop. I mean really, if you listen to Britney's &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; and Hilary's &quot;So-Yesterday&quot; there wouldn't be a difference in the world between ALL of Avril's songs. Her CD is basically very boring, you could probably only listen to a few songs then get bored and switch to another CD! Don't let the media fool you like they did with Good Charlotte. Don't think just because Avril likes to smash expensive guitars that her music is punk because it's not anywhere near! If you're looking for something to bang your head to this would not be the CD! If you're looking for something country/pop like Shania Twain or something...this is the CD for you. Which may I add that Shania Twain was Avril's influence....and she said she was the next Sid Vicious....ha!
157270070X|5.0|The audiocassette of &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; read by Sarah Badel is truly outstanding. I love S&amp;S anyway, but Ms. Badel's reading has enriched my understanding of it enormously, especially Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue. I don't know how often I laughed out loud (at Mrs. Jennings), or exclaimed with worry about poor Elinor and her carrying of everyone else's burdens. No, I'm not crazy, it's just that Jane Austen read aloud by an expert, articulate, dramatic reader does that to a person. I highly recommend this for those who listen to books on tape; you will cherish every word. Ms. Badel and Maureen O'Brien are the best readers I've encountered yet.

IF ANY ONE KNOWS ABOUT WHAT I TALKED ABOUT MAKE A REVIEW ON THIS AND TELL ME!
0486266885|5.0|The reason this bizarre novella has continued to remain so popular and to capture people's imagination is because the idea behind it is ingenious and SO true about human nature: even a good, respectable person like Dr. Jekyll has in him the potential for evil, in this case released in the form of Mr. Hyde, who commits crimes. Even really good people, pushed to an extreme or under the right circumstances, are capable of doing very bad things. That is the moral behind this story of the doctor who concocts and drinks a potion that totally changes his features and unleashes the wicked impulses in him which are otherwise suppressed by his moral conscience.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)<br />The one thing a whole lot of reviews of this movie seemed to have in common was the word \\"slow.\\" I'm not terribly sure why; I didn't find it slow at all (and I get bored easy when I've sat though two slow films in two days, as I had before turning this on).<br />The movie is the story of two American outcasts stuck in Tokyo, a fiftysomething actor (Bill Murray) in town to do an endorsement and the twentysomething wife (Best Actress Oscar nominee Scarlett Johansson) of a fashion photographer (The Gift's Giovanni Ribisi) in town to shoot a rock band. The two of them bond.<br />Which does, okay, sound slow. But Coppola keeps it moving by having the bonding bounce back and forth off the vagaries of Japanese culture and how incredibly different it is from American culture. Underneath all the marveling at the differences that they (and we) do, Coppola is subverting the Hollywood love story. Basically, there are two ways that people fall in love: the real way and the Hollywood way. Coppola gives us the former, and then further undermines the system as the movie progresses. Ultimately, the movie is both frustrating and fulfilling; none of the cliches one expects from a love story are at all in evidence, none of the shortcuts, none of the triggers we associate with what happens between a man and a woman in a Hollywood film.<br />Better than her debut, The Virgin Suicides. A fine film, worthy of the attention it has attracted. ****

B00015HVI8|5.0|My favorite show in the world is Stargate SG-1.  Because I didn't start watching the series till halfway through season 6 i was pretty much out of the loop on most of the stuff, so when I found that they were selling the DVDs of the series I was so excited.  The DVD extras are great for this season, the have commentaries for each episode (they alwyas have the director there and usually the visual effects guy, and sometimes they get some of the actors in there to talk about the epsiodes to!).  They also included &quot;The Director's Series&quot; on some of the discs where they gave the directors hand cameras and had them shoot some behind the scene stuff, that was awesome.<br />And of course as always the episodes are amazing.  If you haven't gotten all of the seasons yet, I recomend that you do.  Every season has had supurb episodes and I will be very sad when the day comes that they (heaven forbid) cancel the show.<br />So in short if you like the show you need these DVDs.  Your really should get them from Amazon.com  they have the BEST prices on the sets that I have seen anywhere.  I have bought the last two seasons from them and had them ship in next day and the amount that I paid on Amazon.com with shipping is less then I was paying in store.
B00006690G|4.0|If you listen closley to Eminem's voice in his songs you will notice that he has an Urban slang.  He has a slang because he grew up in an Urban area.  But I think he does this to attract people from the Urban area's to buy his albums.

The songs get old in about 5 minutes and all the beats start to sound the exact same. And making fun of someone and kicking them when they're already down is really old and tired.
0345363132|5.0|I came across this book purely by accident at local yard sale. Being a fan of Shakespeare's \\"Richard III,\\" I was intrigued by the author's assertion that Richard was not the much-maligned hunchback who killed his nephews. I ended up paying 25 cents for a well-worn book with no cover, and it was the best investment I ever made in a book! The action and story catch you from page one, and the plot moves at a great pace with only a few minor bogged down areas. By the end of the book, I was a convert. I fully believed the author's assertions that Richard's history was maligned by successors who were trying to cement their control in England. I've purchased a new copy since and have passed it on to several friends. BUY BUY BUY!

156898443X|5.0|If you want to be inspired to draw, or to write, or to live more fully, or best of all to do all three simultaneously, (and if you only have 60 minutes to move closer to your goals)- Everyday Matters is a must read. It's real, charming, witty, whimsical, and teaches art and life lessons that can be applied BY ANYONE. For all those who say &quot;but I can't draw&quot; and even more for those who say &quot;but what shall I draw&quot; this has some answers to the first question and many to the second. It's hard for me to say whether Danny is  a better artist, writer, or philosopher. Fortunately we get all three in this slim volume. I can't wait for his next book.

A must see movie for everyone, kids and adults, cos there is something to learn from this movie -  &quot;Never judge anyone b4 actualy knowing them&quot;.. it is our human tendency to judge people b4 actually knowing them inside out.
0385336810|2.0|I have read all three of the shopaholic books, in fact I've re-read them!  I'm a HUGE fan of that series!  I was so looking forward to seeing what the author would do in this book.  But in all honesty, I thought \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" was a total re-tread of the shopaholic books, except the main character is not addicted to shopping.  The whole set-up, the main character's personality, the supporting characters (co-workers, sexy leading man who happens to be a corporate big-wig, room-mate), were so similar to the shopaholic books.  I was really disappointed, and felt this new book was just a watered-down \\"shopaholic\\" story.
6303394000|5.0|First of all, let me just say that this is one of my top ten movies ever!  Fosse was a true genius and this is a great film.  But how many of you know that Richard Dreyfuss was cast in the lead first and then came to Fosse shortly after filming started to say that he didn't feel he was right for the part and dropped out with Fosse's blessing.  Fosse admired him so much as an actor and while I'm sure Dreyfuss' acting would have been great, he was wrong for the part physically and bore no resemblence to Fosse.  Hard to picture anyone other than Scheider in that part now!  Again, a must-see film for everyone!
0393317552|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Jarel Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. No doubt that the topic proposed by this book is fascinating, and the first pages very promising. Maybe because of that, as you go through you may feel some disappointment. <br />For people who, like me, might be not familiarized with History and Anthropology, the book is full of interesting anecdotes and stories. But, since the scope of the book is very broad, and J. Diamond himself is not a historian, it is likely that the book must contain many imprecisions that might irritate to some people familiarized with some of the topics. That should not concern to the reader. The important thing of this book is the methodology (an approach similar to the Natural History, based on ecological and evolutionary concepts) that he emplys to explain the course of the human history during the last 13000 years, and the generalizations that he provides to explain the outcomes of it. No doubt that some of the explanations provided by Diamond to some issues, for example for the flourish of European societies over China, or India, during the last centuries are clear oversimplifications, which are to be improved by other authors. In that sense, I also think that the reader should not worry too much about it, since this book must be regarded as a pioneer work, more than as a finished conclusion.<br />Among the main drawbacks, besides the oversimplifications (and omission of spiny problems), I would point that the book is too long, what seems unnecessary. The author wants to prove that were differences in the geographical features of the different continents what determined the different paces in &quot;development&quot;Eamong them. His idea is rapidly understood, but he repeats it too much. That's why you feel that the book is somehow loosing interest as you read. I also felt that his reasoning was deterministic in excess, not conceding the enough importance to random events (even with the same forces driving the course of the events, and starting from the same point 13000 years ago, our world today is just one of the many possible outcomes).<br />Overall, I think it is a very good book, and I recommend reading it to anybody who wants to spend some time thinking about the past and present of human societies. Even if you disagree with the author opinions, I am sure that it will be interesting for you.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is the first rock video I had seen when I was 9. &quot;Echoes&quot; is amazing, still banging in my head until now. The expression of Rick Wright when sang it still visualized. When I visit Pompeii two years ago, this location was the first I look for.<br />Definitelly not for CONCERT STYLE / VIDEOCLIP fan. If you are, you'd better blow it and find Westlife video. Don't buy it.<BR>It's a story, it needs emotion. It bring you 70 atmosphere perception of clips. If you open mind with this, BUY IT!!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|A few minutes after the movie had ended and as the credits were rolling on the screen, it became apparent to me that this would be one of the most misunderstood and less satisfying movie story endings of all time. Yes, the fight scenes between Smith and Neo are worthy of Dragonball. Yes, the inevitable Bumbling Boy Saves World cliche had to be revisited. And yes, I am sure many other formulaic choices were made. <BR>It does not really matter/<BR>In my view, every event that happens in the movie is justified by the fact that its objective is not that of presenting a staisfying conclusion to the story, but of making this story reach a higher level of importance. Of making it into a myth rather than just another action-adventure piece of entertainment. It seems sad to me that making people happy be SO easy for any filmmaker. If they just saturate the movie with visual effects, deliver a ton of fight sequences from interesting angles and provide a sex xcene or two, most moviegoers are delighted. It would have been SO simple to do that for this film. Instead, the writer-directors did not compromise their vision and ended the story in an elegant fashion, with a complex message reminiscent of the best aspects of Arthurian Mythos (The barge in which Neo is carried off, maybe dead, maybe sleeping, to a realm of twilight, neither physical nor virtual, presumably both, to be available as the Oracle says, when he is needed again) the Norse sagas (Neo loses BOTH eyes, going one better over Wotan-Odin in order to see into the realm of the invisible and acquire the wisdom that only comes from coexisting in both worlds) and Buddhist philosophy, as he proves that there are no pairs of opposites and that divisions reside only in the mind of those beings who place self over all. THat is the meaning behind his resolution of the Smith dilemma, the way Smith is drawn into him so that a new synthesis, resulting of the union of both opposed proposals can be managed. The Machines are compelled into accepting a new order  by his actions, one that is neither of dominance nor of servitude. A new Matrix is restarted in which the Choice that every being in it must face is made clearer and in which cooperating with the machines is more voluntary. THat is the reason behind the dawn of course. The Matrix is a false world and everything is possible in it if one chooses to order that something becomes so. Neo is the Chosen One because he BELIEVES he is the chosen one. He has faith in it. And just like the first  movie is determined by that word, belief, and the second by choice, this third one is determined by the word hope: To trust in something that lies beyond the ken of senses, and act in confident security of its being favourable. This goes hand to hand with faith. THe ultimate human strength and most sublime of weaknesses, just as the Architect points out. All programs, being desirous of getting to be more and more human-like, seek only the basest of human emotions to be their guides. Ambition is seen as the end-all motive of their existence. But in order to defeat them, they must be shown an alternate truth that Neo must learn as the story progresses: THat living or dying is meaningless if it is not done for others instead of for one's self. And it is to me apparent that humans in the movies are shown to learn this at some point or another, making Neo a Chosen One only insofar as he is the one delivering the message that has been learned by these survivours through hardship and death. This makes the story of the Bumbling Boy Hero relevant and meaningful. This tints the scenes of battle at the Docks with a light of importance beyond that of hardware and flesh colliding in terrible conflict (And no one can fault these sequences from any viewpoint, I believe. The mechanisms, systems, combat tactics, etc. employed, make perfect sense. The ONE concession to movie goers is that of the terminal operator who is looking at the machines repairing their giant drillasking  what they are doing. Anyone in his position would know, being as he is accustomed to fighting this enemy. He merely asks it so that audiences can center their attention in that fact. Unrealistic, but... Helpful to some, I suppose).<BR>The Matrix is made into a cycle in this movie. A cycle that begins, suffers revolutions that involve pain and sacrifice, but eventually ends, giving birht to a new dawning world that will continue the journey, having advanced at least one more step in the direction of unity. One can only hope our world were thus ensured of improvement after every mishap.<BR>THis is not a movie that makes sense by itself. It is part of a story and must be seen as such. It is not meant to be liked, it is meant to give a message. It is a honest attempt at communicating ideas that the writer-directors have, which are a compillation of others, none new. It is an effort very similar to that of George Lucas with his Star Wars saga, and of course to that of Tolkien in LOTR. And to that of any author who intends to link the audience with the symbols and ideas that make up our collective unconscious. Nothing more formulaic OR relevant than to accomplish that. <BR>My apologies for the length of this post and my gratitude to the patience of those who finish reading it.
B000022TSY|5.0|This movie, is exceptional. I wish I had more powerful words to describe it, but its quality goes beyond verbal description. This is easily one of the best movies ever made. <BR>In addition to providing a great view into the late 60's counter culture movement(which EVERYONE learn about... don't so readily accept the things being fed to you about the 60's being just a bunch of hippies doing drugs and having sex...it was MUCH more than that), the movie makes you think....about freedom(Jack's piece on true freedom, and why people are afraid of it, is genuis), about hatred, about ignorance , about the way things should be...and many more things. The movie is jam packed with symbolism. it has a very powerful message... and for those that believe the movie is \\"dated\\"... well, its hardly true. This movie is timeless. Everyone should see it, at least once.

It has helped me to understand and learn to deal with the wrongs that i endured, and to learn how to make it right within myself.<br />Also recommended: Nightmares Echo-because I was a child of sexual/child abuse and it spoke to me plainly. Lost Boy-Because I understood what he went through
B00006CXXU|4.0|I think this is a very good Cd but the only thing I hate is that Christina is very arrogant when it comes to her voice.  She feels that no one can sing better than her and she talks about other female artists like she's a legend.  She gave a good performance at the grammys but the night belonged to Beyonce' when she gave that marvelous performance.  Take that Christina!!!!!!
B0000A36J5|5.0|Almost 3/4 of an hour of extended scenes - some brief and subtle, others surprisingly important, was an absolute delight and brought Jackson's masterpiece even closer to Tolkien's. The commentary offers many great insights and is often genuinely amusing.  The bonus disk and book, devoted to the creation of Gollum, is utterly fascinating in its own right. The Gollum statuette is beautifully detailed, satisfyingly heavy and now has pride of place in a display cabinet in my lounge!<br />What else is there to say about the movie itself that hasn't already been stated?  Surely THE most spectacular battle scene ever filmed vies for your attention with the most stunning and convincing non-human creature ever to grace the big screen! Gollum is utterly believable and the alternating pity, tragedy and horror that Tolkien wished us to feel, is conjured forth with astonishing skill by Jackson.  Sumptious, sweeping landscapes and not a duff piece of acting in sight complete this marvellous movie experience.<br />This edition is SO much better than the 2-disk theatrical version, that it is indispensible to the Tolkien fan.

0385504209|5.0|I've read a lot of the reviews about the historical accuracy of this fictional book and think that people are just missing the point.<br />Similar to Michael Crighton's style, this author has done a tremendous job of wrapping an intelligently written fictional story around some factual historical locations,  theories, items, etc...<br />Don't try to anlyze the historical accuracy to death and just enjoy the story.  It is an engrossing tale that once you start you can't put down until it's done.  This book is excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone.
0679879269|5.0|Have you ever wanted adventure and action put together?  Well if you do, you would read the Amber Spyglass.  This book is connected to two other books: The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife.  The Amber Spyglass is the third book of His Dark Materials Series.  (...).<br />I enjoyed reading The Amber Spyglass because it has adventure, action and fantasy in it.  This book has two main characters in it: Lyra and Will.  (...)<br />My favorite part is when Lyra meets her old friend Roger who was ghost, Will went to see his dad (...).<br />I can not relate this book because it has its own story unlike any other story.  It has its own two books with stories about how this got started. I would reccomend this book ages 10 and up.  This is also reccomended to 5th graders and up.  The Amber Spyglass is intense and diffucult.  It has hard vocabulary to pronounce, and this book is long and thick and has over 500 pages.  This book is hard for little ones and is a very good book for people who likes fantasy.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Joe H. did an excellent job of summarizing Gothika, so I will just give my 2 cents worth.  A little predictable at times, but Halle Berry puts on quite a performance.  It's hard to make her not attractive.  Even with no makeup and simple clothes, she remains such a beauty. The movie is dark...it's always raining and lights are constantly going on &amp; off which sets the scary mood.  Turn off all the lights when watching, sit back and be prepared for a twists that you never thought you'd see coming.<br />Not truly a 'horror' flick, but it did scare the bejesus out of me a couple of times.
B00005JL3A|1.0|It is a shame that this movie has nothing to do with the actual game. The zombies are more laughable than they are scary. (...)Also the atmosphere in the video is what the RE Movie should have been about but this movie is simply an average horror movie. <br />I cannot believe that Capcom endorsed these bunch of idiots to create a movie for the best survival horror game ever. (...) Where is the story? Where are the original characters?. Come on even the (realy bad by the way) movie of the house of the dead is closer to its game (also a shame) than this one.  <br />If I could give it negative stars I would give it at least 10 negatives, not for the movie but because it has nothing to do with the games at all so why call it Resident Evil. <br />Don't get me wrong the movie is \\"fine\\", the girls are realy gorgeous and the story not too bad but IT SIMPLY IS NOT THE RESIDENT EVIL STORY AT ALL, NOT FROM ANY OF THE GAMES, NOT FROM A COMBINATION OF THEM, NOT FROM ANYWHERE NEAR.<br />Damn, I am upset with this.
0689829590|4.0|I remember when this book was first published, and my kindergarten teacher brought it into class to read to us during story time. I remember being enchanted by the fold outs and the idea of actually being able to 'play with the moon' like Monica did. It is a sweet story of the love a doting father has for his little girl. I highly recommed this book for any young child, in fact I was recently given this book for my 20th birthday to add to my collection of favorite children's books.
B00005JM0B|4.0|...of course, my expectations were not that it was going to be better or even as good at T2. There was just no way that would happen. So I was expecting it to be as good as Demolition Man or something(which I thought was just ok).<br />Turns out, T3 was way better than Demolition Man! And I personally thought it was as good as the first Terminator movie.<br />We had awesome action sequences(especially the chase with the crane!), witty one-liners(which every Arnold movie MUST have!), and a decent plot that didn't seem as depressing as one would think it would be. Nick Stahl was great as John Conner. He's a better actor than Edward Furlong, although he doesn't look much like what Eddy looks like. Claire Daines was a good new character too. The T-X was the hottest robot I've ever seen, and she was one tough machine! But I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of her, and focused more on the plot of judgement day.<br />[SPOILER]<br />And the twist of the T-800(Arnold) killing John Connor in the future, as well as judgement day actually happening sets us up for a great new kind of new Terminator movie for T4(if it gets made), because it could take place in a post-apocolyptic world with the human surviors battling against the machines. It wouldn't be the classic &quot;good terminator gets sent back in time to protect Connor/bad terminator gets sent back in time to kill Connorz&quot; scenario. It could be taken to a whole other level because of the plot of T3!<br />Good movie, great set up for T4!<br />[END SPOILER]
0385504209|1.0|I must say this book is one of the most poorly written books I've read in quite a while.  I suppose I must say it was entertaining, though not entertaining enough to buy, just borrow from a friend or the library.  If serial novels and suspense thrillers are your thing, you might enjoy it.  I personally could not even keep it.  I bought it and swiftly returned it two days later.  If you want suspense that is enriching too I would recommend Khaled Hosseini's &quot;Kite Runner&quot;.  That is a fantastic book.

B00004XPPE|5.0|Propaganda writes:  &quot;This film is interesting only in the fact that it is an odd relic of anti-Cold War propaganda; a pacifist film touting a suicidal philosophy of disarmament. Its particularly ironic that the smugness of the film's creators is now quite laughable in the hindsight of history. Despite all the dire predictions this film makes, thirty years later the U.S. would ultimately win the Cold War against the Soviet Union... and without a nuclear shot being fired in anger.&quot;      <br />Respectfully,  I disagree.   The film does not tout disarmament.  The theme of the film,  which runs throughout, is that the machines 'are too fast',  the military systems have the great potential to fail, and that our mutual distrust of what we don't understand (our enemies) which lead us to create situations of conflict with each other, which end in needless,  tragic, destruction.  This is a theme that runs throughout the events of history, that is what makes Fail-Safe timeless.

B0000931QA|5.0|Back in 1988 the state of radio was equally bland as today's festering Nu-Metal swampland.  There was &quot;Hair-Metal,&quot; with horrible bands like Cinderella, Warrant, and Great White(shudder).  But in the midst of that rank wave of music, a few beacons of excellence shone through, keeping loyal fans buoyant with great songwriting.  &quot;Operation:Mindcrime&quot; was just such an album.  This is a landmark album in which all subsequent concept albums are measured.  At CircuitCity.com this album is often referred to with reverance as a benchmark to calculate the greatness of other efforts.  Examples include &quot;Declaration of War&quot; by Mayhem, and &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Symphony X; and I should not forget the obvious influence they have on Dream Theater.  This album finds Queensryche at their most ambitious, mixing Progressive Metal with Pink Floyd, and all the while Geoff Tate's amazing voice soars over the complex arrangements.  I tried to get a co-worker into Queensryche, but being from the Grunge generation, he called Geoff Tate's vocals &quot;'80s Vocals.&quot;  So, with that in mind, the casual(younger) buyer should start with their greatest hits collection.  I grew up on Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and Dio, so faux-operatic vocals don't turn me off, but for those who did not come to appreciate such powerful singing through that era, the greatest hits collection is the way to go.  But after that, if you want a remarkable experience listening to a bona-fide Metal masterpiece, this album is that and much, much more.  This album is stunning!
B000059XXZ|5.0|Batman the type of movie that leaves a lasting impact on its viewer,no matter what that viewer's taste may be.The vision of director Tim Burton is breath taking,to say the least.He creates a world,Gotham City in this case,that is like a retro-take on New York meets London,and truly amazes the audience with his vivid imagination.The movie's cast is also greatly assembled,and everyone plays their part well.The only casting complaint I have is with Kim Bassinger,who portrays the love interest of both Batman and the the villian,The Joker.She just isn't very convincing in her role,and is there simply for the fact that all super hero movies must have a love interest,or else the formula falls apart.Anyway,though it is a solidly entertaining movie,it does have a few flaws.First,the story:you really don't know what The Joker's master plan is untill the last half hour of the<br />film.Second,there is a particularly annoying scene,in which Batman targets The Joker with several machine guns and missles (on his batplane)and fires,while The Joker is standing still,arms spread and challenging Batman.Batman completely misses his target!Pathetic and stupid!Third,The Joker destroys the batplane with one bullet from a pistol!That is ridiculous!<br />And,just to make you think:Batman doesn't have any handguns,but why does he have guns on his plane?It makes no sense.Other than those minor issues,the movie is an incredible and memorable experience that leaves you wanting more.
B00004RF9I|5.0|This was the winner of 4 Oscars back in 1976, ultimately losing the Best Picture Oscar to &quot;Rocky.&quot;  But this film garnered every acting nomination across the board, winning three: Best Actress(Faye Dunaway), Best Actor(Peter Finch), Best Supporting Actress(Beatrice Straight).  Other acting nominations included William Holden for Best Actor and Ned Beatty for Best Supporting Actor.  Obviously, the acting here is amazing!  Sidney Lumet's direction is also stellar, with fluid transitions and a professionalism that makes one forget how well-directed this film actually is.  But the star of this film is screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky.  Back in 1971 he won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;The Hospital&quot; and wrote nothing else for the screen until &quot;Network&quot; in 1976 for which he won another Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  His writing for &quot;The Hospital&quot; is excellent, but his writing here is unprecedented.  The writing is razor-sharp and savagely funny, primarily satirizing the television industry in all its lunacy.  My favorite lines from the film are witty plays on poor journalism like the title of my review or &quot;a wanton fiscal affront to be resolutely resisted.&quot;  The next time you watch the news, particularly sporting news, listen for those annoying phrases where the newscaster uses absurd word-play, usually as a segue.  This film actually changed my outlook on all entertainment industries, from television to radio, and showed me how everything is commercialized.  We live in a capitalist society, so it is little wonder why networks are &quot;in the boredom-killing business&quot; to make money.  Keep the viewers sedated with artificial bliss and you can make them believe anything.  That is only one of the intelligent themes that this scathing indictment of the television industry has in store.  The script is incredibly tight, with perfect concoctions of frantic word-play and insightful revelations.  This is the only screenplay that I own in paperback.  I believe the writing is that phenomenal.  New viewers should be warned, however, that watching this film may make you never want to watch television again.  I've seen this film dozens of times and I am now disgusted with the television industry, magazines, newspapers, etc.  For me, this film really was a revelation.  For most, in the least, it should be an intelligent and entertaining satire on a powerful part of American culture. The ideas here may not be as strartling as they were to an audience of 1976, but most of them still hold true to this day.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko must be the greatest movie ever made. It had everything. Solid acting, wonderful visuals, The Evil Dead, and a steady puzzle piece plot that when coming full circle at the end, left you breathless. I've always been a believer in fate and that we have a set path in which we follow that ends at death. And this film totally explained my beliefs. I never considered the fact that if we could see our set path that we could see the future. I also never considered that our paths came from our chests in liquid spears either. That was a little weird at first I must admit. Jake Gylenhaal gave a wonderful performance as Donnie Darko. His actions and his dialogue were absolutely astonishing. Because it was real. Instead of being comic booky like most sci-fi films, this one spoke to you because some things that are said and done are some things that real people do everyday. You always say when watching a movie &quot;Well you know what I would do in that situation.&quot;. This one struck me so hard because I couldn't utter that phrase. Because they did what I would do. We have motivational speakers that come to our school giving out semi good advice every year. And sometimes I just want to get up and make them look foolish so I can stop the bad advice. Donnie did this to Jim Cunningham. That was frickin hillarious too. &quot;You're right I am scared and I am angry but I also think your the f***ing antichrist.&quot; Wow. And the adventurous suspense part of it was a real doozy too. At first I wasn't quite sure what Frank was up to. But then I could see his rash orders fit together to ensure the survival of all people when the time lapse's ending came. Pure genius. You don't have to have a college degree to decipher this one, folks.  I'm a junior in high school and I figured it out the first time. Buy this film. It may not be a huge box office hit but it sure is a hit with me and millions of others looking for answers about fate. Buy it. You'll be glad you did.
0385504209|2.0|At one level The Da Vinci Code is a good read. It moves quickly and engages the reader from the beginning. It's a piece of mind candy that can be digested in an afternoon. In the process, one can pick up a few interesting facts that can be shared over dinner or at a party - the Golden Ratio, the Fibonacci sequence, and a smattering of art history (though Mr. Brown's interpretation of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; shouldn't be considered definitive; don't tell people that Mary Magdalene sits beside Christ in that painting unless you want them to know that you learned all you know about Da Vinci from &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;).<br />At another level, this novel is a disappointment. It doesn't really matter much in this type of book whether the author gets his historical and geographical facts right. The book doesn't pretend to be an academic treatise on theology and history. It's a thriller and a mystery, and what matters is that the characters be convincing and the clues be consistent. In that regard the book fails. When an internationally renowned historian and expert on Da Vinci fails to recognize that a message written by another Da Vinci expert and placed in a box designed by Da Vinci is written as Da Vinci would write it, backward, wondering instead whether it's written in some arcane Semitic script, you can only roll your eyes and call him a dunce. When two highly educated and supposedly brainy characters are stymied (even if only for a couple of pages) by their lack of a numerical bank code, you're left wondering why they've forgotten the sequence of numbers left in the dying message of the man to whose bank box they're trying to gain access, a message they saw only hours before. Is he so besotted by her glorious hair and she by his rugged good looks that they can't remember numbers that were so important to them that very night? Over and over these brilliant dunces miss or forget the obvious, or at least what should be obvious to them.<br />Well before one of these dim-witted geniuses has the meaning of the Holy Grail spelled out for her, the reader has already put the whole thing together. All that's left is to figure out who the master-mind is behind the book's murders. There Mr. Brown cheats. If a murder mystery (and at one level, that's what this book is) provides the reader with clues, it should provide clues that allow the clever reader to solve it before all is revealed at the end. Rigorous logic should lead to only one possible answer. This novel provides clues that lead logically to the wrong answer, and at the very end suddenly provides new information that requires a re-interpretation of the clues that came before. That's rather shabby. The story's denouement also serves to reduce the novel's shaddow of menace and sense of great and important events to a bit of feel-good pop religiosity and a comically pitiful villain. By the time we find the Grail and catch the killer, we wonder what the fuss was all about.<br />I didn't like this book. That isn't to say that I wouldn't recommend it as light reading and entertainment, but I'd feel disappointed if I expected anything more from it. After all the hoopla, I did expect more. Mr. Brown has done some interesting research and written an interesting story, but he hasn't written it very well, and the editorial enthusiasm for his research speaks volumes about the low standards of editorial writers.of these dim-witted geniuses has the meaning of the Holy Grail spelled out for her, the reader has already put the whole thing together. All that's left is to figure out who the master-mind is behind the book's murders. There Mr. Brown cheats. If a murder mystery (and at one level, that's what this book is) provides the reader with clues, it should provide clues that allow the clever reader to solve it before all is revealed at the end. Rigorous logic should lead to only one possible answer. This novel provides clues that lead logically to the wrong answer, and at the very end suddenly provides new information that requires a re-interpretation of the clues that came before. That's rather shabby. The story's denouement also serves to reduce the novel's shaddow of menace and sense of great and important events to a bit of feel-good pop religiosity and a comically pitiful villain. By the time we find the Grail and catch the killer, we wonder what the fuss was all about.<br />I didn't like this book.

1559409002|5.0|Even being a fan of horror films, I never knew about this great film until the mid-90's.  The Sci-Fi Channel was having nightly film festivals in October leading up to Halloween and when I saw the promo for Carnival of Souls, it gave me chills.  The next night I watched (and taped) it, and have viewed it many, many times since.<br />Nothing conveys terror like atmosphere and things barely seen.  Director Herk Harvey, whose previous film experience was almost entirely in industrial films, captured these important aspects perfectly.  In the supplemental materials on the Criterion DVD, he explains how the sight of the old Salt Lake bath house became the base for this film.  When you see the old bath house, it is at a distance at first, in the evening, draped in shadows.  You wonder \\"What is in there?  Is it empty?  Or could something else be there that shouldn't be?\\"<br />In the film, Mary Henry (played by Candace Hilligoss) is the sole survivor of an auto accident.  Afterwards she leaves Kansas to take a job in Salt Lake City, Utah.  As she nears Salt Lake, she sees, in the distance, the shadowy hulk of an old pavilion on the lakeshore.  She begins seeing images of a pale faced man (played by director Harvey) appearing and disappearing outside her car, in her boarding house, outside her window, etc.  The film deals with her attempts to come to terms with this vision, her sanity, her brush with death, and what role the old building (a former bath house, carnival, and dance hall) has to do with it all.<br />The film looks crisp and clear, even in night scenes.  No surprise, also, that it has an industrial film feel to it at times.  The acting is good, but not great.  Then again the occasional stiffness of some characters adds to Mary Henry's feeling of disconnect with the living world.  The townspeople have barely more life in them than the pale \\"zombies\\" that rise from the lake.  Mary's job as a church organist allows for a soundtrack full of pipe organ music that morphs from inspirational to horrific.  It is quite effective and adds to the already dreamlike quality that oozes from the film.<br />The Criterion DVD comes with 2 discs including the original director's cut and the theatrical versions.  Extras include a booklet, a photo gallery and history of the bath house, and a panel interview at a convention featuring Herk Harvey (wearing his ghostly make-up no less!), Candace Hilligoss, and Sidney Berger, who played Mary Henry's (...) drunken neighbor.  <br />People spend millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars trying to scare you, and almost always fail.  Carnival of Souls succeeds and on a tiny budget.  There is a reason that this small film from 1962 is still a cult favorite today.  It works.  It's scary.  It will creep you out.  Buy it, rent it, just watch it!
0385507755|4.0|James Frey's memoir will take you on a wild ride, one that's certainly not for the squeamish. It's raw, convincing, tense, taut and compulsively readable. It's also at times a bit too much. Frey's style is unique and stripped down, with unconventional punctuation rules and almost-cloying repetition. There were times when his style seemed to over-complicate or over-state the emotions and events in his story. He could have stepped back from it in more than a few places for a simpler, and I think, more effective read. In these sections, the prose loses its sharpness and the style gets away from him. <br />Still, it's worth it. It's a broken life put back together on unusual terms.
B00000I07R|5.0|At the end of 1992, I listened what I still consider the absolute best Bon Jovi CD, period.  The album is called Keep the Faith.  As a matter of fact, even as the rock alternative fan that I am, I still consider this album as one of the 20 greatest CD of all time, maybe even in my personal top 10 albums ever.  Too bad they never released a CD as good as that after that one... <br />Why I like that CD ?  Because it rocks !!!  The slows are awesome, the heaviest songs are really heavy (Fear, and especially If I was your mother) and all the other songs are great, too.  Hey, I truly believe Dry County has the best guitar solo for a Bon Jovi song, and it's still one of my favorites solos EVER !!!<br />If you like rock, but you hated Bon Jovi's These days, Crush and Bounce, buy this CD anyway, because that's what rock music is missing today.
B00013EY7Q|3.0|There were times during the movie when I felt I was watching a travel show sponsored by the Japanese tourism board. The \\"wowing\\" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.<br />To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking Japanese in a totally vain hope that his politeness would make his American listener understand his diagnosis. Even a translator doesn't have enough mastery of English to get a commercial director's message across to her American client. A prostitute could not even properly say the word \\"rip.\\" On a rare occasion when the movie does not seek to cultural-shock the audience with a language joke, a Japanese teenager is spotted reading a pornographic comic in the public.<br />To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.<br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.<br />However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes would have plunged the movie into boredom. But also because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because the mood is mainly generated by location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. But as I have just mentioned, these things wear thin. If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).<br />Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and in a sense, distant. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.

B00005RDRO|5.0|My roommate and I happen to stumble across this side splitting movie just the other day.  From the very moment the movie began the both of us were on the floor dying with laughter.  From the uncanny way each person represented a famous mystery detective to the plain jist and out come of the plot, this is a great movie to just die over.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We have just seen &quot;Wicked&quot; in NYC and bought the cast album, which we played all the way to Maryland.  As a chorale singer, I can envision chorales across the country singing the score of this musical in years to come.  It may not be &quot;West Side Story&quot; now as some other reviewers would have liked but remember that music that is loved is played over and over again before it ever gets to icon status.  &quot;Popular&quot; is a fun piece but &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is the graber and will get attention on the radio airwaves.
1577311523|3.0|Well, you'll love it or hate it.  That seems to be the pattern of these reviews.  They range from all out worship, well thought out disagreements, recommendations for better or more classical approaches, or those that just like being contrary.<br />I personally have been both a lover and hater of this philosphy at different times.  When I love it, I am peaceful.  When I hate it, I'm in pain and fearful.  Or is it the other way around?  One thing is for sure; the book sure has generated a lot of commotion here.<br />Does he have credentials other than experience?  Nope.  Are some of his observations quirky seen from another point of view?  Yep.  Does he give step by step instructions for those who believe they need them?  Nope.  Does he guide those who are ready to a different kind of awareness? Yep.  <br />Has anyone writing a review actually made it to &quot;enlightenment&quot;?  Is anyone qualified to write a truthful review of this book?  Is it possible the positive reviews are from those hoping to receive &quot;enlightment&quot; or freedom or from those who have had experienced something from the teaching that tells them this is the right direction?  Are the negative reviews from those who just don't get it?  Or maybe the philosophy conflicts with other notions swimming up there in their noggin.  Or maybe they're right and good 'ol Eckart's blown a gasket upstairs.<br />What makes people feel the need to write a review on this book?  Let me ask myself....self why are you writing this?  Ah..an answer.  Because my belief is that Mr. Tolle had these experiences and is a simple and honest man just trying to do what he feels is right by sharing them.<br />If you had been one person, and then by Grace or practise became another, and that new person was joyful and peaceful, would you tell people about it?  No, you'd just go around all happy and when people asked you how you did it, you'd smile knowingly.<br />Read the book.  If you don't want to chance the purchase, borrow one from a friend.  If it speaks to you, go for it.  If it doesn't keep looking until you find the book or teacher that does.
B00004WIDR|3.0|I loved Jurassic Park, sort of, but this was sorely disappointing in so many ways. First, I know that a movie can't follow a book to a &quot;T&quot; but this one went off into outer-space! For the most part the movie didn't even take place in the same setting! Also, the feel was all wrong, character and plot manipulation rivals that of &quot;Queen of the Damned.&quot; If you read the book don't watch the movie ever, it will leave you with a sour taste.

0385504209|2.0|Ok, Dan Brown, we know you're smart; stop hitting us over the head with it! Why don't we use some of that energy that was used in all those puzzles and plot twist to make some likable characters. Heck, I'd settle for un-likable characters over these flat stereotypes. There was a very smart idea in this book. But instead of letting it shine dully through a well crafted novel, Brown lets it blind blatantly without any sort of veil. I felt like I was at a lecture at some points in this book. And when it did that, this novel lost any saving grace. I love learning new things when I read fiction, but more than anything I love a good story and the Da Vinci code was severly lacking in that department. Online customer, save yourself the hassle; I'm sure a movie is on the way, save the time and fork up the 7.50.
0385504209|4.0|The plot is not as good as one would hope. The best part about this book is that the theories about the Holy Grail, whether they are true or not, are interesting to read.<br />There is a lot of insight to how references to the Grail and the lost feminine are hidden in art, like Da Vinci's and other painters. The facts are interesting to read, but sometimes Brown's history lesson takes away from the story. At points in the book he goes on for pages that are just about religious history. The result is the story was not as good as it could have been.
0790729628|1.0|I find this film unbearable. The acting is very sub-par. Harrison Ford isn't good . The dialogue is forced and trite. The character development is non-existent. At no point in the film did I care what was going on. I wanted a giant asteroid to obliterate everyone so the film would end. Also...why, oh WHY, is Rutger Hauer running around in his boxers and slamming his head through walls?! It doesn't make sense, nor is it even slightly entertaining.<br />I have never been so angry after watching a film. It put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. _Blade Runner_ is probably the least entertaining film ever made. I would rather have an anvil dropped on me than be subjected to this film again. Avoid this film (as well as another horrible &quot;classic,&quot; _Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb_) at all costs.<br />(sidenote: the special effects are quite good)
B0000AQVCL|4.0|There's nothing remotely original about the band Jet or their album Get Born. The album cover shamelessly apes Klaus Voorman's drawing/photo collage style from Revolver. Listening to the first track, \\"Last Chance,\\" I felt I'd stumbled into an AC/DC album on the verses, and a lost track from the hard-poppin' mid-'60s Beatles sound-alikes the Knickerbockers on the choruses.<br />Both Dewey Finn and Beavis and Butt-Head would love this album: these musicians, unlike the White Stripes, take classic rock not just as an inspiration, but as a template. Snippets of the Kinks, the Beatles, the MC5, Iggy and the Stooges, and the Ramones (and the Knack, for that matter) fly out at you like shards off a steel grinder. Singer Nic Chester lets out a Roger Daltrey-style Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah! on almost every cut. Most of the lyrics are about hip-shakin', long-legged women in high boots. It takes three tracks before there's enough of a breather for a guitar solo, and then it's deliciously short. <br />The rest of the tunes follow from there. And they're fabulous. It's all jangle-crunch guitars, tubby bass, falling-down-the-stairs drums, and throat-shredding singing, with the occasional tambourine, organ, and piano thrown in. No song outstays its welcome-because they range from less than two to not quite five minutes long. Even the ballads are decent, probably because they rip off the Rolling Stones.<br />And of course there's that iPod commercial song, \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\" You know it: \\"One two three take my hand and come with me 'cuz you look so fine that you know I wanna make you mine,\\" and then the riff taken straight from \\"Lust for Life.\\"<br />At one point, Chester sings \\"Now I'm in a rockin' band,\\" and I have only one word to say to that:<br />Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is a powerful and insightful film about one of the most fundamental of personal inquiries purpose. In other words, it is a movie about soul searching. Virtually all of us, at some point in time, will ponder our place in this world asking who we are, what we are supposed to do, and with whom we are supposed to be. Most individuals likely do not have to struggle with this question, either because they do not care, or because they simply occupy themselves with the routine and mundane fascinations of daily life, ignoring the deeper and more troubling nature of their existence. For others, however, the question of purpose in life can be a haunting, even paralyzing, burden. For those individuals who have personally felt this weight, it feels as if you are lost in the world. You do not know who you are, where you are going, or what you want. You feel melancholy, listless, and numb. You are not amused by the small trappings of daily life, and you want nothing more than to break out of the routine, and find your way. But, because finding the way is so difficult, you often drown yourself in sorrow and doubt. <br />Now, revealing these innermost thoughts is extremely difficult to do in a movie. At best, viewers are given small vignettes by a character's crying, their apathetic attitude, or, in rare instances, through dialogue where a character articulates their feelings in spoken word. \\"Lost in Translation\\" reveals the internal dilemma of the two main characters, who are both experiencing the feeling of being lost, by creating an analogy. The analogy is being in a foreign country, where the language, customs, mannerisms, and culture are vastly different from that which is familiar to you; for example, two Americans in modern-day Japan. A foreigner in such a position often does not understand where they are going, feel grossly out of place, and cannot take advantage of simple daily amusements. Stuck in such a situation, one might be tempted to simply stayin their hotel room, or lose themselves at the bar night after night. While not a perfect analogy, it is a visually intense way at revealing, albeit imperfectly, the feeling of an individual struggling with their place in the world. <br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" avoids any deep philosophical analysis of this problem. It does not give an answer to the character's questions. It does not provide any hidden meaning of life. It does not attempt to make sense out of the confusion of life that can consume us and rightfully so. For those that struggle with the question of purpose, an answer is rarely presented. Some may have an epiphany, finding themselves in a moment of clarity. Others are not so lucky. The question of purpose is fundamental, and, as revealed by the characters in this film, is often a life long inquiry facing us at the beginning of life (Charlotte) or in the middle of well-traveled life (Bob). <br />What hope the film does provide is that we may find someone in life with whom we can share our experiences. This, in reality, is usually the best hope of all. We may never come to grasp with our struggle to find a place in the world. But by struggling together, it makes life bearable, and even, enjoyable. This is the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. It is not sexual. And it is not simply friendly. It is a deep connection a bond that allows them to overcome their melancholy, venturing through life together. Just as it is a far better experience for a foreigner to visit a foreign country with a friend. It is not that the two individuals combined have any better sense of direction or feel any less out of place. But they share the experience of being lost together relating and empathizing with each other, and depending on each other for support. A bond between two such lost souls is often more powerful than the disposable sexual relationships that permeate our culture today. <br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" does not attempt to answer the questions faced by the characters. It simply shows them, as best as can be done through cinema. The film may frustrate the audience, being that it is slow and meandering at times, ambiguous, and unresolved. This reveals the brilliance of its direction. The audience will feel what the characters themselves feel. This is the entire intention of the film. It highlights the frustration and disappointment that some feel in this world. It shows that even though there may be someone in this world with whom we could connect - sometimes that connection is not possible.<br />Cinematically, this film is superb. Which is also very very funny. If you understand the purpose of the film, every aspect of direction contributes to the overall experience of sharing and understanding the sadness and confusion of the characters which is exactly what the two characters are doing for each other, sharing and understanding! Bill Murray does a fantastic portrayal of Bob. Only someone with his comedic skill could portray the sarcastic and subtle comedy of Bob's character. Scarlett Johansson is absolutely brilliant. She portrays the young, well-educated, but lost Charlotte without coming across as idealistic or portentous or philosophical-for-philosophy's sake. Her character is absolutely genuine, struggling with life even though she ostensibly has all those \\"traditional\\" indicia of happiness and success: a hansom husband, money, connection to fame, opportunities for world travel, and an Ivy League education. Bill Murry deserved the Oscar for this film though, he is hilarious. A must see film for everyone.

B00018D3RI|5.0|This DVD set is awesome!  The picture quality is terrific and it is great to watch the episdoes in their entirity without commerials!  Having been only 5 when the series was on in the 70s, it is great to watch these episodes now and appreciate how fantastic this series was!  The extras are good, but the Behind the Badge segment on Disc 5 is probably the best - there are in-depth interviews about how the show came to be.  I must say that every episode on this DVD set is great and Season 1 may very well be the best of the series.  Looking forward to the remaining seasons coming out for us long waiting Starsky &amp; Hutch fans!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I first listened to Interpol after months of hearing buzz and then various friends with different tastes who do not reccommend music to me usually each agreeing that this is the kind of band I would love. I am a big New Wave and electronica infused rock fan, so I was very excited to hear them. ...BR>The devirginizing (from Interpol - not my ex-girl...) took place in a friend's car and bewildered me as we listened to NYC and other depressing songs that seemed incredibly not \\"Ari Weiss\\" or New Wave energetic. Another friend who came to stay with me over the summer from Houston, gave me the CD and I had my sophomore listen.<BR>'Very Strokes,' I thought. 'Mixed with the maturity, patient structures, and emotion of Coldplay.' I was not getting into it. I liked The Strokes and Coldplay better on their own. But now that I had this coveted album, I was going to give it a chance, as a good deal of music deserves, even when not the most desirable first listens.<BR>Finally, I started catching onto songs like \\"PDA,\\" \\"Stella Was A Diver and She Was Always Down,\\" \\"Untitled,\\" and \\"Obstacle 1,\\" all fairly electrifying afterall. And I began to feel for the ones more like \\"NYC.\\" \\"Untitled\\" is a little melancholy like that too, which adds to the sophistication of the album for me as most of the tracks have this delicate balance of emotions. <BR>I started to get really angry with \\"Say Hello To Angels\\" and \\"Stella.\\" All of the songs became undeniably catchy. But that was only the beginning.<BR>Soon, I was obsessed with the darkness this album exuded, that was so cathartic when coupled with the passionate, energizing musicianship. It is that quality of darkness tinged energy that sticks with me and allows all of the thoughtful lyrics to sink in and resonate with me. It is now the album I crave more consistently than any other since last summer. It may leave my CD player finally, but it always returns, and (for lack of a better cliche) with a vengeance.<BR>A+
0385504209|1.0|I didn't read &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  I was about to when I read the FAQ on the book's website and was appalled by the shallowness of Dan Brown's answers.  It was his answer to, &quot;HOW MUCH OF THIS NOVEL IS BASED ON FACT?,&quot; which really disappointed me.  The bulk of his response was, &quot;The paintings, locations, historical documents, and organizations described in the novel all exist.&quot;  Thriller or not, this book is passed off as being historically accurate and full of facts (which has been been commented on by numerous reviewers here and elsewhere).  I expect a lot more information regarding his sources and research when he has unlimited space on the net (I didn't notice a bibliography in the back of the book either).<br />I would probably enjoy this book as a mystery, but the way he presents this book seems devious and unethical which is why I chose not to read it.

I would have preferred dual-layer dvd's rather than flippers, also.<br />I often wondered why the producers didn't use Bruce Lee for the main role. If, however, Caine is supposed to be half Chinese, it is clear why Bruce Lee wasn't used for the part. It is often difficult to discern a half asian individual from any dark-haired, dark-eyed caucasian (I know, I live with some)(They should have darkened Carradine's hair and eyes -- or at least his eyes when he was bald). It's pretty humorous when all the old west cowboys immediately notice that Caine \\"has some yellow blood\\". <br />After listening to the creators talk about why Lee wasn't used (\\"I just couldn't understand the guy\\"), I have to agree. Just listen to his line \\"I wee wo mon\\" (I will old man) in Enter the Dragon and imagine listening to this week after week. Don't get me wrong, I love Bruce Lee's movies, but I love them for the action, not the clearly delivered dialogue and philosophy. His son, Brandon, would have been perfect for the role, however.<br />Anyway, If you liked the original series and are not a rabid videophile, you will probably like the dvd set also. It would have been better if they provided the original full screen AND the wide screen version. Maybe they'll come out with the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" in a year or so. Even my kids like the old series, and why not? They were raised on the Care Bears; not that much different than Kung Fu, in philosophy anyway!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I agree with another reviewer who pointed out that if the director had not been named Coppola, this movie would never have seen the light of day. This is, quite frankly, a movie in which nothing happens. When my wife and I saw it in a movie theater, we followed a stream of others out the exit about midway as the movie lumbered along. That the movie was nominated for Oscars says something about the \\"avant garde,\\" but I don't know exactly what that would be.
079284131X|5.0|Charles Lee Ray \\"Chucky\\" is a serial killer who gets shot and killed in a toy store. Thinking his life wasn't over, before he dies he transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll.<br />Andy is a 6 year old boy who wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday. His mom (Catherine Hicks) buys him one off of a homeless man. She brings the doll home and Andy is thrilled, but what Andy and his mom doesn't know is that the homeless man sold her the doll with the evil spirit of Charles Lee Ray.<br />My favourite scene is when Andy's mom finds out that Chucky is alive; the doll is working without batteries. She threatens Chucky to throw him into the fire unless he talks. He has a tantrum just to get out of her grasp. Chucky leaves the apartment...<br />This movie was scary but at the same time funny. Chucky keeps getting shot and he is still moving...what the heck??? I give Child's Play 5 stars because the story was very unique.
0385336810|4.0|I have been reading some serious stuff and wanted to enjoy something light and fun. And what better way to do that than to read Sophie Kinsella's new novel? I was skeptical at first. I mean, could this novel be as good as the Shopaholic series? The answer is a resounding yes. Can You Keep a Secret? kept me turning the pages until the late hours of the night. Emma is hilarious! The situations that transpire after she discovers that the man she'd revealed all of her embarrassing secrets to during a turbulent flight is her company's top dog had me in hysterics! Emma is just as self-deprecating as Becky Bloomwood. She has the same fun tone -- that unmistakable Kinsella style. And I liked her takes on office politics and how the marketing industry is like. The only bad thing about the novel is Jemima. Could a character be any more annoying?!<br /><br />This has proven that Ms. Kinsella has talent that transcends the Shopaholic series. She has other stories and interesting characters to write about. But that does not mean that the reader has heard the last of Becky, for a new Shopaholic novel will be out later this year. Though it wouldn't have mattered to me whether or not it was a Shopaholic book -- I'd buy anything by this author. Sophie Kinsella has become one of my favorite chick-lit writers. I can't recommend this fun gem enough!
B0001FR3IG|4.0|Gothika had so much hype around it that I had to see this movie, and I'am glad I wasn't dissapointed. This film would be a great addition to any collection out there. If you are a fan of good thrillers then you will love this. There are a ton of goog scares on this film, even when you can sense it coming you still have to jump. Like when she bent down and that girl was behind her, or when the girl was in the pool I had to jump.<br />The casting for this film was great, they couldn't have cast it any better. Halle Berry did an excellent job on this film. She did an even better job then I thought she was capable of. Penelope Cruz did an amazing job with her part on this film, in fact the same could be said for Robert Downey Jr., Charles Dutton, John Carroll Lynch, and Benard Hill. The entire cast did amazing work on this film.<br />On the production side Sebastian Gutierrez wrote a wonderfull script. What kind of mind do you have to have to think of this. Also Mathieu Kassovitz did a great job directing this film, along with Mattew Libatique they shot this film amazingly. The camera work on this film is great. Also Limp Bizkit's remake of Behind Blue Eyes is a great addition to this gloomy film.<br />Other then the questions left at the end like How did Halle and Penelope get out, they still did murder people so that dosn't make sense. But the ending with the little boy makes up for it.<br />Over all this is a good film, while at times predictable it's still pretty good. I would say it is worth buying, I recommend it.
B000002WU9|5.0|The best blaxploitation/drug/gangster/ghetto coming of age/Honk Kong action flick ever made as a Hip-Hop album.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|A Beautiful Mind (ABM) has become a paramount work of Ron Howards, ranking on Internet Movie Database (IMDb) as 246 in the top 250 movies. ABM tells the story of Dr. John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe), a young, introverted scholar. The story of Nash picks up in the late 1940's when he is at Princeton, and starting his doctoral program. Although Nash is not a stereotypical genius, his work speaks novels about his mind. Nash was once told that he was given two helpings of brains and one of heart. <br />     Soon after, Nash comes up with a genius economic theory that blasts his competition out of the water, giving him a choice on where he wants to continue his studies. He chooses Wheeler Labs in an MIT campus, where he meets Alicia Larde (Jennifer Connelly) while teaching. The love story starts immediately at this point, where Alicia starts attracting John by seeing other solutions to problems, and, in essence, challenging him. The heat of the classroom gets to the students, and Alicia stands up, opening the windows John had just closed to politely ask the construction workers to take their work elsewhere while they learn. Aww, again. All the while, John believes he has been working for the government decoding numbers that were plastered on a wall.<br />      Alicia and John start a romantic affair after they stand under the stars, connecting \\"dots\\" as stars, making little things like an octopus. Their tryst begins in a restaurant where John is late, but brings a gift for Alicia. He remembers a line from their time standing outside at the formal event about her love for colours, and the prism he gives her shows every colour in the spectrum. Of course, this is a love story, and the expected \\"aww!\\" comes here.  <br />     All the while, John is fighting in his own mind with three specific characters: William Parcher (Ed Harris), Charles Herman (Paul Bettany), and little Marcee Herman (Vivien Cardone). Parcher has John convinced that the Russians are after him, and that ifhe dares speak to anyone about the confidential work he is engaged in, Parcher will let the Russians after him. The self-proclaimed prodigal roommate of Charles comes during John's days at Princeton during the doctoral program. Marcee is Charles' niece, and seems to be with Charles all the time.<br />     When the characters come to the realization that Nash is indeed, `crazy in love' with his work, they also see that the people John talks about never seem to appear at social functions, such as his wedding. John is committed to a psychiatric facility while giving a guest lecture at a university. After being subjected to multiple treatments of insulin shock therapy, John finds himself competent enough to battle the illness on his own. Fast forward to 1994, John is approached by a committee which nominates him for the nobel prize in economics for the game theory.  John accepts it, and gives a speech about his wife, Alicia. Aww.<br />     This movie starts out as totally intriguing one, but as much as I adore it, let us  face it, it's a total love story, and I am a sap. Although this isn't a normal slap-you-in-the-face plot, the more subtle approach is cute. \\"I need to believe that something extra ordinary is possible...,\\" says Alicia to John, proving her strong love for him. It was extra ordinary on how Howard pulled this film to such a beautiful presentation and plot.
0812550706|4.0|Ender (Andrew) Wiggin is the result of a genetic experiment - he is a cross between his two superintelligent siblings Peter, who is too cruel to be a good commander, and Valentine, who is to kind-hearted. He is sent to battle school at the age of 6 in order to be trained to save the world from the strange insect-like aliens called &quot;buggers&quot;.<br />Orson Scott Card admits that the story is plainly told. However, it has nuances. They aren't poetic nuances like other quality fiction tends to have - they are philosophical. I'd say that this book, and the rest of this series, is for adult readers who are interested in the big questions. Who are we? How did we get here? What's the meaning of life? How did life arise? How should we live our lives? Etc. etc. The author has an uncanny knack for telling the story in a way which makes the facts point in the direction of several different conclusions: This knack is even more apparent in the later books of the series. This means that the book actually DOES move on several different planes. However, it's possible that you need a background in science and/or philosophy to get this.<br />This book is heavily inspired by game theory. This is one of my criticisms of the book: I didn't find it believable that battle school used such naive game tactics that Ender manages to radically change the way they fight. But it might be necessary for the development of the story - and to introduce readers to game theory from the ground. It's also based on a scientifically unsound view of how insect colonies work, but this may be because of the age of the book - science has moved forward since then. Besides, the author can claim poetic licence.<br />Ender is an Anakin Skywalker of sorts - but while Ender uses his gifts to try to save the world with the support of his teachers, Anakin is so seduced by his own abilites that he turns to the &quot;dark side&quot; - but still manages to be the &quot;one who creates balance to the force&quot;.How Ender deals with his giftedness is controversial, and I'd also NOT recommend this to young readers lest they should be inspired to be an Ender, but end up like Darth Vader instead.....<br />Ender's game is a fascinating thought experiment and action story, one star deducted for some lack of credibility in the story. I also agree with the author that the later books are stronger: The philosphical issues truly come into play there. Some of the book's loose ends also tie up later in the series.
B00008RV1M|5.0|Christian Bale plays a crazy psycho and kills women. He looks like hes posessed by a demon when he throws that chainsaw down a flight of stairs hittin a [woman] stright in the back. really shows that hes got the stright sickness, and thats what makes the movie so great. Alota funny parts also, definetly worth watching, ... great movie
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best show I have ever seen.  There are many reviews listed here that go into detail about the show, so I am not going to.  I will, however, state that anyone I have made sit and watch the first disk was hooked: three people, in fact, have went out and bought the set for their own collection.  I have found that the show appels to all.  Take a chance and see what all the fuss is about!!
B0000035E7|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the best album Nirvana came up with. Yeah the production is bad, but for me that only makes it sound better(cause i like raw sounding music). It's raw, not many(if any) overdubs, it's dirty, and it's slow and pounding.  It's got my favorite Nirvana song of all time &quot;Blew&quot; on it,  as well &quot;About a Girl&quot;.  I dont think there is a bad song on it.  and who needs to be creative to make good music? i dont get these guys who dis it cause &quot;it's an imitation&quot;. even if it was, i wouldnt care. It still sounds good. If you call yourself a Nirvana fan, you MUST have this. If you dont have this album, get it. If i could have one Nirvana album, it would be this one. But thats my opinion. oh well. night
0553801546|5.0|Every now and again you encounter a character so profoundly moving and real that you have a hard time believing he's fictional; one who shakes you up and alters your world to the point where it makes you feel silly for getting so involved in a book, and then you reread your favorite scenes and it happens all over again, and eventually you have to stop feeling silly in order to just focus on feeling.<br />This book gutted me. The Fool is incomparable.<br />But don't just pick up Fool's Fate without having read the rest of the series. Start with the Assassin books, skip the Liveship Traders if you're in a hurry (I was), then read the Tawny Man series in order. If you read Fool's Fate on its own, you may still be struck with Hobb's fabulous storytelling and the intricate nature of her world. But you'll miss the opportunity to slowly fall in love with her characters as they grow and develop. Do not deprive yourself of getting to know the Fool through Fitz's eyes.<br />I think I'm in the minority; I hope that Hobb will never write another book in this series. Fool's Fate left me with such a bittersweet sense of completion that I don't see how a new tale could compare. I love the Fool, and I miss him, but I won't let my &quot;reader's greed&quot; for a sequel interfere with the Fool's powerful final sacrifices, and the beauty of untouched, lingering possibility.
B00009EIQE|5.0|I read too many reviews where the first line beings to the effect of &quot;The album wasn't as good as [the last]...&quot; or &quot;...If you like the style of [the previous]...&quot; But, seriously, who cares?  If you like Buddy Guy, whether you like his first album or his last, you will like this album.  If you like the blues, you may have even more of an appreciation for it.  &quot;Blues Singer&quot; is a well recorded, great sounding album containing some of BG's best blues, electric or not.
B00012QM8G|2.0|The critics are right.  The case is cardboard, most shocking because it won't hold up over time.  The critics are also right about the break in the film.  <br />The break is at a critical point in the film and the interruption is extremely frustrating.  So what, its a flipper, I can live with this, but the breaking point that was chosen really is terrible.  <br />More whining, maybe, but everyone have a valid point - this DVD definitely could have been done better.  <br />5 star film.  Presentation 2.
B0001611DI|4.0|It doesn't bother me that this 1 disk edition will soon be replaced by a 3 DVD collector's set. It's good marketing, and the wait simply means the box is going to be that much better. Granted, we've been waiting a good long time for Anchor Bay to release their end-all-to-end-all box set, but if we get everything available, it should be worth the wait.<br />This is the 128 minute US Theatrical cut of the film, featuring what Romero felt was the best runtime, a good ballance between the gore, comedy, and character development, with the 'complete' score by The Goblins. The 139 min. version was rushed together to play at the Cannes Festival in 1978, and as such, is simply an extended rough cut. I'm personally glad that Romero can honestly state he likes a tighter, shorter version of his own film. If only most others could do the same, we wouldn't have to own each of their movies 10 times over - but, so is the game of &quot;Director's Cuts&quot;. Remember, 'longer' doesn't always mean 'better', though it certainly can.<br />I'm personally hoping that the 3 DVD set coming in the fall will include Argento's &quot;Zombi&quot; cut, the Theatrical cut, and a whole lot of extras (Document of the Dead, maybe? I don't think Synapse has it anymore.), making it work with the single DVD rather than against it, but we'll just have to see.<br />I don't know what I can say about the film that hasn't been said before; excellent film, funny and action packed, holds it's own against the current dreck like Resident Evil and House of the Dead without even trying. The new Dawn, while not a total thrashing of the original (like, say, the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre), simply isn't half as good. Go with the original. You'll thank me for it if you ever get suckered in to watching the new one after viewing the original.<br />Anyhow, the DVD itself is great; Stunningly gorgeous 16:9 transfer, suprisingly good DTS audio, a brand new comentary, I think if fans didn't already know the box set was coming, they'd be on their knees thanking Anchor Bay for this marvelous DVD. But, for those of you who don't want to have to buy it twice, wait and see what the box brings. I have a feeling I'll own them both.<br />Romero's masterpiece deserves no less. Now, if only that new set would contain the 150 min. German composite print...<br />And, by the way. There is no alternate ending. It was written in the script that everyone dies, but never filmed for various reasons. If you want to see how much Romero's &quot;Dead&quot; films often veer off from how they were written, find the original screenplay for 'Day of the Dead'. It's barely recognizable compared to the finished film.<br />Getting 4 stars, only because we're sure to get a lot more fun when the box set comes out this Fall.
0780631684|2.0|well i have the say i missed this on when it first came our but i saw FD2 and i liked it but seeing this one, it kinda turned me off from the start, why must u ask? because the fact that losing two family memebers in the WTC haunts me till and the graphic scenes here in the movie gave me a few nightmares to what it was like to see my relatives to blow up which is very disturbing. i know you may not agree on what i have to say but i think in some sense the filmmakers outta ease up on it but other than the 1st scenes it was alright specially when the one kid got smoked by a bus...seen better flicks
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Oh my, well I'm 13, and now I basically love the Beatles now when I heard the song &quot;My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. Whenever we watch this video it brings the whole family together because we all love this DVD. It's so touching.<br />The last song of the concert, &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams&quot; with the ukelele, it's very touching. Makes you want to cry. I can't cry that easily either.<br />I'll sum this whole thing up: If your a Beatles fan, huge or just like one song, you have to get this DVD. You get to see Ringo and Paul together on the same stage for once after a lot of years to do a tribute for their old friend, with the bonus of Paul and Eric singing together beautifully.<br />Heck, I'm watching the concert on my computor right now. So catch ya' later.
0061015725|4.0|Pretty damned good novel from a damned good writer. Would have given it five stars had I not just read NANO by John Robert Marlow. For whatever reason--perhaps he was trying to follow the Jurassic Park formula of a small group trapped in a remote location--Crichton doesn't explore the Big Picture, so to speak. (Marlow's NANO, on the other hand, sets the technology loose on the world--which it threatens to destroy in a matter of hours.)<br />PREY is definitely a worthy read--though the nanotech community is clearly siding with NANO as the better book. (See one nanotech-publication editor's review on the amazon NANO page.)

B000063JZQ|4.0|Over 3 thousand y ears ago there was a man apart from the rest. He was a brilliant man who brought peace and tranquility amongst others, he gave hope back to the people and gave them entertainment when lower class individuals otherwise had none.<br />During the 16 hundred's William shakespear wrote and directed one of his one of his most world renouned plays ever. enhabiting love, tragedy, laughter and pain. This play is known as macbeth.<br />With the art and passion shakespear put into this play, it would forever be next to impossible to recreat in our modern erra and grasp the sights shakespear himself had on the play. with an amazing director called Roman polanski.<br />Pokanski did a remarkable job bringing this amazing play to the bigscreen in 1978, Hey portrayed a great deal of emotion through this saga alowing the viewers to get intouch with the actors as if they were back in teh 1600's watching one of shakespears unbelievable plays.<br />Although the 1970's held weak special effects and the film quality was poor, This was still a raging blockbuster and can easilly be compared to spiderman, starwars and lord of the rings. Not from the special effects or the rulling heroe, but because of the saga itself. * i'ts a classic revailing story or one mans rule upon the kingdom * -Sisco claims-. And this  movie brings enetertainment to an individual and trully grasps the full range of there emotions. It does just what it was first meant to do way back in the in 1606.<BR>I rate this movie ****4 stars**** out of 5.<BR>If you do not care for shakespear and you hate cheesy low budgeted films i dont recomend watching this movie.<BR>If you enjoy shakespear and you enjoy a saga that trully brings hope into your life and connects you with the characters and you dont care if they dont have 20th century special effects this movie is for you.
B000002A3T|5.0|this is by far the greatest cd ever to come out. Sadly it does not get the respect it deserves because of the fact that roger wasnt there any more and no one was willing to give it a fair chance. If You do you are nicfully rewarded with great music.
B00005JLRT|1.0|As a Star Trek fan I consider this to be both the best and worst Star Trek film.<br />This film has excellent special effects and is well written but has the worst mistake ever made in the history of the franchise.<br />The ending of the film was very disappointing and I would have given the movie 5 stars if this plot element was not in the movie.<br />I cannot reveal what it is because the review guidelines do not permit spoilers.
B00000IMCW|5.0|DAWN OF THE DEAD IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER!!!<BR>I HAVE HAD MANY, MANY ZOMBIE DREAMS SINCE 1ST SEEING IT IN 1980.  I recently saw the remake, and I jumped out of my seat only once, during the bathroom window scene.  The movie went downhill from there.  Zombies move fast in the remake, and that's just WRONG!!  People move slowly when they first wake up from sleeping, so imagine how slow people should move after waking up from being dead!  Also, the best zombie in the original Dawn is Steven.  What he does with his foot is CLASSIC!  I highly recommend this film, the original 1978 version of course!!!  Oh yea-I caught something in the remake-when the nurse was in the mall trying on clothes, I saw a sign above a mirror that said &quot;Gaylen Ross&quot;-she played Fran in the original!  I guess that was their tribute to her.  Wonder why Fran &amp; Steven didn't make a cameo appearance like Roger &amp; Peter did?
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Ironic, isn't it, that GNR's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; are some of their worst songs?  I wouldn't accept this CD if someone gave it to me.  What a joke.  A band that could write absolutely brilliant stuff like &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot;, &quot;Mr.Brownstone&quot;, &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;, &quot;Estranged&quot;, etc. wastes their time covering tired &quot;dead horses&quot; (pun intended) like &quot;Live And Let Die&quot; and &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot;.  And those are their hits (along with, on this CD, two punk covers, too!)  Cut the Greatest Hits crap and give us &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;!!!!
B00013F38K|4.0|People seem to concentrate too much on the DVD quality, etc. and not the show.  DVDs seem fine to me, and the philsophical quotes from Caine are as relavant today as they ever were.<br />Rock on Caine.  Can a movie be far behind?
0679311718|5.0|I bought this book a few days after it was released and read it within a week. It is an extremely compelling account of a horrific event from one of the few people who tried to stop it. He looked at dead or orphaned children in Rwanda and saw his own young children. He exhorted the UN and the powerful nations of the world to send him a few thousand troops, so that he could save hundreds of thousands of innocent lives. In the end, political calculus was more important to those nations than the lives of almost a million Africans. This book really changed the way I look at the world. Another really good book for exploring the role of politics in refusing to prevent genocide is &quot;A Problem from Hell&quot; by Samantha Powers.
1590862813|2.0|This is probably the most disappointing audio book I have ever \\"read.\\" Why the reader thought it apt to make the main character, Victor Frankenstein--who was, what, 30? 35 years old maximum?--at the end of this novel sound like a decrepit old Swiss-German professor, is beyond my comprehension. It was so distracting that it interrupted my concentration on the events described countless times, forcing me to have to rewind, listen again, rewind, listen again, .....<br />Also, why, when everyone in the novel is European, are the only ones with non-American accents Victor and a few Irish people?<br />This reader ruined an otherwise fascinating novel for me. If I wasn't stuck on a long drive with nothing else to \\"read,\\" I would have stopped it, and sent it back, and demanded a refund! In my opinion, Tom Casaletto should never be given another book-reading job again.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film is a harrowing experience.  The principle cast of four all spiral to their respective dooms, all fueled by the use of &quot;recreational pharmaceuticals&quot;.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable as buds who see the drug game as a way to escape their lower socio-economic lives, even as they do not see the way that their own abuse of these drugs makes such an escape impossible.  But it is the overpowering performances of Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly that burned a raw place into my psyche.  Ellen Burstyn's Sara is not a junkie.  She is just a lonely, overweight middle-aged woman who dreams about being younger, thinner, and not nearly as alone.  Jennifer Connelly's character comes along for the ride with her boyfriend, but by degrees she descends lower and lower.<br />You have to watch it to see how low these characters fall.  This is not a happy-go-lucky movie.  But if you are interested in a well-made, well-acted cautionary tale about the dangers of addictions, you'd have difficulty finding one superior to &quot;Requiem&quot;.
2913903878|5.0|If I could give this book six stars, I would.<br />There will be a lot of comparisons with &quot;Doughboy to GI&quot; and I think that's unfair. The author very smartly decided to focus on ONE SPECIFIC AREA and timeframe. I applaud his ability to focus his work, unlike so many other &quot;catch-all&quot; books out there. Sure, there's a few gaps and some errors (check out the postwar French guide with the Department of Defense logo on the cover), but overall, my library would be incomplete without this fine reference work. And, he also showed items from OTHER COLLECTIONS. Let this be a trend in books, please! We're all tired of the &quot;Lookit mah kewl collection of stuff, some of which might not be related to the subject&quot; books.<br />This is the standard by which I will judge reference books in the future, and thanks for putting it out in English!!!<br />Hey, why ARE all the best reference books on US stuff done in other countries anyway?

0790729628|5.0|For a film made in 1982, this was really ahead of its time, others have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate it(Judge Dredd &amp; The Fifth Element), In this Harrison Ford is Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner policeman, who kills Replicants, artificial humans used for slave labor &amp; declared illegal on Earth, who trespass, in the year 2019,  four have made their way to Earth &amp; one has already critically wounded his successor, he is called back to elimate them, Rutger Hauer(Ladyhawke) is Roy Batty, the leader who wants more life out of the Tyrell Corporation, who designed them, we learn that they have only a four year life span, a misguided effort to keep them from developing emotions, which Batty has already developed, along with Pris(an unrecognizable Daryl Hannah) &amp; Leon (Brion James of &quot;48HRS) we also meet Rachel(Sean Young) who may also be a Replicant, but is never explained, as is Deckard who may or may not be one, again the viewer has to decide, many great action set-pieces &amp; the visuals are awesome, almost like Courasaunt in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, Ford &amp; Hauer's stand-off at the end is unique in which Hauer plays this role with intensity, &amp; ultimately makes a human decision regarding Ford, won't spoil it here, but is definately a great film with great direction, Ridley Scott(Alien) never lets you stop guessing the film, &amp; keeps you interested til the end, Highy Recommened!!!
B000099T2L|4.0|People , people! What makes B so special and famous (accept her booty)? Fact that she's one of these rare female artist who look awsome and sound great. B has great voice and any1 who heard her singin live can confirm that.But this album, no metter how cool it is, is not giving B power to show her voice in it's best. Songs like Naughty girl, Hip Hop Star and Sings are fun, but they are making B sound like just another sex selling r'n'b one year sensation. Here are my reviews of each song on this album<BR>1.Crazy In Love - this song is verry good, is there anyone who   didn't hear it 4/5<BR>2.Naugty Girl - already mention it , great melody,but vocls are horrid 2/5<BR>3.Baby Boy - second single, just cool,B sounds nice and Sean Paul is cool as always 4/5<BR>4.Hip Hop Star - nice tune,but B is dealing better with deper lyrics 3/5<BR>5.Be With You - one of the best songs I've ever heard,B sounds wonderdfull and chorus is amazing 5/5<BR>6.Me,Myslef & I - third single, cool video,great vocals and lyrics are so real 5/5<BR>7.Yes - verry similar to previous song , nice tune 4/5<BR>8.Sings - I just don't like it, lyrics and vocals are wack,only thing I like is beat 2/5<BR>9.Speechless - verry intimate,verry sexy,B sounds so cool.Thats B at her best 5/5<BR>10.That's How You Like It - this song is so sweet and charming,another duet with Jay-Z 5/5<BR>11.The Closer I Get To You - amazing and sophisticaded .D5/5<BR>12.Dangerously in Love2-unnecesary,but I cold never get tired of this song 5/5<BR>14.Gift From Virgo - this song is verry good 4/5<BR>15.Work It Out -sang,sista,sang 5/5<BR>16.Bonnie & Clyde -don't you just love this song?!5/5<BR>17.Daddy-aw[...] song reminds me of my daddy,who is greatest person on world 5/5<br />There you go! Album made a big fuss because he is verry good.B,if ther's any chance that you'll be reading this, my advice is-more ballads nad deep songs and less club songs. To all people dissing B and her album-B is still trying to find her way as a solo artist,so give her a little more time. Great album,but for real exitments I'm waiting for 2nd album .
0380820846|5.0|Colin Bridgerton is without a doubt, THE most charming man in all of London. One look at his devilish grin or his beautiful green eyes and the women fall at his feet. And with his glib mouth, he can get out of almost anything. Until one day, speaking out of frustration, he claims that he will never marry Penelope Featherington, in PUBLIC. And Penelope heard!    Now years later, after having travelled extensively throughout Europe, the irresistable Mr. Bridgerton is back in London for the season, at the age of 33, while Penelope has become a spinster at 28.    But somehow, things aren't the same. When Colin looks at Penelope, he's struck by how big her eyes are and what a dreamy shade of brown they appear to be and how voluptous her body is. Not to mention how intelligent and funny and witty and kind she is.    Penelope, on the other hand, has known how amazing Colin was since 2 days before her 16th birthday. And she is surprised that he would even express such interest in her, let alone ask for her hand in marriage! But Colin's determined to make Penelope his, and he is willing to prove his love to her.    The mysterious identity of Lady Whistledown is revealed here, even though I think that any avid reader of the Bridgerton series would have figured it out by the second book.    It's a pleasure to read.
0142004235|3.0|Although I have not finished the book,East of Eden, I believe I have read enough of it to critique it. <BR>The book is set in the early 20th century in the Salinas valley of California. The book is separted into three parts, two of which I have read. The two main characters are both men, one lives in California and one lives on the east coast. The two characters don't meat untill about 200 pages into the book. Each character has an interesting life, but the book seems to focus more on the character Adam, more than the other, Samuel. The character that lives in California, Samuel, has a family of 9 and is a very intelligent man. The character that lives on the east coast, Adam, grew up with an emotionally cold and detached military father. He and his older brother lived as bachlors untill Adam was about 40. <BR>The begining of the story moves very slow, it is only when a third character is introduced, Cathy, that the story becomes interesting. Adam finds her beaten on his door step, nurses her back to health and marries her, but Cathy is an almost inhuman woman and never wanted to marry Adam. She is cold, distant, and calculated. Her real personality is shown by how she reacts to her and Adam's two sons when she gives birth. <BR>John Steinbeck has given this story a plot similar to that of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. There is that type of sibling jealously not only between Adam and his brother, but also between Adam's two sons. Steinbeck rarley has all the charactes in this book coexist. For the most part, each chapter is about a speific character and their individual life, not how they exist with the other main characters in the book.<BR>Overall I would say that this book moves much too slow for most readers. Although the detail is great, there is very little action or excitement. Every time the book seems like it is picking up, it goes right back to its slow pace. Out of what I have read so far, there has mabey been one whole page of action, combined. If you enjoy a long book full of vivid detail, this book is for you, but if you prefer drama and excitement in your reading, you will most likley not enjoy this book. On a scale of one to five, I would give this book a 3.
B00005QG9J|1.0|Let's see, where do I begin? Apparently I can't look the other way without Incubus being all the rave now. I have a little secret to say to all this Brandon Boydites: GET A LIFE! Incubus is not orignal at all. The Cure has been doing music like this for 24 years. Incubus is nothing but a lame version of The Cure and Red Hot Chili Peppers (a band I absoultly hate), and no, they are not rock. This is music for 15 year old girls who got tired of listening to Backstreet Boys and wanted to listen to Incubus in order to seem smart. Well, no. If you want intelligent music, try The Cure's Disintegration, or some early Pink Floyd. Avoid this at all costs.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I rented this movie thinking it was going to be funny and entertaining... How can a movie like this be nominated for an Oscar? It is terribly slow and the dialogues are far from intelligent. It could have been a very interesting introduction/discovery of the Asian culture. I found it stupid and a permanent demonstration that the american culture is superior to the local one (usually the attitude that ignorant people assume when they visit a foreign country!). I would have given it -5 stars if that option was available!<BR>Sofia Coppola... pfff!!! If her name was Sofia Smith she would still be selling popcorn at the theater, not sitting at the Academy Awards ceremony.
B0000640SA|3.0|this movie was certainly different than most i have seen. i really liked the end, but with all of the different time-changes it got to be a bit confusing. i'd say its about 3 1/2 stars. it definitely makes you think and pay attention, though it's easy to get lost with everything going on.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Well, we finally get one of the best albums of 2003... at least I can say its worth the wait.  I have completely fallen in love with this cd.  It gives me a similar feeling to listening to White Blood Cells for the first time, or OK Computer, or 40 Oz. to Freedom, or Undertow... that feeling that you are listening to something new, something different, something... classic.  I can't deny that this band is clearly influenced heavily by Radiohead, but there is something else there.  Apparently the band says their two main influences are Radiohead (who I love) and Nirvana, who just happens to be far and away my favorite band of all time.  The sound of this album is sort of an amped-up Ok Computer.  The vocals are beautiful... like Thom Yorke but with better range.  <br />I have read that some people aren't impressed by the lyrics, but I feel that to be nitpicking.  A lot of songs, like Absolution, have beautiful and moving lyrics.  Muse have a great sound, involving piano/keyboards, string/orchestral backing, electronic stuff a la Radiohead, and guitars that are often much heavier than anything Radiohead would play.  Its just a beautiful sound... and what really makes me like this cd is that every song, EVERY song, is worth listening to.  Thats a rarity, and its what makes a great cd for me.  <br />If you like Radiohead at all, especially the Bends and/or Ok Computer, do yourself a favor and pick up this cd.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I watched this one with my 8 year old niece and my almost 3 year old.  The little one didn't care for it, nothing for her to follow or understand, but I'd say the 6 to 14 year olds will all probably really like it judging by the reaction from my niece.  I thought it was well done and acted and mostly entertaining.  The movie is wholesome without anything I found distasteful or objectionable for the young.<br />I'd recommended owning this one it has lasting value as a family or preteen girl flick.
