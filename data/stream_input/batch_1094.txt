B000002N2N|3.0|I'm a huge fan and love the Ramones!<br /><br />So, how do I not go ga-ga over this classic live album? Quite simply, they were not really such a good live band. It's not that they were a totally \\"bad\\" live band, it's just that their live renditions are totally inferior to the recorded ones. They blaze through the songs with no audience banter, no modification of sounds, no varying of pacing, no accentuation on instruments or vocals, no stretching out of a song, no punctuation points, nothing! Listening to these songs in such a rapid succession gets exhausting since it all starts blending into each other.<br /><br />Setting aside treating the Ramones like some silly, novelty, cartoonish punk act (which they really were not) and properly treating them like a serious and quality band should make you realize what they were good at. The Ramones wrote some fantastic \\"pop\\" songs and Joey, once he found his groove on the 3rd album, \\"Rocket to Russia\\", had an enchanting voice. If you listen to their better songs, you will notice that they have held up wonderfully. \\"Sheena is a punk rocker\\", \\"I wanna be sedated\\", Rockaway Beach\\", \\" I wanna be well\\", \\"Ramona\\", \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", \\"The KKK took my baby away\\" , \\"53rd and 3rd\\" are all well-written and melodic songs. The professionally produced, yet simple, versions properly focus on the strength of the band. In a live context, Joey's shouting it out rather than singing, the buzzsaw of Johnny's guitar is lost, you could barely make out Dee Dee's harmonizing and the drums are practically lost in the mix.<br /><br />\\"It's alive\\" acts as a nice collection of the better songs in the Ramones 1970's repetoire but this should be for completists only. There is no reason to having to have a live recording of this band. For the un-initiated, \\"All this Sutff (and more)\\" or \\"Ramone's Mania\\" will better serve as a compilation than a live one.<br /><br />I'm critical of \\"It's Alive\\" because some had reviewed it as a \\"must have\\", live recording, up there with among the best of all live recordings. That is absurd and an insult to the cream of live cd's that truly captures the energy of the performance. Some bands are meant to be heard live and some better in their recorded versions. The Ramones absolutely fall into the latter category.f all live recordings. That is absurd and an insult to the cream of live cd's that truly captures the energy of the performance.

0385341679|5.0|I've been watching the pre-order record in my library system's catalog wistfully for a week now...and then I couldn't stand thinking about having to wait for the paper copy and caved for the e-book today. Well worth it. I was so terrified there would be another cliffhanger at the end of Shadowfever because that has just KILLED me in past Fever books, but I think what's perfect about this one is that yes, there's definite resolution to issues, but not a tidy wrapping-up of *everything*. Sometimes with end-of-series books like this (I'm looking at you, Breaking Dawn), it feels like the author is just giving free rein to wild fancy in some kind of happy everything-ends-well-regardless-of-logic land, and forces people and events together for the sole reason of plot resolution. I always come away from those books intensely dissatisfied and thinking that the book read like some fangirl's stab at a universe made by someone else. I can't even express how relieved I am that Shadowfever was nothing like this, and even brought much to the table that was new and exciting and full of possibility.<br /><br />One of the most unexpected joys was how naturally characters evolved. Granted, I felt like Mac's introspection got a wee bit lengthy at times when I really just wanted the action to get going again, but I think when I go back and read the book a second time, getting to \\"know\\" her will be more satisfying. The entire book reads like a mystery to uncover her true identity, because she both is and isn't the pink-loving sunshiny Mac from the beginning of the series. Other characters like Barrons and V'lane also went through some truly startling transformations that are never fully explained down to the last detail, only hinting at the depths of emotion and motive beneath the surface.<br /><br />Another thing that continually kept the book fresh was how it jerks the reader back and forth through different possible realities. I was continually wondering whether Mac would succeed in going back in time to alter events, or into the future, or any number of sideways time-corridors, so that I was continually kept off-balance by what actually occurs. While I think most of us fantasy readers have gotten inured to the fleeting and deceptive nature of the concept of time in the genre, the skillfulness that Ms. Moning employs almost makes you believe that she herself was not always sure what was going to happen next. It is a delicious feeling of literary weightlessness that made me want to get back on the ride and do it all over again! I was not at all sad when I finished, because this is obviously not the end of the Fever world!time to alter events, or into the future, or any number of sideways time-corridors, so that I was continually kept off-balance by what actually occurs.

0670877050|5.0|The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.     I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing.  The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true.
B000068FUS|4.0|Let me first get this out of the way...\\"Let ther be rock\\" is such an amazingly kick#&# song that it's worth the price of admission by itself. With a concluding chorus that goes \\"WITH BON SCOTT SINGING LET THERE BE ROCK TOUR\\", you the listener have been royally rocked!<br /><br />As it approaches ten years in age, I have come to view \\" A Southern Rock Opera\\" in a very different manner as opposed to when I first acquired this sprawling and overly ambitious double cd.<br /><br />This is not an easy work to listen to. A lot of the songs are not that melodic and there is a definite sense of doom and gloom that permeates many of the songs. \\"A Southern Rock Opera\\"...they're not kidding! This is truly an ode to the South and everything Skynyrd.<br /><br />When I first listened to this, I thought many of the media reviewers were just caught up with the novelty of a band wearing their \\"southern rock\\" allegiances on their sleeves. I was very wrong in summarily dismissing this band.<br /><br />Since this 2001 recording, \\"Drive By Truckers\\" have been a workhorse of a band putting out a high quality cd almost every year and constantly touring. This is a group where all of the members are not only true contributers but, they also have their own distinct voicings in their songwriting.<br /><br />Since listening to a lot more of the material and seeing them live, I am not able to properly see how extremely personal and sincere this is as a work of art. This is a sinecer and uncompromising account of the songwriters' experiences in growing up in Alabama and their musical influences. The songs do not resemble what would be conventionally be considered a \\"single\\" (except for \\"Let there be rock\\") but rather this is a work to really delve into and listen to the deep, moving lyrics.<br /><br />\\"A Southern Rock Opera\\" improves with repeated listening and a continuing initiation into what the \\"Drive By Truckers\\" are all about.

B001VNB54A|5.0|Pacific is a wonderful series, which brings home the horrors of the war in the Pacific.  The special features are a bit difficult to navigate, and I expect that many people never see the excellent materials that are included with the discs. I would recommend the set to anyone.

B003K16NO8|1.0|I got the Kindle version and after contacting the publisher downloaded the Lesson Files and Images from their website (the URL is at the end of the book... why they didnt put it at the beginning is anyones guess).    The printed content of the book is good and I am sure the training would be great - if only the lesson files worked. The first lesson has a file called \\"Memory Card.dmg\\" but does not load. The other lessons have picture files which will not open on my Mac (with the latest Snow Leopard software version).    Without the lesson files being able to work the book is next to useless so I returned it. Amazon were good and told me that anyone can return a Kindle book in 7 days if they dont like it.    Shame though - it could have been very good. Back to the drawing board.
142334216X|5.0|All I can say is WoW what a journey!!  The first few chapters was so heart wrenching, it would break any fan hearts who have been with Mac from the beginning!! and I simply adored the scene when Mac is reunited with Barrens and the conversation they have!! Ms Monings you are a genius with words and the master of wild unexpected plot lines.  Somethings I totally did not expect! Like V'lane and Dani!!  Well I won't repeat myself with what the other reviews have said so far but I do agree with them in one thing.  This book had the most satisfactory HEA ending for Mac! And this just leaves the burning question of what is next? whom will take the next spotlight in the fever world.  All I know is I sure want to know more about Barrens mens.
B0045ODPKY|1.0|I bought this DVD under the impression that it contains a descriptive video track. If it's there, I can't find it using either my computer or a DVD player. Even more annoying, when I put the DVD in my computer, a window with PC_CLICKME popped up onscreen. Nothing happens when I click on it; pressing alt+F4 won't close it. The only way to get rid of it was to re-start the computer. Of course, the pc_clickme window returned each time I tried to play the DVD.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The show looks great on these discs - all the high-quality visual and audio production shines through. One problem: the deleted scenes are all off by one episode, which was frustrating but not terribly important, as none of them were terribly interesting in the first place.

B0044FEZBC|5.0|The wait is finally over.  Natalia Osipova is, at long last, the featured performer in a full length ballet that has made it to DVD. For those of us who haven't been able to make it to New York, or Europe--to see her in real life--this is cause for celebration, and it's not likely that many will be disappointed.  The Flames of Paris is quintessentially Russian, although, of course, it utilizes the French Revolution of 1789 as an exemplary reflection of its 1917 Russian equivalent;  apparently, the ballet was a favorite of Stalin's (ugh).<br /><br />Be that as it may, the brilliant young Ukrainian choreographer, Alexei Ratmansky, has put a fresh stamp on the storyline, and his creative flair, coupled with the ensemble dances (especially in Act II) that have been retained from the original 1932 Soviet production (choreographed by V. Vaynonen) give the ballet a powerful vitality that should propel it onto more stages around the world.<br /><br />Some of this version's solos, especially by the daring Ivan Vasiliev, are astonishing, and the thoroughly rousing rendition of this balletic example of social/political realism has a very strong heartbeat, highlighted by Osipova's dynamic presence.<br /><br />[For what it's worth, I recently ordered the ballet from Amazon uk (before I knew that it was going to have a U.S. distribution), and paid (for the standard DVD) more than it would cost to get the Bluray here in the U.S..  As you would expect, the BD's video (and audio) is clearly superior to the DVD.  I would also note that because of my enthusiasm (sparked by youtube) for Osipova, I also ordered a set of three DVDs from OsipovaBallet, which it turns out had some of the choreography done by her, but does not feature much of her, except for a couple of youtube-like clips].
0425238091|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend, a medical student at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, NY. Although I am not a medical student, I heard that this book is a must-read for men going to be doctors or are doctors. The book is supposed to give doctors a feeling of, \\"Yes, that is exactly how it all works\\" (in reference to the social/emotional/sexual interactions of being a doctor). Its not very long but it offers a lot and is cheap. I plan on reading it too!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have been awaiting this book on pins and needles since I finished Dreamfever.  I could not put this book down, it robbed me of sleep and now that I am finished with it I am in awe.  This book was so amazingly put together it is a true testimonial of how stellar of an author Karen Marie Moning is.  There are so many twists and turns that just when you think you figured out what is going on, you are SO WRONG.  Do not skip ahead in this book because you will be utterly confused.  If you are reading it prepared to be beaten over the head with shock, horror and sheer excitement.  She pulls out all the punches in this and this single handedly is now my favorite book ever written.  Karen is a modern goddess of the art of writing and we are all unworthy of her work.  Lol.  Prepared to be awed and there should be a higher rating than five stars.  It does not do this book justice.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great DVD. I own most of JM's DVD and this one is by far the one I do most often. It's very easy to make excuses not to spend 45-1 hr working out, but 20 minutes? No excuses! This will not make you loose a vast amount of weight, but it will tone you like you wouldn't believe! Four days and you'll start to see a difference in your arms. One week and you'll notice it in your stomach. If your looking for a huge weight loss, I suggest combining this with 40 minutes of cardio and a healthy diet. Do the DVD first than a cardio workout, I like speed walking on a treadmill. The cardio will help you burn up some serious calories, and I find I'm not as stiff the next day if I walk after doing the DVD. If you want to start the journey of getting into shape, the 30 day shred is a great place to start! After you get the hang of this one, move onto some of her 40 minute DVDs.. they're all great!

B000006OAM|5.0|It's 2011 and a full 8 years after I \\"discovered\\" this album it's still a favorite of mine.  I don't think a single album in my iTunes  folder has as many 4 star or above ratings as this album.  Why?  What is it about this album?    Natalie's voice is perfectly paired to the musical instruments in this album.  Easy to say, nearly impossible - as impossible as perfection itself - to achieve.  It must have been excruciatingly difficult to find the perfect transitions from the pianissimo moments of \\"Thick as thieves\\" to the distorted guitar in the very same song.  All rooted in the foundation of the piano passages, beautifully executed.  You get the same with nearly every other track on the album - \\"King of May\\" and \\"My Skin\\" are extraordinary performances and their lyrics are enveloping.  With every listen you are drawn deeper into their qualities, like a good book that gets better with every chapter.    If you are a pianist and/or vocalist, this is nearly album is nearly nirvana.  The only thing missing is a DVD Audio or SACD version of this album to reveal, in the most excruciating of detail, the last 1000th of nuance to these songs.  After 8 years of listening (maybe less) trust me - you'll crave it.
0312600844|1.0|I cannot, for the life of me, understand the hype around this book.  It was painful to get through - boring, slow, and self-satisfying.  Please don't waste your time or money on this one.
B001AQO3XS|4.0|Let me start off saying that Highlander is one of my favorite all-time movies (ever since I was old enough to see an R-rated movie) and I've been eagerly anticipating the Blu-Ray release of this film.  My biggest complaint is the picture and sound... Now don't get me wrong, this is an incredible improvement over my VHS copy of the Director's Cut but I am moderately disappointed in the video transfer... Extremely grainy video in the scenes with low lighting (so most of the movie right?) but the flashbacks are much crisper/clean. The sound isn't much better. Definitely an improvement over my VHS copy but not up to par with this generation of Blu-Ray releases... You can tell that an inordinate amount of time was not spent on the transfer (unfortunately)...   If I was not such a fan of this film and the cinematography I would rate it much lower but this is a must own for me... I'm not claiming to be an A/V expert but I've read enough (read: know enough) and have watched more than enough films (Blu-Ray) from the 70's and 80's with better transfer standards... I wanted this to be great but I'm satisfied just to have it on Blu-Ray...  So in conclusion, the transfer leaves much to be desired but still is a must own for the die-hard Highlander fan...  And FYI... the Special Features (if you can call them that) do not differ at all from the previous releases of the Director's Cut...
B004HAG40O|5.0|There are few albums that I enjoy from start to finish. 'The King is Dead' however is not one of those albums. From beginning to end this album keeps me hooked. Lyrically beautiful and simply rich with what I come to expect from Colin Meloy and The Decemberists. As a Missoula faithful follower since the early days of Tarkio I can honestly say this album meets all my expectations and leaves me wanting more. Well done Colin!
B00005JMX6|5.0|What a great movie. Someone commented that you would be a different person after watching it. I wouldn't go that far, but I will say I have watched this movie quite a few times, and don't get bored with seeing it again and again. Elisha is extremely  hot and beautiful in this movie. I doubt any other actress could fill her shoes and play the part of Danielle. The soundtrack is very thoughtfully put together also. I recommend  buying this movie. You will want to watch it again and again.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever by Karen Marie Moning<br /><br />(Warning: Spoilers Alert...as always, proceed with caution....)<br /><br />Readers have expectations.<br /><br />Romances should be about love. The story is about the relationship between the hero and heroine. Love saves the day. HEA forever.<br /><br />Women's fiction is about the heroine. Her growth, her journey. Romance might be involved, but ultimately it is the heroine's story.<br /><br />A fantasy is about the story itself. The story is the star of the show...filled with out-of-this-world details, plot twists and turns, gorgeous imagery, shocking imagery. It's most often a plot-driven work, not character-driven.<br /><br />So what happens when a well-beloved romance author decides to write an epic fantasy series? Hmmm. Her fans expect romance. Her readers expect real character development. Some of them might jump on the fantasy bandwagon and enjoy the craziness of it all, but some of them still crave hot sex scenes and a hero to die for.<br /><br />Karen Marie Moning has accomplished something extraordinary with this Fever series. She has transformed Dublin into a mythological battlefield filled with scrappy humans and horrifying imaginary creatures, where every shadow is feared. She created a heroine whose journey transformed her from a fluffy pink priss into a raw warrior. She provided a hero full of mystery, a storyline filled with shocking revelations, simple truths and painful betrayals. And she took the reader on the journey using a first person POV, so that we lived each moment with Mac herself....reveled in the victories, wept at the tragedies, wavered back and forth between hopeful and helpless.<br /><br />This series is exactly what an epic fantasy should be. An adventure. In every way.<br /><br />Now, I'm not gonna tell you that this book was perfect. The beginning was too slow, too repetitive and became frustrating to read. I was tired of Mac being in the dark, because it meant we, the readers, were in the dark, too. I wanted answers. I was tired of not knowing. The whole \\"he's not really dead because he can come back to life\\" thing was too gimmicky. The \\"big misunderstanding\\" plot device going on (Barrons thinking Mac slept with Darroc, her not clearing this misconception up) dragged on for too long and was irksome.<br /><br />But Holy Christ On A Cracker, once the pacing picked up and the story finally began to unfold, KMM totally got her groove on. The fantasy part of this book was simply amazing. Winged Hunters flying through the sky, terrorizing Dublin, magical castles filled with mirrors, grotesque creatures sucking the life out of unsuspecting humans. Moning's imagery is captivating.<br /><br />But here's the thing. After the battles, the chases, the explosions, the decapitations....I was expecting one of two things: A) Love would save the day, or.....B) Mac would save the day. Turns out the Un-Seelie King saved the day. Huh. Didn't see that one coming. Karen Marie Moning managed to keep the story itself as the star of the show. The plot twists and turns, the mythology and fantasy, became the focus of the climax of this book. But neatly tucked into this rich and complex narrative, she included a couple of other things. A couple of things that will make every romance reader sigh with happiness.<br /><br />It didn't come with a big explosion or save-the-day plot device (like I thought it would). It was a simple, lovely, oh-so-satisfying declaration of love and trust.<br /><br />\\"He went very still. Is that how you think of me?<br /><br />Time seemed to stand still.....<br /><br />Bet your ass you're mine, bud, I shot at him...<br /><br />Barrons tossed his head back and laughed, teeth flashing in his dark face.\\"<br /><br />What we'd all been waiting for, for 5 long books. And finally, this....<br /><br />\\"I was happy. I knew why you'd lied.\\" His dark gaze was ancient, inhuman, and uncharacteristically gentle. Because you love me.....<br /><br />Barrons held out his hand. \\"Don't leave me Rainbow Girl.\\"....<br /><br />The best part of this book, for me--lover of romance above all else--wasn't the sifting Fae, the frozen concubines, the spear-stabbing kick-ass action scenes, the bellowing beast in the basement. The best part was the end of the journey for Mac. Things in Dublin are still weird, unfinished, and fraught with uncertainty. But finally, after her epic adventure, Mac knows that she earned the love and trust of her beast, and can trust in herself and the choices she has made.<br /><br />Simple, really.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />Penelope, Penelope's Romance Reviewsthe frozen concubines, the spear-stabbing kick-ass action scenes, the bellowing beast in the basement.

Even after receiving nominations for the Pulitzer, the National Book Award and other prestigious awards, for years I put my own writing mostly on hold while I made a living as a freelance editor---that is, I set aside working on my own short stories and novels in favor of editing other writers' short stories and novels---and a writing instructor. After reading Pressfield's book, which took all of an afternoon, I was able to adjust my schedule. Now, regardless of what else is going on or what else is waiting on my desktop, I write every morning from 9 until I'm through, usually around 1 or 2. Then I edit.

If you're serious about learning Java and want to learn by programming, I recommend passing on this book.  If you want to read about Java and don't feel like actually practicing what you're reading, this book may be for you.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I bought this for my husband, who has watched the Rocky movies more times than I can count. He loved this boxed set, especially that it had the bonus extra DVD that isn't in some sets. I haven't heard one complaint as far as quality, etc. Me, I've never seen one Rocky movie so I can't speak to that part of it. All told, this was a great buy at a great price and made my husband happy.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010)<br /><br />There are professions where, while people claim to look on in horror, it is an accepted tradition that young girls are, for all intents and purposes, locked away and made slaves in service of their craft. Gymnastics is the classic, and most widely-publicized, example thanks to a few Eastern European tyrant coaches, but figure skating and ballet are two others that come to mind pretty readily. You have to wonder how much Andres Heinz (whose only previous credit is as director; he was responsible for the highly underrated 1998 film The Origin of the Species), who wrote both the original story upon which this film is based and co-wrote the screenplay adapted from it, was thinking of Bela Karolyi when creating the character of Tomas. Vincent Cassel, who plays Tomas, has said in interviews he was thinking Balanchine, natch, but IMDB reports the original script was theatrical, not ballet-based, so I'm giving Heinz a little more leeway in his influences. One way or the other, what we have here in Black Swan is a typical \\"girl coming out of her shell\\" script... but then, nothing is typical in the world of Darren Aronofsky. The word \\"visionary\\" is overused indeed when it comes to directors, but look at what Aronofsky and the stable he keeps close around him (most notably composer Clint Mansell, who once again turns in a top-notch score) have accomplished in the past ten years and tell me it doesn't apply. Where body-horror auteur David Cronenberg abandoned body horror when he moved onto his brilliant realist films of the past decade, Aronofsky has spent the same decade figuring out how to integrate Cronenberg's vision of body horror into realistic movies. (Think about Jared Leto's arm during the last half-hour of Requiem for a Dream.) Black Swan, with everything from its depictions of common ballet injuries to the infamous final scene of the trailer, is his fullest realization of Cronenberg's tradition yet. And yet no one could ever possibly mistake this for a David Cronenberg film; it is Darren Aronofsky through and through.<br /><br />Nina Sayers (The Professional's Natalie Portman, recently of The Other Boleyn Girl) is a ballet dancer. She's dedicated, but she hasn't garnered the respect that her mother (The Last Temptation of Christ's Barbara Hershey) thinks she deserves. Is she right? (Note that she says Nina is the company's most dedicated dancer, not their most talented.) We don't know, not really. I'm assuming you, like me, are not a ballet dancer yourself. One way or the other, though, Tomas (Cassel, recently of Cronenberg's Eastern Promises), the tyrannical head of the company, decides to cast Nina in the lead role in his new, \\"stripped down, real\\" production of Swan Lake over the girl he'd previously chosen, Veronica (the gorgeous Ksenia Solo, in her first big-screen role since 2003's The Republic of Love). We find out quickly enough that he has a number of reasons for this, very few of which seem to have to do with Nina's innate talent. In fact, he tells her on a number of occasions that while her icy control is perfect for the role of the white swan, there's not enough true passion in her to correctly dance the role of the evil-twin black swan. And thus, as I said at the beginning, the story of the girl coming out of her shell. She's helped along by Lilly (The Book of Eli's Mila Kunis), the troupe's newest member, as well as by Tomas' attempts at seduction and her finally deciding that her mother's stifling her. But as the pressure mounts, Nina finds herself moving farther and farther from the world of the stripped-down and the real...<br /><br />Fifteen year ago, Vincent Cassel--son of the great French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel--popped up in Mathieu Kassovitz' first film, La Haine, playing a wannabe gangster, racist, and all-around scummy guy. He was absolutely brilliant, and it was obvious that of the trio of leads from that movie, Cassel was going to be the one who would goon to at least indie stardom. (Hubert Kounde is doing a successful turn in French television these days, while Said Tagmoui has become a reliable character actor). Since then, Cassel has made some resounding successes (Sheitan, Eastern Promises) and some dismal failures (Derailed, anything with the word \\"Ocean's\\" in its title), but never has he owned a role the way he did Vinz... up to now. Tomas is slick where Vinz was rough, but the same snake writhes under the surface, and Vincent Cassel knows how to play that snake. Moreover, Cassel was about as perfect a choice for the role as one could get; he's sexy, but in that low-rent way that turns so well into disgusting-homeless-guy (viz. Sheitan). He's not a classy seducer, he's rough sex in smoke-filled bathrooms (viz. Irreversible, and I will leave you to decide whether that was a success or a failure). But Tomas is, in the small world of his ballet company, a rock star, and Nina sees none of that griminess both inherent in Tomas and that Cassel brings to the role. On the other side of the coin you have Lilly, for whom the term \\"low rent\\" could have been coined. She says \\"bad influence\\" from the moment you meet her, with those big black wings tattooed on her back, and you know that if Nina gets tangled up with her, things will not end well. But you also know that Nina, so desperate to get out from under her mother's thumb, is absolutely going to get tangled up with Lilly.<br /><br />What I'm telling you here, other than that if Vincent Cassel doesn't pick up a Best Actor nom a lot of people in the Academy should be dropped off moving buses, is that there's nothing here you haven't seen before, nothing you haven't read in a dozen Angela Carter fairy-tale retellings. Hell, nothing you don't know from Swan Lake, except that it would be quite a stretch of the imagination to cast either Tomas or Lilly in anything other than a shade of grey far deeper than that to which Nina's clothes have progressed by the end of the film. This movie doesn't deserve the slew of Oscars it should get because it's telling you an original story. It deserves them because of how Aronofsky is telling you that story, because of all the little touches far more subtle than split toenails and tattoos of black wings. Because, according to IMDB, Aronofsky was actively pitting Portman and Kunis against one another backstage to heighten tension on the set. Because the physical-therapy scene was real (Portman dislocated a rib onset). Because everyone in this movie nails their roles (and did I neglect to mention Winona Ryder as the bitter drunk ex-principal, and all the glorious meta under the hood there?). Because even though you have to know what's coming on some level, especially after that last scene in the hospital where Aronofsky comes so dangerously close to overplaying his hand, that last scene in the dressing room still comes as enough of a surprise that you realize that, as in all the best films of this type, you were hoping Aronofsky would cheat and hand you a different climax, even though that would have made this not nearly as good a film as it is. (And come on, did you really expect the guy who gave you Jennifer Connelly cuddling with a bag of heroin, blissful expression on her face, at the end of Requiem for a Dream--and the dirty, disgusting, utterly sexy scene before it--to pull a single punch anywhere in this film? It is testament to the greatness of Darren Aronofsky that I most certainly did.) Because of the delicious little details. (\\"What happened?\\" \\"[sigh] I have a life. You work too hard.\\") Because Black Swan is the best thing I've seen on the big screen in first run since El Laberinto del Fauno four years ago, and the best film I've seen in any format from 2010 (to be fair, as of this writing, I haven't yet seen the two films that word on the street says may beat it for the Oscar, The King's Speech and Blue Valentine, nor have I seen Poetry). Because Darren Aronofsky did what I didn't think he could: he made a better film than Requiem for a Dream. It is not a perfect film, but it's as close to it as America has seen in ten years. It is beautiful and brutal and deeply, deeply affecting, and you must see it. **** ½e slew of Oscars it should get because it's telling you an original story.

B004DK49DW|5.0|I just want to say that I think this is the best cd by Social Distortiion.I am glad that it's a little change for them..Check it out...Excellent
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Pay very careful attention when trying to determine which disc you actually received from Amazon. There's conflicting information on the internet as far as the telltale signs of the remastered disc versus the original crappy transfer. For example, most people tell you the packaging for the new version has a yellow UPC....not always true. Other people tell you the copyright on the back bottom right of the box says 2010 DW Studios LLC instead of the original which says 2009, also not always true.<br />It seems the only definitive way to tell if you have the new version is to look at the innermost rings on the underside of Disc One itself. Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see \\"B1R2\\". If you have anything else (i.e. B1R1), you have the original version and NOT the remastered one!<br />If so, exchange it promptly.
1416596097|1.0|Arguably his most depressing effort yet. Hasn't Le Carre ever heard of a happy ending?    The book gets off to a sluggish start, livens up in the middle, even builds a little expectation towards the end, but then collapses like a pack of cards.
1595141715|4.0|Jay Asher, Thirteen Reasons Why (Razorbill, 2007)<br /><br />I tend to take a full whack of books out of the library at a time (my particular library allows for fifty, and between you, me, and the fencepost, they've bent that rule for me a time or two). While this offers me a plethora of reading choices when I finish up two or three books, the obvious downside is that every once in a while something gets shifted to the bottom of a pile and you forget you have it out until you're out of renewals (my library allows twenty, at three weeks at a time, unless someone else puts it on hold; and yes, I have, in fact, run that entire time out. Twice in the past year, even.). Which is exactly what happened when I pulled Thirteen Reasons Why out oh so long ago; I forgot it was there until I was renewing stuff last Thursday and the little \\"ON HOLD\\" tag popped up next to this one. Usually I just ship those back unread and put them back on the next-batch-of-holds list, but for some reason I decided I'd try and blow through this one over the weekend. I'm writing this on Wednesday morning and the book is sitting in the back of the car waiting to be returned, so you can tell how well that went...but that is entirely a function of my not having much free time at all rather than a function of the book, which is the first novel I've read in 2011 that's guaranteed to make my Best Reads of the Year list when we come around to December. By the time I'd gotten to the second chapter, I was willing to follow anywhere Jay Asher was going to lead.<br /><br />The story revolves around Clay Jenkins and Hannah Baker, students at the same high school. Two weeks before the story begins, Hannah Baker committed suicide. The day before the story opens, Clay comes home from school to find a plain-brown-wrapped package addressed to him on the front stoop. When he opens it, it contains seven cassettes which, it turns out, were recorded by Hannah in the days leading up to her death. Thirteen sides of the tapes are full, each one detailing the reasons why one specific person in town is to blame for Hannah's death. Clay starts out listening to the tapes out of a sense of obligation--Hannah has built a fail-safe into things to make sure those who are supposed to listen to the tapes actually do--but as time goes on and Clay gets deeper into Hannah's story, he starts to understand how, as Hannah says, everything affects everything.<br /><br />The bad part here is that the book is manipulative. Nakedly, greedily manipulative, and if you stop to think about it for five minutes, that will come to you. There are small, but pivotal, decisions made by those in the book (most of these decisions we never see, but that they were made is implicated in Clay having received the tapes in the first place) that would almost certainly have gone the opposite way in real life. (By this I mean: no one would have actually been scared off by Hannah's fail-safe, because [a] people act out of their own self-interest, and thus the idea of ruining the lives of those on the tapes whose crimes were really serious, in a legal sense, would have no bearing on their decisions, and [b] a lot of people, upon hearing these tapes, would listen to them and still believe that their actions were, in fact, not a big deal. Thus, why would they follow Hannah's instructions?) The good part, on the other hand, is that this book achieves something that happens rarely at best for me: I knew I was being manipulated and I didn't care. Why? Because the journey that Asher takes us on is inherently interesting, and presented in a way that makes it even more so, for one thing. For another, Asher is a very good writer, and he's capable of taking these interesting ideas and their interesting delivery system and presenting them in a way that makes the reader keep wanting to turn the pages. (Yes, there is a difference between \\"interesting\\" and \\"good\\". The first book that pops into my head that really illustrates that difference in a striking way is Lorne Dixon's The Lifeless, which has an extremely interesting premise and delivery system and bad writing. Read, compare, contrast.)<br /><br />Excellent. I'm just sorry it took me so long to get round to reading it when it's been sitting in the living room waiting for me for months. ****Lorne Dixon's The Lifeless, which has an extremely interesting premise and delivery system and bad writing.

B004DK49DW|4.0|Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes, the latest offering from Social Distortion, offers some new twists to the band's sound and approach.  It opens with an instrumental, \\"Road Zombie.\\"  While it's odd hearing a Social D song without the vocals of front man Mike Ness, it's a great opener, with just the right touch of drive and menace.  Female background vocals grace the next track, \\"California (Hustle and Flow)\\" as well as a tune further along on the disc, \\"Can't Take it With You.\\"  In my opinion, this move works, lending the songs a spirit and feel very similar to Exile-era Stones without sounding imitative.    The most notable change to the band's sound is that the majority of songs on this album are mid-tempo and missing the guitar rage and storm of past albums.  Many fans will no doubt be dismayed by this.  I'll admit that I was not expecting it; however, many of the songs are high quality and worthy of repeated listening.  There are many highlights for me on this album, including \\"Far Side of Nowhere,\\" as perfect a mid-tempo rock song as has ever been written.  \\"Alone and Forsaken,\\" written by Hank Williams, Sr., is a fine addition to the list of stellar cover versions Social D has done, including \\"Backstreet Girl,\\" \\"Ring of Fire,\\" \\"Making Believe,\\" and \\"Under My Thumb.\\"  I'm also quite fond of the ballad \\"Bakersfield,\\" with a fantastic and humorous (intentionally or not) spoken ending.    Yes, there are some weak tracks and lyrical moments.  \\"California,\\" while not a bad song, is not very distinctive; it could have been written by anybody, with lines like \\"Everyone's got some sorta ball and chain/What's life without a little pain?\\"  True enough, but rather obvious, too.  The closing track, \\"Still Alive,\\" with references to making \\"my stand/with a guitar in my hand\\" is also a bit weak lyrically, but the music is strong.    This is actually a strength of the entire disc: it is musically and melodically solid.  Mike Ness is in fine voice, and his guitar, while more restrained than in days past, still sounds great.  Social Distortion has never released a bad album; Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is no exception.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Sabatoge will always have a special meaning for me as it was the first Sabbath album I bought.  Being 15 years old when it came out in 1975 I was just getting into Heavy Metal and Hard Rock.  My sister's boyfriend recommend to me that I get this album.  I knew Sabbath vaguely from Iron Man and Paranoid, but that was it.  The first time I put this record on and listen to it I became a huge Sabbath fan.  \\"Hole in the Sky\\" is still one of the all time greats.  And the rest of the album has no filler.  Just great heavy metal and even a short acoustic break by Iommi which is tremendous.  I would highly recommend this CD to any and all Sabbath and heavy metal fans.

0316743003|5.0|This book is simply amazing.  I couldn't put it down as soon as i started reading.  I love reading about the military and top secret projects, and i'm an engineer, and a pilot, so this book was right up my alley.  I want to work for Skunk Works! its a little confusing how the book is set up.  It's not chronological, but rather by project.  So first it talks about the F-117, then the U-2, then the SR-71, etc.  A little confusing since it went from the 70's, to the 50's... but you figure it out quick.  This book really is great for anyone who has an interest in aviation, engineering, or history.  It has a lot of sections called \\"other voices\\" that show excerpts from high ranking military officials, CIA directors, test pilots, etc, and it gives you a great insight and a different perspective on what Ben Rich was just talking about.  Couldn't put the book down.

I recommend anyone intereseted in running whether you are a beginner or have been running for years, read  Chi running and try it. You will be  surprised at how different it feels and how much it really helps you run injury free. It feels so good to run without gettting those injuries. It makes running so much more fun!

B000BZISTE|4.0|M*A*S*H has always been one of my favorite films since I saw it while in Vietnam. On the surface it is about the Korean War and can be generalized as an anit-war film, but it is really an anti-Vietnam War film that heaps distain on the rigid tunnel vision of the establishment and the seemingly mindless attitudes and actions of the military.     The director's discussion is also interesting and reveals some insights into the production and politics of the making of the film

Some questions answered in the way I expected, but also was surprised in some parts.  Loved how everyone had to strip before entering Chesters so they would know they weren't carrying the book!  Loved how Mac stood up for herself in Chesters against Barrons men.  Surprised that Darroc died so soon in the book, expected him to be the villain to the end.  Loved seeing the Keltars and Adam.  That was so cool  And when they all went out together killing unseelie.  That was great.  Got to see some real teamwork there even though the Keltars and Barrons Men and V'lane were always arguing.

0439023513|4.0|Those who are fans of the Hunger Games series were probably eagerly awaiting the final installment of the trilogy, Mockingjay, this past August. I myself was in this group, and only had to worry about how I would fit in reading the book around the birth of my son!    Unfortunately, I don't think the final book lived up to its billing.    Mockingjay picks up where Catching Fire left off. Katniss has been rescued from the arena, and the revolution has begun. The book follows Katniss as she plays the public role of the Mockingjay, the figurehead of the rebellion.    This book is dark, even darker than the previous two books (which is saying something). Without following the combat of the larger war, it still fits in tons of carnage as we follow Katniss around. Nothing and no one is sacred or safe in this book, and life in the heart of the rebellion is not much better than life in Panem.    What I like about Mockingjay, and really the entire series, is that it vividly illustrates the dangerous nature of power. Even those in the rebellion aren't immune to its allure, and fall prey to some of the same atrocities commited by the Capital in previous books. The novel paints evil as a wave that must constantly be kept at bay, not as something that can ever be completely eradicated. In this way, it's practically a tract for libertarianism.    My knock on the book is that it ends without any final message of hope. Without spoiling too much, even a win in the end is empty. Does this reflect reality? I don't know. But I like a little hope for our world, at least in my fiction.
B000002KDS|5.0|Obviously to build on the momentum of their earlier release, Cooper put out their second collaboration with Bob Ezrin in late 1971, dubbed `Killer', within the same year. And momentum was skyrocketing as the latter album proved to be even more successful than the groundbreaking `Love It to Death'. Alice Cooper was now become a national name much to the consternation and anguish of parents and elders across the USA. If you have such a non subtlety as `Killer' for a title than your LP cover has to be equally as provocative and obscene (check!) but if the music isn't `killer' than what are you left with? For Alice Cooper, the music laid to waste the notion that this band of Satan mongers and degenerates (according to Middle America) would fade into the grime. The songs were the band's strongest to date and the stage would continue to thrill thousands of teens and appall their parents.  \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Be My Lover\\" soon joined the ranks of \\"I'm Eighteen\\" as all-time rock classics and as a one-two punch opener, a long haired rock n' roll band couldn't do much better. \\"Halo of Flies\\" is an amazing progressive epic and \\"Dead Babies\\" was as meaningful from a PSA standpoint as the controversy from its inclusion in the show where its message of anti-child abuse was loss in the busted up baby dolls.  I really love both \\"Desperado\\" and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" and the title track is just beyond weird.  `Killer' could be my favorite Cooper record and it righteously continued Alice's winning streak. It would only get bigger from here on in...
0375846735|4.0|In the final and lengthier conclusion to the trilogy, the full realization of this story is brought to light to such an extent that everything now becomes symbolic in some way, literature quotes begin each chapter, and the depth and complexity of the novel passes far beyond any childhood or young adult fantasy, presenting a complicated plot and moral for even adults to handle.  It is in this final book that the strengths and beliefs of our heroes will be tested to their extent, while our own beliefs will be in danger, when the basis for all religion and faith in all worlds is brought into question and threatened.

0743244257|1.0|This is my second attempt with Don DeLillo, the first being last year's The Body Artist, and having read Cosmopolis, I still don't know what all the fuss is about this guy.  Maybe it's an \\"East Coaster\\" thing, for the guy just doesn't impress me much.  He's the kind of author who attempts to use long words, complex run-on sentence, and go off on long and boring tangents which really have no bearing on the novel, and any real meaning or truth to offer the reader.    Cosmopolis is about a really rich guy who decided that he doesn't want to have his barber come to his skyscraper with his huge office to cut his hair.  Instead he's going to take the limo across New York to have the barber cut his hair at his shop.  As Mr. Rich attempts to cross town, the president is at the same time coming through with his vast motorcade, and has his life threatened by an assassin.  So traffic essentially slows to a complete crawl, while Mr. Rich comfortably travels in his limo.    Along the way, for some reason (probably because he's that rich!), he gets out of the car and meets people he knows, has sex with wives, ex-wives, and \\"little bits on the side\\" in their car and their apartment, and all this stuff happens while he is trying to get to the barber shop; essentially about a rich guy using his riches.    So if you would like to read about what it would be like to be so rich that you can get and do absolutely anything you want, read Cosmopolis, and get lost in long sentences that lead you into endless cul-de-sacs.

B000TGCR4C|5.0|If you believed Paul Verhoeven did only \\"Basic Instinct\\" (a success for Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas) and \\"Total Recall\\" (where Arnold Schwartzenegger offers a better performance), consider \\"Black Book\\", based on real events, as the director details in his own interesting commentary accompanying the DVD and Blu-ray.    Real life individuals are not just good or bad, as Dickens used to depicts his characters.  In this film we see that, by and large, the Dutch people protected Jews during the war, because, almost all along their history, they rightly believed (as Shylock, the complex character of Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" points out in his famous monologue) that Jews were in no way different (better or worst) than other people.  They were their equals.   While some of the Dutch people did fight against the Nazi occupiers, others collaborated with them, and there were also those who where indifferent.   Germans are also not shown in black and white.   Most of the Nazi commanding officers believed in Hitler's ideology that Germans was superior to others and, therefore, are destined to win, but not all of them where sadistic, eager to kill no matter what.  There are even characters who start doing good, then turn evil, and vice-versa, opportunists ... as it usually happens in real life.    Maybe, the story is not perfectly written for the screen, but, nonetheless it is quite realistic.   The film is \\"courageous\\" because it attempts to tell the truth.   Complicated as it is, but, nonetheless, the truth.  \\"Black Book\\" is, perhaps Verhoeven's greatest film shot after his return from Hollywood.
B0046HAKMQ|4.0|Even though rising-to-fame author Neil Gaiman won the American Library Association's Alex Award as one of 2000's top ten adult novels for young adults for the novel Stardust, it has still been a while since Gaiman addressed the young adult's literature corner, still riding on the success of his recent tome, American Gods.  But it is clear with Coraline that Gaiman can still chill your bones whether you're a kid or an adult.    Coraline is the main character in the wonderful but scary novel about her life with her strange family in her strange apartment with some very strange neighbors.  You see, there is a door in this apartment which leads to the apartment next door, but it is locked and blocked off by a brick wall.  One day Coraline decides to take a look at what's on the other side of that door and finds the wall gone, with an open space in its place.  Moving inside she finds a mirror image of the apartment she lives, as well as her parents there, only they are not her real parents.    Upon returning to her own apartment, she finds that her parents have gone missing, and she ventures back into the other apartment knowing that her fake parents have kidnapped her real parents, and it is up to her to save them.  She also finds a couple of friends in the other apartment who have been in this crazy world for a very long time.  In this world her fake mother is in control, ad she's quite evil.  It is up to Coraline to stop her fake mother somehow, rescue her real parents, as well as her new friends.    In this wonderful novel that is part horror, part mystery, part thriller, and mostly a great kid's story, the creator of the Sandman series brings us into some of the darkest dreams that children can have, and it is up to Gaiman to leads us through the right door.

0140620516|5.0|Before buying the book, I knew but a bit of the true story of Jekyll and Hyde.  The book will drive you higher and higher as you read it, since the story is told from  a strange, but nonetheless interesting point of view, it's almost as if you were there, you know, back then. In London.    Yes. This isn't a joke, the story fits in less than one hundred of pages.   For those who know the story in brief, but not the whole story as it is written in the book (as I did, actually), you  won't be disappointed if you buy it. 'Tis a masterpiece, that one won't easily find an equivalent nowadays.  Surprising turning of events for an amazing story... what else does one need?  So huge a story, for so simple a book.
0439023513|4.0|In the long, impatiently awaited conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay does the job to everyone's satisfaction, but still leaves readers wondering why everything had to get wrapped up so quickly and completely in one book, when longer series are more popular; it must've been something Collins had decided from the start and stuck with right up to the end.    The resistance is ready to take the dictatorial government of the Capitol down.  The supreme and primary hideout is the destroyed waste of District 13, where an elaborate system of dormitories, living spaces, training rooms and compounds, mess halls, and command centers exists beneath the ground.  Katniss is to be the spokesperson and figurehead for the resistance - the Mockingjay.  At first Katniss doesn't know if she's ready or even able to do this, after everything she's gone through.  Gale is training with her, while Peeta remains a captive of the Capitol.  Then she comes to a decision after a shocking experience; she will be the Mockingjay.  The resistance begins a series advertising campaigns, as they attempt to convert all the districts against the government.  Katniss is front and center in most of them, visiting those in need and rescuing and helping who she can.  Once all districts are united against the Capitol, the final showdown will happen.    Collins continues with the magic in her writing from the first two books, getting readers hooked in from the first page, and then shutting themselves out of their own lives until they get to the end.  Collins covers a monumental amount changes, events and happenings in Mockingjay, leaving this reader wondering why this last book didn't get expanded into two or three, giving her characters more room to develop and change with the events taking place; as a result Mockingjay feels a little rushed at times.  Nevertheless, it is a satisfying conclusion to the series, and fans will be wondering what Collins will be dishing up next, while other writers jump on the \\"teens in a post-apocalyptic setting\\" band wagon to try to cash in on the Hunger Games success.

B0020BUWX2|3.0|This book has so much potential to be an amazing book, however I feel like it just fell a bit short. The storyline is a great one and could have been a real tear-jerker, but for some reason I just didn't feel a whole lot of emotion. The very end of the book is where I finally started to feel the deeper emotion that I would have liked to understand a little better throughout the book.<br /><br />maybe I'm just not getting the concept, maybe there is purposely little emotion because Mia (main character) is half way between life and death and feels very little. The best way I can describe it is that she has detached feelings from the real world because she is only hanging on by a thread and set on letting go. The moment you start to feel her emotions is the moment she comes back to her body. I guess I get that, but it just kind of left me feeling like I really didn't care all that much for the first half of the book.<br /><br />I was partly annoyed about how much space was used in between each spoken sentence between characters, I felt like it made the book seem so much more to it then what was really there, I think that alone partially skewed my opinion of this book.<br /><br />For whatever reason this book just didn't have that little special something that made me say wow I love this book. It was not bad but not great. I can understand why other people did enjoy it however, I guess I expected it to be better then what it was.
B002JCSRKC|2.0|The toes are very wide and make the boots appear giant. I have a skinny frame and my calves are not large at all, but, for some reason, the curvature of the shaft does not fit my calves and rubs against it when I walk. Not the best fit for me, though they very light.
0385341679|5.0|OMG..!! What a book! This is definitely Karen Moning's best work yet, ever. I didn't know she has so many tricks up her sleeves. These books were the only series that I've followed faithfully and impatiently for the last 5 years and it's because she didn't disappoint.     Where can I start? The first chapter reveales immediately the nagging question to last book's cliff hanger. But that's the only hunch that I got right in the book, everything else was dead wrong! Mac really annoyed me at times due to her indecision (perhaps because of her fear) for her feelings for Barrons and that's the only flaw I could think of about the book: that it took to darn long for Mac to come around and reveal the truth that was in her heart for so long. But even so, I understood why it took so long for her to do it.     All I can say is it's worth the wait. It really is!    Thanks, Karen for such wonderful books. I can't wait for the next series.
B00447G29S|2.0|3d affects were very few and not up to par of the newer three D movies on DVD.  Was very disappointed.
0439023513|5.0|Major spoilers follow:<br /><br />I've read many of the reviews, good and bad. I can't say I loved this story, who can love a story that is so filled with tragedy? What I can say is that it was very moving and the most compelling book I've read on the realities of war.<br /><br />War changes people, it devastates people, and to say that Katniss should be able to be strong and move on unaffected is not realistic. How can a compassionate human being not be affected by the lives they took and having loved ones tortured and killed senselessly?<br /><br />Was this war worth it to the people? Personally I believe it was. There are things worth fighting for. The lesson to be learned by this story is that we should never forget the price that war brings. It is paid for with the lives of real people, the ones that die and the survivors all pay a price. In my opinion, what affected Katniss the most was seeing friends and many rebels become a reflection of their enemies. Inhumane acts against them did not justify committing those same acts in return. Katniss' eyes were truly opened when she realized that President Coin who was replacing the heartless President Snow, was no better than he was. It was a great act of courage when she killed the rebel's President Coin and then expected her own life to end as a result. It's sad that the people didn't understand her motives. Nor was she emotionally able to articulate them. Thankfully they deemed her emotionally unbalanced and let her return to district 12 to live out the rest of her life.<br /><br />I think the book ends in the best way possible given the circumstances. I am glad the author didn't sugar coat the realities of war, but reminded each of us that war is hell. My hope for Katniss is that she will be able to glean as much happiness in her life, with the man she choose and later, the children she reluctantly brings into a world that so terrifies her, regardless of the peace the country sees after the war. Maybe we should all be terrified, or at least not take our own peace and happiness for granted, knowing that history has taught us that we human beings have the capacity to be extremely cruel.not take our own peace and happiness for granted, knowing that history has taught us that we human beings have the capacity to be extremely cruel.

B000002GJ7|3.0|'Pornograffiti' is Extreme's second album and is often called 'Extreme II'. The songwriting is considerably more advanced that their first album from two years earlier, in terms of material and songwriting, etc. Perhaps they were able ot put out a high-quality polished album so early in their career because all the four members of the band had been essentially playing in bands for a fairly long time until now.    'Pornograffiti' is a well-realised and well-produced album, but it strikes me that their songwriting is very limited. They have mixed ballads in amongst the rock songs, as well as snippets of different styles grafted onto the front of some songs (e.g. piano at the start of 'Decadence Dance') to try and give an impression of diverstiy, but there are still at least nine rock songs that all sound fairly similar.    Extreme's sound is 'funky'hair-metal, and they do know how to rock, very well, I might say. Their lyrics are sometimes insightful and often witty. Lead singer Gary Cherone has a great growl/scream that suits this style of music, and Nuno Bettencourt is one of the best guitarists going around. The rhythm section is handy and professional too.     The best tracks are the title track, which has a supremely catchy chorus and great lyrics about how sex is overplayed in our society, the humourous 'When I'm President', and 'Decadence Dance' is a ball of fun, too. Most of the other \\"rockers\\" are basically continuations of these three songs, the intro to 'He man woman hater' is fantastic though. I love the ballad 'More than words', heartfelt, and excellent melody. So there are some fine moments on this album, and most of the songs sound good on their own terms, but when they are all bunched together like this it becomes a slight case of overload - but Extreme are a good band and their energy, enthusiasm and ability to rock will please the rock music fan.
0679809015|4.0|This is about the size of your palm so it is really small, which makes the flaps inside each page even smaller -- sort of reminds me of the books you can get at the dollar store... I realize we're in the decade where everything is fashionably smaller so are we making smaller books too? Even my fingers had a hard time opening some of the flaps. Good thing daddy knows how to make animal sound effects when he reads this to our 11 month old so she smiles & squeals! Love the brightly colored pictures and when my baby is an older toddler, I think she'll have fun with this guessing game: \\"Who says moo? A cow.\\" Book also features pig, chick, pony, ducklings, goat, dog, cats, rooster, and owl.
1401323952|3.0|The book appeals to me in many ways.  As a person, I adore Nigella. She is smart with a wonderful sense of humor-and humility. However, I made the walnut coffee layer cake and both my husband and I found the frosting cloyingly sweet, and after trying to remove the frosting and eat the cake (naked) it just has no redeeming qualities. No salt? All baked goods should have at least a pinch of salt to bring out the flavors. The rest of the book seems just mediocre, don't know if I am willing to risk the time or ingredients...
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is wonderful! Rick Riordan has struck again with this brilliant contribution. Some people say this book is disappointing, but don't believe them! I highly recommend buying this book. This writer speaks clearly, and the characters are fully developed. While waiting for the second installment in the series, you can read The Red Pyramid. I understand Riordan has these two series balanced so that in the spring, the second Kane Chronicles will come out and in the fall, Heroes of Olympus Number Two hits stores. Buy this book!!!!
B003EI2EH2|1.0|Simply horrible! No real information only a re-cap of basic information that is already available in better publications and in more detail.  Looks like a child wrote it.

030746363X|5.0|Me and my wife got this book 4 weeks ago. I started the \\"Lose 28 lbs in 30 days\\" as well as the triple your testosterone and sperm cound sections. In the last 2 weeks I have lost 9 lbs an 1 full inch off my waist. The food tastes wonderful and the diet is easy to stick with cause you are only on in for a week... then another week... so you don't notice. My Testosterone went from 300 to 402 in those 2 weeks and is climbing. The 15 minute female orgasim is insane!!!! my wife whom has never had an orgasim in her 30 year life is in love with this section. This book is so cheap but is filled with quite literaly life altering items... I now am losing weight like a fiend... lifting more.. running faster... getting my wife off and sleeping less while being less tired... ummmm where is the downside!
B00008EY5W|5.0|Personally I liked the movie but I caught on to things that my friends didnt.  For example the Nazi references woven throughout the film.  Now as far as the dvd, the regular dvd is ok but the superbit is a necessary improvement.  For those who like this film check out his director's cut of Robocop, that is the x-rated version.
0385341679|5.0|Shadowfever the last in the series was everything I ever wanted and more. IT WAS AMAZING! The Book picks off directly where we left off in the last book with Mac in a state of extreme grief when her protector beast dies. You find out who that beast was right away, but I'm not going to give it away. I'm going to give the vaguest overview of the book because I really don't want to spoil anything. Mac then sets off on a journey to get the book at whatever cost so that she can make a new world where everything will be perfect for her. Loves one will still be there, and people she loves can have a better life.    One of the big questions that was raised in this book was what is Mac. She is not like all the other sidhe-seers, and now others are telling her the woman she thought was her mother Isla actually only had one daughter Alina. No one knows where Mac came from and she's starting to get a sneaking suspicion she might not be entirely good. There was lots of decisions for Mac to make in this book, she finally finds out who killed her sister but it isn't entirely a black and white situation. She wants to find the book to help those she loves but with quite a few prophecies over her head saying that she might destroy the world she is fearful of trying.    My favorite part of the book though was when we learned more about Barron's and the men he is with. We finally get the long awaited answers to them, though there are still some things I would like to know. Especially about his men they are all so different and they will not hesitate to kill Mac when everything is over because she knows too much. We also get a conclusion to the love triangle, I loved who was chosen and how it happened it was everything I had waited for. I absolutely loved this book it was an amazing finale to a series, and brought almost everything to a great ending. But who knows maybe one day we will get more of Mac which I would love because the end of the book says the end...for now!
B004FLIXVS|4.0|I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since the early days.  I have bought their live cds back when every concert they did seemed to be available.  The song selection for Live on Ten Legs is a great representation of their entire catalog and it was nice to see the Public Image Lmtd. cover.<br /><br />I went back and relistend to Live on Two Legs and the newer album just does not seem as raw and emotional as previous Pearl Jam material.  I suppose that is only normal as the band has been around for over 20 years and played on tour for the entire time.  With that being said this is still a must have album.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I'd never read a health book which starts out by describing being backstage at a NIN concert.<br /><br />I knew I was in for a wild ride.<br /><br />In the 4-Hour Body, Tim Ferriss chronicles his eclectic experiences at hacking his body: weight loss & muscle gain, perfect abs and perfect baseball swing, tripling his testosterone, holding his breath for three minutes, & more.<br /><br />As a family physician, I can tell you that most of his material is not that revolutionary: his diet is just a simple variant of a low glycemic load diet, and many trainers will tell you that kettle bells rock as an exercise. But Tim is a showman at heart, as well as probably being just a little bit crazy, and this book reflects his devil-may-care take-life-by-the-throat until it screams for mercy approach to living.  The book is intentionally designed to give you a potpouri of ideas and projects to pick from, and he encourages you to find something that you want to change about your body and go for it.<br /><br />Even if you don't implement a single thing in this book, you'll have a barrel of fun reading it.  And most everyone will find at least one chapter that they will find intruiging enough to implement his concepts to try on their own. He's motivated me to get back to my ideal weight, and I'm already half way there by implementing some of his regimen. Best health book of the year.
0385341679|5.0|Short and Sweet with no spoilers...  This book is by far my favorite in a series that is by far the best (in my opinion) series in Urban Fantasy.  My favorite aspect of this book (that does not give away the plot) is that the characters are all speculating on what they think they are and what they think others are.  They are doing with each other what we, the reader, do with all of them. They are scratching their heads and trying to put together the pieces to answer that one burning question, \\"What are you?\\" with each drawing their own conclusions that may or may not be on the point.  All of this speculation builds into one very surprising, very oracle like incident involving one of the characters that was amazingly well laid and played...  I will read this book again and again, hoping to glean all of the subtle nuances that are like trickles that become rivers... It is all there and has been since the beginning.
B000TENKV8|4.0|Great hazy rainy day album. I actually just wanted to say that I noticed that the MP3 download on Amazon has a different version of Bells Ring than I have on a CD I own from the mid 90s. The version here has distortion guitar and the one I have listened to for years is acoustic and slower than this version. Both sound good, but I think that I like the one on my CD better. I am not sure when this changed, or if there are other songs that have different download versions. Can anyone shed some light on this?
1594202842|5.0|This book is a wonderful read - especially for immigrant parents and children of immigrant parents. I am not sure other people can really appreciate this book. My own parents were immigrants and I found the book to be therapeutic since many of the controversial tactics that she used were also used by my parents. I remember people saying that my parents tactics were \\" abusive \\" but I never felt abused. I knew it was just the way my parents were and they wanted me to be tough and to be ready for life. And they did do that. I didnt always like my parents but they did make me stronger. It also helped me with the push and pull that I feel between the two cultures raising my own daughter.     One of the best reads in a long time.
1441761268|5.0|The Kitchen House is an unforgettable story that speaks to everyone.  Set in the 1790's and early 1800's, it is a coming-of-age story,  and Grissom raises such pivotal questions as: What truly makes a family? How can people restricted by social boundaries find ways to work together? and What is the true meaning of friendship?<br /><br />In 1791, Lavenia, a young Irish imigrant, is orphaned aboard ship as a result of her parents' illness.  Taken as an indentured servant by the ship's captain, she is sent to work in the \\"kitchen house\\" with the plantation slaves.  Lavenia soon learns to appreciate the refuge and is settled into her new home.  However, strict boundaries and cruelty surround the little girl as she comes to realize the predicament in her newfound home.  Loyalties will be tested and Lavenia will learn the cruel truth that certain boundaries are not to be crossed.  This book is so well written, and the plot is so skilfully woven that it is impossible to do it justice in a review.  Thee story is told mostly from Lavenia's perspective.  However, alternating chapters are told from the point of view of Bell, a young slave girl who takes Lavenia under her wing.  Bell's chapters are significantly shorter, but they are extremely engaging.  The striking difference between the two main characters makes the reading experience very enjoyable.<br /><br />The audio version of this book is read by two fantastic narrators.  Orlah Cassidy and Bahni Turpin read with clarity and emotion.  I would strongly urge everyone to give this unforgettable novel a chance.  Happy reading, and God bless you all.<br /><br />(Please look for my fantasy novel, Crimilia, which is scheduled to be released in April.  Thank you).

B0042JTDXK|3.0|I am a huge fan of Josh Grobans. I think Closer was nothing short of brilliant, and his other works have been incredible also. I was very excited for Illumination to come out.<br /><br />That being said, I have listened to it multiple times and I'm just not as impressed. This is the first disc that I find myself skipping around on. Some songs are great, but it just doesn't hold a candle to his other albums.<br /><br />It's still worth getting if you're a Grobanite, but new fans probably should invest in his other works.
B002L7TMAE|5.0|This fine boxset contains everything Hardy that released in the French language on Vogue during 1962-1966. As far as I've been able to find out all the singles and EP tracks from the period are included in addition to the five French albums plus the \\"English\\" \\"Francoise Hardy in English.\\" There are very fine melodic pop songs on all albums, and there is a timeless charm in Hardy's voice and her way to perform the songs, of which more than half were written by Hardy herself.<br /><br />It would take too much space to mention all the great songs, but I can not help but mention the two numbers which first opened my eyes to her qualities. The first was \\"Only Friends\\" (in French \\"Ton Meilleur Ami\\"), which I often heard when I as a child visited my mother's sister. Later, \\"La Maison ou jai grandi\\" was a big hit and was played regularly on Danish radio.<br /><br />One can wonder why the two subsequent Vogue albums from 1967 and 1968 are not included - it would have been both logical and appropriate. Unfortunately, they have been omitted, but fortunately they can be found as individual releases. Some of the later Vogue singles, may probably be more difficult to find.  Songs in other languages such as German or Italian are not included.<br /><br />The sound is clear and fine, and not significantly changed compared to previous CD releases. There is a booklet containing the original sleeve-notes and other information from the period. You might have wished for more information about Hardy's career course and songs' origins, but still a great release, that should appeal to all Hardy fans.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|I've just put down Shadowfever and still have unanswered questions (but I must admit that I am more concerned with the Keltar Druids than anything else.  I reluctantly began reading this series because Ms. Moning was not writing anything else.  I am a devout fan of the Highlander series and was happy for the little glimpses she allowed of them throughout the Fever books.  Shadowfever did answer most of my questions by the end.  I think the slow revelations of Barron's and Mac's revelations were a bit convoluted but in the end they did make a weird sort of sense.  I have never been a fan of first person narrative and the author's penchant for jumping from Mac, to Dani was a bit off-putting (I really could care less about Dani's perspective would have loved to get Barron's or even Vlane's for that matter).  As a Moning fan who has purchased all of her books I felt a bit cheated towards the end. It was pretty clear that Shadowfever is staging for quite a few spin-off story lines and judging by the once-a-year release of her books I don't think my readers heart could take it.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Well what can I say that has not already been discussed? I think that Karen Monning has really outdone herself on the level of her writing and her twists and turns. All I can say is WOW and I stayed up to finish the book on my Kindle. It says a lot that there are so many posts already. DO NOT even be tempted to \\"cheat\\"and read the end first as it will make no sense what-so-ever! Finally there are answers to many questions but not tied up in a nice neat package. There are some annoying parts with Dani that get on your \\"freking\\" nerves. This series is a departure for Ms. Moning and not the fun Highlander romance of her other books. I do like the running theme but think that our other Keltars were sort of thrown in there and not really a part of the story as they could have been as the book began to get too long.  My criticisms have already been pointed out by others. The series was dragged out waaay too long and the first four books ought to have been consolidated into maybe three. But this is the author's series and she can do whatever she wants, just noting that it was a bit tedious and hard to follow with the level of complexity involved and the down time between each novel.  This series is not a romance series but really about humanity, loss of humanity, regaining humanity, hope, loss of hope, regaining hope and so much more. Get ready to read it fast then go back and savor the next one or two times!

B002ZG98C8|4.0|Danny Trejo as a leading man? it works in this one, Trejo is \\"Machete\\". Desperado director Robert Rodriquez revives this film from a sample trailer on his \\"Planet Terror\\" dvd shown in the extras. The bottom line...this was intended and meant to be a cult film, blood, gore, nudity...lots of t & a, and loaded with non-stop action...how many cult films do you know of really received high ratings in cinema history...low percentage, the concept of Machete makes this film a winner, Rodriquez was never looking for an Academy award. There's also no denying a political statement throughout, this is the plot with an all-star cast, Robert De Niro, Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson...Machete is a matter of taste, it's not for everyone. The dvd format is 16x9 widescreen, the extras include deleted scenes.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Maybe I'm greedy, but I would have given this absorbing book five stars, had the ending been as meaty as the beginning.  I would have liked more about Piper's re-entry into non-prison society, as well as info, if available, about women she grew close to who were left behind.<br /><br />Impressions: Her quick intelligence allowed her to form solid survival strategies; an unusually large number of friends and family provided comfort and she had the ability to emotionally distance herself from some of the chaos. In places that distance came through sufficiently for me to wonder if she had been that adept at walling off anguish, or if the writing didn't portray it.  Maybe both.
B000002QWD|5.0|Thanks Everyone at Amazon!! Once again you came through with flying colors! This is why I come back...my album got here on time, and I was able to enjoy my favorite Christmas album on Christmas!! Thanks again!!
B003L20IFQ|5.0|An American truck driver working in Iraq finds himself buried alive in a coffin. Armed only with a few items such as a cell phone and a lighter, he is able to communicate with government officials in an attempt to free himself from this predicament. Taking place entirely within the confines of the coffin, this is a riveting tale of claustrophobia and the terror of realizing the possibility of dying alone within a confined space. His fate will not be revealed here, so as not to spoil a film that is exciting until the very end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I am going to cheat a little bit and just say a few words about all 3 books because you can't possibly pick up this book and read it without reading the other 2 first. I am primarily a sci fi reader who could not resist reading the trilogy with all the good reviews. I was surprized to find myself engrosed and intrigued after reading the first 1k bytes or so. The books are all real button pushers. Ok, ok, so you guessed that I am a kindle reader! The stories have a cast of dozens but primarily follow the explotes of two main characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. I would guess that Mikael is the alter ego of the auther, Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />Set is sweden, where the author lived, these three extremely exciting novels follow the exploits of Salander and Bloomkist as they try to solve the mystery of the missing 16 year old in the first novel and in the second and third novels their attention is turned to the mystery of three murders. Don't get me wrong, lots more happens but I'm not telling except to say that Blomkvist writes a lot and sleeps his way through a bevy of girl friends. Salander grows up from frightened, abused little girl to brilliant, be it slightly nuerotic, adult with the world at her keyboard. Read these books, you won't be disappointed!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|The story of one of the most electrfying horses to win the triple crow. A housewife whose mother just passed and her father's mental abilities are deteriorating, she must try to save the family's horse farm. A young colt is born to one of her mares; the colt grows into the best race horse in history. The film successfully portrays the efforts of a woman attempting to preserve her family's legacy while at the same time, fulfill her duties as a housewife and mother in 1970's America. The race scenes are particularly riveting, as the photography puts the viewer right in the action.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|This is a truly incredible production with no stone left unturned in terms of quality and originality. Be prepared for extreme violence (not excessive, simply real) and full frontal nudity. Neither of these two items are to my personal taste; I definitely prefer them left out. However, they don't diminish my opinion. A very excellent series if ever there was one, but I can't stomach all the gore and sex. Perhaps you'll be fine with it. I'll buy the series and simply fast forward through the most shocking scenes, of which they abound.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|A young family is being frightened in their home by spirits in this prequel to Paranormal Activity, one of the most intriguing films of 2009. The storyline revolves around the action in the original, with the haunting from Katie's childhood now returning to terrorize the family of her stepsister. The same documentary style that brought an eerie realism the first is used here, and remains effective. The sense of discovery present in the original is diluted, but overall the follow-up is worthy of its predecessor.
B004132HZS|5.0|I was unsure about this adaptation when I first heard about it on PBS. I have fond childhood memories of reading Conan Doyle's works and watching Jeremy Brett. Am overjoyed by the Mary Russell books (Laurie R. King's books are enjoyable). I feel the bar is high for measures of Holmesian adaptations. These stories do not disappoint. This series is a great re-telling of the Conan Doyle works. Dramatic, but very, very funny at times(At least to me.See the opening scene of \\"The Great Game\\". Anyone concerned about the state of the English language-it's for you). If you like mysteries, good dramatic acting, or well written stories-watch this series.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|An updated take on the story of Rapunzel. A young queen has been snatched from her crib and held for years by a woman posing as her mother. The young woman is not permitted to venture outside due to the \\"dangers\\" that lurk. A young thief who is running from the local authorities finds her, and their journey begins. An enchanting love story that looks great in 3D, this film will be enthralling for all who see it. Alan Menken's music is first-rate, There is humor for all ages, and the development of the relationship between the heroine and the hero will captivate adults. There is a paucity of cute and funny characters, which makes the film appeal to a slightly older audience than the typical Disney fare. This is a welcome addition to the line-up of Disney animated films.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|In a movie about a well known super hero, the star is actually the villain. A movie that has several twists and turns especially toward the end, it keeps me on the edge of my seat. The Batman-turn-dark in the perception of the citizens is powerful. I assume it sets the stage for the sequel (\\"Batman rises\\"?)    Blu-ray picture is sharp and audio is clear. Great buy on Amazon now.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|A train is running uncontrolled through the railroad tracks of Pennsylvania, and no one is sure how to stop it. The lives of thousands of people in a local town are at risk. Two men who are manning a train devise a plan to stop the runaway train, putting their own lives at risk. The thrills never stop as this riveting action drama keeps you on the edge of your seat. Conflict is at hand between the personnel on the ground and the executives of the company, bringing an element of drama to the film.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I bought this for my wife, because she's into these movies.  She likes it, so I'm giving it 5 stars.  Also, who can beat the combo pack?  You have a blu-ray for the house, a dvd for the car, and a digital for the computer.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|The Rock appears in this action film about a man involved in a robbery, after which his brother was killed. When his prison sentence concludes, he seeks revenge on those responsible for his brother's death. During his pursuit of those whom he seeks, there is a hitman after him, the reasons for the hitman being hired being unknown to the audience until the film's conclusion. The men that are being pursued are primarily flawed criminals and the character portrayed by Dwayne Johnson has redeeming qualities, so the audience is not asked to invest any moral assessments, but the mystery of the hired assassin elevates this slightly above your standard revenge movie.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|What else is there to say?  This band is great!  This was the #2 selling album of the year for a reason.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|A film chronicling the story of Aron Ralston, a hiker who became stuck in a remote crevice in a Utah canyon, and had to amputate his arm in order to free himself. The movie focuses fully on the ordeal the hiker had to endure, and the extreme actions he took in order to survive. The film can be difficult to watch at times, but with a terrific performance by James Franco, the viewer is captivated by the struggle of a man clinging to life. The will to live is clearly the driving force behind the hiker's unlikely survival. This is a terrific film.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|I've always wanted to hear Gregg do a straight-up, old-time blues record, like the records that were such a big influence on him and the Allman Brothers and that I sought out and listened to as a teenager. With a few reservations, this is that record. Gregg is in fine voice. The songs are strong and varied enough to maintain your interest. The musicians are first-rate and play the material with authority.    Some minor gripes:     - Instead of a Gregg Allman record that T-Bone Burnett produced, to me this sounds like a T-Bone Burnett record that Gregg contributed vocals to, albeit on every track. It's the same deal with Daniel Lanois: the record has as many or more of the producer's hallmarks as it does the featured artist's. As good as the other players are, the music has a kind of unobtrusive, rootsy anonymity that I've heard on other T-Bone Burnett records.     - It sounds tame and tentative in places, like the band hasn't played together much and is holding back.    - Too much compression. Even at low volumes, the drums and bass make my car speakers buzz, like I'm listening to hip-hop or something. This is a surefire way to make something not sound like an old record.     All in all, a very good record from a living legend.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|A young morning show producer is brought in to revitalize a declining program. Not expected to succeed, she attempts to do so by firing the current co-host and bringing in a veteran newsman who believes that the soft stories typical of such shows are beneath him.  He feuds with virtually everyone, and the new producer tries to make the show work. The film worked for me, with Rachel MacAdams superbly cast in a role that she is perfectly suited for.  Just enough insights are provided into the behind the scenes at a morning show, and the movie is lighthearted enough to keep the audience entertained.
0060936223|5.0|A touching story of two artists, whose love for their art was only exceeded by their love for each other. A great read.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|FINALLY, a Paul McCartney Concert DVD, that I really, really LOVE and feel a part of!! This dvd is my favorite in my WHOLE concert library now. Funny, since it came like a gift in a CD pak...Weird? I made my own DVD Box, and my 24 year old daughter is begging me to send her the CDs. He should release this GENYC in it's own DVD package. I have many PM DVDs. But, as was said in other reveiws, there is a lot of commentary, talking and so forth, interupting each concert. Don't get me wrong, I like the other concerts. It's just that, this one seems more PERSONABLE. A fan can feel they are there with Paul for the first time in GENYC. At 67, who would think ANYONE could perform for 2 and a half hours, and still look like he could do another 2 and a half hours. Sure, his voice breaks up a couple of times. But I dare ANYBODY to sing as good as he does at that age! Considering ALL the octives and high and low pitches that he has to cover. There is WAY too much GREAT stuff in here to worry about a couple of breaks in his voice. I've followed The Beatles since their beginning. But, it pains me that, I've never got to see him(them) live! But now, at least I feel like I've gotten to see him, even if it's from the VERY LAST ROW, on this 'GOOD EVENING NEW YORK CITY' concert DVD. And it looks like he's wearing a pair of suade 'Beatle Boots'...Cool! Thank you Paul, what else can I, Say, Say, Say.
B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|I absolutely love the Black Eyed Peas album Elephunk.  Brilliant!      I never really listened to Monkey Business because I was still busy listening to Elephunk.    I gave The E.N.D. a try, but I couldn't get through it.  Everything I used to love the Peas is absent from this recording.  It is trash.  Literally.  I threw the physical album in the trash.  AVOID.
0385341679|4.0|I hate being the first person to give this book a downgrade, but I honestly cannot give it 5 stars.  Before I get to my criticisms, let me give tons of praise for a few things.  The writing itself - my God, KMM is a master author.  Her writing is beautiful, almost lyrical, powerful and so talented I want to cry with envy.  I have to sincerely say I don't think there is a better writer out there.  The first few chapters of the book when Mac discovers who is the dead beast is some of the most powerful chapters in fiction.  I teared up, which for me is major.    Kudos for relationship building.  KMM takes the various relationships in the book and makes them deeper and more satisfying.  They stayed true to the previous books.  No easy task, I'm sure.      The length of the final book was pretty outstanding.  I definitely feel I got my money's worth in this huge volume.  No Laurell K. Hamilton 150 page tome here!  Thank God.      Ok.  My beefs - the Lord Master has been the villian throughout this entire series.  For four books, Mac has had two single goals - kill her sister's murderer (LM) and find the book, so when the Lord Master dies in the fashion he does, it is VERY anticlimatic.  I expected so much more for this scene, and so much more involvement by Mac.  I was very disappointed.  The realization of this goal should have been bonechilling and lengthly.  It wasn't.    Second, the ending.  Three quarters of the book moved along crisply, with revelations happening fast and furious.  They all made sense and they all resolved some problem/event from previous books.  However, when we got to WHO exactly Mac was I felt very letdown.  I felt strangely as if the ending was a cop-out.  Instead of Mac being a major player now and in the future, she actually became more of a situational character.  When all was said and done, Mac wasn't IMPORTANT enough for the major role she played in this series.  Too many other characters actually were hugely involved in resolving the final issues at the end.      Lastly, the relationship between Burrows and Mac - while I am sincerely glad a HEA of sorts was established.  I felt too much was left unsaid, too much trust issues were brushed aside and too many assumptions were made by both parties about each other.      I am sincerely glad KMM has contracted to do another series here.  The foreshadowing in the book leans very heavily toward Dani and Christopher; however, I will definitely wait until the entire series is printed before buying anymore books.  The wait time between each of these books was ridiculous.  I understand that some authors do not write as fast as others, so I'm not sure what the answer is, but 5 years is too long to wait for a conclusion of a series.
0760335540|5.0|I like to perform most of my own maintenance, and was a bit nervous about the Boxster's ease of service. This book leads you through most every maintenance procedure you could imagine and does it step by step. The photos and text are excellent. This book will be a tremendous resource and is highly recommended.
1599218011|5.0|I have been following Kris Carr since she first appeared on Oprah.  At the time, I had very limited exposure to cancer, but her story touched me so much that I watched her documentary Crazy, Sexy Cancer.  I was so inspired by her approach towards her health that I decided to make changes in my own life.  When I found out she was writing a \\"diet\\" book, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  I knew it would be full of information, but I had no idea how AWESOME this book would be!  It's is a fun read and full of great information.  It's one of those books that you want to keep out so you can keep referencing it.  If you have an open mind and are willing to change, this is the book for you!  Even if you start with baby steps, this book can be life changing both physically and mentally!    I bought both the hardback and kindle version.  If you must only get one, I would recommend the hardback.  It is beautifully laid out and great to flip through and grab tips each day.   The kindle version is good to have on the road.    Cheers and happy juicing!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|My wife and I love this new Hawaii Five-O. Just watched the \\"head in the box\\" episode last night. All the actors are perfect for their roles. The \\"new\\" Steve McGarret is ten times more interesting and exciting than the old one. Can't wait for it to be out on Blu-Ray!
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Nickleback are probably the Beatle's of our generation or at least the Spice Girls. Forget the haters obviously they can't see this band is a great band with lots of feirce rock numbers and emotional sad ballads. That's like the entire emotions music has to offer on one CD! Nickleback haters probably listen to Justin Bieber or...... Barney Soundtracks all day, I bet.  A+++++ CD
0634014331|5.0|Great book. The excercises are all good to know techniques across multiple syles. Very solid voicings and good explanations. This book will keep me busy for awhile.
B00026WUBE|5.0|Perhaps it was the fact that my original copy of \\"Planet Waves,\\" bought on vinyl thirty-odd years ago, was a cutout I found in a sidewalk remainder bin. Perhaps I simply wasn't ready, then, for any album so roughly-hewn and personal. For whatever reason, although I have been an avid Bob Dylan fan for more than thirty-five years, I have never, until recently, been particularly taken with \\"Planet Waves,\\" which always struck me as rushed, sloppy, and somewhat chaotic: a feeble \\"first draft\\" of the magnificent [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks (Reis)]], that would be released less than a year later. I returned to \\"Planet Waves\\" recently, though, while updating my Bob Dylan collection with the remastered versions of discs I still owned only in the original CD issues. Imagine my surprise when I found myself instantly swept up in its immediacy, its raw power. Not having listened to these songs for at least a decade, I find myself hearing them now through new ears, as if for the very first time. And I'm loving what I'm hearing! The Band's rollicking, raucous renditions of the material bring to the fore some of Dylan's most unguarded and revealing lyrics; his vocals are naked, drenched with pain. Many years after I first--unfairly--dismissed it, this is well on its way to becoming one of my favorite Dylan albums; I never thought I'd say that! I recommend this largely-overlooked effort very highly; I do, however, have two small quibbles: to begin with, I am not sure that the set especially benefits from the inclusion of competing versions of \\"Forever Young,\\" even though it is a great song, and I'd be hard pressed to say which performance I would have released, had the choice been left to me. Secondly, it remains a crying shame that what is undoubtedly the finest song from these sessions--the magnificent \\"Nobody 'Cept You\\"--was relegated to relative obscurity on [[ASIN:B000002AJG The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased, 1961-1991]] The inclusion of this \\"lost\\" song on the original release would have transformed a near-classic into a stone cold masterpiece. The released version of the album just barely misses the mark, but still ranks among Dylan's more worthy efforts, and clearly merits more respect than it has traditionally received.song on the original release would have transformed a near-classic into a stone cold masterpiece.

031603438X|2.0|What a disappointing effort from such an interesting person. For a man who appears to have lived his life according to his own rules the book seems full of self justification and attempts at image enhancement. Worse, it lacked wit. There was not a single amusing or even particularly entertaining anecdote amongst the whole 600 pages.    A disappointing, poorly written book. At the end of it I knew nothing more about the man than I did when I started, except that he is not a very nice person despite his attempts over 600 pages to make out and criticism of him possible is a result of his lifelong commitment to his \\"art\\".     Borrow it, don't bother buying it.
055313597X|5.0|This was required reading for a college Literature class I was taking. The book arrived in great condition and quickly. What a sad, but enlightening, story.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Oh, this Dvd is sooooo hot. Especially Robert downey Jr and Jude Law. Oh and the packaging and delivery where top hole. 5 stars way up!
0061353248|5.0|This book was interesting and readable. Interestingly, I have often used the concepts discussed when I consider my business's marketing strategies. Not sure that many others use the book as a business book, but for me it works.<br /><br />People are inherently quirky. But most are not uniquely quirky. Thus, the author is able to demonstrate  specific examples of how we all fool ourselves and each other more often than most of us would care to admit.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Freakenomics, you will enjoy this book as well. If you are interested in human behavior, this book will also be of interest. Entrepreneurs may also find a number of valuable concepts they can apply to growing their business.
B00000IZOR|5.0|One of the toys that gets played with the most between our 2 1/2 and 1 year old. They both love pulling the phone behind them, the googly eyes bouncing up and down. Love it, would buy it again.<br /><br />My only concern is how long the cord is, I make sure this toy is kept where I can always supervise play time; but I wouldn't cut it because then they couldn't stand and pull.
0385341679|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I loved this book. Every single thing about it. It made me feel like an emotional wreck. It gave me joy. It gave me concrete absolutes and then took them away up until the very end and kept me guessing. KMM has really out done herself.     This series is without a doubt one of my very favorites. To me there couldn't of been a better book to end this series with. I know I'll re-read the entire thing again soon if only to check for clues and phrases I missed before.
0316098337|5.0|Room by Emma Donoghue has been one of the most memorable reading experiences in a long time.  Days before I finished I was already telling people how great it is.  I won't provide a synopsis of the book because I think not knowing what happens is part of the magic of the book.  I can warn you however that the little five year old Jack who narrates the story will steal your heart.  The reader watches, sometimes breathlessly, as Jack narrates world around him. I give Donoghue all the praise I can give in writing this book.  She captures so effortlessly the perception of a young boy.  She  includes all the the joys and sorrows, confusions and tribulations, loves and hates of a five year old.  In many instances I was left on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next, and many a time I was left near tears at the situations that the characters went through.  There is a lot of sadness throughout the book, but it is ultimately overcome by the bond of love between a boy and his Ma.  I can't give enough stars to this amazing book.  Great Read!
0375714839|5.0|This is a graphic novel based on the author's own experience. The story is unexpected. Graphics help understand the story better. I leaned a lot about the culture, religion, and political situation in Iran. This is a great book! I highly recommend this unique novel.
0385339100|4.0|I picked this up in audio form for my long commutes.  The beginning torture sequence nearly did me in but after that I got into it.  There is too much legal scheming for my taste and I sometimes lost track of the many disreputable characters.  At first I really didn't find any of the characters likable.<br /><br />After a while though, the main character, Patrick Lanigan, the perpetrator of an amazing heist of money does grab your sympathy.  I guess you could call this a \\"plot driven\\" novel rather than a \\"character driven\\" one, and as such, it's not my cup o' tea.  I was mostly waiting to see what would develop between our hero, Patrick, and the beautiful Brazilian woman who partnered his getaway.<br /><br />I won't discuss the ending, only to agree with others that it wasn't adequately prepared for.  The only way I will forgive Grisham for this is if he writes a satisfactory sequel.<br />Again, to agree with others, this doesn't pretend to be great literature and it is exciting in its own, lawyerly way.
B00280LYHS|4.0|It was a great book and i loved it. The opening was one of the best out of all the others. If you see this book, Get it as soon as possible. Period.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Stayed up until late in the night to finish reading the final installment of the fever series.  I didn't love the book as much as some of the previous ones - the final solution didn't seem quite to make sense and there left a lot of open questions.  That said there was some resolution - thank goodness.  Remind me never to read one of her series' again until she has finished the entire thing - it was just too frustrating to wait until this got printed!
B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|This movie is good, but I like the new version with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidmann better. It is very entertaining!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|i bought this book in the first term in 2010 in a library sale thing before i got the kindle for christmas and i LOVED it. i was so desperate to see the movie but when i watched it i was VERY disapointed :(  it was SSSSOOOO different to the book. the book is WWWWAAAAYYYY better. and in the book he`s in year 6 but they changed percy to about a 17 year old and same with annabeth. grover is actually about 27 but he looks percy`s age (in the book). so as u can see the book is AWESOMENESS!!! but the movie is not. :D
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I'll keep this short.  I rarely give albums 5 stars, but this album is about as close to perfection as possible.  Very refreshing sound.  Every time I listen to it, I pick up on something new and interesting.
0385341679|5.0|Never left a comment before; may very well never do so again - but just had to say this series has been incredible this last book tops the lot - sensational doesn't even cover it! I have been entranced from the start as if it is the Sinsah Dubh itself! Please KMM can we have more!
1439107955|5.0|I really can say no more.  It earned all of its four stars and don't let the size stop you from reading every well written word
B0044XV3QY|4.0|Great buy considering the price of the two-disc set in store is the same I got the 3 for.     As for the movie itself, it's a pretty cool movie. I will say this though I was a bit disappointed regarding the picture quality. I have a Sony LED 1080p HDTV and the movie just didn't pop as much as I thought it would. Wasn't nearly as vibrant or good looking as other Blu-rays I've watched, which is quite surprising since it's hailed as one of the best looking movies around.
0385341679|5.0|When the series started 5 years ago, I wasn't a huge fan of the heroine. Too pretty, too clueless, too pink. But Mac surprised me. Her ever growing character, strengthening with each page, breathed LIFE. Watching her angst and joy has been an incredible journey, but Shadowfever blows all the other books in the series away.     The twists and turns this final book had me crying, laughing, chearing and shocked. I didn't expect after reading the other books to ever like Darroc. While rotten to the core, Karen wove a bit of humanity into one who never had it to the point where readers would like him. I never thought that an Unseelie Hunter would endear me but I picture his ugly leathery cold body with a silly grin on his face. I never thought I'd be shocked, not once, but several times throughout the book, to the point where I had to put it down, walk away to absorb what the heck just happened before continuing on. And I never, ever, would have suspected it would end the way it did.     Beautifully written, action packed from beginning to end, Shadowfever answers most of the questions we've all be waiting for, yet opens up an entire new topic to ponder.       Mac may be epic, but I think Karen Marie Moning is also.
6305949980|4.0|Tim Burton has created a masterpiece with this.  Adults and children can sit and watch this together and enjoy themselves.  This movie is exceptional!  We've watched it many times and each time I pick up something that I missed before.
1596680296|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend because I wanted to learn to knit socks after years of knitting other things. It is a good, plain vanilla basic reference on how to knit only one kind of sock--the traditional cuff-down sock made one at a time on double-pointed needles.  Since I wanted to use a long circular needle and the magic loop method, ideally knitting two socks at a time, this book wasn't too useful.  Unlike its competitors, this book uses traditional cast-on and knitting methods, totally ignoring more modern methods (circular needles) and innovations (like Judy's magic cast-on for toe-up socks).  The good thing about this book is that there are charts to use many different weight yarns (not just fine sock yarn) to make different-sized socks.  I am frustrated by internet patterns which assume no woman has a foot bigger than a size 8 to 9, which may be average but doesn't help those of us with larger feet.  The sock patterns in the back are OK, nothing too exciting, but good for the basics.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|Many things have been written about the problems with epI, epII, epIII.  But if you really are a fan of Star Wars then you need to check this set out.  It's got action and the animation is pretty cool.  Clone Wars explains some things from Star Wars and overall is extremely faithful to the main story.  Once you start watching, you'll want to keep on watching.
0385341679|3.0|*SPOILERS*      I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but I couldn't based on one thing:  we still don't know who Barrons is!!  I must admit when I received the book, I flipped to the last couple of chapters to make sure Mac and Jericho were the HEA I was hoping for.  Upon confirmation, I happily started at the beginning.  Cheating, I know, but I had to do it!  I wanted two things out of this book:  1)Mac and Jericho = HEA, and 2)find out what Barrons is.  KMM gave me 1/2 my wish.    This book was filled with surprises/twists/revelations and it was a good read.  V'Lane/Cruce was a REAL shocker and I loved how KMM twisted/turned that one!  However, after 5 years of waiting and wanting to know who/what Jericho Barrons is, we still don't know and that is a huge disappointment for me.  KMM spent great detail and time in revealing most of the answers to the questions we have all been asking for the last 5 years, yet she couldn't answer one more - the primary one we've all been asking from the first book?  I wish I could be satisfied knowing that Mac and Jericho have the HEA, but I can't.  To me, this is like another cliffhanger to the next series, which I will look forward to reading, but it is a huge let down that all our questions were not answered and wrapped up in this book.  I just hope the next series doesn't take five years like this one did!!
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is awesome!  If you like anime, you gotta have this.  One of these shorts is bound to amaze you.  And it looks just like the Matrix.  The second and third movies should have been as good as some of these shorts.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Ive been watching this show since it first started im completely obsessed with it. the best part is that buying off of amazon it helps to have all the DVDs to watch it all over again. hoping for another great season. keep up the awsomness.
B003W77SAS|5.0|I have been looking everywhere for this CD. I remember it from when it first came out in the 1970's and hava always liked this music. Was glad to find it here for a resonable price.
B000002KIT|5.0|I had mainly just been a fan of Thin Lizzie's radio songs in the US. Great songwriting, loved Phil's very present & soullful voice and their take on the dual guitar thing? Sublime. In this day and age when you hear more music in more places than ever before, why is it sometimes so darn hard to just buy an album that you love? So, every now and then the solution to that is to revisit the classics, discovering gems you had missed, or revisiting artists you had nearly forgotten. And I'm always a sucker for a killer live recording-another sweet double-live album that may be equally as brilliant as Lizzie's L&D (much mellower genre)is Little Feat's \\"Waiting for Columbus\\".   I discovered Thin Lizzy's gem of a live album from reading all of you guys' nearly rabid reviews here and it is all true. After getting this awesome CD I must agree with every positive thing said. It is the quintessential release by a very talented bunch of guys and they are just flat out putting it all on the line at the peak of their power. Any of their studio releases I have heard pale by comparison to this epic. It is a perfect live recording, not perfect hi fi audio quality all the time, but perfect in that it conveys the excitement, emotion and rawness of what these guys were capable of. The crossfade edits between tracks in the applause are pretty rough like a couple reviewers mentioned, but no worries. This is a freaking masterpiece and I too will have it in my collection always. Highly recommended.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|The colors are great. The mini figures and their accessories(especially the eskimo hat) are nice to have.  The bright bricks and the bakery theme makes this set also are a perfect gift for the girls.  Elegant details.  In the skating ground, the red pair of skating shoes did not make much sense to me...   The small Christmas trees are not as good as I would have expected. It would be nicer if they have enough handles to put some small bricks on.
B004EC937G|4.0|I've been reading the Duffy reviews and listening to her album for a while -  and you're right. It's not Rockferry, it can't be. It's not a great combination of strong vocals and powerful lyrics - simply because such coups don't come often in an artist's life. They just don't. No one can mass-produce truly qualitative work, unless it follows the same recipe, like Lady Gaga or Britney songs that repeat the same circular structure over different scales. So it can't be Rockferry, it can't be a great album, but it's precisely the album a great singer releases to prepare herself for her next great one; to keep her skill going, her interest, her fans - to keep herself able to create great stuff so, when the time comes, she can do it.  After all, there's only one thing that keeps me listening- not the songs, the lyrics, the mood- but simply Duffy's voice. And that's pretty amazing.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. The comical satire of Holmes makes this book entirely worthwhile to read. The mysteries presented pose no challenge for Holmes, but are always figured out at the last minute. This is one of my favorite books of all time.
B00364K6YW|1.0|Why, oh why, can't they ever get this right on DVD?  I have the old VHS edition, the first DVD effort and now this \\"restored\\" DVD version and the VHS is STILL the only excellent version of this beloved mini-series.     I had high hopes for the restored version, but it's still pretty bad.  The color is much much better than in the previous DVD -- much more vivid.  However, the color is still shifted way too much into the green-blue \\"cool\\" spectrum and the result is vivid, but very cold looking.  It lacks the warm golden tones of the VHS and the broadcast version that one sees on TV.      However, the MAIN problem with the \\"Restored\\" version is that you can ONLY view the series in \\"wide-screen\\" format.  There are no alternate formats on the DVD.  This is a huge problem, because the film was directed and conceived for television, NOT for wide-screen.  A very serious difference:  it means the director composed each shot in such a way that it would look good on a square TV screen and NOT on a wide film screen.  The new wide-screen version is awful:  it drains all the energy and vibrancy out of each frame and creates scenes that are extremely static.  It's not very thrilling to watch the show's characters constantly surrounded by big gaps of space.  There's a myth being spread that wide-screen format is always better, but ask any filmmaker -- it only works if the piece was originally conceived for wide-screen.    We tried to watch this version and we got through exactly one episode before we simply couldn't take it any more.  We pulled out the TV set, unhooked the DVD player, dragged down the VHS player from storage, hooked it in and happily watched the rest of the show on the old VHS tapes.    My big fear is that my VHS tapes will someday degrade and there STILL won't be a decent DVD version.  We need a version with nice color and contrast and in the original television format for the series.
030746363X|5.0|This book rocks! At first I had a hard time keeping up with the crazy rate of information overload, but really it's simple. Tim is hilarious so if's fun to read. LOL multiple times in any chapter. The diet is awesome, the cheat day a miracle, the exercises (swing lifts) are perfect for aging and post runner knees. I add this to my yoga...have lost some inches, feel great and am looking forward to my first cheat day on Saturday. I can do this! There was a slight displaced embarrassment reading the sex part, but hey...I don't need that section since I already have Heaven on earth in this area!<br /><br />I've moved on to his first book, the 4 hour work week and WOW! These books are not best sellers by accident. They're excellent and life changing. Do you want more?

B00081912E|5.0|Q.  What happens when you create a movie that allows the inner Jim Carrey to come out?  A.  You get \\"The Mask.\\"  OK, technically most Jim Carrey movies are designed to allow the inner Jim Carrey out, but this is especially true of \\"The Mask.\\"<br /><br />I first saw \\"The Mask\\" years ago and just recently showed it to some of my children: it never fails to make me laugh.  There are too many humorous moments to mention, but if you can imagine a human being turning into Bugs Bunny, then you have some idea of the concept behind \\"The Mask.\\"  The plot itself is pretty thin: Jim Carrey's character comes across an ancient mask which enables its wearer to allow his inner self out.  Carrey's character, Stanley Ipkiss, turns out to be a cartoonish hopeless romantic.  His mischievous side comes out when seeking revenge on a curmudgeonly landlady and an auto repair shop that gave him a beater of a car as a \\"loaner.\\"  You might want to remember the loaner scene, especially when Stanley gets his revenge on the auto repairmen who are taking advantage of him.  It has something to do with mufflers and discomfort.<br /><br />Of course there's a love interest, and Cameron Diaz (I think this was her first movie) has never looked more beautiful.  There's also the sad sack character who gets the girl in the end.  But mostly, the movie's about the cartoonish comedy of Jim Carrey running amok while wearing \\"The Mask.\\"  As with a cartoon, the device of the mask allows the director and Carrey to fill up the movie with incredible visual gags and a lot of kinetic energy that is Carrey's forte.  The sheer whimsicality and humor of \\"The Mask\\" makes it one of the few movies I'm willing to watch more than once or twice.<br /><br />But beware: The sequel, \\"The Son of Mask\\", (sans Jim Carrey) is painfully unfunny and should be avoided if you don't want to lose a lot of brain cells in the process.

0316098337|3.0|\\"Room\\" by Emma Donoghue  is a fictional, award winning book with a disturbing premise.  The book tells of Ma, who has been kidnapped and locked in a room for seven years by \\"Old Nick\\".  Ma and Old Nick have a son, Jack who is also lives in the room without being able to leave.<br /><br />The book is divided into 5 sections:<br /><br />Presents: where we meet Jack and his ma who are captives in a 12×12 room of a man Jack calls \\"Old Nick\\" because he only comes at night. Jack has never known the outside world (outer-space) except a few shows on TV.  When \\"Old Nick\\" comes Jack has to go into the wardrobe and counts the creaks of the bed-springs if he is still awake.<br /><br />Unlying: Jack discovers the harsh truth about his world.<br /><br />Dying: Jack and Ma escape.  How? that you'll have to read for yourself.<br /><br />After: Trying to adjust to life after Room is tough, both for Ma who becomes instantly famous and Jack who has never even been in the sun.<br /><br />Living: Ma and Jack start their new life, but can they say goodbye to their old one.<br /><br />\\"Room\\" by Emma Donoghue has a very unique perspective, the whole story is told from the view point of five year old Jack.  Jack is very smart and bright, he lives happily in his own little world, unaware that there better or different things than the rigid daily routine he and Ma have devised.  Ms. Donoghue does an excellent job of narrating in the voice of a five-year-old whose only friends are his Ma, inanimate objects and characters on TV.<br /><br />The book was inspired by Elisabeth Fritzl's confinement to a basement in Austria by her monstrous father who sired several children with her.  However, in the book Ma and Old Nick are not related, but its distirbuing enough without incest being involved.<br /><br />\\"Room\\" touches on many themes what is home (the room is Jack's home even after they leave), relative safety (Jack has never been outside), society, happiness, too many choices and more.  Ma and Jack are too unpredictable for the reader to make cliches observations about such themes, which are both intimate and global.<br /><br />The first half of the book is gripping and well told.  The claustrophobic, creepy and eerie feeling of a captive twenty-something woman who is trying to make a warm, fun and loving place for her beloved son comes across in a straightforward way.  Even though Jack is extremely bright, almost too bright some might say, I still felt sucked into the story.<br /><br />However, the second half is where the book lost me.  The improbable escape, the way Ma and Jack were treated by society, professionals and their families seem too much of a stretch.  After following the Elisabeth Fritzel case with some interest this part simply did not resonate with me.<br /><br />The only thing which I found believable in the second half is the way the media is portrayed.  A bunch of blood suckers, if-it-bleeds-it-dies type of people who represent America's fascination with voyeurism.<br />And damned be the consequences.<br /><br />\\"Room\\" is still a good book and a quick read.

0385341679|5.0|This has to be one of the most wonderful series I have had the priviledge to read.  This storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I am now at a loss as to what to look forward to reading now that I have finished them all.  You definitely have to start from the first book to understand it all, but I have never in my life looked forward to each new installment as I have with this series.  Can't be compared to anything else - definitely one in a million.
1593082479|5.0|\\"Treasure Island\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson is an 1883 fictional adventurous and classic pirate story.  The book follows Jim Hawkins,  a young man, who has found a treasure map and with the help of friends hires a crew to find the treasure.  But the crew has their own plans.<br /><br />In the mid 18th Century at a seaside village in south-west England Jim Hawkins, the young son of the keepers of the Admiral Benbow Inn, meets and old seaman named Billy Bones. Quickly Jim discovers that Bones is a pirate and that his old crewmates want Bones' sea-chest.<br /><br />Bones dies and Jim opens his sea-chest to collect the money owed to the inn - only to discover a mysterious oilskin packet.  The packet is a detailed map of an island Jim, together with Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney, hire a crew to sail to the island.<br /><br />But the crew are not the honest sailors they think they are and the sea-cook, Long John Silver, turns out to be the most dangerous one of them all.<br /><br />I read \\"Treasure Island\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson as a young boy and always remembered it as one of my favorites. Recently, as part of a classics book club, I read it again.<br /><br />The two main characters of the book, Jim Hawkins and Long John Sliver have certainly cemented themselves as two of the most intriguing and dimensional characters in literature. I was happy to reconnect with them almost as if they were old friends.<br /><br />The first half of the book was a breeze to read, but the second half was a bit more difficult due to the pirate's slang, cumbersome metaphors and tongue tied conversations.  However, I quickly re-discovered that those quirks were part of the charm of the book.  Even Jim Hawkins admits he has trouble understanding the narrative - so I wasn't alone.<br /><br />I read the Barnes and Noble classics version, which came with a fascinating biography of Stevenson especially regarding \\"Treasure Island\\".  The book was actually written for Stevenson's stepson, after painting the island he started the novel and completed 15 chapters.  Stevenson finished the book in Switzerland writing a chapter a day.<br /><br />Unknowingly, Stevenson created much of the pirate lore which we have been accustomed to.  The pirate speaking almost unintelligibly, a parrot on his shoulder, missing a foot and ready to double cross his best friends for a buck or two.<br /><br />My biggest surprise upon reading \\"Treasure Island\\" as an adult was that I realized that the story is not about Jim Hawkins, but about Long John Silver.  Granted that usually the villain in any book is usually more colorful and fun than the upstanding protagonist - but this discovery has taken by surprise.  Silver's moral ambiguity is well known but just how amoral the character is I never fully realized as a naïve child (even though I have become a naïve adult).<br /><br />I was happy to discover that \\"Treasure Island\\" truly deserves its status as a beloved classic.  The story is suspenseful and the adventure can be enjoyed by children of any age.15 chapters.  Stevenson finished the book in Switzerland writing a chapter a day.

B001HOF8AA|5.0|I first heard Imelda May when she recently appeared as a guest on a National Public Radio program. NPR played a few tracks from this album on air and I was sufficiently impressed that I ordered the CD from Amazon later that day.<br /><br />The rest of this CD is as good as the tracks NPR played on air.<br /><br />This is May's debut album. It's on the Verve label, which has a long history of releasing top jazz artists. May has the talent to take her into the same league as some of Verve's other female vocalists; she's definitely a new artist to watch.<br /><br />May's music is a combination of 1950s jazz and rockabilly. Judging by the album photos and her comments on NPR, she's cultivating the 1950s image. The album photos show her sporting a very 50s hairstyle, a leopard spot top and tight fitting capri pants. All very 1950s.<br /><br />Although she's too young to have been around in the 1950s, she manages to pull off the 1950s style and sound really well, while adding her own twist to them. This is a new artist who should have an interesting career.
0380715430|3.0|\\"The Mother Toungue\\" by Bill Bryson is a book which I highly recommend to any bibliophile of trivia enthusiast (triviaphile?).  For any person who ever had to learn to idiosyncrasies of the language, this book will provide a fascinating overview of the strange rules and nuances of English.  If you think that learning English is not a big deal, try to define the word \\"what\\".<br /><br />\\"The Mother Tongue\\"is divided into 16 distinct chapters. Each chapter can be read on its on and does not build on the previous chapter. Starting with  \\"A Short History of Language\\" touches on how languages developed, and ending with \\"The Future of English\\" the book encompasses many subjects. Pronunciations, varieties, and spelling are all addressed as well as the good and the bad of the English language.<br /><br />Mr. Bryson had the advantage of being an American journalist in England, so he takes into account the American English and English English varieties and the differences (some subtle, some not-so-much) between them.  The first several chapters are a general introduction to English, how it has become the language we speak today and why it has been globally accepted. For obvious reasons these chapters move between what we know, what we think, and what we guess has happened over the course of several centuries.<br /><br />The real meat of the book appears in the latter chapters where a large number of surprising facts appear (Shakespeare introduced 1,685 new words to the language) as well as how the definitions of words changed over time. Bill Bryce is also brave enough to tackle the bane of all English speaking people - spelling.  Among many inconsistencies and illogicalities - as we all well know - the author also manages to make a case for the peculiar spelling of different words.  It seemed to me that Bryson was also sympathetic to spelling reforms, which I am not against for certain words (enough...?) but feel that a great deal would be lost if we spelt words phonetically.<br /><br />\\"The Mother Tongue\\" is not a history book in any sense of the word, but simply a collection of amusing and fascinating pieces of trivia grouped by topic (barley though).  As a person that had to learn English as a second language, the curiosities of the structure and strangeness of spelling were always<br /><br />While I did not find this book as laugh-out-loud amusing as Bryson's other books, I was still glad I read it.

B002VKE0XA|2.0|I will start by stating, Paranormal Activity is certainly nothing new. The concept has been done to death, and this film is no different than any other of its kind. Paranormal Activity, to put it bluntly is a rip-off of the Blair Witch Project, only filmed inside a house.     The film is shot in black & white, uses shaky hand-held-camera throughout except for when the couple is sleeping. The film is poorly acted (yes, I realize these are nobody actors, but I've better school acting) and very   unbelivable and equally poorly shot. There was zero script and storyline directly lifted from any paranormal documentary found on television. Oren Peli should be smacked for giving himself the title of director/writer because neither of these existed in this *cough* film.     The best part of Paranormal Activity is that I laughed at it and its core audience for shelling out enough green for the studio to make another one (which, I hear is better but I doubt it).     Here is why I gave the movie 2 stars. 1) Micah Sloat was enjoyable to listen to when he made fun of Katie Featherston's character because she  acted like an idiot. If you are having that serious of an issue you move regardless of what your spouse or anyone says, and 2) the loud noises,  i.e. banging were at times scary, however most were expected & fell flat.    Lastly, the ending without giving it away was terrible. I laughed & never jumped. Was it supposed to be scary because it was cheesy and pathetic.    On a quick side note, I love paranormal documentaries and movies, often watching them with the lights out and at home alone but PA was lousy at achieving what others succeed at.

B0030Y11XS|1.0|What we have in American is NOT capitalism and certainly is NOT free markets. We have corporatism/fascism. It is the merging of corporations and the government. There are 50+ people in high ranking positions in our government that have either former employment/strong ties to Goldman Sachs. This is no secret. Obama, the puppet, has completely surrounded himself with nothing but Wall Street people. The Fed (a central bank) has raped the American people for trillions of dollars by creating money out of thin air and inflating the dollar. Moore attempts to bash capitalism and then pushes socialism/communism in a typical bait and switch fashion. Do NOT fall for it. This is pure propaganda meant to prop up Big Government and the to fascist state. This does not mean that the right is any better, but socialism and communism are the absolute worst forms of government.     Government is the most inefficient manager of money in world history. Examples in this country of socialism are Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, etc. All of these take money from all to benefits others. They are entirely bankrupt and dragging our economy down with it. Social Security is the largest Ponzi Scheme in world history. People that do not receive benefits are paying directly for the benefits of those that do receive them. It is NOT a retirement fund and it is NOT a trust. If you want some real truth about the government, capitalism, the Fed, etc., then read Ron Paul's books and avoid the Hollywood propaganda that supports an agenda that has amount to $14+ trillion in national debt. Every single dollar that you and I pay in federal income taxes goes directly to pay the INTEREST on the national debt. It does not go to ANY services that we would expect to receive for this $2 Trillion in taxation. People will say, \\"How will we pay for roads and schools?\\" Roads are paid for with the gasoline tax and schools are paid for with property taxes. Knowledge and the truth is key here. Do your research and learn what is REALLY going on...not what Hollywood tells you what is going on. Any truthful documentaries about the government will NEVER make it to the silver screen. This has already been proven when the government went after Mark Cuban for attmepting to bring a hard hitting documentary to theatres.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great movie. The collector's edition completely tells the story, adding parts to the movie that were relevant making the movie a much more complete experience. Overall, I am pleased with this movie.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Very nice album. Sometimes very reminiscent of Searching for Simplicity. IMO not five stars due to there being only one original and relying on blues covers... which by the way are done very well! The backing band is perfect for the music and the production is fantastic. Artwork is great as well. Just Another Rider is the best song and the closest to a classic gregg allman sounding song, although I think at times it may sound too much like \\"high cost of low living\\" which once again IMO is a superior song. Almost like it was a leftover from the hittin the note sessions. Nice to hear a contrast between the intense blues rock of the ABB and then this country blues. His voice is killer and has aged so well. I think this album is really more like 3.5 stars because what I want to hear is more of gregg's songwriting!!! Remember the killer songs he wrote in the seventies and the brand new ones on hittin the note? Just another rider was great so get your butt back to work with warren and turn out ten more!

Michael life is and should be told just the way it is in this autobio.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|The milieu the characters of \\"Winter's Bone\\" inhabit is truly a world unto itself: a rural land where grinding poverty rules, where clannish ties run thick, where guns and hunting are an integral part of daily life, where acts of brutality and violence alternate with simple acts of charity and kindness, and where outsiders are viewed with suspicion and paranoia.<br /><br />In this richly atmospheric film of the Daniel Woodrell novel, Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a dilapidated shack with her mentally ill mother and a younger brother and sister, whom Ree is essentially raising.  When the sheriff comes to inform her that her father, who's been arrested for crank production, has put up the family's home and land as bail, Ree goes in desperate search of him to ensure that he doesn't skip out on his court date.  However, as the young woman journeys through the area seeking information as to his whereabouts, she finds herself involved in a situation fraught with far more mystery and danger than she could have imagined when she first set out.  All this leads to Ree having to decide between strictly adhering to the \\"code of the hills\\" - in which the ties of blood trump all else - or of violating it and doing what is right for herself and her immediate family.<br /><br />Writer/director Debra Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini immerse the audience so thoroughly in the Ozark setting that it takes us awhile to fully shake off the experience and to reorient ourselves to our own environment once the movie has ended.  It's a beautifully observed landscape of gnarled trees, car tires, chopped wood, rusted-out vehicles and hay bales, where the sounds of cattle lowing and coyotes howling compete with the twang of a banjo and country music songs playing mournfully on the radio.  Indeed, so cut off does this place seem from the outside world that many of the modern conveniences the rest of us take for granted - computers, cell phones, the internet - seem almost completely absent from the setting.<br /><br />In terms of storyline and drama, the filmmakers scrupulously avoid resorting to melodrama or clich&eacute;s to get their points across.

0316789798|5.0|Just bought this drawing book for my 4-year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She follows the step-by-step directions and does pretty good for a pre-schooler.  She's been wanting to draw her own animals and this book has really empowered her.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|I have to say that this by far the most beautiful movie ever. The music, and the visual effects blend together to create perfection. The owls seem to have feathers you can feel, the sky seems to go on forever. By far one of the best family movies made this year. If you get a chance to see this let your imagination fly. You will never forget the experience.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I bought this to watch with my grandson and I have to say it was a blast. The characters were LOL funny, sweet and the story very cute. A delightful film.
0760703329|5.0|I've wanted to get this book for quite some time to increase my literary education. I finally did for myself for Christmas 2010 and have been very satisfied with the delivery and the book itself. Thanks for sending so quickly.
B004DK49V4|4.0|I have been a fan since Prison Bound, so every album since has a different feel to it and slightly different style. This album, prior to coming out was compared to the Dead Boys, The Black Crowes and the Rolling Stones. That pretty much nailed it. It sounds more like a polished version of Prison Bound meets Mike Ness's Solo Album Cheating at Solitaire. I can't say it's the best Social DIstortion album, compared to the previous release of \\"Far Behind\\" single and \\"Sex, Love and Rock-N-Roll\\" it didn't go in that direction instead this album is very tame compared to that and very produced. With that said, it's still Social Distortion. It's a solid rock-n-roll album, but not many instant hooks, however if you listen to it more that 2 or 3 times you will catch yourself humming songs off it trying to figure out which song it is. With each listen it grows on me. But even a tame Social DIstortion album is still better than 98% of the crap coming out now, so buy it. My only complaints is I have versions of nearly all the songs that were B-Sides or live versions that had been played over the past 20 years- I wish there were more songs, also the back up singers sound wrong, I am talking about the women singing soulfully on california hustle, i just skip that track now, because it just doesn't sound right, not bad, just not right. either way Long Live Social D.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|i thought this book was so cool. i have hope to read it again. i wish there were more books after specials.
B000O178BY|4.0|Trent Reznor was the composer for The Social Network.  It was a great score and really fit the mood of the movie.  I don't really like electronic music, but this album is a good introduction to NIN.  I enjoy the exposure to new music styles.
0143038583|1.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is New-Age sophistry peppered with inaccurate scientific-esque observations written so as to titillate the reformed hippie and the uneducated acolytes that worship at the alter of misinformation and Mother Earth.  If you want a New-Age fairy tale, read The Omnivore's Dilemma.
B002N4DYZO|5.0|I own many versions of Beethoven's only opera; this is my absolute favorite Fidelio.    Vickers, Ludwig, Frick, and Berry are in excellent form and Klemperer conducts expertly. This performance gives me goosebumps every time I play it.
B00402FGEE|5.0|I enjoyed this new series. I watched every show live with the exception of one episode. Only because I was still programed to view \\"Stargate\\" on Friday nights and missed a show on Tuesday.  \\"Stargate\\" on a Tuesday night how stupid is that? Anyways, as a fan of \\"Stargate\\" from the beginning I have enjoyed the entire franchise. I have supported the franchise by purchasing all the DVDs and continue to support by buying the Blu-ray version of this series as well.  I'm not going to tell you how great this show is or how bad it is. There are enough people here with their bla bla bla.  I will say that if you wish to continue to enjoy quality Science Fiction Entertainment perhaps you should send a clear message to the Studios that make it and to the Networks that play it. Watch it and then buy it. Only then will Networks stop cancelling Quality Science Fiction shows.  By the way the Picture Quality on this Blu-ray version is absolutely breathtaking.
B003E48AYC|5.0|This is a good film. actually, If you are a Johnny's fan you obviusly watched the movie and I'm sure you think Johnny Deep is a the best actor of this generation.   I encourage the public to watch this film which is visually amazing and astonishing.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this for my 5years daughter's Christmas present.  At first, I worried about is this ok to her age.  But She love it. She tried to win it and also she think about how to do it.  I read lots of review of this game.  Thanks for helping choose this game.
B0032JTV74|5.0|Just amazing. Glee is the best TV series of the world. I'm so glad that glee had won a golden globe of the best TV series twice. I can't wait to watch 3 season I'm sure it will be awesome and glee director confirmed Anne Hathaway will play a role in the series.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I adored this book! Loved seeing characters from some of her other books make an appearance. While I sometimes found the rest of the fever series frustrating at times for a few reasons, to me the final installation made the entire series worth it. It was a roller coaster! Fast paced, touching, funny, emotional, and unpredictable. There was quite a bit I personally didnt see coming and not a second of this book I didn't enjoy. There was a few loose ends I was surprised that KMM didnt wrap up, but was happy to see the last page giving hope that we might see some of these characters again someday. I can't wait!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|\\"Toy Story 3\\" may have won the Golden Globe award for best animated film, but far and away the BEST animated film in 2010 was \\"Despicable Me\\".  I've seen both films and although very good, \\"Toy Story 3\\" cannot match \\"Despicable Me\\" at any level.  \\"Despicable Me\\" is funnier and will appeal to adults as well as children.  Steve Carell is outstanding. This is a film you will want to watch more than once, it's a classic.
0385341679|5.0|In a word - this book was epic.  I absolutely loved it and it wrapped up a lot of unanswered questions.  Karen Marie Moning is my favorite romantic author of all times.    That being said, I will never buy another \\"series\\" book from this author until the final book is released in the series.  As a reader, the cliff hangers and foreshadowing that didn't give you any answers for the first 4 books (over 1,300 pages) made this series less enjoyable for me.  I didn't appreciate sitting for a year waiting to know what happens after the heroine was gang raped.  Even more than that, I don't like spending a year and a half speculating on who she accidently killed.  The cliffhangers and waiting didn't add to the reading experience, it made it hard for me to concentrate on the story when the next book came out because I was so busy searching for answers that weren't there.    While I understand that good things take time and the author can only write at the pace she can write at; I will not be putting myself through a reading experience like this again.
006091307X|4.0|I don't normally advocate criminal behavior, but if you're going to read this book, I might suggest you smoke something a bit stronger than tobacco if you're into that kind of thing.  It might help to bring this book into focus.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the author was in a similar state when he wrote it.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much I can tell you about the plot.  We start off with Oedipa Maas, a young suburban California housewife, who finds out that she's been named executor of her ex-boyfriend's estate.  While diligently attending to the estate (not to mention attending to her co-executor), she stumbles upon a symbol scrawled on a bathroom wall with a reference to something called \\"WASTE\\".  Oedipa develops an obsession with the symbol which seems to pop up with increasing frequency the more she pursues its meaning.  Her adventures lead her from person to person, each character more bizarre than the last, and from unbelievable situation to impossible event.<br /><br />This book is maddeningly impossible to get your head around.  Nothing ever quite makes sense, but there's always something tantalizing just around the bend.  Maybe if you read a few more pages it will start to make sense.  But the further you go on, the less sense it makes, but yet the more we feel we might just get rewarded if we read a little further.<br /><br />We follow Oedipa's descent into conspiracy madness through a long-winded description of a five-act Jacobean revenge play, an encounter with a truly mad scientist, an all-night ramble through the seamy side of San Francisco, the intricacies of stamp collecting, and epic accounts of the obscurest points of the history of mail delivery (although, how much, if at all, that \\"history\\" resembles reality is more than I can say).<br /><br />At one point in her obsession, Oedipa looks at the possibilities.  Either she's stumbled into one of the most elaborate conspiracies in the history of the world, or she's been set up by her late ex-boyfriend in some sort of elaborate hoax, or else she's mentally ill.  We sense all along that the author is playing with Oedipa, poking fun at her and her frail human ability to grasp and comprehend.  But then we realize that he's poking fun at us too.  And at life itself and all of our grand and serious searching for The Meaning of Life.<br /><br />The characters are mostly quite unsympathetic and unengaging.  Mostly that's because they don't stick around long enough for us to get to know them.  But even the main character, Miz Maas, doesn't arouse our sympathy.  That's because none of the characters are actual human beings; they are mere symbols in Pynchon's game of life.  Our clue is in their corny, punny names:  \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Genghis Cohen, you get the picture.<br /><br />The book is not meant to be taken as a literal story any more than \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is.  Both are satires.  But unlike \\"Gulliver's Travels\\", it is unclear who or what is being satirized in \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\".  Some things are obvious, like America's post-war cookie-cutter suburban blight and the empty lives that accompany such blight.  But it's more than that, though what the \\"more\\" is, is always just out of reach.<br /><br />Although this is a very slim volume, it's not easy reading.  Pynchon's wordy prose can at times go on for pages without completing a single paragraph.  It is almost always difficult to follow exactly what's happening and to keep the characters straight.  Nonetheless, I recommend this book as an introduction to Thomas Pynchon largely because it is so short.  Judging by the reviews, Pynchon has a devoted following and a number of critics.  This book is perfect for discovering which you are.  For myself, I'm not quite sure yet.  I ended up liking the book in spite of myself, but I don't really think it will stick with me.  Some ambiguous books leave me puzzling over them for weeks or months to come, but I don't think this will be one of them.aborate hoax, or else she's mentally ill.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I watched this movie with my kids and loved it as much as they did.  I found the best price for it here on Amazon!!
0385736002|4.0|i'm going to say this with good intention: michael scott is no jk rowling. while the harry potter series effortlessly glide with your imagination while reading, this book (and the series) requires more focus and attention to details while reading. and because the pace of the story is quite fast it can be quite hard to follow the story if you're not paying close attention. hence, multitasking while reading this book is certainly not recommended.     having said that, this book is somehow captivating and intriguing enough to make you want to keep on reading. the charm of mr&mrs flamel and the bravery of the twins would make you want to know what happen to them, how they will get their power and how the story would end. so far i've read the first 3 books and i can't wait to read the next books.
0385341679|5.0|I must admit that I simultaneously dreaded and eagerly anticipated the release of this book.  So many authors have disappointed me recently in their conclusions to their series and I didn't want MacKayla Lane's story to be added to that list.    However, Karen Marie Moning, you...are...awesome.  I loved the entire book.  Thank you.  This was well worth the wait.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I decided I needed to lose a few pounds, but didn't think I had the time this dvd looked promising in that it has approximately 20 minute workouts. I figured for the price I would give it a shot.  The workouts were killer.  Although I considered myself to be in pretty decent shape, the first workout killed me.  It took me a long time to work up to level 2, and then even longer to get the courage to try level 3.  And I was wrong about being in decent shape.  After doing this dvd 5-6 days per week for about 6 months, I had lost 35 lbs and 4 inches on my waist with very little change to my diet. Even now, in much better shape, I still work up a pretty decent sweat in 20 minutes.      Can't recommend this enough.  I'm not a fan of seeing the intro every time you startup (it has about a 4 minute intro that it won't let you skip or fast forward), but that isn't enough to bring it down from 5 stars - it is that good. I've recommended it to many friends and family members.  For less than half the price you'd pay for a month at a cheap gym, this will give you a great workout from home.
B003O85W3A|2.0|I love the Arcade Fire. They're an interesting band with a style that's hard to define, and a great first 2 albums. I think I may have been 14 when I heard \\"The Funeral\\", and it was unlike anything I've heard. I was excited when The Neon Bible came out, and when I heard it, I was on the floor.<br /><br />Unfortunately The Suburbs is boring and uninspired in comparison here. There's about maybe 3 songs on here that of worthy of listening to over and over, and the rest is all repetitive. I swear after track 2 I was wondering if my vinyl copy was broken/problematic, because it's so damned repetitive. Almost all the tracks have the same pattern of \\"start off slow/start music about a minute in/delay vocals 30 seconds after/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus/verse/chorus/long end\\". That, plus Butler's whining is becoming just plain annoying to the point where I wanna superglue his lips together to make sure he doesn't make that grating noise, ever.<br /><br />We Used To Wait, Empty Room and Suburban war are the 3 tracks that are worthy of listening to, and the rest is boring and repetitive doss. A major disappointment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked up this book with no knowledge of what it was about, but as soon as I started reading I couldn't stop. I finished in a day and thought it was great. I read some of the lower reviews to see what it was they didn't like and I was kind of surprised. Many said that the book was too gruesome. I completely disagree. While the idea of what is happening is shocking and brutal, I think it was done in a way that it wasn't too gruesome or graphic. Especially too much to give the book 1 star. I'll definitely be recommending it to many friends and family members. And I'm positive I'll read it again.
0307454541|1.0|I DON'T GET IT. I too had read great things about this trilogy.....so I went ahead and purchased it. What a waste! I could not even get through the first 50 pages.....I could not get into the book, I could not understand it, could not follow it at all. I put the book away for a few months then mentioned it to my sister-in-law - she said she would try to read it. She informed me that she was really mad at me for giving her such a stupid book to read. She could not get into it either. Her sister, who lives in another state, could not get into it either. None of us can figure out why people think this book is great.  My son who is 25 said he would try it. He did not even make it through the first chapter. Do not waste your time or your money on this terrible book.
030746363X|3.0|This book is the ultimate weight loss book, it provides different ways to loose weight and some that are more effective than others. Great book interesting to learn new ways to loose weight, and great explaination to find out what works and what does not work and why!

B0041KKYEW|4.0|\\"Black Swan = intense\\"<br />Those were the words used by my cousin on her fb status to describe the movie right after watching it on the theater and I think is the best description anyone can give it.<br /><br />Stripped down \\"Black Swan\\" is pretty simple, a ballerina trying perfect her art. Most of the film is exclusively Portman's viewpoint. We get to see how unstable she is but I rarely got to understand what she was actually feeling. For the life of me I have no idea if she loved the mom or hated her same with the instructor or if she even considered Mila a friend. Maybe I'm not Avant-garde enough to get all the intricacies of the character or maybe there isn't much more to gather...<br /><br />In any case where Black Swan triumphantly succeeds is in its execution. Aronofsky elegantly follows Portman's every step like a shadow of her darker self waiting for the right moment to come out. His camera movements are truly a stroke of genius. Even on the dancing numbers there is so much fluidity, its such a treat to see not only the characters waltz through with the music but the cameras too.<br /><br />As the movie progresses the tension increases too until it reaches boiling points. As the events continued I kept going omg omg something big is going to happen [spoiler] the mom is going to end up killing her, she is going to end up being Beth's alter ego, , I think I saw a monster on the trailer oh man when is it going to appear but like that Family Guy spoof section of Jedi where everyone signals each other for 5 minutes before executing the plan to rescue Luke. The build up was bigger than the execution. Not that the final act wasn't cool because I did like it but the build up was unnecessarily inflated.<br />[/spoiler]<br /><br />All in all a well done film. Kinda like Kill Bill where you take a simple story but elevate it to awesomeness by making it artistically beautiful and engaging. But Kill Bill was better ;)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I absolutely loved the first book so I had very high expectations for this book.  I cannot say that I was disappointed but I do not think that is book was as good as the first book.<br />The beginning portion of the book is a bit of.a love triangle between Katniss, the main character of the series, and her two possible suitors, Gale and Peeta. I do not think that this alone is why it is not as good of a book as the first, I think that the problem is that the love triangle is the main plot for most of the book.<br />If you are looking for the page-turner that the first one was, don't give up on this book, just beware that the suspense takes longer to get to in this book. I couldn't put it down for the last 30% of the book but I just wish it were more than that.<br />I think it was a very good book and if the first one wasn't one of my favorite I had read in a long time, this book would have been amazing. Just beware on this one there is a bit of a cliffhanger so you will probably have to read the third one if you start this second book in the series.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|I'm going to be biased because I absolutely loved this movie. Great for adults and kids. I think in every cartoon there is a lesson to learn for both kids and adults. In this movie, it would be not to be an evil villain for kids, but for adults it's about a story of a lonely guy who adopts kids for the wrong reasons, but ends up loving them. Great movie! Love Steve Carrell he makes any movie fun to watch. :)

6305131090|5.0|This is undoubtedly Ken Russell's masterwork. This railroad movie works as pivot to set in motion through his admirable Symphonies the most dramatic events that nurtured and forged his life, childhood, the deal with the condition of being Jewish, the eternal conflict of his impoverished father, his necessity to listen the unsaid voices of nature as well as the military bands and his untamed devotion for music. Filmed through a marvelous narrative ellipsis, he is aware Alma is not precisely the most faithful of the women.<br /><br />There are superb highlights all along the movie, like his initiation to the Catholic-Wagnerian cult, spiced of enraptured irony (using well known of Wagner's Ring) or the erotic dance of Alma surrounded of a bunch of faithful admirers dressed of Nazis.<br /><br />I think this is Ken Russell' s masterpiece.

0380820846|3.0|I found myself feeling a bit blah while reading this one.  Didn't quiet do it for me, although I do have to say I was on a Quinn kick and read one after another, so it may have been I was od'ing on her.  Did give an average rating of 3 stars, worth the read, but didn't rock my world.
B003UYV08E|1.0|Waste of time for me to watch it and what a waste of money to make. This movie is as good as Spider-Man III. That's how bad it is. Who ever OK'd this project should be forced to watch this stinker until they scream! \\"Forgive me for I don't know what I was thinking!\\" That's the problem no one was thinking when this got made. I want my two hours back! Watch the first Iron Man again if you want a good Marvel movie.

B0034G4P7G|1.0|I gave into the hype. I really did. As I did time and time again. But yet time and time again I keep getting disappointed. \\"The Social Network\\" did nothing right for me. It didnt start good, then slowly trickle down the hole of suck. The very first scene I was turned off. They spoke so fast, I didn't understand a thing, and they made Mark come off as a complete jerk. Not someone I would root for. Everyone that I gave this movie to said the same thing. Not a moment or scene of the movie I remembered either. And the ending was so abrupt it made me and my roommate go, \\"WTF? Are you serious?...wait...this can't be the ending.\\" It embarrased me, to say the least.    All in all, I'm not knocking the fans of the movie, if you love it that's great. I'm just delivering my honest to God opinion that I didn't enjoy it. \\"The Social Network\\" is terribly overrated.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|wonderful tale of humanity and strife. encompasses all depths of emotion. I wrote a much longer review but my kindle deleted it all. so I'm not writing everything I feel about it. But it's not the unsophisticated story known in the classic films. It's much more eloquent.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I have no interest in the Special Edition, and I refuse to be those suckers who fall for it every format change because they feel there it's the best they can get.  I won't soil the memory of the real original trilogy by watching these knock-offs.

B000FC2L1E|4.0|The first two books were utterly compelling and impossible to turn off my kindle. This one is not quite in the same league as the first two but nevertheless riveting.

B000NY17J6|5.0|Linda Ronstadt didn't need original material to have plenty of American hits during the seventies with her versions of mostly well known songs, although she also helped to gain recognition for Warren Zevon and for Kate and Anna McGarrigle via her recordings of their songs. This formula was markedly less successful for her in Britain, where none of her singles made the top 20, although that could be due first to Brits being slow to recognize her talents, then to changing fashions as punk took over for a while. Nevertheless, Linda's music found a market in Britain and I am part of that market.<br /><br />Pairing the hits compilations originally released in 1976 and 1980, this set contains all her important solo hits in the American pop charts and four of her six top ten solo hits in the country charts. Linda's biggest hits thereafter were a duet with James Ingram (Somewhere out there) and two duets with Aaron Neville (Don't know much, All my life) and some country hits taken from the first Trio album that she recorded with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. If you particularly want any of those later tracks, they are all available elsewhere. For the period up to 1980, this contains all the essentials although it most certainly does not contain everything worth hearing; you only get that by acquiring the individual albums from the period.<br /><br />Among the pop hits, seven of the tracks here made the American top ten including You're no good, which made number one, having previously been an American hit for Betty Everett and a UK hit for the Swinging Blue Jeans, and When will I be loved (previously a hit for the Everly brothers), which made number two in the American pop charts and number one in the country charts. The only other single to do well for Linda in both pop and country charts was Blue bayou (a cover of the Roy Orbison classic), which made the top three in both charts.<br /><br />The other country hits represented here are Love is a rose (a Neil Young song that became a minor pop hit) and I never will marry (a traditional song featuring Dolly Parton on backing vocals that didn't make the pop charts). Two other top ten country hits (Crazy, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you) are not featured. As some non-hits are included, their omission is curious, but those tracks are available elsewhere.<br /><br />Two of the three minor UK hits (Tracks of my tears, Blue bayou) are here, but Alison is omitted; all of them did much better in America.<br /><br />If you only want one collection of Linda's music and you are primarily interested in her seventies music, this is a good choice.it) and I never will marry (a traditional song featuring Dolly Parton on backing vocals that didn't make the pop charts).

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I bought the model previous to the X41s thinking they'd go great with my new Plasma TV. Little did I know that Wireless Analog RF and Plasma televisions don't mix. Thankfully, with the arrival of X41s with Wireless Digital RF, the Plasma and I are able to play 360 together.    The Good:  - Comfortable for long playing sessions  - Surround sound is fantastic  - Chat works great  - Powered by USB  - Optical input AND passthrough, so you can still keep your 360 hooked up to an external sound system  - Accepts an analog signal  - Has an output for stereo headphones on the front, so you can attach a second set of headphones without having to purchase another set of X41 headphones  - Supports multiple X41 headphones (if you've got the coin)  - Works with LCD AND Plasma televisions  - Accepts any Optical signal, be it from your cable, PS3, AppleTV, etc.    The Bad:  - Power hungry. The headphones eat up a lot of battery, so I recommend investing in some rechargeable AAA batteries - it's not only environmentally conscious, but you'll save some serious coin over time.  - Annoying cutting out/loud clicks through headphones when low on power (though this occasionally occurs even with new batteries)  - Limited range - in practice, I'd say it's no more than 15 feet  - Only one optical input, so you can't hook up multiple optical sound sources  - Optical Pass-Through is ACTIVE, meaning you MUST have it hooked up to a power source for the optical signal to pass through  - Causes 802.11n interference (probably a/b/g as well) if you keep the base near any wireless source. Therefore, keep the base station away from your AppleTV, 360, laptop, etc. (I kept having issues with my AppleTV's connection and this was the culprit!)  - Wireless headphones occasionally turn themselves off if the source and headphone volumes aren't loud enough (a real problem if you want to keep the volume down and the game/show you're watching goes quiet as well)    So there you have it, the pros and cons. There are definitely issues, though for me, at least, the benefits outweigh them. Also, please note that I've owned these since September '09 and still use them frequently, so the build quality is high enough to withstand at least 17 months of use...which is, sadly, saying a lot these days.
0385341679|5.0|After 8 straight hours, I finished reading Shadowfever.  Karen Moning made sure to answer all the questions readers have been asking throughout the last 4 books in her series.  That being said, this is not a series to read out of order.  For Shadowfever to make sense, you have to have read the previous 4 books.<br />I do not want to give anything away, but just know that this story will take you on an emotional and mental roller coaster that leads up to an exciting and climatic ending!  There are many twists and turns that will leave you pondering the events that unfolded for hours afterwards.<br />I highly recommend this series.  I rarely pre-order books, but this one was a must for me and it was worth every penny!  Enjoy the ride!
B0043RSE2M|4.0|I'm not much of a Steve Carell fan, but as long as you have a 3D system, this is one for the library.  Enjoyable entertainment for all with all the extras.  With the choice of 3D, Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy, even if you plan on upgrading your system it's worth it.
B004DK49DW|3.0|Like a lot of people, I've been a fan from the early days - since hearing 1945 on Rodney on the Roq so many years ago.  And I've seen them 15-plus times live. But to be honest, this is the first album I've been slightly disappointed in.<br /><br />The background singers, the piano and other flourishes would seem to make this a great Mike Ness solo album... or a Black Crowes album. Actually, that's not too far off. There certainly have been country and Western influences that have cropped up over the years, but this is the first time I've heard Southern influences. I've always considered them the quintessential southern California band, so the Southern thing is hard to square.<br /><br />Now, all of this could be overlooked if they brought an A-game of songs, but sadly they haven't. There's usually been one kind of wink-wink-nudge-nudge song - Sick Boy, When She Begins, Nickels and Dimes - but there's too many here. More references to Bonnie and Clyde, classic cars, and all the stereotypical greaser thing is fine in small doses, but it just becomes tedious parody that makes it hard to take things seriously when it's overdone.<br /><br />Far Side of Nowhere, Writing On the Wall, and Take Care of Yourself are easily the 3 weakest and worst songs SxDx have ever released.  They not only lack the traditional SD sound, they really are generic, '90s alt rock lite, reminiscent of Gin Blossoms or something equally bland.  It makes me cringe to think this album would be anyone's introduction to the band based on the weaker material.<br /><br />Also, the production here smooths things over like never before. There is less energy, less aggression. I heard Ness say this album was one of guitar tones, but I much preferred the awesome range of tones displayed on White Light White Heat. Yes, yes, people age and are hopefully in better frames of mind as they move on in years, but as resurgent albums from the likes of Killing Joke and Swans and even Bad Religion last year showed - you don't have to lose intensity if you focus and continue to dig deep.<br /><br />Overall, I don't hate this album, but it is probably my least favorite. You may want to check out \\"Our Refining Days\\" by Strange Rebel Frequency for a slightly darker take on SoCal rock music.you focus and continue to dig deep.

0802473156|5.0|Amazing book! It was an easy read and it makes you really look at yourself and your spouse. Would recommend this book for couples and for single people who are looking for a relationship.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Thi sis a great concept, fun to watch and well-acted.  It is a little slow in the middle but the ending is very creative and well-done.
0385341679|5.0|NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />First off, it's almost impossible to review this book, and not also be reviewing the series as a whole.  This book will be lost on you if you haven't read the first four books.  READ THEM.  You won't regret it (well, maybe you would if you had to wait years for a resolution, but you don't anymore)!<br /><br />I loved this book series.  I felt it got better and better, and the final book didn't disappoint.  The FEVER series has everything you could want - action, romance, mysteries, fantasy, intrigue, philosophy, and so much more.  When I started the series (my first KMM books), I expected a quick romance read with little substance...just something to pass an afternoon or two  What I got was new worlds to learn and explore, terribly fascinating characters that I wanted to know and countless mysteries to solve.<br /><br />When I reached THE END of ShadowFever, I was elated and devastated, which is probably the sign of a great author.  I have wanted closure to these books since I started reading them, and this book gives it to you (but of course in KMM style, she leaves you wanting a little more...enter spin-off series).<br /><br />Before reading ShadowFever, I had concrete theories about how to answer all of my questions.  Well, I will say that throughout reading the book, I actually started forgetting these so-called \\"concrete theories\\" and a million more were popping up.  She keeps you on your toes the entire book.  I am usually never shocked by a book (I always see those twists-and-turns coming a mile away); I got a few of those theories right, but I was definitely surprised by some of the plot.<br /><br />I said above that the book didn't disappoint, and overall it doesn't.  That being said, there are always parts of a book that you wish were slightly different, and I admit I did feel that way a few times, but overall, KMM's FEVER series was nothing short of amazing, and I highly recommend the series.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Finished it this morning and am still processing everything that happened.  There were so many twists and turns but it all made sense in the end.  It has been a great series and I was not let down by this book, at all.  I am so glad I read it on my Kindle, otherwise I would have sneaked a peek at the last chapter/pages and that might have ruined it for me a little.  I recommend you try to read it as Karen intended and don't skip ahead.  It's definitely worth it.  Brava, Ms. Moning, and thanks for a great book!
1416550550|2.0|I just could not get into this book. Made it though about a hundred pages but it just did not interest me enough to want to finish the book, the reviews and the intro made it sounds fantastic... but this story was just very lacking to me- which is sad because I think it had potential to be a wonderful. There were just too many jumps back and forth between dates and characters for my taste.
1451539401|4.0|Although this isn't my favorite, like Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice, it is still an enjoyable read.  I feel that I can never go wrong with Jane Austen, one of my all-time favorite authors next to Virginia Frazier.
0385341679|5.0|Shadow Fever is a stunning closure for the Fever series.  There are dazzling twists and turns, which flip the story 180 degrees more than once.  Mac 5.0, having transformed herself over and over, encounters misery beyond reckoning, the answer to her heart's prayer, and then the two switch places.  Stunning revelations, agonizing angst, war between races.  Take the phone off the hook, cancel your appointments, and dive in.
B00006LPER|1.0|This movie was crap.  It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s.  It is boring and merely a poorly filmed interpretation of the lustful quest for dominantion.
1401310400|5.0|I enjoy the characters and the mysteries on the television show.  same with the book.  great read for mystery and fans of series characters.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|you know the plot and it's still a great movie because it's a fear we all have. not one of the greatest movies but a thriller that is nail biting especially in the dark. ryan reynolds gave a fantastic performance in this movie and deserves alot of recognition for this role.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|tis is a good sharpener... not great but good. and for the price (got for 6.50 at walmart)i would rather sharpen my knives by hand or sent them in to be honed but honing is pricey after the 8th knife you send in and i have way more than that, and buying your own stoned is also a good amount of money and allot to learn. this product works great in the field and when i can't get my hands on a friends stones (i have also used river stones that worked better but it's frozen right now) in short this is a great product my only real complaint is that the straited knife sharpener is to coarse but thats ok because i don't own any straited blades other than stake knives (i HATE straited blades)    it is also easy and fast and i have to admit that is really the only reason i got it
0307454541|5.0|At first, I didn't think I was going to like the book because it was a slow starter.  Once I got used to the names and places I was not familiar with, I loved the book.  You will not put it down!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I don't think I've ever looked forward to a book like I did this one and it didn't disappoint.  All my questions were answered and I was very happy with how everything turned out in the end.  I am looking forward to her next series. . .now, what am I going to read while I wait?
B003EY7IRC|5.0|So many twists and turns to get to this point, and I assure you, this book was well worth the wait. It's beautifully written and the prose of the first chapter is heartbreaking. I felt it, Mac's emotions, her misery, and cried for and with her. It was one of those moments where the author manages to completely suck you into the tale. I still get chills over that first chapter.    So many more twists and turns in this book that I contemplated putting it down several times out of annoyance, but each twist, each turn, had a purpose.     I wish there had been more elaboration in the last chapter, more words on the changes and those to come. Overall, another wonderful book that I couldn't put down from the second I purchased it. I seriously spent all day lounging in Mac's world. :)    All of my fingers and toes are crossed that Moning starts a new series for Barrons'... guys/fellow monsters.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|It's back to basics and a return to form for Colin Meloy and his Decemberists. The last two albums (Hazards of Love and The Crane wife)were bold attempts at broadening the scope and sound of the band's music. Somewhere along the way the band lost a bit of the magic and charm that made Smiths fans think that there might actually be worthwhile music in the twenty first century.<br /><br />The new album, The King is Dead, strips away the excess (prog-rock, concept rock and corporate rock) and just strums one away with acoustic guitars, pretty melodies and good writing. This album is probably closest to my favorite, Castaways and Cutouts. There are however major differences: fiddles, steel guitars and harmonicas swell among an americana sound. Folk great Gillian Welch sings back up with her distinctive voice raising the quality of the music to soaring levels. REM guitarist, Peter Buck adds his jangling flair to several of the tunes (Calamity Song mimics the Reckoning era with 12 string indie perfection.)<br /><br />Colin still pushes his writing to that fine line between brilliance and pretentiousness. Words like great come out Geereaat when his sings them. He uses words that his university educated audiences have never heard of (like trillium, excuse me, i mean tereeleeumm.) Meloy has the ability to sweep us away from the confines of the real world. Those Smiths fans I mentioned earlier might feel like checking a calender when listening to The Decemberists. Their music and lyrics make one think of the nineteenth century with images of seasons, harvests and storybook characters firing the imagination. The king may be dead, but here, the song reigns supreme.<br /><br />Colin and his band-mates do what they do best: create stories. The track, Rise To Me contains one of the loveliest melodies you'll ever hear. January Hymn is a stunning ode to winter. This is Why We Fight makes one think he's ready to fight for a just cause. Avery's song softly ends the album by putting the listener's feet back on the ground. But fear not, the magic still surrounds and abounds...n the ground. But fear not, the magic still surrounds and abounds...

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I won't go over the storyline except to say that this is the last book in a series, so start at the beginning before reading SF. I have been waiting a long time for this book, and was not dissapointed. KMM outdid herself and I loved the resolution for all the great characters. The storyline was fantastic and she tied up all loose ends to make it a very satisfying read.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out in the 70's and listened to it all the time.  It's one of my all time favorites.  Boston has such a unique sound and I love the great guitar licks.  Beautifully remastered......I'm totally enjoying it.  When my teen age kids heard it playing in the car they were like \\"who is this, they are awesome.\\"  Can't beat that good ole' classic rock-n-roll. I'm thrilled to have this in my collection again.
B0018QQQKS|3.0|I chose this book because I was looking for a historical perspective on economies and markets, and this book delivered in spades.  Going back over several hundred years, the author does a very thorough job in demonstrating that the challenges we face today, are not much different than many times in history.<br /><br />I think the big lesson in all of this is the recognition that history does tend to repeat itself over time and with this simple knowledge we can all make better financial decisions.<br /><br />As the saying goes, if you do not learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />This book gave me what I was looking for at the time.  It then gave me a great perspective when reading other books on the subject.  I think its an important read for anyone interested in the historical perspective of the economy and the markets and provides an important base of knowledge that can be applied throughout your life for years to come.
0385341679|5.0|In a word....brilliant!  The entire series start to finish had me on the edge of my seat.  Once I started a book I was compelled to complete it the same day.  I haven't found another series that has completely taken over my days like this series has.  Thank you KMM, you gave me so much more then I ever could have thought possible.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I've owned both copies of the Love Actually soundtrack now, and I'm happy to report that this edition comes complete with the \\"Christmas is All Around\\" track by Billy Mack from the movie! This track is difficult to find, iTunes doesn't even carry it, so I was very pleased to find it on this CD for sale here on Amazon.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite CDs to pop in no matter what mood I'm in. And if you love the movie as much as I do, you'll adore having this soundtrack to listen to. This would also make a great gift for any friend or loved one who is a fan of the movie.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I didn't quite know what to expect with Shadowfever, but what I got was fabulous. I guess I had doubted that KMM could pull every string together and give a completely satisfying ending to a great series. I was very happy to be proven wrong, she grabbed every string and added more, the result was a riveting UF story that kept it's thread of romance.    I came into the Fever series from the Highlander series, and as a straight romance fan. Darkfever and UF was a departure for me but I loved it and was willing to follow this new avenue of writing from KMM. If I look at Shadowfever from my original perspective, that of a romance book lover, I'd have some issues. I'd want to kick Mac a few times and I'd want to know Barron's a lot better.    But since romance has never been what this series was intended as, I'm thrilled with the story and the conclusion that Shadowfever brought me.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|UPDATED INFO<br />Since posting my original \\"FYI\\" review (see below), \\"Steely\\" responded with info which proved my review to be wrong. I have tested this \\"how to\\" with my ION USB with Vista \\"fixed\\" as per his info and the result is stereo, so yes, you can record stereo from USB devices. I would not have easily found this info if I had not posted my incorrect review. Sometimes being wrong helps find the right info; here is Steely's \\"how to\\" as submitted by him (and I've updated from two stars to five).<br />--------------<br />Steely says:<br />Maybe this will help. I more or less lifted these instructions from an Audacity page on USB recording:<br /><br />Windows Vista and 7<br />Stereo recording<br /><br />External devices such as USB turntables usually default to mono recording on Windows Vista and 7. This means that if you are recording a stereo LP, only one channel of the LP will be transferred, and this will be duplicated in both channels of the track. To record in stereo:<br /><br />1) Right-click over the speaker icon in the System Tray > Recording Devices. Alternatively, click Windows Start > Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Sound, then the \\"Recording\\" tab (in \\"Classic View\\", there's a direct link to \\"Sound\\" in the Control Panel).<br />2) Right-click over USB Audio Codec and hit Properties<br />3) On the \\"Advanced\\" tab, in the \\"Default Format\\" section, change the dropdown menu to \\"2 channel 16 bit 44100 Hz\\"<br />4) If the input is too loud or distorts, also click the \\"Levels\\" tab in \\"Sound\\" for the USB Audio Codec and move the slider to the left. (Plankwing says, I had to set the volume level at 25 to prevent clipping).<br />--------------<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />So here is the skinny on this turntable. It works great as a plug-and-play with USB ... for monophonic output. It does not output stereo using the USB connector.<br /><br />I have a Stanton turntable, currently to computer via Numark DJ Mixer. I wanted a more simple hookup because my desktop computer sound system works only randomly and no solution has been found. I got this to record with my laptop and bypass the unreliable desktop sound. This is literally \\"plug and play\\" and works without any futzing. As for recording, I don't use the software included with this device; I have and use SoundForge and this device works perfectly with it. The problem is, the USB hookup does not transfer in stereo, converts both L/R to identical \\"mono\\" tracks. Note that it also has stereo RCA out but the caveat is that turntable output is not generally compatible with computer line-in. If connected directly to line-in, one risks blowing out the sound card. I.e., a DJ Mixer or similar device should be used to make the turntable output compatible with computer line-in.<br /><br />In fact, ION does admit that USB is mono only, but their language does not make that fact obvious. Here are two quotes from the Amazon page for this turntable:<br /><br />\\"The belt-driven PROFILE LP features ... a standard RCA output (in addition to the USB port) for use with normal stereo setups.\\" Note the \\"STANDARD RCA ... FOR ... NORMAL STEREO SETUPS\\"! What is not stated is that the USB hookup is mono and not a \\"normal stereo setup\\"!<br /><br />\\"Audacity (PC and Mac) is intended for the advanced user. This application allows for advanced audio editing and processing, such as normalization, noise removal, 78 RPM speed conversion, and automatic track separation.\\" Note the \\"AND AUTOMATIC TRACK SEPARATION\\"! What is not stated is that ANY program that will record in stereo will separate the R/L tracks as \\"normal stereo\\" IF the RCA connectors are used. In fact, if any program that will record in stereo is used with the USB port, the result will be identical R/L tracks so that someone who is not familiar with what wave files look like could mistakenly believe they have a stereo recording. Caveat emptor.<br /><br />I am now using it with USB solely for 78s (at 45rpm then time/frequency shifted to 78 with SoundForge), 45s, and non-stereo LPs for which it works great. So why have I not just hooked it up via RCA > DJ Mixer > laptop? Ummmm ... bummer ... my Stanton went fritzy, only outputs L; haven't found the fix yet.<br /><br />Back to reality. If you want to get stereo out of this turntable, I suggest you acquire an inexpensive device such as a DJ Mixer and connect to your line-in port. NOTE that ION's RCA to USB adapter that converts turntable out to USB in (which I also have) does NOT have RCA out so it is mono only. For that reason, it does not substitute for a DJ Mixer.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br />I found the problem with my Stanton; a quick-connect to the cartridge carrier had come loose. So, two turntables, one for stereo, one for mono. Twice the fun, right?!RCA > DJ Mixer > laptop? Ummmm ... bummer ... my Stanton went fritzy, only outputs L; haven't found the fix yet.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This series is excellently done. It's moving and gives those of us who knew very little about most of the Pacific battles an understanding of what went really on. Without any gratuitous sex, blood and gore, it depicts the horrendous level of all that stuff realistically and helps the viewer understand why those who went through it can't talk about it.
1563899426|5.0|I am a HUGE Fables fan.  I started reading Fables a bit after it first came out and I was hearing the buzz about it.  I know this is supposedly sacrilegious, but it was really the James Jean covers that put me off at first.  I thought that was what the interiors would look like and that's not really my cup of tea.  I started with Volume 1 Legends in Exile right here and never looked back.  The art by Medina is great in this first volume, but wouldn't you know it?  It actually gets better with Mark Buckingham (who does almost every issue after this initial volume).  I can't believe that I actually started by talking about the art in this collection when we all know that as insanely good as that is, the brilliance that is Fables sprang forth from the mind of Bill Willingham.  I almost get teary eyed thinking about how much he's given to so many people with this story.  It's amazing.  I own over 30,000 comics and there's no doubt in my mind, Fables is my all time favorite read.  In this specific collection, yes, you only get 5 issues, but I think the price reflects that to an extent, and you're not paying the same you would for Volume 10, which contains 10 issues.  I can't say enough great things about this book, buy it right now and you won't regret it.  This collection introduces you to modern day incarnations of these fairy tale characters with adult sensibilities.  It gives you a murder mystery that absolutely plays fair with you.  The clues are there, if you're keen enough to pick up on them.  And most of all, it starts building a world that you absolutely get swept up in and devour volume after volume of.  Take it from me.  I've given my trade paperbacks to no less than about 5 people who had never read a comic book in their life and they quickly asked for every subsequent volume after having this one for one night each.  One of these friends liked it so much, that I was able to convince him to do a comic book podcast with me, and, at the time, this was the only comic book he had ever read.  So, of course, we started with this story.  If you'd like to check it out and see what we thought in even more detail, come visit us at [...].  Be forewarned, though, this was the first podcast that we had done, so it was definitely rough.

0307454541|4.0|The book begins with a mystery of an annual gift to a very old man and moves forward warp speed. Once you're hooked, forget about the dishes, the laundry, the vacuuming; a solid romp into a mystery only partially solved by the end of Volume I of Larsson's trilogy. I was not familiar with his previous work or that there was any - only that I felt compelled to jump into Volume II as soon as I could get my hands on it.<br /><br />The author's particular talent was in making you care deeply about the characters; he is not a literary writer and through translation, I think some nuances may have been lost; however, you read on and on to find out what happens to your new friends:  Swedish journalist  Mikael Blomkvist and the boy/girl genius, Lisbeth Salander who causes him so much frustration and yet saves his neck time and again.<br /><br />Although he is almost twice her age, I do believe Blomkvist has fallen for the elusive and brilliant computer hacker who allows almost no one into her life. Because of intimated violent abuse as a child and some obscene sexual abuses as grown woman which can be a bit off-putting, you cheer her on with her every act of retribution in order to find some semblance of justice in her life. She is quirky, introverted, suspicious and dangerous and more than a little wary of the friendship Mikael offers her.<br /><br />Be prepared for an entertaining and well told thriller from Sweden that veers occassionally into scenes of violence and sadism.
B00118X2VY|5.0|Lyra and Will are back and still trying to find a way to Lyra's father, Lord Asriel. Lord Asriel's war is fully underway, but the final and decisive battle is still to come. Lyra and Will meet Mary Malone, a friend made in Will's earth, in yet another version of the world. (The jumping around sounds much more confusing that it actually is in the book.) Mary must help them find a way to understand dust and save all the worlds in existence.    Lyra is a character I will always love. She is so realistic to me it's frightening. Will is a bit to steadfast for my taste...almost too stubborn and to be real at times.    I hate to say too much about the plot and ruin it for people who have not yet read the first two. This was a fantastic end to a series. I was sad to see it stop, but completely happy about the way it did. Not all the strings were tied off nice and neat, but that's life, messy. All the plot lines were wrapped up in a way that allowed the characters to have resolution and a continuing purpose beyond the end of the story.    The twists and turns were numerous, but all made sense as they occurred. They were also spaced out in a way that made the story seem more real and believable.    5/5
B003UESJHO|3.0|This was a really rousing movie for the first 2/3rds or so.  The characters were interesting, the acting and the plot were all great.  Then it lost its way a bit as it geared up for the climax which was a bit anti-climactic.  Still, a good, realistic and gritty look at boxing.
B000FCK8ZK|1.0|after watching the series dexter on showtime, i was anxiously anticipating reading the books that inspired such a good show. this book however is not worth the time or paper. it lacks character development and leaves the reader somewhat confused about what dexter morgan is feeling. rarely have i ever felt more jipped by a book than a show, but here is one instance. it feels like a book for fourth graders except the morbidity of the killings and the cussing at the most unconvincing times.
1897093616|1.0|I read the first 40 pages or so and it didn't grab me.  The narrator isn't described, there's no texture, no detail.  It just jumps into the story too quickly and I didn't feel anything about the characters or interest in the plot.
0316077054|5.0|If you've read my review for BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, the first book in the CASTER CHRONICLES series, you will know that I gobbled up that book like delicious cake. Therefore, when I discovered ARCs of Book #2 at the ALA Annual Conference, I may have squealed with glee and snatched a copy greedily. (Okay, so I did.) Afterward, I lovingly squirreled away the book as a special treat for when I finished my revisions on my own novel. That didn't last very long.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS is 512 pages, a fact that alarms me when I consider that I read the book in two sittings. I couldn't help myself, though, because the story wormed its way into my imagination even when I was doing mundane activities like eating cereal or watching TV. If you haven't read Book #1, go read my review for that. If you have read Book #1, then continue reading this review for Book #2.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS satisfies my need for:<br /><br />(1) Twisted magic that draws upon voodoo and curses from the Civil War. Also, twisted magic in the hands of a likely dangerous girl, rather than a ubiquitous brooding guy.<br /><br />(2) Romance. But not easy-peasy, standard-issue, star-crossed \\"we must be together every second of our waking existences!\\" romance, the bittersweet kind that involves people getting pissed and not talking to each other for realistic reasons.<br /><br />(3) New characters who are just as crazy fun as the last batch. Though I will admit to liking the new L better than the old L. (Shhh! No spoilers.) Just because the new L is fabulous.<br /><br />(4) More exploration of the South and its patchwork of cultures. For example:\\"Decorating graves was another one of Gatlin's contests--a way to prove that you and your family members, even the dead ones, were better than your neighbors and theirs. People went all out. Plastic wreaths wrapped in green nylon vines, shiny rabbits and squirrels, even birdbaths, so hot from the sun they could burn the skin right off your fingers. There was no overdoing it. The tackier, the better.\\" I adore paranormal fiction well-rooted in reality.<br /><br />I will stop this review right here, since I don't want to tread into the realm of spoilers, and believe me, BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS is chock-full of twists that you will just have to discover on your own.<br /><br />(I got this as an ARC from ALA, if you didn't see that above.)dore paranormal fiction well-rooted in reality.

0385341679|5.0|I've never done a review on here...but Shadowfever was amazing.  I promptly bought my ebook night of Jan. 18 and started reading the next morning.  And then I ran to the store to buy my hard copy of the book, just so I could have the lovely book in my hands!  Many people have mentioned how torturous it was to wait a year for the final book 5 to the Fever series.  I remember reading book 4 and I could not believe the cliff hanger!  I fortunately got to the reading of this epic Fever series only in November 2010!  I stumbling literally across it as I was looking from some books to read on my December holidays.  Wow was I taken for a roller coaster ride.  I was hell bent on getting my hands on every book in the Series and luckly because I was late to the game I only had to wait about 3 weeks fro the release of Shadowfever!    The twists and turns in these books are unparallelled to books I've read before...it goes at lightning speed and Shadowfever is no different.  This last book answered questions pertaining to many raised during the series - I won't spoil it with too many details here.  However it also left me with wanting to know more about the new world that came away from this series.  It left me with wanting to know the \\"ever after\\" with Mac and Barrons, as Mac still leaves you with a few lingering questions.  It raised a whole new question of how Barron's and his group of 8 came into existence.  The book describes what they are, but does not go into detail of the myth & legend of how they came to be...I see another book coming for this, or at least being explored in KMM's next series.  Shadowfever left me with wanting more, know more, live more in the world that KMM built.  Brilliant writer.  KMM has a gift of taking you into an enchanted world that allows you to escape reality.  Passionate, smart, witty, funny, sexy, adrenaline rush - drags emotions out of the characters with realism and takes you along for a great ride. It makes you want more and hope that this world she build never ends.  I loved every moment of Shadowfever and hope she continues to write with the same passion for the next series!  Bring It On!
B00000J7RZ|2.0|I've always liked J.Lo. I mean yes, I know she can't really sing or act but there is something about her I like. Which is why I got this album. With all the hype around this album I thought it was going to be amazing but it's not. Out of 12 tracks (I'm not counting No Me Ames ballad version or Una Noche Mas because it's just Waiting For Tonight in spanish) only 5 of the songs are good.    1. If You Had My Love  2. Feelin' So Good  3. Lets Get Loud  4. Waiting For Tonight   5. It's Not That Serious    Everything else is weak and forgettable and sounds like the same song just with words in different places. Singing ain't for her
1439107955|5.0|The author has surprisingly good writing skills for a doctor. It is an easy read for both specialists and people without any background in cancer treatment. I would recommend it to anybody involved in any remote way in what is called the \\"fight against cancer\\" which after reading this book should be called \\"the fight to avoid our bad habits\\".
B00005UW9T|1.0|I'm confused. This is the second disc I've tried (already returned one with the same problem) and it doesn't play on my DVD player. It works on my laptop, but not my Panasonic DVD player. any ideas??
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I have followed The Allman Brothers Band as well as Gregg's own solo efforts since the mid seventies. I had the date circled on my calander ; 01/18/11 when Gregg's new release was finally coming out. I purchased the CD and put it in the system.... and couldn't help but be disappointed. T Bone Burnett's '' stamp / sytle '' is all over this to the point where the music it is just too dark sounding / muddy and and not defined.....dull is a word that comes to mind. Gregg's vocals are top notch, but the choice of song's ( influenced by Burnett ) are good but was expecting more but in my opinion. Compare this to ; '' Searching for Simplicity '' which I thought was very good and you will see what I mean. That recording was crisp / clear the instruments were dynamic and focused and the overall music was enjoyable and Gregg's voice was well recorded. The choice of band in this recoding just doesn't seem to be a good fit......sorry, I just may be the only one who feels like this but the music is just tooooo dark sounding and muddled to be enjoyed. Too bad as with a different producer this could be allot better.
0451196716|5.0|One of the best Stephen King books I've read so far. It kept me fully engrossed in the story and greatly held my interest. The ending - WOW! It came as a surprise and I don't know if I was disappointed or not, but was thrilling, none the less.<br /><br />If you are a \\"Hunger Games\\" fan or love dystopia, you'll certainly enjoy this book!
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I have the individual seasons and am very happy about them.   No need to buy the box set, and certainly won't after reading these reviews.  What a slap in the face to W/G fans, and that's kind of unacceptable.  Has anyone considered writing the stars of the show? I'm assuming they  would want to know their fans are being treated with such indifference.
030746363X|5.0|The book has many good points. I really like the way the author plays test subject. All in all a good reference to get you started in weight loss.
B001E45XT4|3.0|Im not bashing these headsets, for the price its a good deal, but the construction could be a little more fortified especially where the headphones slide in and out for adjustment. The sound quality really could be alot better but its respectable, not a lot of bass with these, dont expect it. Im happy with my purchase, anyone on a budget should consider these, they are not that bad at all.
B004G606K8|5.0|This book will remain one of my favorite's. It has a lot of different characters that create a bond together and triumph in the end against an evil trying to take over the world of Krynn. You will have to read all three books in this trilogy to get the whole story. Other than that it is a simple fantasy created through a gaming system.
0439023491|2.0|Only die-hard fans of [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] will think this sequel does much more than repeat the action of the first book (and really, who else would read it? - so I'm sure my opinion is very unpopular). The protagonist Katniss once again finds herself and Peeta in a televised fight to the death, but this time she is the unwitting symbol of the resistance movement. Almost all potential for character development or plot advancement is used up in violent action sequences.<br /><br />Like many, many (MANY) sequels, I was left feeling that the first book should have been left alone. For a great story about an unwitting revolutionary leader, read [[ASIN:0765318237 Moving Mars: A Novel]].
B002RKSCA6|5.0|I just read this classic for the first time ever and I simply loved it.  I have seen live theatre of various adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde, as well as the movie, but none have ever done justice to this story.  I was actually surprised by the true story-line.  It was a little cumbersome (a lot of run-on sentences, long paragraphs, intense visualizations) at times, but it's a classic for a reason! It took about 2 days to read and although not terribly suspenseful, it was exciting to see Jekyll and Hyde fight to the death.    I am reviewing the Kindle Edition of \\"The Strange Case...\\" which was well-formatted and easy to read.  There were no typos or mistakes in the print.    Excellent!
030746363X|5.0|Why have you not got this already? Seriously. Outstanding book by Timothy Ferriss with fascinating \\"hacks\\" on fat loss, muscle gain, being superhuman and amongst a host of other things... 15 minute female orgasms. Yes, really.    Here is bit more detail of why I like it:    Two weeks prior to the public release I got my hands on a copy of the 4 Hour Body.    Being a spokesperson for a rocking company and a fitness guy with an email list sometimes has its benefits. Besides, it was my birthday.    I dived in. Now I know a thing or two about training, but I loved some of the super efficient hacks, many of the ideas I have NEVER heard before.    One idea alone CHANGED me: I lost 8lbs the first week (198 to 190), and in the second week, changed gears and in the two week period added 40lbs to my 3 rep maximum deadlift.    Total workout time: 2 hours.    Run, don't walk, to grab this book.    Tim hacks nearly everything - fat loss, stacking on muscle, sleep, better sex, becoming superhuman and does it all in humorous style.  Most importantly for you and me, is that Tim once again takes something very complicated and distills it down to its most efficient, simple core.    Better yet, he has data to back it up.    1000 plus blood tests, thousands of hours of experimentation. Heck, when I saw him in Nicaragua he had a glucose monitor embedded in his side.    Freaky? Maybe. But the results are there for the taking. I marched off and bought three more copies before christmas to give to loved ones.     I unequivocally recommend very very few things....    I absolutely and unequivocally recommend this book.    I know you will love it. Enjoy.
B000002KHF|5.0|With Van Morrison you never knew what you'd get. He became pretty hit or miss as he progressed later in his career. And...I saw him once in concert and his complete lack of interest in what he was doing really disappointed me. But, I gather that he is a guy who likes things on his own terms; take him or leave him. He writes and records what he wants and not what others expect of him. Some times that approach works out well and other times not. The early 70's was kind to him and some of his best work comes from this period; most notably \\"Moondance\\". The title track could be considered his most recognizable song but 'Caravan', 'Crazy Love' and 'Into the Mystic' all rate as highly. A very consistent excellent record and one that never wears out it's welcome.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 has produced two very impressive albums over the years; \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\". The latter one is simply their best album...period...bar none...case closed. There is really not much need to discuss the merits of the individual songs because they are all excellent. Unlike other records where certain songs make up the higher points this record flows from one song to the next without giving up a thing.   One of the amazing aspects of this record is that in 1991 it reflected a major change in the group's musical style and was a pretty risky move for a band that was still having incredible success from the 80's. No longer fixated on American society the band embraced its European roots and took on a sound more in line with what was going on in clubs across that continent. This album saw them kiss goodbye to everything they had done in the 80's and pointed them in a new direction. The results stand as their true high water mark with no other U2 album achieving this much consistency and innovation at the same time. Okay, I can't do this without picking one song...\\"\\"Mysterious Ways\\" is my favorite U2 track of all time.
1439177783|2.0|I won't say that I hated this book as some reviews have stated but I can say that I was dissappointed by it.  It starts with such promise as PD allows us to \\"hear\\" how a obsessive anorexic/bulimic mind works.  Somewhere in the middle it became so repetitive that you end up getting lost in the obsessiveness of it all.  Perhaps this was to make her case regarding how low her self esteem was.  Okay..but there is no revelation about what put her on her better path.  Are we to believe that a A/B mind that works the way that she outlines how her mind worked just ups and decides thru sheer will power and the love of a good women that she is now well?  At the end I felt as if she was deluding herself that she was all better now and that she had taken that obession and placed it in another direction.   There is a beginning to this book but there just doesnt seem to be a middle or an end.
B000LC55F2|3.0|The first time I saw the movie I hated it because I figured out some of the twists and then felt bored as they came to be revealed.  On second viewing, this is a good movie when viewed as the duality of good and evil in everyone, and how our motivations of our actions are more important than the actions themselves.
1594202842|4.0|This book is Amy Chua's story about raising her daughters \\"the Chinese way.\\" Chua explains how she was relentlessly strict with her daughters in order to get them to excel at school and music. She contrasts her method with \\"the Western way\\" of raising children. This contrast existed even in Chua's own family, as her husband Jed often disagreed with her methods: \\"I was already at a disadvantage because I had an American husband who believed that childhood should be fun.\\"<br /><br />Personally, I do not agree with Chua's harsh practices (including calling her children \\"garbage\\" and threatening to burn all their toys). Chua's descriptions of her daughters' punishing music practice schedules made me cringe, especially considering the girls had very little time, if any, to explore other interests and friendships with their peers. Fortunately, Chua learned to lighten up by the end of the book, but the first 150 pages are difficult to read. I feel sorry for Chua's children.
B00448SE4S|4.0|First off, this movie could really annoy certain people - if you feel that having video game graphics inserted into a movie, then this probably will not be the movie for you.    However, for everyone else, this flick was certainly worth using my free VOD amazon credits on.  The movie makes fun of itself, and is just a joy to watch.  I love the 3rd villian - Go Vegan Power!  And the soundtrack is good to boot as well!  enjoy!
0307463745|1.0|As a business owner and aspiring entrepreneur, I was really looking forward to this book based on the editorial reviews from people like Cuban and the Zappos dude, but I could not have been more disappointed.  Let me save you some money and I'll summarize the book for you:<br /><br />\\"Hey, being blind didn't stop Stevie Wonder!  Stop complaining!  Get to it and kick a$$!\\"<br /><br />That's the crux of this book and its approach.<br /><br />The rest of it is spent with these guys boasting about how awesome they are.  It really was disappointing.  Even the remotely useful parts like \\"meetings are toxic\\" or \\"focus on strengths and ignore weaknesses\\" are old lessons already these days and well known, which you can hear anywhere.<br /><br />There was no practical advice whatsoever as far as actual concrete steps toward establishing a start up, budgeting, marketing, etc.  Only semi-motivational rah rah nonsense like \\"find a way to do it cheaper!  We did!\\".  Thanks guys, real brilliant insight.<br /><br />And then they like to sprinkle in little things like \\"we made $1 million with this book!\\".  Which really... is just juvenile and insipid.  They come off sounding more like a couple spoiled punks rather than any kind of renegade trailblazers or anything.<br /><br />If you are looking for a motivational business book I would highly recommend Harry Beckwith's books (Marketing the Invisible, etc.) as a much better, more palatable read, even though they are 10+ years old by now.<br /><br />This stuff from Fried and Hansson is just nonsense, and two guys patting themselves on the back.  Good for them.
0399230033|5.0|This is my daughter's all-time favorite book.      My daughter is mentally retarded and cannot read, but she thinks she can read this book.  I can't even count how many copies I've bought because she wears them out reading it over and over and carrying it everywhere (and the board book is very well-made - I would recommend that edition over the others).    The story is delightful, but the illustrations are even better.  It is fun to look for the balloon on each page, to notice the toys in the animals' cages and the pictures on the zookeeper's wall, etc.  Don't miss the neighbors looking out the window as the animals follow the zookeeper into the house and then later as the zookeeper's wife leads them back to the zoo!  One funny aside is that my daughter refers to the zookeeper's wife as \\"the deer\\" because the zookeeper says to her, \\"Good night, dear.\\"  Enjoy!    PS If your child likes this book, also look at [[ASIN:0142400246 10 Minutes till Bedtime]] which is set in the same \\"neighborhood\\" and features cameos by the gorilla and the little mouse.
0385341679|5.0|I have read all the books in order - and waited for this one anxiously. I was not disappointed.  I LOVED it! Just started it again for round two.  I can't recommend this book enough.

B003EY7IRC|3.0|Like many others, I have read all of KMM's books. This series could have been put into three books. I am trying not to give anything away, but there are still many questions not answered and if you aren't looking very very close through all the un-needed soup, you want get what many answers are (i.e. what is Mac? How her sister really died? Barrons....?). By the time I got to the last two chapters, I felt it was rushed and there was a lot of BS about the Unseelie King and what Mac was. It got confusing. Glad I got it by Kindle for 9.99 or I would have been mad. The way this series was done from start to finish was disappointing. I hope the next book she puts out is written and edited like her other books. This could have been a great series, but it got blown.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Love what Disney has done with the Little Mermaid tale, in particular the change to a happily ever after ending (in the original she turns to foam, at least that's what I remember) that being said, the transfer to DVD is not up to Disneys high standards, not really bad just not as good as one has come to expect from Disney, never the less I highly recommend getting this disc, hopefully Disney will come out with a BLU-RAY edition, till then this isn't bad, enjoy the story and artistry of the animators, a little film grain doesn't really distract from ones enjoyment

0316779237|5.0|I admit that this was the first book from Sedaris that I have read, and it prompted me to purchase more of his books.  It was given to me by a close friend, and it completely got me hooked!  The first chapter, was genius-something I feel almost anyone that has ever had a crappy job can relate to.  Sedaris puts a funny twist on the words, making me wish that I had thought those words myself.<br /><br />As far as wording, he is extremely creative, adding to his amazing thoughts.  He makes you think, laugh out loud, and want to share it with other people as well.  I remember over a year ago reading chapters out loud to my friends, and I even took this same book on the plane with me to Iraq (still here!) to take the edge off of leaving family and the long (16 hour!) plane ride.<br /><br />I have since passed this book on to another friend that I felt needed a good laugh, and hopefully got him hooked as well.<br /><br />To the people that are offended for some reason by this book:  It is sarcasm.  Not serious.  The author is simply making light, using fantasy situations and wit.  If you can't take a joke, then maybe this book isn't for you.  If it bothers you, it is a simple concept to just not read it.
0307592839|5.0|Every story is connected in some way to one of the other stories. You might meet a character and then he or she will turn up somewhere else. Really interesting.
0316010669|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read - and I have been a voracious reader for most of my 55 years.  I bought this copy as a birthday gift.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|I think everyone should read this amazing mystery. Its kind of confusing for young readers, but is totally worth it in the end. What I did is I read the six page discription first, and even though it gives awa the whole book, it really helped me understand what was going on.

0061992860|5.0|(This is for the $7.99 small version)  I can't recommend this book enough.  It will fit well in your hiking bag, and could save your life.  All respects to Bear Grylls, yes even though he does have many controversial views for his show, his Book is much better.  TV shows are for ratings, and money, not education (for the most part).  Back to the focus of this review, I have this in my survival gear.  It is much lighter then it's \\"Bigger\\" brother; if you can carry it yourself, and you want it bad enough, carry what you want.  Expect no help from others in carrying your things.  Bare minimal, it is half to 3/4th's lighter, which can save a lot of trouble if you are a minimalist hiker/camper, etc.  Who could remember everything that they learned in survival class?  No one.  Lets be realistic about that.  When you get lost, a sense of panic can easy set in.  You'll forget any things at a critical time.  You'll loose much time trying to remember the basics, and remember when it might be too late.  They did a good thing in making a smaller version for your pack.  I think the smaller version, even though it has less information, will likely save more lives.  Doing anything for the first few minuets, after becoming lost, or separated, could be a life saver, providing it distracts you from being scared enough to loose your motivation to survive (90% of what you need by the way).   I would refrain in the most part; but will concede that the iPhone version would be good for when you are sitting in a theater or something, but lets face it.  Once your battery dies, that is it.  You could be in trouble.  Hands down Get this book, it could really save your life.
1591391105|1.0|Do not follow the advice of this book. It is partly abstract and generic and does not give you any informaiton. The basic information which is given is bad. I am completing my first 90 days and I wish I had never read this book.  It steered me in the wrong direction each time. If you are not careful, you can burn bridges early on and come across as abrasive. This book is no good. Zero stars.
031603438X|5.0|I don't have much to add to all the other reviews.  This is a terrific book that all Stones/Keith fans must read.  It solidifies Keith's place in history as a true rock & roll philosopher.  I couldn't put it down.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|I am enjoying the Hell out of this CD.  In my opinion it is different and unexpected enough that it all seems very new and fresh, yet old and blues like with a real American roots feel to it.  If you like any of Gregg Allman's solo music you should love this.  I think it stands high above a lot of his previous solo music and ranks right up there with much of the Allman Brother's music.  I have been a fan of the Allman Brothers since the mid 1970's and have seen them in concert several times and I atteneded Greg's New Bedford show on January 16th, 2011.  It is all good.
0345528581|5.0|There are enough exercises to work out every muscle group, and enough variations in each exercise to allow me to find my own edge and push it.

Because I can do these exercises without equipment -- except occasionally something I already have around, like a couple of books or a nearby shelf -- and because I don't have to go anywhere to do them, I have been able to stick to a daily regimen.  That's been critical for me.  There's never a day so busy that I can't find the time to do these.  My gym membership goes unused; my best-laid, ambitious exercise plans fell by the wayside.  But this I can stick to.  And I'm getting stronger and more buff and fit and feel better every day.    It just feels like the right combination of do-able, plus a genuinely good workout.  Highly recommended.
0061807400|5.0|Here's a piece of advice; if you haven't seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor and read the book first! I initially chose this title because of the hit movie, even though I've never actually seen it. I was expecting something in the horror genre, but what I got instead was much better...a psychological thriller with a twist that I never saw coming, even though all the clues were in plain sight.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels is a U.S. Marshall assigned to investigate a mysterious disappearance on Shutter Island, home to a hospital for the criminally insane. One of the patients, Rachel Solando, has escaped and it's up to Teddy and his new partner, Chuck Aule, to find Rachel before she harms herself or someone else. But as we quickly learn, that's only half the story. Teddy suspects that there is something more sinister happening on the island and he is determined to uncover the truth. Plus, he has an ulterior motive for taking this case, which quickly drives the plot in another direction and helps to shed some light on Teddy and Shutter Island itself.<br /><br />Astute readers may see the plot twist coming from a mile away, but Lehane managed to sucker punch me on this one and I loved every page of it. The dialogue is well written and although the book lags at times and takes a few bizarre turns (especially in some of Teddy's dream sequences), it captures and holds your attention throughout. Be warned that there is a lot of coarse language and sexual dialogue if you are easily offended by such things. All in all, this is a must read, whether you have seen the movie or not.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I am obsessed with P&P and this is by far the best version out there! The chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is incredible, and no other movie that I have seen (and I have seen them all) has ever come close! I watch this movie maybe once every one to two months and it never gets old. Buy this version if you love Pride and Prejudice, you will not regret it!
0143034901|5.0|...this one would be it. I never wanted it to end - I can't wait to read it again and I NEVER reread books since there are so many great unread books out there waiting to be read. But, this book is so beautifully written and translated, it begs to be savored over and over. Like a previous reviewer stated, the only downside to reading this book is dreading the end because you don't want the magic to ever end. You fall in love with the characters and the story is so completely compelling and fullfilling, that you'll lose lots of sleep reading this. I'm not going to try to describe the book's story because there is so much going on that I would never do it justice - just trust me that it's got it all and defies being classified as one genre: it's a suspense thriller, a tragic romance, a witty satire, a magical fantasy, a mystery full of twists and so much more. Just read it - you WILL love it.
1439107955|5.0|Fascinating book. Am a cancer patient for fifteen years and a retired physician who previously dealt with cancer. This puts it all together  and although the last (1/3) may get somewhat technical my wife read and really enjoyed the whole book. No, the topic of cancer cannot really considered enjoyable but the background given makes it so darned interesting and sets you up to follow what is happening with new developments.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I would rate this 10 stars if I could. I love how Karen was able to wrap it all up and have it end so perfectly. I wish the Highlanders could have had more than a few lines in this last book( b/c they were all so sexy in the Highlander series) but it was PERFECT!! I cried in the beginning with so much sorrow in my heart and then cried at the end with JOY!!<br />I hope the rumors are true and there will be more of the characters we have grown to love and respect in future books. I want MORE!<br />I can't say enough about how the Fever books made me FEEL. I lost my sibling and Karen is able to make you feel how terrible that loss is.Yet she allows Mac to grow to be so strong and keep going on. She is a superb writer and I will re-read all of her books many times :)
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Beautiful film. Wonderfully shot, haunting score. I'm particularly pleased with the use of practical effects, bringing a slightly more real tone to the scenes. Rockwell does a marvelous job portraying his character's multifaceted idiosyncrasies With equal parts stoic precision and comedic timing. It's not easy interacting with another you. Spacey as the charming and thoughtful robot voice was amusing. One of several nods to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Silent Running.    Not your typical epic blockbuster film by today's standards but I prefer this. It's an intelligent and interesting look at the human condition and morality with humor elements. Absolutely stunning jn blu-ray. A worthy addition to any scifi buff's library.
0385341679|5.0|After the long wait for book 5, I have to say that I am was not disappointed.  Reading Mac's transformation story has been amazing.  Mac 1.0 started out as a bubbly blond with no real goals in life who couldn't accept what was real and what was not .  Now, Mac 5.0 is sure of herself and seeks truth out no matter how wonderful she deems the lies to be.      I really enjoyed the revelations between Mac and Barrons.  While we still don't know exactly what Barrons is, KMM delves into his mindset and feelings (yes, he does have them!), which help us understand his POV and attitude towards Mac.  All characters stayed true to themselves and are wonderfully developed.      Seeing the Keltars appear made me tingle all over, and I have to say some of the interactions between them and Mac, V'lane, and Barrons was pretty amusing.  I'm pretty sure KMM had to be laughing during a certain argument between V'lane and Barrons.      Overall, great job.  I really want to see more of Mac (accompanied with her \\"old friend\\"/new pet?) and Barrons and cannot wait for the next spin off!  Thank you Karen!!  Thank you so Fecking much!!
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Just recently  found Diana Krall If you love your Jazz soft and sweet . This is the really deal. Got 4 or 5 CD's from Amazon.  When your setting on a interstate not moving. Put Diana on and you feel like ,the traffic is not so bad.
B000TERK3C|5.0|I am a rather new listener to Radiohead and I have to say, they rock! All of the songs on this album were new to me and after listening to it twice, I was hooked. Usually there are one or two songs on an album that you end up skipping over once you have heard it a bunch, can't say that's happened to me with this album!
B004FEWYXS|2.0|I'm glad he has a new album out, but I don't really like it. I don't think Michael jackson would have approved of it either. It's all wrong, from the album cover- which goes against his whole movement, to the songs. I love Michael Jackson so much. It's sad that Sony would do this to him. They knew he was about to leave them, he was about to give them 2 songs so he could leave them. He ended up hating Tommy Mottola (however you spell it), and he was saying how he is the devil and how Mj is going to own half of sony while producing his own music. He says for every album he made, he had atlease 120 songs of unreleased material. He is worth more dead than alive. Point blank period. However, since it is MJ's album, I like a couple of the songs, especially the ones that seem like he did. Some of the songs don't even sound like him. I don't have the CD, I? just played the snippets. I wish he could have worked with Quincy Jones again or just produced his own music. MJ was a perfectionist and he knew what the people wanted. But this album is better than nothing.   R.I.P. King of Pop, Michael Jackson

B004H8GLXQ|2.0|Got 3/4 of the way through and just did not have it in me to finish. Basically, I didn't care what happened. Can't believe I kept reading as far as I did--guess I wanted to like it. Kept waiting for something really interesting to happen. It never really did. Two stars for the fact I did get 3/4 of the way through. Next time I will follow my 100-page rule. Life's too short!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I am a huge nickelback fan, love their music, love this album and loved seeing them perform it in concert this year!!!
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie. As someone who worked for a video store for 5 years (and watched 5 movies a week) I have seen more films than usual! The story line is fantastically spiritual & emotionally charged- as one would expect from a tale about life after death. The visuals are absolutely stunning! There are vivid scenes in this are straight from imagination and executed with intense clarity. I have been waiting fit this to come out on blu-ray for years so I could watch it in HD!
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Being an Eagles fan from way back and having just been to one of their concerts I just had to have another copy of this album. I have worn certain tracks out so needed a new copy. Their voices may have aged like fine wine but are still true and wonderful to listen to.

Coincidence or fate? JUST PURE ACTING TALENT INHERITED FROM HER PARENTS (HER FATHER THE LATE Mr. TONY CURTIS). Not since the original PSYCHO starring Ms. JANET LEIGH, Ms. Curtis' mother in real life, had a film offered jolts of terror & send chills down the viewer's spine with a story that makes you care for all the characters onscreen. VISCIOUS MICHAEL MYERS PILES ON THE BODY COUNT AS NO OTHER KILLER HAS DONE IN FILM HISTORY SINCE NORMAN BATES!! And the masterful direction, screenplay & NOW A CLASSIC MOVIE SOUNDTRACK THEME also written by Mr. JOHN CARPENTER, only compares to the craft of Mr. ALFRED HITCHCOCK!!! Suspense,terror & unexpected story twists are in store rather than blood & guts as some people think. NOW ON BLU-RAY HIGH DEF & SOUND, ACCEPT NO IMITATIONS OR RE-MAKES- FRIENDS & I HAVE MADE IT A TRADITION TO WATCH IT EVERY YEAR IN OCTOBER - \\"IT'S HALLOWEEN, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO ONE GOOD SCARE\\"!!! TREAT YOURSELF TO A GEM OF A MOVIE!!!
B0012X6FR6|4.0|Any self respecting jazz fan knows that Bill Evans holds a special place in piano jazz history. His recordings are eloquent and soft spoken yet complex in design. If you have any of his albums it's likely that you listen to him while reading the paper or tidying the house, as a sort of white noise that can never really be white.     This album is no exception and it's appeal is in it's selections. Each track seems carefully selected and I can't stop listening to it and thinking that it was made just for me... but of course we know that isn't true.     Enjoy it.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|John Legend's voice is like butter.  The soul he is able to put into it is astounding.  Now, The Roots.  Just as amazing!  With their accompaniment, Legend's voice and piano the album transcends Rock, Blues, R&B, and Hip-hop.  (Yes, you get all of those in one album with seamless switching!)        Each song that is well written and perfectly produced with all ranges available.      If you don't by the album, and only purchase a couple of songs.  Make sure you get \\"I can't write left handed\\" and \\"Wake up.\\"  They are all good, but those two are possibly the best.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Wow!  What an outstanding concert presentation of this opera-like musical adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel \\"Les Miserables\\", which has been a worldwide sensation for over 25 years. This 25th anniversary concert, taped on October 3, 2010 before a wildly enthusiastic audience of several thousand at the cavernous O2 Arena in London, was simply superb--the production values (state-of-the-art lighting, audio, and video), the fantastic talent assembled on the stage, including performers from several companies--all in costume--and a huge back-up chorus all contributed to an amazing performance.     Notable among the cast were Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, Lea Salonga as Fantine, Katie Hall as Cosette, and Norm Lewis as Javert. Much unfair criticism has been heaped upon pop singer Nick Jonas, who plays the part of Marius, the young student who falls in love with, and eventually marries, Cosette. While his voice is not operatic (while the other cast members have such voices), his voice is nonetheless fairly good and with his boyish good looks, he is very convincing as the young idealistic student who becomes the love interest of Cosette.    The grand finale alone is the worth the price of the BD:  members of the original cast (and other previous and current cast members) sing duets and medleys, including four different Valjeans, all incredibly awesome. Their performance of \\"Bring Him Home\\" will bring tears to your eyes.     The Blu-ray Disc's video and audio are both excellent--you will not be disappointed in the sharp, pristine video and the impressive, full audio. If you have a surround-sound system, you are in for a real treat.     Also, this BD, which I ordered from Amazon.uk, is region-free:  It will play flawlessly on Region A (U.S. & Canada) Blu-ray players. I live in Allentown, Pennsylvania, USA--and this BD, which is not yet available on Amazon in the U.S., was a bargain, less than $23-US, including shipping.    This BD is a keeper--you will watch it over and over again.  Highly recommended!
0385341679|5.0|Shadowfever was so worth the wait, and I was sad to see it end!  Over the course of the series, Moning developed a complex and compelling world in which to tell her story.  The finale is like two books in one, considering its length.  Shadowfever did a great job of answering many questions about the identity of the fourth Unseelie Prince, the whereabouts of the Seelie Queen, Mac's and Barrons' relationship, and to some extent, Mac's beginnings and the Sinsar Dubh.  The inclusion of past characters from Moning's Highlander series was also interesting, and appropriately peripheral to the story.      Finally, Mac and Barrons got their act together, and really got together.  My disappoint with the earlier books, was that they spent too much time dancing around their attraction and growing feelings for each other.  Shadowfever takes the relationship full throttle.  Thank you KMM!    One of the underlying themes of the book is theological.  We see this with Moning's characterization and use of the Unseelie King, as a timeless monotheistic version of God, who is so omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent that our human minds cannot comprehend him in unified form.  This is very different from other Fae fantasy series that I have read.  Similar too is his creation of loved, but imperfect beings that he must both aid, control, and discipline.      What didn't satisfy?  More questions about Barrons and his band of fellow monsters!  However, I am sure that this was purposeful on Moning's part, and lays the foundation for future spin-offs from the Fever series.  I would enjoy learning more about the fates of certain characters like Ryodan and Dani \\"the Mega\\" in future works.    Can't wait for the next arc in the story!
0060935464|5.0|I am not going to bother reviewing this book.  Just read the first page and you are hooked up through the last line.  Then you simply savor Harper Lee's beautiful and tragic prose.    But why, WHY can I not have this on my Kindle?  Third party issue I suppose.  Hope Amazon gets it worked out.  This is very disappointing...
B004DMIIVO|5.0|In a world where Disney sucks the life and soul out of an avant-guarde, pre-cyberpunk, pre-Ghost in the Shell story in order to monetize it, comes a story of how the Second-Life world of Tron has really evolved and kept pace with the modern Internet, gaming and society.<br /><br />This is a story of how people's Avatars still play fighting games StreetFighter'ish, share their lives Facebook'ish, and blend the Internet world's reality and fiction on many levels. Yet, it's a world that bears a MCP's power to control lives in reality.<br /><br />At the same time, it is surprisingly, easily wrapped and connected into a communal, nostalgic, grass-roots, family, day-to-day lives between two maturing Japanese teens and their friends and family.
B004HEXSLI|2.0|Last year I had a brain aneurysm, not nearly so grave an event as what happened to Dr. Taylor, but briefly life-threatening and resulting in a hospital and rehab stay of over a month.  Some of what she writes parallels my own experience.  For example, some hospital caregivers, including those at the lowest end of the hospital pay chain, are among the most empathetic and encouraging people I've ever met.  They qualify as living saints.  Others were ham-handed and indifferent.  Also, being unconscious for an extended period, losing memory, is not a sensation of time, but rather of space and, often, of a great contentment and peace.  Like Dr. Taylor, I had anxiety-inducing effects from a long regimen of seizure-prevention medication.  It made me feel mildly buzzed and out of my skin all the time; I liked that OK sometimes, but more often I longed to be \\"myself\\" again, something that only started to happen once the medication was discontinued. It took me a year to more or less fully recover, which seems a paltry amount of time compared to Dr. Taylor's eight, but as I was experiencing it, I kept thinking, \\"why is this taking so long?\\"     So to the extent that I saw my own experience mirrored and validated, I found Dr. Taylor's book interesting.  Now for the bad news -- she is not a good writer at all and she skips over the details of her recovery (I would have loved, for example, to learn more of her struggle to learn how to do mathematical functions again) to concentrate instead of such things as speaking to her cells and lying in bed thanking them for a good day.  In the end, for me, it was a struggle to finish this book because of that lack of rigor in the reporting.

B003Y5H5JC|4.0|If you've been following the travails of Julie Taymor's Spiderman production for Broadway, you will understand them a little better once you watch the opening shipwreck scene in her version of The Tempest.  It is elaborate and detailed and far removed from the play itself, which of course opens with a brief onboard scene and then goes to Prospero and Miranda on shore for a long scene of explication of their exile on the island.  The genius in Taymor's take on the Tempest is to give us Prospera instead of Prospero and, especially, to give us Helen Mirren as Prospera.  She is wonderful as always, and convincing throughout.  I loved her delivery of the Act 4, Scene 1 \\"Our revels now are ended\\" speech that captures both the play and life itself in a few short lines.  The rest of the cast, Chris Cooper, Russell Brand et al, is uniformly excellent except the young actor who plays Ferdinand and who reads his lines like he is, well, reading his lines from a script held in his hands.  Taymor takes liberties with Shakespeare's text (the credits read something like \\"written by Julie Taymor based on a text by William Shakespeare\\") and Prospera's epilogue is a song over the closing credits, but overall this Tempest is in spirit faithful to the play and well worth seeing.
0385341679|5.0|I have been waiting for this book and it was worth the wait.   The best series of books I ever read and I can hardly wait for the Fever World books.  Thanks for writing this FANTASTIC series Karen!
1594202842|3.0|The hyperbole is very overblown.  There are parts that are very funny and completely honest.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this book was written too soon.  Her daughters are 16 and 13, I would be curious how they would have ended up in 10 years.  At under 200 pages this book feels light.<br /><br />The most hilarious part is when Amy is breaking down and asks her husband, \\"Don't you have dreams for Sophia and Lulu, don't you have dreams for Coco.\\"<br /><br />Coco is their intellectually challenged Samoyed dog.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Definitely not your typical musical, but definitely a must to see! Interesting that it is based on T.S.Eliot's poems that he wrote for his niece and nephew about different kinds of cats! The choreography is outstanding.  Their voices are all beautiful. The costumes are colorful and fantastic - no two are alike. Totally unique & enjoyable.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|Ben Affleck returns to the crime genre that served him so well with Gone, Baby, Gone; the result is character-driven action film featuring a knockout cast led by Affleck himself and a superb Jeremy Renner as bank robbers run amok in Boston. The film reeks of authenticity (one character from the film would say it's very authenticious). While lacking the emotional resonance of his first film, The Town still manages to make you care for the characters while providing some of the best action sequences of the year. The film hits all the expected beats - there's really nothing new here; but damn, it's well done. One of the better films this year. With Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite all joining in the drama. 4 out of 5 stars.
0385341679|5.0|*No Spoilers*<br /><br />This book may be one of the best and most satisfying series conclusions I have ever read. 600+ pages and you will still be begging for more. Moning weaved an ending so unpredictable and enjoyable that I cannot fault her for keeping us in the dark about a few characters, since there is more to come and she does so such a great job with tying-up the loose ends on a majority of the long list of mysteries she created throughout this series. The plot flow and wrap-up was so skillfully and methodically written, that it seemed rather seamless, without any force or feeling too contrived. And yes there is an HEA written in, but without an ounce of cheese factor, I might add.<br /><br />If you are already vested in the series and enjoyed the previous books, you will most likely love this one and be satisfied with this semi-ending.  I say Semi-Ending because, as the last line (\\"The End...For Now.\\") foreshadows a continuation.<br /><br />For those who were left peeved about the unanswered, you will be happy to know that there is a spin-off trilogy and graphics novel in the works that should address all these unanswered.<br /><br />What will next series be about?<br />A: Dani, Christian and Ryoden. Also, you'll see more of Mac and Barrons, too. She also said we'll learn more about the Triton Corp. and Mac will meet Tellie.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|Director Vincenzo Natali deserves some praise for the unconventional and thought-provoking science fiction/sexual horror exploits of Splice. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley give satisfactory performances, and the creature effects are convincing and, at times, downright disturbing. French actress and model Delphine Chaneacis is Dren, the genetically engineered creation of Brody and Polley's scientists. The film begins with a bang and continues along an interesting and enjoyable path until regrettably devolving into the standard horror chase film by the third reel. Worth seeing due to it's bizarre and disturbing themes, but don't expect much more. 3 out of 5 stars.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|As a younger viewer I never saw the original show. I began watching with Christopher Eccleston as the doctor and enjoyed the show very much. When David Tennant took over the reins I fell in love. After three magnificent seasons with Tennant heading the show I became dubious that anyone could step into the role and maintain the quality of the show. Enter Matt Smith; Smith is a very young actor who has the burden of playing a very old soul. It is easy to see the Doctor evolving from the serious Eccleston to the funny, but sometimes stern Tennant, to the almost effervescent Smith. Anyone who has watch since the beginning of the new series knows that this is due to his interactions with his companions, and this brings up to Karen Gillan's role as Amy Pond. Now I love Billie Piper in the role of Rose Tyler; she was strong, vulnerable, loving, and beautiful to watch. Amy Pond is nothing like Rose Tyler, but she is all of the things I have just mentioned and more. She's spunky, she's independent, and she knows she can pretty much make the Doctor do anything she wants him to. All in all, season 5 introduces some incredibly appealing characters, and some ridiculously fun story arcs, most notably to reintroduction of the character River Song, the mysterious character from season 4.    Season 5 is the first season I am purchasing because it's not available through my instant watch service yet. I had not really realized how much I loved this season until I found myself getting more and more excited as I got closer to season 5 when re-watching the series. It's a sneaky season that way.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|David Fincher has done what I privately deemed to be impossible. He has taken the seemingly moribund subject of facebook and crafted what is perhaps the greatest film of the year. Technically perfect, The Social Network follows Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg (a pitch perfect Jesse Eisenberg) through the inception and initial trials and tribulations involved in creating the social media site. This is all quite effectively told through Rashoman-style flashbacks during the course of two separate depositions. Fincher's films have always had style to spare and his usual brilliance, along with a fine cast including young Andrew Garfield and the surprisingly good Justin Timberlake, helps to create a mesmerizing tale of one man's rise to power during the dawn of social media. 5 out of 5 stars.
B00192IV9U|5.0|It is different from all the other stuff that he has done but is really great. Give it a chance you may find out that you really like it! Little more on the pop side and has some really good songs on it.
B00406UK7S|3.0|Neil Marshall has yet to recapture the magic he so effortlessly displayed with The Descent and unfortunately, Centurion is another missed opportunity. Offering his take on the fate of the mysterious 9th Legion of the Roman Empire, Marshall fills the screen with so much violence and gore that character development, plotting, and acting all seem to fall by the wayside. Michael Fassbender acquits himself nicely as the film's hero and Olga Kurlyenko makes an impression as the mute and deadly warrior on his tale. It sure looks nice and Marshall can film an action sequence with the best of them, but the material could have been so much more. Instead we get one long chase sequence, filled with Roman characters we don't care about who speak in an array of British accents. Worthwhile only for those with a strong bloodlust who wish to check their brain at the door. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Let me agree with the below reviews. I've always been adamant about the problems concerning the \\"reviewing\\" of products prior to their released. I do, however feel compelled to give the SW blu-ray release 5-stars, if only to add counter-weight to the people out there giving 1-star or the like to a product based on their own Star Wars conservatism. Jesus. I'll send you copies of my own low quality VHS-tapes, if that'll make you stop this unnecessary crusade against the new versions.. No one is forcing you to buy them, you know..
B002ZG98LO|2.0|File this one under \\"useless\\" sequel. Director Nimrod Antal and producer Robert Rodriguez essentially recycle every halfway decent idea from the original film with less than satisfactory results. The film tells the story of several mercenaries and killers dropped onto a an alien planet game preserve as they are hunted down by the title creatures. Plenty of people die, the visual effects are lacking, and the whole thing seems like a waste of time. Kudos must be given to Adrien Brody, however, for effectively conveying an action hero without the usually requisite tough guy build. Still, he's no Arnie or Carl Weathers. Through the film's runtime, I continuously found myself wishing I could just watch the original. 2 out of 5 stars.
B002ZCY7SW|2.0|Watching season 7 leaves you excited for season 8 considering how it ended but the writers try to avoid talking bout season 7 writer block probably lol :) I think it is as good as season 6 if not worse nothing really exciting here. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!)  I agree with people about liking the peace story no argument there killing off renee (sorry spoiler lol) a big let down so could of continued 24  in her own personal series lol I understand jack (Keifer Sutherland) is getting tired of 24 but renee could've carried the torch i feel the series (writers) are losing their touch this season seemed very predictable the  kidnappings and so on blah blah blah i admit its entrainment  just not as satisfying as the other seasons that is my opinion I do not get how people put this over other seasons i'd say believe it has an equal standing with season six but nothing more decent characters though not a very satisfying ending not too many 24 are though lol the stupid picture drone lol very funny but i guess this is the end all good things come to it.  All in the writers hands but i must say the really ruined the series with this season killing off renee ( i feel jacks pain lol ) I guess i have no choice but to enjoy the old seasons.  If you want a review to know if this is worth buying not really i wouldnt watch season 8 with high expectation cause the really isnt anything too amazing lol  season 7 is so much better was written pretty good but season 8 tries that all you can say. but if you insist on buying go for it   If you watch any other 24s you'll know this is crap and not worth 30 dollars i would say 10 bucks sorry 24 you got to do better :( (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!)

B00275EHJG|5.0|Woody and Buzz (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, as great as ever) are back in a near-perfect film that serves as the crowning achievement of what can now be called a classic trilogy. This time around, the toys end up in a preschool and must contend with unruly three year olds and tyrannical toys as they quest to return to their owner, the now college-bound Andy. In theaters, the film's 3D was a wonder, but it is little more than extra incentive to see this great adventure of heartfelt storytelling. The funniest and also most harrowing of the three films, Toy Story 3 is able to make a deep emotional impact while entertaining people of all ages. The only thing that keeps this final adventure for a perfect score is an overly schmaltzy ending, albeit an ending that had the majority of the theater in tears, and rightly so. It's been a great ride. 4.5 out of 5 stars.
0811875555|5.0|It took awhile for the book to reach me (almost 2 months). Turns out it was held by the customs agency. The wait was worth it though. An amazing amount of pre-production works inside the book! A great book to have for those who collect artbooks. :)

B0042U94UQ|2.0|I really can't think of an appropriate audience for this movie. There was a lot of bathroom humor which wasn't funny to me as an adult and really wasn't appropriate for young children. Ex: Photo copying butts? There were a few scenes that were actually funny and not bathroom related and the three orphans were pretty cute which is why I gave the movie a couple of stars. However, it wasn't worth my time or money.
1594202842|5.0|I think Dr. Chua is amazing.  Her effort into raising a high achievement kids serves a wake up call to me.  Long time ago, I gave up the idea of my kids growing up working even as half hard as I did because he was born in U.S and the school doesn't really value academic achievement as much.  Knowing what she did inspired me.  Now I asked myself what's wrong for my kids working as hard as I did in school?  Why can't he be excellent in every subject he is doing?  If it means as a parent, I need to put more effort into it, I am willing to do it.

0385341679|5.0|HOLY CRAP! What an epic adventure! With a much anticipated wait, Fever fans can finally rest as the 5th and final book to the Fever series has come to an end. Okay maybe it is up for debate if Fever fans can in fact rest and that this was the final book but I'll get to that later.    Shadowfever packs quite the punch. The book is chalk full of emotions, twist and turns, new and compelling characters, old and endearing characters, action, fantasy, and eroticism. \\"Shadowfever\\" starts right where it ended in \\"Dreamfever\\". The first few chapters are compelling and you will be on the edge of your seat anticipating which road Moning decides her character to go down. I have to confess, except for the first few chapters, I thought the beginning of the book was a little slow and nerve raking to read. I wasn't quite satisfied how she was playing things out. I read with a heavy heart those first 200 or so pages and started to doubt Moning wasn't going to be good on her promises. That she would deny her fans what they have been craving for. Don't fret though, she redeems herself quickly. The book picks up and takes off running.    We get introduced to new and intriguing characters, specifically Barrons' mysterious entourage. Moning fans also get to reunite with characters from her Highlander series; Dageus, Dregan, Cian and even Adam Black. Add Mac, Barrons, Rowena, Christian and V'lane to the mix and you get a very interesting dynamic. In fact I felt this was the highlight of the novel. I loved seeing all these characters interact with each other. It was great! I'm not sure what other readers will think about the older characters if they have yet to read the Highlanders series but I felt it was a brilliant move from Moning. One, because her fans who have read her previous series instantly know and connect to the characters. And two, the fans that haven't read her previous series will most likely go out and buy it now (cha-ching! Nice move Karen.)    The character development was great too. There is a lot of interaction with Mac and Jericho. Moning almost took me to the breaking point with them. I thought in Shadowfever they were going to be past dancing around each other but apparently they weren't. They have so much pride, stubbornness and fears of vulnerabilities it frustrated me to no end. I was also disappointed of the lack of feelings expressed by Barrons throughout the book. However after re-reading sections of the book I MUST retract that statement. Readers need to read between the lines and not focus so much on words but Jericho's actions. The Fever series isn't like your typical romance novel. Jericho Z. Barrons is a very complex hero who breaks the typical mould. Once you start excepting that fact, you will discover just how endearing Jericho really is.    Although there is a sense of closure by the end of the novel, there is also feelings of unrest. Not everything gets tide up at the end. *** MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*** Barrons is still somewhat of a closed book at the end. We don't really get to know anymore about his previous life except for his child. We also still don't have a clear idea what Jericho and his friends are, although I am pretty sure if you read \\"To Tame the Highland Warrior\\" you might have an idea. That's my theory.    *** MAJOR SPOILERS STILL AHEAD***  We are also left wondering what Moning has in store for Dani and Christian. How will Mac deal with Dani? What job does Ryodan have for Dani? What will become of Christian? What favors will Mac grant the Gray Lady in the future? Will Jericho's entourage ever except Mac? What will become of the Queen/concubine? Will the walls ever be restored? Is the Sinsar Dugh really safe in Mac's mind?  ***END SPOILER***    To conclude, yes, it was a satisfying ending that quenched the unrelenting thirst Karen Marie Moning created. However, I'm not quite sure if I will ever be able to tame the fanatic she brilliantly created within me. I am already pumped and psyched for whatevershe has in store for us in the future.    Note to the Author: Great job!! Take a break if you must but then get off your ass soon and write us some more spellbinding literature. You're responsible for making us all addicts therefor it's your responsibility to supply us with your drugs. :-)
1594202842|1.0|I was raised in Asia and was demanded to perform well in every aspect of my life.  I became very critical of myself and believed I can never be good enough in my parents and teachers' eyes.  My parents were very stern and strict and they could always find something to get upset about with things I do or say.  There is no time to relax; there is no time to play, just work work and more work.  I can not even show any happiness.  I had to be serious all the time.  I was very depressed and suicidal for the most part of my youth while living with my parent.  In fact, I felt I almost went crazy.  After I left their shelter, I started having a lot of emotional problems and had to seek help.  No! Conventional counselors or psychologists could NOT do anything to help me at all.  I had to turn to Heavenly Father to take away my pain, fear, self-criticism, anger, etc.  I had to learn to forgive all of the cruelty, ignorance, and abuse my parents and society inflicted upon me and all the innocent youth.  Amy Chua might be bragging about her children's achievement as my parents are very proud of mine.  But she will come to understand that her parenting would do more harm to her daughters than the good.  All the abuse are stored in the posterity's DNA and it takes great efforts to break that generational patterns.  If the daughters did not clear and release the trauma, they will repeat the same abuse to their posterity either consciously or subconsciously.  I am saddened by Amy Chua's way of teaching and she hasn't seen the outcome of her extreme parenting yet from the eternal perspective.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What's with all the hate?  I thought this box set was JUST recently announced.  Now I see everyone and their grandmother is reviewing this Blu-ray set and spewing nothing but negativity out on it.  Everyone's main gripe seems to be that the classic movies aren't in this set.  Deciding I wanted to see it for myself, I cancelled my pre-order and proceeded immediately to the movie section at Wal-Mart... just to be disappointed when I saw they not only didn't have it, but it's NOT BEING RELEASED UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR.  Being it's still January, I began wrapping my mind around why trolls on Amazon.com are writing negative, nasty reviews about a boxset that hasn't even been released.<br /><br />Then I realized something:  There were already a couple seperate releases of Star Wars already out on the DVD market.  When it was first released, you all cried about the original movies not being released with it.  Then, when those slim boxsets were released the original trilogy came with the classic movies, and yet you all complained that the master wasn't good enough. (and honestly, who could blame you? the aspect ratio is chunky and awful)  Now, this Blu-ray boxset is being announced, with very vague details of its contents.<br /><br />Therefore, why are you all complaining about something that hasn't been released yet?  Are you all so self-centered and egotistical that you think your negative pre-release reviews are actually gonna stop people from buying it, even if the original movies aren't included?  To those of you complaining about the original trilogy:  First of all, shut up.  The Blu-rays aren't out yet, you have no right whining about it until AFTER they've been released.  Second of all, if you already have the original trilogy on DVD or video, then DON'T FREAKING COMPLAIN.  If you wanna watch the original dated versions, then go the frick ahead and do so.  No one's stopping you!<br /><br />Unlike you cry-baby whiners, there's a lot of us out there who don't care whether a film was slightly altered to make it more modern.  Some of us just appreciate movies for what they are:  Timeless distractions from the ordinary.  These movies, as timeless as they are, are no different.  Well, except for the prequels.  They kinda stunk.  But nonetheless, these are the Star Wars movies on Blu-ray, what you see is what you get.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  If you don't like the idea, don't buy it, but don't troll on here and expect to change people's minds.  You can stop annoying people now.  Thank you!<br /><br />P.S.  I WILL be buying this!ghtly altered to make it more modern.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|Utterly brilliant documentary and narrative. The movie portrays the quasi-innocent caper of the century. The individual narrations are extremely well edited and well portrayed. The narratives border on being great acting performances. The action is built around an obsession to achieve an impossible goal - to wire-walk between the New York Twin Towers. The film uses the docu-history technique to build suspense leading up to the finale. When the caper is finally pulled off, the film is particularly moving in light of the Twin Tower destruction.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|the music, once again by the duo of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, was fantastic!!! Sad, dark, thrilling are only a few words to describe this soundtrack. The Joker's theme itself was great, really adding to the character. And unlike most soundtracks, as far as I can tell it has every bit of music heard in the film.
1439156816|3.0|This book was recommended to me. I found it an easy read, though lacking, but cannot be specific in what was lacking. The author did say this was not a writing manual and more his thoughts oh how to be a better writer. The first half of the book is about how he became a writer, the second half is where you glean tidbits on how to write.     Andre J Schwab
B000002KDO|5.0|My favorite of Black Sabbath's albums, categorized as the first stoner rock album of the day. And although you don't have to be stoned to enjoy this album, being so certainly deepens the experience.
030746363X|3.0|I purchased this book as a gift for a friend of mine.  He has emailed me saying that it's a very interesting book and is using some of the information.  If you plan to send this book to someone have it sent direct from Amazon and save the additional postage, it's heavy.
B00009NH5W|4.0|This is an interesting CD in TTD's discography. Why? Cause it is the last CD where he uses his birth name and not his changed name of Sananda Maitreya. I feel this is the last recording he put out where the music feels and sounds like his 80's and 90's output. And that's a good thing. It sounds like Terence Trent D'arby. We know him. We don't know Sananda Maitreya. But there are some great songs in this set. There are some lesser lights too, what pop CD doesn't have them? Some of the gems are: The Inner Scream, What Shall I do?, Shalom, Girl, Ev'rything, Sweetness, Some Birds Blue...  When I hear this CD it reminds me of why I love this guys music: his voice, his unique soulfulness, his musicianship and his eclectic nature.
1427210497|2.0|I give the author credit for his knowledge of the English language and his ability to endure extremely annoying characters on his path to discredit the idea of freedom. After all, that's what this book is: an attack on freedom. The word is used often throughout the book and in each case, the result is negative. Freedom causes a housewife's depression. Freedom causes a punk kid with conservative leanings to become a lustful familial destroyer. And freedom causes mass population to act like Visigoths on the doorstep of the \\"Roman\\" Rousseauian nature.<br /><br />At the very least, this book provides the prototype to a character of unmitigated evil: Walter, the tea-totaling family man whose good-natured environmentalism has turned him into an eerily Nazi-esque population control activist. That, accompanied with his hate of the red necks and unwashed masses of middle America no doubt summarizes the author's own view. If that character doesn't sound all that bad to you, you will love this book. Being a lover of freedom, I found it hard to stomach.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|Let's face it. JP has a formula. Awesome guitar mechanics, driving and mathematical drums and timing, and ROB HALFORD. It seems to me....... {ever so humble and possibly wrong}..... that this album gave full control to Rob Halford. Hopefully I am wrong. Rob is at his best working within the formula. In this album the guitars were awesome but seemed to be restricted by the almost boring repetetiveness and monk like droning of {My Hero} Rob Halford. Worth a listen, but the synergy is missing a tick. PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAASE MAKE ANOTHER............KNOW YOU CAN KNOCK THAT BEAST OUT OF THE PARK. LOVE THE PRIEST!!!!!
0553381687|3.0|First let me say that the books are truly excellent in every way. Having said that you should decide, before you begin to read them, if you are the type of person who would read a good book even if the last chapter were torn out.<br /><br />Martin is 63 years old. He's been working on the last book for six years now. If he were to publish the next book today (Jan 2011) and continue at the same rate he could finish at 73. If you plot a curve to allow for the increased time it took for each book he would have to live to 100 to finish them.<br /><br />These could be among the greatest books of our time, certainly the greatest of this genera, but as an unfinished set they are doomed to be nothing more than a curiosity. This is a clear case of Robert Jordan syndrome in the making.<br /><br />I guess I'm glad I started reading them, they are extremely enjoyable, but I suspect I will go to my own grave wondering how the story ended.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Major fan of Priest since teenager in 1982, British Steel?  The music kept getting heavier and faster, except for turbo lover (slightly commercial} and maxed out with painkillier. Rob was missing for a while, BUT CANNOT BE DENIED. The fact that he is back is so awesome----perfect fit---Synergy that cannot be denied, just like the magic created by Led Zeppelin. They are rendered almost useless without their cohorts. Played this album over and over. Gave it some time. Was ready to Jam again, but I cannot find This bdlfkng CD. I need to replace this treasure but don't want to pay again. Maybe it'll show up
0385341679|5.0|I've just finished reading what has to be my most anticipated urban fantasy series finale ever.  I'll admit that although I've been twitching and whining for Shadowfever ever since I read the final line in Dreamfever, I was a little nervous when I finally got my hands on it. Sometimes unreasonably high expectations can doom a book before the first page is even read. After recently re-reading the fever series, I wondered if Karen Marie Moning would answer all my questions, tie up all the loose ends and would she be able to throw in anything unexpected? We Fever fans have speculated and theorized and dissected this series to bits. We've left no stone unturned right?  Wrong. Karen Marie Moning brought her \\"A\\" game and brought it big time with unexpected twists and turns throughout the entire story.<br /><br />I feel like it's impossible for me to write an in-depth review on this book without including spoilers so I won't. I'll just tell you how I felt about this amazing story without going into too much detail about events, jaw droppers and oh-em-gee moments. (And there are many, many of those moments.)<br /><br />Epic is the word that first came to my mind after I read the words \\"The End\\" and closed the book on what was an amazing journey. I don't think I've ever read a more satisfying final book in a series. I can't even count how many times I was taken by surprise, shocked, blindsided and thrilled. I was left emotionally spent and completely happy with the many unexpected paths this story took.<br /><br />Karen Marie Moning promised in her note to her readers at the end of Faefever that Mac would eventually have brighter days. I found myself wondering how it could be possible as Mac faced impossible foes, heartbreak, internal conflict as she fought her way through Fae infested Dublin. In Shadowfever we see a Mac that is broken beyond her limits, pushed to extremes only to see her rise up and fight another day. We see a Barrons that maintains his title, CJ (constant jackass) yet shows more of his heart than ever before. Since I'm a romance reader the happily ever after is a must and I was not disappointed in any way whatsoever with the conclusion of Mac and Barrons' journey.<br /><br />Mac's story has been told and although the loose ends are tied up, it's not necessarily a tidy little package. The ending implies there will be more to come from the fever world. Many of the Fever series secondary characters hold potential for some interesting stories to come. There is Dani, who is still very young and wild, Barrons' eight who are all just as cantankerous and jack-assy as Barrons', Detective Jayne and his men who are still fighting the good fight, Christian (I won't say what his deal is) and perhaps even Jo and a few of Mac's fellow Sidhe-seers.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and it will go straight to my `read-it-again' shelf alongside its four predecessors. My worries about over-inflated expectations and hype were completely unfounded as I was enthralled from the very first chapter. Karen Marie Moning ended her series on a high note and left me completely happy with the conclusion of one of my very favorite series.of his heart than ever before.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is a little different from your average \\"family\\" movie...in a good way.  There's some rude humor (but not as overt as Shrek for example) but enough to keep my youngest very happy. It's a fun adventure with a heart, creative and not completely predictable.  And the best part?  Minions, of course!

B00275EHJG|5.0|I have raised my kids on Pixar, and I love the films as much as they do.  This last installment was so bittersweet, as growing up can be.  New characters were introduced, some of the old ones sold and seen only in flashback (Miss you Bo Peep!) and this was a confident, one-last-visit with good friends movie.  Any fault I may find is that it seemed too real!  (Seriously, I cried over these computer generated playthings.)  It was right that the characters we know so well got one last playtime with Andy before he left for college.  Pixar is the best in the industry, and always a good bet.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins is a book I couldn't put down. I completely fell in love with Anna's voice from almost the first page. I have never had a character in a book feel more real to me in my whole fifteen or so years of reading. I found myself wanting to be in her head forever. And Etienne! From the description of the back cover, I was expecting him to be some cookie-cutter hot British boy, but no. He felt just as real and had just as much depth as Anna herself. Stephanie also did a very good job of establishing setting. I felt like I was exploring Paris with Anna and I felt like her friends were my friends. Stephanie Perkins must have magical author powers because this is not the type of book I usually read (see above for what that is). I probably never would have given it a second look if John Green hadn't praised it so profusely, but since he raved about it, I had to give it a try. I mean, a man loved a book called Anna and the French Kiss? That means it's gotta be good, right? Right! I honestly can't wait for Stephanie's next book. It's called Lola and the Boy Next Door and it's supposed to be a companion book to Anna. September can't come quickly enough!<br /><br />More reviews on my blog! Link in my profile.

0553381687|4.0|The first thing I will say about A Game of Thrones is that George R. R. Martin certainly has earned that title. Since The Lord of the Rings, I don't think I have ever read a fantasy novel set in a made up world that is so detailed and different from our own and yet so similar and real. The amount of creative energy and research (yes, creating believable fantasy settings does require research) that must have gone into creating the world of the Seven Kingdoms and the Dothraki is mind-blowing. I can only hope that one day I will be able to create a world that vivid and detailed.<br /><br />Another unbelievably detailed aspect of A Game of Thrones is the plot. There is just SO much going on in this book that it's hard to keep up with it all. Martin handles his many points of views masterfully. The MANY pieces of the plot and the mysteries come together slowly in a way that gives the reader a chance to guess what is going on before the characters do. This makes the book a very rewarding read.<br /><br />The excruciating detail that had to go into the plot and setting of A Game of Thrones was very daunting. I couldn't help but think, \\"Why am I even trying to write in this genre? There's no WAY I'll ever be able to come up with plots as complicated as this or settings this vivid.\\" I still feel that way quite a bit, and even more so now that I'm half way through the second book in the series, but I have decided to press on anyway. I don't think I will ever write anything like what George R. R. Martin has written, but after some thought, I realize that I don't really want to. My characters are more character-based than plot-based, though I do like creating detailed fantasy worlds.<br /><br />There was something lacking for me in A Game of Thrones that is always present in books I love. That something is a connection to a character. Within a A Game of Thrones, there seems to be hundreds of characters, and nine of those get their own POV chapters. Despite this unlimited choice, I didn't fall in love with ANY of Martin's characters. There are many reasons for this. The most obvious is that not enough time was spent on any one character. Every time I started to feel a twinge of fondness for one, the chapter would end and I would not get another glimpse of her for another hundred pages. Unfortunately, that is the risk when you try to write from so many different points of view. Another reason is that a lot of characters seemed very... cookie-cutter. Arya was the stereotypical tomboy, Sansa the girly-girl, Eddard the honor-always-comes-first nobleman*. I've seen all of these characters before so for most of the book they bored me (Note: the CHARACTERS bored me, not the plot). The only POVs I found remotely interesting were Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen. However, I never grew to care much about them just because I didn't get enough uninterrupted time with them. That being said, I do like them, and they are the main reason I picked up the second book.<br /><br />For more reviews, visit my blog!

B002HWRYJE|4.0|...but here's my 2¢.<br /><br />This is a Star Trek reboot. That will be obvious to any fan of the original series as the inconsistencies with that series keep piling up. Obviously the producers wanted to start with a clean sheet of paper and not be bound as if in a straightjacket by the '60s original. To their credit the producers do this in a very well conceived way which leaves the original intact.<br /><br />The story was top notch, easily the best Star Trek movie since \\"Wrath of Khan\\" in my opinion. Gripping story, lots of action, touches of humor, drama, etc abound. I was relieved that the bane of previous Trek films - lines and occasionally entire scenes aimed at hard core trekkies - are either not present or suitably subtle here.<br /><br />The casting was great also. I thought Zachary Quinto was especially good. Recasting such well known and much loved characters is always a big risk. Here it was pulled off brilliantly. Interesting is the reimagining of Kirk as a rebel without a cause instead of the \\"serious, positively grim\\" cadet.<br /><br />There was one thing that annoyed me and led me to deduct a full star. Kirk gets to be a Captain waaay too quickly. It is just not believable that anyone would be commanding a major warship so quickly. No second class Midshipman would be given command of a nuclear aircraft carrier no matter how brilliantly or bravely he performed. Star Trek in all its incarnations has never quite grasped the essentials of military protocols but this seems to be way over the top. I understand the producers wanted Kirk in the Captain's chair as quickly as possible - this is just a clumsy way to get there.<br /><br />Highly recommended to Star Trek fans. If your not a Trek fan this is a good place to jump on as the baggage of previous movies and series has been jettisoned.
B00192IV9U|3.0|Now obviously the point is too strong to even mention here:Michael Jackson is dead and with all the legal ranglings surrounding the final years of his musical output Sony/Epic decided to throw this album together to release an album the year after Michael's passing. The interesting aspect of this is not so much that it seems like the beginning of a Jimi Hendrix-like series of posthumous albums of questionable backround. Rather the trouble is,as some of the reviews here are delighted to point out (and I personally didn't want to believe) a good chunk of the music on this album,sadly DOES in fact feature lead vocals from MJ impersonators who in a lot of cases are not even close in sound. Since I very strong disapprove of this sort of disservice to someone of Mike's talent being exploited in his death in this way (and if I'd known I'd never have purchased this album) I am choosing to review ONLY the songs on this album I know for a fact feature the genuine Michael Jackson himself.<br /><br />  Since none of this material was complete or intended to be part of a cohesive album this all does sound like bits and pieces from the archives. \\"Hold Your Hand\\",the debut single (a duet with Akon).....well I hate to report just isn't much of a song,even though Michael Jackson is on it and co-wrote it. I understand his need to keep up with pop trends but he should have continued to set them and the sound of Akon is so typical when it's used by Chris Brown,Usher and a multitude of others. It's just boring compared to Michael's usually high standards. \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" is a bit better,a harken back to the [[ASIN:B00005QGAV Dangerous]]/[[ASIN:B0000029LG History]] style of hip-hop oriented dance/funk that does sound kind of old but does sound alive at the very least. \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\\" has much more of the type of quirky pop style MJ could easily serve up in his heyday. It has a clever tribute to the 60's Holland/Dozier/Holland type Motown rhythm and is rather charming. Lenny Kravitz's \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\" is a tough one as it features Lenny,Michael and what does sound like an impersonator but is a blistering funk/rock track of a type I never heard Michael do. I've heard him do music closer to rock and closer to funk but going for such a tough combination is an excellent idea.<br /><br />  \\"Behind The Mask\\" is a strong dance track,remixed from a song Mike wrote and recorded roughly around the time of the [[ASIN:B0012GMZBI Victory]] tour and while it's remixed to sound somewhat more contemporary as it were I can tell Mike's vocals were recorded during the mid 80's. And besides hearing Greg Phillinganes and Eric Clapton's versions of this song it was wonderful to hear it as performed by the original source. \\"Much Too Soon\\" is an excellent way to close the album with a folksy singer-songwriter flavor somewhat reminiscent of \\"Be Not Always\\" from the [[ASIN:B0012GMZBI Victory]] sixteen years earlier but with a more romantic woe orientation to the lyric. I personally believe this album would've been a  great posthumous triumph if all the tracks actually featured the artist himself,which they didn't. But what is present from Mike is actually some of his stronger recent material compared to his uneven previous album [[ASIN:B00005Q4JH Invincible]];I only deduct so many stars due to the presense of impersonators. Tacky as that was on Sony's part there's some excellent music here if you want to hear it.zier/Holland type Motown rhythm and is rather charming.

1594202842|5.0|I was really interested in the conflict that came up with this book,and before starting discussions with my friends I decided I had to read it to know what I was talking about.<br />This book is a memoir,not a guide,and shouldn't be used as a guide.I was a great read,Amy Chua changed when her child put the foot down,it is an interesting journey,dont expect to learn \\"How to raise your kids perfectly\\".Amy is tough and those kids went through insane strict rules,but she snapped into the real world when her younger daughter spilled a good dose of reality!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I'm a dude, but this book had me streaming tears through the whole read. It's incredibly vivid and alive and allows you to really understand the main character. The book really opens around you, creating a world where you become so empathetic to the main character, those with serious traumas may find it a bit difficult to read as they may feel they are reliving. I was almost glad when I finished the book (1.5 nights read) as I could dry my eyes and move on...     It made me want children I could keep safe...
0061801313|5.0|If you watch the series in TV or it you just love reading, these books are fabulous. Not the best writing, but the stories make you want to keep turning the page.
0525951652|5.0|I'll keep it short. If you like Ken Follett you have to read this book. I didn't want to put it away once I got started. It also provides you with some nice insights around WW I
0385341679|5.0|SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    This beautiful book was worth the wait, at first I was royally pissed about the fact that the release date kept getting delayed and I HATED it. I have been a loyal fan from day one. I fell in love with Mac and Barrons. I cried and laughed with them throughout the whole series. I don't regret a penny I have spent in any of her books. Moning is an incredible author. Every word is explosion of emotion. She grabs your attention from beginning to end. This book was packed with information that we have been dying to know from day one! I was so excited and happy to finally know who and what Mac is. Though Barrons is still a mystery we have more information on him. Who would have thought that V'lane was none other then Cruce! My god I did not see that coming! I loved to see the Keltars back in action. My heart wept when I found out Dani was Alina's murderer. I felt betrayed by the rebellious but lovable girl. The BG was none other then The Unseelie king! The book was perfect. It was everything and much much more than I was expecting. It was VERY depressing to think Mac had killed the love of our life Barrons! Those first two chapters were by far the most emotional pages in the book. I couldn't stop my tears. To sum it up this book was amazing and I disagree with anyone who has given it less then 5 stars. It was a real bitter-sweet ending. I can't wait for the spin offs to begin. I want more FEVER!
B000092T6M|4.0|Kevin Costner and more star in this 1991 adventure remake.  A man becomes a legendary outlaw trying to save his land  from a ruthless sheriff. I saw this at the movies and liked   it since. This special edition not only has nice picture and   sound, but 12 minutes of extended footage plus neat extras.   I recommend this good version.
0385341679|5.0|Best book in the series and I loved them all. I was so happy for her and all the self dicovery she did. I hope that she writes books aboout Ryodan and Christian now and other characters of the book, Dani to name another. I would love to just get little pieces of barrons and Mac years from now. I will truely miss all of theese characters, but my husband will be glad that once a year for 24 hours I won't be dead to the world ignoring all just so I can read the newest fever book!!!

It helps us understand what is going on in their minds & how they hear things & I believe like Temple they specilize in something else !    God bless !

0385341679|5.0|It's hard to describe how excited I was, first to finally hold Shadowfever in my hands, then to read it, and finally to finish it. Each time my roommate asked me how the book was, all I could say was, \\"...it's sooooo good!\\" All the major questions were answered, Mac got the happy ending I'd hoped for (without any cheesy out-of-character-goofiness from anyone), while Dani and Christian's stories still left enough loose ends open for future books.<br /><br />Now that I've read the book at about a million miles an hour, it's time to reread it more slowly and savor all the juicy bits!
0385341679|5.0|It has been a long and agonizing wait for the final chapter in the Fever series. The wait was well worth it! The craftiness that KMM weaved the story with, I lost count of all the twists and turns. When I thought I had it figured out she managed to pull the rug out from underneath me again! It was brilliant. It is very true what others have been saying, it will not end the way you think.<br /><br />This is really a great piece of workmanship. This wasn't one of those reads where you can figure out where the story is going and sit tight to enjoy the ride. This is a read where everything is called into question and as the story unfolds you are amazed at how Moning was able to blind side her readers into a twist that you couldn't have conceived. Brilliant ending. And even better, a hint that there may be other books set in the Fever series. I can't wait to see what else KMM can cook up for us!

1579128149|5.0|Great book on the elements, pictorial and in writing, concise, it is a great way to study the elements and their uses, as a student or to have as a reference. I bought one as a Christmas present for a friend who started back to college in the sciences, and she received the same book as a present from her kids! She has since passed along the second book to a worthy reader.  Would recommend this for ages 12 on up...who knows, maybe younger ones would appreciate it also.

Since I had the regular DVD, I ran the regular DVD in my PS3 and swapped in the Blu-ray to compare.  No difference whatsoever.  People giving this Blu-ray a good review love Ghostbusters, not the Blu-ray version particularly.  I challenge you to get a regular DVD version of this and compare with the Blu-ray version.  No difference whatsoever.  You could even make this a double blind study if you covered the labels;)
B002ZG999U|3.0|Expendables embodies the good, slapstick, abrasive, and wild style that makes action films enjoyable no matter how derivative or predictable. I absolutely enjoyed this film but obviously it was too short. It felt like a really long trailer, with a movie dealing a lot with trust and decisions. Rourke was one person who lit up the screen but you gotta as why as a former teammate Tool. Matter of fact, here is all the expendables roles, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallione), former SAS soldier and blades specialist Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), sniper Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), weapons specialist Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and demolitions expert Toll Road (Randy Couture). A great, vibrant cast but not utilized all efficiently.    Couture is a UFC fighter and he used no UFC moves? Anyway, I sorta expected him to have a minor erole and to be made funny as he was in the beginning of the film. I praise Crews for just when he used the big weapon on Munroe's soldiers. The trio Couture, Crews ,Li, and Statham were convincing and efficient in the end of the film. I actually found Willis' and Schwarzenegger's role in the film amusing and worthwhile because they can be really funny sometimes. And Statham and Stallone were the stars of the film and were really fresh on the screen, and it seemed like they would actually do all their antics in real life, no they would.    Let's understand that this is way too short as even 16 minutes could have made this a full-fledged four star movie, but I get that this is not exactly on the X-men's line of action, but turned out to be just a petty decent, and above average action film. Give it a shot, and you are going to like it or at least agree with me. You will enjoy the enriching humor and hardcore thinking of the characters. Nobody officially stole the show in my opinion because every character was defiant, careless, and aggressive. Great action flick. And it was original for not having a real love story,more like I must prove myself and protect other people story.    7.4/10, but on here 3/5.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|this movie is one of the best suspense thrillers ive senn. Great movie especially for being 1.5 hours of a dude trapped in a coffin. GREAT STUFF MUST BUY!!!
B00004Z511|5.0|Yorke said the album was partly about \\"the generation that will inherit the earth when we've wiped everything [sic] out. Thank you as well Johnny Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Colin Greenwood and Phil Selway and the whole personal as well. This album is above and beyond the world excellent and should be in the thesaurus next to excellent's synonyms Radiohead's Kid A and should be number one.    Continuing on, everything about this album is impressive is striking and superior.  First of all, this album is influenced by greats such as the Talking heads, Blackalicious, and DJ Krush, only the first two who I have heard of. Here are my favorite tracks. Idioteque is a sample of sample the work of Paul Lansky and Arthur Kreiger, who specialized computer music. And then you have another one of my favorites Kid A, which is extremely electronic and features distorted vocals from Yorke. Thirdly, is the National Anthem soundtrack, which has a bassline and horn section. And then we have the Motion Picture Soundtrack, an astonishing and lengthy ending track which is very slow and grand for dramatic effect.    I like the electronic style but not 100 percent because it was really hard to hear the lyrics on this album, yeah Radiohead you got me. It is a mix of ambient, jazz, and electronic influences. Lastly the album is perfect lyrically as it focuses on the generation that will inherit the earth. It also focuses on anti-consumerism, personal dreams, and probably about their personal lives themselves.    This is my favorite Alternative album ever and Electronica as well. It deserves to be. Brilliant and impressive throughout could have also been its name. God bless once again. It deserved to win the 2001 Grammy Album of the Year and is true perfection. It is my third Favorite and Best Album of all time and could be the greatest album of all time.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I purchased this set for my husband and was very impressed with not only the price, but also the case the set comes in and the quality of the DVD's.  I highly recommend this set for those people who love Band of Brothers and other war shows.
1594202842|1.0|I just cannot understand why people still waste time and money on such trash. There are enough reviews and discussions about this book. Read them and use your mind, you will find this is not a book about parenting. It is merely a piece of junk made by a self-centered ambitious woman with a law school professor title. What a mirror to reflect the so-called elite education in the U.S.! Such an elite like Miss Chua is a joke, and she's a law school professor? Shame on Yale!

B002ZG993Q|2.0|Wow. I've often thought that stores, manufacturers and, in this case, moviemakers planted positive reviews on sites like these, and now I'm certain.  By any objective measure, The American is a bad movie, so all these glowing reviews are a mystery.    Yes, with its setting in Sweden and the Italian countryside, The American has plenty of stunning images.  Yes, there are plenty of good cloak-and-dagger scenes.  And, yes, there's a voluptuous hooker who takes off her clothes a lot.    But this movie is missing one key factor: a plot.     We never find out who Clooney's character is, what his \\"job\\" is or was, who he works for, why he mopes around the entire movie, or why mysterious people are trying to kill him.     I kept waiting for some explanation, some story line that would make the whole thing make sense.  But it never came, which is too bad, really.  This could have been a very good movie if the director had decided to let the audience in on the story.    Oh well, 85 percent of movies are bad anyway, so The American is pretty much the norm.
1607963027|3.0|I read this in ninth grade--both in English and (though I studied Spanish) in French--and I found it reasonably enjoyable, reasonably funny, and charged with a small number of reasonably significant life lessons. Other than that--though I've read it as an adult and, yes, even re-re-reread it--I honestly can't see the fuss.

0553805371|4.0|At the time of my writing this review, there are already 380 reviews on this book. A significant proportion was dissatisfied with the presentation by Hawking and Mlodinow. I can see the validity of their grips. There are many topics broached which could be explained in more depth, especially for those who are novices to the subject matter, and some believe that the explanations proposed here are not the only ones. In my case, I have read numerous books on cosmology, and therefore already had exposure to much of what is in this book. The purpose of the authors was not to get into an in depth treatment of the origin and nature of the universe in which we live. The book is obviously too short for that. If you want a really in depth discussion of these things, I would recommend reading Brian Greene's books on the subject. Nevertheless I found this book interesting to read.     The authors attempt to answer a number of intriguing questions such as:  * When and how did the universe begin?  * Why are we here?  * What is the nature of reality?  * Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned?  * Is the apparent \\"grand design\\" of the universe evidence of a creator?    The first three chapters introduce a number of scientists who contributed to our understanding of the world in which we live such as Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras, Democritus, Aristarchus, René Descartes, and Newton. In chapter four we get into alternative histories and Feynman's theories. Chapter five shows the efforts to develop a theory of everything discussing, among other things, the four forces, Feynman diagrams, quantum field theories, grand unified theories, quantum theory of gravity, supergravity, supersymmetry and, of course, M-theory. In chapter six, we learn about the early universe, inflation, bottom-up and top-down approaches to cosmology, and the concept of time in the early universe. Chapter seven is entitled \\"The Apparent Miracle\\" referring to the \\"miracle\\" that we exist at all given everything that must have fitted into place in order to accomplish this. Here we learn about the weak and strong anthropic principles and the cosmological constant.    As far as the questions proposed - did they answer them? Well, they did, but I really think you're going to have to read more books on the subject to satisfy your inquisitiveness.     Overall, I found the book of interest, and as I previously stated, my prior reading on the subject helped me to better understand what was discussed, whereas, someone new to the subject might require more explanation of some of the material presented.

081297381X|5.0|Nassim Taleb looks at what we know, how we know it, and whether or not we really know it. What's a Black Swan? It's an occurrence that's massively significant, it's unpredictable, and after it occurs, in an effort to make it appear more predictable and less random, we imagine that we know how and why it occurred - foolishly and erringly so in many cases. I have tended my own flock of Black Swans in the past and I'll bet that others have also.
0312600844|1.0|I kept reading this book because I thought (1) I loved the \\"Corrections\\" and this HAS to be as good; and (2) Oprah and the hoards of reviewers could not be wrong about how terrific this book is.  I will never get those lost hours back spent reading this book!! \\"Freedom\\" is unbelievably tedious.  I would never want to spend any time with any of the main characters unless I was heavily medicated.  I wish that I could give this book \\"no stars,\\" as this is what it deserves.  The one star is justified on my part because I was smart enough to check the book out from my local public library.  If you must read it, try skimming the entire book in about an hour.  In that way, you will not beat yourself up for having been duped into reading this boring tome.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|An amazing book written by an amazing woman. It's another example of a book that could not be written by anyone else. Jill Bolte Taylor is a neuroanatomist who spent her career in the study of strokes only to fall victim of one herself. Reading of a massive stroke as experienced by a brain scientist was not only fascinating and insightful, it was more than a little scary.

Excellent book for Justice League fans of all ages  (though I wouldnt leave it alone with a toddler-- too fragile).  Informative and fun!

Highly recommended.
0307272702|5.0|This book was a great condensation and summarization of Taube's longer book \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories.\\" It is much more accessible and because it only took me around 5 hours to read from cover to cover, the central premise of the book comes across more clearly.    If you haven't watched Taubes talks on youtube, then read this book. If you have watched them and he hasn't changed completely how you think about fat accumulation, then read this book. If you have watched them, read GCBC and Taubes has effectively changed how you think about getting fat, still, read this book. It will give you even more effective ways to try to get other people to understand this message.     If you've read this book and still think calories are what you should be looking at when you are talking about fat gain/loss, then there is probably no help for you. This is the best book I've read that solidly, definitively and unequivocally refutes the calories-in/calories-out hypothesis, and reestablishes obesity as a problem of malnutrition.     This book is for everyone who responds to someone talking about gaining weight with \\"Oh, they just need to exercise more, or eat less.\\" You think you understand how fat loss/gain works, but you certainly don't. Please, give up five hours of your time and read this book.

I am now looking forward to reading some of Mr. Follett's other pieces.
B000F3T7X8|5.0|I, like a lot of people probably fell on Japan by accident. They were not that big in the UK when their album Quiet Life was released prior to GTP. I found the single \\"Quiet Life\\" sitting in a bargain bin in red vinyl for 10p which at the time was a perfect price for a student of limited means. After listening to that song I was totally hooked. I knew nothing of them before and indeed unlike other reviewers, I never got to grips with anything before this single/album. However, what came after was like a Roman Candle compared to a sparkler! The album Quiet Life garnered enough attention for listeners to wonder what was coming next, I know I did. When GTP came out I think I remember Sylvian had already been crowned with the \\"most beautiful man alive\\" tag once, which no doubt helped bring attention to the band but which I think Sylvian has suffered from personally himself ever since. I remember itching to buy this album the day it came out after being hooked hearing the previous album Quiet Life though I believe it never sold that well before this album. As with most other reviewers I was not disappointed. Where Quiet Life had channelled Roxy Music in its hey day this album actually took strides to be something new. The long opening eponymous track began the climb into new territory, slow but on an even pace. This album I think cemented Japan's ability to make its own music in the world of music criticism and while it garnered quite a few hard critiques most people acknowledged by then that a new music entity had emerged. This was helped no end by a sumptuous review of a live Japan concert by Paul Morley a revered UK music critic of the time. This album put in the context of the time of its release was a new path for electronic and New Romantic music. Though largely overlooked by the mainstream fan for the more adventurous musical passenger this album was warmly received. It brilliantly brought back a scintillating brand of introspection that Roxy Music had lost whileadding a new level of incandescent electronic vibes matched with a sense of heartbreak unknown to electro New Wave fans. From the languishing, almost suicidal sweeping lush forms of Nightporter to the explosive joy of Methods of Dance, this album was pushing the limits of what music listeners knew of the electro 80s. It's not a perfect album but then no Japan album is; that they strove to push their own limits of musicianship as much as the envelope of what we knew as the New Romantics back then is a testament to their genius. I don't think they actually saw themselves as part of any movement back then but we all loved  to pigeon hole. I agree with another reviewer that Burning Bridges was a terrible blight on the album when Some Kind of Fool was so redolent of the soundscape that they had fashioned with this album. Maybe Sylvian thought it would undermine the outstanding luscious tones of Nightporter as they are quite similar in expression. Nor am I sure about the accusation that there would be no Duran Duran without Japan but I would be the first to put their hand up and join the throng who agreed that whatever glory Duran had in record sales they would have pawned their last synthesizer and no doubt their wives to have written any Japan track. If you are a fan of multi-layered soundscapes, of bearing your soul to a song or just want to be taken to a different sonic world then this is an album for you. If you just want to try a few songs before you get there try Nightporter, Methods of Dance or the sublime Swing. If you were not around when Japan was making this music I really feel for you. This was an album for all lost souls at a time when music the UK music world had a pedantic message to express and rather than shout to anyone in the streets who was passing, Japan gave us the emotional electro conduit to scream silently but beautifully at the whole insane world outside.

B003UESJHO|4.0|A trio of remarkable performances propels this frenetic, punch-drunk take on a dysfunctional family saga, and the compelling 2010 drama marks a return to form for iconoclastic director David O. Russell (his last film was the failed existential comedy, 2004's [[ASIN:B0006TPE4C I Heart Huckabees]]). Written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson, the film tells the fact-based story of boxing half-brothers \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, eking out a blue-collar existence in Lowell, Massachusetts. Dicky once went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard back in 1978, but it's the mid-1980's now, and he's vainly trying to recapture that moment of notoriety. Micky, on the other hand, remains firmly in Dicky's shadow, as he tries to follow in his footsteps and become a professional fighter. Most of the plot focuses on the demons that haunt and control them. Dicky's are internal as he has deteriorated into a scarifying crack addict and criminal, while Micky's struggles come from the stranglehold his family has on his life and career. Dicky is Micky's trainer, and their hell-bent, bottle-blonde mother Alice is his manager, neither of whom are willing to admit that they aren't savvy enough to get Micky a decent shot at the welterweight title.<br /><br />Micky's one personal salvation comes from his no-nonsense girlfriend Charlene, a tough-talking bartender who goes toe to toe with Alice and her seven grown, detestable daughters. Naturally, this sets the stage for a battle over Micky's soul. The irony of the film is that Micky has to be a dramatically inert figure since he is really a victim of his family's volatility. Consequently, Mark Wahlberg leverages his likeable average-guy demeanor to play him in an economic manner that manages to evoke sympathy for his stoic, often passive character. This gives room for Christian Bale ([[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]]) to steal his scenes handily with blazing intensity as Dicky. He dropped thirty pounds to shape his wiry, bug-eyed performance, and it sears in the memory. The gifted Melissa Leo ([[ASIN:B001KEHAG2 Frozen River]], [[ASIN:B004EQAVA0 Conviction]]) is equally fearless as the manipulative Alice, a vainglorious Lady Macbeth figure who is willing to steer her son toward failure if it means he won't abandon her. As Charlene, Amy Adams ([[ASIN:B0011U52EC Enchanted]]) surprises the most with a flurry of F-bombs that serve to protect her clear-eyed commitment to Micky, even though her character has been developed mostly on one angry note. All three deserve recognition during the awards season.<br /><br />If the movie has one persistent flaw, it's that most of the rest of the characters are reduced to caricatures, especially Alice's big-haired daughters who act like a dispiriting Greek chorus to the proceedings (and strangely no bratty children surrounding them). The comic moments are welcome, but sometimes the approach feels like it cheapens the story. Russell's idiosyncratic filmmaking style is evident throughout with the camera constantly shifting to match the nervous energy of the narrative. In order to stick to the facts, he and the screenwriters shift the story in the home stretch to Micky's journey toward the title and more or less, abandon the head-butting family dynamics driving most of the story. Although the film ties up the fate of the characters neatly, it begins to feel more like [[ASIN:B0006GAO5Y Rocky]] than [[ASIN:B004AOECUG Raging Bull]] toward the end, and a certain hollowness permeates the film's resolution, even though cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema does an excellent job staging the fights leading to the inevitable ending. However, these are forgivable lapses in judgment given the stellar work of Leo, Adams and especially Bale.performance, and it sears in the memory.

B004H1YH66|5.0|I have owned the \\"Original Score\\" release for 15 years, and it remained at the top of my favorite scores. This new recording shows an epic breadth the original score recording does not provide. While the old score it loud, rocking, and fun, this new recording shows more depth, better acoustics and shows off its true character.     Often in life, change is hard to deal with, and this is a change from we what we have listened to for years. That said, this is a far better presentation, performance, and recording than Mr. Poledouris was able to record at the time.    This will now replace the \\"Original Score\\" recording in my collection. Bravo!

0385341679|4.0|After reading books 1-4, I was dubious that KMM could tie up all of the loose ends in Fever world - there were just too many of them. After 4 full books, we had no idea who killed Alina, who or what Barrons was or the rest of his men, no idea who was really \\"good\\" or \\"bad,\\" what the point of the Book was or why it is alive, where or what is the Unseelie King, and even who or what Mac is - is she even human? And will Barrons and Mac ever get together peacefully and how is that going to work? In short, every book led to more questions and NO answers. Ending book 4 with such a cliffhanger was a downright criminal thing to do to the readers. I would rather KMM have revealed who had died as the beast then, and not at the beginning of Shadowfever. So, trying to answer all of that in one book would take a monumental writing effort and while I have some critiques here, all in all, I think KMM delivered on this one.    On the \\"good job\\" side of the equation, the plot was very hard to predict and had lots of great twists and turns - things that appeared to be one way, ended up going another direction. Mac does become a stronger character, Barrons becomes a softer one, V'lane's role is interesting, and of course, we all love a HEE. We find out who killed Alina, who the DEG is, who the real factions in the fight are, as well as many other motives for things in the previous books that, at the time, seemed to make no sense. In short - a lot of weirdness was explained.    On the \\"not so good\\" idea of the equation, several very important points of weirdness are NOT explained. What the heck happened to Barrons & his men to make them immortal? What are they? We got the backstory, but not a full explanation. Maybe that is being saved for another series. I did not buy Ryodan & guys justification for wanting to kill Mac for her relationship with Barrons - again, a little too wimpy. Rowena's role was too similar to Fiona's in the earlier books. Same motives - jealousy and misplaced ragetoward Mac for no real reason. Again, kinda weak.      Mac does get too rambley in her head. Using Mac's ramblings to try to confuse the plot is not a great trick. \\"Am I the concubine? The Unseelie King? Is Isla my mother?\\" Plot twists should rely more on actions than the musings of the main character. It makes her appear indecisive, weak and confused. I wanted her to be a much, much stronger character in this book- in her words \\"epic.\\" I think KMM was trying to pull this off by expanding the seer \\"lake\\" in her head with her powers and making Mac the sole focus of the Book and its eventual capture. I still found the whole Mac/Rowena/Book scene in the bookstore unsatisfying. I wanted more from Mac, not just psychological games, but real mastery of her abilities. Truthfully, I think I wanted Mac to be a more powerful person than she turned out to be. That she ends up not making peace and accepting her power - learning to deal with it, but instead \\"freezing\\" it out, was really disappointing.     Over all, however, it was a herculean task to wrap up most of the plot points and that was done. Also, the books were well written over all and immensely creative. I enjoyed reading all 5 of them. And that is about as much as you can ask for from an author.

B002WYH5N2|5.0|This film is hands down one of the few most visually and audibly beautiful films I have ever seen.  I watch it over and over and it is almost as if the director uses the natural beauty, power and passion of the landscapes to evoke the emotion of the scenes.  For me, the environment becomes an active feature in the film and I find myself aware of it, not in a distracting but a fulfilling way, throughout.  The proposal in the rain is full of the vital, intense, and overcast nature of each character's emotional state. Very passionate! The scene where Elizabeth meets Darcy at dawn after she realizes she is in love with him is exquisite; the dawn, a perfect time to place her revelation, he walking through the mist with coattails flapping and dressed down to meet her as an equal, the sun rising between their faces as they bring their heads together--just incredibly beautiful.  This film brings together all the artistic collaborators equally, expanding the power, effectiveness and aesthetic beauty of each scene. A work of art.     If only the world's political systems could collaborate this way.

0316098337|4.0|I didn't get around to reading Room until several months after it was published, and arguably I heard too much before I started it.  But more than plot points or spoilers, I heard too much hype.  Friend after friend spoke so glowingly of the novel: \\"I read it in one sitting.\\"  \\"I can't sleep for thinking about it.\\"  \\"This book was transformative.\\"  I have to tell you, that was not my reaction at all.<br /><br />It was a good book--unusual--but I didn't love it.  One thing I knew going in is that the story is told from the point of view of five-year-old Jack.  In very broad strokes, I'll describe the plot.  Jack's mother was abducted as college student by a man she calls \\"Old Nick.\\"  She has been held in an 11 X 11-foot finished shed in his back yard for the past seven years.  At five, Jack has never set foot outside.  He has never looked out a window.  The eponymous room and its contents is his entire world.  As noted above, Jack is narrating the story in his own semi-precocious voice.  Certainly this is a creative approach to story-telling and is why so many people have loved the novel, but it was my least favorite aspect of the story.<br /><br />We all know that as horrific a tale as Donoghue is telling, aspects of it might as well be ripped from the headlines.  But I'd much rather experience the complex fear and despair of the captive mother's thoughts than hear from the five-year-old, \\"Ma's having one of her bad days.\\"  While there are some amazing aspects of seeing the tale unfold through Jack's innocent eyes, there's a price to be paid in sophistication.  I'd have been a lot more satisfied had the narration alternated between the two.<br /><br />And then there's this:  I am not a child-oriented person.  I'm not a parent, and if I'm going to be blunt, I'm not a fan of small children.  As they tend to do in life, this child narrator annoyed me.  (Sorry!  I know I'm an awful person--but honest.)  I don't recall feeling the same way about Jonathan Safran Foer's child protagonist of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.  What a difference a few years makes.<br /><br />So, clearly I'm unable to embrace this novel with the affection that others have.  That said, it handily earns four stars for the caliber of the writing, the awesome creativity of the approach, the depth of the characters, and the riveting plot.  Undoubtedly, were I not a curmudgeon, I'd quickly cough up that fifth star and give this book the full accolades it deserves.remely Loud and Incredibly Close.  What a difference a few years makes.

B004EI3ON4|4.0|The original score by the masters of chunky, tasty, funky French techno Daft Punk is better than the predictable and hard-to-sit-through movie itself. The only reason I enjoyed myself while sitting through a very Disney film is because I spent about two hours sitting and listening to a brand new Daft Punk album on loud, great speakers at the movie theater. (So it ended up being worth the ticket price.)    The retro but futuristic sound fits the 1980's vision of the cyber world that the movie's visuals come from. Perfectly.
B002ZG981E|5.0|For just under $20, you get the movie in Blue-ray, DVD, and in a digital copy to play on a computer. Plus, it includes a disc with many bonus features including the movie soundtrack, behind-the-scenes look at making the movie, a closer look at the study of dreams, and much more. This is a very good deal and a great movie all in a bundle!    The movie itself was worth more than watching it once. It takes the some concepts of dreams, such as dreaming within a dream and killing yourself to wake up, and brings it out to a full length movie. But it's not a documentary, no worries! The plot involves a man and a team taking on a job where they must somehow convince a young man to not take on his father's legacy in controlling a company that controls half the worlds' energy supply. Of course, what better way to change someone's mind than to manipulate the people, places, and memories in a person's dream.

0553805371|2.0|Stephen Hawking's assertion that God was not needed in the creation of the universe is absolutely absurd.  My God's brilliance made the universe observable and accessible even for a wheel chair bound physicist.  The so called big bang is proof of our universe being spoken into existence, it's precise timing, so critical to our existence and to the universe as we know it.  I cannot buy into the multi-verse theory, an obvious attempt to explain away our miraculous existence.    Just as Darwin was wrong about life being and undirected process, Hawkings is wrong about our universe being likewise.  No way is this random, even an infinite amount of universes couldn't have possibly resulted in our universe.  The DNA molecule, and the assembly of the right amount of proteins in the proper sequence in the same universe?  I say to those who have bought into science's efforts to disprove God's existence, read the Bible.   The book is entertaining, but I found it to be the same rhetoric that physicists have been spouting for years.  When a scientists runs into a wall, most are clever enough to mathematically dig their way out.  It's all still theoretical and nothing more, but nevertheless intriguing.

So how on earth can you say that science, which was the last to arrive in the creation time-line and far younger than man himself and also a product of man's intelligence is a prediction of what came into existence about 13.7 trillion years ago when man who created it had not even dreamt of coming into existence and then you award all the glory of creation to science?<br /><br />Secondly, according to you, \\"...our presence selects out from this vast array only those universes that are compatible with our existence\\" - what I think you are implying is that \\"our presence\\" created us after waiting patiently for approximately 13.7 trillion years that it took for the big-bang to cool down during which it (our presence) was busy conducting an infinite number of experiments in an infinite number of universes, galaxies, planets, stars, meteorites, comets, asteroids, dusts... through an infinite time frame before finally arriving at the best possible option - the earth and now decided to create us in here - all glory be to \\"our all-mighty presence!\\"<br /><br />All I could see in this argument is a very dull attempt to factor out the idea of God-centered creation and replace it with a quantum-physics centered creation and you have not told us why you decided to take-to that path (well, probably because you dwell on evidences as a scientist and you have chosen not to acknowledge the existence of God amidst all the obvious everyday miracles!)<br /><br />Your theory that our universe created itself from a microscopic nothingness and maintains itself by the laws of quantum physics is not quite different but as awkward and baseless as the fact that the table (and every other thing) disappears or vaporizes whenever you leave the room, only to re-appear or re-condense just at the moment you are about to reenter the same room! It sounds more like science fiction.<br /><br />You presented all the evidences that are beyond human manipulations - that we didn't arrive here by accidents but through a 100% precision from all calculations and yet you wouldn't acknowledge the fact that a Supreme Intelligence was responsible for the precision and has been very busy and benevolent enough in putting everything in place for us!<br /><br />I suggest you change the title of your book to professor Hawking's proposed grand design because I was a bit surprised, after reading the whole book to find out that you are yet to discover what you claimed to have found!<br /><br />I am a student of science and I so much believe in the big-bang theory but I don't think the big-bang triggered itself or created us. Science is an integral part of existence and there is no way we can divorce science from faith if we truly want to understand anything. There is a real God that created us all and He has once visited me in reality.<br /><br />Jesus is the backup plan for saving humanity from hell. God could have used any process; big, small or medium-bang to create our universe but to believe that the universe created itself from the laws of gravity or quantum physics defiles all common and uncommon sense because even the laws of physics states that a body would continue in its state of rest or if moving, will continue to move with a uniform velocity on a straight line unless it is acted upon by an external force.

I can easily burn out my (early Foxconn socket) motherboard before overheating the CPU.  It's not too loud either; the fan on my graphics card is much louder even at 2000 rpm.  Get this cooler for overclocking, or to have a nearly silent cooler to replace your stock one!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting for ShadowFever to hit my kindle and I was not disappointed in the least.  This book was the PERFECT conclusion to this series.  The characters are just...Wow.  I don't know how else to describe it.  This series is one of my favorites and I really hope to see more of this world Karen has created.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I got this for my young adult son, who loves it. I watched it while he was showing it to his older brother, who didn't like it quite so much.     I do remember the whole early save-the-princess games our kids would play (think \\"Mario Brothers\\" and \\"Zelda\\"), which is probably somewhat of a must for \\"getting\\" this plot, but I'm sure my age and general lack of enthusiasm for and actual participation in such things at the time probably reduces my understanding of subtle things in the movie. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again (like my son does, over and over), but I do think the plot stands fairly well on its own (boy meets girl, boy wants girl, boy has to jump through hoops to get girl), even without gamer knowledge, if you can just go along with the idea that this is a pretty good \\"real\\" depiction of a virtual reality moment. The whole thing is actually quite creative.    Three stars for me, five from my son - a four star average.

B00337KM2S|4.0|Up in the Air starring George Clooney is a very original and clever comedy/drama. Clooney is one of those actors who never really challenges himself but his role in this film is quite good and surprising. His love interest played by the very talented Vera Farmiga really adds depth and there's also a dramatic twist at the end that I never saw coming. Anna Kendrick is also good in this film, her character is very naive in the start but by the end, she becomes a more compassionate and well-rounded person. Up in the Air isn't a perfect film and it's slow in certain parts but overall, I enjoyed it very much!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is an incredible film. I highly Reccomend it    Synopsis  Donald \\"Donnie\\" Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself suffering from psychotic delusions, and becomes an object of frustration for his family. With the guidance of Frank, a man in a bunny rabbit suit, Donnie wreaks havoc upon the town of Middlesex, Virginia. Other notable actors involved include Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore.

B002ZG981E|1.0|Just when you thought it was safe to take a nap ......  Here comes a science fiction flick with unimpressive special effects and no colorful characters.  How about suspense?  Are we actually expected to care about people who may or may not be dreams? Deplore the demolition of buildings which may or may not be dreams?  What else is this movie lacking?  It offers no comic relief, no good background music and ordinary costumes.  The actors look too much alike and none of them are easy on the eyes.  Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer attractive and commands little stage presence.  Two hours wasted is my opinion of this film.

B002Q63JEU|5.0|I had been waivering on whether or not I wanted this download... I had been listening a bit on youtube....  I am picky about what I actually buy, just super cheap.  Well, I woke up yesterday with \\"Brick by Boring Brick\\" in my head, completely at random, so thought \\"why not\\".... besides I had a $5 credit on my account...    Holy crap... I can't stop listening to it.  I love it so much, I just want to wrap my body up in this record...    of course \\"BbBB\\" is a favorite, \\"ignorance\\", \\"playing god\\" and \\"the only exception\\" are also faves...    ok, I love it all... get this one, guys, you won't be sorry.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|This was a really good movie. Clint Eastwood does another good movie role.    Steve  Monroe, NC
B0035V35P8|5.0|I will be honest. The only reason I rented this movie was because of Rain. I knew about him through his singing career and I love him as a singer.... That being said I LOVED this movie. Rain was so good as Raizo. The story was really interesting. He was the perfect person for this role and dedicated himself so much. I was wanting to watch it again the next day(but it had to go back). So I am going to buy it and watch it as much as I can.
0385341679|3.0|A friend gave me the first few in the series last year and I wanted to see it through.  I am mostly just glad that it's finished and I don't have to wonder about the cliff-hanger at the end of the last book anymore.  The plot's been hashed out over too many books.  It could have been a tight trilogy, but instead it was a skimmable series.  I found myself skimming large parts of this book just to get to the parts with actual plot advancement.  Looking back, I think if I had just read parts 1 and 5, I would have been just as happy.    **Spoiler**    And the more I thought about it, the weirder it was for me that Barrons is this beast thing. Forever. So he can just turn into a fanged-beast when he gets mad that she forgets to lock the doors? And he can't die? Ever? So, she grows old and life goes on and he just watches it all?  It just doesn't play out for me.  Just kind of Eeeew.
0385341679|5.0|I admit, for awhile, I was hesitant about continuing to read this series. Not because fever series didn't start out riveting, and unique, it did. Not because the author couldn't write. She can, and I had bought everything she wrote. I Loved this series....until one book in this series just became such an anathema to me that I thought, \\"I don't know if I can wade past this horrible serialized teaser book to even read another one of these.\\" I can say though, that this book was worth the angst. It's my favorite in this series, and it delivers what was started in this series. It surpassed what I had always liked about Karen Moning. Where do I start with this book? Like I mentioned, I really didn't have high hopes, but I'd invested enough time in the series, so I thought, well, lets just see where she delivers these characters. Simply sublime from start to finish, like eating a wonderfully complex desert followed by a latte, discovering someone else paid the bill. I liked the cadence of the book, how everything was tied and revealed  with these characters and how the end relationships made sense were made not in a Disney way, but a way that made sense for the book and characters. The only weak spot was of Cruce and the end gambit. However, I ENJOYED this book very much, and the series was just outstanding. Congratulations to Karen, and anyone lucky enough to have stuck with this series, and especially this book.
1439152780|5.0|I loved the Forgotten Garden and couldn't wait for this new book to come out.  I was a little scared that I wouldn't like this one as much, or that the author had run out of ideas.  I've been disappointed before with third and fourth books by authors that I previously liked, (Dan Brown being one) but this one did not disappoint!  It took me a while to get into it, just like The Forgotten Garden, but once you understood what was going on, I couldn't put it down.  It was a little mysterious, a kind of haunted castle, hidden secret from the past, thing going on.  Even though it was a tad predicable, I was still surprised a few times.  I liked the fact that everyone does not live happily ever after, that's just not real life, but she ties things up in the end in a way that gives hope for the remaining characters.    I really like the way Kate Morton writes.  Her descriptions are so fresh and vivid that I feel like I've been transported to another time and place.  Without recapping the whole book (that's already been done by others) I just want to say that after reading this book I was disappointed in authors that I used to read faithfully.  It seemed like I had taken a literary step down and their descriptions seemed mediocre compared to Kate Morton.       Some have complained about the flashbacks, if you don't like that kind of story, this is not for you.  Kate Morton seems to excel at someone from the present digging up the past.  I guess I've always enjoyed wondering about those who've gone before and the lives that are dead and buried with them.  Tragic secrets that come to light, years after the perpetrators are gone and forgotten.  I just wish The True Story of The Mud Man was a real book, so I could read it too.

I even stayed up until 1:00am (When the book downloaded to my Kindle) to start reading it!<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers -- it is hard to say anything about the book because if you DO it may spoil it for others. (I hate when that happens to me)  I can say this -- it was totally worth the wait!  Fever Fans will NOT be disappointed!<br /><br />I LOVED IT!  I know you will too!

0061715050|5.0|This is a beautifully presented edition. My nephew was delighted at receiving it and after a week or so of not being interested in reading over the summer break, devoured this title. I supplemented it with a DVD of the recent film, but he preferred to read the book.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book was decent but not great.  I expected much more after reading other reviews. It moved slow at first and then dragged on. I wouldn't recommend it.
1594202842|4.0|I personally welcome any provocative book that elicits strong feelings, prompting conversation about raising children. As a parent, this book motivated me to reflect on my own parenting style, and discuss it with others. That's got to be a good thing.<br /><br />Amy Chua's book is a memoir, not a \\"how-to\\" book. Readers will be shocked at some of her in-your-face tactics (this is why I give the book a 4 not 5 stars), but she offers a thought-provoking journey through parenthood that invites us all to re-think how we raise our children.<br /><br />As a parent, I think I come out about halfway between the polarities of Eastern and Western parenting. I agree with a hands-on, involved tutoring approach to raising children, but certainly without Chua's degrading harshness, and with more opportunities for self-expression. Chua's book helped me clarify what is really important to me as a mother.<br /><br />As a college consultant, I wouldn't mind a judicious sprinkling of the Eastern approach in raising American high school students. Parental involvement varies across the board in our society, from abject neglect to hypermanaging. Ironically, helicoptering in our culture seems more about micromanaging a kid's resume and decisions than being engaged with the SUBSTANCE of learning.<br /><br />By contrast, I was struck by Chua's description of Tiger Moms' hands-on role in their children's ACADEMICS: \\"It's true that Chinese mothers get in the trenches, putting in long grueling hours personally tutoring...\\" That's impressive. Among my clients, I see so many parents who attend every soccer game, but have no idea what their student is studying in history, or what he got on the last test. They're obsessive, all right, but not about the things that will get their children ahead in life.<br /><br />In my practice, I see many parents who are so long on self-esteem (or at least ego) and so short on drive to build their child's competencies, that they unwittingly create unrealistic expectations for college admission. The child is given a false sense of entitlement to be accepted at an elite college, without the qualifications for today's competitive college marketplace.<br /><br />\\"By contrast,\\" Chua says in her book, \\"the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they're capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits, and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.\\"ld is given a false sense of entitlement to be accepted at an elite college, without the qualifications for today's competitive college marketplace.    \\"By contrast,\\" Chua says in her book, \\"the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they're capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits, and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.\\"
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be able to see Tron:  The Legacy opening weekend in IMAX 3D.  I also saw the movie in regular 3D.  Of the two formats I've seen the film in I can honestly say that seeing it in IMAX 3D is the way to go since it offers a more immersive experience.    Tron:  The Legacy is the sequel to the moderately successful 1982 film Tron which was released 28 years ago.  Newcomers to the series (like myself since I never saw the original film) will find it easy to get into the world that the film creates since the movie centers around the original heroes' son a young man named Sam Flynn who is also a newcomer to the computer world of Tron.  As he learns about this new world, we the viewers get to learn about this digital world.       The movie begins in 1989, where we (the viewers) are introduced to a seven year old Sam being told a bedtime story by his father Kevin Flynn.  After Kevin tells the wide-eyed and eager young Sam part of this magical story, he puts him to bed, and promises to finish the story later.  This doesn't happen since Kevin goes missing, leaving behind his young son.    Fast-forward twenty years and Sam has grown up from an innocent boy to a directionless young man who wastes his potential and plays annual pranks on his dad's company ENCOM International.  Luckily for Sam his life of mediocrity comes to an abrupt end when he accidentally causes himself to be transported to the digital world.  It is here in this futurstic, black, barren, and very shiny world of Neon lights that Sam meets two versions of his father.  The first version of his father that Sam meets is CLU 2 (Codified Likeness Utility 2, being that Clu 1 was derezzed in the first Tron movie).  Clu 2 is a program that looks like his user Kevin Flynn did when he was younger.  Clu 2 also lacks any traces of humanity including any kind of care for Sam which makes their first meeting a sad one.    Sam also meets is real dad who has now grown old and wise from hard lessons he's learned from bad decisions and an unrealistic desire to create a perfect system.        During Sam's meeting with his father, he learns that his father's creation Clu 2 revolted against him and that Clu 2 has not wavered from his father's dream of perfection.  He also learns that his father has been trapped in this digital world for 20 years.  Naturally, Sam wants to escape this digital world and take his father with him; however, leaving is a much harder thing to do than arriving.  If you want to know more about the escape plan and the adventure associated with it I'd recommend you watch the film.     Visually speaking,  Tron:  The Legacy is certainly very pretty to look at, has a great musical score, fantastic fight sequences, and great costume designs (they're modern, hip, sleek, and sexy).  These visuals are especially impressive with the graphics they used to de-age Jeff Bridges and transforming him into a younger version of himself). It's an effect that has to be seen to be believed especially when young Jeff comes face-to-face with old Jeff.      Rating: A-
0375842209|5.0|At first I was very hesitant to read this book. In fact the only reason why I picked it up is because I had to for my English class. I just finished this book. It made me happy, made me laugh, made me think more about myself and my own life, and ultimately, it made me cry. I will not give anything away because that wouldn't be fair to you. You must read this book for yourself and draw your own conclusions from it. I will say that I have never appreciated a book more. I absolutely loved it. I will read it again and again. My children will read it. My children's children will read it. This book is timeless. Please I beg you to read it.

076115678X|5.0|I purchased this book after having read the first edition.  This book is much better.  I'm multi-ethnic with 3b/3c type curls.  I've been doing the CG method for about 8 months.  My hair looked great immediately after stopping shampoo.  This DVD that comes with this book is great, especially if you cut your own curls as I do.  I highly recommend this book.  Shipping was fast also.
0061537934|2.0|I had heard nothing but rave reviews for this book and was told to have a box of tissues handy.  Was I surprised when I began reading it (finished it in less than a day) and found out that is was so trite and predictable.  Nothing about the story rang true and I think it was so contrived and not inspiring at all.  Huge disappointment.
1401323952|5.0|I bought this book for my sister, who like me, is a Foodie. She is totally impressed with the book and lets face it, all of Nigella's books are wonderful eye candy but they are full of good ideas and wonderful recipes too.
B003GK22HA|5.0|Wilbur Smith is my favourite author of high paced adventure stories. River God is no exception to the rule. Taita, the eunuch, is one of Mr Smith's most fascinating creations, and the teeming life on the banks of the Nile 4000 years ago portrayed in his words is so vivid. I come back to this book every 5 years or so and I enjoy each reading as much as the first. I have bought it on my Kindle, even though I have the paperback at home, so that I will always have it to hand when I fancy rereading it.  My only quibble with the Kindle version is that the author's note at the end of the book has been omitted. This is only one and a half pages, yet it demonstrates Mr Smith's skill as a storyteller by leading the reader to believe that the book is a retelling, in modern form, of historical scrolls discovered in Queen Lostris's tomb. It also helps to smooth the reader's way into the sequel, The Seventh Scroll. Why has Amazon left this short but hugely important text out? Please replace it, it's absolutely necessary.
0061433047|5.0|It brings together characters who had never met before and ties more than a few loose ends from previous books (even as far back as Equal Rites). The sad thing is that Terry Pratchett seems to be rushing to finish telling everything while he can. I wish he could continue writing for many years to come.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Karen Moning has written a wonderful series, and this book is hands-down the best book she has written. The threads woven throughout the Highlander series and the Fever series culminates in a book that is difficult to put down.

This book will make you laugh, cry, and think of the things that are most important in your own life.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|Set in Roman Egypt during the late years of the Roman Empire and partially based on real History this film has some very interesting scenes but then it also has some that fail to hit the mark.  The cinematography is awesome but the story tries to do so much and on such a complex topic that it would have been better served as a miniseries than a historical picture.  That said, it's worth a look, especially for History buffs.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B;  STORY/PLOTTING: B minus  UNDERTAKING ATTEMPT: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2010; MY GRADE: B minus to B.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I love this move. Great music. Spectacular performances. This movie first turned me on to Gerard Butler as an actor.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Winner of the Golden Globes for Best Drama.  This series gets better and better much like a fine wine.  While I enjoyed season one this follow up season was even better.  MM is the type of show that rewards the especially astute viewer.  There is so much subtext that you could teach a course about it.  The relationships are so deep and multi layered that MM should serve as a model for future TV shows that want to get it right.  Women will love the fashion most especially and men seem to love the playboy lifestyle minus the guilt.  The characters are flawed but always a distinctive pleasure to watch.  Even the \\"worst\\" episode gets a B to B plus grade.  The last episode is set with the Cuban Missile Crisis in its background and just about everyone fears they're going to get nuked yet they still have to deal with immediate personal problems.  The director gives commentary on almost every episode from a storytelling point of view which I appreciate very much. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: A to A plus; STORY/PLOTTING: A; GETS THE PERIOD RIGHT: A minus; THEMES: A minus to A; WHEN WATCHED: November to December 2010.  MY GRADE: A.
B0000024IE|5.0|Public Enemy, what else can you say about these guys?  One of the most well known rap artists than proved who artistic the genre can be, Public Enemy still stands out on it's own when it comes to rap, and they are a cornerstone rap band to the genre.  Will all due respect to their breakout It Takes A Nation of MIllions, I have to we reasonable with myself and claim that Fear of Black Planet is my favorite Public Enemy album than the former.  It quite simply is home to some of the best rap EVER, even though it's not quite perfect in some ways.<br /><br />I do want to stress something, that this album does seem to have a bit amount of filler.  Public Enemy, in my opinion, sometimes have a weakness in their music, when the music sometimes doesn't really engage.  Sometimes they seem content on making their music as heavy, as angry, and amelodic as possible, the point where it comes sort of, well, boring.  Case in point would be War at 33 1/3, which is dull and boring to listen to, it just doesn't work.I'm not sure if it's personal tastes or not, but I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you I didn't care for songs such as the Title Track, Pollywantacracka, Who Stole the Soul and some others.  Call me picky, but well, they don't really engage or work very well, which is sort of a shame.<br /><br />Despite all this, why am I giving this a near perfect score?  Simple: The material on here that kicks is AWESOME, some of the BEST Hip-Hop, ever.  Some of the songs don't quite work for me, for the reasons above.  That said, when these guys cook, hang on to your hat because you will most likely lose it.  Kinetic, dense, urgent, and funky as hell, black politics (no, they are NOT racist) have never been as fun, assertive, and serious all in one package.  Chuck D's distinctive booming vocals are catchy, melodic, angry, and , and of course there's Flavor Flav, who gives a sense of fun and also proves he can rap on the microphone.  Of course, the production values have no dated, and are as dense as the rapping.  Dare I say it, it's even better than It Takes a nation.., and everybody knows how awesome that album was.  Filled with hard hitting beats, noisy sirens and whistles, heavy hitting bass, and more fire and energy than a Steel mill, it's still distinctive and nothing else can compete with it.<br /><br />Highlights? Oh man, where to start?  Brother Gonna Work it Out is one of the funkiest, heaviest, and songs in rap, it's rhythms are so damn good they turn your body on and electrify every dancing bone in your body.  You'll do things you never thought you could, even if you are meek on the dance floor (as I currently am, ha).  Other songs like Revolutionary Generation (with it's absolutely massive bass and beat) and Reggie Jax follow suit.  911 is a Joke and Can't Do Nuttin For Ya Man are prime showcases for Flavor Flav's skills.  Welcome to the Terrodome is one of the most exhausting hip hop songs I've ever listened to.  With raiding sirens, massive almost rocking beats, it blares across the land, and it WILL make you dance wide like a maniac doing a cardio exercise.  And this is before Burn Hollywood Burn and Power to the People!  OF course, it ends with Fight the Power, which will make you want to instantly dance like Rosie Perez did her dance in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing.  You get the point?  Man, I can't even put in words how good listening to this is.  The skits here are great, as they are little funky intros to, often, very powerful track that is after.<br /><br />Amazingly, the lyrics here aren't even the star, considering that the music is so damn wicked you could almost listen to it without any rapping.  This album has been quite analyzed to death, but believe me, once these guys get into your skin, it doesn't go away. Fear of Black Planet is certainly unique today, and it sounds even more fresh today than it must have been, back in the day. Essential to the argument of Rap music's artistic value, and the fact that it ISmusic, no matter what any naysayers say.ayers say.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I love this movie! it is fun for people of all ages. I would definitely recommend this movie to people.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|If you loved the previous 4 books in this series, this will be your ultimate finale. It was brilliant. Loved the ending that left the door open for future books.    I'm not going to mention one spoiler here - if you are curious about the ending, read it yourself. It unfolds in such a wonderful fashion that any mention of one little thing will ruin the journey.    Let me just say - it was worth the wait! I'm sad it is over, though.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|Wow, it is almost impossible for me to think of another thing, much less any other movie, that has been so fantastically overrated than this. It's almost as if the soundtrack, which is very good, made everyone believe that something was actually happening in this movie. A kid comes up with a prank, 2 Harvard guys give him an idea, he takes that idea and writes a website that becomes hugely popular, and gets sued. Why is this movie brilliant? What am I missing? Why should I care what happens to any of these people? Sure it's a well directed movie but the subject matter is absolutely devoid of anything worth paying attention to. It is mildly entertaining but not more than most other movies. I just don't get it.

Their latest mission backfires and counterfeit money plates are stolen by a rival mercenary team. Hannibal and his \\"A-Team\\" are framed and sent to prison. But high security prisons, mercenaries, and traitors are no match for this team that specializes in the crazy and impossible.<br /><br />The A-Team, based on the legendary 80's television show are played by Liam Neeson (Hannibal), Bradley Cooper (Face), Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson (B.A.), and Sharlto Copley (Murdock). Neeson plays every role to perfection, and this is no exception. Hannibal is the man who always has a plan, brilliant and a bit crazy. Speaking of crazy, Murdock is certifiably insane, but an ace pilot and the team's constant comic relief. Copley does a wonderful job of acting like he should be committed. Cooper is Faceman aka Templeton Peck - the pretty boy, master of disguise and master of manipulation. There's a bit of craziness to him as well, but we get to see a deeper side of him when his former love (played by Jessica Biel) is on their trail. And Jackson gets to play the iconic character of B.A. Baracus - the tough as nails former Airborne Army Ranger who becomes afraid of flying.<br /><br />With over-the-top action, incredible stunts, and impossible situations, The A-Team is much like the original series - if the original series were allowed to actually shoot people. All of the fun-loving spirit, adventure, and comedy from before with a re-vamp of fantastic characters and a fun (if somewhat predictable) story. This was my favorite of 2010's summer action blockbusters. And I was more than excited to own it on Blu-ray, with all of its special features and extras. This edition also includes a digital copy of the theatrical version. Huge explosions, lots of laughs, and plenty of surprises - The A-Team certainly exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Special Features Include:<br />Disc 1:<br />*  Theatrical Version<br />*  Extended Version<br />*  The Devil's in the Details: Inside the Action with Joe Carnahan<br />*  Deleted Scenes<br />*  Gag Reel<br />*  A-Team Theme Mash-Up Montage<br />*  Plan of Attack<br />*  Character Chronicles<br />*  Visual Effects Before and After with Commentary by Visual Effects Supervisor James E. Price<br />*  Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />Disc 2: Digital Copyn   *  The Devil's in the Details: Inside the Action with Joe Carnahan   *  Deleted Scenes   *  Gag Reel   *  A-Team Theme Mash-Up Montage   *  Plan of Attack   *  Character Chronicles   *  Visual Effects Before and After with Commentary by Visual Effects Supervisor James E.

B00447G2PM|4.0|I bought my Samsung LED TV back in Decemeber of last year. It came with 3D technology. The technology is very good. However, there are not many 3D movies that are available for purchase in retail stores. The ones that are in store are very expensive. I finally found this blu-ray. Even though it is not the type of movie I want to buy. But at least I get to experience the 3D techonology on my TV with a real 3D movie. And the price is decent. I was hoping for it to be cheaper. So I can buy more. Over all, the 3D quality on this blu-ray is excellent. However, the movie is very short. So I am going to give it a four stars.
1400079276|5.0|The Amazon Review phrase \\"Miss Saeki, whom he fantasizes may be his long-lost mother\\" should have \\"who\\" where it has \\"whom,\\" because the pronoun is the subject of the clause \\"who . . . may be his long-lost mother.\\"  I'm getting this for my kid, whose generation has heard of this author
B001TI7DG6|5.0|Life of Pi was a delight.  The reader will be totally engaged by the wry humour as he roots for Pi's survival against the backdrop of drama and tragedy.  The reader suspends his disbelief of the unbelievable and goes along for the ride, marvelling at the detail and scientific detail of a tall tale.  The writing style is easy to digest and is poetic all at the same time. My favourite passage is the one on fear on Page 178.  Here is a line from that passage:  \\"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent.  Only fear can defeat life.  It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know.  It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy.  It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unerring ease.\\"       The book's story, on the surface about survival, also addresses the issues of faith and the truth that ultimately what is real for us, be it god or our breakfasts, is all a matter of the choices we make.
0385341679|5.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />OMG! What an exciting ride it has been! And how satisfying! So much depended on the quality of this last installment and, thank goodness, Moning didn't disappoint. \\"Shadowfever\\" is not one of those series finales that you want to forget ever reading. Quite the opposite. There is a lot to be said about benefits of series' outlining. I strongly believe that a series with no pre-planning has almost no chance of succeeding. We are lucky Moning knows her stuff.<br /><br />This last installment is a twisty tale, with so many revelations and surprises, your head will spin. After speculating for months who was who or what and what everyone's motives were, I have to admit, I guessed correctly almost none of it. It takes talent to write an ending that is so satisfying and with the outcome we all wanted, and make it so exciting and unpredictable until the very last page.<br /><br />\\"Shadowfever\\" is not a seamlessly written book. A couple of aspects of the novel were not foreshadowed properly. I also found the 1st part of the book a little hard to connect with. It gave me painful flashbacks of being in Katniss' head in \\"Mockingjay\\" (I love that book by the way). But the moment the 2nd part begins, oh my, there is no stopping that train! I ended up staying up most of last night telling myself - just one more chapter...<br /><br />I feel exhilarated and uplifted after finishing \\"Shadowfever.\\" Do not worry, it ends well, even though the path to HEA is a thorny and angsty one. Yes, the series became darker and darker over time, but Moning wasn't lying assuring us that Fever series was about light and not darkness. Indeed it is. \\"Shadowfever\\" is about light, about survival and, of course, love. Love makes appearance in many unexpected forms in this novel.<br /><br />I also have to give Moning a special credit the fae world she had created. It is by far the most creative, complex and convoluted (in a good way) take on fae mythology I have ever encountered.<br /><br />I look forward to reading Fever books again and again in all their sexy, violent, intriguing glory. And there are more Fever universe books on the way. Isn't that great?><br />I look forward to reading Fever books again and again in all their sexy, violent, intriguing glory.

B0026PW67W|4.0|The map is huge, and the quality of the material is great.  However, if you know anything about the hp world, it'll only take a few seconds before you notice important stuff missing and repititions.  However, the feel of it generally is well done.
B0020BUWX2|2.0|*SPOILER  When I read the many reviews on this book I thought it would be a fantastic read. When I finally got my hands on a copy of it I plowed through the story within hours. After I finished it I was disappointed. The story build up and up and the ending is a freaking letdown. I felt the story lacked any real depth and all that finally kept mia earth bound was a boy? Yes, said boy was amazing to her but why does every teen girl book have to end with the boy saving the day? Just once I would like to read a book were the heroine is independent and figures things out for herself not with the hearthrobe BF in the backgound. Why do teen girl books need a BF character for her to find her true vaule or true potential or beauty??
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of brothers is my favorite war series of all time. It is a must watch for any war, history or country buff.
0385341679|3.0|I do not write reviews often but since I have been reading this series for years I felt I needed to. First off, Karen Marie Moning is an amazingly talented writer! The Highlander Series is one of my all-time favorites and I absolutely loved every book in the Fever Series. That being said I really was upset having to wait five years for a resolution. I felt Shadowfever got a little wordy and the whole series could have been finished in a trilogy. I also was never a fan of Dani and the \\"fecking\\" parts come off as immature and annoying versus cute. I would rather have heard the story from Barrons perspective or even Christians. I felt that too many questions remained unanswered and that the whole epic battle we waited on never really happened. It was a bit of a letdown. I will also be a big fan of Moning but I will not start reading another series until all the books are published.
B004J00KJ8|4.0|Gave it a 5 for finally coming out but a 3 for being a one store exclusive. Anyone who is wanting this, it's a Target store exclusive. $9.99 + tax
0307454541|4.0|The author spends so much time in the beginning setting up the story and characters that I almost didn't continue reading.  I was actually asked about the book while reading at a park and told a lady not to bother reading it.  However, once I got past the Swedish political and financial mumbo and really got into the story I couldn't put it down.  I love Lisbeth Salander's character and Blomvkist too.  But, why did he have to be a womanizer?  I don't get that. If you are able to get into this story you will read it quickly and then move on to the next two books in the trilogy.  I really loved this story! I read all 3 since Christmas!
B003O6R3Z2|5.0|First off, let me say that this took forever to download as an MP3.  Oh man.  21 CDs. I might have been better off spending the extra money and getting the actual set, then ripping it to my computer.  No matter.  I'm usually back and forth on Fischer-Dieskau's voice because of some of the types of vibrato he uses or his articulations, but I'm consistantly pleased with his work on this set. It's simply gorgeous.  It really has that nice full sound he has, but he really works the pieces in a way that he knows when to be simple and when to be romantic with everything. I don't think I would do anything differently, were I a singer instead of an instrumentalist. I really enjoy the balance of the piano and the voice.  As these were all taken from poems, the collection seems to make note of that by always having the voice ride ontop of the piano. Not overpowering, but the voice is always clearly heard.  And Fischer-Dieskau knows how to speak with clear, precise diction.  A person learning the language could listen to this and translate if they wanted.<br />Technical aspects aside, this is a beautiful collection, extremely well done with obvious care and thought.  I was recommended this collection by professors and colleagues alike, and I could not be happier.
0823015033|5.0|As I type this, the book is sitting by my side; it's pages creased and worn because I've been shoving into purses of various sizes as I cart it around with me while working on various projects. I am a complete beginner and I LOVE. LOVE. LOVE this book. It goes into great detail, step by step showing you the ways to sculpt bodies of various shapes and sizes, each individual part of the body, how to give it a base, sculpt the hair, and even the clothing! She gives you directions for creating your own tools to replicate some of the techniques found in the book- She has a great eyeball sculpting technique and shows you how to create a stand on which to bake them. The author even gives you the measurements you'll need for figures of different sizes, which is sooo helpful to me, because I have so much trouble with measurements. I love this book and refer to it constantly. Even as my abilities have grown in the 2 years that I've had it, I still find the book useful. I think that it will still be useful to me even when my skills have advanced to a professional level. I don't think I'll need another people-sculpting book again!
1416572287|4.0|While the title of the book just refers to physics in general, the book actually focuses on quantum physics or the physics of very small things.  The book is directed at the physics novice, and the author does a nice job of describing a very complicated topic by pretending to discuss it with his dog.  I found the discussion with the dog gave the author easy to understand examples that could help to explain the very difficult quantum physics topics.  For example, using a bunny rabbit in a yard as an example of a subatomic particle.  In the book, the author covers the topics of 1) How an item can act as both a particle and a wave. 2) How it is impossible to tell both the position and momentum of a particle. 3)The idea of many worlds. 4)Teleportation. And several other things related to quantum physics.  I came away from the book entertained and with some basic knowledge about a very complicated area of science.  That was just what I wanted.
B002AKPECW|5.0|Reynolds' earlier books never quite fit my tastes, but this one has left me pleasantly intrigued since I first read it a few months ago. I rarely re-read a book within 2 or 3 years, but this one called me back after 2-3 months.    Reynolds amazingly tackles the task of showing the reader the epic expanse of both time and space, by cleverly disguising several recycled space opera elements, while completely denying the possibility of two typical science fiction staples: No living aliens to have been found in 6 million years of the human meta-civilization, and no transluminal travel/communications.    Masterfully woven, House Of Suns will leave you drooling for a sequel, but content if Reynolds never delivers one.
0470913029|3.0|I found this book a little light on science given the credentials of its author. Having read some of Cordain's journal papers I know every word he's saying in the book is backed up by research, but I would have loved to see the connections made more clear. I'm sure this was a conscious decision on his part, but for me, the book came off a little too generalistic. While the recipes themselves are good, I thought a plan on how to use them was missing, as in a meal plan. Robb Wolf did a better job of this in his recent book, giving a 30-day mealplan and shopping list available on his website.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I wish they would release a set that had been cleaned up, but also didn't have any of the extra garbage that Lucas added. Those extras have made the original trilogy unwatchable. You know, it's funny, but Lucas will go on and on about how he would have shot the original movies if \\"the right technology\\" had been available. I'm glad he didn't have those tools back in the 70's or these movies probably would have sucked. The prequels are an example of what happens when he gets to play with technology. Without all of the computer generated crap, he had to focus on minors things like story and plot. I'll guess I'll keep waiting for a decent set to be released. Sigh...
B004DK49DW|5.0|I loved this album.  Not my favorite Social Distortion ever but I think its awesome.  I love love love early SD but I also am a huge fan of the later albums and of Mike Ness solo, which this reminds me of.
1400079276|5.0|...Of course, this is just my opinion. It takes a lot for me to dub a book my favorite, or even \\"The Greatest Book of All Time\\", but this one has done it. Before, the greatest book I had ever read was Lolita by Vladmir Nabokov, and that held the top spot on my bookshelf for seven years. Now it has been replaced.<br /><br />It's not a stretch by any means to say that Murakami is my favorite author, or that I am intrigued by Japan...because he is, and I am a Japanese major. However, this book is not for people who are obsessed with Japan per se, seeing as how it has a lot of Western cultural references. Murakami loves Jazz, Classic Rock, American movies and the like. His novels are set in Japanese, but they are and are not uniquely Japanese.<br /><br />The main thing with Murakami's novels is the distinct mixture of the mundane and the surreal. You may feel as if you are reading about a totally ordinary character, and then something switches and blows every notion you had right out of the water. Whether it's talking to cats, fish raining from the sky, or an Oedipal prophecy come true, these characters are not normal. Or boring.<br /><br />I had read nine of Murakami's novels prior to this one, with Hard-Boiled Wonderland and Wind-Up Bird waiting in the wings. However, I can't bring myself to open another book by him. Kakfa On The Shore is just so perfect and magical to me, that I do not want to spoil it.
B0045ZAQSM|4.0|I caught this at my local cinema and had very few expectations except that I knew the protagonist looked a lot like Jim Morrison and that the film got its title from a Doors song. The script to this film is very tight, particularly because it centers the action around one location (a rundown fast-food joint) and then populates it with a diverse cast of characters, all with their peculiar quirks and believable motivations. The plot moves well and it would be hard to finish this film without smiling. Definitely worth watching.
030746363X|5.0|This book is awesome.    I am an advanced trainer looking to learn something new and I found it!!
B001UJSW6Y|5.0|This is an absolutely excellent recording of one of the most underated operas in history! To listen to the superb singing of every member of this cast - Scotto in the title role, Domingo as Maurizio, and Milnes as Michonnet, all under the sure and excellent hand of James Levine, is to be transported to a world of sound, colour, drama, and passion to rival much of what Verdi and Puccini wrote.<br /><br />  Having listened to this recording many, many times, the only conclusion that I can come to as to why \\"Adriana\\" is not performed or recorded more is that these are hard economic times, and there is only so much time, resources and money to produce operas. The powers that be, therefore, must devote themselves to the tried and true big name staples that keep the opera houses open.  Yet, happily, you do not need to go to the opera house to hear \\"Adriana.\\" You can purchase this important and satisfying recording of it.  If you admire Italian verismo opera you will not be disappointed by this opera or this recording!
B003INBOEM|5.0|almost perfect movie , will be the greatest of all time. watch over hundred time already, still love this movie , and now same to son watch over and over again.

1594484775|5.0|It is a little daunting to write a review of a book in which one of the central bits is about maniacal fans who post lengthy reviews on on-line media, slobbering on in their excess fandom as pretentious blowhards. So I'll try keep it brief & avoid being a Hornbyologist. Let me just say, then, that this is easily Hornby's best since High Fidelity, and possibly better than HF. The characters are all very well drawn, quirky and flawed and funny, not only the 3 central characters, but second tier characters as well. I found most all of them sympathetic on one level or another. The dialogue is fast paced and smart. This one will be a movie inside of two years, count on it (it even reads a bit like a script), so do yourself a favor & read it before you see it. Hopefully, the movie will be better than the film version of HF.   At the end of the day, an online review should give prospective purchasers an opinion as to whether they should spend their hard earned cash on the particular disk, or book, or whatever, so here's the bottom line: If you loved HF, you will definitely love Juliet, Naked.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this movie, but was curious about it.  But as I watched it - cracking up again and again - I realized that all of us have witnessed how fast rumors fly like wildfire in high school, and ultimately what it does to your self esteem, reputation, and friends' thoughts of you.<br />Great movie, great story, and great laughs!  (I especially LOVE her parents - they are a HOOT!!)
B002UTNKWE|5.0|This recording of \\"Un Ballo in Maschera\\" is excellent.  The soloists are all superb! This should come as no surprise as they include Leontyne Price, Carlo Bergonzi and the late Shirley Verret and Robert Merrill, all in their vocal prime.  The orchestra plays extremely well under Erich Leinsdorf, who was a seasoned and experienced opera conductor.  This recording even boasts some \\"luxury casting\\" in a young Reri Grist, in her prime, as Oscar, and Ezio Flagello, as Samuel.  There are other good recordings of Ballo out there, but most of them stand on a few excellent singers, while other singers on the same recording can be dreadful. This recording is unique in that it is one of the few of Ballo, or any opera for that matter, in which all the roles, major and minor, are sung magnificently, to the accompaniment of a fine orchestra under a fine conductor.
B002ZG9774|5.0|i was so skeptical when I heard about this film but It is surprisingly AMAZING! Christina Aguilera's acting skills are quite polished and well executed! Cher is fantastic, witty, and charming all in one fabulous package! Cam G, Kristin Bell, Julianne H, Stanily Tucci  Mr. Cummings and Eric Dane compliment the main characters spanning from rivals, to lovers to co workers!<br /><br />The story line is cute, the musical numbers are outrageously entertaining, and the visuals are electrifying! Its a lovely feel good film I would highly recommend! buy this film and you will love it!
0316098337|2.0|When I first read a review about the book, I felt that I need to buy it. Without any hesitation, I did and started reading it. I stopped after the first few pages as I realized how sad and gloomy it was. Then I decided to finish what I've started.     To tell you the truth, as I progressed in my reading the book turned out to be a disappointment. It did not live up to the review I've seen and only parts of the novel appeared captivating enough to want you to keep on reading. The writer gives too much credit to a 5 year old and wants us to believe that he is capable of all this knowledge, analysis and rationalization. At the end it seems to be an opportunistic attempt to make money following the incidence in Sweden. Also, I felt it neither concentrated on the captivity nor gave the freedom part its due....
030746363X|5.0|Hallo Tim,  ich habe dein erstes Buch mehrfach gelesen und es inspiriert mich jedes mal aufs Neue. Die übersetzte Ausgabe deines Buches kommte hoffentlich noch dieses  Jahr raus.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I grew up seeing the original trilogy in theaters. Yes I would love for Lucas to release the originals all cleaned up and the way they we're originally shown in theaters. But if you love Star Wars I say enjoy this release. Granted I own the re-released Special Editions. I saw them in the theater but refused to watch them on dvd. 2-Disc set had the originals, not remastered but still incredible. I won't pass up this chance to view the movies on blu-ray. It's not the way most of us would prefer but Lucas didn't alter every scene in the originally trilogy. Believe me I understand some of the negativity. I believe the pros outweigh the cons. I know we all grow tired of giving our hard earned money to keep buying the same movies over and over. In the end it's still a win for us Star Wars fans. Do you know how many movies have not or might never be released on blu-ray or regular dvd. Enjoy it while you can. Don't give into hate. That leads to the dark side.
B000000OUJ|5.0|I NEVER....never write reviews...but this album is probably the greatest album ever. When I first listened to this album, I would've never in a million years imagined that \\"Rap\\" or Hip-Hop would be so incredibly horrible. I listen to this when I want to trace back to the times that Hip-Hop was on point. I absolutely hate 99% of commercial rap, can't ever sit down and watch MTV, BET or listen to the radio because it gives me a headache. But I thank God I can come to the past and listen to this CD. I have much respect for every true lyricist/rapper that continues to do what they do without giving in to this era...that seems to be lasting too damn long.
0385341679|5.0|I adore this series and Shadowfever immensely. I couldn't give enough praise to Karen for the way the series was beautifully constructed and how Mac's adventure has kept us on edge and wanting to turn each page faster than Usain Bolt. I couldn't put my kindle down; I read for 6 and a half hour straight. The story gave us answers to all of our questions, but at times I couldn't help feel that I wanted Karen to expand more on \\"The Damned\\" (Barrons, Ryodan etc) and if the Sidhe-seers are in fact the last unseelie caste that were created to guard the book. I also felt a little let down by the ending, I am happy that Mac and Barrons have finally got it together but there is Cruce/V'lane on the loose with some very powerful information, Mac needs to make up with Dani and that Christian MacKeltar is now an Unseelie Prince (Calling for a Highlander book? I hope so!).    I give the book a five-star rating, simply because Shadowfever has been an amazing and addictive read.    \\"The end\\" *Turns over page* \\"For now...\\" - Yes, maybe an extremely but worth while wait for a spin-off series? Please? I beg you.    Overall, I am absolutely in love with this series and I give the best praise for Karen!
0393068382|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It's quick, witty, knowledgeable, and shows exactly how we are missing many opportunities by raising our children with such stringent ideas about gender and what that means for individual achievement.  In particular, this is a book that every new or expecting parent should read to help them understand why they shouldn't limit their child's potential simply based on sex, and why they should encourage the child to expand outside stereotyped interests and academic areas.

0399536108|5.0|Author Chris Guillebeau, the creator of the Art of Non-Conformity website, delivers his usual honest, direct, and wise advise on living the exact life you want.  Even if you're an AONC follower, this book offers fresh insight that makes it a great companion for Chris's blog.  A proponent of the abundance supercedes scarcity model of living, Chris offers encouragement and real-life examples of how to live your life fully (although, perhaps unconventionally) while making the world a better place.  Even if you're not interested in \\"changing the world,\\" this entertaining book offers lots of ways to live intentionally and well.
B000007MVD|5.0|Live at the BBC is, quite honestly, my favorite Beatles recording. On every cut the band sounds tight and powerful. Original and cover tunes are absolutely bristling with a raw energy and excitement that can not be denied! The freshness and conviction the Fab Four pours into this compilation's tracks can not be described- it must be HEARD. Live at the BBC is a MUST HAVE not just for Beatles fans, but for any fan of great Rock n' Roll music, and additional proof of the never-to be-duplicated magic that was John, Paul, George and Ringo. FIVE STARS!!!
B003K5A6VK|5.0|What a great episode, especially for mystery fans.  As both an Agatha Christie fan and a Doctor Who fan, I was so happy that both mystery and science-fiction were combined in this episode.  Agatha Christie did disappear in real life for about ten days, so I am glad that the writers decided to play off of that and create an interesting story.  It was also nice to see Felicity Kendall again, who earlier appeared in both \\"Rosemary & Thyme\\" and \\"Good Neighbours\\".
B003EYVXUU|5.0|There are so many layers to this movies, it's hard to know exactly how to describe it. The gore factor is kept to a minimum, allowing the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. But in spite of the movie being a horror/vampire film, it's really about how far a boy is willing to go to have a true friend in his life. After seeing so many horrible/poorly acted movies, I thought this was going to be another one when the first ten or so minutes began...slowly. Then, it began to pick up and kept me engrossed. I found the \\"twist\\" ending pretty obvious, but it didn't matter--the movie is that good.      The two child actors are phenomenal.
B004856SQ8|1.0|I gave up after an hour. This movie is far to silly, and confusing. If there is a story, it is well beyond me. Just trash!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I truly loved this series. I read all five books in two weeks and was so sad when it was over. such a unique series and kept me on my toes threw the whole series. Will not disappoint!
160094048X|5.0|Fantastic book. Easy to understand with some fantastic sections on troubleshooting and tips. Absolutely worth-while if you want to wow vegans, and non-vegans alike.
1400052173|5.0|First, I really enjoyed the book. The times that I was not reading the book, I was thinking about Henrietta and the Lacks family. I noted throughtout the book the authour mentions Henrietta and the Lacks family were very light skinned blacks, almost Latio in complexion and a very good looking family. Even the picture of  Elise (the older sister who died) was commented on as to how pretty she was.    The first part of the book about Henrieeta younger days and starting a family in Clover was excellent in narration.  The authour captured the time and feelings very well. I could not put the book down!    I am a scientist that work with tissue culture, although I have not worked with Hela cells. While the foundation of the book was about the Lacks and the feelings about how they were robbed monetary contribtions from science, we must note that even today, the issue is very controversial.I do know for certain, that tisue samples were take from BOTH black and white patients at that time period.    And what about Day? He seems so \\"background\\" in the book, when in fact, he would have the MOST to tell since he basically grew up with Henrietta. I think most of her early stories came from her cousins. Maybe he felt great guilt for giving Henny syphillis and was in no way reproached by his children (openly) because of how the kids were raised to be quiet and not ask questions.    I was also surprised at how lighly the author took to telling about aldutry, STD, incest, rape and child abuse. ALL horrid things that occured in the Lacks family.    The part of the book set in 2001 with Debroa made me anxious and nervous and I felt so much pity for Debroah.I felt that she had really suffered for not knowing her mom and was the most connected to her. I could only imagine the anguish of knowing everyone in the world talking about your MOM, and not knowing her at all.    Finally, while I think that sueing John Hopkins is Not the way to go; ALL movies, books, documentary, conferences andanything related to the Lacks story, SHOULD give the Lacks family money. I wonder if Debroah got money from the BBC interview?    An overall great book ( surprised that it took ten years of reasearch ), however Rebecca did a good job in showing the humanity in the HeLa cells story.
0061537969|5.0|Just finished the book. whoa. ugly cry. sweet, delicous, love-your-dog, ugly cry.     If you are dog lover, and totally enjoy believing they can understand what you're saying and you are utterly humbled by being so unconditionally loved by a 4-legged creature, you will love this book.     A few weeks ago I stood in Target reading the beginning of this book - I couldn't put it down... tears running down my face, embarrassed that I was probably on a security camera somewhere (but not enough to stop reading), I even skipped toward the end and read more...then put the book down and left the store - I couldn't take it, I was so afraid it was going to be TOO sad to read. After leaving Target I got in my car, called my husband to tell him about it, but couldn't tell him without sobbing. Fast forward to a week later, after I couldn't stop thinking about it and went back and bought it. So grateful I did. Looooooooved it.
B000009DUY|4.0|I once tweeted that when I listen to the music of John Williams, I feel heroic, no matter what I'm doing -- washing the dishes, paying bills, napping. This is no exception. While it doesn't have the showy orchestral bravura of some of Williams's other, better-known work, there's a quiet dignity and heroism to this score that not only evokes scenes from the film but also honors in its gently inspiring way the men and women (but mostly men) who lost their lives in WWII. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of John Williams.
0688014291|1.0|I was required to read this book for a promotional test for my work.  This book is chalked full of clunky metaphors, over generalizations, and pedantic bullsh**.  It is worthless for anyone who is not retarded.
B004DK49DW|1.0|WTF?? Is this a Social Distortion album??? I'm listening to it and all I can hear is country/gospel love songs. I really used to be a big fan of old school SocialD to the point of getting a big Skelly tattoo on my arm. Now I'm going to be kind of embarrassed to show it. I hope Mike wakes up from his love spell because this album is (almost) pure crap. Had I wanted a love song album I would have bought Julio Iglesias. What a disappointment! Sorry Mike. I was expecting a lot more from you. I've also matured (wife, 3 boys, college degree, 34 years old) but I still enjoy the same old good music I've always liked. Growing up doesn't mean I have to listen to this mellow crap.
0240816250|5.0|I am not part of the book's target audience: photographers that work in B&W, specifically those working with the older film-based techniques.  While I had a day or two playing in a darkroom in my early teen years, I'm now a semi-professional photographer using digital technology: digital capture, digital processing, and largely digital (online) display, rather than printing my photos.  But I've always been curious about shooting B&W film and darkroom printing, and I can't imagine a better book on the subject than this one. It's likely the heaviest book on my photography shelf: hardback, and over 500 very-significant pages.  And it's FILLED with info... much of which applies to me now, but much of which does not.  It's definitely targeted at those printing from negatives, and much of the book's content is directed to this end: the properties of various films, chemicals and techniques used in the development process, etc... but plenty also applies to digital photographers: discussions of exposure, lighting, properties of cameras and lenses, the zone system, matting and framing prints, etc.  There is also information specifically for digital photographers, on how to optimize prints, including several ways to get from digital capture to silver-gelatin prints.<br /><br />The book is filled with not only a ton of data-filled charts, tables, and figures (the authors know their stuff!), but also plenty of gorgeous photos, illustrating techniques and methods described (note: there is occasional nudity; this is a fine art photography book).<br /><br />My recommendation: if you shoot B&W film, and/or develop your own prints, you need this book.  It's amazing.  If you're a digital photographer who does mostly color work, and are glad to be rid of the pains of darkroom processing, this book likely isn't for you.  It focuses on traditional analog techniques, and I can't imagine a better book on the subject.  This one has it all.
B004HAG40O|5.0|This album is amazing. It's accessible, beautiful, and evergreen.<br /><br />I loved the previous album (The Hazards of Love), but there was something about it that made it difficult to simply turn on in the middle of the day or during a party. It needed a full audience with full attention. The Kind is Dead works on every level for any listener.
0817439390|2.0|I was a complete and total photography novice and bought this book as my first one...what a mistake! Don't bother with this book unless you already have a basic understanding of photography jargon and how things work. The author is good at explaining whatever he happens to be talking about at the moment, but throws around all kinds of other terms assuming you know what they mean. In particular, you should have a good understanding of what all of the different lenses are before trying to read this book. He also has a tendency to \\"talk down\\" to the reader and assume that his way is the only way to do things. I found the book very grating and could not finish it. He does have some very good examples for understanding the relationship of aperture/shutter speed/ISO, but the frustration factor was just not worth it.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|I had to return this DVD pkg twice.  There was a humming noise in the first DVD pkg through the first 15 minutes.  I returned it.  After I received the 2nd pkg, there was still a humming noise in the beginning 5 minutes and it was OK afterward.  Yet, the second Special Features DVD that came with it did not play at all.  It froze.  My DVD player is fine.  Everything else plays great.  I will purchase The September Issue someplace else, since I had problems with the first two returns.

0767020308|5.0|This version of EMMA seemed very true to the book and I liked Kate Beckinsale as Emma.  Not only did she play the part well, she played it without appearing to be a total idiot. Ms. Beckinsale managed to project vulnerability and innocence that was appealing.  She did not \\"overact\\" as I felt Gweneth Paltrow did in her version.  Mark Strong played the part of Mr. Knightley very nicely, he was strong and passionate. Although he did not have the extreme good looks you expect in a hero, he was perhaps more relatable because of that.  All in all, I really enjoyed this version.
0811847365|5.0|For a drawer and star wars fan like me, that book was definetly a key for inspiration and creativity.<br /><br />It describes the creatures (divided in planets like Naboo and Tatooine) and also explains some of the behavior, environment and different species and genders of the same creature.<br />It has a lot of different and amazing creatures who where cleverly created for specific habitats and planets.<br /><br />It's a must-have for all star wars fans and for all people who wants to get inspired by the amazing wildlife of star wars.
B0043RT8JU|4.0|Margo Roth Spiegelman has always been an unknown quantity ever since she was a child. Her quirky behavior and reclusive, yet outlandish, actions have always made her quite a character to behold. Quentin Jacobsen has lived next door to her all their lives and as children they were quite close. As they grew up though, they grew apart with Quentin focusing on his studies and Margo doing whatever she wanted to do.    One night, a few days before graduation, Margo shows up at Quentin's window and begs him to come on a night of revengeful adventure with her. Reluctantly he agrees, mostly because he's intrigued. They spend all night pulling pranks and getting back at people who made Margo's \\"hit list.\\" In the morning, Quentin realizes the feelings he had for her at a younger child have now matured and he is enamored. To his dismay, and worry, it turns out the next morning that Margo has disappeared.    Quentin sets out on a journey to find the girl he loves with a rag tag team of geeks and clues that she seems to have left specifically for him.    After the first read, I despised this book. There is such a focus on the poem \\"Song of Myself\\" by Walt Whitman, which Margo used as a clue, that I felt like I was back in college dissecting works of literature for every minute detail.    Then I went back and read it again and then one more time. And the more I read it the more I like it. I think I was so focused the first time on figuring out what happened to Margo, that I ignored the more nuanced action. There was so much more going on with the characters that I overlooked while analyzing the poem and other clues. I realized I was acting almost exactly like Quentin in the book. He was so obsessed with piecing the puzzle together, that he missed the whole point of the exercise. Talk about ingenious!    I really enjoyed watching the characters grow and learn to appreciate everything around them. Margo was definitely a \\"carpe diem\\" kind of gal and I found that both refreshing and frustrating. She was very \\"in your face\\" about her actions, while sometimes I questioned her motives. Eventually her reasoning was revealed and that made it much easier to handle on a re-read. Quentin on the other hand went the other way. He went from being the geeky, quiet guy to a parent-ignoring, blowing-off-of-graduation kind of guy. Margo really managed to shake his core.    Truly, I am on-board now with those who says this is a great book. If you haven't already, give this book a chance. I would consider myself proof that it's worth it.
1594202842|2.0|I'm reminded of Shawn Colvin's line \\"The wheels of ambition at a christening...\\"    I've read many of the reviews, but none that I've read seem to conclude what seems so obvious.  Amy Chua's children are her personal publicity stunt.  The more outrageous she can portray her parenting style, the more likely her book will sell.  I believe she did and does practice what she preaches, but the ambition reads raw and has a flavor of personal vengeance.    What if Ms. Chua had genuine problems with one of her children? Unforeseen and difficult obstacles that parents cope with everyday, everywhere.  That's when you know how good a parent someone can become.  I want to hear that story instead; see Anne Lamott for from the heart parenting views.    A successful child reflects so nicely on oneself and might sell a few books. Ivy league colleges are so expensive.

0545123283|5.0|Sam & Grace can't really believe their fortune. After thinking they had lost Sam to the woods as a wolf forever, he sauntered out as a real boy. Permanently. Or at least they hope. With every chill wind, Sam braces for the change that never comes. The couple relax into a comfortable routine of school for Grace, work for Sam, and nights spent together.<br /><br />Then some of the wolves start to shed their pelts. To be specific, Cole is the new wolf who can't seem to hold his wolf form. As a boy he is angry, edgy, and unstable. All he wants is to get lost in his new skin and he's not making his presence any easier on anyone else involved.<br /><br />None of them are alone in their suffering though. Sam is in a constant struggle with his wolf, Grace is harboring a secret within herself, and Cole is trying to hide his true nature. Everyone is trying to protect someone, but really all they're doing is allowing themselves to linger over what could be.<br /><br />So, you know how in many series (mainly trilogies) the second book just feels like filler and pretty much sucks (The Lord of the Rings, Twilight Saga, Gemma Doyle Trilogy)? Well Linger decimates that preconceived notion with such force I swear there was an audible sigh when I came to that realization. I knew Maggie was good, but I wasn't aware of the extinct of her abilities until this book.<br /><br />Linger picks up where Shiver left off and begins to answer a lot of questions that plague readers from the beginning. We discover some pack magic, more of Sam's history, and the reality of the wolves' futures. These things are combined to give us a clearer picture of what is in store for our favorite characters as they travel down an unknown path to an uncertain existence.<br /><br />Of course our favorite people remain very true to character providing tears, laughter, and occasionally a rueful smirk. For example:<br /><br />  \\"The Boy should watch where he's going,\\" she said.<br />  \\"Rachel should not manifest in doorways, \\" (Sam) replied. p. 144 of uncorrected ARC<br /><br />AND<br /><br />  \\"That said, we ought to get you some clothing.\\"<br />  His lips curved more. \\"Eventually?\\"<br />  I smiled nastily at him. \\"Yeah, let's get that freak show covered up.\\"<br />  He made a little whoo shape with his lips. \\"Harsh.\\" p.84 of uncorrected ARC<br /><br />Isabel is every bit as green as always. She has some real depth to her, but her actions undermine her intelligence sometimes. Sam is the strong, silent type for the most part. We see a more personal side of him through his flashback memories & little habits that we discover. Cole is a force to be reckoned with and someone who can balance the fire & ice personality of Isabel. I have a feeling that we'll see even more of them in the final installment.<br /><br />Overall, the world of Mercy Falls continues in this spell-binding, mesmerizing tale. I honestly don't know where the story will go from where it left off, but I can assure you that it won't disappoint. Maggie has created something truly unique & magnetic with the story of the wolves of winter in Minnesota. A must read for 2010, Linger will leave you breathless & wanting more. Bravo!ed ARC     AND        \\"That said, we ought to get you some clothing.\\"      His lips curved more. \\"Eventually?\\"      I smiled nastily at him. \\"Yeah, let's get that freak show covered up.\\"      He made a little whoo shape with his lips. \\"Harsh.\\" p.84 of uncorrected ARC      Isabel is every bit as green as always.

0385341679|5.0|Too many books get rated 5 stars when IMO they are not.  This one was worth EVERY star!   loved how well this book tied it all together.   Even though it was long, I hated to turn the pages because I knew when I was finished, it would not have something this great to look forward to.   KM took her time fleshing out each character so the loose ends didn't feel rushed when getting to the end of the story.  Overall a great series!    The only bad part of this whole series was the length of time it took to write.  I absolutely HATED having to wait for the annual addition each year.   That said, I think if the author had made me wait ONE MORE year to finish this series, I might have been thinking about calling K'Vruck! ;)

B002LYTNR4|5.0|I just finished listening to the cd set, and it took a long time, as first it was in my car, and I only have so much time in my car, but I kept going back to listen again to so many things being said.     The concept is so simple, yet our minds want to make it difficult. And, we are so used to living life by, and through the mind, living in the NOW becomes a practice. A gentle practice of loving yourself, and remembering the truth of who you are, and once you realize that, you always have a choice in this life on how you feel about anything. Suffering is a choice when you are awake to the brilliance and power of you in the NOW!    Peace is available in any situation.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I bought this during the second day sale when it was only $4 and I am completely obsessed with this album now. It was the best $4 ever spent on music, and such a bargain too! Taylor has really outdone herself here though she no longer sounds like country. Most songs on here are relate-able and fun to sing along too.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|This film for me was a vast improvement on Hatchet-I haven't seen Spiral yet. I know Kevin Zegers from the original Air Bud, and I can honestly say he was just as good in this, writer/director Adam Green from Hatchet made a good script, with genuine fear, a creepy atmosphere, and likable charecters, overall. I was impressed with Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell as well. This film should NOT be put in the horror genre, more like a suspence/survival thriller. Independant filmmaking may well be the only way Hollywood can still come up with semi-new ideas. The slasher killer tactic is getting tired, re-makes are getting too predictable, the revenge storyline is getting very tired. But I've known that some people still have some new ideas, the only problem is, will audiences want to see them?  I guess we'll see.
B004DK49DW|5.0|Just received the new Social Distortion album today, and have already been compelled to listen to it multiple times!  Been a fan for decades and I'm very satisfied with their latest effort!  Especially enjoyed tracks #1, #3, #4, and #9, and consider \\"Still Alive\\" the best song on the album, and as fitting an anthem as I've ever heard for us grown-up gen X-r's in 2011.  I love it when a band leaves the best song for last.
1594202842|5.0|When I first read the excerpt in the \\"Wall Street Journal,\\" I knew as an Asian mom, I had to read the book.  I love controversy and I wanted to be able to reference the book if I was to be caught in a debate.    I immediately liked the book.  Ms. Chua has a beautifully simple style of writing and is quite efficient with her words.  She is a master at weaving a story and her sense of humor is a breath of fresh air.  I generally don't find Asian books humorous.  As I was reading through the book, I would laugh out loud at least twice per page.      Ms. Chua does come across as a condescending know-it-all, but the truth of the matter is that she is an accomplished woman who excelled academically and professionally.  She is a driven woman who wanted her two daughters to succeed.  Several times in the book, I thought her actions were a bit extreme, but she always balanced those actions with kindness and tenderness.      Without giving away the ending, I think most people will be pleasantly surprised. One of the things that I found refreshing was her references to different classical music pieces.  As a classical music lover and a pianist, I thought I was getting a college music lecture in between every dramatic incident.  A thought-provoking book that had me entertained throughout while bringing me to tears a couple of times as well.
B001GCUO52|5.0|Ok so I got this on blu ray but with the 3D on it, and it's pretty badass I enjoy the Final Destination movies for their death scenes, and nothing more... They aren't scary really unless death scares you.<br /><br />But I just hope they don't end it with this one because while it is a good film compared to the first 3 id say part 4 is the 3rd best of the bunch with 1, and 2 being the best overall.<br /><br />The acting in the movies have always been good, and it's also been neat to see a franchise that doesn't have a main star! I mean this series doesn't have any 1 star it's a different person who has the vision in each movie which asks the question! Will they ever run out of ideas or sequels? I hope not.<br /><br />Get this on blu ray 3D it's worth every penny. 4/5
B0009PAVI2|5.0|I found the case to be exactly what most others have said, a good value for the money. I keep 2 72MM filters and my lens cap in this pouch attached to my belt when I walk around.     A lot of people don't realize it, but keeping your lens cap clean is just as important as your filters. Why stick the lens cap in your pocket and pick up a boat load of pocket lint. I'd rather put a nice clean cap back on my camera lens, and I don't have to try to remember where I put the cap!    I do agree however that the velcro AND snap is a bit of overkill, but better more than less security!

B003ZMDWRS|5.0|I am completely floored by this release.  I honestly haven't been this psyched about a new release in quite some time.      Just this week, I was thinking to myself that 60's-70's classic rock as we knew it was completely dead, then someone turned me onto this band.      They incorporate so many elements of bands that you may have loved, Traffic, Jethro Tull, even some early Sabbath and Zeppelin like riffs here and there are mixed in and it all sounds fresh, original.    Silsbury Sands, Tiny Circle, One By One from Dorney Reach and Castle Keep highlight the disc but I don't think there is a bad track on here.      Very enthusiastic five stars from this one and I hope these guys can keep them coming.  They have my attention.
B00030DEQE|3.0|Very easy installation, quality looks good, Windows 7 recognized it instantly and installed the drivers without issue. However this adapter would not connect to our router, a fairly new router at that. After hours of checking and rechecking every possible problem, I stumbled across the answer. This LAN adapter will not work properly with a Windows 7 64bit PC with more than 3gb memory. Once I pulled 1gb of memory, viola! We were up and running.

0385341679|5.0|One of the best parts to the Fever series is going back and rereading to see how much was foreshadowed. Almost every thing major is foreshadowed in some way, shape or form. Some more obvious than others. Yes there are questions left unanswered (KMM has signed a three book spinoff deal with her publisher set in the Fever World) but the over all arc of this storey was wrapped off. Though it wasn't a neat, tidy bow where everyone lives happily ever after, there are sacrifices that have to be made, Mac's story comes to its end. I personally cannot wait for the next story to come out to see characters again, and to meet new ones. After reading it I encourage a full scale reread of all five. You might find things you never noticed before! :)
0201721481|5.0|Well written. The examples are excellent and superbly woven in with the text. The non-beginner areas such as allocators are clearly and concisely explained. Well worth the money, a great book for both reference and learning.

B00066FBQG|4.0|The enduring appeal of the 1969 western/comedy &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34; has always been a puzzle. It's not a traditional western and causes bouts of frustration with many critics because of incongruous sidesteps through snapshot montages. It's not a comedy either, with multiple scenes tragic and haunting. The film is wildly uneven, and yet holds together by the thinnest of creative threads. William Goldman's screenplay - which won an Academy Award - has a touch of European vogue and frankly, had this movie been made in France involving 19th century Parisian outlaws, critics would have embraced it as an international classic.  But it's not European, taking place within the magnificent American vistas of Colorado and Utah, where trains chug steam, hooves forge dust and rough men carry gleaming pistols. Okay, it's kind of a western, but one of the most eccentric ever made. What saves &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34; is the transcendent presence of two icons in the title roles - Paul Newman, at the peak of unparalleled popularity, and Robert Redford, young, angry and on the verge of superstardom. Their natural give and take, as likable as ever seen, created an outrageously appealing chemistry which audiences across the world loved. It molded the blueprint for the &#34;Buddy Movie&#34; seen to this day ([[ASIN:B000HWXEUY Lethal Weapon [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B0018PH3L0 Lonesome Dove]], [[ASIN:B00177YA1K Men in Black]]).  Director George Roy Hill, like this film, has also been something of an enigma. He's never been considered more than a good director and yet, this work, his Oscar-winning [[ASIN:0783225873 The Sting]], [[ASIN:0783230508 Slap Shot]], [[ASIN:B000085OY1 A Little Romance]] and even his swan song [[ASIN:0790740044 Funny Farm]], have legions of fans who quote every line. I don't know if time will be kind to Hill's erratic career, but he was a good craftsman who took the reins of &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34; without the slightest intention of making a western. He did however, have an interest in creating characters, perhaps the key to his unique canvases.  The film is slightly based on the true story of Butch and Sundance, two of the final outlaws to roam the shrinking west and the inspiration for the first film in history [[ASIN:B0000WN1JA Great Train Robbery - 100th Anniversay]] (1903) produced by none other than Thomas Edison. At the turn of the century they discover their way of life is closing fast, ultimately pursued by a Dream Team posse (based on fact) that forces them to flee to South America. They are accompanied on their exotic journey by the mysterious Etta Place, a strikingly beautiful woman known to historians only by a photograph, whose fate to this day is unknown. Well played by the equally lovely Katharine Ross (one of the great professionals of a golden era), she serves as Butch and Sundance's guardian angel, housing them after brushes with the law, in love with both, eventually choosing to leave when it becomes apparent their lives will end in violence.  A Bohemian trio, they make for one of the most picturesque teams in film history adorned in fine clothes while sipping champagne and dancing to period music. The already-mentioned montages serve as bookmarks to tilting chapters of the film, including the famous sequence of Newman and Ross on the bicycle while the great Oscar-winning tune &#34;Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head&#34; plays. Additional montages detail their trip to South America and their renewed criminal interest in Bolivia. The music of Burt Bacharach ([[ASIN:B000023X81 Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid - O.S.T.]]) has received much criticism over the years. An enormously talented composer equal parts avant-garde and pop, his score is about as far removed from Dimitri Tiomkin ([[ASIN:B000001PBC Western Film World of Dimitri Tiomkin]]) as can possibly be.  The soundtrack works because once again, Hill's not making a western, but a character studyof anachronistic free spirits trapped by modern civilization. The film needs the urban edge, if only to detail in 1969 free-spirited rebels taking on an American system. &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34; may detail western outlaws, but in Hill's heartbreaking and hilarious daydream, they are gregarious hippies on the most fantastic road trip in history. That Newman, Redford and Ross evolved into grounded celebrities, shunning the limelight for liberally productive lives, further adds to the appeal of this most novel of American blockbusters. It has such unusual whimsy, almost never equaled.
0061120073|5.0|It's the summer of 1912 and Francie Nolan of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, is eleven years ago. She and her parents and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, are a poor family and they know it. Her beloved Irish father, Johnny, is a part-time singing waiter and a nearly full-time alcoholic. Her petite, black-eyed Austrian mother, Katie, is the janitor (\\"janitress\\" here) for three tenement buildings, in return for their rent on a small flat. But with all this, they get by, though it's nearly always a struggle. Everybody likes the dapper Johnny, who seems incapable of doing anything right. Everybody respects the steel-cored Katie, who is equally incapable of making a misstep. This entire book could have been written about either of them and the reader probably would be just as satisfied. But Francie is the focus: Intelligent, thoughtful, observant, imaginative, dogged, tough -- she's all those things. She's also lonely and pretty much friendless. The narrative follows her through the next six years as she grows up physically, mentally, and emotionally, changing from a ragged street kid who collects junk to sell for pennies into a mature, confident young woman of seventeen who has skipped high school and yet is going off to college, having passed the regents' exams on the strength of summer courses, and without the benefit of high school. Francie is one of those kids who understands things. The book isn't exactly a novel, in the sense that there's no overarching plotline and nothing much of importance happens. It's difficult to answer the standard inquiry: \\"What's it about?\\" It's more of an oil painting in words, a portrait of the Brooklyn of a century ago and the people who lived there and who, with all their tribulations, still thought it the most wonderful city in the world. The style is very plain and straightforward, yet quietly poetic (which is partly why it's always included on school reading lists), but Smith spins her story out in such a way that you can't wait to find out what happens next to her characters. What holds everything together are the book's universal themes of family, interdependence, determination, and the power of learning, as well as a profound realism regarding both the good things in life and the bad. Betty Smith herself grew up largely as Francie did -- she originally wrote the book as a memoir but was convinced by her editor to recast it as a bildungsroman -- and she went on to do memorable things in literature. The reader will have no doubt that Francie (who no doubt has added \\"bildungsroman\\" to her vocabulary by the end of the book) is headed for a similar future. This book and the people in it -- and Brooklyn -- will stay with you for a long time.to find out what happens next to her characters.

0891419063|5.0|Should be required reading for every American.  Sledge's story seams surreal in today's politically correct nonsense environment, but today's American cultural needs to understand that protecting America's freedoms sometimes requires violent action on the part of it's military.
B004132I20|5.0|This is an excellent version and update of a classic literary character. I have watched it several times now and still enjoy it each time. The acting is excellent and the writing quite good. I was wishing for more and can't wait for the next season to start. There isn't much in the way of extras, but it's great to see the original pilot in comparison to the final Study in Pink. I would have liked more behind the scenes and interviews. Well worth the money and more than well worth the time.
0756656230|5.0|This book was an excellent buy. Well written, informative and was a very big hit with my  step-son. Highly recommend this one to anyone interested in Legos and their history.
B002ZG99N6|2.0|Ben Affleck can act.<br /><br />Whether he can direct or not remains to be seen.<br /><br />The Town shows some good signs and some glaring holes.<br /><br />What he does well are the action scenes.  He also selected a really good premise, gritty, tough Irish neighborhood where band robbery is a cottage industry.  In any movie this is half the battle.<br /><br />Where he sucks is in character development and capturing the ambience of this Boston neighborhood.<br /><br />The female lead, that tall rangy actress whose name I always fail to remember is two dimensional and we have no idea why she would walk out and her job as a bank manager and start hanging out in what looks like a community garden with a bunch of munchkins.  What in the hell is she doing there anyway?  Ben's character is a little too noble as are his friends, who at the end of the day are bank robbers who kill people without a second thought.  There is also some slutty blond that hangs around inferring the child she has in tow is Ben's.  What in the hell is that about?  Don't any of these characters have a back story that is worth more than two sentences?<br /><br />The neighborhood comes off as too pretty and as a great place to live when he should strive to show the random violence, hopelessness and grinding poverty of the place.<br /><br />However, like I said, the action scenes are first rate but unfortunately are not enough to sustain the movie.<br /><br />Better luck next time Ben.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I have been waiting for this last installement of the 'fever' series to come out with so much 'fevered'anticipation that I was counting down the days until it's release. I got it and read it in a day and a half. I couldn't help feeling as I was reading it that there was not enough 'OOMPH' to it. I was waiting for the sexual tension to build like it did with all the other books and was left feeling let down. Don't get me wrong there was still a lot of story line that opened up a lot of doors to who is who and who did what, but I was left with a feeling that this book could have been a lot more. Still left with a lot of questions that I think should have been answered. Obviously the author is going to write another series about some of these characters which might answer the questions, but I think if this is the series finale with Mac and Barrons a lot more should have been done with tying up the loose ends. I gave it a 3 on a scale of 5 because it wasn't as good as the other books in the series. I think my biggest disappointment in this last book is that this whole time Mac and Barrons has this fierce, sexual relationship where he takes what he wants and it's usually very physical and erotic. I was waiting for the time when Barrons finally realizes that he loves Mac and that instead of the 'rough' sex, I wanted him make love to Mac. But the book ended and no such show of love came about. That's the fizzle for me.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is one of Angelina Jolie's best films; everbody in this film plays thier roles exceptionally well. The plot is very well crafted and the action stupendous, although somewhat unbelievable. The portent of the film changes somewhat during its course, making the film even more attractive; this is definately worth viewing twice.

B003Y5UP44|1.0|I loved the book! Passionate, Spiritual, Composure, and a gruff sort of real love. This movie was a very poor adaptation of the book! First of all, the girl who played Jane was timid and too young looking. My husband called her fragile and feared for her throughout the movie. Nothing like the book, where she is strong hearted and willed. She also looks about 14 and sticks her lips out like she wears braces... very distracting. The guy who plays Mr. Roschester only did slightly better. His acting was more spot on, but he obviously felt very little for his opposite and there were no sparks whatsoever. In fact the way they played off of each other it was just as much a surprise to my husband (who hasn't read the book) as it was to Miss Fairfax that they fell in love. Which brings me to Miss Fairfax, who was the only character worth watching. She fully became Mrs. Fairfax with her kindness and discretion. In fact her portrayal made me realize new things about her in the book that I hadn't noticed before. I don't want to blame it all on the actors... The screen writing/ directing was heartless and quick too. It sped through things with little emotion. I hope to find a better version.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Wow. This movie is probably the best Batman movie I have ever seen or will see in terms of story. The last scene was very...I can't even put it in words. I never thought that a Batman movie would make me feel like that but that is the power that the story possesses. This is definitely a very mature movie considering what Batman has to deal with. You MUST see this movie, whether you're a fan of Batman or not. I grew up watching Batman and he always had some gadget to deal with situation before him but nothing like this movie. I will probably remember this movie when I'm 80 years old, if I live that long. I have seen Batman beat the Joker and others plenty of times but don't really remember much of it. TRULY EPIC!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Ok, I've been using this for a week, I've only done level one but I am feeling a difference. I weigh 185 so I'm pretty overweight. I've never been able to stick with exercising before, after about 2 or 3 days I would just not have time or not feel like it. The video is only 25 minutes so there is no excuse. Jillian is pretty upbeat which is motivating. She says 400lb people can do this so you can too, which if you've seen The Biggest loser, you know is the truth and it motivates you to do it.     I'm feeling stronger already. Even if you are sore the next day,like i was, get up and do it! Go slower if you have to, But do it! It'll keep you in the daily routine. Within a few days it becomes easier.
0689859414|4.0|I loved this book. The information is interesting and meticulously researched. But the thing I really like about this book are the pictures. They are full colour and are beautifully drawn.
B0015DROBO|4.0|this book starts a little slow but ends great and leads you to book number two which is even better.
B0040JHNZ2|5.0|Ok - first of all - I have not yet finished reading the book.    But I do not want it to end!!! :(    I love the characters in the book and how Follett wrap them into each other's lives across borders, war, classes, peace and love. How he lets them interact with real historical people and tell about the time before, during and after the First World War in a way that enlightens you without seeming like a history book.  It's almost so I can smell the streets of Aberowen and hear Fitzherbert's upper-class English. I felt I was part of the Bolshevik revolution and marched in the streets of Petrograd. I demonstrated for women's right to vote and enjoyed dinner with the Duchess. From the dark Welsh mines, to the speakers of London Parliament. From the French muddy trenches, to the White House and fancy cars in Buffalo. From the poor rural areas of Russia to champagne in Berlin, to the dirty East End of London and on to the mafia in the U.S.. Follett is a master storyteller. I follow him everywhere.  The pages just fly away, but in a pleasant way that makes you excited without feeling breathless. This is not the book you read in bed hoping to sleep. This is the book you gladely stay up all night two finish, although you do not want it to end ..  The Pillars of the Earth captured me from the very beginning, and World Without End was a superb continuation.  Once again Follett has created a masterpiece.  I see that this trilogy has already caught me before I've finished reading the first book.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|I stayed with the book until about halfway through.  I just couldn't get through the endless and repetitive narrative.  Franzen seems to find it necessary to tell us what he considers to be each important fact or feature at least ten different ways and I just could not muddle through any further.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|the blu ray version of this resident evil is beautifull.. the most unknowen fact about the 4th resident evil movie<br />is that the production was allowed to use (JAMES CAMERONS AVITAR CAMERAS).. Yes those revolutionary 3-D hi def<br />cameras. the colors pop and the action is clean and impressive. The resident evil franchise is going strong with at least<br />2 more installments planned. so i am very happy i added this to my collection. great special features and a stunner of an ending make this a great gift for that guy/gal that loves sci-fi or zombie movies.

B000I0QL82|3.0|Watchable, but it looks like they spent too much money on this before the war. It had USA propaganda in parts, and really wasn't realistic. The best thing this has for it is some of the dancing by Astaire and singing by Crosby. The storyline left something to be desired.
B0002DB0FO|3.0|Okay. I'm rating this as a product that is being sold, not the television show. I have zero qualms with the show. I love the character development, the plot, the scenery, and the writing. What annoys me to no end is how the DVD case is put together. The case has 3 plastic \\"pages\\" that bend as if you were flipping through the book, with one disc on each side, totaling 6 discs. The problem is that these \\"pages\\" of heavy plastic are only attached by a single strip is super cheap glue. After flipping through them once, they all fell out of the case and the overall presentation is ruined as a result.     Of course, this has nothing to do with the playability of the TV show, but it is something that is just put together very cheaply. I would have paid another 5 bucks or so to have a stronger case, because I'd prefer to not have it fall apart the next time I go to watch it.

B003IEJZUG|3.0|The somewhat unlikely storyline is very well crafted and I found it engaging for most of the way through, although my suspension of disbelief was severely challenged when he shared his life raft with a Tiger called Richard. What spoiled it for me was the way in which the story was brought to a close, it seemed disjointed and almost rushed.    I realise in saying this, I'm probably in the minority as so many people have loved this book.
0061191981|3.0|I love Gordon Ramsay to death and watch all of his shows on Fox and BBC America.  He may be one of the top chefs in the world, but when it comes to writing, he is no Anthony Bourdain.  Ramsay tells his story in a no-holds-bar fashion, almost as if he was having a beer with the reader in a pub.  The tone is very conversational, but the tales he tells could have benefitted from some ghost writing.  I enjoyed the stories, but was hoping his writing would be as exquisite as his cooking.

B002ZG97EC|4.0|Forget about producing and directing films with real people...let's make cartoons! I mean really...I'm not saying it's easy, but take Despicable Me for example. You take a guy (Chris Renaud) that worked in production on some relatively successful animated releases over the past couple of years and team him with a guy (Pierre Coffin) that's worked in production on some pretty unknown animated releases, get Steve Carell to be your lead voice, and voil&agrave;! You make half a billion bucks (to date) with your first go-around in the director's chair for a full length animated feature. Sheesh. Did I ever go into the wrong business!<br /><br />The story is old as the hills but it works yet again. Show a bad guy the value of family and love and maybe his heart will grow to appreciate all that is good and what he's been missing in the world. The Grinch, Scrooge, Darth Vader and now...Gru.<br /><br />Steve Carell is Gru and Gru is a supervillain that will not be outdone by up and comer supervillain Vector. So Gru tricks three orphan girls into helping him with a diabolical plan. Sounds evil, right? Nah. G-rated stuff (oh, that is unless you ask the MPAA who gave the movie a PG. PG? Really!?! The MPAA these days will make Winnie the Pooh look like Freddie Kruger if you give them enough time). No, there is no need to fear, parents; the only evil in Despicable Me is that it made a half a billion dollars and I wasn't involved in the making of the movie.<br /><br />Despicable Me is really funny, heartwarming and great for the whole family. Add it to your cart; it will be watched over and over again by the kids (until Despicable Me 2 comes out in 2013).
030746363X|5.0|I've read a lot about dieting and body conditioning. By now, this is the more effective book I've found about this matter. It's easy to understand, all is well documented, and most important for me: it works. It is a straight-to-action book, but if you take the time to check the references, the science behind the chapters, wow, this is a full compendium of state-of-the-art knowledge and practical applications for body hacking.  The first chapters, and the indications on how to use the book are really helpful, and a very clear brief about motivation. The Q&A chapters are a clever way to guide the reader, and the \\"science sidebars\\" are an example on how complex things must be explained to be understood.  If you want (or need) to change your body, and/or your mind (mens sana in corpore sano) this is THE book. It helps you, it challenges you, it can complete you.  Than you, Tim.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Three out of Four rates four our of five..........Alien, Aliens, and Alien Resurrection are still cliff-hanger outstanding science fiction movies made even better by BluRay.  The sound on my system got a little \\"chunky,\\" with not distinct high sounds in a true surround format, but still good enough to provide what amounted to an even-better-than-original-release -in-a-theater experience.  It might have been sub-conscious prejudice, but the best movies in order are still:  Alien, Aliens, Alien Resurrection, and that third thing.

0439023513|5.0|Katniss Everdeen has done the unthinkable. She's survived the Hunger Games not once, but twice. And, as before, she's in even more danger now than she was when she entered the arena. President Snow holds her responsible for the unrest that continues to grow in the Districts. Not only that, he's apparently made it his personal vendetta to break her. Now, no one is safe, not her District, her friends, and most definitely not those she loves most.<br /><br />As she navigates an increasingly deadly, heartbreaking terrain, Katniss will struggle against internal and external forces that threaten to defeat her.<br /><br />I'm caught between counting myself lucky that I started this series when it was complete, and missing out on all the conversations and speculation and discussion that occurred while everyone was waiting for this last installment. I think I missed out a little bit, but I can't deny that I was extremely grateful that I could, after the shocking end of Catching Fire, immediately pick up the final book in the trilogy.<br /><br />And just as with the previous installments, it pulled me further into Katniss's world and made me even more invested in these characters I've come to love.<br /><br />I have to say that I finished this book breathless, broken and drained. It squeezed every last bit of emotion out of me throughout the course of it, and did not let up until the very end.<br /><br />If you think that, after reading the first two books in the trilogy, this mostly a story about love set against the backdrop of a rebellion, I'd disagree. I think this is more a story about a rebellion and war and the people that fight them with a bit of love and romance thrown over the top of it.<br /><br />We're thrust into District Thirteen with Katniss where she realizes that evil doesn't always reside only on the other side of the line. Where being a pawn is sometimes the only choice you have until there's another one. Katniss continues to deal with an increasing amount of stress from her experiences in the Games, and it shows in her actions.<br /><br />Part of the reason that this hit me so hard was because of the utterly heartbreaking truth of what had, and was continuing to, happen to Katniss, Finnick, Peeta, Gale and all the others that I'd been on this journey with.<br /><br />It's not an easy story.

031603438X|5.0|I have always liked the rolling stones' old music (up to about 1978) and I thought I had to read this book even though I thought Keith Richards was putting on an act most of the time. So I didn't think the book would be that good.  What I really like about it is that he sounds like you're listening to one of your mates ( the guy next door) and this makes the whole thing much better.  A story told by Kieth Richards (a real person). After reading this I have a great respect for the man that I didn't have before.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is a great addition to my running gear.  It is very accurate compared to the Nike+.  The advantages are: accuracy, ease of use, lightweight.  Disadvantages: trouble syncing the HR monitor, I tend to touch the bezel by mistake and change the view.  Luckily they have planned for this and you cannot stop your workout by accident by brushing the bezel.  Overall, I would recommend this watch.

0385341679|5.0|\\"Shadowfever\\" picks up where \\"Dreamfever\\" left off. The book is large- somewhere between 600-700 pages (I have it on Kindle, so that's a guesstimate), but it's just one of those books you CAN NOT put down. You literally don't have the ability to walk away from it. Suspicions are confirmed, but blown away at the same time- it's beyond what you'd think. I'm trying very hard not to give ANYTHNG away. Just give in to the fever and buy this book. You won't be sorry!!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This movie is a great testiment of good Disney movies. This movie has a good moral, lots of great music, and lovable characters. The movie is great for kids, but be warned that some of the \\"Voo-doo\\" parts can be scary for children under 5 or older if your kids are unfamiliar with it. There are parts that have scary shadow figures coming to get one of the main characters and that can be frightening. Thankfully I watched it before my kids and knew that would cause nightmares. I would suggest either fast forwarding through these parts, or explaining them to your children BEFORE you watch the movie.    I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and so did my young kids. As someone who has not been to New Orleans, I appreciated the accurate scenery, the taste of the music and festivals, and even the back swamp area. I would highly recommend this for adults and children alike.
B004856SQ8|4.0|The `A-Team' film is a very different beast to the TV series, but it is no less entertaining.<br /><br />This is a film that you need to suspend disbelief for to fully enjoy as it has the most ridiculous and outlandish plots, scenes and stunts that you could quite easily ruin this for yourself by being too incredulous.  Most of the action in this film is pure fantasy, but the explosions, stunts, one liners and execution more than makes up for this.<br /><br />Following the gulf war the A-Team have to recover some stolen money minting plates and clear their name after they are framed for a murder and the original theft of said plates.  You see how they track down their enemy and how they are double crossed and betrayed by those they have had to trust.  Pretty much your standard action film fare.<br /><br />Liam Neeson has the most ridiculous accent going, but if you can not let this annoy you too much you should be ok.  Bradley Cooper is a credible Face and manages to be reminiscent of the TV series character whilst bringing his own style to the role.  This also applies to Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson who plays BA Baracus.  The gold jewellery is missing, but the same attitude is there.  My favourite has to be Murdoch who manages to come out with some hilarious lines and stops the film from taking itself too seriously.  His impression of Mel Gibson in Braveheart had me howling!<br /><br />This film also offers plenty of their trademark DIY adaptations and gadgets, as well as a brief appearance from the black and red GMC.<br /><br />This is a perfectly enjoyable action film and as long as you don't compare it to the original TV series, or take the stunts or credibility of the action too seriously, you can enjoy this for it's duration.  It's a good, but not great film, but still worth a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0385341679|5.0|I adored the Fever series.  I loved DreamFever, I loved how dark Mac got, I loved that she turned Prya and Barrons had to help her back, I loved that through out it all you knew Mac was good... but that she had a darkness inside that the dark side kept exploiting, trying to pull her out all the way.  I was not disappointed in FaeFever or in any of the books where it seemed there was no more light.  So many times authors will cop out.  So many times they will give the heroine huge amazing powers that can never be daunted.  They give the hero fights where he gets bloody but you never worry for his life.  I loved how hard Mac had to fight for every single tiny inch.  How hard the world had to fight to regain the ground.<br /><br />Now about Shadowfever.  I would recommend re-reading the last four books.  There are a lot of tiny small things that are important that are forgotten without re-reading the series... that's why it took me two extra days to review, I'm really glad I did though because it made Mac's journey that much more real, the sorrow that much more tangible.  Mac ended the last book thinking that the Beast had died so Barrons had died, thinking that there was no way to get back to her own plane of existence, and to the world that is ever falling in darkness. The greatest part of this book was the cameo appearances of the MacKelters, I started reading Moning when she was a highlander romance writer and adored the added magic she would throw in to the plots. When I read Christan's entrance in the Fever series I was giddy wanting to know more about that family. In Shadowfever we see most if not all of them and their families, it was like a beautiful mini reunion for me.  For those of you who haven't read her highland series I'm sure it was a little eye rolling and wondering why all these new characters were introduced.<br /><br />The most fantastic part of this book though is the expansion of the Fever world.  With this book though Moning answered many questions, she also set up future plots, stories and couples.  There will be more books in the Fever world and I can sincerely say I would love them if they were dark like Mac's or light like the Highlander series, either way I'm there snuggy (don't judge) wrapped around me and book gripped tight. Enjoy.et up future plots, stories and couples.

B00447G2MK|4.0|I bought this album on a recommendation of a friend. It is a pretty good album. I like it. It doesn't blow me away by any means. But they have a catchy, melodic and semi-hard rock sound. Most of the songs are good. They remind me of a little harder edged \\"Yellowcard\\", minus the violin. I listen to a lot of hard rock music daily and for some reason, songs from this album often get stuck in my head.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Pros:    7.1, 5.1 Dolby simulated surround sound    Bass Boost- can increase the lows in-game    Chat Boost- headset automatically alters audio during explosions so chat audio is still heard    Wireless    Removable Microphone    Cons:    Wireless Digital Frequency is way too populated           Pops, hisses when multiple wireless devices are active in your home    Batteries are loose- headset may shut off with a sudden movement    Chat too loud or too low- a result of the chat boost option    Not comfortable    Setup requires items not included in order to have 7.1 audio active    Quality does not match price tag      OK, overall I liked the headset, at first. It is a MAJOR improvement over normal stereo headsets. I had the X31's prior to getting the X41's and the difference was huge.In Black Ops, you can tell almost exactly where enemies were in a 360 degree setting. Footsteps were amplified and you can approximate enemy fire in terms of distance. The added boost sounded nice especially when I played music through the dashboard over the game audio. You can also remove the mic if you didn't want to chat or were playing a game like Splinter Cell.    However, I had some issues with the device. The chat volume was too sensitive, it either was too loud or too soft, which might be a result of the chat boost mechanic. If you want the advertised 7.1 surround sound you need the optical audio attachment sold separately, or else you won't be able to use your hdmi cable. When I had my computer on and connected to the internet, the headset would pop and hiss; based on each game it was either better or worse. The ear cups are circular; I have big ears, so this felt terrible after an hour. To compound this negative effect, if I reached up to the right side of the headset to shift it, 7/10 times the set would shut off because the batteries were set pretty loose. Just recently, the headset began popping at an increasing rate until it completely shut off over and over.     I eventually returned my headset because the popping in my eardrums was starting to be painful. I understand my headset may be defective which would slightly excuse the popping, but the setup, battery component, chat, and wireless frequency make this headset inferior. I paid $170 and all it made me want to do is pay $200+ for a headset I can rely on. If you can't shell out 200 dollars for a headset, then give this a whirl. Just don't expect greatness personified into a headset.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I have been an Accept fan since 1982. But I kind of lost interest in the band years ago when I heard their original singer, Udo Dirkschneider left the band. I was browsing for new music when I came upon this CD in the rack at Best Buy. I bought this album on a whim to see how their new singer sounded compared to Udo Dirkscnieder. And man! I am sure glad I did. In my opinion, this is the best Accept album they have ever released and one of, if not the best metal album I listened to from 2010.  Just about every song is 5 stars and kicks ass! Their new singer is a great replacement for UDO. He doesn't sound like UDO very much. But that doesn't matter, The guitar riffs and lead solos are so damn good, the singer is secondary. But he is very good in his own right.     If you like Accept or metal music, I HIGHLY reccomend you get this album. You'll definitely be happy you did.
0385341679|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down.  My only complaint was that Mac could have learned her lesson a little quicker and been more willing to make her feelings known.  But it's a minor complaint to a great end of a series which I am so sad is over. Can't wait to read other novels from Karin Moning. Her imagination is beautiful.
0307454541|4.0|i read this book shortly before the author's death. His death made me very sad that an unbievably talented author was gone. This book is a taunt, suspensful and an edge-of-your-seat thriller. It has great twists and turns.If you love mystery thrillers, you will love it.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Wow...just...WOW! This book was an astounding conclusion to an amazing series. I don't think I could ever recommend this book enough! Every page is charged with high emotion. Incredible highs and devastating lows. More twists and turns than any rollercoaster! Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, you turn the page and get cast through another view-changing portal. By the end, you are truly questioning all of your perceptions. A book that won't get out of head for hours after you've put it down. No classic heroine here. No classic hero either. Nothing is black or white, it's all shades of grey. What a ride! What a rush! If this book doesn't have you sitting on the edge of your seat and forgetting to breathe...well, you may want to question your humanity, lol. Thank you Amazon for having the digital download exactly on time, don't think I could have wanted one second longer.

078322611X|5.0|I kept renting this movie whenever I needed a feel-good/baseball/Costner fix, and finally decided it best to own it!  When the voices come out of nowhere, shivers run up my back and, at times, I can't help but tear up at how Costner deals with his life and those around him.  The all-star cast of Costner, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta and Burt Lancaster really do it for me.  A GREAT movie!
B004EQAVHI|3.0|Never let me go is an odd science fiction film is that it is set in the past instead of the future (strictly speaking, it is set in an alternative universe, but in the fiction the action takes place from a somewhat different 1970s to the 1990s and the clothes and the technologies suggest the action takes place a few decades ago). At the start of the movie, it looks like we have stumble into one of those quaint and boring films set in a traditional English school. But soon more fantastic undertones occur: as the story goes, we are told (this is not a spoiler since it is explained a few minutes into the picture) that these particular children at this school have been destined, without their consent, to give up their organs when they reach adulthood. Without any apparent family (whether they were cloned or how they were born is never told), they have been bred by the government to give their organs several times, so that their untimely death is inevitable. The movie soon centers on three of the children/young adults, two girls and a boy, who know what their ultimate destiny is and try to avoid it (having two beautiful actresses like Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley play the two young women certainly helps the movie). What is never explained here is why they (or other young people in similar situation) don't escape. They don't like their fate, but they seem more resigned to it than they should. Especially, since the movie never shows the country to be a heavily militarized society in which escape to another country would be highly improbable. And in any case if you know your inevitable destiny is untimely and painful death as is it clear here, you would try to get away from this place anyway even if the odds are slim.  The movie has many interesting and suggestive themes, but unfortunately it is never able to blend these themes into a very good movie, just an interesting one. And it bothers me a bit that organ´s transplants which has saved so many people's lives in the real world, here are made to look so sinister.
0385341679|5.0|Karen Marie Moning is one of my favorite authors, so I was waiting with bated breath for \\"Shadowfever\\" to release.  I was lucky enough to go to New Orleans for the book launch this week, so I received the book late Monday afternoon.  I stayed up the whole night to finish it, and it was worth every bit of lost sleep.    If you haven't read the series, I fully recommend that you start with \\"Darkfever\\" and then read it sequentially, the feelings won't be as strong if you haven't read the first four, and you will have too many questions if you read this first.      I don't want to give away any major spoilers, but I have to say this was the perfect end to the Mackayla Lane Chronicles.  If you have read the others and you are hoping there will be a pat answer for every single question you have over the course of the series (like I thought I wanted), you may be a little disappointed.  You aren't going to get an exact name for what Barrons is, but I have to say that by the end of it I didn't care if I couldnt' say, \\"He's this.\\"  And frankly, it hasn't driven me crazy one bit--there is plenty of description of Barrons to give you enough answers, personally.  Half of the questions I thought I needed answers to, I just didn't.      We all know Karen is a master of suspense, if you've read the other four Mackayla Lane books you know that she is the Mistress of Cliffhangers...but don't worry, you aren't going to get a gigantic cliffhanger that will drive you nuts for another 18 months like we had between \\"Dreamfever\\" and \\"Shadowfever\\" I was ecstatic with the end of this book.    The best part though, is that we do get some new questions.  I know, I know!  MORE questions?  New ones?!  That will drive me crazy!  And it will eventually drive me crazy I'm sure, but I was so happy with the end of this book that I can't even care about the new questions and the new possibilities that are presented with this book.  I am a member on the message boards on Karen's website, and so I knowa fair bit about the theories that have been thrown around about who, what, where, and all of that about every single character...but some of the events and the answers to the \\"who\\" and \\"what\\" surprised even me.  There were some things that I just didn't see coming.  But the new questions allow us to look at the possibilities for the NEXT series (and as I was at the Q&A session on Tuesday I can tell you there WILL be more books in the Fever world, just not with Mac and Barrons at the center).      ***SPOILER*** My biggest concern was that I wouldn't get a happily ever after--I'm so used to it from Karen's Highlander books, that I would have been devastated without it, frankly.  And while I thought I knew exactly what I wanted out of my happily ever after (one just like the Highlanders), I got one that was even better and even more perfect for these characters.  I don't think I'm giving too much away, Karen said before that we would get a \\"fulfilling HEA,\\" but she was so right.  It couldn't not have been more perfect for the characters, and I even had to stop and think, \\"Yeah, she so got this,\\" while I was reading because I felt like a tool for even questioning her.     ***SPOILER ended***    If you loved the Fever series, you'll love this.  I don't understand the 3* that have been given, but it seemed that it came from those who already thought the series was too long.  I am so happy that the series is finished and that I got my answers to those questions and frustrations that I felt regarding the relationships in the books, but I would have continued to follow these books for another 5 books frankly.  I don't think anything from Karen can be \\"too long\\" personally.  I would read 1000 pages per book.      If you love Karen's books, if you have enjoyed the Fever series, then you'll love this.  I can't get enough of Karen's books, and can't wait for the next books that she has--even if it might be 18 months down the road.  :)
B00006LIRI|5.0|This cd is definitely an excellent and definative collection of U2 hits. All the songs are gems and each one has a style of their own. I am lucky to have been a teenager when many of these hits were created. For example,Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me is a unique electronica influenced song that came out around 1995 for the Batman Forever movie. I do believe that I was 14 when I first heard this fun song. The ending to \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me is very provocative, but it only adds to the brilliance of the song. Then there is the very upbeat and energetic \\"Discotheque\\" (the video to this song is very good as well). Other songs in this collection that one may find themselves replaying are: \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"Staring at the Sun\\",\\"One', \\"Numb\\", and \\"Stuck In a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\". \\"Beautiful Day\\" is a very therapeutic and feel good musical track to listen to for activating your joy levels and as a positive reminder to enjoy life regardless of what happens externally. I personally liked \\"Discotheque\\" and \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" the most because these two creative masterpieces are musical tracks where U2 dared to push the musical envelope the most (with beautiful and creative results). This cd is going to be fun and exciting to listen to if you like any of the U2 songs and/or you enjoy listening to 90's rock/alternative rock.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This is an amazing gps + heart rate monitor. If you're interested you cant hear the bad reviews, forget it. The all functions work better than any other watch. The softwares to use it is so easy in my opinion and the option to see all the training in the google earth map is a superb experience. When you transfere the files to the computer you will see all detailed information about your training in one screen. 3 weeks using and enjoying it so much.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am still just starting out with this workout, about 2 weeks in, and I have been enjoying it. I definitely feel the benefits and hope to start seeing them if I keep it up! I love that it is a short workout as I am a working mother and don't have an hour or two a day to dedicate to working out. Trying to shed this extra baby weight!! I like there are different levels. Feels like you get more for your money. I like Jillian a lot too. She is very motivating. I would recommend this to people who may not have a lot of time but want a workout that includes cardio with toning.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I was skeptical about reading this, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. Portia de Rossi is open and blunt about her struggles with an eating disorder. She doesn't sugar- coat it, and truly lets the reader feel what she was going through each time she tried to justify her disease.
B0042816YK|1.0|I'm a big fan of Julia Roberts and James Franco and am truly surprised that either of them would attach themselves to this schlock. The main character Liz is a self absorbed bitch. I kept thinking it has to get better. The ending is going to be great. But as predictable as any chick flick, she falls for \\"the guy\\" like that's the only salvation available. So much for finding yourself. It's an awful movie. And as it seems that's a common opinion. I only wish I would have asked more people before I wasted the 2+ hours.
B0032JTV74|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, so technically it's not mine, but I do get to enjoy it just the same. Glee was a surprise to both my wife and I when it aired on Fox. We really didn't intend to watch it, but caught the pilot on a slow TV night and were hooked. The plots can be a little harsh or obvious, but the young performers are great and its like getting to see a small broadway musical with each show. The real advantage to the Bluray DVD set is that the picture and the sound are so much better then broadcast TV (even though that is pretty good these days). I have kept up with the Bluray technology and both our DVD player and receiver are only about 6 months old and have the latest audio and video decoders. I think that is why we get the full benefit of what the Bluray DVD set can deliver. So if you also have the equipment to see/hear it in its true potential I think you'll love it too.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|While I am a big fan of the series I'm afraid the copy I received was packaged nothing like it is shown or described on Amazon.<br /><br />Instead of a nice collectors box with the discs in individual keep cases with art and episode listings on the back of each case and a series booklet that fits into the box I received a copy that consisted of all four discs crammed into a single flimsy slim-case.<br /><br />Of course this meant that I didn't get the collectors box, the individual cases with art and episode guides or the booklet.<br /><br />I must say I was very disappointed, while the content is what I want I feel very strongly that I have been sold a pig in a poke.<br /><br />Some may like the savings of shelf space that a slim-case may provide, I however would much have rather have had the product that was advertised when I ordered.<br /><br />In fact I ordered a copy about two years ago for my brother for Christmas and the nice box set is what I received then.<br /><br />If the products packaging has changed then I think showing the older and far nicer packaging is both misleading and likely to cause anger and resentment.<br /><br />I do recommend the series, which is wonderful and well worth your time. Just be aware that what you are likely to get is not what is currently advertised by Amazon as of the date of this review.
B00417HV14|5.0|For those who are reading this review but are unfamiliar with Joe Bonamassa, he is a young blues guitar prodigy from upstate NY. I am a long time follower of the blues, from seeing James Cotton as a teenager and I love both the traditional U.S. delta blues and the blues rock that came from the British affection for those same delta blues. I give this background, because I discovered Bonamassa through an Amazon recommendation for similar artists to many of my other purchases. I bought 3 of his albums (in CD form, I still love the hardcopy media), just based on the MP3 files I could listen to online. They are all good, but the live album, \\"Live from Nowhere in Particular\\" just blew me away. It's a 2 disc set that I listened to almost daily for weeks after I received it. Both the soulfulness and pure virtuosity of Joe's performances are breathtaking. My brother is a blues guitar player who has played with some of the best. He only knew of Bonamassa as the \\"next great thing\\", but had heard that before and never heard Bonamassa perform. When I played the live album he was so impressed he did some research and we discovered he was a child prodigy and grew up 90 minutes from where I live.     So with all that background, when I saw a blu-ray of Bonamassa at the Royal Albert hall, I pre-ordered it without hesitation. I am lucky to have the latest blu-ray DVD player and receiver technology, so when the album arrived I set it up and sat back with high expectations. It didn't disappoint. From the opening when you get to hear him talk about this being his life's dream, to play the Royal Albert Hall like Clapton (and making it at the tender age of 32) to seeing and hearing from his family, you feel that you are getting to know the artist as a person. Then the fun begins. He is surrounded my a group of formidable musicians (the good ones are always a magnate for talent) and every track is worth listening to. The recorded sound quality is excellent, and I see an average of a dozenmajor live performances a year (I've been a Bethel Woods member for several years), so I know the difference between live sound and the digitally mastered (and fudged) crap we listen to on most newer albums.    I won't do the play by play of every track as some reviews do. But if you have the equipment to get the full effect of what's on this disc, you can put this one on and pretend you're there, and I think you'll be transported.
0345444051|2.0|Although this book is brilliantly written, and its author thinks radically outside the box, there is such a strong vibe of hopelessness running through its pages that I label it, and its author, disturbed.

078322933X|5.0|This movie features Mark Walberg, aka Marky Mark, and Reese Witherspoon. Young Reese meets the guy of her dreams. Little did she know everything isn't always what they seem. So her and Mark, become boyfriend/girlfriend. And if i'm not mistaken, end up having sex.. (I haven't seen it in a while so I might be mistaken this part of Fear with Mother May I Sleep With Danger (always a movie worth watching).) Anyway, then Reese notices something wrong with Mark. So she dumps him, like in all movies like this. Despicably, he becomes obessed with Reese, (which by the way works very well with Mark, hot, sexy Mark obessed). Anyways, then he trys to kill her and her family.. You know, the usual.  But if I had to rate this 1 to 100, it'd definatly be a 100.  So by any chance, check out this movie. You can buy it on Amazon.com either new or used, although new costs more, to me Marky Mark is sooooooooooooo worth it.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I recently payed 9.99 to own a digital play it now copy of Shutter Island. Though the movie was amazing in itself the quality of video I got from the On Demand feature was far from perfect. And of course Amazon doesn't allow returns or refunds for digital downloads. When trying to find out what I could do I was relayed to the trouble shooting area of the website telling me to check my internet connection and so forth. I know my internet was just fine in fact the Play it Now player stated I had a \\"high\\" quality connection while viewing the film. But to my dismay the video would freeze and the sound was more than a sentence off from where it should have been creating confusion as to who was saying what. I feel cheated and may never use this option again. I advise using caution when contemplating a download. Spend the extra couple of dollars buying a hard copy!

B00171LFFK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000002KAT Astral Weeks]] Astral Weeks is a seminal recording of the the 60's. Van Morrison was the former lead singer of an Irish band called Them which, with a history in the blues, gave no clue that a recording like this was coming. He had a huge hit as a solo artist with \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" which again gave no clue that something like this was coming. This was Van's first recording for Warner Brothers and it's jazz twinged bass lines and drummer-less fluid musical lines showed an affection for beatnik era coffeehouse poetry and flowing saxophone tinged musical lines.<br /><br />Rock critics of the day always list it in their top ten of all time recordings. I agree and love everything that Van has done to this day, but he never--with the exception of his album \\"Veedon Fleece\\" ever approached these musical and lyrical heights again. Every music collection needs at least one copy of this album. Preferably you'll buy more than one as you will want to share this music with someone who also loves good music.

I certainly will be more discriminate before I purchase another one of your cd's. What a waste.

Blind fans say they are as good, but they are not. It simply does not work that way. An artist may have 356 songs for an album. He will put the 10, 11, 12 he (and the producers, band mates, whoever) thinks are the best ones. Simple as that.<br /><br />The DVDs are very good also. I liked the doccumentary the most.<br /><br />The notebook wal also a great selling point. Very clever idea.<br /><br />Let's wait for THE RIVER anniversary edition...
B000003TA4|3.0|This is one of the most important albums in recent time, much has been said about how it changed the music world and can never be changed back, and other great pathos. Well, that is true to an extent, before 'Nirvana' and the rise of alternative rock, music was considerably more cheesy (or romantic) and was less willing to explore darker more disillusioned themes. They also opened up a whole new chapter in popular music because so many alternative rock bands who's style of music was not popular before this were now able to get mass exposure.     But I mean, what, with all these guys with hair down to their knees, bragging about everyone they could get laid with and how cool their sunglasses and cars are, if some little guy comes along going 'I'm so crap, I don't deserve to be alive', well, he seems refreshing, like a much needed change of pace.     As for the music itself, it is enjoyable. Nirvana have a disaffected atittude, and blend dissonant and major key melodies with a powerful, rocking delivery. This is also where the band perfected the soft verse heavy chorus technique.     So the opening song, 'Smells like teen spirit' is a powerful rock song with that unforgettable riff. This song has a slight 'sinister' atmosphere to it. The other big hit off this was 'Come as you are', an acoustic song that had a good chorus effect. These were the only two Nirvana songs I'd heard before I bought the album. When I heard the rest of the album I was surprised at how 70's the rest of the songs sounded, which I wasn't expecting. Also, these were the only two songs that used guitar effects (other than distortion). For example 'Breed' was an energetic rocker that almost feels like classic rock, and 'In Bloom' is a melodious song that also has a bit of classic rock feeling and slightly country sounding. The raved up 'Territorial pissings' is possibly the most pure punk song that the band ever did, at least it is on this album. Most of the tracks rock pretty hard and have plentyof energy, except the acoustic 'Polly' and the haunting ballad 'Something in the way', which has good vocal harmonies and a cello!    On the weaknesses of this album, well, Kurt Cobain's slurred lyrics are supposed to be a breakthrough, but I would disagree. It's like saying praising a guitarist for not being able to play guitar or a drummer for not being able to play the drums. Sometimes you don't really understand what is being said, particularly on 'Drain You' and 'Lounge Act'. Also, some of the songs are a bit repetitive, and wear thin on repeated listens.     Anyway, it's an a good listen, interesting, and, as you know, highly influential. ***
B0001I55SS|5.0|Walt Disney making a DARK movie about science back in the day is hilarious but kind of fun.  I would say you can classify it as a sci fi horror.  I loved it when I was 7 years old and I loved it again today.  Get under the influence of something and enjoy the story maybe with a girlfriend or a few friends.  There are a few cute robot scenes that girls will probably dig. The science is exaggerated but interestingly amusing.
B004B8DH98|5.0|The italian town is just bonus, and what a bonus it is. Beautiful acting, wonderful cinematography, and interesting execution of a typical story. I'd like to thank all the people who gave this movie a bad review for being the reason that studios make movies like Transformers and GI Joe.
B0000AFX64|4.0|The whole concept and storyline of this Battlestar Galactica Movie is amazing.  Overall it is worth a few good laughs with some of the corny technology and the silly dialogue. At some points it drags on a little longer than what I wanted but I was still satisfied.  If you have nothing to do and want some silly inspiration to maybe write your own SciFi movie then give this movie its due.  The actors are worth it too.  You will know who they are and have a chuckle or two when you realize they got their big start on this film.  hahah
B00280LYHS|1.0|By Peyton Mower<br />Random book with lots of things from out of the blue. Like when Hades came out to fight for Olympus as they were about to lose. I was disapointed by the way Rick Riordan ended his series. I suggest you dont read this book
0786868724|5.0|I met Mitch Albom at a book signing at a little out of the way book shop in Edwardsville Illinois when his book, For One More Day, had just been released. He talked a bit and then signed. The book shop closed this past year, but he had come there for his first signing of Tuesdays With Morrie, when hardly anyone showed up at first, but the room filled, welcoming him warmly, and Mitch kept returning in spite of his handlers not feeling he needed to visit the little stores any longer. He signed my copies of Tuesdays With Morrie, The First Five People You Meet in Heaven, and For One More Day.<br /><br />Each of those books had taken me in and were hard to put down to go back to the daily life swirling around me needing my attention. As with those three, Have a Little Faith, was the same way. I took it to a doctor's appointment having only read the first chapter, after a long wait in the waiting room and appointment room, and an even longer wait for the scheduling of a surgery, I made it over half way through the book and balked each time I had to be interrupted. The next day, I read several more chapters while waiting at the hospital on pre-testing and meeting with various departments regarding said surgery, again reluctant to be interrupted. One of the doctors, after our meeting, asked how I was enjoying the book. He had read the other books I mentioned but not yet picked this one up. I told him it was a fine book and probably my favorite next to Tuesdays With Morrie.<br /><br />In the book, Albom's rabbi Al Lewis, from his youth and young adulthood asks him to do his eulogy, eight years before his death. Albom decided he must meet with him and get to know the man again. In the meantime, he forms a charity that brings him in contact with a pastor, Henry Covington, who intrigues him. The book is interwoven bits with the rabbi, scenes from Albom's youth, tales of Henry's ugly past and clerical present, as well as bits of the rabbi's sermons. Each piece connects the next in the best way possible for a read that is not wanting for anything.<br /><br />As I believe from his writing that Albom did his own examination of his faith and beliefs during that eight year period, so I did of my own during my reading. Though the Jewish Faith and Christianity stand side by side in this book, neither religion is proselytized, but the subject of Faith runs throughout both.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is a true story that will warm the coldest heart.possible for a read that is not wanting for anything.

Goodbye Suzan Collins, I hate Mockingjay.

B00280LYIC|2.0|Lightning Theif was not as good as my freinds made it out to be and it disapointed me. It was OK with OK imagination but I dont think I will read  the next book.
B003F3FJQO|2.0|I honestly do not like this book. Granted, I haven't finished yet, I'm only about 85% through it, but UGH.    I have to start out by saying that I loved The Maze Runner. I loved everything about it, except for the ending. Like, really, he goes through the changing and suddenly has all the answers? That's anti-climatic and just plain boring.     But I held out hope for The Scorch Trials and was completely dissapointed. I'm bored. I'm not having fun while reading it. My heart didn't race, I don't care about any of the new characters, and the great old characters are gone for so much of the book. Minho and Newt and Chuck were neccesary in The Maze Runner to distract from the violence and intensity of the book. With them missing, The Scorch Trials isn't doing too well.    And what's with all this passing out? I mean, literally every two chapters Thomas is passed out or asleep again. It gets to the point where it's just a plot device to keep the story going. And it is limping along.    On a similair note, I hate authors that use dream sequences. It's childish and boring. Dreams can be very vivid and life-like, especially after trauma, but they're so ANNOYING. And everyone excuses it by saying that it's Thomas getting his memory back but that's not an excuse. It's a crutch.     Onto the plot \\"twists\\". YAWN. Oh Theresa turned on Thomas WHAT A SHOCKER. I don't even know how that situation is going to end but I don't care. Yes, there was a connection between the two in The Maze Runner, but Brenda is so much better. And this is just another plot device. How many times has there been an almost-couple that are taken away from each other and one turns on the other but it's ok they'll end up together! Or one will die. Instead of the originality of The Maze Runner we get a formulaic, boring story. I wish this book was better. I'm dissapointed and resentful. I'll probably read the next book but I don't have high hopes.     The Scorch Trials were not worth reading and this just proves my theory right; dystopian novels should not have sequels.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I was watching Ellen's TV show on the day that Portia came for an interview about her book \\"Unbearable Lightness\\", I was intrigued, by the end of the show, I was saying to myself, I want to read this book. You go through life never really hearing of the actor/actresses who have any kind of disorder or disease, and the battles they go through. To hear her talk with Ellen, she sounded so sincere and sad and I don't know, I just felt that, it was something that I wanted to read. Which shocked me because I am one who reads Vampire related Novels all the time.<br /><br />I've read reviews where people are saying that she didn't talk about her life as she was growing up, but I don't think that the story, the life of her disease starts when she was growing up, I believe the story comes from when she started acting, and when she knew she was gay, and she had to hide it from everyone, because of society and the judgmental individuals.  I believe that her disease comes from the stress of trying to be perfect for everyone around her and for a role on a tv show, that she thought they wanted someone who in this case was 'thinner' or a 'better body build'. And although there are those of us who are not actors/actresses, we too feel the same sometimes.<br /><br />When I was reading this book there were times where I was angry at Portia because she was sounding ugly, when she was talking about the people around her being 'fat'. My feelings were hurt, because I am a full figured woman, and to read someone say these things, it hurt my feelings. The ugliness comes from the disease, and once I realized this, I thought WOW, it really does take over everything.<br /><br />I think that whether you want to read this book for yourself, or because you know someone, or even if you just want to read it just because, I think that its a good Novel to read. In some ways, I think that reading her story gave me strength and a different mindset to the way I sometimes feel about myself.  Which is, No I don't have a perfect body, and no it doesn't always make me happy, but sometimes having the perfect body, doesn't mean that a person has the perfect mindset. Happiness comes from within, and a person has to do what makes themselves happy.<br /><br />Overall, I think that Portia did a great job on this Novel. I have no regrets for reading it. I would recommend to others, as a matter of fact I already have.<br /><br />Thanks Portia, for having the strength to overcome and battle the disease, and showing your readers that everyone is human and that with love and support from those around us, anyone can succeed.!I don't have a perfect body, and no it doesn't always make me happy, but sometimes having the perfect body, doesn't mean that a person has the perfect mindset.

B0015DYIH2|2.0|The only Twilight book that I have actually bught was New Moon due to Jacob being such a prominent part of it. I feel tha Breaking Dawn was a letdown it kind of clumped stuff together and did not make sense sometimes.  *Spoilers ahead*   The begginging was ok up until Bella begs to Edward blah blah(you knowwhat i mean) then they cant stop for the rest of the trip?? WHAT?? Disturbing much? Then whe she finds out that she has a  baby she calls rosalie? Wouldnt you rather have called your mom, but mommy cant protect you from vampires.  The Jacob point of view was nice because it allowed variety into the story. Later Edward askes Jake something that I thought was not appropriet(sorry i dont know how to spell that word) it is even frowned upon by normal society. That beng said the last scene in Jake's mind was very gruesome and not cool (I hope they stop the movies at Eclipse) then Jake imprints on Bella's DAUGHTER??? Definatly not cool...  Back to Bella's point of view... she skips being a newborn? Call me crazy but that seamed like a great plot line to follow but if she did not skip crazy vampire mode then Bella would not be able to see Charlie ever again. I had expected the big fight with the Voultori and was kind of disapointed...you never see the vampires in fight mode. Also the fact that Edward would not help Bella train to fight seemed kind of stupid. I mean come ON she's immortal duh... Altogether I felt the book could have been a lot more positive and Bella could have been a stronger person both mentally and physicaly in making decisions. I Prefered(also do not knowhow to spell that word either sorry) Stephinie Meyer's other book The Host much more.  Lots of love and read better books( or check this out fvrom the Library) &#62;^.^&#60;
0786715103|4.0|I don't quite know what to make of Lt. General Dallaire's harrowing 1 year experience in Rwanda as the Force Commander of the UN Assistance mission.  On the one hand, he managed to save thousands of lives by protecting civilians who would have otherwise been slaughtered at the hands of the blood thirsty, machete wielding, RGF sympathizing local mob.  On the other hand, having been denied on numerous occasions the necessary troops, armor and equipment, Mr. Dallaire appeared to be nothing more than a pawn in the UN Security Council's pathetic attempts at portraying a false image that Rwanda mattered.  The Rwandan genocide was allowed to occur because of the \\"fundamental indifference of the world community to the plight of 7 to 8 million black Africans in a tiny country that had no strategic or resource value to any world power.  An overpopulated little country that turned in on itself and destroyed its own people...\\" p. 6    Over 800,000 lives perished in a matter of 100 days, 300,00 of whom were kids.  Millions were displaced.  Mr. Dallaire was duped into thinking his attempts at bringing peace would pay dividends.  He and his UN team of a skimpy international force saved some human lives, \\"but which in the scheme of the killing seamed nearly insignificant.\\" p. 414    Mr. Dallaire served in Rwanda for a year out of a sense of moral obligation, near the conclusion of which he became a casualty and was forced to abandon his mission prematurely.  He saw death, destruction, mutilation and shook hands with the devil, and thankfully survived all of this along with post traumatic stress disorder to tell the story of \\"The failure of humanity in Rwanda\\", and telling it he did magnificently.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I have patiently waited for this book. I read it in one sitting and found myself so irritated with this book that I was muttering to myself at it's ridiculousness. I feel that she could've summed everything up and made it a lot more interesting in fewer books. I also didnt like the fact that Mac and Barrons didn't even really admit to feelings for one another until the end of the book. I was so tired of her being so wishy washy. I also didnt like how I was jerked around- was she the unseelie king, or not, unseelie king or not. I mean, come on!!! There is a difference between twists and turns to just plain stupidity. I also have read how people say that she grew up from the first books. Really??? She still was just as stupid as ever. I was so tired of reading that she didn't know anything. I think that this series started out well and by the third, KMM was just trying to get as much money out of these books as she could. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!
B003EY7IRC|4.0|I read Dreamfever when it was first published and so have had to wait a long time for Shadowfever. In fact, the wait was so long that I reread the first books to make sure I had all the details straight before starting this one. Since I pre-ordered in April 2010 and expected the book in December, I was a little tense when I found it had been delayed until mid-January. Between the wait and the hype, I was expecting great things.    And, while I have enjoyed the series, like others, I was let down at the end. So as not to spoil the series for anyone, I'll point out that while characters need to change and grow, the essence of this series was the tension between Mac and Jericho. When that tension ended, they both became much less interesting characters.    I agree with the folks who are wondering about Christian. I was wrapped up in the Highlander series first, and leaving him in the process of becoming ... what? ... seemed a bit contrived as the opening for the next series. I have to say that I hope Christian does not get together with Dani. I've never liked Dani's character and was not surprised to find out her role in the story.    And for everyone wondering what to read while waiting for KMM's next novel (2013?) I'd suggest Julian May's Pliocene saga, which starts with \\"The Many-Colored Land.\\"

0316098337|5.0|I read 35 books on my Kindle last year and this was my favorite one. Simple and clear, yet thrilling and profound, Room is narrated by a five-year-old boy, whose whole existence is limited to his mother, a TV set, and an absurdly small garden shed, This is his story, and what a story it is! Don't hesitate, don't read any more about it, don't pay any attention to negative reviewers...just buy the book and READ it. Trust me.
B0042816YK|1.0|Let me start out by saying that I did read the book before seeing the movie, and well...that was no easy task. Once I got passed the part where Liz is in Italy, I had to force myself to get through the remaining two-thirds of the book. I never saw the movie in theaters, because I knew I wanted to finish the book before watching the film, but it took me several months to finally get through the book. Once I finished my reading, I was verrrry disappointed and was hoping that the film, which had just come out on DVD/BluRay, would bring this woman's story to life and prove much less painful to sit through as it was to read.     Often, books are made into films that really shouldn't be. Generally, people tend to prefer the book over the movie, but at least the film is \\"pretty good\\" and watchable. Not the case with Eat, Pray, Love! I think the main issue is that it isn't another great fiction novel about love, or wizards, or vampires. Basically, the book reads like a diary or journal. This isn't a \\"story\\" or a \\"tale\\" it is simply the author, Elizabeth Gilbert's, account of everything that happened to her during this period of her life. So there is honestly no beginning, middle, and end. There is no climax, not even a plot. This kind of writing can slide in the literary world (referred to as non-fiction or autobiography) but it's very difficult to translate non-fiction to the big screen unless it's a documentary, like March of the Penguins or something.     I don't know what I was expecting from the film... I guess I thought maybe the filmmakers would add in a plot to make it more interesting. Honestly, the movie probably wouldn't have been too bad if it were simply BASED on the book, not translated verbatim. But no, the movie was filmed the way the book was written, minus all the narrative that made the book at least sometimes amusing or intriguing. It is IMPOSSIBLE to sympathize with the character in the film... basically it just appears that Liz is suddenly very unhappyin her marriage for some reason, and instead of discussing it with her husband like an adult or putting forth any effort at all to save the marriage, she bolts. BAM! DIVORCE! Makes you want to grab her by the face and say \\"look you dumb bitch, this isn't some casual boyfriend who you don't really like anymore, so you just break it off and move on. He is your HUSBAND!\\" What kind of a message is this woman sending out? That if you are even the slightest bit unhappy in your marriage, you don't address the problem, you just file for divorce and run away to a different country??     So the film starts out with the main character, Liz, pulling a very selfish move (and practically out of nowhere since the movie lacks the narrative that the book includes to provide a bit of explanation and reason for her actions..), making her rather unlikeable and unable to relate to. A main character that the audience hates... not a good way to start off a motion picture. The part in Italy was at least visually appealing (and appetizing..), however, kind of randomly pieced together like a collage, including various shots of tourist spots, food, Italian people, and Julia Roberts doing the \\"Julia Roberts laugh.\\" I recall the scene where she claims to have gained all this weight and is struggling (to the point of having to lie on the floor) to put on a pair of jeans, even though there is no visual evidence of this supposed \\"weight gain.\\" It's like when a 110 lb woman is complaining about her love handles... you just kind of want to slap her.     I was watching the movie with a friend who hadn't even read the book, so I couldn't even imagine how torturous this movie-watching experience was for her. Once it got to the VERY sudden flip flop over to Bali, my friend and I just couldn't take it anymore and fast-fowarded to the rather anti-climactic love scene with Javier Bardem. I remembered seeing him in the previews and wondered which character he was going to portray in the film, but was surprised to see him playing a character who, in the book, was supposed to be much older than Liz. I'm pretty certain that Javier Bardem is younger than, or at least the same age as Julia Roberts, but whatever. Soon after this scene, they run away together and the movie concludes with them riding a boat off into the distance or something cliche like that.     Bottom line: This movie has no plot, the main character is irritating and impossible to relate to, and the last two-thirds of the movie (and the book) are extremely difficult to get through without burying your face into a pillow and screaming. The only delightful part of the film is Richard Jenkins' portrayal of the character Richard from Texas, but sadly his appearance in the film ends very abruptly and the movie starts to suck again. And the brief period in which she dates David, played by james Franco, seems pointless, unnecessary and almost kind of irrelevant to the rest of the film. Unless you're in the mood to watch a crappy movie and make fun of it with a friend or loved one, I suggest not wasting your time or money on this one.

However, going into my third week, I have already noticed muscles becoming more defined in my legs and arms. I am also noticing my endurance increasing and while the workouts are tough, they are do-able. I find myself looking forward to doing them (even though I am yelling at Jillian during them sometimes). To prevent burn-out, I have been going back and forth between workouts 1 and 2. I am saving 3 for a couple more weeks or until I feel like I am getting bored. Overall, amazing workout - and it goes by so fast!
030746363X|1.0|Alright, I must admit that I loved the 4HWW, actually I have read it three times, a great read with so much valuable information. This new release is a joke, I would say that maybe 1/4 (if that)of this book has useable, real world information, the rest is just entertainment and snake oil. Tim has made a fortune off this book through his eccentric and off the wall marketing. Tim is laughing all the way to the bank. Myself, and the rest of you just got suckered.

I thought the phone romance was sweet, and the fact that he had to abduct her to save her life (while putting it at risk) was also sweet, and crazy!  It was a nice and crazy high risk romance, just like the ones she was always reading anyways!  I half expected the ending to be her \\"book\\", lol.  But the movie was top notch,primo actors all around, nice storyline, lots of exploxions and a decent storylines.  You can't go wrong with Willis or Freeman!  Definitly pick it up if you haven't already, worth the watch!

0385342047|1.0|I want to preface this review by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in the \\"Shopaholic\\" series. I skimmed \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" and \\"Shopaholic and Baby.\\" I fully expected to read \\"Mini Shopaholic\\" straight through but found I just could not suspend my disbelief long enough. The novel reads like a Mad Lib (come up with your own adjectives for Becky and what she buys) and the main plot line is weaker than Becky's resolve when it comes to shopping. Really, an entire novel about someone planning a surprise party?!    I am also appalled (but sadly, not surprised) by Becky's immaturity and dishonesty. Even more appalling is the fact that she faces no consequences for that dishonesty. She is actually COMMENDED for it! I am so tired -- no, completely fed up with -- the \\"deus ex machina\\" in EVERY SINGLE Shopaholic novel. It's time for Becky to grow up and solve her own problems which, by the way, are of her own making.
B0041G683W|5.0|This new concert version raised the stakes from the 10th Anniversary concert.  The difference on this one is that it's semi-staged.  Actors come on and off stage, so they are not just sitting there.  It adds to the excitement of the concert.  This version also contains the changes made for the 25th Anniversary production.  Slight orchestration changes and libretto changes as well as constumes and set changes (including the Victor Hugo paintings).  The performances are all strong and fantastic except for Nick Jonas.  He lacks the strong passionate voice that makes the character of Marius.    The filming and sound of this production is fantastic.  The 1080p really makes this a brilliantly visual concert film.  I highly recommend picking this BluRay disc up!  FYI: it was commented that this was a cheaper disc when purchased through amazon.co.uk.  This is true.  With shipping the price is about $21 as opposed to the $56 price tag on the import or the $28 price on the forthcoming US release.  Be advised, it will take about 3 weeks to receive...but it's worth it!

After hearing them perform \\"Down by the Water\\" at Bumbershoot in Seattle last summer, I knew this album had the potential to be good, but I never imagined it would be this great!  I've been a huge fan of the Decemberists since \\"Her Majesty\\" came out in 2003, but this album was like hearing them for the first time again.  After one listen, I was immediately reminded of R.E.M. (no surprise since Peter Buck played a major role in making the album) as well as a hint of Neil Young's \\"Harvest Moon.\\"  Apart from these influences, the album still maintains a sound that can only be described as distinctly and uniquely Decemberists.  So, if you've ever loved the Decemberists, I have no doubt that you'll enjoy this latest addition to their already incredible catalogue.
B004IM14RY|3.0|So, yeah, Ryan Reynolds can act.  Great job!  But the movie itself is so full of gimmicks and full of set ups just for the sake of making something happen. This story could have been told in a matter of 15 to 30 minutes, but instead was forced into an hour and a half.  The plot felt forced, the bad guys were simply stereotypical, middle eastern bad guys and, oh my god, how many times will no one answer the goddamned phone?  I'm still trying to figure out if the writer of this film is angry about getting the run around on the phone or if he is angry about the war in Iraq.  The premise is interesting but, really, did it have to be an hour and a half?  Did the guy really have to cut of his finger and how many set ups for lighting do we really need?  I am impressed, however, by Ryan Reynold's performance.  If it weren't for him I most likely would not have watched this movie.  Great job casting director!  But all in all, the movie felt too gimmicky and the ending wasn't at all surprising.
B00192IV9U|4.0|Item was delivered quickly.  I gave it as a gift so I don't know how good the songs were.
B002ZG9788|2.0|This Movie should have been so much better!!! It seemed to me that whoever paid to make this movie ran out of money and rushed what should have been a 3hrs movie into one that was over just as fast as it started.. The lead actor wasnt that great and did the movie a terrible injustice.. I was so looking forward to this movie only to be let down every step of the way.
B000FC1192|4.0|We started with this book for a light reading club. It is really cute and I can see kids enjoying it. Just be careful, a younger one could be scared by it. The Kindle version was very cute, with images in tact.
B003L20IJM|5.0|Emma does it again!  We loved the first McPhee film, but this one is our favorite of the two.  We hope Ms. Thompson will consider bringing us another chapter in the life of Nanny McPhee, soon.  (Amazon, as always, delivered the purchase on time and in perfect condition. Thank you!)
B00275EGWY|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worse war movies ever made.  Having served for 37 years as a Soldier and Army Civlian, I saw numerous inaccuracies.  Other reviewers have pointed them out.  The basic plot jumped from one scene to the next with no sense at all.  Big example, at the end when the two main stars are riding in the Humvee in Iraq; then the next scene, SSG James is pushing a grocery cart in a supermarket. Did they go back home?  They kept showing on the screen that the Unit had X number of days left in their rotation.  They should have had some kinda of departure ceremony one would think, but nothing.  The Director needs to let her ex do the movies!  A much better war movie from years ago is \\"Go Tell the Spartans\\".  Now there is an excellent war movie (Vietnam).
B000F1IQNM|5.0|My family loves this movie.  The entire cast in this film and in the sequel deserve standing O's for their performances.  Ms. Thompson has wonderful insight into the inner child.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Two brothers in Massachusetts are boxers, and one is given one last shot at a title fight. The older brother is a former fighter, but is now crack addicted. He trains his younger brother, but is unreliable and hurts his prospects. Excellent acting here by all involved elevates this above a standard boxing drama. The dynamics of a close knit Boston family being torn apart are present, as he becomes close to a local woman, and seeks to embrace outside help in his career. This is a strong dramatic effort with no surprises, but solidly done.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Yes, I really mean that. I am really too lazy to review most books and even though I've read tons of great series and books, my problem is I read the entire series in a week and by then I don't really want to review the individual books.   With that said, I came into this book with an \\"We'll see\\" attitude. I was probably one of a minority that was kind of wondering when the payoff was going to happen. It has been a long and winding road!  And that is a great thing! It's much more than a typical romance or paranormal urban fantasy, and amen to that! I will applaud the author tremendously, *SPOILER*, no way to proceed forth here and not spoil, so you have your fair warning: some of the scenes with Barrons /shiver! They are some of the best love scenes I've read, some of the best tantalizing teasers of what is to come and sexual tension in a series I've ever read and it was fantastic.    I'm suggesting this to all of my friends.   This was a fantastic finish. Moning really drags us through hell and back for a well earned salvation ;).
B002ZG9800|5.0|A con man who is gay goes to prison and falls in love with another inmate. He is a slippery character, managing to escape from prison many times, all for the sake of the man that he loves. This is a very clever and funny film that will keep the viewer entertained throughout. It is also unpredictable, and will have you guessing what will happen next.
B00004T9VY|4.0|I loved Cat Stevens when I was a teenager in the 1970's, and hearing his music again today, it really stands the test of time.  What more can be said?  Oh yeah---the artwork is cool as well.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|A young ballerina is selected as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, replacing an aging star that was forcibly retired. She must deal with a difficult director, an overbearing mother, and the jealousies of her fellow dancers. She is being terrorized by one of the other dancers, and has to deal with psychotic episodes. The film succeeds at thrusting the viewer into the world of a woman who is achieving her dream, which turns out to be more of a nightmare. The strange psychotic episodes that she endures blur the line between fantasy and reality for not only her, but the audience. This film is a very strong effort that will capture the audience.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|I was so used to playing games on my friends xbox, where the triggers were so crucial for games, such as first person shooters and I was going to buy these for my controllers for my ps3, but then I played Call of Duty: Black Ops on my ps3, and the R2 and L2 triggers are only used for grenades.  I don't see myself need thes Dual Triggers for grenades.  It basically comes down to your preferences.  You can adjust the controlls so you use the R2 and L2 triggers to shoot, but I find that just pressing the R1 button is much more effective, especially since I prefer semi-automatic or 3-round burst weapons over the automatic ones.  Pressing a button is much easier than a trigger, at least for me, since I am much better at Black Ops on a ps3 than an xbox.  It basically comes down to your preferences, and if you would rather use a trigger than a simple back button, then get these, but if you are like me, the controller is fine as is.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The  Duke of York must try to overcome a speech impediment so that he can inspire the people of England while speaking publicly. After many failed attempts, he meets a speech therapist that may just be able to help him. With strong performances all around, the movie is a treat for those who enjoy superior acting. Moments of humor sprinkled throughout this dramatic film lighten the mood for the audience, and the chemistry between the leads is extraordinary. One of the year's finest films.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Richard Harris is wonderful. He makes you feel everything he feels. It is a really good story about someone who loves his wife and friend so much and then it all gets torn apart. Fabulous and sad!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film is a look at the progression of the financial crisis from how it all started, concluding with a look at where we are today. The problems began with a push at deregulation during the Reagan administration, leading to Congressional legislation passed in 1999 which allowed banks to venture into the lucrative world of derivatives. The incestuous relationship between the banking industry and the federal government allowed this crisis to develop and result in no criminal convictions as a result of the misdeeds that were committed.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|We received the Beatles:  Revolver disc in the mail just in time for Christmas (it was a stocking stuffer).  Sounds awesome.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|It's a great idea but like with so many computerized devices, the software is greatly lacking.  The hardware they appear to have done very nicely.  Operating System updates break this device and Logitech isn't very good at releasing good, new drivers for it.  Really, I should give it a 1-star rating but the (useless) hardware is nice enough to barely assign it 2 stars.  It makes a gorgeous paper weight with a \\"technology\\" theme to it.
0385341679|5.0|I have been a devoted KMM fan or a long time.  It was very hard dealing with the cliffhangers and the pain the characters went through.  However, those ended up being the things that made it more enjoyable.  Cliffhangers provided much speculation and interaction with people about their ideas.  The pain the characters went through mirrored some that I had felt myself.  The books became a journey for many people, full of ups and downs, but always with the promise of a happy ever after.  It was everything I wanted it to be and more.  Thanks Karen Marie Moning for writing a wonderful story that has impacted my life in a good way!
B002QEXT4W|5.0|Procol Harum changed over time from being mainly a classical theme band on Whiter Shade of Pale to hard rock with a classical background. This album catches them after that transition. Like all of their other albums, this is one I wouldn't mind being stuck on a desert island with!
055380684X|5.0|I agree with the Tom Peters quote on the cover of Daniel Coyle's The Talent Code, \\". . . you will not read a more important and useful book . . . .\\"<br /><br />Coyle's book led me to read Colvin's Talent is Overrated, Dweck's Mindset, Shenk's The Genius in All of Us, Howe's Genius Explained, Gladwell's Outliers, and many other sources on the topic of acquiring talent including K. Anders Ericsson's seminal research.  I became so absorbed that I read books and articles on this topic when I was told I should be doing other things.<br /><br />Whatever I read, I always came back to reading Coyle.  He's a wonderful researcher and writer.  He wrote a wonderful, inspiring, optimistic book.  Highest recommendation.<br /><br />Robert Beattie<br />New York Times bestselling author
B0049OSQ18|5.0|When Colin Maloy was interviewed last month, he indicated that The Decemberists had reached the \\"zenith of excess\\" in \\"The Hazards of Love,\\"  and the new album would have a simpler sound and approach. This announcement surely made many wonder what this would mean for a group who seemed decidedly dedicated to producing wonderfully arcane and intricate music.  For those who were afraid that the \\"The King Is Dead\\" would sound like something from the Ramones, there is nothing to fear.  Although this album is not as conceptual, complicated, or complex as \\"The Crane Wife\\" or \\"The Hazards of Love,\\" it still challenged and satisfied this listener, both musically and contextually.  (By the way, the notion of The Decemberists covering Ramones songs does have a devilish appeal.)    If the CD cover did not say The Decemberists on the cover, the music would still be clearly recognizable.  How could it not be with Mr. Maloy's distinctive voice at the top of his game and with the rest of the lads and lasses on their trusty instruments?  With Peter Buck visiting on guitar, there are indeed some songs that have pleasing gentle murmurs of R.E.M.  For instance, \\"Calamity\\" would fit nicely into R.E.M.'s \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" and \\"Down By The Water\\" is reminiscent of \\"The One I Love\\" from \\"Document.\\"  There is also a more noticeable dash of country than before accomplished with slide guitar, harmonica, and violin. But the music is still primarily The Decemberists' unique style of folk toned down just a bit.    All ten songs are pleasurable listening, but this review will focus only on two, the thematically linked poems for the seasons: \\"January Hymn\\" and \\"June Hymn.\\"  Both of these songs are beautifully crafted, with the narrator in January experiencing the wintertime safely either in the cozy indoors or wrapped in warm clothing, and wondering where both the winter and his love will go.      As all seasons turn, the cold winter becomes a summer's day in \\"June Hymn.\\"  The pastoral lyrics fill this song with colors, flowers, and vines, and are complimented by this special chorus:    The yellow bonnets  Garland on the lawns  And you are walking  And the day was breaking  A panoply song  And summer comes to Springville Hill    Through the imagery of this song, it feels, smells, and sounds as if the listener is taking an early morning walk along the hill.      \\"The Queen Is Dead,\\" and has been for a while. Her musical passing was much enjoyed. \\"The King Is Dead\\" now too, but will not soon be forgotten. So long live . . . The Decemberists.
034537410X|5.0|I have always been interested in the topic of lucid dreaming but I have never really dug into it before; this book is my first attempt.  It is enjoyable and educating, but I have not produced a lucid dream though I am half way through the book.  That is probably not the books fault but I am a little dissapointed.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|I have all three twilight blu rays.  The story plot and how the actors portray their characters are wonderful.  I love the way the Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart emotions of their characters are very convincing.  They both do a wonderful job.  I can't tell you how many times I have watched these movies.  All are just great!!! I can't wait to see Breaking Dawn......I know that this movie will be great, too.
B002ZG9968|4.0|For synopsis see above.    I am a big Alex O'Loughlin fan.  Loved him in the TV show Three Rivers and currently in Hawaii 5-0 and so I enjoyed him in this movie.  Not so sure I like his character throughout the movie but as a romantic comedy fan it all worked out in the end.  And, I was so relieved he had no body tatoos as he does in Hawaii 5-0. J Lo is good and the supporting cast is fantastic. Be sure to watch the credits for outtakes.  And to hear Alex speak in his native tongue watch the special feature of the making of the movie where he is interviewed. If you like Alex O'Louglin you'll enjoy the movie.
0380715430|2.0|This book has too many errors at every turn to be taken seriously.  It is as scholarly as an article in a weekly magazine.  Not reccommended.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|The worst album yet.  There were a couple okay songs on this album and the rest sucked.  It is composed of mostly sappy country love songs.  The bland vocals lack the appeal and intrigue of their other albums and the songwriting and composition seem rushed and unoriginal.  Overall the songs are boring and uninspiring and the album is not worth the money.  If you liked the previous albums don't ruin your interest by purchasing this cd.
030726999X|4.0|It was a good book but think the first two books were better. But, I guess had to read the third one to finish the story. I felt like the author did not have the same momentum in the story he had  in the first two books.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|The movie is good, but it's highly overrated. Probably because social networks and facebook are on the media a lot, but it certainly doesn't deserve all the buzz.
0765326353|4.0|A thousand-page long first book of a ten book series?  I have to admit, it worried me.  Had Sanderson let his job of finishing Robert Jordan's work influence his writing?  Was he trying to out-do Jordan in the Guiness Record of most Word Count?  I am no wimp when it comes to reading long books or long series', but I have to admit that I quit The Wheel of Time after book 5 or 6 (I was finding the characters less and less interesting and sympathetic and was tired of nothing happening over hundreds and hundreds of pages).<br /><br />Sanderson is always an interesting world-builder, however.  He set his Mistborn series in a world of darkness and ash-falls.  This one also takes place on a rather extreme environment:  an ice age is approaching, threatening most of the population of their kingdoms.  There are also flora and fauna to go with this world that also is subject to storms that are not survivable by man if he's caught in the open.  And of course, this is all going on in the background.<br /><br />In the middle ground are the kingdoms of Roshar--particularly Alethkar, with its competing noble houses and warlike way of life.  And the stratification of society into an upper class of light-eyed people who rule over the dark-eyed.  And hints of very different ways of life in other kingdoms that will not doubt be explored a bit more later in the series.  And there is the history of the Knights Radiant who used to defend mankind and who betrayed it (maybe), and the more recent mystery surrounding the death of Alethkar's king--who was assassinated for an unknown reason by the strange Parshmen, whom the kingdom subsequently engaged in a years-long war.  And there are the Shardblades and armor worn and wielded by the nobility--which gives them increased strength and protection.<br /><br />And in the forefront are the characters-- Kaladin, a fierce fighter and natural leader who is betrayed and sold into slavery.  There is Shallan, a girl who seeks a place as a scholar, looking to see if history can solve the problems of the present, but who is also driven by conflicting desires that lead towards unforgivable betrayal.  And the lord Dalinar, uncle to the king, who finds that following traditions conflicts with his hope of saving the kingdom and his nephew.<br /><br />Kaladin's story is compelling enough to get through 1,000 pages easily.  And the other characters and their situations are just interesting enough to keep things going happily between Kaladin's sections.  And that feat alone deserves high accolades.  Of course there are all kinds of other bits and pieces... such as the spren (spirits? essences?) that inhabit things, but aren't self-aware aside from Kaladin's unusual spren.  And there's the bizarre landscape of the Shattered Plains where armies battle on a landscape literally fractured with deep crevices where huge and deadly creatures roam bearing gems treasured by both armies.<br /><br />I have to think that Sanderson might just pull such a long series off...  I'm definitely interested in reading the next book, at any rate.ory can solve the problems of the present, but who is also driven by conflicting desires that lead towards unforgivable betrayal.

B002ZG974M|5.0|My six year old daughter absolutely loves this movie.  The scenes and pictures are beautiful as is the music.  We watched it for free on OnDemand several times and eventually purchased a copy for her for Christmas.  The adults in the house love it too!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|As for sharpening, it gets the job done.  There are 3 parts to it: a carbide sharpener, a ceramic sharpener, and a serrated edge sharpener.  The black part of the tool is made of cheap plastic, but it feels like it will hold up for it's job.  It's good for small to medium knives but I wouldn't attempt to use this on large knives or machetes as it's compact size could easily slip from your grasp.
B003L20ICE|3.0|\\"The Kids Are All Right\\", directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko, is a traditional family drama set in a non-traditional family. Nic (Annette Bening) and longtime partner Jules (Julianne Moore) live an upper-middle class lifestyle in suburban California with their teenaged children Joni (Mia Waskikowski) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson), whose biological father was the same anonymous sperm donor. Nic is a controlling, uptight obstetrician and the family's breadwinner, while Jules is a bohemian type who has just started a landscaping business. The children take steps to find their biological father Paul (Mark Ruffalo) without their parents' knowledge, and, when the moms meet him, Paul's presence complicates their relationship considerably.<br /><br />It strikes me that if this storyline were applied to a heterosexual family, it would be banal. I'm not sure it's interesting here either, frankly. The relationship the women have with their children seems overdramatic and contrived. Paul is obviously thrown in there to be a catalyst for family tensions. The cast is pretty good, though. In hands less skilled than Annette Bening's, Nic would simply be a domineering neurotic. Mark Ruffalo deserves a lot of credit for playing a guy whom the audience doesn't know whether to like or hate, a nice guy who does hurtful things. But the children are a little underwritten, and Joni doesn't act her age. I really don't think much of the script. It begins with a comedic bent and ends up maudlin and trite. But I like the cast.
1594202842|4.0|I have to give Amy Chua kudos for all the publicity she's getting with this thought-provoking book.  It is an entertaining read, although quite short, and she is incredibly candid.  My critique is of the book, not her parenting methods.  I think it would have been far better for her to publish this book in a few years when she had some time to reflect a little more on what it really does mean to live life to the fullest. The author's actions seem to indicate that individual achievement is the overriding goal of parenting. The book ends too abruptly-probably because she's still busy mothering her girls and the story isn't over yet.  I think if she had reflected more on her journey it would have made for a better, more satisfying conclusion.
0240816250|4.0|\\"Way Beyond Monochrome\\" is a broad reference on primarily film-based black-and-white photography for advanced amateur and semi-professional photographers. Though there is more information on digital imaging than in the first edition, it is limited to digital capture, digital sensitometry, and digital negatives for silver-gelatin printing. This is a large, heavy volume, 10 inches square and 1.5 inches deep. It touches on most techniques in black-and-white photography and printing, even some obscure and highly specialized, in more than 80 chapters, is highly technical at times, with an emphasis on the science behind the process, but it does not try to be comprehensive or thorough on any subject.<br /><br />The authors outline the basics, the science behind them, and introduce the reader to some advanced printing techniques, all with beautiful photographic examples. It's a good reference for introducing photographers to the craft or for refreshing the memory of those who have done it before. But, if you're new to darkroom printing or to any of its many creative options, you'll probably want a book dedicated to that particular topic as well, for more step-by-step instruction. \\"Way Beyond Monochrome\\" has 3 parts: The Basics, The Science, and Odds and Ends, subdivided into 10 sections, plus an Appendix and an Index. There are review questions at the end of each section for those who want to make sure they've mastered the concepts.<br /><br />Part 1, The Basics, begins with an explanation of the human visual system, how dark room skill transforms an image, and the principles behind \\"the synergy of image, negative, and print quality\\" before moving on to the hands-on stuff: timing print exposure, paper and print contrast, archival processing, toning, mounting and matting, print spotting, framing. And Brooks Jensen weighs in on the question of whether or not to limit the edition. Part 2, The Science, gives the reader an overview of the Zone System, and introduction to sensitometry, the science of sharpness, depth of field, and focus, negative exposure and processing, contrast control, and using masks, split-grade printing, and print flashing. There are also chapters on pinhole photography, making digital negatives for contact printing, and creating a silver-gelatin print from an inkjet print.<br /><br />A section called \\"On Assignment\\" that is some 50 pages long contains a lot of short chapters that address a particular technique using a particular example. There are some interesting creative techniques showcased, and the focus on a particular image is helpful. Part 3, Odds and Ends, talks about photographic equipment and building a darkroom, including some useful \\"Tools, Tips and Tricks\\". The Appendix includes an introduction to darkroom chemistry for non-chemists, and tables and templates for topics discussed in the book. This is an impressive broad reference work for analog black-and-white photography and silver-gelatin printing. I'm glad I have it.

B002HFP0R4|4.0|I received Mythology yesterday, and am more than pleased with my purchase ! Imagine - each brother, including Andy, a cd of thier very own ! So, naturally I listened to Maurice's first, ( I listened to it twice ), and was blown away . Maurice was the glue of the trio, and the one we never got to hear that often,my favorite of the brothers too, and was so impressed. The Bridge, the  very last song on the cd that he did with his kids is outstanding - this alone is worth the purchase, for me. I then scanned through Barry's, as his is more like a greatest hits cd, but Robin's was the most enjoyable as there were of course the hits that he sang, ( Mining Disaster, I Started A Joke, Massachusetts, ect ), but vintage Bee Gees as well . I have yet to hear Andy's cd - and honestly speaking, I was never a fan of his , but then again I never really gave him a chance then - now I will with the addition of his cd on this set . It is packaged very nicely with pictures and comments by artists like Elton John, Frankie Vali, Tom Jones and Billy Corgan . Yes, I do recomend it !
1439153663|5.0|Kitchen House had my complete attention from the very first chapter.  Although certain parts of this book were hard to read because of the times the story is set in, this was one of the best books I have ever read.  I found myself thinking about these people during the day ........ I worried about them and prayed things would work out for them.  And I didn't want to finish the book because I knew I would miss all of these characters (and I do).  I only hope Ms. Grissom sees fit to write a sequel. Because Kitchen House ends in the early 1800's, I am sure there is much more story to tell.
B004DK49DW|4.0|I was first introduced to Social Distortion when Mike Ness was being interviewed for the release of \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell.\\"  As he talked about his musical influences he mentioned Creedence and John Fogerty.  Well, as a HUGE CCR/Fogerty fan I had to rush out and get SBHH and I was not disappointed.  To this day, it is one of my all time favorite records and the song, \\"Born to Lose\\", is the ultimate song of rebellion.  Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is a great guitar record and Mike Ness has to be one of the most underrated guitar players around today.  This record is definitely not the SD that came out of Orange County in the early 80s, but that's the beauty of the music.  I like the direction this record takes.  Songs like \\"California (Hustle and Flow)\\", \\"Can't Take it With You\\" and \\"Still Alive\\" are the kind of guitar oriented songs that I will be playing over and over for a long time to come.  My only complaint:  I WANT MORE SONGS!!

B003VSVWA0|5.0|I have followed Leonard Cohen's career amd songs from the 1960's until today. I cherish and recommend to everyone \\"The Essential Leonard Cohen,\\" as it is a history of his (my? our?) journey in this life. I will always hold the \\"Live in London\\" CD and DVD dear to my heart as a welcome \\"come back.\\" I was one of the first to wait in line to purchase tickets for his concert in Cleveland during his latest tour.  Thank you, Leonard: I appreciate your talent, your heart, your compassion, and your soul. Upon watching this latest release, \\"Songs from the Road,\\" I realize, accept, and embrace the realization of our common Buddhist philospphy:  we grow, we suffer and learn, and we age... I can appreciate your (our?) journey in life.  We are all getting older. Of course, I can see the effects that stress has had on Leonard since I saw last him in Cleveland. I can see what this world tour has taken on him; however, I will forever appreciate his devotion to his poetry and music. Who am I to criticize his latest performacnces because he appeares to some as tired and/or old?  That his voice is not as strong and deep as it once was? Yes, he has aged and appears frailer -- he is OLDER!! So what??  Take this DVD/CD for what is it: a celebration of Leonard Cohen's life.  How many of us can do it with such finesse and beautiful compassionn as Leonard when we are his age? Bless you, Leonard Cohen.  I hope I am not alone in appreciating your life, your music, your lyrics, and, especially, YOU!!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I am using this with an early 2009 Mac Mini in order to connect the machine to our 52\\" Sony Bravia XBR9 HDTV.  Installation and configuration was fast and easy. The only thing I needed to do on the TV was to set it to FULL PIXEL so that there was no overscan from the Mini.  Display setting on the Mac's display preference is 1080p.  Since this model of Mac Mini does not send audio through the MDP, the only other thing I needed to do was to connect a TOSLINK audio cable to the Mini's digital audio output and then on to my Cables to Go TOSLINK switcher in order to get the audio into the system.  Everything is working great and I am getting 1080p resolutions from the video output of the MIni along with full 5.1 and DTS audio from my collection of TV shows and Movies.  I am using a program called PLEX for OSX to manage and catalog my video collection along with three external hard drives to hold all the media files.    If you own a Mac Mini that does not have HDMI output, there is really no need to spend the money on buying one of the new machines that does offer this output.  This adapter will give you the same output quality and the 2 GhZ Mini is plenty fast enough to handle anything I have thrown at it, including Blu-ray transfers without compression.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Since I read the first four books in the series well over a year ago, I had to go back and re-read them all before this book was published, and I'm really glad I did.  It kept the dangling questions at the forefront of my mind.  Ms. Moning answers all of them, except one.  And the one she doesn't answer, she makes us understand the fact that Mac is fine without an answer, so I am good with that!    This book is an emotional roller coaster of a ride, from who was the protective beast that Mac kills, to who killed her sister and who is the Unseelie King.  Not to pat myself on the back, but I knew who the beast was, who it had to be to make any sense at all.  However, I was pretty thrown by the plot twists surrounding the Unseelie King and the Sinsar Dubh. And it was pretty heartwrenching to find out who the beast under the garage was.    Everything was tied up really well, there is a HEA, and the story is complete, but I still felt really sad that I am no longer inhabiting that world.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I bought these after buying Call of Duty and needed something to quiet my gaming sessions since I play well into the night and live with other people in my home.  Setup was pretty easy, took me 5 minutes to set it all up and I was good to go.  Discomfort only starts happening after I've been playing after 2 hours, but a quick break takes care of that.    I like how there are two separate volume controls, one for the game volume and one for the chat.  You can also mute yourself if you want and can still hear others talk if you want.      What I didn't like about this headset is that after 3 weeks of owning them, the sound on the right cup would start to not work and you could BARELY hear any sound coming from it.  The left is fine, but ever since it started happening I will only get full sound from the left side about 50% of the time.  I'm not sure why this is, I set them down gently after each time I play with them, so i know its not a matter of me being rough with them or anything.  Another thing is too, sometimes people will tell me that they can't hear me when I am speaking loud and clearly.  Not sure what that is either.    Overall, it seems like its constructed well and comfort wise its ok.  I'm really disappointed though that they stopped working properly after 3 weeks of owning them.  Maybe I should have paid heed to others' warnings on here.  I don't have a lot of spending cash, so I really had to save for a while to purchase this headset.    I probably will not buy from Turtle Beach for my next headset because of these issues.  Its not fun playing when i can only hear from one side of my ears.  :(
B0030V0PEW|4.0|I just finished reading a book called, 'The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right,' written by Atul Gawande. It looked very interesting to read since the idea that complicated situations could be managed properly if a well-made checklist were used. It was not my idea though to read this book, but rather my friend's confession that he got a lodestar to get things right by reading this book.<br /><br />Soon I bought the book through Amazon.com for my kindle and read it completely.<br /><br />Atul Gawande, who is also a general and endocrine surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, demonstrated how a single papar of checklist can help people get things right even in complicated situations, such as the aviation industry, the financial industry, the construction industry, and ICUs. He also described how he made his own medical checklist through his own experimental experience in WHO and showed that the checklist he made in fact worked well by reducing surgical operation errors.<br /><br />However, it was not clear how the knowledge learned from reading this book can be applied for our daily business, nor how the checklist for my business can be made.<br /><br />The checklist well made can indeed help reduce any potential errors or save a person's life. Nevertheless, it doesn't make complicated situations simpler or manageable. Moreover, making a good checklist means that we already know or anticipate any potential risks involved, which also points out that any situation with a good checklist would not be complicated any more.

B002IYEQR4|1.0|It's not so much that I dislike the thing itself more than that I simply don't feel like spending the current price of 80 U.S. Dollars on it... I would imagine that it had a limited retail, unlike it's DVD counterpart, which goes for 15 dollars.
B0034G4P7Q|2.0|Maybe its just me, but i found this to be only mildly interesting, neither insightful nor emotionally engaging, a well-paced but empty rehash of Citizen Kane. I'm not a big fan of Facebook and don't see it as a revolutionary advance, and so that could be part of why I don't get the hype about it. What's next, a movie about the inventor of Redbox, a love and status starved nerd convinced of his own brilliance, who, after boasting about his SAT scores and being rejected by a cashier at his local Blockbuster, stole the idea from a buddy who loads candy in vending machines...

B003ZSH606|1.0|I first fell in love with Jamiroquai when a friend lent me their album \\"Return of the Space Cowboy\\" back in 1995 when I was a senior in high school. That CD stayed in my 5 disc player for years! I remember being mesmerized by the wonderful soul, funk and jazz vibes reminiscent of an early Stevie Wonder. I was entranced by the groovy bass lines laid out by the very talented Stu Zender. So infatuated with the album, I decided to pick up the bass guitar.    During that time, I learned they had an earlier album \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\". I immediately rushed out to buy it and I've been a HUGE Jamiroquai fan since.     As the years moved on, I've purchased each of their albums and loved every one of them, even the blatantly commercial \\"Traveling Without Moving\\" and disco infused \\"A Funk Odyssey\\". I even have the very rare wooden crate box set featuring tons of their B-sides and remixes. I've seen them live. I've seen band members come and go. I've seen Jay Kay evolve as an artist. Regardless of whatever direction he decided to take, I've enjoyed everything that he had to offer.    And then came \\"Rock Dust Light Star\\". I will go on record as a faithful Jamiroquai fan for over 15 years: this album is absolutely horrible. The music is soulless and generic. Everything about the definitive Jamiroquai sound is completely erased. Not a single song stands out as anything memorable. And what's with the album cover? I mean, really JK? The smile itself is cringe-worthy.    I had very high hopes since its announcement. The five year hiatus was entirely too long and I felt a longing for a return of good vibes. After buying the album, I immediately listened to the entire thing. Then I listened again. Then again. Then one more time for good measure. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the first time EVER that I had to struggle through a Jamiroquai album.     I tried. I really tried to like it. But alas, I'm here to recommend completely ignoring this album and buying any of the previous ones.

B002ZG994U|5.0|As a fan of the original TV series, I was skeptical of the movie. I was extremely delighted to find that the movie is true to the characters I came to love watching.     There was no disappointment in the action, the attitude, and the portrayals. NO disappointment in the story line.    I'd like a sequel!
0553381687|2.0|First off, let me say that I can't stop reading this book. The plot is very engaging and the epic fantasy world well-built.<br /><br />But I hate that I can't stop reading it (I'm only halfway through, but have no fear that the second half will invalidate my points). My shelves are full of books with bookmarks halfway through, books that I couldn't finish because something felt false and dishonest about them - characterizations, plot conveniences - that just ruined them for me. If you've had the same experience, you may want to stay away.<br /><br />The author resorts to every possible cheat to move his plot along. Extremely competent characters make gross errors in judgement at convenient points. Characters act completely inconsistently with their established behavior. Impossible coincidences occur regularly to get characters into or out of a jam. Laws and traditions are introduced which make no sense whatsoever (allowing a duel to settle the outcome of a trial?), merely to get the author out of a plot hole. At least six times in the first half, I've had to stop reading because I was so irritated with these shenanigans. I'm surprised that so many reviews have praised the author's writing (there are plenty of other problems - telegraphed plot twists, omnipresent hyperbole, flat characterizations).<br /><br />But as I said, I always return to it because I have to know what happens next. Maybe you won't mind any of this, maybe it'll drive you crazy too. It all depends on what you expect from a book.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Gladiator has always been one of my favorite movies.  I was excited when it was first released to blu-ray, but was disappointed to see many reviews saying that it was poorly mastered.  With the news that it had been remastered and the quality was great, I thought I'd take a chance and order it from Amazon.  When I received it I was a bit worried...mine had the white UPC and the [...] rebate that expired in June of last year on the cover.  Upon closer inspection, I found that the words \\"2 Disc Set\\" did not appear above the Paramount logo on the back, right-hand side of the case which has been a reliable indicator of the remastered version.  I opened it, and compared the number on the back, inner-ring of the disc to the confirmed number that Paramount has you check for the exchange program, and it matched!  I hope that Amazon is only selling the remastered version at this point.  I can finally retire my DVD copy of Gladiator.  If you like the movie, you owe it to yourself to order the blu-ray!
0547391005|5.0|I ordered this book because my wife said that my son enjoyed the Curious George books they have at school. He is in Kindergarten and beginning to read, but still enjoys being read too. This collection includes two CD's with dramatic readings of the included stories . The readers do a wonderful job with the stories, and fun jazzy music is used to further enhance the mood of each of George's adventures. My son loves to sit and listen to the stories as he turns the pages. His sisters often join in. This compilation of stories is a must have.
030746363X|5.0|The book provides some very useful tips and hints at producing some serious results with the scientific backup to prove it. That's the greatest part of the book is that after every single instruction Tim gives out the actual evidence that the plan works. The book can be read from first to last page however I recommend that anyone that picks it up just use the book as a instruction guide only reading the items that you legitimately need. I've finished my first two weeks of the Slow Carb diet and have lost 15 pounds already with no exercise. The proof is in the pudding... it works.

B00275EHJG|5.0|This one seems to depend somewhat more on the age of the kid - although from what I've seen all ages really enjoy it - the older kids seem to be more able to appreciate the somewhat \\"deeper\\" emotions involved - especially at the end. This is a really fine addition to the series - once again able to hold the attention of all ages. I originally saw it at the theater with a seven-year old and he was unusually quiet during the ending and to my surprise, I had tears in my eyes at the end (for those who haven't seen it - it IS a happy ending - but nostalgic).  Highly recommended.

B00383UJ2U|5.0|I've recently discovered this band and I LOVE THEM!!! Yes, they do remind me of Depeche Mode & Pet Shop Boys but they have a unique sound of their own. The lyrics are simply touching paired with hauntingly melodious music and the singer's voice is hypnotic. It's a shame that they aren't playing more music like this in the US. To me they are the male equivalent to Florence & The Machine (another gem band). I hope they keep up what they are doing and I'm looking forward to their next album.

1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House uses sentimentality--much like The House Behind the Cedars--to expose the horrors of slavery and the ramifications of racial division on whites and blacks, husbands and wives, and parents and children. It is at times hard to read, do to a never ending string of depressing, brutal events. However, I do not think it could be told any other way; the victims of slavery often suffered greatly and their lives were full of despair and unhappiness. So even though at times I wanted the book to take a happier course it was unrealistic for me to expect it. The characters really make this book come to life; they have such personalities and are well developed. I was a little bit annoyed with Lavinia's naïveté in the middle of the book, when she's contemplating marriage and believes Will is the father of Belle's child. It seemed that she was too old to have not made a connection to past events and therefore the believability was somewhat shaky.              The book questions the ideas of family and what it means to be family. The book strongly demonstrates that love and loyalty define a family, rather than biological ties. However, I felt the ending, especially the last paragraph, contradicted this idea. As I saw it, the last paragraph showed that Belle finally got the recognition she deserved--being Pyke's daughter--and was buried as an equal next to her white family members. However, I thought she would have wanted to be buried with Mama Mae, Baby Henry, and the other people who loved her and made up her true family, not with a father ashamed of her illegitimacy, a half-brother who raped her, and a stepmother who constantly accused her of being a whore. It seemed to me that if Mama Mae and Belle were buried up at the big house, it would symbolically represent change.              Despite these things, I thoroughly enjoyed The Kitchen House and thought it was heartfelt tale of a discomforting time in our history.

0316113506|4.0|\\"Spark\\" is readable, while at the same time,  scientific (filled with medical and biological terms) book describing the mind-body connection. It is rich with evidence that exercise is the best way to stay healthy. John Ratey's clear description of what goes on in our bodies, more specifically our brains, when we engage in physical movement (exercise) will create a sense of urgency to take action, not only as individuals but also within our schools and medical practices.<br /><br />Dr. John Ratey's \\"Spark\\" delivers research and case studies proving that exercise can be a reliable treatment for everything from depression to ADD to addiction to aggression to menopause to Alzheimer's. The message is simple and consistent throughout the book - exercise helps our brains against disease, contributes to improved cognitive capabilities and enriches our lives as we grow older.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated the many case studies woven through the book that focused on the cognitive benefits; imagine a school district of 19,000 kids who implemented a health program and as a result gained an academic achievement of a first place in a world of science test score.<br /><br />As a reader, I asked myself, \\"with all this evidence, why aren't we making it mandatory to get our kids moving, and why are care givers and clinicians not more readily prescribing exercise?\\" I had the emotional reaction to want to shout out to our schools, our governments, our corporations - \\"people stop the drugs, get off the couch and START MOVING!\\"

B0048O2002|5.0|There are not enough stars to describe this movie. As with any movie, if the entire book were portrayed, the movie would take eight hours. Therefore they could only show the relevant parts and had to do some voice over action to explain the missing logic. But they did not change the plot or the essence of the plot. And I would not think in a million years that Donald Sutherland would be picked to play Henry Faber. Yet now that I see the movie, He is the only person that could be believable as an attractive aloof German spy. Where did they find Kate Nelligan, who played Lucy so well? The island \\"Isle of Mull, Scotland, UK\\" looked just like the book. I am glad this is on DVD, as the as tapes tend to ware out.<br /><br />Hitler must ultimately decide what threats are real and when.

Then they have to find him. If they can find him, can they stop him?<br /><br />The story line is intriguing. Yet it is the people interaction (loyalty, love, and credibility) and the attitude of \\"The Needle\\" that make the story. Ultimately the question is will he succeed and what effect will this have on future generations of those who knew him?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0007ZEOQE The Man Who Never Was ~ Clifton Webb]]

1400079144|5.0|I have to say right off the bat that a lot of readers apparently didn't like The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown.  Maybe their expectations were so high after The Da Vinci Code that no author could live up to them.  I don't know.  For me, The Lost Symbol was a pure joy to read.  I understand that people often view things differently from each other, but I'm amazed by the sheer outrage this book seems to have stirred up during the past year.<br /><br />Anyway, The Lost Symbol takes place in Washington, D.C. and has Paul Langdon trying to save the life of his close friend, Peter Solomon, while attempting to unravel the hidden codes of the Freemasons and the effect they had on the founding of our nation.  Sounds interesting, doesn't it?<br /><br />When Paul Langdon is asked by an old friend/mentor to give a lecture in Washington, D.C. at the spur of the moment, Langdon agrees and flies to the nation's capital from Boston.  Once he reaches the Capital building, Langdon quickly discovers something is wrong and that he's been duped by a very clever impostor who calls himself, Ma'lak.  Ma'lak is a giant of man with his muscled body tattooed with archaic symbols.  He's also highly intelligent, rich, and seeking the hidden portal that supposedly leads to enlightenment and is discussed in the ancient doctrines of Freemasonry.  He firmly believes the portal is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C.  Ma'lak has threatened to kill Peter Solomon if Langdon doesn't assist him in locating the portal by midnight.  To prove how serious he is about finding it, Ma'lak has left Peter Solomon's severed hand lying on the floor of the Capital building with clues to help Langdon along in his quest.  Langdon, however, must deal with a C.I.A. section's chief, seeking to stop Ma'lak in achieving his goal, believing the results will tear the country apart.  Langdon doesn't know what to think because all is not what it seems.  It doesn't take Langdon long to realize he doesn't know whom to trust.  With the clock ticking to the inevitable countdown, our Harvard professor races to unlock the secrets of our founding fathers and to find a portal that may exist or may not.  If it does, then it will offer the answers to the ancient mysteries of mankind.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, the author clearly states that the scientific research he discusses in his novel is actually being carried out today.  I just recently had a debate with someone who stated The Lost Symbol was nothing but fiction and had no bases for reality.  I totally disagreed with him because though I don't have a background in science, I do try to stay abreast of the current research in quantum physics, astronomy, and the understanding of the human mind in its relationship to the Universe.  I've also followed many of the discoveries that have been done in the area of Noetic Sciences throughout the last twenty-five years.  What's discussed in The Lost Symbol blew me away its authenticity and how it's carefully woven into the plot.  Brown definitely did his research and used the scientific evidence that's out there as a basis for his fantastic novel.  This is part of the reason why the book was so entertaining.  Clearly, not everyone who read the novel had the same reaction as I did, but what can I say.<br /><br />If anyone out there has the slightest interest in man's quest to understand his place in the Universe, then check this book out for some interesting food for thought.  On top of that, it's also a damn good read that has each chapter ending with a twist that literary compels the reader to go on to the next one.  The Lost Symbol is certainly one of the best books I've read in the past decade, and I highly recommend it.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading every book in this series. I am glad I started reading the books late in the game so I didn't have to wait as long for the last two books. The Fever Books are my favorite books of all time. It has had heartbreaking emotion, steamy sex, laugh-out loud moments, mystery, and suspense. I love the world and characters that Karen as created. The Fever Series are 100 times better than her highlander books. I have read and enjoyed some of her highlander books, but I have loved all of her Fever books!! I know that that highlander books are a different genre romance/fantasy. While the Fever series are so much more mystery/fantasy/romance/epic adventure. I thought the romance in the fever series was way hotter! In the highlander books, the plot besides the romance usually bored me, once the characters got together I lost interest in the stories. There was way more going on in the fever series, to hold my interest. I have really been getting more into paranormal/ sci fi / fanatasy books more than I use to be. I have always loved mysteries and romance. I loved all the questions and unknowns that Karen created in the story and she didn't leave us hanging I was extremely satisfied with the ending.     ******************Spoiler**********************************************  ************************************************************************  I loved the twists at the end where we find out that Vlane is not who we thought he was.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have enjoyed the resurgence of legitimate actors filming action movies.  Action movies aren't high art, but having the likes of Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and Morgan Freeman make any film better.  Their roles made the film fun, unpredictable, and satisfying.  The action scenes are over the top, but they don't overshadow the characters.  This is where The Expendables missed the boat.  Highly recommend this movie!
0385341679|5.0|This series is the best i've ever read hands down. Its intelligent, riveting and keeps you guessing until the end. This book was a fantastic conclusion, it cannot be read as a stand alone. The one thing I wished for was a more protracted romance between Barrons and Mackayla, a little something more.     I for one am looking forward to the next three novels set in the same fever world.

030726999X|1.0|The Stieg Larsson trilogy is all hype.  It took me two tries to get into the first book, the girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which should have been my clue not to proceed with that or the other two.  However, after the first 44 pages the first book took off and it wasn't too bad so I ordered the other two for my kindle.  Having ordered them I read them.  The Girl Who Played with fire was starting to get a little too perverted for my taste but, I hung in there. By the third book, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest, I began to judge the books.  The books gave too much information about situations and about characters.  I am all for character development but, much of the information was superfluous. For example:  did we really need to know that Berger and her husband liked threesome sex and that they took and kept pictures of that sex?  Did salander really have to pick up the married guy in Gilbrater for casual sex?  It seemed everyone was into casual sex with everybody.  The plot information was confusing, more complex than needed to write a book about rape,sex and perversions. And finally:  Really a petite young women shot in the shoulder, hip and HEAD, buried in a shallow grave, digs herself out with a cigarette case... Diane Quinn
0132350882|4.0|I especially liked the sections having to do with comments.  We copy and paste code a lot, so that the comments are not just obsolete but wrong.  This book has caused me to think about each comment and whether it's necessary.  If it is, then maybe I need to redo my code so that the comment is no longer needed.
B00076NYFU|4.0|I can't help but wonder if Status Quo (at least for this particular album) is like the dorkier, British equivalent of Poco.  Status Quo is, according to this album, a party band with slight blues and country tendencies, but mostly centered around hard rock.  However that's not necessarily a bad thing.  These songs are definitely catchy and fun.  Hello *is* a great album.    It's just that, you know, Poco has (in my opinion at least) better songwriting skills.  At least, I feel a stronger connection towards Poco's songwriting because they write songs that feel personal and emotional.  Status Quo is all about throwing parties and having fun (which isn't a problem of course- it's just that there's literally *thousands* of party bands out there, so a band like Status Quo was almost immediately doomed to become forgotten.      Honestly, if you told me Status Quo was actually an American band, I would have totally believed it.  They certainly SOUND American.    However, to give a compliment, Status Quo blows away Poco and most country rock artists in one category- the guitar solos, simply because the guitar playing is phenomenal.  Very melodic licks from beginning to end, I can't help but wonder just how underrated of a guitarist the guy from Status Quo is.  He deserves more attention and praise.    \\"Forty-Five Hundred Times\\" is probably the magnum opus of the entire album.  The vocal melody is a bit weak, but when the guitar jam eventually arrives around the 4-minute mark, the song then completely morphs into something better and totally rocks the joint for the remainder of the song.   I hate to ruin the positive momentum here, but some of those guitar licks *do* remind me of a certain Wishbone Ash song from their classic Argus album (\\"Time Was\\").      In fact a good portion of Hello reminds me of Wishbone Ash which is yet another British band that always felt influenced by the late 60's/early 70's American country movement.  However given a choice between a secondrate American country/rock band like Pure Prairie League or a British version of the same thing... well, Status Quo is easily better thanks to the excellent guitar solos.    \\"Claudie\\" seriously reminds me of Neil Young's \\"Roll Another Number (For the Road)\\" in the way the vocal melody is sung, but it's a good song regardless.    Actually I'm a really big fan of \\"Roll Over Lay Down\\".   It's a fast-moving boogie rocker with magnificent vocals and guitar playing.  An easy highlight.  \\"Caroline\\" is a bit repetitive but all in good fun, so it's harmless.       Speaking of Wishbone Ash, the first few notes of \\"And It's Better Now\\" remind me of the early version of Wishbone Ash.  It also sounds like an attempt to write a Beatles-like song with the amount of sincerity in the vocal melody.  It's a good song.  \\"Blue Eyed Lady\\" has the same Wishbone Ash-like intro before quickly morphing into what actually reminds me of early Aerosmith a little bit.  Listen to that guitar riff and tell me it doesn't sound \\"rough and ready\\" like a typical 70's Aerosmith song.  As for the vocal melody, well it's a bit generic but I like it anyway.    \\"Joanne\\" is a really good bonus track.  It should have been on the regular album back in 1973 when the album was released.    Overall, Hello is a really likable album for rock fans- just don't expect originality or amazing songwriting skills.  Expect a quality party album.
0982743726|5.0|The Bone Sword is the debut novel of Walter Rhein. As a fan, and somewhat avid reader, of fantasy I am happy to admit Mr. Rhein into the ranks of authors of whom I shall take note and whose books I shall look for.<br /><br />The Bone Sword sets the scene for a revolution in a fantasy setting, where the church has ultimate sway and power, even over the ruling class who care little for the plight of the common folk and who feel that their position is by divine right. We are introduced to 2 children, twins, one of whom has the ability to heal, and a lone warrior who left behind the elite force he was trained to join.<br /><br />In many ways, the novel serves as a warning against the interference of church in matters of state, as people are tortured and killed in the name of religious fanaticism. Indeed, some could argue that the novel could potentially reflect on current times, where those in power seem to care little for the actual people, and that the people should rise up to take back power...although I do not honestly believe that was the author's intent, and that he meant this purely as some light work of fantasy.<br /><br />Rhein develops his characters nicely, particularly of Malik, the elite warrior who is fighting the ghosts of his own past, while struggling to help the twins, and finds himself going from an outcast to a leader. The interactions between characters seem fairly realistic, and thus more believable. The chapters are short, making it fast paced...and usually led me to read \\"just one more\\" chapter until I read far more than I'd planned.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is its relative size. In the age of epic sagas, 230 pages seems somewhat short, and definitely left me wanting more when I reached the end. That being said, Mr. Rhein has set the stage for potentially developing a saga out of this novel - this particular battle may well be won, but the consequences and overall war may be far from over.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and will keep an eye out for future work by Mr. Rhein.by Mr. Rhein.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This is one of those suspense flicks where you have to pay *complete* attention to every single detail leading up to the conclusion or you'll REALLY be lost. In my case... well, I was lost by the conclusion because I didn't understand what actually happened. I didn't understand the ending.     To put it another way- throughout the film you witness unusual events, and eventually the puzzle pieces slowly unravel a little bit at a time.     Christian Bale's character is really convincing and delivers perfect edge of your seat suspense. You keep wondering if he's losing his mind because of his evergrowing refusal to eat any food resulting in his body growing skinnier and alarmingly weaker by the day, and where the hangman parts of the storyline are heading (you'll understand what I mean when you watch it). You see, Bale's character would return home from work and constantly see hangman drawing on his refrigerator door, and he'd need to fill in the letters and put the body parts on the hangman in order to solve the clues.     I have to admit, I really didn't get the ending. I don't want to spoil the puzzle pieces leading up to the conclusion because it's inappropriate to ruin storylines for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask a question in the next paragraph pertaining to the storyline, and I warn everybody who hasn't seen the movie yet- do NOT read this next part of my review because it's a spoiler-     My main question is- who WAS that bald headed guy (John Sharian's character) who'd occasionally make an appearance? Was he just a hallucination the entire time? He was the character responsible for my confusion. I believe I understood the rest of it.  Then again, if he was a crucial part of the storyline, maybe the entire thing went completely over my head.  Who knows.
0385341679|5.0|I'm not going to review the book by break it down. I will not be able to do so without giving something away.  I just wanted to say that you will love this book if you've read the others in the series.  I had high expectations for this final book in the Fever series, but KMM far exceeded them for me.  I love to be surprised and I was all through the book.    I look forward to her next series where I expect we'll be seeing many of these characters return.
B003JTHESA|4.0|I have heard better Maiden before, but I have heard worse.  Maiden's songs seem to be getting longer and longer 9-10 min each. The title scares me - is this the final frontier?
B0000C8AV2|5.0|I'm a certified Dylan-head and by contract with other Dylan-head's I have to review his stuff highly. This is great album. He has a bunch of them. In the 90's, I had pretty much given up on Dylans' new work since I had been disappointed so many times. Besides I was still enamoured with his old stuff and that was enough for me: \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"Planet Waves\\" -- you really can't go wrong. I saw a review in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine when this album came out in the early 90's. \\"Just when you thought Dylan was finished, he goes deep into the well again.\\"     The story is that Bono was at Dylan's house and asked him if he had any new material and Dylan pulled some stuff out of a dressor stand and showed it to him. Bono said he sould really reacord it since it was good and Dylan wasn't sure. That's when Bono got Daniel involved.     Anyway, There are a few gems on here. Its hard to rate music with stars. This was a good effort on Dylan's part. If you are a Dylan-head there's a few gems on here you got to have, simple as that. But if you're a Dylan-head you already know that.
B00133KDM8|4.0|It was definitely better than I expected.  I already knew a couple of the songs before purchasing the CD.  It takes a while to get used to with hearing Tarja's voice with a different band.  However it wasn't bad at all.
B000002LN9|5.0|This is probably Eric Clapton's best live set before he laid back into a more acoustic and bluesy mode.  Recommended for great playing, and crackling energy.  Part of the resurgence at this time was due to Eric Clapton's more commercial direction in the 80s and 90s - with Behind the Sun and Journeyman.  Clapton's playing was always better live and this album captures a good cross section of his best work at the time.  Every song works and gels well and establishes Eric as the rock / blues force he has always been.  Absent are Layla, and Forever Man, etc - but you don't really miss them.<br /><br />I have always felt that Clapton became a little more subdued as he aged - although the recent Clapton / Winwood set is a nice return to form as well and worth getting.
B0041VB8BO|5.0|All the other 5 star reviews are TRUE; I couldn't agree more with them.    Get this, I got this album (the non-deluxe version) late 2009...it is 2011, and there is NOT a day where I don't listen, dance, sing, envision(!) a fun. song. They stay FRESH!! I promise, it's a steal.
B004DMAZQK|4.0|I immediately thought of Depeche Mode with hints of Echo & the Bunnymen creeping in, updated for the 21st century (beat), only darker yet without being depressing. This is the first I've heard of White Lies and I came in to hear more of their work. What else can I say? Listen to the samples and you'll know if you like them or not fairly quickly. I listened to Ritual for the first time about 15 minutes ago and the entire album is going on my iPod for more intense listening. There were 2 songs (\\"Come Down\\" & \\"Power and Glory\\") that went immediatley to my highest rated list which is pretty rare from a band/CD that I've heard for the first time.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|This was a gift for my wife at Christmas, who was also expecting our first child.  She listened to it before the labor, and now while hanging out with the baby in the evening. She is a yoga instructor and plans to use it during some classes and practice, but right now it's awesome to just sit and relax too.
0385341679|5.0|Awesome all the way.  This is a magnificent series.  Characterization is phenomenal and the story is enthralling.  Twists and turns and revelations, what a thrill to read.  The writing is superb...definitely one of the best UF series out there.  And this final book is everything and more.  I loved how a couple of times my conclusions were mirrored by Mac's as things unfolded.  And we were both wrong!  And you find out EXACTLY what Barrons is!  We know exactly what Mac knows and if it's good enough for her, it's certainly good enough for the reader.    I'm excited to read the next book in this unique world.  Congratulations Ms. Moning...you hit a grand slam with this series.
B003VANOFY|1.0|If you have not yet purchased these yet, you need to be aware of the issues that these headsets have. Its not just some, it is ALL, users who posted good reviews probably did so right out of the box without actually using them in real world situations, If you do not believe me please check out the Logitech support forum for headsets at [...]    I don't know about you other G930 Users out there but personally I do not appreciate being scammed out of $160 or whatever you paid. These headsets are advertised to do things they do not at all do, Logitech doesn't seem to want to address that these problems even exist let alone repair them. To this point I have tolerated the standard issues that we are all having with them, now they have stopped working altogether and it will probably be 2 or more weeks before Logitech gets me another set which i will have to continue to tolerate all the short comings of. They don't even have the decency to send me a new set and let me put my old set in the packaging and return them, so that I am out for a shorter period, I would not mind giving them a Credit card number for security if they would make that a possible option.     Anyways enough about me, and without further ado:     The problems you will have if you purchase these:    Noise Cancelling does not work - Actually its severely irritating that I cannot have and open mic and friends complain even on PPT mode.    Sound out of only the right side in some apps - 7.1 huh? seems more like Mono to me... (Skype being one of these apps)    Crackling \ Distortion - This one is getting kind of old.     iTunes has serious issues with theses...      No Disable of the Auto power off function that cant seem to tell if the headset is actually in use and powers off the headset every 10 min in some apps.     Locked to Tape recorder 16khz Mic sound quality (not that it matters without noise cancelling I would need to have a sound booth to actually sound good on these and forget using my mouse or keyboard)    Restarts with headset turned on just to get it to sync with the USB plug so you can use it...     They finally just solved the Push to Talk not working with Ventrillo problem which was supposed to be a feature out of the box and never worked (4 months that I am aware of) Though I thank them for fixing this (it does demonstrate that they are willing to improve these and that they can be improved through drivers), this seemed a minor problem compared to the others listed.    and my newest problem  Unknown device - Windows no longer recognizes it and it will no longer work at all. Nothing changed on the computer it wasn't even after a restart, it just stopped working altogether, and this after only 3 months of ownership. I am patently waiting to receive a replacement from Logitech for this issue, only two more weeks without any sound at all to go!!!    In all fairness, the hardware itself does seem to be quality made. They have great potential but without addressing these problems they are but expensive paper weights, if you're into that type of thing cool, otherwise you may want to wait till a more complete version of these or their software is available.     This is sad to me that I am posting this review. I have always liked Logitech products and have been a great supporter of them for 15 or more years, always opting for Logitech keyboards and mice, webcams, speakers, remote controls, etc for myself and the companies that I consult for. I am currently typing this on my G15 Keyboard, next to it is my G13 Gamepad, my G500 Mouse, my F710 Gamepad, my Orbit AF webcam, a harmony remote, etc, but I count on headsets so as to not disturb the baby when I am gaming at night, and these have completely failed me.     Please take this into consideration before waisting your hard earned money.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|I've been a fan of the series from the start, way back when the first movie was released.  I can say that this one, the fourth in the series, puts me squarely in the middle on my opinions.<br /><br />The movie was good in general.  I give it 3 stars for general satistfaction.  If I were rating it on Mila alone, it would be 4 or 5 stars, but I must rate the movie as a whole.<br /><br />The Pro's:  The story continues the series well and picks up right where it left off.  Alice goes to Umbrella HQ to attack them, just as promised.  The storyline as a whole has good progression and is logical.<br /><br />The Con's:  Some things seem to be just dropped in as a tribute to the video games or simply as a cliche.  The big axe-wielding zombie from Resident Evil 5 is there for some reason. (???) In RE5, he had a reason for being there.  In Afterlife, it just seems contrived.  Also, this is not really a zombie movie, in my opinion.  There are some sequences where zombies do appear, but a vast majority of the movie isn't about zombies.  It's more about Alice vs. Umbrella.<br /><br />Anyhow, I was generally satisfied, and I didn't demand a refund on my movie ticket; however, the others in the series were better to me.
B004DK49DW|2.0|Zero excitement. Energy that is less than anemic. Lyrics that lack any punch. I'd say more, but that would require a second listen and, well, life is too short for that.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|I liked the series, even though it does have a few problems.<br /><br />The computer graphics in some places (namely blood splatters) could use a little work.  I liked the explosion in the last episode, it looked very realistic.  The characters are generally believable and well-played.  The storyline is interesting and doesn't feel contrived - most of the time.<br /><br />Which brings me to my main dislike:  the contrived.  ***Spoiler below***<br /><br />***Spoiler below...you have been warned...***<br /><br />The main character, Rick, is trying to find his wife and son.  They've been separated for three weeks.  The wife, Lori, is alive at a camp with the main character's partner, Shane.  Shane leaves the hospital and tells Lori that Rick is dead.  Within the three weeks after this news, even though Lori is portrayed the rest of the show as a loving and faithful wife, she sleeps with Shane.  When Rick returns, Lori is back at Rick's side, is angry at Shane, and wants nothing to do with him.<br /><br />To me, it feels somewhat contrived, as if there wasn't a point of conflict in the story and something had to be found to build on.  I understand that it's the apocalypse and \\"he's not coming back\\" and all that, but, if she's as faithful and loyal as she is portrayed, it would take alot longer than two or three weeks to get over her dead husband.  The fact that zombies were running loose throughout the countryside would probably be enough to keep me from wanting sex with anyone for some time, and certainly not in an open field.  But, that's just me.<br /><br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />Anyhow, I enjoyed everything in the series except that one bit.  I took off one star for the main point of conflict being a bit contrived, and for the price point they've put it up at.  It is a bit expensive for what you get.
1439107955|5.0|Interesting. Informative. Frightening facts. These several words say it all, as far as I am concerned. This non-fiction book is written like a thriller. The reader is the antagonist and cancer is the protagonist no one wants to meet.<br />Obviously, a great deal of research went into the writing of this book: Frightening research makes it all worth the reading, all 500 plus pages.<br />Everything you can possibly think about asking about cancer is included here. Well done and easily understood for a subject no one ever wants to encounter firsthand. I highly recommend this as a worthwhile read.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time. And the features in this one is ridic. It's worth it for the box and shimmeryness alone haha. this was $40 in stores, and I got it here for almost half of that. Awesomeness.
0385341679|5.0|This finale to the Mackayla Lane/Sinsar Dubh story line did not disappoint!  Every angle, plot line, character and question was resolved in a most satisfactory way.  Actually there are characters she could keep going with, so maybe this isn't the last book in the series.     I was home sick all day reading the book and finishing it, and considered myself lucky because I would not have been able to put it down for work or normal healthy workday interruptions.  It kept me engaged 100% from the first page to the last.    But if you're on book 5 of this series, I'm probably singing to the choir.  If you haven't read the first books in the series, it makes no sense to start with #5, but you're in for a treat with no waiting because you get to start with #1 and read straight through!  Clear your calendar first.
0307454541|5.0|I only get to enjoy casual reading on occasion and this book was a highlight on my winter break.  I do not typically refer books to people, but have been telling everyone about this book...can't wait until I have time to read the second book in the series.
B004DK49DW|5.0|Okay, nothing is perfect, Mike Ness sure as hell isn't perfect. BUT, this new album does not disappoint those who listen to the music, and listen to the lyrics. Money well spent if you ask me.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I've ever read.  A fanastic end to a fantastic series.  Completely satisfying (except I wish it wasn't over).  Terrific book, terrific series!  Thank you so much Ms. Moning.  A great achievement.  Definitely worth the wait!
159562015X|5.0|Strengths Finder was every bit as good as my friends had said it was.  I read the book first and then took the online test.  I couldn't believe how accurate the results were and I was able to then discuss them with friends who had also taken the test.  I really like that it offers steps to use your findings in everyday situations.
B003ES61EE|5.0|If your looking for a cleaner that cleans efficiently without scratching your lenses then this is it.  The brush is soft and easily cleans away dust and debris.  The other hard edge is perfect for getting into corners and cleaning out hard to remove dirt and or debris.  If your an independent film/maker or camera aficionado then this is a must have and will not take all day as its specifically designed to hit the most target areas of HD Cams, Handhelds, Dig cams, ect.  I am very happy with this cleaner and highly recommend.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|- It's a James Bond movie with a female lead character.     - It has some exciting action scenes but it's so implausible because of Angelina's small body. For example, the scene where Salt jumped over the rail of staircase and choked a bad guy with her handcuffs. So, I watched it with a bucket of salt!    - The pace is fast.    - The majority of the film is predictable.    - In short, it's worth watching once.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This was my first ever home workout video purchase. Hard at first, but by week two you can really see a difference in your body, which only makes you want to work out more!! I find myself passing up going to the gym bc I can get better results doing a 20min workout w/ Jillian than working out in the gym for 45min-1hr. Definitely worth the $8 I paid for it. Also I should mention Jillian does a great job motivating you and reminding you why you're working out in the first place. My husband is even challenged by the workouts. \\"Don't phone it in!\\"
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I think all of us have a little 'geek' in us, and watching the big bang theory allows us to see our own 'quirks' under the light of comedy so we can grow to appreciate ourselves and others a little more.....
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I first saw this video which has no script, just music, while listening to a symphony orchestra play the actual score.  I was enthralled with both the story and the music,but wondered if my very active grandchildren would be just as impressed. I sent them a copy and their mom reported that the whole group sat quietly and watched the whole video.  There is no better praise from that group!!!  I would add that one of the three year olds was upset when the snowman disappeared at the end.
0061122416|1.0|I am really mystified by the spectacular reviews for this novel.  I read it in my Young Adult literature class in college, and was absolutely stunned at how horrible it was.  The characters were hollow archetypes and the plot was as hackneyed as they come.  A coming of age story with absolutely no originality or character appeal.  What's worse is that the author is constantly beating you over the head with his message.  Maybe teenagers these days don't understand the point of a novel without it being shouted at them from every paragraph, but I found it obnoxious.  Also, the ideas represented in the novel are borrowed from Eastern philosophy (particularly Zen Buddhism and Taoism), but are not very well explained.  The only reason I understood the concepts was because I had a course on Taoism. I really wish I could reclaim the couple of hours of my life I wasted reading this book.
B00008V5VN|5.0|The title track is over an hour long so for God's sake if that's out of your comfort zone don't get it.  I was able to find the title track on both youtube and last fm beforehand and I recommend you do the same first and actually sit down and listen to it all before you decide to pay such a hefty amount for a hard copy.  From my point of view, as someone who does like it and stoner doom in general, this is a landmark recording and a must have. Committing the time it takes to listen through Dopesmoker just takes you to another place in your mind as you just... experience the hearing equivalent of tunnel vision, blanking out on everything else and just focussing on each and every note being played.  It really hits you though when it finishes, and you just sit back and think \\"........damn man, that was quite something....\\".  But I guess at the end of the day you shouldn't really go by the reviews. It's out there, go listen to it and see for yourself, and maybe you'll understand why us lot bought a copy.
0375707972|4.0|This book worked best for me as a sort of \\"parable\\", although I'm not certain to what extent the allegory--if any--was intended. Naive 15 year old Michael Berg is sick on the street and a woman cleans him up and guides him home. Later Michael's mother sends him by to thank the woman with a bouquet, and the pair begin a steamy, illicit (and illegal?) affair, part of their ritual being that Michael reads aloud to the woman, Hanna, until she mysteriously disappears. Years later Michael sits in on a trial for war-crimes and recognizes Hanna as one of the defendants. In terms of allegory, Michael seems to represent an idealistic German people besotted with--yet ignorant of--the alluring, dangerous fascist state and must come to terms with this love affair for the rest of his life. Also fascinating is the take on the postwar German generation who must grow up doubting/questioning the authority of their parents, the generation who allowed the holocaust to happen. For all these lofty themes, Michael's story is (mostly) related in simple, pared-down, stark prose that matches the subject matter well. Michael's occasional digressions into philosophy and law slow things down in the middle. Some of it comes off as authorial self-indulgence, perhaps, but also touches on some important and relevant aspects of guilt and laying blame. It can be difficult at times to identify with the perpetually moping Michael and cold Hanna (whose secret is fairly obvious early on). The ending left me rather cold and numb--the author's intent?--but I actually prefer the way the novel has recently transferred to the screen, especially the semblance of closure the film offers versus the open ending here.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have waiting like a lot of Maniacs for over five years to get my hand on shadowfever. Telling myself that karen will be kind to us fans, that her vision wasnt to make a horrific ending but something that left you breathless once it was over. It seemed to me like Karen became a whole other writer while creating this book. The first four were great, and i loved her writing and story, but this book was just insanely great! It is by far the best book i have ever read. It answered all my questions, while still leaving room for the series she will be writing afterwards. I reccommend this series, and all her books to anyone who loves reading, great story telling, and a way to loose yourself for countless hours!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I purchased this item for my 4 year old son. He is a daft punk fan and immediately fell in love with this film.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|The wait for this book was long but the payout so sweet! This book is priceless! KMM out did herself, ever word and sentence is beautifully constructed and the twist and turns just kept coming. This book deserves 10 stars, it's a must have!!
B0016PM722|3.0|I think $95.00 is too high for a toy to do nothing but light up and make a noise. Even the buttons are not real except to turn off/on. You better be a real fan and just display this fx lightsaber.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Seriously, Leo sucks, he has always sucked...so he has that tiny girly man thing going on? So what? It doesn't man he can act.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game probably around two weeks ago. I would categorize it as one of the better purchases of my life. I have never been that avid of a board game player - I enjoyed them when circumstance would have it but otherwise never went out of my way to play. This game, and this game only have changed that. It DOES play differently every time, and it will keep you having fun and occupied many times over, even among the same group of people. It is now the go to thing to do among my family and friends, and many are purchasing their own copy to play with their families after playing just once. We have nicked playing it \\"cataning.\\"    It is a little slow at first - upon opening the game and taking out the directions to read I was discouraged. They ARE well written - maybe I just had a lack of patience because of how much I wanted to just play it. The first few games may take quite a while - several hours. But after a few you really can finish up the game in an hour if everyone knows what they are doing.    About the durability... It has made it in an overstuffed carry on bag halfway across the country and back and has been fine. My only comment is that IF YOU LIVE IN HUMID CONDITIONS, the outside pieces will warp slightly and it does tend to get annoying. It is certainly not unmanageable but it does detract from my impression of it's durability slightly. Other than that the cards will wear just like any other deck of cards. I do not see durability as an issue with this game, just as I said if you are in humid conditions you may experience the outside \\"ring\\" to be a little frustrating.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Action scenes were A+ but the story line was lacking. If you are expecting a Band of Brother's experience, Pacific falls short. We follow three Marines, two recruits and one career Marine during WWII. The story jumps around and you never really get any real consistency in the lives of these characters. For me you jumped from one battle scene to the next, with little background on these three guys'.
B000I0QK74|4.0|I liked this CD it had some really good Christmas songs on it and the rest of my family liked them as well.   For the price it was a very good selection of music.
0399536108|4.0|This quick little book demands reading in one sitting. It is full of fun advice and fresh viewpoints. It's not the typical \\"get rich quick\\" self-help pap the bookstores are full of.  In fact, the author doesn't tell you HOW to do anything.  What he does instead is challenge the way you THINK.    I loved this volume - here's a quick sample of the kind of ideas he tosses your way:    1. By itself, money has no value.  2. Choosing between yourself and others is the wrong choice.  3. Changing the world is not always practical (practical can sometimes be code language used by critics to marginalize your choices of freedom)  4. You can plan for the future without deferring your life now  5. LIFE IS SHORT (don't waste time; take action; we tend to regret what we haven't done more than what we have)     He also cites a number of inspiring quotes, for example:  \\"Great spirits have always been violently oppressed by mediocre minds.\\" -Albert Einstein    For some people, these ideas will be life-changing. For others, they will at least challenge them somewhat.
0385341679|5.0|This book was great.  It tied up all of the loose ends perfectly.  I really hope she creates a spin-off of this series.  I read very few books twice, but this is definitely an experience I want to repeat.
B001E45XT4|2.0|I purchased this headset to use skype and ventrillo to keep in touch with my friends long distance. Fist off, I have a very large head, and the headset is fine after an hour or two of use, but it is noticeable after that on my monstrous head. The sound quality on my end is great, but all of my friends have complained of \\"popcorn\\". Thats what all of them have described as the sound that comes through with my voice. Sometimes its worse than others, and I think the problem is coming from the volume knob or mute switch, because whenever I fidget with it the problem gets worse. I don't know if I just got one that slipped past QC or what but for 25$ I couldn't have expected much. I use these for music still but am in the market for another microphone.
B004I2JVCO|5.0|I have loved the non-remastered bootlegs over the years, but we were long overdue for an official remastered live album and the band does not disappoint. Great mix of songs, especially with the newer tracks and covers. It is a must buy!
031603438X|5.0|LIFE will prove a 'must' for any library serious about rock music: it's been nearly seventy years in the making and details the story of Rolling Stones member Keith Richards's life, from his childhood in London to his relationships with the Stones and other musical proteges. This delves extensively into his personal experiences and observations, providing an intimate 'no holds barred' survey of all the influences and experiences that have contributed to his fame. Unparalleled in scope and perspective, it's a winner.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW  There are many, many things to love about Walt Disney's 1940 animated film \\"Pinocchio.\\"  The story boasts excellent, fully fleshed-out characters, the songs, including \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" and \\"I Got No Strings On Me\\" are some of the greatest numbers ever in a Disney production, and the movie presents at least five villains, if one includes Monstro.  Yet, I cannot love this movie unreservedly.  With the vocal talents of Dickie Jones, Cliff Edwards, and Christian Rub, \\"Pinocchio\\" is mostly phenomenal, though with some major differences from the original tale by Carlo Collodi.  For starters, both the cricket (according to Collodi, the animal was not given a proper name) and Pinocchio are immediately at harsh odds with each other.  Walt Disney also takes the liberty of significantly toning down Pinocchio's bratty rudeness from the book.  While the story and characters around him are intriguing, Walt Disney's re-conceived Pinocchio is actually a fairly boring hero.  I always felt somewhat cheated by Pinocchio's being essentially a completed puppet when Jiminy Cricket first comes into Gepetto's shop.  A montage of Gepetto carving the wood for him(laughing wood, no less) would have made more of a connection between the characters from the outset.  Walt Disney did make a powerful compromise by having Gepetto paint a smile onto Pinocchio.  By painting the smile, Gepetto is the author of Pinocchio's personality and the creative 'father' of the puppet, if not the literal 'father' of the would-be boy.  The movie is buoyed by villains who are unquestionably slippery and evil.  The fox and cat are slippery charmers who smoothly deliver the unsuspecting Pinocchio over to the svengali Stromboli.  Stromboli is very literally a puppetmaster, and the movie expertly massages the creative possibilities for outright horror that exist within a story about a puppet who wants to be a flesh-and-blood boy.  Finally, the coachman on the Pleasure Island excursion is themost extreme of all villains in the movie, a devil who oversees the transformation of young boys into mindless donkeys.  Symbolically, then, here Pinocchio sees the absolute worst side of his most cherished wish.  Basically, becoming a genuine boy also means experiencing genuine human cruelty and mortal and spiritual danger.  I will always miss the more rambunctious side of Pinocchio that Walt Disney chooses to ignore, and that decision makes this movie a little weaker than it could have been.  Still, it is an expertly rendered adaptation.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|The story hooks you and keeps your attention.  The characters are nicely contrasted, from monotone to compelling.  The direction and cinematography are outstanding.  It is for those reasons alone you should watch the movie because beyond that the story never quite lives up to its potential.    What you see is what you get right from the beginning of the movie; everyone is manipulating everyone else.  The plot twists are numerous but not surprising, lacking the wow factor that a political thriller should have in abundance.  The movie builds your anticipation to a point and keeps it there, never delivering the gut punches that would leave you reeling from an unanticipated visual left hook.  Knowing that fact in advance you can enjoy the movie for exactly what it presents; an interesting Middle East story that is a little too careful to avoid offending the wrong people.      Mark Strong presented the most enjoyable character portrayal as head of the Jordanian intelligence service.  Leonardo DiCaprio was his usual self.  And then there was Russell Crowe.  His name was the only real contribution to the film because his character and delivery were unremarkable.  I can think of a half dozen other actors better suited to the role; maybe they were busy.    There are Blu-rays and DVDs you purchase for a small fortune where you feel viewing after viewing it was money well spent.  Yeah, this ain't one of those.  Body of Lies at $10 for a Blu-ray or $1 to $6 for a used/new DVD is priced just right to enjoy the movie.
0486278077|1.0|I have recently begun reading all those books I \\"should\\" have read a long time ago. I started with Dorian Gray because I knew the basic premise and liked the concept. I was sooo disappointed. Really, the main story and plot could have been contained in a short story of 20 pages or less. The rest of this book is basically a vehicle for Oscar Wilde's witticisms. Quotable Quotes galore.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This was a satisfying ending to possibly the greatest series I've ever read.  It didn't disappoint on any level.  Loose ends were tied up, questions answered.  I loved every minute of it, and I'm a little sad that the ride is over.  For now...
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I'll admit my husband and I are a little late to the party for Modern Family, but since we started watching the second season we are totally hooked. I bought Season 1 so we could play catch up. This show is funny and sassy. It's got a little bit of bite and is extemely well-written. Even if your family doesn't look just like theirs, I can see a little bit of a few of my family members in Claire, Hailey, Phil, Jay and even Cameron. I think that this show really illustrates that no family is perfect and the moments that make us cringe are the moments we remember and laugh about later.
B003XT60KO|5.0|I wish every American would read this highly informative book that lays out economics in way anyone can understand.  It's actually pretty simple (or should be) and the government has complicated it in order to benefit certain groups.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I had not heard of Leonard Cohen except by name therefore made a fantastic discovery while watching him on the PBS/ I bought the DVD of the same program and it is one of my all time favorites.  He is very easy to listen to, his poetry is an powerful today as when he wrote it way back when. I learned more of him when I purchased a biography of him also. Getting cack to the DVD - the musicians on the disc are great too. Back up singers are very good and the audience was so enraptured with his manner as well.  I highly reccommend this to anyone who loves the coming together of the musicians, the singers and the poetry/
B004CAWKXE|1.0|If you like MCR for the quality of Three Cheers or Black Parade, DO NOT BUY THIS.<br /><br />If, however, you love listening to Anime intro music (think \\"Strawberry 100%\\"), or 80's pop, go for it.<br /><br />I wonder if they had the same producer as AFI's piece of crap, Crash Love?<br /><br />Maybe aliens kidnapped the real band members, and this is the government cover-up. Hey, it's as plausible as me buying their next album.<br /><br />*edit*<br /><br />Well, MCR is no more. I can't really say I am surprised. Killjoys was an unimaginative last gasp, and their impending breakup really shows.
B002RL7W9W|4.0|This was a big hit this Christmas, despite the small size.  The kids really loved the snow troopers.  I am amazed how legos have kept the star wars legacy alive in young kids who have never seen the movies.
0385341679|5.0|I like many others waited ages for this book to come out after discovering the first two in a grocery store and then the other two from amazon. The book was amazing I read for two straight days because I just could not put it down! I had to know what Mac was and Jericho too. This book is amazing and well worth the price

GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR COLLECTION IF YOU ARE A FAN.IT INCLUDES ALL OF THEIR HITS.FROM THEIR FIRST HIT TAKE ON ME,TO THEIR VERY LAST SONG BUTTERFLY,BUTTERFLY(THE LAST HURRAH).FROM 1985 TO 2010. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO REMEMBER A HA. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE YEARS OF MUSIC. YOU WILL BE MISSED!!!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This work of art is magnificent on very many levels; it stirs the imagination and satisfies the emotions, is beautiful, exciting and tender.  After I saw The Fall for the first time, I thought I had found all of its virtues, but then, when I viewed the director's comments (presented as voiceover during another full showing of the movie), I realized how much more there is to discover about it and about the performers and the director himself. I am so glad I could find it to purchase.  See it, love it, and don't skip the director's discussion.
0385341679|4.0|ShadowFever by Karen Marie Moning was so good and yet so...something. The book was action packed with twists and turns that you would never expect. If you go in thinking everything you knew was how it was then prepare for it to sucker punch you because NOTHING is as it seems. Even while you are reading it, don't believe anything until you have finished the book. The book did tie up many loose ends. Things become resolved in their own little quirky way. I devoured this book. However,when I completed it, I felt a little unsatisfied. *SPOILER* We never find out what or who Barrons REALLY is! Yes, Mac, at the end is okay with that and accepts it. I, on the other hand, felt a little cheated. Mac says she will work things out and it will be okay between her and Dani. But that also was a generic wrap up. Christopher is kind of left with an \\"oh well\\". A previous review said that Moning has contracted to do another series. I HOPE it is true. Hopefully it would clear the air with Christopher and Dani questions. *END SPOILER* All in all it was a very good book. I would highly reccommend reading it. Espcecially if you have completed the previous Highlander/Fever books.
0385341679|5.0|I went to the Shadowfever launch party in New Orleans.  I was able to get the book on Monday afternoon and had all day and night to read it before the Q&A session the next day with KMM.    I can say this was the first time in a LONG time that I couldn't put a book down.  I managed to finish all 595 pages before the Q&A and I think that was the fastest I've ever read something.    Karen does an amazing job wrapping the big things up.. while leaving some stuff with a little mystery.  You'll love it!
B001O1O71C|5.0|this book is sl hartwarming and devastating. The boy named Bruno has to go through so many tough challanges. How hard is it to move from the place you grew up at. He meets a boy who is having a miserable life trapped where you dont know if your going to get killed tommorow or next week. Crazy how someone could live like Bruno seeing people living that way and your parents not caring about them just about themselves
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Leonard Cohen was always very special, marrying Poetry and Music. This time he outdone himself, by surrounding himself with an exceptional group of talents - all who seem to be in their True Bliss - singing right from the bottom of their hearts. Very special indeed. We are glad that you are still alive and well...
B000002GA8|5.0|This is the best enhancement of classical music I know! The only others I'm aware off, also great, are King Arthur (Wakeman), Hamburger Concerto (Focus), Salisbury (Uria Heep), Sarabande (John Lord), In held Twas in I (Procol Harum).<br />Any others I should give a try?<br /><br /> Notice that my disliking of classical music is not based on the incompetence of its composers but rather on the unavailability of electric organ and guitar.<br /><br />It was Andri Giere, whom I otherwise almost had forgotten, who indroduced \\"Journey to the centre of the earth\\" into our Ancient-Greek class in 1974; also ELP's Tarkus is gratefully acknowledged. Once I'm at it, let me thank some more school buddies of 1972-1977 for exposing me to these pearls that at the time I would never have imagined to be listening in 2011 at a regular base:<br /><br />Felix Dasser for Selling England by the pound (Genesis), Renaissance (Vanilla Fudge), Crime of the Century (Supertramp), Chicago Live at Carnegie Hall 1969,<br /><br />Martin Fritsch for Hamburger Concerto (Focus),<br /><br />Ruedi Herrmann for Every good boy deserves favor (Moody Blues), Piledriver (Status Quo), Led Zeppelin II,<br /><br />Jonas Meier for Close to the Edge (Yes), Valentyne Suite (Colosseum), Time and Tide (Greenslade), Trout Mask Replica (Captain Beefheart; I love it now but didn't then).<br /><br />I myself should be congratulated for e.g. introducing Procol Harum, Queen, Frank Zappa, Rare Earth, Cockney Rebel, Doors, Robin Trower, Uria Heep, Jefferson Airplane, John Geils Band, Titanic, Cactus (in the meanwhile I got plenty more of this great band which I've come to like better than Cream).

0811875555|5.0|The Art of Tangled provides key insights into filmmaker influences from Disney productions as they pioneered new techniques in computer animation for the film Tangled. Author and Disney expert Jeff Kurtti explores not just Tangled by the entire history of 3D film animation, using interviews with artists, animators and producers and packing in the artwork that went into production, from character sketches and storyboards to color scripts. No fan of Tangled or animated film production should be without this in-depth survey.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Overview:<br /><br />This music is very exceptional. Firstly the 2 tracks for which samples are not included are:<br /><br />Track 21 Tron: Legacy (End Titles)<br />Track 22 Finale<br /><br />Rest assured, these titles are just as good, if not even better than the rest.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />What I like about this music is that there is a wonderful cross-over of Electronica music and classical music. This works and creates a wonderful techno-classical atmosphere.<br /><br />In the insert, Daft Punk thanks Hans Zimmer along with others for their generosity. Anyone who is into Movie Sound Tracks, will know that Mr Zimmer was responsible for the sound tracks for the movies: Inception and the last Sherlock Holmes movie (and many others). I am not sure what his role was, but the music on this CD is top notch.<br /><br />The Packaging:<br /><br />The packaging for this product is also exceptional. The underneth of this CD is actually black, and the top of it is printed to look like the disk used to fight with. The CD also is not packaged in the typical jewel case, but there is a cardboard cover with metallic blue printing on it.<br /><br />The booklet inside has 20 pages including the cover, and it contains some pictures from the film along with some interesting information about Daft Punk.<br /><br />This will make a nice addition to your collection!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|This fan does run very quiet and cool...I was 20C cooler than with the stock fan for my I5.    However,    I spent an entire hour installing this fan.  The included screws have a flat quarter for assembling. The screw configuration is very important for getting the fan to fit appropriately and nothing was mentioned in the installation guide.  The flat screws also gave me a lot of problems with cross threading.  I finally got this bulky fan mounted...and it sticks out 3\\" past my case lid.  So, I have to uninstall the whole deal and order a new fan...or get a new case.
0439023521|5.0|My friend gave me this book before I went on my honeymoon. I never even picked up the book until our red-eye flight back home. I never slept. No matter how tired I was. I just read and read and read. A good book for me, is one that I crave and I can't get enough of. This book is exactly like that. In fact, the entire trilogy is fantastic.    I have turned 5 other people onto this book(and series). Everyone has loved it. I don't think you can go wrong!
B00006J3WH|5.0|I received the purchase earlier than was expected which was great! The cd arrived in perfect condition, including all cd jacket inserts. It plays perfectly and overall it was a great transaction!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|Pandorum is a very underrated film. It's among the best Sci-Fi thrillers to come out recently. Great action, very scary. I highly recommend checking this movie out.
B002ZG9940|1.0|To say this movie sucked is too good for it.  The movie has no real story to it and is boring as hell.  I expected better from Clooney but he can't save this dumb sense-less movie.    This movie is a total waste of time and $0.01 is too much for it.  If you want a good movie, look elsewhere - there are lots of good ones.  Just not this one.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This is probably in the top 5 of all of my Concert CD's.  I really wasn't getting too excited about this performance until the third or fourth song when the members of the band started blending in.  A couple of major performances stood out for me.  First of all, in my mind, David Byrne is one of the top vocalists and showmen in all of music.  His enthusiasm while performing these songs was mesmerizing.  He had such great rhythm while dancing to various tracks that it kept you locked in on him most of the show.  The other highlight that really struck me was the performance by the two girls that sang background during the show.  They both had great voices and moved extremely well to every tune.  The rest of the band were more than competent on various instruments.  In short, I would highly recommend this DVD.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|i absolutely loved this book! i could not put it down and didnt want it to be over! stayed up late reading it and woke up with it still on my mind. i came to feel much empathy and deep compassion for jack. this book is a must read!

044651506X|5.0|I have read a large number of books by several mystery writers and this guy is by far my favorite. If professional literary critics say that there is a better mystery writer around, my suggestion is that they should read more books.  Plum Island certainly ranks up there with his best. He always manages to insert a bit of humor so that the reader can get a laugh in between the surprises. I suspect that there's a lot of DeMille in his hero. Even when the hero, John Corey is in more excrement than a sewer duck he always manages to come up with a one-liner.  Obviously, I thoroughly recommend this book or any other DeMille mystery for that matter.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I had heard some great reviews about the songs on this CD and I must say I really do love it myself! There are some catchy songs on here and the more you listen to it the more you love it. I especially love his Marry Me, Grenade and Talking To The Moon. A great CD to listen to for relaxing!
B001EN71DG|5.0|its been years since i watched any of the original trilogy, and when i saw the amazing deal for this boxed set, i jumped on it.  glad i did!  movies are great (could have used some behind-the-scenes featurettes, but whatevs), and i remember now why they are far superior to the new trilogy.<br />YES.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My husband and I bought this toy for our 4 month old for Christmas. Before we got this toy it was difficult to get him to spend time on his tummy, but now we just sit the snail in front of him and make it make noise. It keeps his attention for a pretty good amount of time as he tries to figure it out and makes it make noise himself. He really loves it, so of course we love it, too!
B0021L8V0M|3.0|\\"Salt\\" is satisfying if you like treadmill action and spies coming out of the sewers.  It has action and thrills, with an outrageous plot that keeps popping surprises.  Most of the crazy double crosses you can guess, but it is still fun to watch.  Angelina Jolie plays the Russian Mole CIA Agent, Evelyn Salt, with gusto.  She keeps your interest with fast-paced escapes, clever disguises and turn on a dime attack scenes.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Russian sleeper agents coming to bring down the United States.  The agents are brain-washed as orphaned children who are sent to adoptive families in the United States.  As they mature and reach responsible positions throughout the country, all come to life as evil agents with specific plans to bring down the USA.  Evelyn Salt is the only hope we have - oh my!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie was terriffic.  DiCaprio did an amazing job, as far as I am concerned he is one of the best actors of our generation.  The plot was so mind blowing and intense, but also deeply sad and sentimental.  The only critique I have is that it is so complex that my husband lost interest.  If you are like me though and love to ponder the what-ifs in life, it was wonderful.

B004HYBMR0|4.0|Pretty Little Liars is a new favorite of mine.  The writing is so good. It keeps you emotionally invested in the characters, and also on the edge of your seat trying to guess what will happen next.  Bravo to ABC for seeing the potential in this storyline and executing it so deliciously. Also, the theme song is perfect.
1595141715|5.0|I've discovered that many of the Young Adult books have a dark side to them. This book is the same. It is about suicide.<br /><br />A girl named Hannah records 13 reasons why she commits suicide on cassette tapes. Clay Jensen receives them and learns that he is one of the 13 reasons.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers - I really like the very last few pages of the book with a character named Skype (I beleive that was her name). I read this book a few weeks ago.<br /><br />I'll probably read the next book that Jay Asher writes.<br /><br />Danny Pettry<br />Author of:<br />[[ASIN:1442105739 Discover Hidden Secret Wisdom: A Recreational Therapist's System on How You Can Become Great at Anything]]
B001E45XT4|3.0|This is a good value for your money, but now 6 months down the line, it becomes apparent that these were not made to last. The sound quality is rapidly degrading and I have been forced to buy a new pair so I can have a functional mic and consistent sound. Don't get me wrong, for 6 months there were wonderful, but don't buy thinking your buying something to last 2 years.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|When I bought the album back in 1980 I remember being so excited that John and Yoko were finally back making music. What I didn't expect was that Yoko's tunes would totally outshine John's. Well, truth be told, I loved both but was so surprised at how cool Yoko's were. John's were great and loved them immediately but Yoko's were absolutely amazing! I had always thought her tunes on Sometime in NYC were great but these totally blew me away. I just don't get all the \\"hate\\" thrown at her for being an artist, conceptual or otherwise. Goddamn, listen to her. She is awesome!!!
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|This is a lackluster movie made from a mediocre screenplay. The trailer makes this look like an exciting thriller. It is neither exciting nor a thriller. It is a long boring mess that doesn't know what it wants to do. For serious Matt Damon fans only. For fans of the director Clint Eastwood class this one as \\"Fail\\".
B00243FQFA|5.0|The writers outdid themselves with the fifth season of Stargate Atlantis. The episodes are crisp, have interesting story lines, and a great end to the season, as Atlantis comes home; or, possibly, for the first time, in the Milky Way galaxy.  John was brought before a board to hear crimes Atlantis has made while in their struggle with the bad guys, a.k.a the wraith. Beats Goa'ulds to pieces, besides, a Wraith could feed on the parasite and host, what a treat.  They wriggle out of one problem, but, another crops up. One of the basic problems they had was power, and, I thought the writers missed by not having them find how to make the ZPM, having found in that massive Ancient data base how to do it, but, in their arrogant manner, not say where to find the basic parts. Every good Ancient would know anyway.  Now that the mighty city of Atlantis has come home, they will have proper facilities to download the data base into. Then, the newly powered city could again fly all over the galaxies. Alas, that will never happen. All good things come to an end.
B004GF244K|5.0|No matter what, this is a bona fide must get.  Not only is the music great, the concert hits you emotionally and brings a tear or two to your eyes.      BTW, the aspect ratio of 1.33 must be wrong - again.
B001O1O71C|4.0|This book is amazing. But they spelled things incorrectly! Once they spelled pajamas pyjamas! You should really edit a book before you publish it. But other then that I love the book! I was just looking at books and I found this one. I am very glad that I did! I am eleven years old so I may not be the best book judge. But I love this book and that is MY opinion. No one will ever change it. I love this book.
1594202842|1.0|I'm an Asian mother (not Chinese), and I was appalled by Chua's 'Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother'.    Let me tell you this. You can raise high achieving children without torturing them. I did it. It takes a lot more effort than Chua's method. If you do right way, you'll have happy children who enjoy learning, playing music, and the best of all, who love being with you. That's one of the reasons I just couldn't stomach Chua's pathetic excuses why she was so nasty to her children and her husband.     There were some funny parts in this book, but I don't think Chua intended it. Her selfish thinking was so outrageous that I had to laugh.    But the main reason why I give this book one star is not her parenting style.   This is just not a good book as a memoir.     Throughout the book, Chua kept on bragging about how great her daughters were at piano and violin. You just don't write a whole book about it. And, Chua was constantly insulting other ethnic groups. That's totally unnecessary.     I was completely sick of her by the end of the book.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I have to admit before I started watching the Vampire Diaries I had my doubts that it would capture my attention.  I was watching it with my neice one day and I got hooked.  Damon is by far my favorite character, when he gets pissed, people tend to die.  I like the buddy relationship between Rick the History teacher, Damon and Stefan's vampire weapons provider.  Season two is hands down better than season one, I like the way the characters interact with each other, and I'm never bored.  When a show ends, I'm upset that I have to wait for the next week.  When Caroline was turned into a vampire I had my doubts that she would become a major player, but I like her character so much more than the first season. I wasn't very impress with Nina Dobrey's potrayal of Elena, but she has really shown her range as an actress playing Katherine.  Katherine is one evil bitch and she will hurt, kill, or damage anyone to get her way. It's fun to watch the happenings of Mystic Falls, but I would never want to live there.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown. The price for the Kindle version was only $3.99, and it was a terrific read. My reason for the 4 star review is that the last 6-7% of the story was not very interesting to me and didn't seem particulary relevent. It was certainly relevent if you read this more interested in the \\"symbology\\" aspect of the story, but I was more interested in the characters and the action. As soon as we knew what was going to happen with the characters, he could have wrapped this up. Other than that, it was a great book to read.
0765348276|3.0|Just got done reading it and I found it an interesting and fun read.  Nothing major or mind blowing, just fun.  I agree with some of the reviews that the supporting characters, with one exception (Jane) were pretty dull, boring and interchangable.  When I would read how one of his friends died I couldn't help but wonder who that person was exactly and why I should care.<br />The battle scenese were nicely written and I do love me a good battle scene.  The ending seemed a bit rushed with a final chapter was was more \\"okay, here's what happened now, then this, then this\\" but, up to that point I was entertained.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002V1IP6C The Arwen]]

0385341679|5.0|I am going on the raw, first read impression.  KMM has neatly wrapped up all of the questions anyone ever had about the last 4 while still leaving a vague sense of wanting more.  I will not go into any detail because as Karen said, any information shared wil give something away.  All I can say is read it, read the whole series! Even if this is not your typical genre it is a fabulous retreat into another world of wonder.
B0011UF79C|2.0|Why didn't the producers of this DVD not have the Director or Actor or Cinematographer give running commentary.  No option for running commentary?!  What, you think I'm stupid and don't know what most other DVDs have?  Do we have an elitist director never saying a blessed word even during a production documentary about his own movie ever?  What's going on here?    Great movie, however again stupid DVD that also edits out the montage following the credits: who of the famous would not have been famous with the standards of the \\"Gattaca\\" world.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|--Mark Zuckenberg, the founder of Facebook about the makers of The Social Network.<br /><br />The Social Network (2010) is fast, smart, sharp, and very modern because it tells the story based on the real facts going back to the origins of social network called Facebook that started few years ago,  continues  growing every moment, and  forever has changed the way people communicate  whether we like it or not.  At the same time, the story is timeless, because it has been told many times already, that of the unpredictable and sky rocketing rise of a young genius, in this case computer prodigy, not very popular socially among his peers, who creates the comprehensive, easily accessible and the most popular and populated network of communication, which as of now includes 500 million participants all over the world and has made its creator the youngest billionaire ever. According to Kevin Spacey (yes, THE Kevin Spacey), the  film producer and owner of the rights for the book  by Ben Mezrich (\\"Bringing Down the House\\") \\"The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,\\" which is the basis for the script by Aaron Sorkin, it is \\"captivating story of betrayal, vast amounts of cash, and two friends who revolutionized the way humans connect to one another--only to have an enormous falling out and never speak again.\\"<br /><br />What made the film about birth and growing of the largest Internet social network truly remarkable are directing by David Fincher, the film's pace, and masterful editing. Seems that it moves with a speed of 100 megabytes per second, sweeps the viewers like a tornado, and throws them in a blink of eye back and forth from  the recent past when there were no Facebook yet but it was inevitably meant to happen to the present switching between two lawsuits that Mark Zuckerberg had to face. One was filed by his former best friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin, and another - by the Winklevoss twins  who claimed that Zuckerberg stole their original idea for his Facebook.  I am not sure if it is the best movie of last year but certainly one of the most inventive, coolest, and interesting,  the happy combination of intelligent and entertaining film with mass appeal. While watching,  I could not help thinking of it as of Citizen Kane of modern day - even before I found out from reading about the film that I was  not the only one who thought so.<br /><br />The cast of the young actors all did terrific job.  I've always liked Jesse Eisenberg since I saw him for the first time in the independent film Roger Dodger (2002) and I knew instantly that he would have a great future. In addition to Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield is very good as Eduardo Saverin, the best and the only friend of Mark Zuckerberg in Harvard, and co-founder of Facebook, who  later was forced to leave the company and sued  for his share  in the Facebook stocks. According to the film, the big role in the fallout between Mark and Eduardo  played Sean Parker - himself, a very remarkable personality. Parker was one  of the creators of the enormously popular ten years ago  but forbidden by  court Napster - free Peer-to-Peer file sharing of music.  Sean Parker, as played by Justin Timberlake, is very clever, charming, smooth, insightful, and totally unscrupulous, a Mephistophelian figure.  I never thought of Timberlake much as of  actor but I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. I also liked Armey Hammer who provided some comic relief in the double role of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, golden boys who belong to the circle of \\"American aristocracy\\", the members of the Harvard row-crew that  hired the fellow  undergrad, Mark Zuckerberg to create  a social network that would connect the Harvard students and let them communicate with one another on line. While working on the project, Zuckerberg took the idea to  creating the global network, and the rest is history.<br /><br />I would only suggest to a potentialviewer not to take the film as an accurate documentary. It is not. From what I've read about real Mark Zuckerberg, his persona is somewhat different from the character that Jesse Eisenberg masterfully created  in the Fincher/Sorkin's film. The main triggers  in the film that started Mark working  on the new site were frustration caused by the break up with his girlfriend and inability to join the most prestigious student clubs in Harvard.  Real Mark has had the relationship with the same girlfriend since he was 19 - before he had become the creator of Facebook. He said in the interviews that he did not care about joining the clubs, and I believe him. The worlds he has created using his talent and his computer, starting as the teenager, were more exquisite than any prestigious club but jealousy and resentment just look so good in the movie that it would be much more difficult and challenging to make a compelling movie without them,  just about someone who \\"might build something because they like building things\\". But then, we would be talking about completely different film.ilm as an accurate documentary. It is not.

B004A8ZX14|3.0|Sadly, \\"No Strings Attached\\" does not live up to it's poster or the well-edited trailer. The second poster that was released for the film is flirty, fun, and exudes control. The film is nothing like the poster - there's chemistry between the leads but the plot is full of nonsensical boy-meets-girl, girl-doesn't-want-to-get-hurt-so-rejects-boy, stereotypes. Instead of being a commentary on the reversal of gender roles in relationships, the film abides by the conventional rules.     Furthermore, the jokes are thin and, frankly, the best ones can be seen in the spectacular trailer.    Still, spending an hour and a half looking at two gorgeous people like Ashton Kutcher (who exemplifies his pretty boy image, but doesn't strain his acting muscles) and Natalie Portman (who is pitch perfect in her portrayal of a strong, sexy, yet vulnerable woman, who is as far from her Black Swan character as one can get) is hardly a bad way to pass the time.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I could hardly wait to open the package containing the BK-2 from KaBar USA. I couldn't have been more satisfied as I checked out the quality and felt the weight of this knife! I will be using this knife for bushcrafting, cooking, hunting, etc. This knife will last a lifetime and be great to hand down to future generations.
B003TVMIDO|1.0|I have to start by saying this is a review of this package of music, not John Lennon or the music- THIS PACKAGE.  So here goes- folks, do the math:  Lennon's 8 CDs sell for around $13 each, except Sometime in NYC, which goes for $19.  That's the new remastered 2010 versions right here on Amazon.  7x13=91 + 19= $110.  So right there you've got all of John's CDs INCLUDING the stripped version of Double fantasy (not included here) for $60+ less than this!  If you want the 6 \\"non album songs\\" you can pick up the new Power to the People CD for $13 which has them all except Move over Ms L (no great loss) (or the \\"John Lennon Collection\\" single CD used for pennies (which has them all).  Then, you could get \\"wonsaponatime\\" CD for $14 for a better, longer version of what the \\"bonus CD\\" here attempts to offer.  Frankly, I don't even think these \\"outtakes\\" belong in here, as this should be a box of his \\"regular releases\\".  So purchased individually you can have All OF THIS, except for a few non essentials, and you'll have the Double Fantasy stripped to boot  for $137!!  Or leave out the outtakes, and just get the regular CDS ($110) + Power to the People $14 = $124!! Not even close to the $170+ this is going for!    NOW, if this box was the original 8 albums, + a 9th CD of DF stripped, plus a 10th CD of the \\"non album songs\\" plus some other outtakes and sold for $99 I'd buy it!  I mean isn't a box set supposed to be less per CD than buying them individually!  Missed opportunity!
081297381X|3.0|I was told to buy this book and did. It is an interesting read and the author certainly thinks pretty highly of himself. He provides examples that illustrate his point, but I don't think he does enough to educate the reader on how to prevent his premise. The book can be skimmed and is interesting, but I think there are some better ways to use your time.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I absolutely love the twists and turns in this movie. Most of all how they show totally different sides of the characters! I also love the subtly incorporation of Manchester Park throughout the story. Wonderful for any Jane Austen fan!
B004DMAZQK|5.0|White Lies are a small piece of 80's sounding heaven.  I love the beat of all the songs.  The album is upbeat but with melancholy words of yearning and loss. I think this album is on par with their first album.  It is strange to me that this group isn't as big as Interpol or Arcade Fire it could be for lack of promotion in the United States.  They are promoted more in the United Kingdom.   Sadly they should be promoted more here as well.  They are one of my favortie new bands and when it comes to new music or new artists I think most of it is so-so.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|I have always been fascinated by success.  Gary V is an example of a great success story.  I picked up his book, Crush It! on my kindle app while on a family vacation recently.  I have to say that this is by far one of my favorite business and life success books of all time.  The book was inspirational, motivational and full of great practical advice.  I recommend this book to anyone looking to start a business, grow their business or advance their career.  You won't be disappointed!!  I plan to read this book often as part of my ongoing list of success tools.
0525951652|3.0|Have a kindle but decided to do hardcopy for this big boy and am glad I did.  It is an easily held and read book, didn't appreciate pages and book being gentle and easy to use until I read in another review - but it is.    My best use of the hardcopy was referring to the pre-WW1 map  - i must have been absent that week in school cuz my geography and history are sorely lacking and I needed the map to keep my armies and people in order - just to trace the armies movement, etc.    The first few pages hold a cast of characters and although it was a daunting discovery when I first opened the book, I really never had to refer back to it as the stories were easy to follow.    All in all, it didn't compare to Pillars  - it was good, but not great- challenged me in some of the politics (absent that day too, I guess) but had it all figured out pretty well at the end.  Characters were a little thin at times.   Will read the rest and hopefully get more wrapped up in them.  Anxious to see the WWII interpretation....

0307341550|5.0|Reading \\"Sharp Objects,\\" I found I didn't want to like it. I was put off by its gothic, stoic fatalism, by the strange unreliability of its narrator and main character, Camille Preaker, and by its nightmare gallery of sad, manic small-town oddballs.<br /><br />I was put off by those things, yet I could not stop reading \\"Sharp Objects,\\" because I had no idea where it might be going ... and at some point, I was dimly aware that I cared very deeply about what might happen to the strange, horrible, not-quite-hopeless people of Wind Gap, Missouri. Even as they did things that made me cringe with almost every turn of a page.<br /><br />Author Gillian Flynn, in an absolute winner of a debut novel, creates a bizarre, skewed, wonderful world of awful people who either don't really want to be awful or really aren't entirely to blame for their awfulness. It is largely a world of girls and women, but \\"Sharp Objects\\" is no chick-lit that a fan of Jennifer Weiner or even Jodi Picoult would recognize. It takes us to some casual and disturbing extremes, wrapping a serial-murder mystery in the suffocating blanket of a small town that is content to suffocate on itself.<br /><br />Camille Preaker, with one foot in the insanity and one foot out (maybe), is a blazing original of a character, screwed up on many levels but trying her damnedest not to allow the word \\"hopelessly\\" be attached to that label. Her willingness to explore the depths of her dysfunction makes her, in a way, a brilliant reporter, more so than most ... because, how can we tell the truth about the ugliness of the world if we cannot tell the ugly truth about ourselves first?<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd want to read \\"Sharp Objects\\" twice. But I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to suggest that you read it once. Especially if you've been lulled into complacency by formula murder-mystery stories. This novel is a necessary slap across the face of complacency.
B000022TSY|3.0|I remember being blown away by this movie when it first came out in 1969. Just the bikers in the final scene, especially, left me breathless. I remember leaving the theater feeling depressed because the conflict between the hippy bikers and the rednecks who finally shoot them dead seemed so emblematic of the bigger divide in society then between the straights and the hippies. Of course, I was only 16 then. What did I know? Today, this film plays a little differently. You have to look at it in its own context. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculous. And there is really no plot, to speak of. The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music. The New Orleans cemetery scene is the weakest section. It was shot out of context from the rest of the film, and was something done first as a way for the filmmakers to try to get some money to make this movie. Dennis Hopper was a Hollywood pariah at the time. No one wanted to work with him because of his crazed drugging and drinking. Jack Nicholson was largely unknown, then a star of many obscure B-movies. Peter Fonda was the big man then, ironic because today he is the most forgotten of the three, never having made much in the way of other hit movies. See this as a piece of history, and maybe even entertainment, if you are nostalgic for the 60s.

B003EI2EH2|2.0|I purchased this book and studied it extensively and my husband and I started practicing the slow carb diet four weeks ago.  My husband is about 230 lb and I am about 125 lb and we're relatively active.  We've been eating nothing but protein, veggies and beans for four weeks and have not experienced any rapid fat loss or consistent changes in our measurements.  If anything, we've been yo-yo'ing, losing one week only to gain it back the next week.  VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS DIET!!!  I would say that it is not a one-size fits all approach.  May not work for you.

0613924894|5.0|This book was given to my daughter at birth and I have read it over and over to her. She loves interacting with all the pages. I have brought it on all of our trips with us. I never realized how much it meant to her until we had to move. She carries this book everywhere with her and will sit and do the pages by herself for a very long time. I have to get another one because she has simply worn it out. She is 9 months old now and still loves it! Yes the flowers stink a little but it still has the scent for her to smell. It is the greatest gift I received for the birth of my daughter.

B003EYVXYG|4.0|Okay I have seen the film and I have read all of the folks attacking George Romero and all I can say is \\"what is the matter with you people?\\" It was a good solid horror movie. Interesting with good characters and the acting was above average. Regarding the CGI effects, I felt that two of them were not that good (the heads on the spikes and the fellows head being completely blown off) but they were not that bad and certainly did little to take away from the overall film. Too many individuals,I believe, are upset that this isn't Dawn of the Dead (1978) and I don't believe this film was as good as Dawn of the Dead (which I consider to be the best horror film ever made) but that does not mean this is not a good film. That would be like attacking every film that Martin Scorsese makes and complaining that it wasn't Taxi Driver. The film had a very professional look, beautifully photographed and sure didn't seem like a movie that was made for 4 million dollars. I am dying for some studio to give Romero a 100 million dollars and letting him make the epic living dead movie of all time (it could happen). In the mean time I watch a lot of horror films and most of them are very poorly done and not very entertaining (and I am including a lot of big budget major Hollywood films). This was a good, solid zombie film, way better than most films out there.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is the first blu-ray movie i've bought and I was skeptical, but the small additonal cost was completely worth it. Colors and sounds are simply amazing. For a visually dymanic movie such as Avatar I definately recommend blu-ray but if the movie was just a comedy or romance I don't think i'd bother personally.   Some other reviewers mentioned that you've got to change disks halfway through with this edition of Avatar - you don't. Even the longest edition is one disk. I haven't looked at the other two disks yet.

B003UBTX72|1.0|Sorry, I expected more from Keith.  This was very hard to get through.  Long, winded, scattered thoughts and more information about being a junkie than I care to read about.  The last couple of chapters were choppy and poorly written.  It was like Keith became bored with the whole book idea and just couldn't wait to get it completed. Would have liked to hear more about his early life and current family life.  I guess since I'm not a musician a lot of the information was way over my head.  If you are a musician you would probably love this book.  The book should have been named Musician by Keith Richards.

I feel totally confidant in getting real results now and my motivation is more than it's ever been!  Gosh I sure wish I had purchased this book sooner!   So far it's worth every penny and more!  A must for anyone who thinks they are not able to change their body or lack the motivation.

I'm so glad I did i've lost 7 pounds in one week! yeah about a pound a day! A POUND A DAY! I'm so excited.    This book may not work for everyone but it sure has worked for me. You don't need to read the entire book just the sections that pertain to your goals. I just read the first few chapters to get started and then \\"the Slow carb diet I\\",\\" Slow Carb diet II\\" and \\"the perfect posterior\\". I bought a kettle bell and have been doing the kettle bell swings, flying dogs and glute activations on MWF. And now a week later I no longer need to do the \\"fat girl hop\\" to get in my jeans!

0131479415|5.0|The book is exceptionally well written. People have said that a book about anything 'Agile' should be thin - well this one is - There are about 24 chapters and each one is no more than easily digestible 20-30 pages for a quick 'agile' read. However, that does make it about 300 pages of content. But here are the 'Great' things about the book:<br /><br />- Well written and a light read with real pearls of wisdom<br />- Well explained concepts with examples<br />- Good primer on Estimation - separating 'duration' from the size and showing how/why it really matters in the long run (of the project)<br />- Explaining when to estimate and a good 'tutorial' on planning poker and Kano Analysis for prioritizing features/desirability.<br />- Throws light on the 'Financial Prioritization' - rubbishing the claim that features in agile teams are prioritized as per the whims and fancies of the developers.<br />- Break downs about planning at multiple levels and what details go in them<br />- Monitoring and communicating plans - the 'how' and 'what' to do<br /><br />I keep referring to the book - because it's really NOT about planning & estimating 'agile projects' - it's about how to be agile with the planning/estimating activity itself. You could use a lot of ideas (especially Kano Analysis, Planning Poker etc.,) and augment it with the approach in your organization (or your own planning exercise) to help communicate the plans/ideas more effectively.<br /><br />Do keep in mind, however - this is NOT a silver bullet that'd end the planning woes encountered in today's software development projects. The case study in the end is too idealistic where everybody is just 'willing' to participate and do it perfectly in lock step synchrony! (It's really difficult to find such software developers in the real world). However, the intent of the case study is to elucidate the concepts covered in the book and hence is a good summary of the ideas presented.<br /><br />There is nothing in the book that says what to do if the client doesn't know what he/she wants? IKIWISI = I'll know it when I'll see it - It doesn't cover anything about prototyping to get the requirements/user stories - it probably assumes that you can get them elicited with ease and moves on from there. In my opinion/experience there is a great deal of concurrency/backtracking with the initial prototyping and eliciting the user stories - an iterative exercise. Once you do those you are probably a bit better off with being able to 'guestimate' the story points.<br /><br />Kano Analysis has known to be around for quite a while and I was aware of it's use in KJ analysis (VOC+ KJ + Kano + Conjoint analysis that is part of the 6-sigma process) - however, it was a refreshing thought to be useful for just about every software product and it could be done without much overhead (actually the overhead is there, however, if the planning is done as a team, it'd be lighter :) Creating the questionnaire for Kano analysis itself takes some time/effort - but is easier once the stories are there. But 'shortening' it to be an 'agile' questionnaire DOES take time/effort. More so based on the feedback you get you may want to update it!

B0000TB01Y|4.0|After seeing Wicked, the musical, live, in San Francisco, my blood was pumping. It was hard to hold me back from trying to buy anything \\"Wicked\\". This soundtrack is nice, but unfortunately it sounds too commercial to me and lack the spirit from the live performance.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|Hats off to the director and Ryan Reynolds, who I think deserved to be nominated this awards season. This is one of the most tense and suspenseful thrillers I have ever seen.

B000FSME1A|5.0|Apocalypse Now directed by Francis Ford Coppola reminds us to do the most important task, that is to take the long difficult journey inward. Capt. Willard cannot function outside of war, so he is sent into the heart of Vietnam to deal with a rogue Colonel named Kurtz. This mission takes Willard through many phases of the war where he discovers more about himself. In the end Willard answers the ultimate question, how is he going to be while on earth.<br /><br />  What if we all saw our lives as a journey to figure out what principles we are going to stand for in our lives. Our lives would be well spent. Too many people coast through life satisfied with their mediocrity. The great accomplishment of so many is to work at jobs that are killing them long enough to receive a pension. Once they reach the point of retirement, beaten down physically and mentally, the pensioners spend their time watching television and buying things. The  Pensioners should watch Apocalypse Now while they are plopped down in front of their televisions, at least then they will be exercising their minds.<br /><br />  One scene in Apocalypse Now shows Willard at a bridge that the Vietnamese and American soldiers are fighting for. Willard finds these African - American soldier on the front lines. He asks them where is your commanding officer. One of the soldiers answers ain't you our commanding officer.<br /><br />  This scene makes me wonder what is happening on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been watching as well as listening to alternative media and according to them, the picture is not nice at all. On the bases corporations are over charging soldiers for services. On the battle field American soldiers do not know who is in charge of which village, town or province that sits away from their base of command. Sometimes American soldiers are guarding poppy fields used to make heroine that makes it back to their neighborhoods here in the states to destroy their neighbors. Bombs are every where. The child that our soldiers share candy with today could plant an explosive devise next week. Meanwhile we are no safer here in the states because the money spent on the war is draining our economy. This drain is causing enough stress that we are committing violent acts on each other for money, or a sense of security. I wonder why we keep allowing leaders to kill our family members for the sakes of their own egos.d that our soldiers share candy with today could plant an explosive devise next week.

B00402FGEE|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet.  I am a huge Sci-FI fan.  I love SG1, and even better SG Atlantis.  When SGU first came out, I could not for the life of me follow the story line or plot from show to show.  If I missed one show, I was sort of lost.  Initially I was disappointed with SGU because Atlantis was so fun to watch, easy to watch and like.  However, I must say buying this series on Blu-Ray was one of the best decisions I have done as of late.  SGU is by far the BEST of the SG series in terms of drama, acting, and story line.  Some SG fans will not like SGU.  It is not for younger crowds who like monsters, action.  SGU is geared toward the thinking adult.  Refreshing really.  SGU was cancelled after only two seasons.  I blame Sy-FI channel and programming.  There is rumor that the producers of SGU will in some form continue the series plot line.  This may be in a form of movies to provide closure or maybe web shows or worse, comic book e-book.  If you are a fan of Battle Star Galactica, then you will likely LOVE SGU.  I only wish the series lasted longer.  Maybe they will continue on Showtime or premium channels.  One can only hope.

0634049011|5.0|Some time ago, I developed the bad habit of learning pieces by memorizing measures note by note.<br />Learning new pieces became a huge, arduous task which made playing frustrating instead of joyful.<br />I spent a lot of time wishing I could play new pieces freely, and improvise by actually using the little bit of music theory I know instead of the guesswork I rely on.<br />I just finally wanted to know what I was doing.<br /><br />So, I bought the book.  After a month of picking the book up, learning stuff, applying, and then putting it down...I'm really just blown away.<br />Intuitively,  I knew there were some patterns on the fretboard.  But, I had no idea how deeply they went or how they connected with theory.<br />My site-reading has improved already, it's so much easier to learn new pieces. I'm hoping improvisation will come with more work!<br /><br />If you get the book, and put in a little work, you will be happy.<br />I'll agree with the rest of the reviewers -- the book is pretty awesome.
B0002ADXYI|5.0|I first listened to Uriah Heep's first album, known to us in the States only as the \\"first\\" album, back in 1972 while I was still in high school.  Loved it then and after all these years it still sounds terrific!!  This CD has 8 bonus tracks mostly of previously unreleased material.  The sound is great and very clean... last time I heard this album was sometime in the mid-70's during my college days. It certainly sounds like the early seventies, but then most of the music from that time is still relevant and sounds amazing, which is why I gave it 5 stars!  I also got their second album \\"Salisbury\\" and love it also!  Lots of photos and info in the booklet... they provide the cover art from both the UK and the U.S. releases which I thought was very cool.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I just ordered another one of these (the one with a 4gb card) as I lost my last one.    I use it as a small ultra-portable flash drive, and can also use it as a card reader, but for the most part I keep the same card in.    After 8 months and being washed in that little pocket in my jeans (the small pocket-in-a-pocket) a staggering THREE times, it was still doing just fine. Until I lost it. I suppose the lucky finder is happy with it now, or it got thrown away by some hotel maid. Either way, time for a new one.    The appeal of this item to me, primarily, is the size. It will get lost easier, but it looks amazing and people also ask about it when I use it. I mean, this thing is small.
B0009AM5I6|4.0|After Anna Moffo, Angela Gheorghiu is one cold and regal Violetta.  The contrast is jarring.  This is a good production but visually too minimalist for me.  Solti and the orchestra acquit themselves brilliantly.  But Ms. Gheorghiu is so formal and regal, and so cold, that I almost wish I had not bought this DVD, even with the added attraction of the highlights CD. Alfredo is superb, with a resonant voice; Ms. Gheorghiu also has a strong and accurate instrument. The sound overall is very good. But I am spoiled by  Anna Moffo. She is so feminine and spontaneous, unaffected and passionate.  She could be Violetta - she simply does not seem to be acting.  Ms. Gheorghiu, by contrast, is definitely playing a role in an opera. She lacks the emotional authenticity and vulnerability of Ms. Moffo.  As she begins to sing \\"Sempre libera, it sounds like she spits out the words, as if she were angry. It's puzzling. But Ms. Moffo sings her heart out, and she has won mine.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Loved this show when I was younger. I was a little worried about buying it though, Has it stood the test of time or will it be cheesy. It stood well, Now I just need to get the rest of the seasons. Oh ya the Torino still looks awesome as ever!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. is widely recognized as one of the greatest Pixar films ever made, and it's there are several reasons why. First, the premise of everyday monsters actually trying their best to scare human kids in order to raise their economy is something that is quite amusing. Kids and adults alike love the plot because it's very inventive. Also, the characters (especially Sully, Mike, and little Boo) are really likable, while the animation is spectacular and extraordinarily detailed. The effective humor is appropriate for all ages, so there's no need to feel very politically correct about this one.<br /><br />I may not be one of the biggest Pixar fans in the world, but I know a good movie when I see one. And Monsters Inc. is a GREAT movie. I fully recommend it to kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, even pets.<br /><br />Grade: 8.7/10
142311339X|4.0|This definitely was the first of a series. The story seemed slightly drawn out to serve more as a single episode in a three part miniseries rather than a stand alone book.<br /><br />I was very excited to read this new installment in the Greek mythology series of books by Rick Riordan. I found it very entertaining, but I found the shifting points of view to be a bit distracting. Also, it seemed to remove some of the character development as there almost wasn't enough time with any of the three main characters to truly connect with them. It probably didn't help that I found some of the new characters to not be as interesting as others either. Leo appeared to be the most developed and well-rounded of the bunch, and I found myself sometimes dreading the stereotypical ramblings of a teenage girl when in Piper's P.O.V.<br /><br />On the positive, I found the integration of the Roman versions of the gods to be quite interesting and am looking forward to see what happens when the two worlds meet. I'm interested in where the story is going, definitely a \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" vibe developing, and I'm hoping to seeing more of Percy and Annabeth (which was alluded to in the book).<br /><br />All in all, this was another great entertaining story in Riordan's mythological settings. Definitely worth a read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|January 21st, 2011<br /><br />Yes, that's right. There is only one track I don't feel and that's \\"Fitter Happier\\" because it's not even music. It's a guy talking in a really weird voice. So I don't really count that. But the rest of the tracks I like at least a little. Most of them I like a lot. I can listen to this back to forth (since I deleted \\"Fitter Happier\\") and front to back without skipping tracks because it just flows.<br /><br />There is hardly anything I could say that hasn't been said before from all of the in-betweens to the high highs, to the low lows, but I really adore the tracks \\"Subterranean Space Alien\\", \\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\" and \\"Electioneering\\". I also believe that \\"Karma Police\\"'s bridge is extremely strong where Yorke's vocal runs are exceptionally cool.<br /><br />The track that shines brightest to me however is \\"Lucky\\". It starts kinda quiet like Exit Music (For a Film) in the verses, but then bursts with a cool, relaxing energy during the chorus which brings on a neat, melodic tone. I enjoy it heavily and it beats out \\"Subterranean\\" as my favorite new track.<br /><br />All in all, the scoring doesn't quite add up to 4.5 stars if you were to see my ratings on iTunes but I'm giving it that score because of the album's cohesive, refreshing vibe.<br /><br />Kudos, Radiohead for making me a fan of this album and for making something so classic and fresh in the year of '97. I've only heard 3 of their albums in full ([[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]], [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] and [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail to the Thief]]). [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] was pretty cool but [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail to the Thief]] felt quite uninspired and very unexciting. Didn't really like that album. There is no doubt in my mind that this is Radiohead's best, but I just might have to check out others like [[ASIN:B000YXMMAE In Rainbows]].<br /><br />\\"A-\\", 4.5 stars (or a 9/10).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Lucky\\"<br />\\"Subterranean Space Alien\\"<br />\\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\"<br />\\"Electioneering\\" &<br />\\"Karma Police\\"<br /><br />SKIP:<br />\\"Fitter Happier\\"ier\\"

B004132HZS|5.0|I really really  enjoyed these episodes. The acting is great and Holmes and Watson have a great chemistry.  The idea of making them contemporary figures is genius. Buy this series. I got it as a gift and I have shared them with several people.
030746363X|5.0|I've enjoyed this book very much and not just because of all the useful advice but especially for it's entertainment value. It's my new Bible.
B001IFZL50|5.0|My son is a Marine and has watched all the war movies. He said this was by far the best ever made. So good that while training in CA, his SSgt. made the whole unit watch it ! If anyone wants to see what it was like for a recon unit in Iraq, get this series. It's still Hollywood remember but very well done and worth buying !
B000068CNX|5.0|Excellent Product..needed to know quality of productand know if it was coming from a reliable source.  The end!                                        \\\\
B000H6SXMY|5.0|WELL I am big fan of FRIENDS.     love the special pack with all picture of the main characters and its easy to deal with pictures while u r putting the disk back from the pile u were watching.      Simply excellent job on dvd's  new look !!!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Terrific book. If i tried to predict the outcome... I would be wrong. The People who hate this book are shmucks. It seemed to cover up the grim topic with darkly consoling humor. Destined to become a classic sitting on my shelf next to the book thief by Markus Zusak another beutifally written story intended to draw the reader in from the title. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this film! The characters are fantastically written and played. The story is wonderful, including social issues, multiple story lines and plot depth  without being overly romantic or over-the-top. Daniela Denby-Ashe is brilliant as Margaret Hale the spunky southern girl who always has an opinion. While kind and generous she isn't remotely concerned with how her opinion, once voiced, will be taken by others. Richard Armitage as the no-nonsense, hard nosed, northern tradesman John Thornton is a great antagonist.  I definitely recommend this miniseries for fans of the BBC, Jane Austen, \\"boy meets girl, boy and girl disagree, boy loves girl, girl hates boy, girl changes her mind\\" scenarios and anyone who enjoys romantic dramas with greater plots than just a great love story.
B003WTE886|4.0|Compared to her previous release, Fearless, Speak Now is a showcase of Taylor Swift's continuing growth. Songs like \\"Dear John\\" and the hit \\"Back to December\\" offer lyrical honesty that is rare even among many of the most seasoned performers. She also exhibits a stronger (often sarcastic) sense of humor than before, as on \\"Mean,\\" \\"Better Than Revenge,\\" and the title track. This is a slower, more subdued effort for Taylor, but \\"Mine\\" and \\"Sparks Fly\\" give the album an uptempo start with her trademark county-pop style. Overall, this is the most substantial release of her career, despite its share of filler tracks. It's hard to criticize an album that finds its artist transitioning into adulthood so smoothly and honestly. 4 Stars.
B004HAG40O|5.0|I've enjoyed all of their albums - but in varying degrees. I've seen them live - and they are some of the best musicians going - very exciting shows - no matter what they played. Its funny though - I started getting a bit tired of their \\"concept albums\\", and kept longing for some of their earlier stuff, and also really enjoyed going way back to Tarkio. I kept thinking \\"If they could do more of the kind of song - segues like \\"The Engine Driver\\" and \\"On The Bus Mall\\", or get back to the basics like \\"Grace Cathedral Hill\\", \\"California One / Youth and Beauty Brigade\\", and combine that with the Tarkio songs - I thought that that would keep the fans interested.    I like the Decemberists best when they take out every instrument that they all can play (and so, so well), combine it with just enough - but not too much of the over the top lyrics and vocals, and it would be perfect. I wanted to hear more pedal steel too - when I heard a couple of songs live that featured pedal steel it blew me away. So well done! Its still rock - not \\"alt-country\\" IMHO.    They have done exactly what I had been hoping for. And adding Peter Buck and Gillian Welch on this album is genius. Its seems like The Decemberists will continue to challenge the audience as they traverse the many roads they seem to be able to travel on.

Not suggested material around dates, chicks in general or anyone with strong religious convictions...

B0043UCVQY|4.0|Where in the hell was I? Though a big True Blood fan, I saw the previews on Starz and thought its a ill interpret cheesy version of 300 as a series.  Boy was I wrong!!!! I love the storyline, the period costuming is pretty accurate (slaves wore little to nothing rags and hand me downs),an actual depiction of different nationalities and creeds in those days, sex,Lucy Lawless, sex, dude from the Mummy movies (pretty hardcore role)and sex. I'm so glad my buddy told  me  about this series. Man, even the dialog is off tha chain. Men were Men in that time period, where are they now?? Dead!!! But great show, good looking cast (bodies too!), simple and honest storyline. I give it a 4 cuz of the blood, yeah kinda fakish but the overall fighting and loincloths (little to none) are the greatest!! Starz outdid themselves!!!
0385333846|1.0|How this book became a classic is beyond me. Insipid and dull with a disjointed story line. The final straw was the 100th repitition of the very annoying \\"so it goes\\" phrase the author is compelled to use after every death. Stopped reading the book about halfway into it just to avoid another iteration. I guess one had to have grown up in the LSD era to appreciate this rambling and bizaar book.
0385341679|5.0|When my friend recommended the Highlander series I had dismissed it, until a few years later when I accidentally stumbled upon the Fever series in early December. What a delight it was to discover a gem of a series. No book has ever excited me as much as these books and I've read everything from J.R Ward to Sherrilyn Kenyon to Lora Leigh and in between. Mac is unlike any other character you've met, her relationship with Barron's is unique, heartbreaking and enviable. As the release date crawled closer and closer I was filled with apprehension, dubious of how Karen Marie Moning would give us the happy ending we all desperately craved. Now I just wish I had a little more faith, needless to say this book went beyond my every expectation.

B002WTC8RA|5.0|I loved this book from the first page.  I thought the letters format would be annoying but it really wasn't.  I wanted it never to end.  My grandmother was from Guernsey so I went there many times visiting family and, of course, now I want to go back again.  Beautiful.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved it in the theaters, and now love the DVD. It arrived on time and I have watched it repeatedly since!
0525951652|5.0|As a history buff I loved every page of this book. The book uses the background of the WW I scenario to despict how the relations of class and power inside societies changed and how this huge event affected it.   Unlike most reviewers, I don't think the characters were shallow or underdeveloped. In my opinion, they are there to serve the story, not the opposite. I mean, the great ammount of coincidences are here in the book to help put the reader into the events. Is like TITANIC, where the Ship was there to serve as a background, but in the end stole the show, the WWI is just to big to be overshadowed by mere ficticious characters.   That's another to look at it too. Imagine that this story was possible, then imagine that someone chose to tell this particular tale. Voilá, there you have. Improbability problem solved.     The way Follet depicts the elite and poor classes is a lit bit cliché, but their stupidity is well documented in history books. The battle of Somme speaks for itself... So how can one argue against facts? And I think he does a good job at showing how century old certainties were shattered, and how society changed. The Russian revolution is awesome too, showing how the original idea was corrupted in the beggining and how helpless is to fight human nature.    All in all, I highly recommend it. It is on my personal list of fastest read books.
0060558121|5.0|American Gods by Neil Gaiman... not really read it but listened to the audio book and it was AMAZING. Not just the narration, which is incredible, but the story. Forgotten gods and deities from every culture and religion are living \\"undercover\\" all across the States. They are tired of being substituted and not venerated so they decide to make a revolution. The conducting line is Shadow, a quiet, lonely man who is literally \\"offered a job he can't refuse\\" by a mysterious guy called Wednesday. Definitely,  a turning point in my life as a writer and as a person.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|One of the best shows ever, you will love watching this DVD over and over. The sound and imagery is AMAZING.
0743200799|4.0|Kranz is a good example of leadership. He has the discipline and focus in his blood.<br /><br />He provides the readers all details of space programs as risks, apprehension, disapointments and success envolved on this business. He's a kind of leader that everyone would like to have in their team.<br /><br />In fact, his book reflects everything that happened on the American Space Program.
0451205766|5.0|I bought this book even though I read it a few years ago and just finished it for the second time.  It is exellent.  Deep, clever, with plenty of lingo and inside info on the worlds of Mafia, hollywood and Las Vegas.  Great for anyone who liked either the movie or anything else by Mario Puzo.  A must, in my book, for anybody who likes reading.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|You ever sit down to watch a film, mainly because someone has raved a particular performance and you really want to see what all the hype was about, only to find yourself scratching your head over that said performance, wondering how it is that anyone found it `rave-worthy'?  You're sitting there staring at the screen waiting for that moment when it all comes together, you know...that `ah ha' moment, but the movie is nearly over and you still haven't seen it yet.  You're just about to give up all hope and then it happens.  You're awestruck but what you're witnessing, and suddenly it all makes sense and you realize just how GENIUS the performance was from start to finish.<br /><br />I had one of those this year.<br /><br />With Oscar nominations due to be announce next week, I've given a lot of thought to performances that are NOT going to be nominated but really should.  Colin Farrell's subtle yet moving work in `Ondine', Kirsten Dunst's stunning work in the train-wreck of a movie `All Good Things', JULIANNE MOORE IN `THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT'...and right up there is a brilliantly crafted performance by Mr. Oscarless himself; Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />`Shutter Island', the film, is a little uneven for me to completely rave.  It has its moments, and when Scorsese does it right he nearly nails it, but the films textures are a tad mismatched for me to buy it completely.  The whole noir vibe seems to overlap the horror aspects of the film without meeting them for a full mesh; and the films overall construction is far too revealing to be fully effective (those flashback sequences were just a total mess).  I had previously read the novel, and so I knew the ending (which is pretty clich&eacute;d, if you ask me) but the film doesn't try and shield you from the truth at all.  It basically hits you over the head with the eventualities which take away from the sting.<br /><br />That said; it is within that ending that Leonardo DiCaprio does something remarkable.<br /><br />Throughout most of the film I found Leonardo to be serviceable at best; but to be honest I kind of leaned towards `this performance is downright bad'.  He was a poor mans Humphrey Bogart and it showed.  His accent work was a tad spotty (no where near as consistent as in `The Departed' yet no where near as dreadful as in `Blood Diamond') but overall he just came across like a bad actor.  His reactions to situations played too heavily on the `amateurish' side of things.  You could see right through him.  He seemed so out of place.  As the film continued to delude into preposterous scenarios (it is pretty faithful to the novel, which was also too obvious for its own good), DiCaprio continued to strip away any credibility to his character.  Granted, I knew the eventual outcome and so maybe that's why DiCaprio was so `obvious' to me, but it still bothered me.<br /><br />And then there was that moment, in the lighthouse, where Teddy's world came crashing down.<br /><br />In a gutting sequence of raw human abandonment, Leonardo transforms Teddy into Andrew and delivers enough shocking reality to the screen to mask the fact that we saw this coming a mile (two miles even) away.  Yes, the shtick is gone; the scared, confused man pretending to be something he's not is thrown completely out the window and instead we have replaced him with a man very much inside his own private torment.  The anguish on his face as the falsified tremors start to take on a more honest tone is ever reaching.  And then comes the dreaded flashback that has been hinted at from the moment the film started, when the `truth' is revealed.  In that moment, DiCaprio `goes there' in every sense of the word.  His gut reactions are pure and understandable.  His complete collapse is everything it needed to be to sell the moment.<br /><br />His sobbing mirrored mine, so I knew it was legit.<br /><br />And here is the most remarkable part of all.  As I watched him completely flip his character and the way he was approaching him it shed so much light on the character he had created, the character that Andrew had created.  Every moment of the film where I felt Leonardo was phoning it in or where I felt he was in over his head were now moments where I felt he was, without question, flawless.<br /><br />He built a character within a character within a character; take that `Inception'.<br /><br />In the end, I wish I could pimp this out for the Oscar this year, but my opinion carried no weight.  If DiCaprio could just pull out a surprise nomination; oh how wonderful that would be.  What he accomplished here was no easy task, for his character shifts create tonal shifts in the entire film.  He controls where this film goes, for the better.  He understands that only he can elevate this film, and he does it with an ease that is undeniable.<br /><br />\\"So, what's our next move?\\"pproaching him it shed so much light on the character he had created, the character that Andrew had created.

B002VECM72|5.0|This Blue Ray DVD was so clear.  It was a great DVD. I really enjoyed Sandra in this one.  This is a great one for your collection of DVDs and safe for the entire family to view.
1594202842|2.0|This book is approx 3-hour read which, for me, involved a lot of teeth gnashing and exasperation. I found the parenting methods in this book to be very disturbing, and I fail to believe that this book is a broad representation of Chinese moms.  It's great that her two girls far exceeded the abilities of their peers, but it's to be expected if [1] mom is constantly yelling, screaming, threatening, and manipulating while the kids are virtually imprisoned in the home: [2] both parents are ivy-league grads/professionals, who can afford instruments, tutors, special training, nannies, etc.<br /><br />Although I see (from a note on the front cover) that the intention of the book is to provide one mom's memoirs, it's my opinion that this is a study in extreme vicariousness with strong prejudicial overtones. This woman who *easily* resorts to histrionics finds her 'success' thru her children and is oblivious to the discomfort of her victimized children as well as anyone within earshot. As if the vocal pitch wasn't enough, she throws in insults (calling them garbage, fat, lazy, stupid, etc), and sets each girl up to compete against each other, while rationalizing that all this pulls the true worth from her children.<br /><br />The author shares her tendency to view all aspects of life as competitive ventures (even though she, herself, does not handle well the pressure of competition), which is imposed on the children (despite husband's behind-the-scenes protests). We see, from reading this book, that her childrens achievement in attaining straight A's, mastering Mandarin, playing Carnegie Hall as a teenager, achieving Juilliard recognition as a pre-teen...which are all in keeping with mom's high standards...STILL isn't good enough. The yelling, screaming, and pushing persists on and on. The reader should try to Imagine being a child, trying to practice something as difficult as a series of Chopin etudes (the concentration, dexterity, musicality is difficult for accomplished adults!), while the mom (who cannot play a note herself) is screeching commands throughout entire practice sessions....year after year after year.<br /><br />The tendency to reduce 'western' and 'american' practices to mediocrity (at every turn) was difficult to read and understand...especially in view of the fact that us westerners are most likely the primary audience for this book. If the book has to be defended by some of its readers for 'intention,' then it has missed its mark.<br /><br />A FEW of the opinion-moment phrases that troubled me:<br />-interest in 'crafts' leads nowhere<br />-playing drums leads to drugs<br />-drawing 'battle lines' with her daughter<br />-people who believe in astrology have serious problems<br />-tennis is respectable; it's not like bowling<br />-...ended up at a mediocre Italian restaurant because [husband] forgot to make reservations.  In this same story, the hand-made b'day cards were rejected because they weren't good enough. The girls were ordered to re-do them.<br /><br />Hats off, though, to her daughters for surviving and thriving despite their venomous, harpy 'Tiger' mom. It's my sincere wish that they will find their own true heart's delights, continue to be successful on their own terms (break the bamboo ceiling), and maybe eventually write their own books to let us know how they're doing.<br /><br />I gave this book two stars because it's an interesting read, but I think the 'intention' of the book is presented as an afterthought, as an attempt to modify the overt criticism of 'american' ways.the mom (who cannot play a note herself) is screeching commands throughout entire practice sessions....year after year after year.

B0006J28BO|5.0|I adore Studio Ghibli and Hiyao Miyazaki. The story lines that they create have a deep plot line with addicting characters and artful drawings of landscape and character concept. I love this movie because it's cute but you don't have to be 5 years old to understand it or enjoy it. His movies are definitely for everyone and I can't help but have them stuck in my head for long after I have watched them. You must buy this movie along with any and all Studio Ghibli and Hiyao Miyazaki produced and created films. Buy this and enjoy another masterpiece.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Wow, was this ever good.  Never have I ever been so enraptured with a book series.  The final book in the Fever Series, Shadowfever, was beyond my expectations.  If I could give this book ten stars I would.  I could not put this down.  There were so many twists and turns.  I was on an emotional rollercoaster reading this.      This is so hard to review without giving anything away, so I will say only this.  Shadowfever was beyond incredible.  It was so worth the extremely long wait and so many questions are answered.  You will never believe who Cruce is. You will be blown away by who killed Alina.  You will be shocked at what happened to Christian.  You will be amazed by who Mac truly is.  You will be EXTREMELY happy with who Mac has her HEA with.      It's a great book.  The whole series has been one big hanging by the edge of your seat thrill ride.  I loved it!

0439023513|3.0|I was disappointed, no, more like saddened by the events in Mockingjay. So, here's the thing. Katniss, the girl on fire, is now the face of a revolution. But, like most revolutions, death and misery surround all parties involved. We are introduced to District 13 and several new characters and thrown into this war raging throughout Panem.<br />The Ending isn't really much of one, left me sad and broken. With the first book, I was so eager to get into the next, by the end of this book, I wondered if I regretted reading it. To fully illistrate my points, I will use a normal PROS and CONS tableT<br /><br />PROS:<br />Continues and finishes the story we have all fallen in love with<br />We get out of District 12, The Capital, and the Arena, and get to see more of Panem<br />Engaging, keeps you wanting to read<br /><br />CONS:<br />Death - Yes, I get it, the books are about a Death Tournament, but honestly, so much?? its quite depressing<br />The deaths are VERY Grusome. Not, \\"and she was stabbed,\\" more like, \\"she had her head ripped off with a terrible ripping sound like paper and blood splattered everywhere in a red fountain from her now headless body.\\"<br />Most of the New Characters aren't very likable, and many returning characters become less likeable<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />PROS:<br />Katniss gets her happy(?) ending, or, at least AN ending<br />The evil Capital is overthrown<br />Many unlikeable characters die<br /><br />CONS:<br />The last few people you like DIE<br />It just kinda ends, and not very easy to follow either<br /><br />Overall, Ehh...
B004DMAZQK|5.0|I had never heard of White Lies before right around the beginning of December of this past year.  I was listening to a local college radio station and \\"Bigger Than Us\\" was playing.  I had no clue who it was so I called the station and asked.  When I looked them up and saw the album this song was from wasn't coming out for over a month, I knew I had to go back and listen to some of their past work.    Boy, am I glad I did.    I picked up \\"To Lose My Life ...\\" and was hooked after the first play through.  It was dark, warm, melodic, and kept me fully interested from the first note to the last.    Needless to say, when \\"Ritual\\" was released I ran right out and got it.  I was satisfied after the first listen and it seemed to only get better with each additional play through.  My wife said, \\"They sound a little like The Killers\\".    I find it very refreshing to get a record like this in a time when 36 of the \\"Top 40\\" are rap/hip-hop/r&b/whatever-they-call-it.  I'm glad I was listening to that station that day or I would have never discovered White Lies.    Listen to some samples and hear for yourselves.  It's just good stuff.
0439023491|4.0|The Hunger Games did what I think most books should do, be a complete story that could end there and be full, but have the ability to have a sequel/trilogy/series follow. Catching Fire did what most sequels should do, expand the story of the first and delve deeper into the world and characters while introducing a few new characters. With many characters from the last book killed (duh) it was easy to focus on the main ones and introduce more.<br />I will admit, I could have cried at a few parts of the book. I mean, its a book about a tournament to the death, but some of the new ones introduced are much more likeable than the last. Even with the concept, I was hoping for a lighter, happier book than I got. Catching Fire is darker, more sinister than the last book.<br />Suzanne seemed to give us more character development for the new characters in this book than the ones in the last, so when people die, you find yourself more sad than the last. That is the one thing I would mark down for. It's such a dark, twisty book, but terribly enjoyable!!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|To no surprise, this is one of the best performances of Michael Jackson ... captivating and mesmerizing ... there is not a dull moment.  Whenever you miss Michael, you can watch this concert and you begin to feel him alive!
0439023521|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and THANK GOD she did. I will admit, I am a sucker for certain types of books/movies/TV shows. Angels, Good vs. Evil, Tournaments, Post-Apocalyptic, and Reality. This had 4/5 and made my day! More like month.<br />The premise is simple enough, its about a tournament where 24 kids (1 boy, 1 girl) from 12 different regions (districts) are thrust into an arena and forced to kill evryone else until there is only one survivor. Katniss is forced to enter, and it is one of the most engaging stories I have read in a LONG time. I didn't want to put it down, I had to know what was coming next, who would be the next to die.<br />The only cons I could find were few and far between. The Setting, Panem, is from the ruins of North America they say. I want to know what happened to Africa, Asia, Europe. I found a few parts predictable/cliche, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it right? Last, the names of people. Katniss, Primrose, Peeta, Glimmer. It didn't kill the story, but names like Jessica, Daniel, and Mary might not have hurt. Well, except for Katniss and Prim, but to know why, you have to read this book ;)
0385341679|3.0|This review was first posted at [...]m.<br /><br />Shadowfever started off with a bang. The thing that I thought was least likely to come about had, in fact, happened. If you've already read the book, you know what I'm talking about. You're probably also familiar with the feeling that I had--disbelief. I knew that whatever seemed to be wasn't actually so. I doubt few people were surprised by the early-to-mid-book \\"twist\\". It was expected. I don't even think Moning herself thought she had anyone fooled.<br />  I practically gobbled the first fifty or so pages of Shadowfever. It's hard to tell--I haven't really gotten the hang of the whole Kindle \\"page\\" system. Though I have to admit I haven't really made that much of an effort. I wonder if I should... Anyway, like I said, this book sucked me in as effectively as Darkfever did. I was sooo glad about this because I wasn't as enamored of the middle three books as I'd hoped I'd be. Despite that, I was ravenous in my desire to get to the first big reveal that Shadowfever was going to bring. I was fully prepared to revel in its deliciousness. Which is why I am so very, very, sorry to say that, for me, Shadowfever did not live up to my expectations.<br />  Moning says in the afterward for Dreamfever that there will be triumphs. This is true. There are triumphs and--I hope I'm not spoiling anything for you--a happy ending. But there aren't answers. Or, at least, not enough. Every time Mac has gotten an answer in any of the books, it's only resulted in fifty more questions. I was okay with that--well, it frustrated me, but I was willing to put up with it--because I thought all the angst and the not knowing would be resolved in the last book. I didn't expect that we would get all the answers because, as you know, I think that at least four of Barrons' eight will get their own books. I pretty much expected the who and what of what they were/are to be only partially revealed.<br />  The operative word here is \\"partially\\", especially if we're talking about revelations. Remember that niggling worry I had about finding out that Mac could be saved pain and harm by the simple act of giving her some information? Well, it comes to pass. To total fruition. But that isn't even my major complaint with Shadowfever. Mac not only doesn't get answers about Barrons, it becomes okay that she doesn't. Accepting not knowing becomes the hurdle that Mac has to overcome in order to be with him. The message this story tells is that Mac was an idiot to spend so much time and energy trying to figure out what Barrons was. For one thing, (unsurprisingly) he told Mac so little in order to protect her. For another, it doesn't matter what Barrons is or has done or will do, or could be or is willing to share with Mac. And it's a judgment on Mac that she took so long to realize this and that was a message that really frustrated and upset me. Barrons tells Mac not to make him into a hero or even an anti-hero because he's not either, and boy is that the truth.<br />  In addition to triumphs, there were also surprises in Shadowfever. I knew there would be. I wasn't surprised to find out that Barrons was not what Faefever and Dreamfever suggest that he be, especially after the fake character interview KMM did with Barrons. If you don't know what I'm talking about, ignore that last sentence. Some of the surprises I saw coming and some I didn't. I had my fingers crossed for a happy ending--I'm one of those people who absolutely hates sad ones--but I wasn't happy even when I got what I wanted. I know that's kicking a gift horse in the mouth, but I can't help it. The ending was too perfect, too twee, too domestic. It involves grilling steaks and a dinner party, for heaven's sake. And we never get to see Mac's final showdown with her sister's murder. (I'm not telling, so don't ask me). That was a scene I desperately wanted to see. I think we still might.<br />  I'm sad to have been disappointed in this book. I also have no doubtthat I'll be in the minority. The Fever series has rabidly loyal followers. I've been a rabid fan a time or two myself. What I will say is that, whatever I thought of the end to Mac's story, I'm still looking forward to the next series that takes place in the Fever World. Hope springs eternal, they say. Which is my way of saying that the next series will be even better than this one.o doubt that I'll be in the minority. The Fever series has rabidly loyal followers.

B004DK49DW|2.0|Wow, this record is amazing....amazing in its mediocrity.  Is this Social D, or is this the new Goo Goo Dolls album?  Is Mike Ness trying to be the next John Mellencamp?  Was this record pushed out to fulfill a contractual obligation?  Was it dumbed down to get a single played on lamestream radio? Did aliens come down and abduct the band and replace them with Social D. clones?    The songs are pedestrian, the band is uninspired, the guitar solos are weak, the lyrics are every cliché pulled from the last four albums, and the vox are overproduced and sanitized. (Memo to Mr. Ness:  The passion gets leeched out of your vocals when you record the take 20 times to get it 'perfect'.)  Where is the intensity, the ferocity, the swagger?  What's with the female backup doo-wop chorus and the barroom-style piano? What's with the 'moon-june-croon' lyrics?  Where's that punch in the mouth I expect from a Social D. song? Why am I asking all these questions?    Because, my friends, I'm puzzled.  I understand that a songwriter and band will mature and their style may change -- but age hasn't decreased the passion of Motorhead, Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer, etc.-- they still come out and knock you back five rows with their new records.  I'll give this record two stars, because Social D. could play 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' and still be better than every punkabilly rock band.  But on the high bar set by the band's previous records, this one...reeks. One and done listen.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book was an assigned reading requirement for an Undergraduate Social Work course. I hate to admit that I had heard the word Holocaust but had no historical knowledge on the subject. Yes, I was a junior at the college level and had never been taught about the Holocaust. I found this book to be a great (yet painful) historical biography that I can say began my interest in learning more about the Holocaust. I have learned more over the years about his theoretical perspective of logotherapy and can attribute my initial interest due to reading this book.
0385341679|5.0|With over a hundred reviews in just a few days, Im sure there is not much more I can add to the mix.  After reading the first four books I knew there was no way that Karen could tie everything together and have a satisfying ending.  Boy was I wrong!  She is such an amazing storyteller and the writing is so lyrical.  I believe she is the only author who can make the \\"F\\" word sound like poetry.      There were still quite a few questions left at the end, which I am guessing will continue into the next series, but the questions that mattered were all cleared up.  It wasn't a perfect, neat little happy ending that tends to make a book feel trite toward the end, it was real and raw but happy none the less.      If anyone has been waiting to read this series based on reviews or comments from the first books, I say go ahead and jump on in!  You won't be let down.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I was lucky enough to be around in the beginnings of southern rock, roll and blues. An earnest nursing student by day...at night I was drawn to the smoke filled bars and juke joints where one could sit and listen to music that filled my soul. I can still remember the greats...Gregg...Duane...Chuck Leavell...Johnny Wyker..Court Pickett...Johnny Townsend..Lou Mullenix..Tippy Armstrong...Eddie Hinton...Jim Coleman...Billy Connell...Paul Hornsby...Johnny Sandlin....and many others creating ...playing and living this music. I am sure the music shaped me in ways I have yet to understand. And so I say to Gregg....thank you so much for jogging my memory and letting me live those warm southern nights filled with the music of my life.....
B003L20IFQ|1.0|How does something like this even make it on film? I thought \\"Phonebooth\\" was bad, but this one takes the cake - 90 minutes of nothing but showing Ryan in a box.
B0049OSQ18|2.0|The word I would use to describe this album is...disappointing.  Every song on the album follows a very predictable country/folk formula. There is not a single moment on The King Is Dead that made me sit up and take notice.  They didn't take any chances, which is especially disappointing considering how wonderfully varied their last album was.  The Hazards Of Love is a fantastic album - a great mix of folk, indie, and somewhat hard rock mixed with some very memorable lyrics.  The King Is Dead has no such variety. The lyrics are fairly bland and the tone and tempo of each song is fairly constant throughout.  It reminds me a lot of the album April by VAST, which like The King Is Dead took a strong turn from previous albums to the chagrin of many fans.  Judging by the lead singer's own comments I suspect the next Decemberists album will have a bit more bite. Until then, I can only recommend this album for country or bluegrass fans who want something light to listen to.  Fans of The Hazards Of Love and/or those who like music that isn't so straightforward should stay away.  My copy of this album will wind up in my local library's donation pile in the near future.  That is too bad.  After their last two albums I really thought I'd be a Decemberists fan for life. Now I am not so sure.

B00002MZ4V|3.0|Sony must have really rushed John during the 1990's re-recording sessions for a bunch of these tracks, as they have lost their original power and emotional impact through hasty tempos and uninspired performing. The Jurassic Park theme in particular has been transformed from a wondrous, majestic piece to a trip-trolloping amusement-park-ride soundtrack. If you really loved the music when you first heard it long ago, do yourself a favor and ferret out the original soundtrack recordings.    Note that there are a handful of original releases here; my guesses based on recording and movie release dates are: the main titles from Superman and The Reivers, Hymn To The Fallen, Seven Years In Tibet, Prologue from JFK, The Days Between, Somewhere In My Memory, Summon the Heroes, Look Down, Lord, and Duel of the Fates.    As a single historical collection, this set has its place, but don't expect it to take you back. If you've never seen the films or heard the originals, you may not notice, but you may not be moved either.

0312600844|5.0|Jonathan Franzen is a writer capable of being loved and hated in the same proportion by different kind readers. Most of those who belong to the second group despise him despite not having read any of his novels. Just hate him, because it sounds cool. For those who like to see the real thing before judging, the reading of his novels - especially \\"Freedom\\", his latest one - can be very profitable. Hate or love it: but read before taking sides.<br /><br />In an age when people are happy to express themselves using about 140 characters, Franzen dares to write a big, actually a huge novel - one that dialogues with masters from centuries ago, such as French Balzac and Sthendal, and Russian Tolstoy. Nowadays, he is one of the few writers capable of going back and forth in the narrative and not losing his reader, bringing flashbacks and anticipations, juxtapositions and other devices adding nuances to the story.<br /><br />At the center of \\"Freedom\\" he brings one of his favorite themes: the contemporary American family - and all that comes together with its member. The Berglunds could be any clan. The writer makes such a colorful picture of them - and the people around them - that we may believe we've seen his character walking down the street. There is no secret to such a great book: it is a labor of love and commitment to his art.<br /><br />The opening section sounds like a choir of many voices commenting the unpleasant faith of the Berglunds, who have moved to another town, but have left a strong opinion on the people they met. These former neighbors can not accept what they have read on the newspaper, but `[then] again, there had always been something not quite right about the Berglunds', reads the ending of the first paragraph.<br /><br />What is wrong with this family and why will only be revealed half a book later, but, until then, Franzen grabs the narrative by the horns, so to speak, and never let it go. Some parts of the novel are narrated by Patty, the matriarch. Her inner voice is resonant and interesting. It gives the reader the chance of following the family personal history through her view. Certainly it is a biased point of view, but, sooner or later, some of her facts will be confronted by life.<br /><br />The word `freedom' appears in the novel some times. It is always bring up a contemporary issue: where does one's freedom end to star some else's?  This relevant question is not easily answered, and Franzen is above of bringing solutions to the contemporary man's life. He is a writer of questioning, and not elucidating - and this elevates his novels to a higher level once it plants the seed of the doubt.<br /><br />As Janis Joplin has once sung: \\"Freedom is just another word left to lose\\". The Berglunds and people surrounding them may have much left to lose. But once they have their liberty usurped life becomes miserable, and the result is a superb deep and wonderfully written novel.and interesting.

B0040JHWKS|5.0|this is the album that should have come out after born to run and before darkness on the edge of town.It shows bruce springsteen in a new way of songwriting and explores his more piop music side.Maybe they should have put the outakes on 1 cd. And the pop songs on a seperate one.Still i play it eveyday and i am glad they put it out.

B003PIUBZS|1.0|Very disappointed. After unwrapping it find that it can not be played on Australian DVD system. Should be something on the web site telling people this. Then the return policy is to send it back in its original wrapping. But first you need to unwrap it to play it and find that it is not compatible with Australian players.

B003EYVXXW|1.0|Again very disappointing to get this product and find that it is not compatible with Australian DVD players. Perhaps there should be some sort of message on the website when a person orders from overseas. Return policy makes it hard to return something that has already been unwrapped.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This adaptation of Gaskell's North and South is a faithful retelling of the story of two people from widely divergent backgrounds who fall in love. There are hurdles, but love prevails. The screenplay, acting, and scenery are all first rate.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Beautiful throughout.  Absolutely and undeniably the most romantic movie ever!  Purchased the DVD based on a suggestion and was not in any way disappointed.  Daniela Denby-Ashe was lovely and Richard Armitage just blew me away.
B0034G4P7Q|1.0|This movie does not deserve the hype it is getting.    Having now watched the movie and discussed it with many of its fans and read the favorable reviews, it appears the appeal of this movie is a) that it's \\"smart\\" and b) that it reveals the grand irony that the founder of the world's most popular social network is in fact a total jerk.     I was not impressed with the movie on an intellectual level. The movie is essentially about the creators of Facebook, and not about the nature of facebook per se, its hidden privacy controversies and the fact of that such a shallow and virtually useless site is so popular in our soulless times. These to me are intellectual issues worth making various movies about, yet interestingly enough they are issues fans of the movie are quite oblivious of. Instead we get a movie about the creation of facebook and the petty controversies over intellectual rights (among the creators) for the site. Mr Zuckerberg as portrayed in this film is indeed a rather interesting persona himself, yet this socially inept, backstabbing cyber genius smacks too much of an antihero, that bad guy you like. Is it any wonder that in a time filled with so many egotistical, narcissistic facebook and twitter bloggers that this movie has been heralded as best film of the year and Zuckerberg as 2010 Person of the Year? That to me is just depressing.     Visually, the movie has nothing to offer. It's just 100% of the time people in rooms arguing. What they argue about (the intellectual rights to facebook among the creators) is only very vaguely interesting. Director, actors and composer do everything in their power to make said talking appear profound by talking super fast in noise-filled clubs, but it didn't help (in fact it made it more difficult to follow). The ending/resolution is abrupt and highly anticlimatic.     In short, this movie lets facebook users feel like they've learned a great deal about the site without compromising their own role in the site. Peoplewho watch the film come out saying whatever they like about Zuckerberg, but in the end they'll go home to their computers, mindlessly refreshing their facebook walls, posting status updates that no one really cares about, and adding complete strangers with whom they have nothing in common to their \\"friends\\" list, without once questioning why they feel compelled to do so. Nor, moreover, will they come out any more enlightened as to the dangerous role Facebook has played in undermining our privacy. The movie aims the lens at the wrong people (the creators rather than the users), leaving us with little more than a movie about annoying people making money.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie wasn't promoted much and the previews looked ok, the usual kinds of previews that a lot of times deflate to nothing when you actually see the entire movie.  However, this turned out to be a complete surprise.  It's a very funny movie, which is extremely well done on all levels - the animation, the voices, the lessons, the pace... everything was done very well.<br /><br />The little minions are so cute - I wanted to buy one or more (unfortunately they movie makers weren't savvy enough this time to produce decent toys - big mistake on their part). The jokes were pretty funny, all throughout the movie.  The story was interesting & not exactly predictable.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie was that there was plenty to keep both a kid and an adult interested, laughing & thoroughly enjoying the experience.  Can't say the same about too many movies, especially animated ones.<br /><br />Highly recommend this one... I usually don't buy movies, but this one I had to get :)
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a fantastic movie - though this movie stands wonderfully alone it is even more enjoyable when one has seen the [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] episodes (basically the prequil to the movie) because one has a fuller and deeper understanding of and connection with the characters.

It's an homage to the glamorous movies that Stanley Donen directed back in the 1960's like [[ASIN:B001K3JRY6 Charade]] (Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn) and [[ASIN:B001NQJH68 Arabesque]] (Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren) which featured two attractive film stars at the peak of their allure in games of deception usually ensnared in an even bigger web of espionage. Perhaps because of his musical comedy background ([[ASIN:B00006DEF9 Singin' in the Rain]]), Donen had a light touch that worked perfectly to set the tone of those classics. On the other hand, von Donnersmarck in only his second directorial effort displays a far more literal style that is anything but frothy, and sadly seems at odds with the souffl&eacute; touch this film badly needs to make it true escapist fare. He co-wrote the twisty, preposterous screenplay with two masters of the mystery genre, Christopher McQuarrie ([[ASIN:B00005V9HH The Usual Suspects]]) and Julian Fellowes ([[ASIN:B00005JKNF Gosford Park]]), and the film boasts the requisite star power with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />But something just doesn't feel right about the whole venture, and it may be a case of too many cooks in the kitchen waiting for their paychecks. Looking every inch the glamorous movie star, Jolie plays a mystery woman named Elise Ward who is being trailed by the French police working in cahoots with Scotland Yard. She receives a note from her former lover Alexander Pearce at a sidewalk caf&eacute; instructing her to take a train to Venice, find a stranger that looks just like him, and convince the police that the stranger is Pearce. Elise finds Pearce's doppelganger-to-be in Frank Tupelo, a meek math teacher from Wisconsin, and the chase begins in earnest as Elise reveals to Frank that Pearce stole two billion dollars from a surly gangster and is wanted for tax evasion by the police. The film feels like a series of heavily orchestrated set pieces meant to dazzle but only succeed in sputtering into incredulity, especially a sluggish boat chase in Venice's Grand Canal, the water of which looks ridiculously pristine. The ending is basically on par with Pam finding Bobby in the shower at the end of Season 8 of [[ASIN:B000YGGNIS Dallas]] and just as convincing.<br /><br />Dressed to the nines by Colleen Atwood and immaculately made up, Jolie looks stunning and acts as best she can like she is the star of one of Donen's movies, but Depp is strangely at sea in his Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart everyman role. Without a layer of makeup and his standard set of eccentricities, the actor flounders in an oddly blank-faced manner that makes Elise's attraction to Frank all the more puzzling despite his blind acts of puppy-dog devotion. A strong supporting cast has been assembled but given little to do beyond looking exasperated or confused - Paul Bettany as an inspector obsessed with capturing Pearce, Timothy Dalton as the chief inspector, Steven Berkoff as the merciless gangster, and Rufus Sewell as the mysterious stranger the police try to trail. Venice looks as inviting as it did in David Lean's [[ASIN:6305094934 Summertime]] through John Seale's lens, especially the glorious Hotel Danieli where Frank and Elise steal a kiss that sets the police after him. It's too bad that the chemistry between the two stars playing them is so wan.evasion by the police.

B003PIUC02|5.0|Absolutely AWESOME !!  By far the best TV series I have seen in a long time. A must have for any collector !!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I can't wait for this to come out on video.  I saw the movie in Chicago before its New York/LA Release and absolutely loved it.  The acting was wonderful, an outstanding job by all the actors in this all star cast.  The movie manages to be both serious and humorous.  Among the funny moments are the interactions of George IV and his therapist, especially when it is suggested they be equals during their sessions.  The backdrop to the movie is the lead up to WWII and the radio speech the King must give to tell the nation they are at war.  If you have even thought about seeing this movie, do it.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|We gave this DVD to our own teenage kids, an eight year old nephew and my in-laws who are in their 70's and 80's. Everyone was thrilled. David Attenborough's charming voice is a treat and the stuff is just amazing. It's wonderful to be able to sit back and be astonished again and again by the incredible diversity and beauty of life on our planet.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|My daughter loved the book series of The Vampire Diaries.   And we found the first season on DVD on Amazon.  We were unable to find it on our cable channels, so she was so excited to have her own copy on DVD.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|One of my favorite bands, I didn't love the samples I heard when it first came out, and kind of forgot about it until I saw them on SNL recently and realized what I was missing.  DUMB!  I just love this disc.  Every time I get a new BK album, I love it, and this is right on target.  If you're a fan, get it!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I bought this set of DVD'S for my husband for Christmas and they were one of his favorite gifts. Good quality product.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|Extras extras extras.  If you're the type that loves all the behind the scenes stories and such, this edition is the way to go.  If not, however, this product is overkill.  An added bonus is that this includes extras not just from the first film but through to movie 7's pre-production as well.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|Received the DVD promptly. Played it the first time without incident.  Replayed at a later date and had some technical problems with the disc.  Have not replayed the disc to determine if it is a permanent problem or just a one time glitz.    Will attempt another playing of the DVD at a later date to determine the cause.
0316067938|3.0|I'm a fan of the Twilight saga, although I'm no more a teen-ager! I've read all the books in short time, I loved the first one, Twilight, and I think this one is OK, a must read for all the fans in order to see \\"how it all ends\\", Meyer is a good writer capable of irony and entertainment as usual, but it's too long and too gory when compared to the other ones, and less credible (IF a word like \\"credible\\" could be applied to books about vampires and werewolves!)
B000VI70WM|4.0|This is a great album and features probably one of the best DD songs ever and that's \\"The Valley\\". I will never understand why they chose Timbaland to produce this album. I wish they would remix it the way it should be. Such an underated record.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I am writing to inform the general public that I am watching LIFE (british version) on Blu-ray using my PS3, I know some people were having some issues.  FYI, this is a fairly new PS3.
B003XOAJ6K|3.0|There are some good songs here and probably the strongest album featuring Warren on guitar, but I never liked him. He was an 80's hair band guitarist who was a bit of a poser. It's like Steve Vai joining Duran Duran..just doesn't fit. I don't doubt his talent, I just feel he doesn't fit. I'm glad they no longer have him in the band. Dominic Brown is a breath of fresh air...I like his playing better than Andy's even.    There sound really changed on this album. I like some of their experimentation although I'm glad they are back to what they do best.
