1455523550|5.0|The beat book I have read in awhile - will be buying more in the future - the movie was good but not as good as the book
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The makeup was fantastic.  The end of the movie shows what actors played different characters.  I bet you won't beleive it.<br />I had a little dificulty following the movie the first time.  It was much better the secound time around.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This mah jong game has many<br />different levels.  With each game you are trying to best your own time.  I really enjoy wasting my spare time with this<br />Game
B009MYARIK|5.0|Started a little slow but so many places it made me laugh, which in my book makes it a fun read.
B008AUGEFC|3.0|Bought the book after watching the movie. To me, the book felt a little stuffy/preachy - not quite as fun. Also, not going to give away the differences, but there are several key events in the movie that did not take place in the book (or took place in a different manner); and IMO, the movie's version of the story was superior. Worth a read if you liked the movie; but just warning you - it will probably be somewhat disappointing.
B005H9B44A|3.0|Pretty good movie for all, very safe for kids as far as language and innuendo. The women tend to like THor.  I did not fall asleep during it.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|The graphics are neat, but the precision required to win is too much for a touch tablet.  That or I have no reflexes.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is so adorable. The kids and I love it--WHEN it works,and when Gameloft isn't trying to charge me $20 (or more!) for a fake frakkin pony. Since the newest update it simply won't load. It's always been glitchy and the social network aspect doesn't even work most of the time, which is ridiculous considering the energy they expend pushing the feature on their users. I don't mind a few bucks in IAPs once in a while. But the amount of money needed to finish this game is laughable.  Gameloft--your product is broken. Stop trying to overcharge for a game that barely works on its best day.
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|But the cliche is overwhelming sometimes :) Overall, it is something fun to watch to kill time. I have to admit, the guy is too smart to be in real life. I thought he is from Heroes. LOL
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, she love it, have 10 DVD, all the movies, have a perfect audio and a perfect video, see this movies on my LEDTV 52&#34; is heaven.
B007PS0DTI|3.0|Its an okay movie, I still feel that something is missing to the story. I hate it when these writers try to expand something that should end at a trilogy .
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Downloaded the media server software on my Win7 64bit PC. Roku APP was FREE but I wanted to be able to view on the phone and tablet. Have already recommended to numerous friends and family. The auto metadata matching is kind of funky but it WORKS! Would like to have the ability to modify thumbnails for the actual Library since there are limited pre-defined options. Auto synch to ITunes worked great as well!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Love the story and its so fun to watch! It doesn't even really seem like a musical because of the characters.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is really a magazine article length look at what produces greatness in people; a review of some interesting research, then a look at Tesla as an example of the author's theory.  No real effort is made to relate the story of Tesla to the premise, except to say \\"see,\\" he thought big!  But in the abbreviated format it's sufficient to allow the reader to make their own conclusions.  I do think, that as presented, it should probably be on the \\"must read\\" list for every Jr. High and High School student in America.  Who knows, it might influence just one of them; and result in great things. Myself, I'm an old guy and wonder what I missed in life . . . could have done, if I'd exhibited the characteristics described.  Maybe it's not too late.
B0017P520U|5.0|It looks so real you forget that its animated.  Movie is too short for the storyline. I wish there was a 6 part movie collection like LOTR, definitely could make it happen.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I really like what happened on Daft Punk's new go.  Where 'Discovery' was a soundtrack to a fun party with slower tracks to keep you from burning out, 'RAM' is more like the soundtrack to late-nite romance with a few up-beat tracks to keep your toe tapping.<br /><br />If you're like me, and felt the appeal of \\"One More Time\\", \\"HBFS\\", and \\"Aerodynamic\\" rubbing off as you grew fonder of \\"Digital Love\\", \\"Something About Us\\", and \\"Voyager\\", umm... How can I put this lightly?  You'll enjoy this album.<br /><br />Staring into his or her eyes, lying on top of your car hood, at the top of makeout point - is the perfect visualization of what's going on here (maybe throw in a clear sky with constellations of two lovers slow dancing).<br /><br />Highlights are a little different because of the interesting tone of the album, but there are songs here that are unforgettable.  \\"Touch\\" is stunningly beautiful.  \\"Get Lucky\\" feels even more enjoyable than it did as a single.  \\"Giorgio By Moroder\\" should be a crowd favorite.  \\"Instant Crush\\", \\"Lose Yourself To Dance\\", \\"Doin' It Right\\", and \\"Contact\\" are tracks I love as well.<br /><br />In sum, Discovery pushed the envelope on what to expect from electro and made the french house scene a force to be reckoned with.  RAM doesn't push you as much as it softly slips your mind into the under appreciated romantic niche Daft Punk has so beautifully worked in the past, and now the present.  Discovery is an album that I'll always regard highly and Random Access Memories is an album I'll always be in love with.
B000I8ES5C|5.0|Its such a unique spin on a parody style kung fu movie.  Its like mortal kombat meets scary movie. Definitely one of my favorite movies.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|This is a movie that I wanted to like more than I did. I met the screenwriter at conventions and he seems pretty cool. The opening 10 minutes that set up the movie were an intriguing combination of decent acting and subtle exposition. Ethan Hawke plays a true crime writer who moves into a house that is a crime scene in order to write that one book that will make him famous. As he starts investigating the crime, he sees a lot of home movies that are all very disturbing. His research becomes even more insane as similar murders crop up other places.<br /><br />It's a great setup but there's a certain point where the movie becomes all about the research. There's only so much tension that you can get out of a man searching over the internet and that's pretty much exhausted in the first 20 minutes. The middle part of the movie is full of just too much research and while this might have been more scary in a movie theater (people are freaking out over Paranormal Activity after all), it really doesn't work very well at home.<br /><br />There's also the domestic argument scene that adds some veracity to the movie but is also a drag on the last act. The ending has some nice creepy camera work but it is conveying a twist that everyone could see coming a mile away.<br /><br />Still, it's a fine horror movie with many of the tropes that people have come to expect from their midnight viewing. There's nothing special about it. At points, it drags on with too many \\"spooky images\\" and \\"guy searching for clues on the internet\\" scenes but it's not a total waste of time.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|As I look at the reviews already here for Ms. McGuire's book, I see that I am  in the minority. I found Beautiful disaster a difficult book to like, however well-written.<br />  I was uncomfortable with the theme of 'extreme love' portrayed in the book. The boy (I can not call him a man) and girl (same goes) were both deeply damaged individuals whose bumpy relationship I could not condone. The boy was violent, possessive, and angry - the girl in turns angry and forgiving; she almost seemed to display the traits of a battered woman - consistently returning to her dysfunctional relationship. I was not rooting for them as a couple. I just didn't feel the emotional pull of a great love story.<br />  I rated the book with 3 stars, because though for the most part it was well written, I had trouble with the abrupt closings of some scenes - things seemed to resolve very quickly and wrap up with neat bows, with no explanation. I also found it hard to identify with the characters, it may be that I am just too far away from the angst of college and young love. I would however, let my daughter or young niece read the book and hope they would want to talk it over afterward.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Yesterday I went to Costco and saw this on sale for $30! I promised myself because of the NEW footage that Lucas put in to piss off true original Star Wars fans, I would not buy this trilogy. But for 30 bucks you can't resist!! Hope this review helps anyone.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|I bought this movie at the request of my then 6 year old boys. They absolutely love it and watch it often. They learned a little lesson from the movie also and told me that parents should always listen to what their children tell them and not just &#34;boss&#34; them around. lol
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I felt his pain in the children's  &#34;home&#34; and hoped something worthy would happen to make up for his years of loneliness. I couldn't put the book down.

B000W93CXQ|3.0|I didn't like this book because it was inappropriate and it all takes place basically in one night. One of the reasons I did like this book was because it gives you an insight to what people feel and that you should appreciate to moment.

B002RVCD6O|5.0|So harry potter has become the best freakin movie series ever thanks to the length and quality of the series
B00ANYJ3NI|4.0|Since I work in finance I devoured a pile of books, reports and articles on the economic collapse brought about by the sub-prime mortgage crisis. So, despite having liked previous work by Lewis I passed on this book, especially since I thought the treatment would be a light touch. When it came up as a freebie on the Amazon Prime program I downloaded it to the kindle and finally got around to it. Maybe we are far enough removed at this point that the horror and disgust at what occurred has mellowed a bit, but the book actually provides interesting insights into the issue by focusing on the first to detect the rot in the system and who set about to profit from it. Good book for the non economist among us as the story is told with wit and excellent explanatory skills. Still relevant after all these years - all five of them!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|So far no problems. I can use it with my kindle and iPhone . It's a fun quick game of speed and agility
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|The movie was a disappointment.  I started and stopped it a few times, which means that it was not \\"thrilling\\" by any means.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works well with most pocket knives, and gets them pretty darn sharp with little effort.  I haven't tired larger kitchen knives yet, but I have used the serrated blade sharpener and that works really well.
0385738781|4.0|The Death Cure by James Dashner is one of many examples of the dystopian novels of today.  It was published by Delacorte Press, in New York in 2011.  The final book in the Maze Runner trilogy, the book follows the adventures of Thomas, a young teenager who, along with his friends, is traveling what is left of the world in search of a cure for a deadly virus destroying mankind.  While trying to find a cure, the kids begin to realize that they should not trust WICKED, the group trying to find the cure, and try to realize what they want.  \\"They can manipulate us, play with our shuck brains, dude! How would we even know if they're giving us back our own memories or shoving new ones inside us?\\" (Dashner, 29).<br /> This book is a good piece of science fiction literature.  It is based on a futuristic world, with new technology, diseases, and landscapes.  It fits into the subcategory of dystopian literature.  The world is falling apart and the story has a very dark atmosphere.  \\"We need to talk about the future. About the end of the world.\\"  The virus was manmade, and was accidentally set free after a series of sun flares.  This is a very strong fear today.  Biological weapons are everywhere, even though people are trying to get rid of them.<br /> I think that Dashner was definitely focusing his thoughts towards younger readers.  Even though his writing isn't extremely elegant, younger readers want characters that they can relate to and a storyline with language that they can understand.  And even while keeping a serious, book doesn't make you want to stop reading, forcing you to go until you have read it all.  It definitely deserves at least four stars.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I just saw the movie on Sunday. Met all my expectations. As a practically life-long Star Trek fan, I enjoyed the weaving of the old Star Trek timeline with the new movie. It made the movie a lot fun to watch, and the special effects and action were quite simply awesome. Scotty and McCoy are great in their roles. The actors chosen to fill in the shoes of the old cast meet, and at times exceed, expectations. They really respect the roles as they were created, and yet are able to add their own twist on it.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />I agree to a point with the criticism of Abrams and where and how he is driving the franchise. There could have been more science, exploration and in the movie...after all, that is a major component of Star Trek too. While the characters were developed well, the driving mechanism of the movie - action above all else -took some of the wind out of the sails of the old personalities we has longtime fans have come to know, love and appreciate. While I love the chemistry b/w Kirk and Spock, there is something missing. Maybe I'm just being nostalgic. One thing that irks me - the love thing between Spock and Uhura. Bothers me to no end. It doesn't detract from the movie - it's just kind of annoying, like a forced love thing. That's Kirk's place for crying out loud!<br /><br />If Abrams continues to do Star Trek movies, I hope he finds a way to weave some of the classic elements of the franchise. Exploration, exemplify the best of mankind, and clever twists on the use of science. The movie was excellent, and I enjoyed virtually every moment (Spock/Uhura love thing aside). However, weaving the action style with more science and exploration elements would be my only suggestion.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Michael tries his hand at whole hog barbecue, bread making, stewing, pickling, and beer making.  In the process he takes you through his apprenticeship, his attempt at going it alone afterwards, and a history of each of these activities.  Really neat stuff to read if you like food and drink, and like to cook.  While I probably won't be trying any of his recipes, it's not because I couldn't.  After reading this you can try anything he did with the &#34;easy&#34; to use recipes in the back of the book. Easy that is, compared to what he did, and what others do.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The radar worked fine the first time or two I used the app. Now it takes forever to load, if at all. Uninstalling  and looking for something else. Very disappointing that The Weather Channel's app is a lemon.

193700788X|3.0|I'm a huge Sookie Stackhouse novel fan, I've read them all, but this one disappointed me because I was hoping for a better ending. I am going to read this one again and hopefully it will change my mind. I don't want to give too much away but I have to admit that as a fan, I barely put the book down.
B00499DRJO|5.0|This book is a precise description of a modern healing technique made available by intuition. The author describes how important intuition and spontaneous insights are for everybodies health and how it is possible to learn to see with the eye of your self instead of your ego. I like the approach because she gives practical advice and also gives a lot of good advice how to handle chronic illness and stress. Vianna Stibal's approach makes more sense to me than the 2 point method or other so called quantum healing techniques where author's like Bartlett or Kinsley are not able to really explain what they are doing. I feel better when somebody teaches me a method where he is able to explain how it works. I am simply a very practical type as I teach Belcanto with Body, Voice and Breathing awareness. That is why I like this practical approach so much as I tried it out for myself and for my mother and other persons and it simply worked fine although I had not taken any class. I appreciate books where you can have an autodidactic approach to what they are about and just try the method before you might like to take a class.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Iv'e always been a Trekkie my entire life so i went to watch STID last week with 3 of my friends who by the way aren't Trekkies and OMG we were blown away by this movie definitely a great Trek and one of the most beautiful movies i ever saw in my life! Packed with balanced amount of action and science and comedy not to mention the beautiful visual and sound affects! This movie caters to all kinds of audience! In my opinion the purpose of watching a movie is to to end up with a beautiful pleasant experience and Star Trek Into Darkness delivers that! The NCC-1701 is still Boldly going strong even after 50 years! Can't wait to get those DVD's!!!

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first, being free and all, as the free ones are usually below my usual standards. But man, I really liked this one. I don't normally read romances (though I do love a good LOVE story), but I was hooked from the first sentence and very happy with it, all the way to the end. I will definitely be looking for more from Mira Lyn Kelly!

B002TLSSXO|5.0|Great product no more mess on the counter, good storage and stylish at the same time. Highly recommend for all.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Terrible, terrible ending. The last book was bad, but this one was even worse. No action, no real &#34;ending&#34; or wrap up of relationships  and characters that have been so important to us and to the story line. For example, where did Eric disappear to? Surely there should have been more moments of torment and 'will they/won't they' in this book, as per every other book in the series. It's not a good book by anyone's standard and I almost regret reading it. Hoping a die-hard fan has the talent to put out an alternate ending that's actually decent!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Not sure why I didn't give this 5 stars, but it is certainly a four star movie. I cannot understand other lower rated stars and critiques. The movie makers took on a very serious, sad book written by Tolstoy and made it beautiful. I love the theater atmosphere. Just charming. The costumes were beautiful.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Such a cute movie. Loved all the cooking in it :) and just as every kid movie there are lesson to be learned within the storyline
B006QPX7UI|4.0|This movie brings the audience right onto the preparation for and the battle. I am a female history buff. The characters are portrayed very will by the cast. Fell in love with General Lee's intelligent yet compassionate person and all the men who had to fight in this war.
B00005JMXX|4.0|There is always studios coming out with movies based on the end of the world but this one caught my eye because I felt it best depicted the possibility of world events due to climate change.  The premise of the movie is that a huge ice sheet sheared off in Antartica and Dennis Quaids character a Paleoclimatologist does not know that this event will trigger a massive climate shift that will affect the world population.  I have always enjoyed Dennis Quaids acting ability and this is one movie that doesnt lax in that area.  The CGI is incredible with the weather patterns - ice, rain, etc and few other items that I wont disclose if you are thinking about purchasing the movie and havent seen it all the way through without the trailers.  Overall, Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job in the supporting role as well as Sela Ward.  This movie I beleive would be a good addition to someones movie collection.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|You will fall in love with the characters! Just a truly entertaining film. The plot introduces a serious theme and leaves you with a light heart, a warm a fuzzy feeling and yet, insight into a mental health issue.
B0099092QU|5.0|Is great for someone that like guns n Roses / Slash etc. The book contains just photos, but its a good thing to have when you love this music. The DVDS/CD, 10 points.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I hear songs on the radio all the time but they dont always mention the singer or song name so this is convenient especially if its not a current song that I have not heard in a while. Works even in public areas where they are playing music..
B005LAIGSM|4.0|I liked this movie.  Not your typical formulaic love story.  Really interesting that it is based on a true story.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Deceptively simply challenging.<br /><br />Once in a while, there's a gem uncovered in Amazon's Appstore, and this is one of the most unique of them all.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br />Feeling like a mash-up between an adventure game straight out of the 80's PC games and the 'Bejeweled' match 90's Internet games, 10000000 (Ten Million) is a cross between an RPG (Role Playing Game) and a puzzle game (in this case, a matching game).  Like the adventure RPG games, you have to accomplish certain goals to win and build up your resources and character.  However, the addition of the extremely challenging timed match game under fire makes this a completely new way of playing, and one of the best things about this game is that you aren't required to follow a set pattern.  The result is that each game is going to be a new playing experience.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY:<br />Your objective is to earn your freedom by saving 10,000,000 coins/dollars/points.  You do this by collecting items, battling enemies, opening chests, and so forth.  In order to do these things, there are several different tiles in the matching game, each with its own purpose.  In most situations, your adventurer is running down the hall and continuously encounters several different types of obstacles such as skeletons, chests, and locked doors.  You need to match three or more to perform the feats needed to beat each obstacle before you die or run out of time.  Furthermore, there are several goals that you want to meet, such as gathering enough wood and stone to repair the different rooms which increase your character's abilities and survivability.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />This one will keep you on your toes, and offer a blended game that you haven't experienced before.  And it does this without a single permission!<br /><br />I'll be keeping this on my tablet, for sure!<br /><br />[EDIT: Fixed typo in Title. Dang you, Autocorrect!]
B000BISBDY|5.0|If your a Cash fan, this a nice collection of his music.  This is pure Johnny Cash at his best<br />. Love it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|After watching HBO's adaptation I had to see if the books were better as is usually the case and was not disappointed. Characters that you quickly find you love or love to hate, intriguing plot, set in a world where the rules can change before your eyes. Even knowing what was going to happen didn't make it less enjoyable as it expands upon the show as well as there being some notable changes. I'll be pages into A Clash of Kings before I sleep tonight I'm sure, to give you an idea of how hooked I am on this series. The last time I was this excited about a series was after I read Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire. This book has a little of everything and a whole lot of appeal and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy, like all the kids and young adults who liked Harry Potter or Twilight and are ready for something more adult oriented but without losing the magic and mystical creatures. Even though the genre is fantasy, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written fiction, as the fantasy aspect doesn't take over the story, which is more about the drama of life that we can all relate to and that will make you laugh and cry as you follow the triumphs and tragedies of these wonderfully crafted characters.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've tried a few different apps that say they do what this one does. None are as easy, fast, and complete at ES File Explorer. By far the finest app of its kind.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely a page-turner, this book kept me on my toes.  Every time I started to get a feeling for 'whodunnit' or what really happened, the author would drop a bombshell and change everything.  I really like how relevant the book is to our 'true crime' - Nancy Grace - society.  The way Gillian Flynn portrayed the media and public opinion felt very realistic and gave the story a very interesting flavor to it.  It kept up with the current way in which cases are not decided by detectives, lawyers or even a jury but by public opinion.<br />I gave this book a 4/5 because despite the writing, mystery, and thrill, the ending was NOT up to par with the rest of the book.  I can almost live with the fact that throughout the book, none of the main characters have any redeeming qualities about them.  As frustrating as it was to read, there are people like that in the world.  However the end of the book took these already unlikeable characters and further warped them until they were mere shadows of who they started as.  It wasn't a character arc, but character warp.  The ending also left much unresolved and wasn't properly thought out, unsatisfying from a book where 90% of it left no stone unturned.
B009MYARIK|2.0|I tried to like this novel, I wanted to like this novel, I just could not.  Two of the main characters Lottie and Ben were not developed and the other two Fliss and Lorcan were only half developed.  How was I as a reader supposed to relate to these characters when I had no idea what made them tick.  I skimmed it just to see if all my expectations were met, yes you know the end of this story the minute you start reading it.  Boo Hiss
B005LAJ212|5.0|This was a perfect way to see all of the first season cant wait for season two what a great way to see your fav show
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccuWeather app is invaluable here in tornado alley...one of the best wx programs I've ever used.<br />I recommend it to every one who has an interest in weather.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I give this game a big 5 stars. Looking for something to pass time and stumbled on this. I am totally addicted. Once I finish, I plan to start all over again. 100 levels &amp; challenging.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|This is the raw and emotional story of portia and her struggle with her eating disorder, societies view on women, and self acceptance.
B00001QEE9|5.0|I bought this from my granddaughter.  This was a great story for my son and still a great story for my granddaughter.
1476733953|4.0|Hi everyone, for you to understeand my review i must first explain briefly my situation... I don't read books... never buyed one that wasn't for school and i am 28 years old... so i can't compare this one to nothing else... what i can say for sure, is that this book had opened mu eyes to this new world!!, the feeling of something intense running through me was something that i never felt before... so just for you to know... already ordered SHIFT omnibus of course, along with other five books... thanks Hough... for opening my eyes
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is a great series!!! better than I thought it would be. If you like a bit of sci-fi and action you will like this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game of skill. It also gets harder harder and harder as you go along. It is very fun to play as all the characters and try to beat your best score.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|For a 1700 UCF rated player this challenging and convenient tool that can be carried with them and relatively easy to set up.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've always hated \\"Soaps\\" - never watched them, never interested in them, and considered every one of them a waste of my time.  Then came the Masterpiece Classic \\"DOWNTON ABBEY\\".  Oh My Lord!  HOOKED!  Absolutely HOOKED for life (I'm 78 and looking forward to many more years of life filled with Downton Abbey to keep me company!). One can always appreciate fine acting and great film stories and work; Downton Abbey is the epitome of how great acting can be and how great a story can be that is worth every second of watching and following. (TRIVIA NOTE: I was a \\"small time\\" actress, always reviewed well and spent 30 acting years loving every minute; some professional, 1 movie, a t.v. show where I ended up on the cutting room floor, lots of community/college theatre and performances in U.S. Armed Forces theatre \\"at home and abroad\\" [am a Veteran, too - but that's another story!]. In DA the acting is superb; the plots are enthralling; the costuming is absolutely gorgeous; the characters are all fascinating and I'd almost sell my soul to the Devil to be cast in such an outstanding series of film. Mr. Fellowes is a very fine writer and he hit the jackpot with DA. The social mores of the period in which DA takes place are an education in themselves.  Don't miss watching this great contribution to film history and unforgettable to-die-for performances by an outstanding cast of actors.  Good Show!
B0091REZMW|4.0|good hidden objects game. only thing I don't like about it is that you reach a stopping point fairly quickly if you don't want to spend real money.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|Advice to Densel Washington:  Look for another \\"Man on Fire\\", \\"Pelican Brief\\" or other movie worth your talent and time.  I didn't believe your performance for one minute.  As an alcoholic pilot you wouldn't have been flying in the first place because too many people knew of your alcoholism and someone would have blown the whistle to prevent you from piloting a plane.  The only part of this movie good enough to mention was the way Denzel handled the plane when it became disabled - that was a noteworthy and suspensful piece of acting. The plot did not move me, the acting didn't move me, and this Flight should have been cancelled.  The ending of this film was ridiculous - it completely ruined any part of the movie I might have enjoyed (which part was miniscule overall). Obviously, the film movie-makers didn't check out the law regarding culpability of an individual in what they regarded as a criminal act. Give this movie a decent burial and burn the film negatives.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This movie is so AWESOME! I watched it in the theater over 6 times. I will never get tired of it. Jeremy Renner is super sexy:)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Terrifically developed characters that you'll fall in love with.  So well produced and beautiful performances by the actors.  I would consider this a women's drama - my husband would not like it at all, but I loved it.
0802130208|5.0|The main character, Ignatius T. Reilly, is indelible; the narrative is hilarious; the writing is perfect.  This book is a true wonder -- an amazingly entertaining and wise take on life in New Orleans in the 60s.  Even though it won a Pulitzer it's not all that well known, but it does have a devoted following of people who recognize it for the classic that it is.  It's right up there with Catch-22 as a great American comic novel.
B000FC12L4|5.0|Oddly enough, this was recommended by my nephew.  If you enjoy fantasy, but prefer the kind that has some serious substance to it, you'll enjoy this.  The characters are complex and well-developed within an intriguing plot, although as the second book in a trilogy, it will be helpful to have read &#34;Sabriel&#34; first.  (Also, she said, grinning madly, be prepared to buy &#34;Abhorsen&#34; immediately afterwards.)<br /><br />Of no small note is that Mr. Nix is a beautiful writer.  As someone who spends a lot of time reading rather poor writing, that alone makes the book a pleasure.
B0097K21YW|4.0|I downloaded it a week or so ago when it was the app of the day. It looked like fun and I thought my roommate might enjoy it since it had fire & blowing things up (yes he's a guy lol) Well he was addicted immediatley and I tried to take my kindle with me the other day and I got a look and a long whine ... but but I'm almost to the next level. I took it more for intervention than the fact I needed it that day.<br /><br />The game is fun I've tried a few levels it gets pretty challenging and even though some of the other reviewers might not have liked it as much it's a good game. It does have the bones of say Angry Birds as far as it has levels and it gets pretty tricky to get the fire where you need it sometimes but that's the point right to challenge yourself ;) I'd buy it if I didn't own it
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|J.J. Abrams did an amazing job bringing Star Trek back to life. He was able to capture a vintage 60s look and feel, yet modern, and perfect balance of drama, plot, introducing the Star Trek characters in their early days, etc.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great game fun to play lots of different things to do. Potion system is iffy and a bit laggy here and there. Overall it's good.
B00871C09S|5.0|Brillant storey of a invalid confined to his apartment and to avoid borement sits in his wheelchair using his photolens to view his neighbors through their windows.  He comments to himself what he has seen until suddenly thinks that a murder has taken place.  The Hitchcock thrriller is exciting and takes place in a small room.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Wonderful artwork, spooky soundtrack. Hidden object aspect was fun, but could be a bit more difficult. Interesting story line. Decent little game.
B001P3SA94|4.0|The only reason I did not rate this a Five Star is because of the factual depictions not being as correct as they should have been. As for as acting and the music, well that is a different story. A well made movie is putting it mildly. Great acting by great stars with great music....maybe I should have given this one Five Stars after all.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've been watching the Game of Thrones series on HBO, not realizing that it's based on a book!  I plan to save future episodes of the TV show until after I read the books.<br /><br />With two kids and a busy job I don't have time to read much for fun.  I have 3-4 fiction and nonfiction books sitting around partially read.  But this book has grabbed my attention and I can't put it down. I read it instead of the paper on my train ride to work and hate to put it down. I can't wait for my commute home so I can pick it up again.<br /><br />The book adds depth to the characters and a better understanding of the power plays that are developing in the TV series.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|There was a special on TV about Simon and Garfunkel, and I wanted to have this CD.  It arrived in good time, plays correctly, and I enjoy having it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got this dvd because I was in a particularly busy time and didn't have the energy to plan out my own strength training. I am a runner who enjoys strength training to benefit that practice.  I did the 30 day program with runs 3-4 times a week.<br /><br />While I find Jillian to be kind of obnoxious (she tends to say things like &#34;that is the feeling of fear leaving your body&#34; WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!), ultimately I found it to be a very effective series of workouts.  I saw visible change in my body and my running times improved.<br /><br />Now I still do the workouts but modify them slightly (heavier weights, etc) because I was pleased with what it did for my fitness.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|My whole family downloaded this game from kindle cloud.... we all loved and played it... my daughter was scared of the monsters at first by t really enjoyed and learned from the mystery

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Oh man this was a great book.  I love the way Grisham develops his characters, his writing style is sharp and crisp which makes the action jump off the page.
B00BOX0K0M|5.0|I do a lot of beach filming with mi go pro and really helps with the glare, specialy when taking fishing videos...
B009NY43NY|5.0|I guess if it had to end, I like the way Charlaine decided to go with it. She tied up all the story lines, but still left some wiggle room to pick it up again.
B004HF0PEU|5.0|I really can't add much to the two very full reviews of the previous reviewers, but I heartily endorse their enthusiasm for this box.  Arrau was in mid-career at the time of most of these recordings (some Chopin and Schumann solo stuff is earlier) and for many of the concerto recordings, Walter Legge was at the helm to assure as good sound as could be gotten in those days -- the late 1950's to around 1960.  The Beethoven and Brahms concertos alone are worth the price of the box -- Galliera and Guilini are supportive partners, and while it's true that the Philips sound of his later set was better, and he was excellently supported by Haitink, many critics have made the case that these EMI recordings sound a bit fresher and more spontaneous.  I don't know that I hear the difference in terms of musical quality -- rather, here is one of the giants of the keyboard, one who always has musical reasons for his interpretive decisions, and so he's ALWAYS interesting to hear.  In addition to Beethoven and Brahms, there are concertos from around the same time (1960, give or take) by Schumann, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky, all well worth hearing.  Some of the solo pieces show their age sonically a little bit -- especially the stuff from 1939! -- but most of the Beethoven sonatas here were recorded in the mid-1950's and are in perfectly acceptable sound.  Arrau's Philips Beethoven recordings (sonatas and concertos) are available as a boxed set too.  If you can afford it, get it as well -- and then Brendel, Serkin (not quite complete), and then wait until EMI decides to remaster Kovacevich for a cheap price.  It's a golden time for piano fans!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Even though Le Carre's portrayal of Americans in this book is dreadful, I liked the plot and the writing was as good as ever.  I'm looking forward to the next one!
B00985E3UG|2.0|I've yet to receive this book, but I have no doubt that it's an impressive one. (Seeing the picture of the book's cover makes me glad I have a Kindle to read it on, because having worked in publishing I know the rationale behind eye-catching jacket and covers for mass-market books.)<br />I contacted Amazon a couple of days after ordering it, to say I still hadn't received it. I receive a basically non-understandable (to me, anyway) explanation of how I could resolve the problem, and I'm busy enough I haven't had time yet to recontact customer service and say I still don't know how to get this book. I believe I've been charged for it already, and I'd love to read it. It apparently was sent to the wrong Kindle, one that's located in our home but is never used. One of the things I was told by customer service was to be sure my Kindle had adequate space for this book. Helloooo!? If I'd been concerned about space I wouldn't have ordered it. And by the way, both my husband's name and mine are in Amazon's records, and I thought I made it clear that I'm Paula, not Dan. (I'm the one with a higher pitched voice.) So, I guess my rating in this case is for Amazon's service and not the book, which I still hope to read.
B000QI2ZWW|3.0|It can get a little inappropriate at times (i.e. sexual innuendos). My kids thought the dancing penguins were hilarious, but I could see how some kids would get scared over a scene with a very mean looking seal.
B009YU62H2|3.0|I was really excited when I saw that this was streaming for free prior to the actual release.  I quickly found the earphones, plugged in, and clicked play.  By the time the album was (finally) over, I was just relieved that I was able to have heard it, glad that Soundgarden was doing something again, and couldn't wait for Matt Cameron to go back out with Pearl Jam instead.<br /><br />I never liked [[ASIN:B000002G5K Down on the Upside]] with the exception of a handful of songs.  I mostly forgot about this record and just assumed that Soundgarden was over in 1994.  I really wanted to hear more [[ASIN:B000002GK1 Badmotorfinger]] or [[ASIN:B000002G2B Superunknown]], and I felt sorely disappointed.  When I went back to listen to Down on the Upside, however, I realized that this was my own fault.  As other reviewers have said, King Animal is pretty obviously the next step following from DotU, and I should have molded my expectations for this album based on that.<br /><br />I never want a band to attempt to recreate its past glory in the present.  That's farcical.  Their tastes have changed in the past decade, as have mine - we just moved in different directions.  I've made it through this record a half-dozen times or so, and there's still nothing that really sticks out to me as anything I need to hear again.  Good technical work, good song-writing, Chris sounds great... This record just isn't what I'm looking for.
B00280LYIM|5.0|If only this series could go on forever but I have to admit it was amazing so can't wait to read the next book
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a heartwarming true story of the loyaly of a dog to his master.  This is a good family vidio.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Loved the movie! It's a classic Tom Cruise movie with everything going for it!<br />Another touching piece is how the search for truth is more important than the mirage to create it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Downloaded this for my 7 year old granddaughter.... she loved playing it.  Kept her busy and a great entertainment for quiet time!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This us a really fun game. There's a bunch of suits to choose from, and I like that. The game is similar to Temple Run in a way, except you get to shoot whoever gets in your way.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very suspenseful! There were a few twists and it made me want to keep reading- and I'm not much of a reader! I felt a lot of different emotions too, I really enjoyed it.
B001SN78JO|4.0|I like Jim Carrey as an actor/comedian anyway. This is another great comedy to his credit. I would buy it again.
B0026IWNZ4|4.0|Not sure if I would show this to anyone under say, 7, but for there and up it's great.  Only reason I say that is they do tackle the issue of &#34;who eats who&#34; and &#34;where bacon comes from&#34; but the voices/acting, etc are fantastic.  Really enjoyable storyline.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Very entertaining, with lots of low key humor. Johnny Depp knows how to put 'Life' into a chameleon. Fascinating story-line.
B009MYARIK|4.0|This book isn't Sophie Kinsella's best but it's definitely not her worst either. I found the story slightly predictable but it was a fun read nonetheless.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We really enjoy watching this show and love having all the episodes. It's a great family show that we enjoy together.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I liked this.  It was entertaining and full of action.  Tom is getting older, however.  I do think he parlays that into the war-weary, tired and beleaguered Jack Reacher.  There hints at an attraction between Pike and Cruise....but you know it won't play out.  There really is no reason given why he does what he does.  I have not read the books so I had no expectations as to the physical part....Tom being shorter....but I didn't think his stature was an issue.  How can he stay off the grid if he gets government checks deposited into an account?  Am I to believe the IRS can't find him?  Rented on my Kindle Fire 8.9 and the HD was good and never clicked to SD as sometimes happens.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|A lot of action and fun! And some silliness of course but that's what these kind of movies are all about.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Aside from the HD download to my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; switching to SD for about half the movie I liked this.  The chemistry between Brad and Jen comes a bit late in the movie.  They are damaged goods.  I thought his portrayal of a bi-polar crazy was really good.  He should have gotten the Oscar...not Jen.  She was good...but didn't have much of an emotional delivery as Brad.  The scene where she spouts football statistics off her head is unbelievable...and seems as if she is reading it.  That sort of emotion didn't sway me.  Two crazies getting together isn't new.  I didn't believe for a moment that this relationship had a chance at all.  One is clingy and needy (Brad) and the other controlling.  I suppose that sufficed in the script to show that they had an actual relationship.  It didn't really work for me but the movie as a whole was entertaining.  Great scene between De Niro and Brad when De Niro sits on his bed and talks to him.  You can generally count on De Niro.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Worked great for a day. Created playlists, listened to them at work.  Next day, MP3 download doesn't work, errors trying to play downloaded videos, can't play next video in playlist; causes errors, and my favorite, keeps playing the audio even though the app is stopped.  Not worth it for me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't normally watch dramas, but this show was very entertaining.  Season Two was just as good as Season One.
B000I8HIV8|5.0|II like this movie, my kids love this movie, my wife loves this movie, the lesson taught is richly shown and appreciated. Accept responsibility for our own mistakes and appreciate what we have, in time, we are given the opportunity to make a situation our own.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a fun game/activity. I look forward to the next one. I barely used the hints and loved the challenge.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Although it is not like having FB on your laptop or computer, it is still a nice way to keep tabs on messages!
B0041TM5OU|5.0|I've enjoyed this vinyl more than I can say. It's also been a wonderful way to introduce my daughter to Miles Davis.
0060936223|3.0|I found this to be an interesting read, though not great for reading on a tight deadline.  It is quite slow moving in the beginning and takes some time to get into.  I had only four working days to read this for my book club meeting, however, I only got through about 2/3 of it.  I did finish it after the meeting and found it to be quit enjoyable, but I think it would be more enjoyable to someone who was alive during some of the times she referenced (70s).  There was quite a bit of name-dropping of quasi-celebrities that I had not heard of and found myself taking breaks to google the names.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A very good book that casts a critical eye on our assumptions and biases that have a way of creeping into our everyday behaviors. These are among the &#34;raising awareness&#34; books that every good leadership team should read. There are sections of the book, taken mostly from anecdote, that focus more on general concepts of leadership, instead of the primary aim of the book. However, the majority of the book does focus on what all of us can do to elevate half the population to have an equal seat at the table.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie, the story, the acting...  INCREDIBLE!!!  There was some language that I did NOT care for but other than that it was soooooo good!!!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I did not find the book compelling because I couldn't get pass the picture of the infants' bodies. The story line got overly complicated and could have provided more insight.
B005HFUQAM|5.0|start to finish fabulous music. love it...every song is absolutely fabulous. If you buy this you will love it too...
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Sooooo I expected the jewel case and the cd in a  few weeks. I got the trifold version with inserts and of course the cd, in like...a week or less. Beautiful and prompt service. Will be my go to provider when i look for my next cd.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I have loved this show since the pilot and have been addicted ever since. I watch the dvd's over and over and still see things i haven't seen before or see how one season connects with another. The writing is so clever and the acting superb. If you haven't seen this show before i advise you see it from season 1. I love it and my dad loves it. There is so much more to this show than just it's scares. It's funny, dramatic, emotional and scary. Everything i love in a show.
B006M4F67A|4.0|No more changelling that any of my other Mahjong games. I don't know why there is a word limit on my comments
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My husband and my three year old absolutely love this game. It runs very smooth and no glitching or delayed reactions. Every week there is something new to collect and prizes to win. Personally, I think the fish prices are a little steep to upgrade and decorate your penguin.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love it! Can't wait to see the next season!!! But did people back then really say things like \\"as if\\"?
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I worked the first 6 puzzles in the 4 X 4 section with no problem then I got to puzzle 7 and from there on until I gave up and deleted it from my carousel the clues were not correct so it became furiating to try to solve..  The clue says XXXX was in XXXX and when you try to put that in as a YES or bubble it gives you an error.  For this reason I would not recommend that anyone waist there time or money getting this.
B000FA675C|4.0|This is not the best book to read if you are looking for religious \\"enlightenment\\" but the plot is overall suspenseful and the ending is not at all what I was expecting.
B000002I4S|5.0|It's just as the name says a enormous statement. So I spare you the talk about chord substitutions, advanced harmonies..<br />I didn't like this album the first time. I thought the tenor didn't sound like a tenor. I thought the band was rigid. I grew to like it, and to appreciate the amazing performance of Coltrane but the rest of the band is still trying to keep up. Except for Naima being one of the most gorgeous tenor song ever made and a great relief to the rest of the band.<br />Yet it's a staple in jazz, in improvisation, in saxophone technique.<br />Yes I'm a tenor player, and I spend about a year to transcribe and play the parts in Giant Steps and Countdown. I also wrote a few pieces inspired from it, and I got a lot from it. Thankfully I also met with the great George Garzone which was definitely an element into the ingestion of the whole process.<br />It's also very amusing to play that way in other contexts.
0142501123|5.0|A lot of people go on about The Gruffalo, but this one is my favorite of Julia Donaldson's.  Great cadence and fun story.  One of my son's favorite books.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Yes it's my favorite album of all times, gorgeous trumpet, insane keyboards and guitars, basses, drums, awesome bass clarinet and sax, early electric and electronics, extra intense energy, with a dose of spanish music, of blues, of stockhausen, of outerspace trip. Everyone should listen to this, and preferably while sitting comfortably in front of a nice big pair of speakers, it's definitely not light background music, it's the crossing of the jazz generation and the space age.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|A tale of a band of rabbits who, following the guidance of young Fiver's dreams and Hazel's leadership, leave the safety of their warren and try to establish their own home. Once they do arrive at Watership Down, a chalk down, they realise that they have no females so they try to attract some from the nearest warren but get trapped instead by the sinister General Woundwort, a fierce control freak boss rabbit.<br />Unlike the Duncton Wood tales about moles, these rabbits live among and interact with humans and other woodland creatures.<br /><br />Adams is a classical scholar and former soldier, who has hunted out a quotation for the start of every chapter, two for one chapter, which vary tremendously but include one from Tales of Uncle Remus who gave us Br'er Rabbit. The book may be dated now but it is detailed, unsentimental, well characterised and powerful. Can be read by any age from pre-teens up to adults.<br /><br />Read also The Plague Dogs - for older teens and adults. He also wrote Maia, an interesting adult tale about the mythical Beklan empire, and Shardik about a bear. His autobiography is The Day Gone By, worth a read.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|One of my favourite books getting even better in an anniversary edition. What more can one want? An ultimate americana.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Even though this movie has a few years, it reminded me on the TV show form the 60's !!!<br />Very well performed by Angelica Houston and Raúl Julia....<br />I'll love see it again !!!

B0061PEAUY|3.0|I ejnoy the TV series and this did have an interesting plot but I would have enjoyed it better in a 30 minute TV show.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Wonderful end to the Sookie saga!  I`'ve read every one of the Skokie  Stackhouse books.  CHARLAINE is the best writer.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Liked this series since it's beginning. Will be sorry to see it end next year. Great actors, good plots and fun to watch.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, very thought provoking. The premise of the narrators position is very different. Will definitely recommend to others. Not just a novel for teens but for anyone
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|You really have to pay attention to each scene because if you blink, you may miss an important part of the story line.
193700788X|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book and the author for not even trying to end this great series in a way that, while maybe not satisfying everyone, at least made sense.  All of the main characters that we have come to know and love got no more than a page or two with no substance.  No Eric, No Bill, No Pam, No Jason, No Niall, No Alcide, No anybody.  Amelia's father was the most prominent character and his story made no sense at all.  Yes, he's a sore loser and made a deal with a devil to succeed.  While that may be believable, the whole part about \\"getting even with Sookie\\" for using the C.D. to save Sam was ridiculous!  Why?  Because he got a second wish for selling is bodyguard's soul and could have used that wish to control Amelia if that is what he really wanted.  It was not well thought out and just rushed.  As for Sam - well, nothing he did was true to character and to have him act that way all through the book, then at the very end he and Sookie jump into bed and live happily ever after - no romance, no affection, no anything.  It was just plain wrong.  I could go on and on, character by character, but what's the point.  The series is over - there is no more - it was a big let down and everybody knows it.  Read it if you want, but not if you really loved the other books.
B000JFDBXO|5.0|This movie is why the series has continued and will continue for many years.  Hooray for comic books coming to life.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|The story was so good and we were not able to anticipate the next scene.  suspense filled with a great ending.  Haven't seen a movie so spellbinding in a long time.  One of the best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good plot and very suspenseful. Kept me interested the until the end! Would recommend if looking for a mystery or suspenseful type novel
B0047WJ12K|3.0|Content exhausting.  Enjoyed it the first time we watched it, 2nd time not motivated enough to try to figure it all out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Tended to not keep my attention anymore when they kept describing the interaction between the two. Needs more plot and got very boring.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|had a lot of fun so far playing the game; but you have to watch your time it goes by so fast you loose track of it
B00723NWJE|5.0|Yeah, I'm \\"old fashioned\\"- I buy CDs. I have been a big fan of Norah Jones since the first album, and while I don't own them all, the few I do own-including her duets album-I love. Very relaxing, and I would definitely recommend this CD to people that like jazz. The disc arrived well before the arrival date, and I have had no problems with this disc. 5 stars! The only thing I can say is a lot of the songs on here sound the same....but sometimes that isn't a bad thing!
1439102430|4.0|The Good: Dead newborn babies are always a attention-getter. But so many infants, to a woman with so many aliases? That makes for a compelling mystery. While I'm not usually a fan of these books when they're set in Quebec, I really enjoyed Tempe and Ryan traversing Canada as a whole.<br /><br />The Bad: The addition of Ollie was sort of disastrous. I think he was meant as a foil for Ryan, but instead of pushing Ryan into action where Tempe is concerned, it just made both Ollie and Ryan act like 6th grade boys kicking dirt at each other trying to impress the girl. And in that scenerio, everyone loses.
B004W25KKW|5.0|This is the kind of book you get on your Kindle just because you feel like buying a book.  I wasn't even interested in reading anything about Einstein, memory nor the brain.  I don't even remember why I got this book, it was that kind of impulsive purchase leveraged by a lot of good reviews and an interesting description.  What caught me about the book from the beginning is that it is the true story of how Joshua Foer made it to the Memory Olympics.  Not being a memory genius nor anything like that, just through pure mental exercise he managed to win the Olympics.  This really amazed me since I had the belief only gifted people managed to have this prodigious memories, but no, anyone can, and this has been a kept secret for millennia.  Reading Moonwalking with Einstein was like opening the Pandora box of memory secrets.  Although this knowledge is so accessible to anyone, it is never taught in schools!  How different would it have been going through high school if I would've just known half of this memory tricks!<br />Beware the book is the story of how the guy made it to the Olympics not a detailed description of all the memory tricks, which you can find anywhere on the Internet.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a very fun game that will go on and on. you will play this game more than you think and will spend more time than it seams
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is magnificent as Lincoln, the war-weary president. I've read a very good Lincoln biography (Malice Toward None by Stephen Oates) so I knew about his travails with his generals trying to get them to engage the enemy, but I didn't know as much about the political war Lincoln also was fighting trying to get the 13th Amendment passed. This film shows that brilliantly and even though you know it passes, you're still on the edge of your seat when the vote is taken. Sally Field is superior as Mary Lincoln, emotional immaturity and all. Tommy Lee Jones also turns in a fine performance.
B00005JKOI|5.0|I had  the movie in VHS tapes but needed it in a DVD and loved the movie so much that I purchased it!
0375850864|5.0|This book is juvenile fiction, so it is an easy read. If you're a fan of Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, you will quickly notice that Stead and her heroine are too, and allusions abound. L'Engle's book almost becomes a character in When You Reach Me, serving as a connection point between important characters. The main character, Miranda, is a \\"latch-key child\\" in 1978. She's 12 and awkward like you are at that age. Through the story, she deals with friendships falling apart, new ones being formed, old ones being restored and trying to figure out boys. Yep, sounds exactly like middle school.<br /><br />Miranda starts receiving mysterious notes of a slightly creepy nature. Here's the first one: \\"M, This is hard. Harder than I expected, even with your help. But I have been practicing, and my preparations go well. I am coming to save your friend's life and my own. I ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter. Second, please remember to mention the location of your house key. The trip is a difficult one. I will not be myself when I reach you.\\"<br /><br />Intriguing! I found this book to be well written and interesting. Stead pulls you along with short chapters and a compelling storytelling.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I loved this book. It can get a little slow at times though. One of the best things about this book is how it blends in so many deities from different religion. After I got done reading it I spent weeks looking up who different people were and making speculations about who others might be.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game glad its finally on amazon for kindle ! Love it on my phone friggin awesome dude!! Sweet and addictive just got it so I need to back to ok. bye bye now
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This film would fit into romance,intrigue,heart felt,teary and on and on...have watched it many times on TV and wonder why hadn'[t seen it while &#34;out&#34;...would love to see a sequel....
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Finally ! , A live album cd of the greatest rock'n'roll band ever ! This live concert cd is truly a statement for the Beach Boys and since I've been a fan for over 25 yrs , I can say that after years of doing ' hits ' shows , they've finally come out and pulled some rarities off the shelf for all of us die-hard Beach Bums ! I saw them in Cincinnati @ Riverbend on June 12 last year and the show was<br />just absolutely terrific ! There were some songs I felt could've been placed on this cd such as \\" Kiss Me , Baby \\" , \\" This Whole World \\" , \\" It's Ok ! \\" , \\" Please Let Me Wonder \\" , \\" Good Timin' \\" and \\" Summer's Gone \\" - but then again , you can't put everybody's favorite songs on a 2 cd set so this was just terrific in it's own right . Thanks Beach Boys for your concert tour last year and for the live cd from it . Surf's Up ! - Tim D.
B009MYARIK|5.0|love this author. she write really great books that make you feel good and they make you laugh out loud when you read them. Always a feel good book.
B00B7FXYJG|2.0|Bad choices for charicter Developement  IE: the Pres & Superman, the actions they have them taking are totally out of charictor for both ruins the story
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Extremely boring! I struggled to try and finish watching it. I love history but this was just a lot of arguing between the two parties just like it is now!!!! Gave me  a headache. Lincoln was portrayed really well though and good acting .
B000AP04OM|1.0|this product has nothing to do with the sound of music.  there are no descriptions of the specifc wavelengths notes produce or the effect that certain volumns can have on heart rate or the auditory nerve.  this is a singing and dancing movie about dead people who lived in europe before even color tv was invented. which is ironic cause this movie is in color.  go figure.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Superb! It kept me interested throughout the film. I cried a few times and laughed a lot The  scenes were gorgeous I only wish I could have viewed it in 3D.  If you are an animal lover like me, beware,  as there are some very sad parts .I could not watch. LOL  It was a wonderful story and much easier to follow then the book was.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Excellent action movie and thriller.  Tom Cruise is great as usual and so is Robert Duvall, however this is a must see for any Werner Herzog fans, he has a small, but memorable role as the villain of this film.
0385349947|5.0|I don't understand the reviewers who criticize this book because of the author's \\"privileged position\\". Good writers, with well-written books, may come from privileged or unprivileged backgrounds.<br /><br />But one thing is for certain:  both privileged and under-privileged women (of all ages), who want to move up in the business world, will benefit from this book!<br /><br />The writing is of high quality and the ideas are extremely important and informative. I'm giving it five full stars!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|One of the best movies of the year that includes great performances for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.  It's a must see for any movie lover.

B0067EKYVI|2.0|Baz Luhmann (Moulin Rouge!, Romeo & Juliet) has taken his whimsical eye and transported us into F. Scott Fitzgerald's world of money, parties and power in a new screen adaption of his classic novel. The screenplay was written and adapted by Baz himself and long time writing partner Craig Pierce (Strictly Ballroom, Moulin Rouge!), but the flow and ebb of this film lacks the romance and majesty of the original novel. This film is beautiful to look at because of the wonderful cinematography by Simon Duggan (I, Robot, The Mummy 3) and has an enchanting score by Craig Armstrong (Kiss of the Dragon, Love Actually), that is when you are not listening to hip-hop, but it just rides a slow wave of visual after visual after visual. Not substance. No meat. And, a very small heart.<br /><br />On the upside, Leonardo DiCaprio (Inception, Titanic) does an amazing job at playing Gatsby. He's got the swagger, the look and the innate ability to capture your attention on the big screen.  His looks and eyes celebrate all that is his characters money, power and parties all held at his lavishly decked out home along the shore. Leonardo knows how to create a character and live it well.<br /><br />Equally as intriguing and taking the audience point of view is Tobey McGuire (Spider-Man, Pleasantville) playing Nick Carraway, Gatsby's new neighbor and writer of the tale that unfolds. Tobey and Leonardo have some good on screen chemistry together as well. Tobey makes an honest effort to make us as an audience believe in the wonder that is Gatsby.<br /><br />As with all films, there are many plot complications that specifically revolve around Carey Mulligan (Drive, Pride & Prejudice) as Daisy Buchanan, the girl who lives big and dreams even bigger. Joel Edgerton (King Arthur, The Thing-2011) is Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband who also has a thing or two going on, on the side himself. The chemistry and passion of these four actors is palatable when they are together, however the rest of the film falls short of the mystery and magic that was always \\"The Great Gatsby\\".<br /><br />Long drawn out shots, beautifully executed and visually stunning, but too long and in some cases too pointless. It was also obviously shot for the 3D cinema because it's apparent certain camera angles, movement and positioning were designed to poke at you as you watch the film. It just didn't work, even for the 3D.<br /><br />A modern touch for this new generation was the added hip-hop, modernized style of pop culture music added to the soundtrack. It just didn't feel right. It didn't compliment the images, in fact, it was annoyingly noticeable. Oh well, a good set of strings and horns would have done the film much better.<br /><br />Overall it cannot hold a candle to the original film in terms of character development, action, glamour and pizazz, and except for the strong performances of the four I mentioned, this film reminds me of a cable TV movie rather than a big screen epic as the original text and film were. I usually enjoy all of Baz's work, but this one left me very very short!alls short of the mystery and magic that was always \\"The Great Gatsby\\".<br /><br />Long drawn out shots, beautifully executed and visually stunning, but too long and in some cases too pointless.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game for the simplicity of the game play that that still keep you challenged.  The game is simple, and a lot like temple run, without having to tilt the device which I greatly appreciate not having to do.  The best part about the game is that it's constantly changing to new cities and has lots of weekly challenges to keep things interesting.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|The trilogy deteriorated with each book.. And then he throws In a cheap ending.  What a waste of time.  If you loved The Lady or the Tiger, you'll probably love this.
1609611543|5.0|So much great information that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  There are a lot of books and information out there about gluten free living and eating gluten free, but there really isn't that much focusing specifically on wheat.  This book hits the mark and includes lots of great information that often flies in the face of conventional wisdom.  I highly recommend you pick this book up if you are even remotely interested in your health and well being.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|After watching once, we got hooked. Quirky lead actor is fantastic. Watson does a great job as well.<br />The writing and plotting is excellent. Who can resist an outstanding &#34;who done it?&#34;

B002O2THRO|5.0|I recommend this movie and I will watch it again. This movie draws you into each of the characters lives and at the end you too feel a loss.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|What's to say, you've got an album of all the biggest hits from a great band.  I highly recommend picking it up if your an old fan or new, you won't regret it.
0307742997|4.0|I decided to choose a book I normally wouldn't consider and found myself in the mystery section. Beyond the handful of Agatha Christie novels I read my freshman year of high school, I'm not very cozy with the genre, and honestly, I'd much rather watch Benedict Cumberbatch solve crimes on TV than read about some less Benedict Cumberbatchy solve one in a book.<br /><br />But alas, my impulses got the better of me and I snatched up Jo Nesbø's The Snowman. I'm rather glad that I did. I won't lie: I chose the book for its catchy cover art and relatively tame-sounding title, but Nesbø's novel (the seventh in the Harry Hole [Seriously?! \\"Harry Hole?!\\" Weren't you thinking of your English readership when coming up with that one, Nesbø?!] series) is anything but tame and much more than catchy cover art.<br /><br />The rest of the review is over yonder: [...]
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is a just a feel good flick with an element of reality embedded in the romance.  It's absolutely worth the watch; I completely recommend it.  When the credits start to roll you'll have a smile on your face.

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha shows she still has the power and the clarity that marked her earlier work.  The passion and energy to me are very evident.  It is very nice to see her re-entering the music scene after a long absence.  Hopefully there will be more to follow. Still a stunning woman at age 62.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It is rare to come upon a piece of writing that you never want to put down and you never want to end.  What makes it different from all the other ' slavery' novels is the inspired writing.  Grissom did her homework.  She created a world that the reader falls into.  The characters are so well drawn, the reader cares about them and becomes resentful and enraged to think that Americans could have ever promoted the abomination of slavery.<br />  This novel is so powerful it causes the reader to reflect on our world and realize the victory is yet to be won.
0525425772|4.0|First and foremost, I am a teenager who has read every book of this series.<br /><br />I've been keeping an eye on the release date of this book for a couple months after getting my hands on the third installment of this series. Amazon was really quick and arrived on the day it was released (preordered).<br /><br />Overall, I did like the novel, giving it a sold B+.  It included some modern topics that are currently being debated. It doesn't follow the previous installments where Theo Boone focuses on Pete Duffy and the murder case; it was very refreshing and showed Theo's continued strength to fight for what he thinks is right.<br /><br />The book includes politics (it will become very obvious), environmental issues, and the shady business Mr.Boone does. It does get a little bit bloody halfway through, but I felt the ending was a bit rushed and wished the ending could be a bit better. I was surprised Theo knew what &#34;eminent domain&#34; is, but has no idea where tax dollars go, basic economy, or what an &#34;activist&#34; is. Simply put, it's glaringly unrealistic.<br /><br />The book is pretty good. I cannot wait for the fifth installment.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|My son and nephew loved this movie, it was also rather entertaining for the adults too. Teaches kids to not stop believing in what they want.
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|very short and sweet.<br />i'm surprised no one has posted any photos of the steelbook. so i've uploaded them here to amazon. as you can tell there is no inside art, just the batman logo on the front and batman himself on the back of the steelbook.<br />the extras are really amazing on this. so many extras from the concept to making the film, to cast and crew interviews both old and new. its really chock full of extras. the original batman trailer is included, and technically there isnt really a menu for the bluray. the movie will start up automatically at the beginning of the movie, if you want to go to the extras just hit the pop up menu button or the top menu button on your bluray remote. that will bring you to an entire page with all the extras listed right there. a great movie so i highly recommend this steel book to anyone!
B00BURWSHA|4.0|Guitar driven rock.<br />This is my introduction to Burning Rain. With the likes of Heaven & Earth, Voodoo Circle and Snakecharmer, I believe this falls in that neighborhood. I have been kicking around which one of these that I wanted to jump on first and this kept popping up in the similar searches. So, I checked it out and discovered it was Doug Aldrich's project outside of Whitesnake, which he actually had going long before apparently.<br />I jumped on this, knowing Aldrich is a superb player. Does not let me down. Smokin guitar riffs and playing. There are a couple ballad types on board here, but my favorites are Heaven Gets Me By, Pray Out Loud, Our Time Is Gonna Come and Out In The Cold Again. Also an acoustic version of Heaven Gets Me By showing off his acoustic chops. This guy can do it all. Also a nice cover of Kashmir.<br />You may of noticed the other bands I mentioned earlier, which I will eventually get around to checking them out, all fall into that Whitesnake vain. Now some may not care for Whitesnake, but there is no denying the similarities and to be honest Whitesnake were a very cool band, even before they became popular. So, Whitesnake aside, if you are a freak for guitar licks and riffs this is awesome. Is there a radio hit on here, I can't really say, but doubt it. Supreme musicianship here and worth every penny.

0307895475|5.0|Love this book. Covers almost every single part of the game in great detail! I've been using this book ever since I got it and I'm still not finished! Very long game and one of the best I've ever played. Would recommend this book to any Skyrim gamer!
B000FA5STS|5.0|Really enjoy this author.  I've read most of them and can't get enough. Recommend them highly to all readers who enjoy a good book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I play these type games all the time and I enjoy a challenge.  This game has very good graphics and also a good story to go along with it.  I've played several G5 games and this is one of the better ones.  I look forward to the sequel!  If you enjoy playing hidden object games with a twist, then you will enjoy this one.

B008G8SFGO|3.0|Even the unconditional Ace-era fan that I am can burry the hatchet and admit that, in the end, Kiss came up with an album that is pretty decent. Overall, Monster offers a consistent bunch of songs. No Love Gun, no Detroit Rock City, just a decent collection of good songs. In terms of songwriting, most of these could have made their way on Rock And Roll Over or such. Obviously, arrangements are a bit more modern.<br /><br />Performance is totally acceptable - compared to, say, the Psycho Circus stuff which was at times absolutely embarrassing on every level (songwriting-wise, arrangement-wise, performance-wise and production-wise).<br /><br />Overall, Monster offers a very consistent bunch of songs. A decent collection of relatively good songs.<br /><br />The album could have been a blessing in these day and age.<br /><br />But once again, brickwall limiting kills the album. Very badly so.<br /><br />I'd really be curious to hear the actual mix or even just the raw tracks - in fact, I wish there was an option to buy the album in its raw form. What the guys heard in the studio. I'm guessing that KISS hired some very capable audio engineers and used the best possible gear, because the actual sounds seem to be great. The Ace fan in me has no choice but to admit that the guitar sounds on this album seem to be some of the best the group has recorded in a long time, make that ever. But what they did with those sounds... Uhrgh.<br /><br />It's pretty sad. It's my third time listening to the album and I feel like the mastering engineer just robbed me from a record that I'd otherwise enjoy, probably the most needed KISS record in a long time.

B00B69UQEO|1.0|As an avid fan of Depeche Mode since the late 80's, I can tell you that I tried, I really did.  I bought the album with all the excitement of a new kitten chasing a laser light but alas, I was broken by the results.  Upon first listening to it, I kept checking the album to make sure it still had the band members I have come to love.  It sounded a little like them but it was like someone injected heroin into their veins, forced them to record an album and then played it on slow speed.<br /><br />I listened to the album about 5 times before deleting the entire thing from my computer.  Not one song resonated with me.  The sounds were all drowned out as if it was suctioned through a hose.  To me this is by far, the worst album they have put out.  I pray time pays them a better respect.

I tried to see what Amazon had and I could not be happier. I will be sticking to this app from now on
B003L20IHE|5.0|The title of the movie didn't describe the content of a very good story about love.  Especially between Charlie and his brother Sam.  Another transitional movie for Zac Efron.  Think he is a good young actor and learning his skills in the world of cinema.  The movie was inspiring especially to those of us who have lost a close family member.  Realizing that love for that loved one never stops.  They are always with us in our heart, thoughts and memories.  Thanks for a good movie about going on with our own life after a devastating death of a loved one.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Seriously, I can't stop listening to this CD. The concert I saw in DC was my first Beach Boys show and instantly was one of my favorite shows ever (and I've seen well over a hundred concerts). This CD preserves their sound from the tour very well and contains many more songs than the DVD, with outstanding sound produced by Brian Wilson and Joe Thomas. If you crank it up on a good sound system, it will be just like you were there. The Boys themselves sound fantastic; all except Al Jardine (a force of nature) are a little lower and more limited in range than they used to be, but they still harmonize better than any other band out there. And what a back-up band! Every single one of the 9 back up performers also sing and easily cover the higher notes that the Boys can no longer hit on their own. While having back up bands this large for other acts (the Eagles come to mind) make everything seem very canned, the Beach Boys kept adding new songs and restructuring their parts every night, so the band sounds fresh throughout. In fact, that's one of the greatest reasons to buy this CD: all of the changes -- David sounding great singing lead on Getcha Back, Mike singing lead on the bridge during an Isn't It Time that is far superior to its studio version, Jeffrey Foskett's great lead during Why Do Fools Fall in Love. Plus the rare gems, like Disney Girls, Heroes and Villains, All This is That, California Saga, Marcella, Hawaii. But it's not just rarities, people. There are some of the biggest hits in the world very well performed here, and in many cases with far more oomph than the antique recordings we grew up with. It's a shame this reunited version of the band couldn't stay together, but at least we have this fantastic record of it.
B00471JSR4|5.0|Love action movies.  Dennis Quaid is great as the tough leader of the group.  And Channing Tatum is eye candy for all us ladies who like to watch muscular men running around blowing up things.  It's entertainment and a get away from reality.  Thanks!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Who knew match three could be so demanding? Finding the right tile to slide across the screen horizontally or vertically is a skill it will take you some time to master. Luckily the game starts out slow, but it will take some serious work to get to 10000000. Games are fast and fun, and you're always gathering resources and XP for your next breakout attempt, so it's never wasted time.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|What a great movie.  Arrived on time and in great shape, thank you!  Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones are the best.
0399226907|5.0|I love this story book and remember it well from childhood!  I gave as a baby shower gift so my new nephew can enjoy it too!
B000W93CHC|5.0|The author is completely readable and his knowledge of the history and people of that time is without equal.  His books are a pleasure to read and &#34;get lost in.&#34;  Without realizing it, the reader is plunged into early England hierarchy, laws, customs and everyday life and gathers tremendous enjoyment &#34;studying history!&#34;  As his previous novel, &#34;Pillars of the Earth,&#34; this would be a hefty book to hold but reading it in Kindle makes it all the more physically e enjoyable!!

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Yet another great album by the greatest metal band ever. If you love Maiden, you'll not go wrong with this.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I was in love with this game until I realized that you have to buy your dinosaurs twice before you can put them in the park. Then when they need to be evolved, you have to use your coins again. I think the true object is for you to spend real money to get the in app money to continue agressive play. Now I'm not as quick to evolve the dinosaurs. I let them make coins for several turns first. One dinosaur took 67,000 coins to evolve. :-(
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I had never heard of this band, till a good friend turned me on them. Great energy, great lics, and even better when you see them live. Gonna keep them in my rotation.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|This book brings you directly into his addiction. Very graphic. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. At times I found myself thinking this can't be real. But it was.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|An irreverent blend of myth, adventure, fantasy and pop culture, this novel is the first of a series I am eager to continue reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Research for these these books must have been too exstensive and  enjoyable. The bondage was intensely enjoyable. She made you REALLY want to try these things. I am so sorry for the people who were to religious or too nieve to read this series. I read the complete series 3 times completely. the 2nd time because the sex part so overwhelmed me that I missed the stors plot. The 3rd time for clairity. This is what I got from this story. A very controlling  business man met a young inexperienced young woman who turned the tables on him. She made him question all of this life choices. He had all intentions of changing him but she changed him. she made him belive all the things he felt wrong for him was just what his life needed. Please don't read these books just for the sex it is a very beautiful story. Were it not for the sex it would be a fairy tale. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Have to admit, i am reading the Aubrey/Maturin novels for the second time around - this time electronically instead of from the library.  They are absolutely superb.  Stockwin is great, but O'Brian is the master.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|It's a great hilarious movie so watch it!!! Go Ferris Bueller!!! I would not watch it with kids who don't know what swear words are though...
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Great story, great action and fight scenes. However, I was a little sickened by Tom's attempts to play the smoldering stud. The script is full of cheesy, macho single lines remniscent of an 80s cop movie, but those tidbits gave me a few chuckles in an otherwise dramatic action flick.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|For those of us who reminisce about the beautiful, old books we lovingly read as we grew up and into our adult years but also embrace the technology of the present, this is a delight to read.  I think the ending was perfect.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|What an awesome addition to the Iron Man franchise and the Marvel library. This movie has everything! Robert Downy, Jr. (still the best casting that Marvel has ever done), a solid story, lots of humor, and copius amounts of action. Don Cheadle (looking quite pumped up, I must say) as Col. Rhoades, aka: Rhoadie, really gets his chance to kick ass in this one. Great casting all the way around, with Guy Pierce delivering his usual high caliber acting and Gweneth Paltrow as loveable as ever.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I love this book! It has good characters and awesome word choice that makes every sentence paint a picture in your brain that will last forever!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This wasn't a terrible book, but it wasn't particularly good, either.  The author seemed to just want to play on people's emotions and make the reader sad without much character development behind it.  It reminded me a lot of Twilight, except with cancer instead of vampires.  The star-crossed teenage lovers have nothing in common, except for their inevitable untimely deaths, and their romance blossoms without any real relationship development.  Similar to Twilight, the male love-interest is portrayed as remarkably handsome, yet falls for the unremarkable narrator.  The narrator is portrayed as an awkward, self-conscious, introverted teenage girl who loves books and Chuck Taylors--basically allowing any sort-of-shy teenage girl to insert herself into the role and easily relate to the character.  The book was good enough for a quick read, but I think the author was very manipulative without offering very much plot substance.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a very interesting book.  The author has an excellent writing style so the book just zips along.  Really enjoyed the read
068487217X|5.0|One of the best books I have read.  Another favorite is &#34;The Glass Castle&#34;.  Makes you realize how fortunate most of us<br />are and how the main character in both books became very successful.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is a very quick way to get a handle on upcoming weather.  I would highly recommend it to anyone
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan all my life.. but with the last 6 movies I've had enough of Star Trek forever until Mr. \\"genius\\" Abrams reimagined it from a better perspective.  Its not about who is smarter than the villain, Spock, Scotty, or Kirk its about who has the best gadgets and the best hard bodies.. Even the oyster face man was hilarious. One word: Star Trek Into the darkness is badar^&^e.<br /><br />One of the reasons Star Trek died in the 90's is because the cast became aged. Star Trek is for young people and it made me feel young again. This Star Trek got a huge face lift and I love it (complete with toys and all). To be honest about what killed it for me in the 90's was the constant Klingon crap.<br /><br />The part where Abrams introduces a super Enterprise is just jaw dropping. I was all over that saying holy cow Star Fleet Admiral kicks butt. He pawned Kirk! I totally enjoyed seeing Captain Kirk get all teary-eyed begging the Admiral for another chance.<br /><br />There is a scene where the Admirals daughter pops into the picture and you say is that her????? Then you all of a sudden remember Kirk had a son.<br /><br />The love affairs with the O-hoorah was funny, and the new Kirk makes fun of it- which elicites a laugh from me. I need laughs from ST.<br /><br />I must say the ending was a shocker... no wonder Kirk was superior.<br /><br />I'm preordering 3d/Blu-ray, DVD, digital.. right now.  I can't wait for this to get on my private big screen in 3d.  I hope ST3 will explain the rest of Kirk's early life.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a good starting Mahjong game, especially for younger people or beginners.  Starts with simpler boards and then builds on that
B00C10N3EW|5.0|The art and talent of Joe Bonamassa can not be compared. Most amazing live bluegrass I've ever heard. You will not be disappointed.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow. I don't know what else to say. I'm actually finding this review very difficult to write because I don't know how to put into words how awesome I find this book.      The book starts with Drew at home miserable from the \\"flu\\". A flu that sounds a lot like a broken heart. Oh, did I love Drew!! More and more books are being written from the male's point of view, and while I think that's awesome, they can sometimes be a bit, . . . whiney. Drew? Oh, Drew is allllll man. Did you ever have a friend who was a total man whore, someone who just called `em like it was, but their personality was so enchanting that you couldn't help but love them? That is Drew. The fact that we get to listen in on his private thoughts only add to his appeal. Drew is funny and brash. He knows what he wants and he gets it. Every time. Until Kate.      Drew and Kate meet for the first time at a club. In typical Drew fashion he hits on her with the intention of taking Kate home with him. When Kate shoots him down Drew is more than intrigued. A woman saying no to Drew? Unheard of! Monday morning Drew gets a second surprise when who other than Kate is the newest member of his father's company. Good news right? Now Drew can woo her from work, sleep with her and get over whatever attraction her feels. Oh, Drew, you are so wrong.    What happens next was one of the funniest back and forth between two people I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Drew's father tasks the pair to come up with an idea to present to a big client; they'll both create a presentation, whoever comes up with the best idea wins.  And with that, it's on. Oh, my friends it is so on.    Kate was the perfect heroine. She didn't put up with Drew's s***. Anytime Drew thought he had bested Kate she came back at him twice as hard.  When Drew checked out a book from the firm's library and wouldn't share it, Kate checked out all the books from the library. I love it! Kate wasn't some pushover, scared to step on the boss' son's toes. Kate not only stepped on those toes she kicked him in the shins when she was done stepping!    All that passion the two had while fighting? Well get ready, cause when that passion turned to the bedroom, holy hotness batman. Being able to see what Drew was thinking every time he touched Kate was not only scorching hot, it also allowed us to realize, probably even before Drew, his true feelings for Kate.    So now you're thinking great, guy meets girl, guy and girl fight, guy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. Well my friends, here's what makes this story so great. I seriously want to kiss author Emma Chase for not just giving us an easy happily ever after. I'm not going to go into details. But everything that Drew has gotten so easy in his life? Yeah, Kate is not going to be one of them.    I'm trying to think of one thing I didn't like about this book but I honestly can't come up with anything. I loved Drew and all his bizarre explanations for how the male mind works. I loved that Kate wasn't a pushover. I loved their family and friends. I loved, well, . . . everything.    I've said it before but I'll say it again. I DO NOT give five stars easily. For me to give five stars a book has to have it all; great characters, an interesting storyline, and romance that jumps off the page. This book had it all, and if possible more. So go, run don't walk, to your nearest Kindle, Nook, computer, whatever the hell you read on, and buy a copy of this book! You know what? Buy two just in case.

B002N7RAH4|2.0|To me the film was to gory and not very funny. It was a spoof but did entertain me.  This was the first movie I have paid and streamed from amazon. I should have saved my money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I basically binged watched all three seasons and can't wait until the next one.  It had something for everyone.  Love, lust, murder and death.  Loved it.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Great movie for the family.  Inspiring story.  Acting is well done.  Awesome footage of the waves.  Best surfing movie i've seen.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|a classic of French literature, the story of jean valjean and inspector javert is truly an inspirational tale of morality good and evil. there are times when hugo uses long winded passages that seem to have nothing to do with the storyline but this is the style of novel writing of the time. most is interesting but stick with it because the human storylines will have you glued to this book.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The four main characters in this series have really made this series a favorite for me.  I love the intellectual aspect of the shows as well as the humanistic components of Sherlock's struggle with addiction, Watson's career changes.  Captain Gregson's character and Lieutenant Bell are also superbly interpreted roles.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is an excellent movie...full of intrigue, excitement, and full of southern culture...if you like Jamie Foxx you will love this movie...
B0063M22QO|4.0|good fun game with a big variety of tile faces and game set up shapes--very entertaining and a good time fill-in while waiting
B005S9ELY4|5.0|Gangster Squad was by far the best movie I've seen in a long time...So glad they reshot it without the theater shoot-out scene..Sean Pean was at his best and so was Ryan Goslyn...The entire cast is to be commended...The story is about a ganster who wants full control of the city and the cops who try to stop it....if you like intrigue, shootouts...then this movie is for you...
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|It's hard not to make comparisons to the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring. This movie does a good job of backtracking to explain how Bilbo became who he is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say except that I loved this book...full of sex, excitement, intrigue and once I finished this book I missed the characters...I immediately wanted to read it again.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is awesome. I highly recommend it for all audiences; especially men who are fathers, have fathers, or want to be fathers.

B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Fantastic service with delivery just in time for my son's birthday.  My boy had been wanting this for quite some time, and we couldn't find it in any of the stores.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I haven't played the game very much, but from what I have played, it is smooth, great graphics, and no issues thus far!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not usually into sci-fi novels. It's just not my thing. Five years ago, when my boyfriend (now husband) told me I had to read this book, I scoffed at him. This is a book for children and its sci-fi. No way was I going to like it. After months of persuasion I finally agreed to read it. I was skeptical until I read the first few pages, and then I was hooked! I couldn't put this book down. A few days ago with the new trailer for the movie came out I decided it was time to re-read Enders Game.  It made me feel the same way all over again. I still got the goosebumps, my heart still raced, I won't tell you any other reaction I may have had because I don't want to ruin anything for you. This book is a must read, a true classic. You won't be disappointed.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Love i, helps me connect with my pages and content that I post.  Best FB app out there today in my opinion
B00908DDZM|5.0|We got the original uncut version and love the entire CD! We listen to it all the time. Love it.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It gives a great introduction to the consultancy life and helps a lot to understand what the top management consulting is searching for a perfect candidate! Absolutely great!
193700788X|1.0|Yawn, so disappointed in this book!<br /><br />Like many others have said hated the 3rd person, hated how she wrapped up characters, and hated how it ended.
B006M4F67A|5.0|been playing all this games for awhile.really like playing all of them. it is very a very skilled like game to do.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Omg I love this take si much I could not even stop playin.<br /> My whole family has this game and we all try l to bet everyone. LOVE IT SOOOOO MUCH.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's cool. I just don't know what to do when you invade somebody. They also not super money hungry like other game developers like glu. I hate those guys. Charge hundred bucks for stupid upgrades. This game doesn't do that or let you get so far you have You have to buy. It's cool.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Keep my interest with wit, humor, romance, etc. I would highly recommend this movie as a must see for a great night in.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game for free. Although trying to win levels and score in the top 250 for the tournament game is challenging. I've been trying for over 2 years and have yet to accomplish this task.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|The first volume of Nashville tv  show soundtrack was such an upbeat feel good get u going experience. I play it over and over while driving. Love it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Really enjoyed the book. However, I just read it and I am missing the last 4 pages of the book on my kindle. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|It's not like the google search on laptop. I need something easier to navigate for my daughter. She is 9 and this is confusing
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|it had moments of humor, but was overall painful.  we had high hopes for it.  not so sure I would have rented it now that I watched it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Having fallen for the characters already, it's hard for me not to like another installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Having said that, I didn't find this one as engaging a read as some of the earlier ones.  The writing style was a little different, and there's all that work to tie up loose ends for the characters in this final book.  If you've read the others, you have to read this one too, to see how it all sorts out.  Just be aware that you may be left wanting more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book out of all three books! It's so intense. It made me laugh. It made me cry. I LOVE IT!
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|There is, in many circles, a certain preconceived notion of the My Little Pony franchise. This film blew away mine.<br /><br />Faulkner once wrote that the  only thing worth writing about was the human heart in conflict with itself. If there were one reason why I gave this five out of five stars, it is because of how well the writing explored the tension between Twilight Sparkle's conscience and the pressures of an increasingly dystopic and totalitarian Equestria.<br /><br />In only 72 minutes, the film succeeds in balancing a dark personal drama against a larger story of the redemption of Equestria.<br /><br />The film is definitely not suitable for children. The film plunges into the depths of human depravity, utilizing some imagery that was hard to watch. The violence may have been a card played too often and too enthusiastically, with brutal decapitations and firing squads, but it did provide a beautifully poignant contrast to the friendship of the heroines.<br /><br />Tara Strong turns in a solid performance as Twilight Sparkle, somewhat reminiscent of Anne Hathaway's Fantine--the tragedy and suspense of the character build upon each other marvelously. I was less certain about the casting choice of Christopher Lee as Princess Celestia, who had in past installments been portrayed by Nicole Oliver, but his gripping voice lends a certain weight to the role, which befits the overall tone of the piece. Surprisingly, it was Peter New as Big Macintosh who delivered the most dynamic and electrifying performance, turning what may have been dull, extensive dialogue into memorable and inspiring soliloquies that really drove home the message of the film.<br /><br />Although it was at times heavy-handed, it avoided resorting to cliché or coming off as manipulative (or abusive, in the more gruesome scenes) of the viewer's emotion. It treats the darker subjects with respect, but gravity. The cast performed wonderfully. In all, it is a solidly great film, worthy of inclusionin any serious film enthusiast's collection.
0312430000|5.0|As an engineering project manager, this manifest on &#34;doing things right&#34; has really helped my work go more smoothly.  Highly recommended.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Glad to see this game available for kindle. I look forward to more vehicles and stages. Head for the moon to score big air points.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This movie is creepy without the gore and the blood. I remember the first time I saw it I was scared speechless. I love this movie!
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|This new Bowie album sounds utterly fantastic on vinyl, much better than the CD. If somebody makes a better album this year, I'll be hospitalized ... it's unsettling, mostly dark and very agressive in its sound ... sheer genius, one of the 6 or 8 best records David Bowie ever made.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I loved it and since i watched iron man 3 the second day it came out in theater i know it actually sort of follows the story and its a really accurate and good game.
1935597760|5.0|I love the author's writing style.  She moves between the main character's childhood and his present experience.  The character development and story is excellent!  Great book to read!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I watched this after seeing the original European version. Aside from a few subtle changes it closely matched the first version. The Euro version was sexually more explicit, however. I also did not care much for the changed ending, even though it did fit in with the story line.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app was fast to download and easy enough for my 9 year old to figure out. She had another alarm clock on her smart phone that would randomly turn off so she needed something more reliable. This alarm clock hasn't let us down yet!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|A good action story, pretty much what I expected. The DVD played well, but I had some problems with the Blu Ray version. I will have to recheck and see if it was my settings.
B00555Z2MQ|5.0|Fantastic songwriting, wonderfully mixed and recorded.  This does not meet the sophmore slump, in fact it is the antithesis of such newcomer pitfalls.  This album, along with Fold Your Hands Child You Walk Like a Peasant are my favorite B&S.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|the game starts out as a pretty good game but it quickly looks to get you to buy credits. not my gig. if it weren't so monetarily centered it would have been 4 to 4 1/2 stars
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Builds on the score from the first, some nice extra pieces as well.  Keeps the movie in my head (till the DVD comes out)!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a fun game simple controls and fun graphics easy enough for a child, but also the game is challenging for an adult (will make more sense if u play)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book, couldn't put it down. I wish the story could continue as the characters were  so well written.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Iron Man 3 was absolutely fantastic.  The change in directors does mean there's some difference in style.  Shane Black loves a bit of narration and has different taste in music than Jon Favreau.  (I missed the classic rock.)  But there doesn't seem to be any animosity in the changeover.  In fact, Favreau's role as bodyguard Happy Hogan was expanded.<br /><br />But perhaps the biggest change in Iron Man 3 is that it's not all about Tony Stark.  (Although, in the end, it is.)<br /><br />Much like Favreau, Don Cheadle gets a bigger part to play.  I'm am fully in favor of that, because Cheadle is terrific as Colonel Rhodes.  He's a good guy, but not a boring one.  And when given more screen time, Cheadle imbues Rhodey with enough of a sense of fun that you believe he and Tony Stark could be best friends.<br /><br />And speaking of cast chemistry, Gwynth Paltrow continues to have tons with Robert Downey, Jr.  Her Pepper Potts is competent, compassionate, forgiving, but not a pushover.  She's firm and has zero time for b.s. from her boyfriend or monologuing villains.  I don't care how you feel about Paltrow; I can't imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />Same goes for RDJ, who really plays up Tony's vulnerability after sacrificing himself in The Avengers.  He's faced tough situations before, but deliberately choosing to die really did a number on his psyche.  It leads to some great scenes when Tony teams up with a kid who can't keep his mouth shut around a real live superhero.<br /><br />Of course, summer blockbusters and superhero films are all about the big fight scenes.  Iron Man 3 lives up to any expectations I had on that count.  The final battle is kinetic and visually delightful and still allows for some nice character beats.  I would've left the theater with a smile on my face even if the falling action wasn't just as terrific.<br /><br />Iron Man fans, don't miss this one.  And, like all Marvel films, be sure to stay till after the credits.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book immensely.  When you &#34;start with food&#34; you get to see the big picture. This book answered many of my food questions as well.  I was pessimistic about the information when I first heard about it so I am happy that I actually gave the book a chance and actually read the information.  I will be at the end of my 30 days next week and I am already thinking that I may just continue this eating program because of the way I am feeling.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It is kinda like losing a good friend. After so many years of having another book to look forward to it is a little sad knowing there will be no more.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|The concert from 88, I was waiting all this time! This is one the best Iron Maiden shows I ever seen. Maiden England is still relevant to date. Sadly, is only available on DVD. I gave it five stars, but it's actually 4.5, because the video is not that sharp. But still a great addition to your library, it's worth it.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This album is just brilliant. I've listened to it 25+ times and it only gets better with more listens. Basically I love this :) And instead of reading Amazon reviews, just buy it!
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Iron Maiden stands the test of time. One of the best Metal Groups in history, this cd is killers. Recorded in 1988, as part of the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son tour, after two successful world tours, they decided to do a concept album. This two cd album, comes complete with all the classic songs you expect from Maiden, plus the &#34;seventh songs&#34;. The remaster sounds great. Go pick it up before they release the next one.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|What I have used, I like. I'm on a kindle fire HD, and can't find any of the setting. I really wanted to password lock my notebook, but that is missing, as are the rest of the settings. Once that is fixed, this will be getting five stars.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Came in store quality packaging. I hate when you get flimsy cases or with different covers as the store. Delivered fast and had no scratches or skipping. That's pretty much all you can ask for.

159463176X|5.0|\\"Adel was not too naïve to know that the world was a fundamentally unfair place; he only had to gaze out the window of his bedroom.\\" (pg 204)<br /><br /> Hosseini opens with a story, told by a father to his two children, that portends the tragic fate of these two siblings in the years ahead.  Rather than a linear narrative, this ambitious effort structures the tale through various point of views, each chapter serving as a short story for a character whose life intersects at varying degrees along the continuum to weave together 60 years after which the original story finally comes full circle.<br /><br />Okay - After waiting painstakingly for six long years for another Hosseini novel, I went to bed early the night of the 20th and woke up at midnight to download it as soon as the calendar changed to May 21st to get started.  My rule for a favorite author is to have read at least three of his/her works and to adore all of them.  Hosseini has now officially passed the threshold for me.  But, I think the reviews will be mixed for his latest work.  There seems to be an interesting evolution in his work, or maybe it is in him as an author.  His first two works could only take place within the context of Afghanistan's history.  With the Kite Runner it seemed Hosseini felt a need to relate the country's history, successfully I might add, - both the beauty of the country pre-Russian invasion and the devastation thereafter, while A Thousand Splendid Suns dealt with a more current climate even though both were done so through well drawn characters in complex relationships.  In his latest work, focused on sibling relationships, the setting, while some interesting historical nuggets are mentioned,  is really irrelevant.  It is completely reliant upon the characters and the relationships.  In my opinion, it is evidence that Hosseini is an author that is, hopefully, here to stay.  So, I would caution the reader against the temptation to compare it to his previous works.  That is not to say you won't find Hosseini within.  With Hosseini you know you are going to have your heart broken, and it will be broken multiple times here.  You also know that, while you may have resolution, you will not have neatly tied up happily ever after endings.  If you loved his previous work for his ability to paint a picture with words and his ability to speak universally to human emotion and shortcomings you will not be disappointed here.<br /><br />Some favorite passages:<br /><br />\\"I proceeded with a mostly clean conscience, and with the conviction that my proposal was born of goodwill and honest intentions.  Something that, though painful in the short term, would lead to a greater long-term good for all involved.  But I had less honorable, self-serving motives as well.\\" (pg 83)<br /><br /> \\"For the first time, Adel felt truly aware of the broader movements that had always governed his life. And of the wildly conflicting truths that resided within a person. Not just in his father, or his mother, or Kabir.  But within himself too.\\" (pg 209 )<br /><br /> \\"I suspect the truth is that we are waiting, all of us, against insurmountable odds, for something extraordinary to happen to us.\\" (pg. 86)<br /><br />\\"One thing I have come to see is that one is well served by a degree of both humility and charity when judging the inner workings of another person's heart.\\" (pg. 89)ot to say you won't find Hosseini within.

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is a favorite! Evan though I love this game, I found the price too steep. I was able to purchase the game with free coins from Amazon so the game did not cost me any money, which I was really excited about. The game played great on my Kindle Fire with no problems. You can play this for hours, not short like so many other games. I have been very disappointed in many of the games but this is not one of them! I will definently buy more of these games when they are more reasonably priced!
1609611543|3.0|it is more difficult to accomplish than we expected. Keep wheat free can turn into a full time job, thus making it less likely for us to pursue.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I watched this movie because I really like Rebel Wilson...but I found that everyone I this movie is amazing.  Such a great movie.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It was a good game but it could be longer.And the last part of the video is not on the game.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|When your 16 year old musician daughter likes it as much as you do, maybe it is good stuff.  I think what got her interested was watching a young Stephen Stills sing 4 and 20 on the Dick Cavett show on YouTube.  I saw Stephen Stills fall off the stage of the now gone Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh in 1986, and swore I would never listen to him again.  I am glad the human condition allows for forgiveness, because I have seen Stills since that appearance many times, and he has been great, although his voice admittedly has paid the price for a lifetime of Jack Daniel's and cocaine.  Listening to this legend's voice and always incredible guitar playing in prime time makes this four disc set well worth the price.  A few weak songs, but more classics than you can count.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My daughter really likes this mobile. The music is all classical (for kids), which isn't as annoying to listen to as some other Fisher Price &#34;songs.&#34; There is also a &#34;rainforest noises&#34; option. The figures are colorful and fun to look at, and the music lasts a long time (not to mention there is a remote in case it stops). Sometimes my baby can watch it for a good 10-15 mins and not get bored. Visually not the prettiest thing, but if you are considering buying this, chances are it's about utility and needing to entertain your baby no matter what. Easily attaches to a regular crib. Easy assembly as well.

B000006YO2|5.0|While I have heard Roxy/Ferry music through the years, I never went out of my way to<br />buy one of their CD's until I heard their version of \\"I put a spell on you\\".<br />Up to this point, I always thought that Creedence had the best version, but Ferry just<br />blows them away!<br />The drum riffs on this version are without a doubt the best I have ever heard, and I am a<br />professional drummer with over 45 years of experience behind me.<br />It's nice to rediscover the older groups again that were true musicians, and not just the<br />next copy cat of a wannabe!
B005S9ELY4|5.0|Can't believe people still take the critics seriously. Sean Penn turned in an amazing performance in this movie. Too bad the Academy will never recognize it because it isn't their kind of movie. I will admit, this wasn't an Academy Award winning movie, but Sean Penn was the best thing about it. He was a realistic villain. His performance was realistic and had depth. The plot was a tad thin, perhaps unoriginal, but well-done and promising for all involved. If you're not a snob, give this film a chance and enjoy. Some people can't enjoy a movie unless the critics do as well. Screw them, this was great. Enjoy.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|I didn't watch when it was on TV, so glad to be a Prime Member - I really missed out! This show is great.
B004L03B3S|5.0|At first, it is hard to believe that two brothers could have this kind of passion for each other. Most brothers suffer from various degrees of sibling rivalry and jealousy. But, just has these passions exist, perhaps to extreme opposite does as well. I suppose and open mind is the policy here.  At any rate, a first hand performance by the two actors.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie; it wasn't as good as the first Iron Man, but it was fun to watch.  We mainly wanted to catch up on the series so we can watch the Avengers and Iron Man 3.  Robert D. Jr. is one of our favorite actors, and he does a good job in this role.  Certainly worth the rental fee.  I would recommend.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The Spartacus saga continues to be fascinating and captivating.  The characters play out their lives in a fashion that is perfectly believable.  The realism of life at that time with all of the ugly, barbarism, cruelty, savagery, and lust of all kinds is not sparred...Bravo to the cast and crew.  One can fully understand why Rome fell pray to the Mongols and hordes of later years. The Romans became totally corrupt and self absorbed.....
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We love to bust this game out and play with our friends! we even got the 5-6 player expansion , catan parties are the best!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Just like Obama, Ralph must wreck everything he sees.  Obama's hands aren't as big as Ralph's hands though.  Great movie.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Movies can have such an impact for good in our lives.  Why aren't more like Lincoln created?  I loved this movie!  Daniel-Day Lewis had me convinced he was Lincoln!  I'm so grateful to the Lincoln family in our country's history.  And Mary Todd sacrificed much as well.  She wasn't insane in my opinion but had a few deserved nervous breakdowns!  I will do all I can to support worthwhile movies like this one.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Like many, I was a bit turned off by the constant playing of Thriftshop on the radio.  The Heist is much more and has some strong substance/lyrics.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|You may feel a little creepy when you start reading this book about a young woman who was abducted and has spent years in an 11x11 foot room, most of them with the child she delivered there. I started reading it only days after the recent discovery of three women, one with a child, in the same situation in Cleveland, Ohio. But stick with it - it's worth it! Told through the eyes the child, it expresses the love and innocence he has for the situation. You never directly see any sex or violence. And soon enough the scene changes. While still told from the child's point of view, we begin to understand the mother's fierce love of her little boy, the sacrifices and clever life she made for him, and the strength and solace he gave her. The author manages a five year old's voice without having it grate on the reader's nerves and she ends the book at just the right time, on just the right upbeat note. The minor characters are real, some endearing - warts, foibles and all. This was definitely a gratifying and pleasurable experience.
B00BS7HNTK|4.0|I bought this because I will be seeing them with Mumford and I wanted to familiarize myself with their music prior to the show.  While there are ups and downs, the music is generally catch and easy to listen to.  Looking forward to the show!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was a really good game but not very long. It was pretty easy to figure out what was goin on though.
B000V63BWW|5.0|This is what I call music, it actually makes you think. I am so glad that I could purchase this for this price.  I plan on giving this to my grandson for his birthday, so that he understands the meaning of the term an oldie but a goodie
B000VNMMQG|5.0|How amazing to see what this man went through to stop slave trade. It could likely be compared to the fight that the pro lifers are facing in the abortion arena. It certainly is similar in terms of the denigration of human life. These two awful and hideous atrocities are also similar in terms of the politics that keep them going.<br />I was pleased to get a glimpse of John Newton and see how he viewed his sin.... That seems to me how genuine Christians are to be humbled by their sin. Yeah, all of us don't sin on that scale, but even little sins against an infinitely holy God, are significantly weighty.
B000VH4OCW|5.0|Stevie Wonder's music has always been a part of my life growing up and I am so glad that I can listening to the music that I grew up with.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Great characters and acting. This is an passionately intense movie that takes place at an exciting time in the nation, but a very threatening time internationally. I have viewed it a few times and likely will view it again.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|If you didn't know who the man in black was..  No better time to learn and do it by watching this film!
0783233477|2.0|I like Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, and when I initially viewed this movie, I thought it was fascinating. However, after I was saved in 2004 and having since read and listened through the Bible numerous times, I find the movie not worthy of watching because it portrays heavenly matters in a frivolous manner. Read the Bible and find out just how ridiculous such movies are, they likely tempt God to anger.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Better than I expected. It was a great way to pass time during my flight. If you have a kindle and want to watch it during the flight you will need to download it to your kindle and disable wifi so it won't try to pick up the wifi that you would need to purchase  from the airline.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book is too medical.  *I wanted to read what he saw and how he felt going through this experience.  This was such<br />a disappointment.  I skipped over quite a few pages.
B000000OQF|5.0|going back in time a little here. i was 14 when this came out and its all i listened to for quite sometime. great album, axle is a douche but this was kick ass.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This is perfect for my Canon Rebel and it fits it perfectly. The padding is also awesome and protects it from any bumps. This is perfect for when you don't want to carry something bulky.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I have wasted hours on this game and enjoyed every minute. I like being able to win extra points. It can sometimes be a challenge to win them. I play on Adventure mode but you can play tournamentes or continuous also. You win points to build a village. The colors are clear and rich. Easy on the eyes. Worth the 2 bucks.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|been playing a bit every few days for a couple weeks now. I don't know what the point is. jusr a huge time waster
B000FC12L4|5.0|One of my favorite books - I recommend it for any age level. I first read this book when I was 12 and after re-reading it at 23 I can guarantee that it gets even more enjoyable after reaching adulthood.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game if your a fan of the SimCity games. kinda slow and you tend to have to wait to get money.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Awesome game play. I would buy this game a million times over!!! So addictive I can't put it down. Easy to play my five year old just loves it! I believe you guys have out done urself on this one. Great job!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I think it's is a great app and that people should definitely try it! You also might try the pro version of you like it!
0785156593|5.0|I got into comics because of the character in this book. Thanos is this &#34;god&#34; who wants to please his love interest, death. So to please her he kills. He is so powerful that the whole marvel universe has to get involved to stop him. It's a great read.
0375851569|5.0|Loved how it was all individual books. Exactly what I was looking for. Gave it to a friend at a baby shower and they thoroughly appreciated it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of my favorites by Nicholas sparks. Great read; a little intense at times, but worth it. 5 stars for sure
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I read it from start to finish in one go. I loved reconnecting with Rebus, Clarke, Cafferty, and a raft of new characters in a neatly plotted mystery.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I really enjoyed the graphics and story line. I think it showed in a lighter vein where technology could take us.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I borrowed this book from the library, I had no idea what I was getting into. From first to last, this book demonstrated how words can be transformed into art. Five stars aren't enough.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger steals books. Considering what else is going on in Nazi Germany, this might seem a small crime, but leads to a great story narrated by Death. We become immersed into the lives of Liesel and her neighbours, including the Jew hiding in her basement.<br /><br />Markus Zusak spins words with all the mastery of a spider spinning its web, catching the reader in gorgeous, richly layered and poetic imagery and emotion. Ten stars and all my recommendations.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma had me from the beginning. I have not read too many books that the whole story is told from the guys POV. It was such a change for me and I loved it! Most girls are sappy, sad, may even be a little whiney when they tell their story. Drew on the other hand was real! I loved the way the author had Drew stop in the middle of something and would say \\" I know what you are thinking. Don't shoot the messenger.\\" He cracked me up. I loved to hate Drew in the book. He was HAWT and he knew it. Never had to convince a girl to spend a night with him. Only one night to rock their world and then he was done. He never \\"rode\\" the same roller coaster twice. Until Kate Brooks made him feel things he never knew existed. Of course she would be off-limits, she is engaged. But Drew knows she feels it to and he wants her, he wants her bad! Kate is independent and has worked hard to be where she is at in life. She can see right through Drew's sexy smile and charm and she isn't afraid to tell him like it is. Read this book, you will fall in love with the story! I give this book 5 stars!<br /><br />-Harper<br /><br />Talk about knocking it out of the park! Emma kicked ass with this book!!! Drew's POV was so freaking awesome! I was laughing through most of the book thinking \\"yeah really, that is how guys think!\\" She was able to tell such a great love story with good humor, sexy love scenes and a perfect amount of angst... Drew is friggen hotter than hell in my mind, and if the guy I worked with was 1/2 as cute as Drew is in this book I would march right into his office and find a reason to fight with him (sadly he is NOT!). Reading about Kate from Drews POV also made me really enjoy her. I thoroughly enjoyed reading how Drew was going to attempt to go after an unavailable woman even though he was breaking every rule in the process. The fact that she could see right through his sly routine make me enjoy her even more!!! This book needs to be at the top of your TBR list ASAP!!! I give this book 5+ stars!<br /><br />-Cam<br /><br />Emma Chase....Tangled was....FANTASTIC!!!! I loved Drew and I loved that the story was told from his point of view.  It was so refreshing!! I also really enjoyed the fact that Drew is basically \\"talking\\" to the reader and telling his story.  It was perfect. It was nice to have a book that was hilarious (I may of even pee'd myself while reading the part where Mackenzie talks about Bagina's), sexy (I want Drew!), relatable (no I do not work with a HOT man I want to jump, a girl can dream but I do relate to a lot in the story) and all in all a great love story.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, good story, plot line, nice and engaging... then... notta...That was the dissapointment that the ending was anti-climatic.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I would really love to say that the ending was horrible and Mrs Harris needs to write one more to redeem herself, but I cant.  This book brought back all my favorite characters, even if just for a short time, and gave finality to the story.  Although I certainly hope to be able to read just a little more about Sookie in the future, I am pleased with how the series ended.

B00BDSRISA|5.0|This album is sure to please any Phoenix fan, a little old sound w/ some new-ish. I Love it FA SHO!! BUY IT NOW
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|The comfort and warmth of Agnetha's sweet voice is pure pleasure. I gave the album 4 stars because there's only a couple of songs I don't care for, especially the duet. Best tracks 1,2,3,5,7&.8. This is an album for people who appreciate good melodic singing,which is almost a lost art form.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Here's why: The graphics are terrible; the controls are bad; and why does it have to cost $7.00? Plus; I deleted this three times! DON'T GET
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I don't want to be  verbose, as there are almost 100 other reviews (as of this writing)that reflect my opinion of this album. I'm glad Rod Stewart is over the \\"Songbook\\" phase, as I think his voice is ill suited to that type of music. On this release, Rod is back to well crafted  pop/rock/ballads that showcase his rugged and vibrant voice perfectly. At times, the musical arrangements harken back to his early days. Listen carefully and you'll here a little mandolin, vintage organ and fiddle here and there. The masterful Rod Stewart has kicked off his second act in a magnificent way.He puts 95% of modern artists to shame. This is how its done kids!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Movie is better than the first time I saw it in Cambridge, Mass in the year 1957, while getting schooled.<br /><br />I have the non-Blue DVD.  With an outdoor movie like parts of this, the Blu-Ray is superior.<br /><br />That supposes you can handle a serious role for Leslie Nielsen.  Just remember the movie was released in 1956, so Nielsen is younger than when in &#34;Naked Gun 33 1/3&#34;.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love everything about the supernatural series. I will buy the next  one when it comes out also.<br />Thank you.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|If this game isn't crashing then it is a slow grind to try and earn jems to buy important needed items.  Almost impossible amounts are needed to earn so you are forced to resort to buying them. And that is when the greed of gameloft is apparent. If you want to kill some time and see the ponies from hub enjoy, but you won't for very long.
B005CWRB44|5.0|Got this because I ended up losing something in a huge baseball field just before sun down and realized just how useful a pocket flashlight would have been. I have to say the amount of light that comes out of this little thing is intense, it's extremely bright and the fact that it has 3 different settings is awesome as it allows for different scenarios and preserves battery life. The construction of this thing is great and extremely durable. Overall a great little flashlight, would highly recommend it.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Have not played it yet, but my grandaughter love to play this game so it is for her to have fun with.
B002NT3B52|4.0|Example:  For dogs, posture can announce aggressive intent or shrinking modesty ...  even hair, the hackles, can serve as a visual signal.<br />The book discusses senses such as smell, hearing, and vision.<br />Insightful and informative.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its alot of fun and I love to play this game alot because it is a neat game and lots of fun.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft droids bring life back to music. If you want real music and not the fluff that everybody is putting out these days, try this from a fresh perspective and you would be blown away! Audiophiles nirvana! Sound is full and silky smooth, the one that demands listening over and over. Every song is unbelievable and uniquely good. It's all great stuff here. Like one reviewer said, in the pervious albums, there were only one or two songs to write home about but this is an amazing album that should be enjoyed as a whole album and not as singles! DAFT PUNK has done the  incredible in this album and would be treasured for years to come. This is the sound of future with a soul of the past...
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|I am always captivated with the unusual. I was intrigued from the first page and this book, with this strange human element pulled you in and would not let you go.  Think of the possibility of changing the very core, your soul.  Would you be able to resist greed, power,cruelty? If you could change your essence, would you?
B005K17RU0|2.0|This app used to be serviceable and somewhat well-organized, but now it is a sprawling mess. Good thing there's other apps oh there.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a simple story about Drew, a rich spoiled playboy, who falls for his colleague Kate, a smart beautiful girl who doesn't fall easily to his charms. There is no drama, heartbreak, cliffhanger, danger, intrigue, etc. Why do I love this book?? It is written entirely from Drew's point of view - he is absolutely hilarious but most definitely a tool!! Maybe some of my other book boyfriends are the same way but I don't hear their inner monologues. Drew only wants women for sex & he is very blunt & unapologetic about it. Loving Kate throws him for a loop & he makes several mistakes in the process of winning her. Their chemistry together is very hot & that seals the deal, even though Drew is surprised at how much he wants to be with Kate. Drew goes to dramatic lengths to show Kate he really cares for her but there is a part of her that believes his infatuation won't last. So at this point it is still just a nice story & I'm wondering why everyone is raving about it. The ending is what clinches the whole book - Drew draws war strategies from Braveheart to try to win Kate back which is so funny but in the end he steals a move from the movie The Notebook, making a grand gesture to prove he respects Kate & wants her for a long-term relationship. Sigh...so very sweet & he stole my heart! Drew is hilarious & dirty & completely a guy but he has a heart of gold & would do anything for Kate!

B008B1BL4E|4.0|This is another book that I picked up after listening to the author being interviewed on NPR.  I was intrigued and found the author's mix of social history and close review of material resulted in a outstanding history.  If you think you're familiar with the road to war before World War I, you need to pickup this book.  The activities of decision makers in each nation or empire sheds new light to the seasoned student of this subject.  People who study foreign policy will be astounded at the assumptions made and the policies each country undertook before the war.  Clark brings it all together to explain how diplomacy failed and dogs of war were unleashed.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I am 72 years old. I read the book in light of recommending it to grandchildren. I enjoyed it almost as much as Grisham's regular adult books. He did a great job with family and friend issues. He kept the interest high with conflict over keeping promises and yet doing what was right. Theo is the kind of kid anyone would want for a friend, a son or a grandson. I plan to read the entire series and recommend them to youngsters I know.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not predictable--lots of twists and turns. I love time travel stories but they have to be believable even though you know they could never happen. This is so believable it draws the reader right in. I love being brought back to 1958 through the senses --reminding me of the way things looked, smelled, tasted!

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was less than steler for me as it took too long to begin understanding which direction the book was taking.  After several boring chapters, the book did begin to pick up.  It is a mystery novel that has many turns and twists.
B007L6VR12|5.0|just finished watching Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, which is, hands down, one of the most whimsical, magical films I've encountered in many moons. An Anderson fan, I hesitated to see this when it was released as mixed reviews (which usually happens in Anderson films anyway) many discounting it as \\"a series of poses and postures\\" often singling out the \\"awful\\" acting of the two leads discouraged me. Well, I was a silly goose, and those critics, as earnest as they may have been, couldn't have been more wrong in describing this thing if they'd tried.<br /><br />The leading couple, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) are a pair of emotionally challenged 12 year olds who fall in love during a performance of Britten's Noye's Fludde. I couldn't imagine either role cast better than here, nor more nuanced performances coaxed by a director who actually \\"gets\\" kids - particularly troubled ones. The story begins when Sam, a highly decorated, though not well liked cadet Sam flees the confines of Camp Ivanhoe and his Khaki Troop (think Boy Scouts of America) to run away with unpredictable and misunderstood Suzy. Their inventory for survival includes a kitten in a basket (with accompanying cans of gourmet cat food), a battery operated record player and a suitcase full of stolen library books. My kind of kids. Living on a remote island (about to be hit by the storm of the century) they can't really escape far . . . or can they? Through (several) ensuing chases, unsuccessful captures, and re-escapes the story grows exponentially, layer by layer as it introduces us to the foibles, quirks and ticks of the residents as our Island Romeo and Juliet explore their burgeoning sexuality (all tastefully within the confines of its PG-13 rating).<br /><br />Speaking of Noye's Fludde, Anderson had me from the start, as any movie that bookends its opening and closing scenes with Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, has already got plenty going for it! And Britten's music (in addition to large chunks of Noye) looms large throughout, as does that of Schubert (An die Musick), Mozart (Cosi's Soave sia il vento) Saint Saëns (Carnival of the Animals) and Hank Williams. So, too, does the score by composer Alexandre Desplat who pays tribute to Britten (remarkably directly in the closing credits, where his own \\"Guide to the Orchestra\\" is narrated by the film's hero).  Rarely does one find film music these days that is this integrally bound to the storytelling that it's virtually impossible to imagine the story without it.<br /><br />Anderson sets his tale circa 1965 on the fictional New England island of New Penzance. The nod to Gilbert and Sullivan is here more dramatic than musical, but nonetheless unmistakable. The parallels between Moonrise's young Sam, and Pirates' Frederic are plentiful. While entirely original, Moonrise nonetheless feels punctuated throughout as it evokes gauze-covered memories of other things. It was constantly conjuring fleeting instances causing my mind to race to discover connections between it and Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, The Keystone Cops, Lord of the Flies, and more. Robert D. Yeoman's remarkably nuanced cinematography makes every frame look like a page from an old family photo album, capturing summer camp, skinned knees and emotional secrets barely covered through veils of thin smiles. Moonrise Kingdom, indeed.<br /><br />Though Sam and Suzy are the heart of the film, Moonrise is truly an ensemble piece and Anderson is able to evoke marvelous, sometimes larger than life, performances from an inspired cast of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel and Bob Baliban (who serves as narrator/Greek Chorus), and all of whom create the believable, quirky, characters who populate this magical island town.<br /><br />In my estimation critics who found this \\"stifling\\" simply are never going to like films made by the likes of Mr. Anderson, directorswho essentially eschew The Hollywood Way, as they put out beautiful, boutique films for small audiences willing (or wishing) to escape into the fantastic worlds they've created for us. For those not willing to do so, I suppose these films really can be, as one critic described Moonrise \\"a long, dull exercise in alternative comedy.\\" For the rest of us . . . it's a dream.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|this is the cheapest film we have ever ever bought or used for polaroid the original polaroid is outstanding of course
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The characters are complex and interesting and the plot development has me hooked... I am ready for the rest of the story!!
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The great movie that relates to real life in a humorous way. If you can't laugh at life's ups and downs then what's the point?
0891419063|5.0|This was the second time i have read this book...and in a couple years, i may read it again...Mr. Sledge tells his tale with great skill and sensitivity...the definitive book on island warfare.....
0857680986|2.0|This is a book you discover at sixteen and find amazing and fruitful. As your knowledge, taste and aesthetic sense grow this book becomes increasingly obsolete.<br />The drawings have a late 30's, early 40's sensibility that can be almost painful to look at now. The gestures are stagey, the rendering glib, and the bodies cartoonish in their idealization. Great for retro comic artists, not much good fro a serious student of anatomy, and worthless for the aesthetics of graceful and expressive drawing.<br />For comparison look at Sherrie McGraw, who is sublime.<br />A curiosity on a bookshelf, nostalgic illustrators might still like Loomis.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was so well made! I just loved it! I went out a bought it right away! You wont be disappointed with this movie.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I absolutely love this game. very easy to play and even if you don't want to make in game purchases, you can still actually play the game completely.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie was just confusing. I could have tried watching it a few times but I didn't feel like it.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|Brilliant. Keep listening to it over and over. This is one of Van Morrisons best albums  I find Van Morrisons soulful voice relaxing and upbeat all at the same time. I highly recommend this album
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one! What an adventure Mr. Martin took me on. Couldn't put the book down. Finished at 3:15am... was worth losing sleep. The book never lagged.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Compelling. Intense. Emotional. Brilliant.<br /><br />Let me just say that I am not the type of person to describe a movie as \\"brilliant\\" but that's all I could think walking out of this movie!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />-The plot was smart and entertaining. Not quite something we've never seen before, but it's still really well crafted. J.J. Abrams proves once again he is a great story teller when it comes to directing. Summary: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is struggling with his responsibilities as captain. But When Starfleet is attacked by one of their own (Benedict Cumberbatch) Kirk must prove if he truly has what it takes to command The Enterprise, and if his crew can find the terrorist and bring him to justice. I know a lot of hard core Trekkies are thinking \\"Oh, great, Star Trek has become a simple popcorn flick\\". Don't worry, plenty of twists and turns (along with a few Easter Eggs and nods to the original series).<br /><br />-Acting is absolutely perfect. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and the rest of the Enterprise cast all give great performances as the iconic crew. Newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch steals every scene he is in, giving an impressive (and intimidating) performance as the film's villain, John Harrison. There are no bad performances in the movie.<br /><br />-Effects are incredible. The action is exhilarating while enhanced by the 3D. The CGI is great, but the impressive set designs and practical effects should not be overlooked.<br /><br />-Very fast pacing, not a dull moment here. despite the film's length, it goes by pretty fast. Very entertaining beginning to end.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />-Pacing is great, but probably TOO fast. There should be at least a few more minutes in the middle to give audiences time to breathe! Probably one are two more action sequences than there needs to be (although they are all fantastic and well done).<br /><br />-Too much lens flare. It works for a lot of the movie, but is seriously over used. Itcan be pretty distracting from what's going on at times.<br /><br />Overall, there are very few problems with the movie (for me). There are certain twists that take the movie back to source material from the original series, which work really well. There are also certain events from other Star Trek movies that, in a way, repeat themselves in this story. I wouldn't call this a remake, cause this is a new series that takes place in an alternate timeline, due to the time travel that occurred in the first movie from 2009. Point is, some of theses \\"events\\" that repeat themselves some fans will love, others will hate. Again, there are certain parts of the film (for the hard core Trekkies) that will be hit or miss.<br /><br />As a casual fan of the Star Trek franchise, I loved this movie. Not ALL of the throwbacks to classic Star Trek work, but I at least appreciated them. This isn't just an entertaining action movie, it's a good movie in general. It doesn't quite go where no Star Trek movie has gone before, but it's still one heck of a ride.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! It is very entertaining and my 3 year olds likes to play too. I only wish it didn't require neighbors to complete tasks.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Jazz is my fav era and this movie just makes it that much better. Had this when I was younger but lost it or ruined it. Good to go back and remember and sing along to all the songs.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|Doug Aldrich is back and has revived Burning Rain after stints with Dio and Whitesnake (where he's still a member) and hasn't missed a beat. This CD should appeal to fans of the bands first two CD's as well as anyone into Whitesnake from 1987 onward, Lynch Mob's 'Wicked Sensation\\", or Bulletboys' \\"Freakshow\\". Production is top shelf with lots of energy in the music and it's all especially interesting if you're a guitar player. Aldrich's style is like a hybrid of classic bluesy rock playing mixed with 80's LA Hard Rock gymnastics and energy. Almost all the tracks are keepers, the weakest tracks to me are \\"Sweet Little Baby Thing\\" and \\"Ride The Monkey\\" which both smoke musically, but suffer from silly lyrics, and \\"When Can I Believe In Love\\" which ventures uncomfortably close to cheesy/scmaltzy territory for a ballad. Everything else works very well to me including a surprisingly good cover of Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\". This could very well be the best hard rock CD of 2013 and I sincerely doubt any fan of the genre will regret picking this up.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Had this when I was younger but lost it or ruined it. Good to go back and remember the romance and sing along to all the songs. Makes me want to take a burlesque class or something. :)
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My kids and both really enjoyed this book! Rick Riordan truly tells stories that capture the imagination. I can hardly wait for what he does next.
B002APU580|5.0|This is one of my favs books and movies. Other than the stuttering of &#34;I love you&#34; where you can almost feel the dumb at the end, the acting is the best!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Overall, it had a great tone and atmosphere, but I found the storyline suffered near the end. The last episode didn't really entirely suit the tone the series began with.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it!  There are so many good recipes and ideas. I used Pinterest for all my kids birthdays this year, my husbands b-day, a backyard movie night.  Lots of cute cupcake ideas. And I love all the home ideas - decorating, organizing, etc. I am addicted to this site and have to limit my time or I will get nothing else done!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just like the series. And it was good to be able to download from Amazon. It was a good first time experience.
B008CYDD7I|5.0|The true test of friendship, for me, is being able to show someone Re-Animator and not have them ask me to turn it off. It's a truly outrageous movie in almost every way, full of over-the-top makeup effects, nudity,and gore. I love every second of it, largely thanks to a surprising amount of dark wit in the script as well as Jeffrey Combs' delightfully fiendish performance. It's not a classic if we're being objective, but it is genuinely good and not as stupid as you'd think. If you like this there's definitely a heritage that carried over into the producer's later films like Puppet Master. It's not as clever, though: Re-Animator stands alone in its weirdly successful combination of smarts and idiocy.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Great for watching pre new years eve. Gets you in the mode and spirits. I have watched it for 2 years in a roll. play it between 7-8pm done by 9pm I am starting to celebrate, coming into the new years, it all falls together.... Unless I am in Vegas, then I'll be on the stripe!!!
B000H1RFKA|5.0|I can't recommend this movie enough to people I meet.  It's fast, witty dialogue is spot on and Downey and Kilmer are brilliant together.  The moment I finished it for the first time I immediately started it again to try and catch more of he wit and humor.  I still find something new each time I watch it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|For lover's of the fabulous animation being done these days, this movie is on top of that world. AND, the storyline is pretty good, too, although you must have a great sense of fantacy in you.
B00C061I3K|2.0|I have been a fan of all music for my entire life.  classical-modern era, every genre.  I have an appreciation for it all.  I play several instruments and have been a dj in the electronic music scene since 1997 playing all forms of electronica from deep house to hardstyle and everything in between.  I am also very into production and sound engineering.  With all this being said, i remember the first time i heard daft punk and was AMAZED.  They are one of the reasons i became hooked on the house/french house sound (roule records, crydamoure, le knight club), I was perfectly accepting of the tracks they released that sounded nothing like \\"Daft Punk\\" because it was still masterful electronica even though it wasnt as amazing as a \\"Daft Punk\\" floor filler.  I have literally waited years for this album (close to a decade).  I was disappointed with the tron soundtrack, however i knew not to expect it to be remotely close to a true Daft Punk studio release since it was for a film.  I appreciated the music, listened to it about 10 times and discarded it from my memory banks.  I literally just found out this album was out, immediately bought it and here is my take.<br /><br />WOW ... its .... TERRIBLE.  I mean seriously, its completely subjective so do not bash me for having an opinion.  If you are a daft punk fan, if you like their sub labels they created, or the tracks bangalter released on his own, even if you liked the tron soundtrack I urge you to not make the same mistake I did.  PLEASE LISTEN TO SAMPLES OF IT BEFORE YOU BUY.  It sounds nothing like any of their former music under any label or any other names they have used.  The production quality is ungodly.  Truly amazing.  That being said, even the production value and amazing \\"sound engineering\\" used to create the album could not save it from the lackluster, and extremely boring songs on the cd.  Its truly a SAD SAD SAD day when the best track on a daft punk cd has a mega star doing the vocals on it, and was clearly made just for radio play.  I understand artists grow, evolve, change and fans can chose to do the same or look elsewhere for music they like.  Im just disappointed i waited so many years for such little enjoyment.  This is literally the only record I have been anticipating being released since they dropped their last cd, and i am trying so hard to FORCE myself to like SOMETHING about the tracks, and unfortunately its just not happening. Well i hope others enjoy it, I hope fans of this genre (seemingly a very very niche genre) who have maybe never heard of Daft Punk like it, I however think its the single biggest let down in the history of electronica and possibly any release I have anticipated my whole life of loving music.  I never write reviews, but i felt it necessary to warn people..<br /><br />PLEASE LISTEN TO SAMPLES OF TRACKS BEFORE YOU BUY... dont fall victim to thinking the \\"Daft Punk\\" name will carry this CD and the die hard fans of their sound (no matter what names or label they released tracks under that you may have liked) will get at LEAST one track in the vein they are used to or enjoyed .. because sadly... it does not happen.

B00CEB5QU2|5.0|2014-09-23 update: Firmware and software updates have fixed all the issues and my MobileLite(s) now work problem free. I really like this device and at the low current prices they're a steal, just bought two more, they're so handy to have around. Very portable and useful. Especially if you need to share files between multiple devices. I can access from 2-3 devices at once without any problems and stream video, play music, copy files, and so on. Access may seem hesitant as you navigate, now and then, but the streaming is fast and never buffers or lags. Even HD videos play well. See below, after the original review, for another update with tips, especially an easy way to access from windows which made this device much more useful to me. Have now raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars based on excellent features, performance, and value.<br /><br />Original review:<br />----------------<br />Ok, so this is a very well built and nicely designed bit of hardware that delivers what it promises.  It is let down only by the mildly flaky MobileLite app (but it works well most of the time) and too brief documentation/instructions.<br /><br />The quick start guide is sufficient to get you going, but leaves many questions unanswered.  Nevertheless, you can easily charge the device, pop in an SD card (or USB flash drive), download the Mobilite app and install it on your device (I used a Samsung Galaxy Player for this review) and in short order you will be accessing your content on your Mobile device or the MobileLite easily.<br /><br />When plugged into your laptop to charge, you can also access the storage (SD Card or USB) and copy content back and forth, view/play content and so on.  So your basic USB storage device.  Unplug and power it up and you have a portable wifi storage device.  And as a little bonus, you can also use it as a backup power source for your phone or other USB chargeable device.<br /><br />I was able to play music, watch videos, and view photos from the MobileLite on my tablet using the app without any problems.  In use there have been a few times when the app froze and had to be forced to close.  This is fairly typical for these apps, unfortunately.  That said, most of the time it worked fine. The MobileLite app is OK, nothing great, but it gets the job done.<br /><br />I was also able to access the MobileLite from my laptop via Wifi (look for the \\"MobileLite\\" network).  I have not tried the internet pass-through yet, but will.  Others have verified that it works fine.<br /><br />I need to spend some more time playing with this and will come back and update this review, but my first impressions are good.  It is an attractive, light, very portable device which will allow your phones, tablets, and other devices to access the SD card or USB memory you can insert into the device.  Good for 'off the cuff\\" content and for sharing content with multiple devices.  For the relatively low price, I think it's a good value if you need a portable wifi storage device.<br /><br />Update:  Dropped this about 3 feet onto a hard tile floor and it survived without a scratch and works fine still.  I am posting a screen shot showing how it appears in Windows 7 (Pro) under \\"Network\\" -- very easy to access, and Media Player will handle it fine.  You can also access the contents of the SD, USB, or whatever directly of course.  Music, Photos, Videos all play well, no issues at all.  Can play mp3's while watching a photo slideshow and so on.  Performance seems fine.<br /><br />Very nice for the price!<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />2014-09-24 update -- TIPS (things I've learned and found useful):<br /><br />From a Windows PC you can access the MobileLite storage via a browser (read only) using 192.168.200.254 - great for streaming videos, viewing photos or playing music - and you can also access settings for the device.<br /><br />Even better, for read/write access via PC \\"Network\\" - open Windows Explorer, click on\\"Network\\" - then click to right of \\"Network>\\" in the address bar and type \\"\\mobilelite\\" and press [Enter] and it will mount mobilelite as a network (Samba) share. Now you can move, copy, delete using the explorer window as usual (if you close the window, you have to do this again). You can also create a desktop shortcut to \\"\\mobilelite\\" and access using that (easier). (Took me some time to figure this out. I can't understand why Kingston does not include these instructions.)<br /><br />Also note that the MobileLite will always be automatically listed as a media server under \\"Network\\" and Windows Media Player will access it automatically to play music and videos.ess [Enter] and it will mount mobilelite as a network (Samba) share.

B00AAQWMB4|3.0|This game is very well written and fun to play. Unfortunately, it is just not my type of game. You basically play with certain size pieces and place them corner edge to corner edge without hitting your colors sides. This is being done turn by turn against 3 other opponents that are trying to do the same thing. All the while taking up point space on the board. The player who places the most pieces scores the most points and wins. A game takes about 5 to 10 minutes. If you like games of this type of strategy, this is the game for you. It just wasn't for me.

B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Jennifer Lawrence is stunning and a stunningly great actress. The film...meh. The fact that an essentially boring blue collar jock is also wrestling with mental illness, doesn't automatically make him an interesting character and this character isn't. The talk about this being DeNiro's return to serious acting is unconvincing in light of his performance which I found unbelievable. In his defense i believe he was miscast for the part. He's too &#34;Big&#34; for it. It needed a less high profile and frankly less &#34;present&#34; actor to pull it off.<br />He tends to overpower everyone but Lawrence just by being there. The good part of the story is the portrayal of unconditional love the son receives from his family. That rings true in its desperation, and is not something I've seen a lot of before.

B00C7L4QB4|4.0|Great show but I plugged my laptop into the TV instead of paying $1.99 for that one episode. Who is really paying that much for one episode? That is why capitalism breaks down; to many people not demanding better. But as for the show it does not disappoint. It definitely stays true to the original intent of the book.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed the film Cloud Atlas. While the story line jumps around a bit and can be confusing at first, and the film is quite long, I found it to be exciting and stimulating. Thankfully Amazon Instant rentals are 48 hours which allowed me time to watch it twice. A good approach in my opinion is to watch it straight through, then read a synopsis and watch it again. It may be helpful to use the captions because in the far future scenes the characters speak in a dialect that can be difficult to understand. The makeup jobs in the film are absolutely unbelievable. There are many characters so well made up you do not recognize them. The special effects are great, the plot is fascinating, and the whole movie is just plain enjoyable. It has elements of action, comedy and romance. This film is not for everyone, but I think it will become the subject of film study classes in the near future.

0441013597|4.0|A couple of disclaimers. I am not a sci-fi reader. Also, I was born well after the time of this book's hype. It definitely is what I'd consider an 'epic' book since it encompases so many years, different people and even different planets. The learning curve is not too severe. though there are a lot of outlandish names and terms, you catch on to them quicker than you would with Brothers Karamazov. I liked the book because of how well-written it was and how the style of it has stood up so that it could have been written in 2013. Thought the story and all the treachery was great. I listened to the audibook and could sort of feel where the parts were to forward through, but they were not that many. Overall, a very sound and enjoyable novel.
B0027GGL6W|5.0|A great cast creates the story of the greatest record label of Chicago blues and the voices who make it , Muddy Waters, Etta James, etc.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I wish I could rate this like a million stars. I am a crazy MLP fan, and this game is by far the favorite I have on my kindle fire. The only downer that lowers my one million to 999,999,999 is that the other members of the Elements of Harmony cost a lot of gems, and gems cost a lot of real money.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Not sure he had ever left though! Great album, if a bit reminiscent of earlier work.  His singing is great in spite of the voice not having improved with age
B00992CF6W|5.0|stop whining give mojang a BREACK if you don't like the game then don't level a bad remark... you'll scare off people if there was a 100,000,000,000 star option id do it
B003ASLJO0|5.0|movie was dumb.. It was recommended to me as one of the best movies ever... it's ok, I love Clint... but can't say it was his very best.. don't like the ending!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I seriously loved Drew's foul mouth!! This book was so funny that I actually found myself laughing out loud. Definitely one of my favorite books!!!!!! I can't wait to read another book my this author. She's great! And I also loved that he told the story. You rarely get that in books especially stand alone books. GREAT!!!!!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Again, Harris holds your attention with a fast but good read.  You need to pay attention to the characters once again.  I do recommend this to any Harris fans.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I enjoy this game even though the coins go quick, wish u were allowed more than 40.  Prizes are hard to retrieve being that they seem to be dropped on outside of the ramp.  Otherwise it's fun, fun, fun!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As usual, Kathy Reichs keeps you guessing.  She holds your attention, and this was a fast read - hard to put down.  I highly recommend this to her readers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun even for a beginner. The game gets progressively harder and faster. I have a hard time putting it down.
1936608898|5.0|After undergoing a lengthy treatment for cancer I was ready and needed a change.  I wanted all the nasty chemicals out of my system.  The Whole 30 was the way for me.  I feel better physically and mentally.  Cancer treatment is as much a mind game as it is physical treatment.  Now I know I am doing the best I can for myself.  All the sciencey stuff makes sense so it is easy to wrap your mind around and dive into the program with both feet.  Love the whole process and what it did for me.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Well worth getting this story which is a trilogy itself. Same high quality as Lord of the Rings. Anxious for the next one, I think it comes out before Christmas. Fast delivery.
0743572750|4.0|So glad I decided to listen to the audio version of this book! I had written this series off as too young for me after reading City of Bones. I really enjoyed the audio of City of Ashes. My favorite part was when Jace was talking to Clary while standing in the opening of his bathroom while his shower was running behind him, oh my! Now if only Clary would grow some toughness and speak up when she has something to say I might really enjoy this series fully.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am a huge player of hidden object games. This game was not only a game but a thriller. The hidden objects were fun to find but the mini games were amazing. I just finished the game after 3 days and I am going to start over again. This is like a good book. Never want to get rid of it so you can go back to it time and time again. Graphics were amazing and I definitely am glad I spent the money!!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I wasn't sure that J.J. Abrams and his crew would be able to pull off another success with this franchise.  The 2009 Star Trek reboot was a surprise hit with audiences and critics that no one really saw coming.  When I first saw the trailer for that film I thought I was looking at a last desperate attempt to make Star Trek relevant.  Much to my surprise I ended up applauding at the end of the reboot.  It was fast paced, well-acted, and visually extraordinary- the most entertaining space opera to hit the big screens since the original Star Wars trilogy.  More importantly, it managed to breathe new life into the Star Trek franchise.  Trek was cool, and except for some Trek purists out there, everyone applauded the film.<br /><br />Now 4 years have passed.  There is now a high expectation on a Trek film that was not placed on the 09 entry.  I had my doubts.  Star Trek 2009 was a surprise; a great blockbuster that few saw coming.  Into Darkness rides in four years later and had to meet expectations set by the 09 film...And it did!<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is what a quality summer blockbuster and sequel should be.  It doesn't slow itself down at any points and gets straight to what the audience cares about.  Character development and interactions are handled in such a way that the film never gets boring, and the narrative moves forward without many stalls.  At times I found myself on the edge of the seat, and throughout the entire film I legitimately felt for the characters and wanted to know how the conflict would be resolved.  This movie knows how to take a basic plot and transform it into Grade-A entertainment.<br /><br />We cannot address Into Darkness without discussing its villain.  Many complained about the blue collar villain Nero in the '09 Trek (I personally enjoyed him, but the masses have spoken) and we do get a vastly superior antagonist in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock).  Cumberbatch is a menacing, physically imposing, charismatic figure who easily dominates every scene he appears on screen for.  In other words: everything Nero was not.  Although I think some Trek purists may complain about this character for spoiler related matters I think most viewers will just accept him for the outstanding performance.<br /><br />The only  fault I can think of is that the film isn't any larger in scale than the previous...In fact, given the last one's villain was destroying entire planets, Into Darkness may be somewhat of a step back in scale.  But this movie didn't need to be like The Dark Knight where each film raises the stakes.  As a continuation of a long running franchise Into Darkness is exciting, has genuine humor, suspense, visual spectacle, superb action, and character moments.  It is what every popcorn film should strive to be.<br /><br />Of course, some fans will complain over the emphasis on action over political intrigue and such.  I get it, I love that stuff in the show, but we just have to accept that we're dealing with two different mediums.  If you're going to make a blockbuster movie you have to appeal to the masses, and Abrams Star Trek movies do it incredibly well.<br /><br />If you are one of those Star Trek purists who cannot accept the changes made in the 2009 reboot you're better off steering away from this entry as it will probably give you more to gripe about.  But if you're a casual Trek fan like me who loved the 2009 film you will not be disappointed.ure who easily dominates every scene he appears on screen for.  In other words: everything Nero was not.

0385349947|5.0|Sandberg is smart and inspirational. As a woman in her younger twenties, I can only encourage people in my age group (of all genders) to get a copy and read it. Truly makes you, as the title says, want to &#34;lean in!&#34;
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this app it tells you the level of the battery, life of the battery, and how much time you have to do different things before the battery will need to be charged.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Honestly this book was just what I needed after Hunger Games.  I was mesmerized the whole time. Anyone who loves a good store with action love and a strong woman this is it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My Kindle Fire came without a cable to hook up to my computer. I wanted to do work with a photo app and needed to download photos from my computer to my Kindle. This cable worked perfectly.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary allowed my family and I,  to better understand how our economy and the global economy fell apart.  The DVD presented the facts and a simple explanation of a very complex economical down fall of our nation's and the world's economy.<br />I believe this DVD should be viewed by all high school students and history/economy teachers should provide an analysis of this documentary in their classrooms.  This is a historical subject both in the US and the world and it should be studied, so that it does not happen again !
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book. The series is amazing and the author needs to make more books so I can read them
B00BURWSG6|3.0|Timo Tolkki returns with a new metal opera project. The Land Of New Hope is an interesting album with some excellent performances, but the overall result falls a little short.<br /><br />The ex-Stratovarius mastermind handles the songwriting and plays both the guitars as well as the bass on his latest undertaking. The drumming is handled by the talented Alex Holzwarth (Rhapsody Of Fire), while the keyboards are performed by the virtuosos Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater), Jens Johansson (Stratovarius) and Mikko Harkin (Sonata Arctica). The majority of the vocal duties are assigned to Elize Ryd (Amaranthe) and Rob Rock (Impellitteri). Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Unisonic) sings the epic title track and Russell Allen (Symphony X), Sharon Den Adel (Within Temptation) and Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) share vocals on some songs.<br /><br />The music on offer ranges from double bass driven power metal to melodic hard rock and softer ballads. Some of the songs contain orchestrations and choirs which enable them to sound very big and bombastic. The album sounds homogenous and contains plenty of variety, but only a handful of individual songs manage to shine.<br /><br />The opener \\"Avalanche Anthem\\" starts the album in a very successful manner and is a definite highlight. The intro is fully orchestrated and captivates the listener before exploding into fast and bombastic power metal delight. The rest of the song continues in a mid-tempo melodic metal manner with captivating vocal transitions between Elize Ryd, Russell Allen and Rob Rock. Tolkki provides an impressive guitar solo, while the chorus contains big choirs and is very memorable.<br /><br />\\"In the Name of the Rose\\" is another stand out song with a captivating chorus. It starts in a balladry fashion with some softer singing by Ryd and after the first chorus it switches to a slower tempo rock song carried by Allen.<br /><br />\\"We Will Find a Way\\" sees Rob Rock dueling with Tony Kakko in a successful up-beat melodic metal tune. A heavier keyboard presence, a good chorus and an uplifting Stratovarius vibe round off this effort.<br /><br />\\"I'll Sing You Home\\" is the album's second ballad and it is pretty great. Vocal duties go to the female singer Elize Ryd who crowns this song with one of the most emotional performances on offer.<br /><br />\\"The Land Of New Hope\\" is the longest and probably most epic song on the album. Michael Kiske handles the vocals and he truly makes this song an absolute highlight. This is another orchestral offering with several tempo changes and the most memorable chorus on offer. Michael Kiske delivers one of the most impressive vocal performances of his entire career, displaying plenty of emotion and showcasing his powerful range throughout. A very fitting guitar solo and a wink to the Helloween classic Keeper Of The Seven Keys make this song truly unforgettable.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks fall a little short, due to some unimpressive performances, dull choruses or strong resemblances to Tolkki's past efforts. This is truly unfortunate because there was definitely a lot of potential here that could have resulted in a monumental album.<br /><br />The Land Of New Hope remains a good but not great metal opera offering. This is the first release of a trilogy of albums that will be recorded by Timo Tolkki's Avalon project, so there is still hope for a future masterpiece.
0374275637|5.0|Mr. Kahneman has done fantastically by opening a new window as to how to look at the world. No wonder why he got Nobel for his earlier works.<br /><br />I loved the book, read it more than once, and recommend it to everyone.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Very interesting, fun, and addicting! Great RPG for anyone.  The only downside, is that it had to end!
145162445X|2.0|I like Mr. Krauss, but this book is a try to summarize his hour talk of the exact subject several years ago, and it is obvious that he has not paid attention to the book content. Like doing research, he must have asked one of his graduate students to write the book, and he has not edited the final product.<br />This is not a long book, but even at its size, there are many repetitions of same subjects, and almost same exact paragraphs.<br />There is a lot more expected from Mr. Krauss than this essentially 15-20 page subject.
B009361C5O|3.0|I purchased this yesterday and like the way it functions.  However, it is not the current version.  I own a Samsung GS3.<br /><br />In the app itself, it says no updates are available.  However, on the main GS3/Android window, it offers a new version.  You download the new version and it will not install over the old version.  If you remove the old version, the download link to the new version disappears.  The download does not show up in the download folder.<br /><br />So, this may be a great app, but Amazon needs to update the download link to the correct version.  Otherwise you are in for an installation update headache.
1452115567|5.0|I am enjoying this book very much and it makes me smile each time I leaf through it. The photos are silly, goofy and downright touching.  What a good and patient dog Maddie is and you know she would do anything remotely reasonable for her  best buddy and companion.  We all should be so fortunate, yes?  I got a second book for my son so he could enjoy it as well.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book was suggested by a friend and I decided to read something different and I really enjoyed it. I even read another one of Robin Sloan's books after I finished this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's cool gameloft does good games but organ trail is weird  it's a shame but I love this game it's asome and cool family game it's a good frend game
B0081BU42O|4.0|I'm an admitted culture fanboy.  So, it should come as no surprise that I like this book.  But, as a culture fanboy, the book must meet my expectations to get my recommendation.  If you're reading my review, you've probably read some Iain in the past.  You liked what you read, but maybe picked up a novel of his that stunk or just rubbed you the wrong way.  Buy this book.  So far, I'm about half way in, it has been a great read.  If dig minds, subliming, intrigue, etc. you'll be stoked.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Too confusing! I usually can follow and understand movies like this but it was all over the place. I couldn't seem to grasp the story or plot
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|guess its ok but not into games myself but I am sure that the kids enjoy it and its very popular in the stores
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If there we're more stars id give it more stars because this game is really fun. I really like this game
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I like period pieces, and this one kept my interest.  The only thing I am disappointed in is character development.<br />The episodes seem a bit rushed and lacking depth, but it still holds my attention and I want to watch the next one!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is so addictive that my husband,  my sons and I all play this on phones and kindle fire.we all try to see how far we can go on each stage.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|While I think this movie was somewhat predictable, I felt that the storyline was original and believable.  The casting was great and acting was on par with what we have grown to expect from a cast of this caliber.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This game is for a beginner.  I was only able to play it a few times before losing interest,  but would be a very good  learning tool for one just learning the game.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great, great acting, great directing, CG, everything is great. The story sticks fairly well to the books, obviously they can't keep everything word for word but they do a great job, except int he case of Danerys Tagerian I feel that they don't follow her as well
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pretty fun so far but a little slow paced.<br />I think it will get more entertaining the longer I play it.
1601251831|4.0|A good tool for switching from D&D, not much new though. Great artwork, and descriptions. Will try to get other volumes.
B0039P1O4O|1.0|I was very disappointed.  Any noise anywhere in the vehicle and you can't hear it.  I will have to go to the Truck Stop and get something worthwhile.  This is going in the trash.  Even when you can hear something, you can't understand it.
B000WC3864|5.0|This movie is an absolute MUST for any zombie lover's collection. No question. The Ultimate Edition also comes with very nice documentaries, and looks nice on my shelf!
B00AEFXGIY|1.0|Babel was very difficult to understand. There were vague connections between the families but the whole film was boring.  Don't bother with this film!!!!!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this episode.  I'm trying to play catch up. I had trouble with my flash player, but received help from your tech people.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|This is a combo side scroller / matching game. adding swords does not make it Role Play Game. There is no rpg component.  graphics are simple. game play is decent.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Enjoyable for the whole family. Loved it as a kid; still love it now. So much nostalgia, it can never get old.
0143039431|5.0|I love this book, the way Steinbeck depicts the tale of an<br />American family try to grab the Dream in time of hardship.<br />The way characters are crafted page after page is just sublime,<br />the language used is simple and delivers the message to all<br />readers, no matter their cultural background.<br />Definitely a must-have in YOUR BOOKSHELF!
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|It was a cute movie & now has a cute soundtrack. It's basically all the songs from the movie but &#34;improved&#34;. It's fun & cheesy; a great soundtrack to sing along to. It always puts me in a better mood.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun.it's challenging and will keep you entertained with each round.you can even play in free daily tournaments to stock up on credits.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love the batman movies. what could go wrong with all of them on blue ray, on sale, and in a compact case?
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Loved this book so much. It drags on a bit in the middle but it makes the ending of the story so much better. I didn't think i would enjoy this more than Ender's Game but i defiantly did.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|The idea of using &quot;match 3+&quot; to attack, unlock doors/treasure chests, gather wood, and more (depending on the blocks you match) to fuel your progress in this simple real-time roguelike is an ingenious concept, and this game executes it nigh flawlessly. What makes it more interesting is that instead of swapping single adjacent blocks like on popular games of the match-3 genre, like Bejeweled: this game makes entire rows or columns drag upon touch and scroll.<br /><br />The many things one can do (acquire all sorts of perks; upgrade your melee weapon, magic staff, armor, and clothes; and use global run-modifying potions) are so extensive that they keep you playing this witty casual game over and over during free time, as you gradually work to reach 10mil. points to finally win. The whole setup is clever and is as complex as it is simple. I'm glad for the FAOTD!
193700788X|4.0|I was surprised to read the negative reviews. I thought this was Charliane Harris all the way: funny, silly, and loyal to the Sookie character.<br /><br />I went into this book knowing that it was the last of the series and expected things to be wrapped up... and they were. I am happy with the ending and the story that was told to get there. I cannot say much more without giving spoilers, but all the characters we love are back - maybe some do not have as much attention paid as they deserved, but I think all the characters behaved as their true selves.<br /><br />I will miss Sookie and the gang!!
B002M87W9K|1.0|Just very disappointed that amazons software would not let me stream the movie to my Tv. It would only stream the sound. I then downloaded the movie from ITunes and with in less than a min. It was working fine. I tunes my cost more for the movie but its worth it because it works with my iPhone perfectly.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|too short. but fun. I guess its worth the $3. could have been longer. can't wait for the next one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love hill climb racing. it gives you a challenge when the map gets into a more rocky stage. also I haven't found any problems with the game. So I'll give it a 5 star review.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I just recently started reading Michael Connolly. Over several months I have read all his books!<br /><br />Love the mystery , the pace , and I love Harry!  Need more books!
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|Nice storyline. No violence or language issues. Good tern movie, however, I as an adult also enjoyed it. Refreshing. I would recommend it and also would watch again.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Friend wanted to watch it, i had my doubts, but it turend out pretty good, I liked it, full of good cast members
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I saw the play on stage on Broadway in NY and this was truly enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|4.0|great game but update 6.1 is getting old<br />and y u no have enderman<br />or abandon mineshafts<br />npc villages please
B0091WET4G|5.0|Classic movie from the days when things were much simpler. This film is superior and much better than the original version put out in the 40/50s. Streisand has a way of making all her leading men look amazing and Kristofferson is no except. He is absolutely adorable in this film and reminds me of Jim Morrison in many ways. Great love story with a tragic end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I like the game a lot it's a bit short I can't wait for the sequel it leaves you wanting more
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how easily I was wrapped into this book. It had characters that haven't been in any of the regular teenybopper books. I like the new characters and I like the plot. I read all of the series and enjoy them thoroughly.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is book 5 and I can't wait for book 6.  The series fits together seamlessly and I have read each book twice.  That is the way to catch all the intricate plots and subplots.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|200 dollars to unlock everything is complete crap. gameloft can suck a fat one. its a game.. not gold. that's the price of a playstation new.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved playing this game, so sad when I reached the end. Please make more games like this one;););). I am always looking for games that challenge you to think, and I love a good mystery.
B006QV30JU|4.0|Interesting story.  Its telling was a bit old-fashioned, but the music was fun. It was like a blast from the past.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|Simple and concise.<br /><br />There's no need to buy a 500+ page book to learn C. C is a small, simple language, and this is the perfect amount of book for it. While this is not a comprehensive reference of the standard libraries, if you read and understand this book you'll know what you need to know to write and maintain real software.
B007SGM084|5.0|INTERESTING PLOT, THE SEX WAS A MASK FOR THE UNDERLINING STORY.  GOOD ENDING.  COVERED A SUBJECT THAT IS NOT SEEN IN THE MAIN STREAM.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I read this book during my lunch breaks and it was such an inspiring read for the middle of the work day. I highly recommend.
0060775858|5.0|I took care of a little boy. He brought this book to my home and my puppy ate it. I looked on line and found it's replacement very easily. It came within days. It was worth hte huge smile on his face when he saw it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's fun to see your village grow, but got to be impatient though.  Takes a lot of time to build up.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My kid was playing this and when he asked for help I got sucked in. I have been playing ever since.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|what a fun movie! even though it was a cartoon, it held the interest of four 14 yr old boys and girls :)
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The boxed set is a beautiful release. The effort made to make the special is obvious from the outside all the way through. I have nothing but respect for this release and display it on my &#34;display&#34; shelf. As to the movie itself. The story, effects, acting and camerawork has set a high standard that others will be attempting to match for years to come. If you don't like this movie, you're Not Sci-fi. Its been done right.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Finally, a movie about &#34;crazies&#34;! - It's about time.<br />The writers and actors, all, did a great job with this work.
B008NEMPTO|3.0|The vampires(CGI) and pretty sad, and The Gettysburg battle seems to last weeks.... The movie is fun and watchable but there is no way I can praise higher than Ok.
B004FOA84A|2.0|It was an okay game, but it was so short!  It took me less than 30 minutes to play all the way to the end.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|While I can usually figure out the ending to most of Grisham's books (been a fan since he started writing)...this one was masterfully written with a manipulating series of events that kept me reading until the end. Excellent, excellent, excellent...<br />Grisham has outdone himself with this one....
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I'm glad I bought this trilogy on Kindle - the books transition smoothly and I just kept reading and reading!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh writes some of the best lyrics and joins them with rock solid rocking licks.  I mean, how many of us techno-deficient baby-boomers have had to ask their children to help them with their electronic devices only to get the smart-aleck and snarky assistance?  I Love my kindle, but learning to use it is an adventure that Joe has his finger on!  Stay analog, Joe, Stay analog!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the trilogy for my Kindle. What a great series! It goes very fast and I really enjoyed it!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Love Joe's ventures into the blues.  He plays the guitar masterfully pulling out gut wrenching licks along the way, simply terrific.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I must say that the first 50-60% of this book may have been one of the most entertaining reads I have had in quite some time.  The characters are rich and diverse.  I found myself smiling and laughing out loud more than a few times.  Not since The Outsiders have I felt such a diverse cast of characters were this fully realized and relatable.  But then the pacing changes and things kind of limp to the finish line.  That isn't to say it is not interesting and entertaining.  But there are a lot of leaps forward in time, covered in only a few words, which gets disorienting at times.  The tone of the story changes and things get much more confusing.  This is good when you are deliberately setting up a great mystery or conflict (which the author does well in), but not so great when it takes you out of the story wondering if you missed some paragraph or conversation somewhere along the way.<br />Overall this was a great and entertaining book.  But not flawless.  Still, it is one I would highly recommend.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Classic, if you like this genre.  It is a must see.  For the most part, movies now a days have lost the art of story telling.  They rely on special effects rather than telling a good story.  Modern directors/writers could learn a lot by watching a movie like this.
B0067EKYVI|4.0|My mom wanted to see this movie.  I said ok and we went to see it.  It is a period movie.  Set in the early 1900s.  But do not let that fool you.  It is not slow or boring in ANY way.  The movie starts out extremely odd.  VERY flashy.  Full of bright lights, fun music and odd people.  The only way I can describe it is this, imagine a Disney movie set in the 30s.  It is that way for a reason though.  They are trying to show you the way Gatsby lives.  After about 40 or so minutes, it gets more settled down and begins to resemble a normal movie.  Though you almost wish it would continue being the way it was.  A man who wishes to be a writer, ends up working in stocks.  He lives next door to a man named Gatsby.  They end up talking and the man gets drawn into the amazing, bright, rich, fabulous world that is the life of Gatsby.  Gatsby holds many mysteries.  There are a lot of rumors about him and how he got all of his money.  Over time the man will become friends with and learn many things about Gatsby.  He finds out that there is really only one and one thing only Gatsby really wants.  It is what he has created his entire image for.  What may come as a surprise though, is that this thing that is wanted by Gatsby, may not want or may not know what she wants.  In the end, if you really think about what you have seen, it is his expectations of this person wanting the same thing as him and the fact that he made a friend that may lead to his demise.<br /><br />I hope that is not confusing.  I can say a few things extra.  I am 28 and have really began to appreciate movies.  All the work and time that goes into them.  That being said, this movie is one of the most brilliantly stunning movies that I have or will ever see.  It is so bright and flashy.  Everything looks so authentic.  As I said, the beginning of the movie is very over the top.  If you do not think you will like it, wait about 40 minutes.  It begins to transform from one art form into another.  You learn the story of the man who is Gatsby.  You learn of the thing he truly wants in life.  You being to see his own true sadness and really want him to succeed.  It really is his live for one and friendship of another that leads to his biggest problem.  I do not want to say what happens.  Watch the movie.  When it is done, think about all the events that made the man go to the place he did.  Realize what made the things become that which they were and you will understand what I am talking about.  If not, please email me and I will tell you what I mean.  Such an amazing movie.  One that I will truly be proud to own.<br /><br />The reason I gave this is four is this.  The movie is about 2 hours and 20 minutes long.  At a point, you feel like everything has happened.  You wonder what else they can do.  You kind of feel it is a bit drug on.  That will go away.  But I still felt it for a bit.  That is why I give it a four out of five.ry of the man who is Gatsby.  You learn of the thing he truly wants in life.

B000000OF6|5.0|Just replacing the set I lost. They'll always be around, that you can be sure of. The same, reliable, authentic collection of solid hit material that's all good and never gets old.<br /><br />Freddy will be on stage forever--believe it.

1596177373|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a Tim Burton fan--they loved it.  I have never seen these before and they are beautifully printed.  Not every card has an illustration.  The Aces, Jacks, Queens, and Kings of each suit have a Tim Burton illustration.

B004GYY714|5.0|Best radio app out there!  I have this for my kindle and my phone.  It's particularly useful when I want to catch up on news programming or talk shows.  It's also nice to listen to stations in other geographical areas (like my hometown.)  It's also great for listening to sports talk shows--the local ones.

B009NG1Q96|4.0|I loved this book though Maxon should tell America he loved her not kriss! I think kriss interfered with the plot. if you want to have Kriss in it then dont make it seem like Maxon  likes her more than America! other than that flaw this book was great I simply can not get over it, so exided for the third book need it now EEK!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a really fun game. I have only had one issue and Amazon always solves them. It is very addictive.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Great story, Jamie Foxx is excellent! Although a little long, especially towards the end, this is a very engrossing film.
0446547646|5.0|I love the story. I hope to see it become a movie. I was sad about the ending but it was great

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I like the continuation very much.  Well written.  The final confrontation, and out come is what everyone who is reading the series has been waiting for.  I hope the next book will not take so long to be available for kindle readers.
0385536828|5.0|I will start this off by saying that I am a fan of Mr. McEwan's work, though I was very disappointed in his last novel, Solar.  Here, however, he has returned to form in a big way.  This is my favorite book of his since Atonement, which I consider one of the great novels of the twenty-first century so far.  This story doesn't have quite the emotional resonance of Briony's but this tale of Serena's brief stay in the British Security Service has many pleasures.<br /><br />McEwan starts off by hitting all the right notes for this girl's experience of the late sixties into the seventies.  The distant father (a bishop, no less) and the mother who pushes her daughter into studying math at university, not because she has real aptitude but in a seemingly sublimated feminism, makes Serena's career path very believable.  Her mediocre college experience, her affairs, her ending up at the Security Service all seems to follow very logically.<br /><br />When she gets involved in a real intelligence operation--code-named \\"Sweet Tooth\\"--it is interesting to see all the small paranoia of the Cold War.  All the minor spying and ridiculous long-range espionage captures the feel in the air at the time.  When it all comes crashing down because people will be people after all, with no malicious intent, there is an inevitability to it that feels right. (Something that is not true in all McEwan novels.  He has a tendency to let the odd coincidence negatively impact even his better novels.)<br /><br />Of course, the last pages of the novel present the reader with a twist that alters the reading of what had been a fairly straightforward plot.  How one reacts to this final reveal will likely be the deciding factor in how the novel in ultimately judged.  I, for one, got a nice frisson from having to reconsider what had come before.  Others may find it more difficult to swallow, but it really fits in quite well and adds another layer to the novel.<br /><br />In the end, McEwan has written something that will be ranked high in his oeuvre.  He has avoided some of his worse tendencies as a writer, creating very real characters here who have a range of good and bad qualities.  The plot is serviceable and the setting is odd yet compellingly work-a-day.  This one is excellent.hing that will be ranked high in his oeuvre.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|Was rather slow.  The characters didn't seem to move forward.  Some parts were stagnant and very slow.  Hope book 3 continues more along the lines of book 1.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|My 10 year old and I enjoyed it. It is a funny story and the characters are interesting. Fun for family.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better.<br />How are they gonna get out of this mess?<br />Last episode is awesome, must see TV!
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|I've loved The Sookie Stackhouse series, but towards the end of the series I kind of got the feeling it went a little tired. This last book of the series was kind of flat, and like most of the rewievers, I found the ending disapointing. It was a basic Charlaine Harris book, but I was kind of left you wondering &#34;What just happened?&#34; when it ended. I would have wanted more from the book, but It was still a good read, just not a excellent one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I give this 2 thumbs up! I couldn't  seem to put this one down. This book kept me intrigued through every chapter. Enjoy!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I bought the dvd AFTER having seen Rodriguez in concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.  Needless to say, I wish I had watched this documentary before being in the presence of this humble, man of great talent and history.  While I was following Rod McKuen way back when, Rodriguez should have been on the playlist!  As a lover of all things Rodriguez, those of us drawn to his lyrics and music have some making up to do for all the years he lived among us and we knew not who he was.  Forever grateful to the South Africans who helped reprise this incredible poet's legacy.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I made a point of not reading the reviews prior to reading the book.  I did however see the star ratings and wasn't sure if I really wanted to spend the money to get this book.  Now I know that I should have saved my money...sigh.  I would have preferred to create my own ending in my head a few books ago.<br /><br />The POV is so scattered and I have NEVER seen Charlaine consistently change POV's.  I've read all of her books.  The beginning of the book drove me nuts with &#34;a tall man, and a medium man&#34;.  I know whoever wrote this book, which I strongly believe it wasn't Charlaine, was trying to create some mystery around who these characters would be.  I just found the way this section was written highly irritating.<br /><br />I also can't get over how many references were made to her garden, and how Niall did something to make everything grow.  It must have been mentioned at least four times that I can recall.  I felt like the author was trying to fill up the novel with nonsense and an overabundance of descriptive words to make the story last until she ultimately destroyed the ending for her dedicated fan base.<br /><br />Now what really angered me is that she put Sookie and Sam together to end the book.  REALLY?  I MEAN REALLY?  I would have preferred that she didn't end up with anyone and left that future open to the readers imagination.  Anything would have been better than this forced relationship.  There was absolutely no build up to Sookie having feelings for Sam.  Snap your fingers and they're in bed.  WHAT?  I had a feeling that she was going to end up with Sam, but disappointed to find that's what happened.  I will not read the next book until it is available at the library.  Not going to waste my money on it.  Ugh.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|The colors and the graphics are just great. The game is a little different than your standard match three games, which is really nice.  There are still aspects of the game that are a little confusing, like the game options and buying (with cash earned not real money) extras. Hopefully things will be made clearer soon. Will probably upgrade to the full version as it does seem worth it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel did it again! I thought the movie was worth a Friday Night viewing.  Me and my husband watched it and thought it was very good.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This is a great show!  Lots of eye candy for the ladies and great, action packed plot for the guys. My husband and i watch an episode almost every night.  Whenever we buy a new season, we start over from season one. It hasn't gotten old yet!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think there should be online multiplayer around the globe. But anyway it is the best game ever next to Modern Combat 4. :)
B004RQDQIQ|3.0|The movie had alot of good actors but ran a little long for my taste.  Definitely not my favorite cohen bros movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun game. My daughter's introduced me to Subway Surfer. You have to be quick and once you learn how the bonuses work, your score will rise quickly.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|A poignant story with many teachable moments. Would recommend as one of  my favorite movies in a while. To me the movie reflect a symbiotic relationship between two people with very different backgrounds, but influence each other to grow.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great I really like it i just wish the pro was free to use for a while so in could senhow it doesp
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love the game! I love watching the world drown in all of my disease ridden glory! Worth e very penny and hours of enjoyment.
B007NG93CK|3.0|It was not as good as the other Reichs books I have read, found it a bit tedious and slow.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help is the best movie of 2011 (along with Bridesmaids), it has everything! I saw this movie at the theater like 4 times, and there are so many scenes in the movie that had people laughing out loud, gasping, upset, and cheering! Viola Davis is amazing, she plays her role so realisticly (how she didn't win the Oscar is beyond me!!!), she makes you feel her maid's character's pain, joy, and every emotion. She doesn't have to utter a word and you know exactly what she's feeling or thinking just from a look on her face. And Octavia Spencer is amazing as Minnie, she is hilarious and has some of the best lines in the movie and delivers them brilliantly! Emma Stone, Allison Janney,  and Bryce Dallas Howard are great in this also!<br /><br />I highly recommend The Help! Movie and book!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Always kept me entertained and had my full attention. Didn't want it to end!!! Can't wait to read the other books of the series:)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is just what I was looking for.<br />My family is scattered all across the state's and this allows me to check everyone's weather at once.<br />The radar is behind by a good ten minutes. so keep in mind that it not showing exactly what is on your radar at the moment you are checking it. But other then that I like it.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|So over-the-top, in-your-face, history-revisionist, black/white-sploitationist, Uber-Peckinpah bloody mess of a 2 1/2 hours, by the end, you just don't really care..
B0095G5AFU|4.0|This is great so far.<br />Some advice for those having issues with the password,<br />it seems to work for me as long as i hit the back button to get back to my home page/carousel.<br />If you just click on the home icon and then go back and click on the notebook it will not ask for a password, it will take you right back to your page. Hope this is helpful.<br />Only thing I would like to see, is more ways to personalize your entries.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Not going to bother reviewing the film, if you like comic book movies, this is a no-brainer.  Very fun.<br /><br />Didn't check out the DVD, but the Blu Ray plays well and navigates well, the packaging is minimal and efficient.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child never cease to amaze and this book is no exception.  All of the action, suspense and intelligent writing is back along with all of the favorite characters.  I truly feel sorry for people that have not read any books in this series.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Okay, let me be first to say that I believe the Amazon review system should only be used for the review of the actual movie - Not packaging, inability to play DVD, streaming, etc.  But, when it's so obvious that this is nothing more than a ploy to squeeze another dollar(s) out of the consumer, well then maybe using Amazon review system as a platform of expressing our dislike isn't so wrong.<br /><br />I currently don't own a 3D player, but I have been buying the 3D/Blu-ray/2D combos with the anticipation that I will purchase the 3D TV and player at some point.  Since I do own a wonderful Korean LG Blu-ray player, that will only play Blu-rays when there is a new moon (or should I say 'Blue Moon') with no firmware updates available, I have to rely on the 2D disc to view most movies.  Also, it is my understanding that creating/manufacturing a DVD, 3D or Blu-ray, is relatively inexpensive for these movie studios.  Disney must not have earned enough dollars on this movie at the theaters, that they have to make it up by gouging the DVD consumer. Let's not forget that it cost $95 just to get into the Magic Kingdom.  God forbid that Disney takes a loss in their billion dollar profits and the corporate executives get smaller six figure corporate bonuses.  I, for one, will not be shelling out $60 plus dollars just so I can own a 3D and a Blu-ray disc.  I'm tired of every corporation and greedy executive getting rich, while the rest of us consumers are paying the price.  I'll wait until this title is in the Wal-Mart $5 bin.  Shame on you Disney!
B004WR125O|3.0|It works as advertised.  My only complaint is the signal is pretty low.  My receiver is not far from the router so a bit puzzled on lack of signal strength.  Still, for its compact size it does work and connects my receiver to the net.  I usually just need it to download firmware, sometimes stream audio too.  Both work so I am overall content with my purchase.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|It's glee!, who doesn't love glee?  Well, I'm sure plenty of people.  But anyway, this series is fantastic for most ages, and while the first season isn't my favorite, they do a great job with song choices and storylines.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandberg brings to the forefront the most pressing issues that women face in navigating their careers.  Recognizing the barriers that marriage and family impose on woman and insisting that men lean in to their families and homes is imperitive for success.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|I had read the book.  And loved it. The movie was true to the book. The actors were very good
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is great for little ones and grownups too. One warning: IAPs are very easy to buy. If I didn't have in-app purchasing disabled, the kids would have racked up over $100 worth of upgrades in a few minutes. That aside, this is an amazing free app.
B000002TLX|5.0|A great find. I really have missed hearing so many of these songs.<br />He recently performed at an event in my city and I was lucky enough to be in the first row!<br />I
0307346617|4.0|An amusing re-telling of many historical stories... with a zombie twist.  It's a bit tedious to read all the way through in one sitting, so as long as you pace yourself, it's a great book!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Read this book and then go spend some quality time in the woods. Answer the call of the wild yourself.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Fast, quick, and easy way to check your local weather (and weather in other locales) when all you have is your kindle available.
B0011Z0YJA|3.0|good driving guitars on a couple of tunes. probably would not buy in hind sight after listening to the whole thing
0345529057|4.0|Definitely worth the read (especially if you like the TV series)!  The stories of the characters are well-written and descriptions are absolutely stunning.  Definitely love the fact that you see a little bit of each character's perspective on the events going on around the world.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Enjoyable book some good twists and turns. Typical reacher justice. Looking forward to some more movies. Still not sure about Tom Cruise.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|A charming musical exploring an evil genius' descent into insanity.  My only complaint is that it is far too short!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Every time I try to open up the app on my Kindle Fire, it refuses to open EVERY TIME, even if its the only app on my Kindle, I think this is an issue with the app itself.
0553103547|4.0|Picked this copy of the books up as a gift for my roommate--he loved the book and wanted to get it signed by the author prior to the TV series coming out.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|It was ok, I usually enjoy Bradley Cooper, but I have to say I was a little disappointed in his performance here, he seemed a little transparent at times, In my opinion.  The young actress did the best job I thought.  I was not upset spending 2 hours watching it, which is more than I can say about a lot of movies that come out.  It is worth a look, so I would recommend checking it out if the description interests you.  A much better pick, I thought, was &#34;Limitless&#34; also starring Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro.

085786078X|4.0|To me, Simon's Cat is the modern-day Garfield.  If you have a cat or simply like cat antics, this book is a great one for you.  It is a hilarious cartoon-styled comic that reminds you of the goofy problems that cats can create in your everyday life.
B004SC7B6M|3.0|I love this music but the MP3 quality is not so good. The music was put on MP3 at too high a level causing it to be over modulated.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I picked up this book after seeing a movie trailer.  I prefer reading a book prior to seeing a movie.  This book was so dry and confusing to follow all the characters at times, that it made me not even go see the movie afterwards!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I don't get the complaints that this book was \\"written by someone else\\" or \\"totally out of character\\".  Anyone who read the last one should have had a pretty good idea what was coming in this one.<br />I'm glad to see Sookie got the ending she deserved, and it made sense in her universe.  I look forward to the follow-up book in October.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Makes your .pdf files searchable and is a nice way to read them without having to scan or flip through every page individually!
1455508977|5.0|This book is in great condition!<br /><br />Loved the book, even better than the movie...but boy is Zac Effron hot in the movie haha.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Quick, easy, and convenient way to check your pinterest boards out.  Has all the functionality that the website itself does.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season, in my opinion, is clearly the best thus far, for make-up, special effects, action and acting.  The episode &#34;Clear&#34; is especially well-acted, I think.  The plot line featuring  &#34;The Governor&#34; is riveting; that character is scary in an almost supernatural sense!<br />I appreciate Season 3 as well because it catches up with some characters which were MIA in previous seasons. Yes, there is the usual drama between characters, but some of it is fine and must be endured in order to follow the plot lines.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The character descriptions and storyline are well-fleshed out during the movie, but, as is typically the case, there is far more detail in the text.  Definitely worth the read if you liked the film.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not to bad. Not a mind blowing one, but a decent action movie without a lot of gratuitous sex or gory violence.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Just as functional as the website and convenient to use when all you have is a Kindle available.  Quick and easy way to check your messages.

B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|Let me start off by saying I have been a huge 30 seconds to mars fan ever since their self titled album. I loved each an every album from them and when I heard they were making a new album I nearly jumped out out of my seat. After This is war I was expecting an even greater master piece, This is war was just a fantastic album and all the songs were touching. Love Lust Faith + Dreams is way to electronic to start off. The songs feel repetitive and have no real amazing feel to them. Some songs sound like pop and others sound mainstream. I hate to say this but some of the lyrics are terrible.<br /><br />1. Birth (10/10) I really enjoy this song, I have to say it literally makes you feel like a bad ass when driving.<br /><br />2. Conquistador (4/10) It has a great guitar throughout the song but the lyrics are poor.<br /><br />3. Up in the air (8/10) Their first single released I didn't like the song at first but its grown on me. It almost sounds like their song \\"Attack\\"<br /><br />4. City of Angels (10/10) I really enjoy this song it has a very great sound to it and I just love the intro.<br /><br />5. The Race (10/10) This song is just bad ass, I love the sound the guitar and the electronic sound in the song. They experimented well with this one.<br /><br />6. End of all days (1/10) This song is boring.<br /><br />7. Pires of Varanasi (3/10) I like the song but it sounds like a song out of Mass Effect.<br /><br />8. Bright light (2/10) Too pop sounding, boring and all around poor.<br /><br />9. Do or Die (5/10) Again too much pop influence but I enjoy the song slightly.<br /><br />10. Convergence (9/10) I like the sound of this song, its peaceful.<br /><br />11. Northern Lights (1/10) One word \\"Terrible\\"<br /><br />12. Depuis Le Debut (2/10) boring<br /><br />If you are expecting this album to sound and be as amazing as their other albums don't buy it. You will be let down like me, I am not saying its a bad album but it isn't great. The higher rated songs however I dorecommend buying I do enjoy them but what the hell 30stm? You lost your spark.
B00A77II0U|5.0|My first time playing a 'find objects' type of game--this one has a great storyline, wonderful graphics and kept my interest until the end.  I like that you can get hints so you don't get stuck on one section too long trying to figure out what to do next.  I would absolutely recommend this game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app for weather ! I use it on a daily basis to see how the day will be! Download it-you will love it!

B009UZBLSG|2.0|Great solution for watching Netflix on a big screen using Nexus 4. Worked great, as others have described -- for 3 months.<br /><br />Readily mirrors phone screen onto a larger display with 1080p definition, audio included. You must charge the phone while projecting -- a full battery lasts about 20 mins otherwise. In fact, even though it's charging, the phone still runs out after about 3 hours. Minor inconvenience really, and not the adapter's fault.<br /><br />However, 3 months in, mine stops working after 10 minutes -- screen goes to static. Frustrating, and unacceptable.<br /><br />It appears the original manufacturer, Analogix, is out of stock? Originally paid $37 total, shipping included.<br />http://www.slimportconnect.com claims a VGA version will be available in July 2013, it may become available again then.<br />I'd definitely buy a new one, peeved, but willing.

B002SSUQFG|2.0|First automatic I've purchased, and probably will never get another if this is any indication of a typical one. I've worn this watch every day from 7a-7p for about a week and if I wear a dressier watch for a single day, this one's invariably dead when I get back home. I bought this because I liked the look of it, but I can't believe how impractical the automatic movement is.

Civil war breaks and the land's thirst is quenched with blood. The wolves howl and the crows caw. The Others stalk the north. Dragons enter the world again.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is the best I've ever seen!!! I hope it last a really long time!!! I have never bought a series before this one!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great mix of vocals and instruments. It beats their first Album, and that on was outstanding too. My new favorite band.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|A classic that we never get tired of watching! Love that this is available on Amazon Prime! We can watch it for free whenever we want!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved this movie. I didn't even expect to love it and I loved it. Five stars are well deserved.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was a very good read and the pictures were an added bonus. I enjoyed it and can't wait for the second book
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The movie was okay but I thought they could have tied the periods together a little better.  However, it was very long and not as good as I expected.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I found this film interesting, although implausible. It did, however, keep my interest from start to finish and I did not fall asleep if only for a few minutes.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|My niece has a million barbies all over the place when she comes to play so I bought this to store them for her. As long as you dont overpay for it, I would say that this is a great addition to any little ones barbie collection. It fits probably at least 20 barbies, clothes, accessories. Sometimes, my niece puts all the barbie house furniture in it. She loves the fact that it double serves as an additional play space for her dolls. Dont expect some fancy pop up anything but its durable, its a great size, handles on the side for easy carrying and convenient to fit in most places that you cant fit those awkward barbie houses thats taller than my niece. Id recommend it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Jack Reacher books and just couldn't see Tom Cruise playing a 6'5&#34; man.  He did an excellent job of the stoic Reacher who takes no prisoners in the movie.<br /><br />He romped and stomped the villians in true Reacher style.<br /><br />I didn't like the use of Jesus' name as used in the movie.<br /><br />This was one of the cleanest movies I've seen as far as sexual content.  There is a lot of violence and action.
B00821OX98|4.0|I didn't really have high expectations because I picked this show at random. I watch a lot of apocalypse type shows (idk why), but this one has some nice twists.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cast is likable, believable, and the script/acting is pretty good<br />Production quality is pretty high. Nothing too over the top, aside from some unrealistic explosions.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slightly predictable plot with many cliche moments
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game! I immediately became addicted to it. I have a competitive personality. I love to give & receive perks, which this game allows you to do with your in-game friends. I highly suggest that you invite your Facebook friends to join you in playing this game since it will benefit all of you to do this. I also recommend that you join the Bingo Blitz Elite since the perks are worth having.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|The most amazing aspect is the quality of these 60' and early 70' recordings. Don't miss it (if you can)!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I enjoyed Homeland (first seaon) so much that I have placed my preorder for Homeland the complete second season. Please continue to produce these excellent series.  I could do without the sexual scenes.  They detract from the drama.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Laura Zedán
B008IBPMZG|4.0|I like it, but it's beginning to look like a soap opera now.  Too many new characters.  I'd like to see more things, diverse things, happening to the ones we already know.<br /><br />Acting is great, just can't keep up with all the names.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely BRILLIANT! \\"Tangled\\" is awesome! I loved everything about this book. If I could give this book 10 stars I would. The writing is brilliant; the characters are lovable; the story is entertaining and hilarious, and the sex is off-the-charts sizzling! So steamy it'll leave you all hot and bothered clamoring for more. Did I mention how witty \\"Tangled\\" is?<br /><br />(Quote)<br />\\"I'm not too disturbed about the semi I'm sporting while watching Beauty and the Beast - part of the homework Erin gave me. I like Belle. She's hot. Well...for a cartoon, anyway. She reminds me of Kate. She's resourceful. Smart. And she doesn't take any s***  from the Beast or that douchebag with the freakishly large arms.<br /><br />I stare at the television as Belle bends over to the feed the bird. Then I lean forward, hoping for a nice cleavage shot...<br /><br />I'm going to hell, aren't I?<br /><br />I can't help it. I'm desperate. Frustrated.<br /><br />Horny.\\"<br />(Unquote)<br /><br />If the cover doesn't capture your attention (and how can it not), the story definitely will as it's all from the male perspective of one Drew Evans. He's a narcissistic, pompous, arrogant, rich, spoiled, funny, sexy, crude, man-whore that will capture your heart. Kim Brooks is the girl that will turn his world upside-down. They're absolutely terrific together, and the sex - sizzling. \\"Tangled\\" is now my favourite book of the year. I cannot say enough about this book except it's one of those books that you'll definitely read many times over. So just drop whatever you're reading and go get it. Don't think it over - just go get it! It'll leave you so content and happy; a smile on your face; your insides all tingly - you'll want to share this utterly delicious find with all your friends.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is loads of fun. I'd totally recommend it. I can't wait for the next one to come out :-)

B007THA4FI|4.0|Good read but very slow in the beginning. The ending was not what I expected three were a lot of jaw dropping moments but all and all good read
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Got this game for my niece to play,but I'm the one who can't put it down! Very easy to play!
B00B1E6DEQ|5.0|Though all six Biffy albums are really good, this one is their best. Every song is great and a few are all-time great. Biblical, Black Chandelier, Picture A Knife Fight and Stingin' Belle come to mind. If you are new to them this is a good place to start. What makes this their best record yet is the lyrics are stronger. It was the one weakness they had and it's been corrected. A cross between Muse and Foo Fighters with the singer from Frightened Rabbit. So what's not to like?
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Pretty good movie from Disney for our pre-schooler, did not involve any real violence or subjective language which was nice.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Who could not enjoy this great group of songs by Micheal Buble. He has such a great voice and his songs are by some of the greatest and he brings them all back to life.
193700788X|4.0|I pre-ordered this book.  One night I was bored and read some of the reviews when I saw how low it was! But after reading the 12 other Sookie books, there was no way I wasn't going to read this one!  I was delighted that I didn't find the problems that I had read about!  Continuity has been a small issue though the book.  In 13 books, Sookie never really aged that much  LOL.  I'm OK with that.  In book 1, Maxine Fortinberry was Hoyt's grandmother and in book 2 she was changed to his mother.  In the over all context of the series, that little \\"oops\\" really didn't change anything.  Because of the comments about the continuity, I went back and read the previous 12 books (actually, I missed one along the way).<br /><br />These books are \\"eye candy\\" for the mind.  You don't have to think too much when you read them, yet you can still appreciate Sookie and her life.  Sookie was first attracted to Vampire Bill.  Why?  Because she found true peace and quiet when she was with them because of her lack of reading their minds all of the time.  (For the record, I was rooting for Vampire Bill!)  After being assigned by Queen Sophie to nuzzle his way into Sookie's life, he fell in love with her.  When Eric outted him later, I really experienced his pain through the writing.  I totally understood Sookie's reaction! Did Bill fully understand why he lost Sookie?  Oh yeah, he did! I believed that Eric loves Sookie to this day.  Unfortunately he didn't understand love any longer.  It confused his to the point where he actually considered \\"bringing her over\\" as a way to make her stay with him, as her maker. Did Eric really ever discover the reason(s) he lost Sookie?  No, not really. Now we have 2 vampires that will never stop loving her but they killed their own chances with her.  Her other \\"suitors\\" never really had a chance with her I don't think.  Alcee and Quinn thought they loved her but they never really got a chance to really get under her skin. Then there was Sam.  He loved hersince book 1 but he never acted on his feelings for her until someone else showed an interest.  He loved her enough to walk away.<br /><br />When circumstances came together, she used her \\"gift\\" from her (fairy) Great Grandfather to save someone she really hadn't expected to!  It opened her eyes to her true love.  Will Sookie live happily ever after?  Who knows.  She has more of a chance than anyone else in the books, but it's still only a chance.<br /><br />OK so I know there are going to be LOTS of people who aren't happy with my 4 star rating for this book.  It's like some of the reviewers took the series too seriously.  It's a series, it's not true life!  Get over it!
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|I like ghost stories, but this book puts a new twist to them!<br /><br />May Elizabeth Trump was a woman who lived alone and loved her independence. She was 75 years old and didn't rely on anyone. She wasn't a social person. Her social skills are a little rusty. When she chokes on a piece of pastry, she passes on. And May faces death the same way, independently. There were so many things she wanted to do before she died. But she must face her life now. And she's not alone. She has a bushy, ginger cat named Mr. Kibbles that died 10 years ago. May is thrilled to have her but she's still not sure what she's supposed to do in this after life. When she meets some newly departed spirits, she starts to get some shocking answers. May learns she has a very special ability that is in high demand.<br /><br />The plot thickens and you are taken into a unique story filled with memorable characters and lots of humor. Not only did I love May, but I also loved Penny and Chloe. Just awesome supporting characters. I really liked learning about the `behind scenes' of being a ghost. Seeing life from their perspective was really neat.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts is when May talks about terms of service. It's so flipping funny. A ghost making deals like this. I couldn't stop smiling. I LOVED it! May is one heck of a character. I'm telling you, you will fall in love with her!<br /><br />This is a clever, unique, refreshing, and interesting read, and I found myself captivated by this fantastic story. I anxiously flipped through the pages of my kindle laughing out loud at all the jokes and watching May adjust to her new life.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and would definitely recommend it. 5 stars without a doubt!
B00B4804KS|5.0|I searched the reviews for the 3D version and found very few of them when I purchased the movie.  I was a little hesitant about my purchase because, really, I had the movie on Blue Ray already and here I was purchasing again!  It was always a great movie in my humble opinion, but by taking it to 3D it really came to live!  I don't fully understand the method(s) used to transform the movie but it turned out awesome!  I have a few other movies that were transformed to 3D and they don't have the look or feel to the process that Jurassic Park did!  For more information on how this was done, there is a review here that explains it better than I ever could!  I don't need to know how they did it for me to enjoy the movie though!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is my new favorite app, it's worth every penny. And it's good that it didn't even cost one. :)

159448385X|5.0|I love this book from cover to cover. It was actually my second read through, I read it first years ago when it first came out and recently I've been rereading all books that impacted me.  Through his stories and excellent writing, I actually experience many emotions while reading Hosseini's books and I will physically cry and gasp! at different parts of his stories. Just excellent!
0812979702|4.0|It helps to read the book and play after each chapter.  Lots to retain, but I believe the book can improve your game.  Came on time and book was in perfect condition.  I recommend the seller.

B0091REZMW|5.0|A lot of fun great way to waste time. Keeps you interested with lots to do<br /><br />Will play for hours to come
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This was on my &#34;see at the theater&#34; list but time ran out. So I was eager to see it online.<br /><br />The first 30-40 minutes felt a bit slow to me. But it was needed to build understanding of characters' conditions and motivations. After that it was rewarding to see the cast and director deliver a powerful story and rewarding climax in an adult-focused film. No car crashes or explosions, just a great story well told about characters I cared about. If that makes it a chick flick, so be it. But real men will appreciate it too.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|It's fun at first un till it freezes. It gets frozen then you can never play it. But it's not a complete waste. Just a waste of time and data because it never loads after you download it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|We enjoyed the chemistry of the lead characters and the family structure; it was comforting to know we are all a bit dysfunctional.<br />It was a fun movie to enjoy with my wife, but her parents wished the &#34;F&#34; bomb was used a little less....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Full of emotion, but also love. A lot of relationships are this way and I can relate on the emotional level. Very realistic and touching. Absolutely put me in tears. Loved it<3

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is a must read, you will not be sorry experience!<br /><br />Self centered, conceited, man whore Drew meets his match in Kate. The premise of this book is simple and common. However, the way it is delivered is superbly brilliant!<br /><br />Witty dialogue, characters you absolutely love and can totally relate with abound in this book. Well paced and often times tongue in cheek or outright hilarious.<br /><br />Perfect mix of romance with steamy sex. The best book I have read I quite a while. A new fan of Miss Chase!
0061950726|5.0|I enjoyed this book alot.  It was recommended to me by a friend who reads alot of history novels, and I was a bit apprehensive; however, I was captivated from the first sentence, and finished it cover to cover in a day.<br />I did not know anything about the period in American history, and its rather sordid and grim &#34;Orphan Trains&#34;.  Very eye-opening, and, in fact, it has made me desire to read further into this time and topic in history.<br />I especially enjoyed the juxtaposition of past and present, and the tie-in of the young and the elder, and what each woman brings to the story in terms of her life experiences.  Truly, an enjoyable story, though very sad for those children and what they endured.  FIVE stars from me!
B00985E3UG|5.0|It's the world's greatest food scientists and the world's best food marketers against the average person. We don't have a chance. I learned how to cook and as an added bonus lost weight. Turns out that the scientists and marketers don't eat this stuff.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|My father asked me if I thought he would like this series. I bought him Season 1 so that he could see for himself.  He's already asked if I could get him the next season.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Was determined to not read the last two books after the first. The romance started in book two and three with witty and very fresh conversations between Christian and Ana. Ran a bit long but tied up all loose ends... again, pun intended.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Love Angry Birds! This Angry Birds Friends has more exciting unique features that I love playing. It's addictive! And this is coming from a 70 year old woman!
B004KA9VGA|5.0|When a witch that has chosen not to use her magic is magically chosen to fulfill her destiny there isn't a creature in this world that will stand in her way. Especially not when a handsome and fearsome vampire is determine to protect her from every danger around. I could not put this book down. The characters, the scenery, the story are all fantastic and utterly out of this world. I loved it! You can't blink because there are a lot of details, characters and historical nuances that can't be missed. The story is enthralling and endearing and one can't help but absolutely fall in love with every witch, knightly vampire and demon in it. You also can't help absolutely loathing the 9 evil head witches, vampires and demons that are chasing after the good guys...
B002M3SOWO|5.0|This was a used book from the NY library and it was exactly what I wanted.  The service was fast and of course the price was perfect.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game is somewhat short, but it is fun. The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible to solve. I'm looking forward to the next chapter. The hints guide you but don't spoon feed you. I loved it!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Fun to play. I always like pac man. Had not played in quite a while. It is a fum way to spend some time.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. I have to admit I put the first book down for a couple of months before I decided to finish it as I thought it was going to be all about kinky sex. I am so glad I decided to finish. Very well written, made me laugh out loud and shed a tear.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 7 year old grandson loved this movie. He is the one who told me about it. Watched it several times.
B009JCL58G|2.0|This is only a review of the sound quality of several tracks, not the artistic value of the content therein.<br /><br />As others have alluded to here, there is a fair amount of background noise.  In addition, I noticed a \\"hiss\\" sound.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2!!!! Its different then Temple Run!!! Its a fun game.That monkey is huge.Temple run is fun.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl tells of her journey to find her true self, through good & bad times.  A very introspective view of her struggle and reaching inner peace through hard physical work, deprivation  & tenacity.  I liked it very much.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|The plain obviousness this is totally real. No that's sarcasm it is a parody of WWZ but a great book.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Chose this to catch up on pop culture and because the series was discounted for the day. Three stars, understanding this is rated strictly as a genre book (teen vampire fiction).
B002RXHW6S|4.0|I thought this was going to be a great idea for my kids, which it was. Then I had my nephew come over to my house and there were three very hyper boys playing in it and it popped. I was able to fix it, but I kept finding more holes every time I fixed it. It was pretty easy to locate the holes so I give that much. However, my kids just cannot jump like they want to in it. It's fun to make it a play house or a fort for the kids, at least that's how my boys have been enjoying it. I always read the reviews on any product I buy online so I hope this helps out. I would recommend buying the jumper, but not to kids who play really rough. BTW--You will need to buy a pump for this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun litte app, my grandchildren just love it. I love the graphics and it is a fun learning game for the kids . They loved the movie and love the game .

B001CB4SRW|4.0|This sheath has room for the extra bits and bit holder that make leatherman tools so useful. The surge is larger and heavier than the Wave I previously carried, but the sheath that came with the Surge didn't have room for the bits and the bit holder, so I was using the wave sheath, but it was tight. So I went on Amazon and found this sheath. Great sheath, highly recommend it!
B009S33I68|5.0|Fantastic book on the battle of the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam.  Hal Moore introduces you to the men who fought this battle and how they lived and died.  If you came to this book via the movie be ready to be disappointed.  This book is so much more then movie could ever be.  You will never feel the same about the movie ever again.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Great and unexpected but enjoyable ending. Just sad that we won't be reading anymore about Sookie and her friends in the future.
B007YZQVZM|5.0|Bought this book for my daughter. She wanted it for casual reading and really enjoyed reading it. Great book purchase.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton delivers all the soap opera fun, in a classy package.  In season two we some real growth among some characters, and it still delivers the high drama and plot twists from season one.  Can't wait to start season three!
B00BESM14U|3.0|This movie was much less than I had expected, given that I loved Emma Watson in Harry Potter. Just much less than I had anticipated.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I finished all three books in 3 1/2 days. My only complaint is that the author uses the same words over and over again.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A blast! Urban's Bones is spot on! Wonderful respect for the original. How does Quinto's looks work perfectly for Spock?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I finished all three books in 3 1/2 days. My only complaint is that the author used the same words over and over again (in all three books). But there is suspense and drama in this book that had me on the edge of my seat. And I loved the ending.

Shouldn't Sookie have ended up with a vampire? I mean thats been the whole point of the series right? Or maybe I just misread 13 books. I thought what attracted Sookie to vampires was the fact that she couldn't read their minds.  That it was a blessing to not have to put up her walls and always force peoples thoughts out of her head. This isn't a case of ERIC Vs. BILL (even though there is one I much prefer), this is a case of being a series of books about vampires. Not shifters, not witches, not weretigers, or gosh knows what else. VAMPIRES!!! I have never been so disappointed with an ending in all my life. CH has ruined this series for me. There is no going back and recapturing that early magic that this series had, because I know (no matter how hard I try to forget) that everything Sookie did was for NOTHING!!!!! She pined over ERIC for books upon books for what, NOTHING! She longed for BILL in the beginning and what his mental silence brought to the table, for NOTHING!!!  Instead she ended up with a shifter who just started showing interest in her in this last book. And a blind bat could tell you that SAM showed not even an ounce of the crazy, enduring, passionate, protective love that both ERIC and BILL offered her. NOT EVEN AN OUNCE! And the cherry on top of the terrible ending was ERIC's character was completely ruined. He was a strong, masculine, loving (towards Sookie), authoritative vampire. But he turned into someone who let his king boss him around like a dirty dog and he was going to have to live 200 years as a slave to a women. The real ERIC would have never let this happen. He would have a found a way to stop this marriage not only for Sookie (because he loved her, or so we thought) but because he would never let ANYBODY boss him around and tell him what he can and cant do. That wasn't ERIC at all.<br /><br />So to end my rant, I would like to close with this fact. Before I even opened up the cover of this book I listed three things I was 100% sure would happen at the end of the series:<br />1. The Felip as king situation would be resolved by him either being killed or made to step down because he was always an issue ever since he was introduced. You cant have Sookie living under a terrible king at the end of the series.<br />2. The marriage with Freyda would not work out. There would be some way of Eric getting out of it. Hopefully by just number one on my list being accomplished. I didn't 100% necessarily think Sookie would end up with ERIC but I thought she would at least have the choice. Plus nobody wants poor ERIC to be living as a slave, that totally disobeys his character.<br />(and the big one)<br />3. Sookie would end up with a VAMPIRE. Whether it be BILL or ERIC.<br /><br />Well folks none of my 100% sure facts, that I would have taken to the bank any day, came about.<br /><br /> All the 13 books we have charged through (especially the last few) were for absolutely NOTHING!!! WE HAVE BEEN ROBBED!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This edition is just as good as the XBOX version in keeping my 12 year-old entertained just on a smaller scale.  So far no complaints.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All of the characters in these series are so interesting.  You believe you are in a real life drama with something changing all the time.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a most enjoyable game. It's neither too easy or difficult.  Graphics are great!<br />I like the way the game changes the three things to collect.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love playing spider solitaire and could do it for hours.  I play it on an iPad which obviously has a bigger screen than my Kindle Fire.  On the Kindle, the display is a little squeezed.  It certainly doesn't stop me from playing it though. I'm definitely enjoying it!
B002DEZXOE|4.0|Having been there, I can attest to the accuracy of this Academy Award winning documentary from the crowd's point of view. There are also great shots of musicians, and the director's cut includes some songs left out of the original. I'm still amazed at some of the performers left out and some of the songs chosen to be included. The interviews with the young producers of the show and the befuddled but kind townspeople are a plus.
B003IVDPC8|5.0|Music where you can hear the lyrics!  Wonderful collection of song tracks.  I wish I could have been at this concert.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book is funny and thought provoking.  Both the angel and the demon are endearing characters.  Satan's son is extraordinarily English.
B000YH6YG8|3.0|i rented this movie, i really don't know how to review it other than say that it was fun to watch this movie again although paying for it was kinda lame.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|If you like action and cars, then I highly recommend this movie. The story is simple but great. Movie will keep you entertain from beginning to end.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I enjoyed the authentic characters in this movie.  It was a different kind of love story.  The acting was wonderful.  Definitely worth watching.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have read. It was funny. Hilarious! Sweet and a little angst...but just plain fun.  . I recommend this to you, all my friends sand I will 're read for sure! Freaking awesome.
0671646788|5.0|This book is pure encouragement and brain food. If you don't get pumped up and moving when reading this then you have serious noggin floggin problems. Ths is an easy read and very positive and powerful! You cannot go wrong by adding this book to your library, and re-reading it often!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|My son told me about this app. He is a PHD student and uses it all the time. This app is why I bought the Kindle Fire. It makes it so I can have my laptop with me wherever I go. I am a busy commercial appraiser and this app is fantastic!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|no damage...Item arrived as expected...in original package. Great price compared to the retail price and I wanted it as a gift so I went ahead and had it delivered to that person.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|An action packed movie.  Solid acting from all, script was clever and was laced with some pretty funny lines.  All I can say is that when the family had finished the movie, we all wish we purchased it instead of renting.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I enjoy this game usually.  However, I don't like having to complete unspecified numbers of rounds before moving up to another level.  Irritating.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|In 2012 I developed Plantar Facciitis in my left heel.  To say that wearing conventional shoes was painful is a gross understatement.  Any pressure on my heel caused sheer mind-numbing agony.  As for the Facciitis there isn't much that can be done for the condition as treatment is limited to the symptoms.  It got so bad I was crippled as walking became hobbling.  On a lark my partner bought me a pair of these shoes (in khaki).  What a revelation!  I experienced instant relief.  I immediately bought another pair (in black).  Not only did the Crocs allow me to walk normally again but after one year of wearing them consistently every day my Facciitis is completely gone.  Yes, Gone!  I could go back to fancier shoes but I won't.  I can stand and walk longer in these canvas miracles than anything else.  My leather loafers and laceups now exist in the back of closet waiting for the special occasions when I must wear something more formal.  Otherwise it is Crocs for life.  Here are a few important details:<br /><br />1) The shoes are sized for bare feet.  If you need to wear socks (especially thick cotton socks) then go up a size.  Even then they will be snug at first until you stretch them out.<br /><br />2) Do not confuse the Santa Cruz with the Kaleb.  They look identical but have important differences.  The first has a couple of holes on the sides for better ventilation and a rubber insert.  The nubs on the insert massage your feet as you move.  Yes, definitely a good thing but they can feel weird (even uncomfortable) if you don't wear socks.  The Santa Cruz also comes in a wider variety of colors.  The Kaleb doesn't have the holes on the sides.  It also has a rubber insert but is smooth and doesn't have the nubs.  The insert is backed in fabric, which is more comfortable for bare feet and absorbs foot moisture better.  So if you wear socks - get the Santa Cruz and go up one size.  If you prefer to walk about without socks then get the Kaleb.<br /><br />3) The shoes are supposed to be washable but at $50-$60 a pop I wouldn't put them in a machine.  Hand wash and line dry.<br /><br />4) The frayed edges are designed to fray even more with wear.  If you don't like the island look simply keep the edges trimmed.<br /><br />5) The canvas shoes aren't water proof.  Just walking on a freshly mowed wet lawn will drench your feet.  On the plus side they do dry quickly but keep this in mind when you are going to be around water or snow.<br /><br />6) These Crocs sit slightly lower than my other shoes.  I had to hem my pants to avoid scuffing the bottom.<br /><br />7) The colors are lighter and more subdued that those pictured on Amazon.e supposed to be washable but at $50-$60 a pop I wouldn't put them in a machine.  Hand wash and line dry.<br /><br />4) The frayed edges are designed to fray even more with wear.

B000FC1AGG|4.0|Easy to read, funny book. Nice for a summer vacation. I will definitely read more form this author.<br />Absolutely recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Is it just me but when I swing something or hit something I have to hold<br />The screen to actually do it hold it really hard please help<br />BUT ITS A FANTASTIC GAME
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me.  I am very thankful as I could not put it down and was so taken away with the story.  When I got near the end of the book I was so happy to see there is a second book.  I am buying that one right now and am looking forward to the release of book 3 someday.  Great job!!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'VE RUN OUT OF ENERGY AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET MORE. I have searched for any ideas but am clueless. I won't give up!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I can't say that I enjoyed the beginning of this Autobiography. I got the far fetched feeling in some spots. However, being a member of the military myself, it did give me a better sense of how life can be after you get out of the service. I do believe that Chris Kyle's legend will live forever as he rests in peace.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Great CD. He is  beautiful and talented with a fabulous voice. I could listen to him all of the time.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I found this book very interesting and learned a lot of information about Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and the pre World War II period. I was unaware of the country's great division on the matter of entering the war. Surprisingly, the acrimony and divisiveness of the congress seemed strikingly similar to our current political morass. I did find that the book had much more supporting facts and anecdotes than was needed to substantiate various positions and attitudes of key figures. It could have been much more concise and still covered the topic.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|good book  why should i add more if i choose not too.  that is unfair and not apprpreciated at all
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My hus and is a truck driver and depends on the weather channel every day when he plans his trips
B0097BY3K6|5.0|Got this for my 12 year old son.  He heard him do &#34;viva la vada&#34;? I think it is called and then began to investigate more of his music.  He loves it all.  I am excited because it exposes him to music with more complication and challenge.  This artist is very gifted.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I was waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire for a long tome I had to play on my friends ipad if I wanted to play it so I am happy it is an awesome game
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It is interesting in that it has different modes of challenging you, but some are difficult to get past.  I usually play a bit<br />before I go to bed to unwind so I find it relaxing.  For kids though, like my grandchildren, it is really easy. But I like the<br />effects.  It was worth the few cents to buy it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|By taking a stereotypical view of today's teenager and applying it to<br />a terrible situation you get a picture of what can happen when<br />people in charge decide what happened and are not interested in the truth.<br />A real heartbreaker
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Gave this to my son who is a theatre teacher. He loved it! Very satisfied with purchase. You won't be disappointed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always King's story is just a little off center but his narrative makes<br />it seem plausible. We all wish we could change history in some fashion<br />but what we don't think about how it will change everything.<br />This is a great love story with a happy ending
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Perfect for my needs! I have kindle fire hd 7\\" and it works best in landscape mode and with a smaller tipped stylus. It seems to use the kfhd as a monitor, and works wonderfully with Windows 8. I decided to try a one month subscription (only $1.99) to see how well it worked with WiFi outside my own- it works beautifully. You don't need a subscription if you work mostly from home. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs access to your home computer and for whatever the reason you can't take your home computer with you.
0679805273|5.0|A nice replacement to a graduation card. I wish I would have planned early enough and had the key professors. And teachers autograph it personally.  I chose to write a sentimental note inside. one professor took each of his students and used their name in each part of the book and read it to her graduating doctorate class. it was a hit.
0062213423|5.0|If you are DirectionerI, YOU HAVE TO READ THAT BOOK. Best book ever, seriously! I really like that book, i've read this book 3 times already. plus all the pics are in hight quality. One Direction are the best idols in the world! KEEP ROCKING!
B001974DG0|5.0|Thought provoking, riveting.  Watchers keeps you engaged and wanting to know what's next.  The power of love and how everyone and every living creature wants and needs love.  Also makes you wonder what our government and scientists can do and get away with.
0765325950|5.0|Easily one of the best series I have ever read. Amazing characters who I will always remember. A truly great series I highly recommend.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is nice. It does what it says it is supposed to do. I installed this battery indicator app on my kindle fire and it's not buggy.
B0041KYLAU|1.0|when I ordered it I didn't know that it wasn't in the English language, it wont even play on my DVD player.Needless to say when i discovered this out 10 minutes after it arrived in the mail, I was disappointed.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This was a real sleeper great story awesome action and Tom cruse was at his best highly recommend it. Got bad reviews but they are wrong awesome movie
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is really good i am very good at this game but last time i saw slender in the sky it was weird i passed this game once but when i had 7 pages he was flying<br />??????????
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I wanted a sturdy, professional bag to carry my gear without having some type of branding on it that basically advertises &#34;expensive stuff in here.&#34; There's plenty of room inside, well padded, tons of compartment space and it's comfortable to wear. Good quality zippers with leather zipper tabs. This is a great bag. I carry a Canon 5D, zoom lens, Zoom audio recorder, cards, xlr cable, hot shoe accessories, and more in it.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie be because it is not the kind of action that you see in movies these days. For starters, movies these days I think confuse the terms action and gore. You don't need a bunch of blood coming out of a human body like if there was a sprinkler inside to say that it is an action movie. You can notice that in the whole movie no one is killed explicitly.<br /><br />Bottom line, good movie if you like action and adventure at an enjoyable point where you don't think it's too much gore. Very entertaining too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Actually thought I hated this book about a third of the way through it...keep on reading you won't be able to put it down!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Great app use it frequently gives me info I need  whenever I need it highly recommend at your finger tips
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington was that addicted pilot who had lied so much, the viewer wondered if he could ever find truth again.  It not<br />only showed what addiction did to him...but all those with whom he came in contact, especially his family and close friends.  The<br />betrayal and destruction spun out of his behavior and crashed into all those around him...very powerful..
B000LJ9ZWE|3.0|Hokey, dated, and poorly done, \\"Westworld\\" can't make up its mind whether it is crude social satire, an awkward action film, or a very lame bit of science fiction. The acting is terrible, especially Richard Benjamin, but Yul Brynner has a lot of fun as the out-of-control gunslinger. Brynner is the movie's saving grace and the only reason to watch.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I already liked this app, using it daily. But the new features are fantastic! Now I LOVE it!! Great job!
B0037VNX44|5.0|This is simply my favorite movie of all time. Funny, violent, sad, and knowing all at once, it is unlike anything I have seen before and it is brilliant. Tom Hardy is a force of nature and Nicolas Refn is a marvel as director. It is worth seeing again and again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story will stay with you forever. I can't look at dogs without wondering what they know and I tell everyone I know to read this book!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Like I said this book would make a great movie. Getting Drew's point of view on the story is a hilarious. It was fast paced and the different character's added so much to the story. As for the steamy parts .... they are so good and like I said  it's from a man's perspective ..how they think...  Or how they don't..... is laugh out loud funny. If you are looking for a  good, sexy, funny story this is the one for you. Thank you Emma Chase for a great read. I look forward to the next book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Acquired for Kindle HD 7&#34;. I know how cluttered history and cache can become and how this can slow down and impact any device, especially mobile. App is free, does what is advertised every time, and does it very quickly. Has various useful functions (uninstall, privacy, etc.)
0061997811|4.0|I love the little doo-hickeys and such that came with this book. Most of the facts listed I already knew, but the pull-outs were very cool. It comes wi th many things to pull out and touch- it really makes you feel like you are in the books/movies. One of the reviews said that the Marauder's Map that comes with it is exactly like the one sold in Orlando, but it's not. The other one has more flaps and greater detail. I am, however, glad I bought this. As a Harry Potter geek, I enjoyed being able to physically touch some of the things, not just imagine it. If you are a Harry Potter fan and have purchased many things Harry Potter and know many facts about the book-to-movie adventure, I would recommend buying this with reservations. The facts are mostly what I already knew, but some of the pull-outs are extremely cool. If you just love the Harry Potter movies, buy it. It is an interesting read. The only reason this is four stars is because I wish you were able to pull some of the things out of the book. There are some things that are glued onto the page and are impossible to get out; you just have to look at them without really being able to hold them in your hand.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Before I bought this book I looked at a lot of people's reviews about it. What I saw was mostly 1 star reviews. All I can say to that is have any of you people been paying attention to the OTHER 12 freakn books before this one?....  Geez. This book is EXACTLY like the others but less bloody. How many times did Sookie say she would never be a vamp?  Like 50 times in each book. So basically a bunch of ladies are pissed that Sookie and Eric did not stay together. Duh. Anyways I am sad it's over I would have liked one more book maybe her and Sam together fighting bad guys or something. It did feel kind of unfinished but I think that's just me sad that its over. Good bye Sookie I will miss you, you have been a great friend.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Loved the characters and story....couldn't put it down. This is one I will read again. Very suspenseful and I liked the ending.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|I've occasionally dabled in making French and Sourdough bread as a part of my goal to learn how to make all my favorite foods at home. I had another book and learned a lot but didn't get to that pinnacle of \\"perfect\\" bread. That was before I bought this book.<br /><br />This is a great read and gave me the education and methods to achieve that goal and enjoy the fruits of my labor.  Ken Forkish tells his personal story of the journey to a career of inspiration that still drives him to learn the age old bread secrets from the masters. Then he imparts them in a number of simple recipes for bread and artisan pizza which are dead-on in their results. His book as an e-reader version is especially useful as you continue to refer to it as you bake.  I will always be grateful for the new \\"talent\\" I possess as a great bread maker.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I was intrigued enough by the preview to go and see this movie despite the starring role of one Tom Crise but you can't have everything.<br /><br />Resisting the urge to read the book I went along with an open mind and was wowed by the stunning visuals but doubt began to set in when I saw the world that had been created after the war.  For example, I could not understand where the technology had come from to suck up all of the oceans!<br /><br />I also noted the similarities between the drones and the Toclafane from Doctor Who several seasons ago when the redoubtable David Tennant was safeguarding the role and later the similarities with the fighters around the Death Star in Star Wars Episode 4.<br /><br />There were other discontinuities too such as when the captured Cruise gets shot but seemingly gets over it without treatment.<br /><br />Shades of V and Independence Day crossed my mind too towards the end.<br /><br />Another discontinuity occurs when jack fights Jack, leaves the second tied up in the middle of a desert without transport, and yet who returns as if he was the first.<br /><br />Not the best conclusion to the tale, I'd even go so far as to say it was LAME.<br /><br />You can't have everything.<br /><br />Worth a viewing?  Yes?<br /><br />Stand the test of time or closer scrutiny?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Bit of fun if you don't pay too much attention.<br /><br />As for Tom Cruise?<br /><br />Not too bad even with him!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book, I've read this book so many times it's addicting!  The whole series is remarkable and would recommend it!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I thought that this was a well done addition to the Die Hard Collection.  I went to it in the theater and will be purchasing the movie on DVD/BluRay.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|found this on my gs3 and decided that  i.absolutely had to have it on all my devices it is my go to kill time game, so.simple yet so freaking addicting
B006M4F67A|5.0|I'm new at Mahjong, but since using 24:7, I've seen other products. 24:7 is easy to play because you can clearly tell when tiles are 'stacked,' making it possible to match them and swoosh them away from the puzzle. Also, the choices of tile motifs are cool! Good game!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I start up uno and it says all rights are BLAH BLAH BLAH and then it goes off----SERiously? Also I have a kindle fire so
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son and daughters both enjoyed this movie. They enjoy the fact it had some characters based on some video games too...!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been in Rome and Sidney .im on Tokyo now.really cool game.my brother and cousin and me have this app.PLEASE get this game it's really cool:)!!
B00BCOQSSQ|1.0|Whatever you do, DO NOT READ THIS DRIVEL.<br />This was bad. Just plain awful. I couldn't even finish it. I got sucked into the great reviews it had here on Amazon and on Goodreads.  The author must be a much more charismatic person than writer to have so many friends to write glowing reviews of his mediocre novel.<br />I want my $3 and the time I spent wasted on this book back.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ENDING????  IT SAYS I've got 1 1/2 hours left Togo but there are no more pages!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game really cool how you get to see your city grow over time.<br />I would recommend it to everyone.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book will keep you on the edge of your chair, but the characters are not very likeable.  Liked the writing, hated the story.  Probably will not read other books by this author.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|creepy its a good mystery hints are needed to figure out where to go next the hints do recharge quickly
B0089ZZXX2|5.0|Got to my house fast then I thought, was in good condition when it got here and worked just as it should.
B001XVP9CY|4.0|If you like sci-fi, and you like 80's movies, then you really can't go wrong with this one.  At times it seems a little slow, but overall the story was good and kept me entertained.  I also really like the dramatic message at the end.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Got to my house fast then I thought, was in good condition when it got here and worked just as it should.
B00991TCOG|3.0|I like what Lindsey Stirling is doing here with the blending of classical and modern sounds, but I feel like she needs to vary it a little.  The tracks all sound pretty much the same and get repetitive really quick.
B008E374PO|5.0|Got to my house fast then I thought, was in good condition when it got here and worked just as it should.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I love this series and I love that you can never count anyone safe or think anything impossible, but I find myself skimming the details more and more (particularly when he lists knights who play no role or ships that sink or songs the musicians sing, etc.). I can't wait to find out what happens, but I almost dread wading through all of those pages to find out.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Got to my house fast then I thought, was in good condition when it got here and worked just as it should.
B006LSZECO|3.0|She is a sociopath and he should have left her sooner.  He still can even with her last hold on him, as a  psychiatrist  and sensible judge would give him custody of the child she is holding over his head. A most unsatisfactory ending and not even realistic, considering the options he has compared to  caving in and  the hell this woman will continue to put him through for all  eternity with her manipulations.  &#34;For one to be taken advantage of, it takes TWO; the one who does it and the one who ALLOWS it!
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Got to my house fast then I thought, was in good condition when it got here and worked just as it should.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|its really fun. GET IT. :) I love this app because its a perfect way to waste time without feeling guilty about it!
B0094K1K42|3.0|An interesting character study of the kind of person most of us know - a person whom it seems that their best moment in life was high school, so they never seem to grow as a person beyond that. It hints that the cause of this arrested development isn't because things were so great, but rather because they were not, but doesn't go very far down that road.  Story moves fairly slow at times and was expecting a little more acerbic wit than actually existed.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|it's fun. recommended for kids who can follow directions. not sure if it reads to you since I almost always play while my daughter's sleeping. I haven't let her play cuz I don't think this was made for toddlers.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|The book opens with one of the greatest truths I have ever read.  I wish I had read the rest of the book earlier for advice on how to raise my daughter.
B007H1HQW0|3.0|It works on wine bottles, but not so well on thicker glass, and it's a bit tricky to put together.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|It's just plain awesome, amazing, and fantastic. I would by this mutiplle times.  Imagine dragons is an amazing band.  Love it.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|movies handles the subject matter very gracefully and Helen hunt doesn't look like she is having trouble with role, we should all look so good at ?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Good to have it for repeated viewing.  Why do you require 20 words to express something that can be said in 7?  Obviously  you don't Tweet.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|This is one of the great western classic movies i had seen originally, and have always liked when i have the chance to watch it again . John Ford has put together  a great movie with top notch stars.
B000059H98|5.0|I love this movie! I have loved it since it originally came out. I Was happy to find it on Amazon for a steal of a deal.
B009NX50DM|5.0|I remember seeing it when it first came out, and it was good action movie as well as having comedy intertwined into it.<br />I had seen the remake which was alright, but i prefer the original.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|Too many fillers and not enough story. Some decent parts though to entice reading on...not sure if I will buy the next.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I actually downloaded then uninstalled this because I was like what's the point but I get it now and I love it
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I probably read this book a couple dozen times while growing up but that was a while ago, so I decided to see if its charm still held.<br /><br />It did.<br /><br />I still love Jo, still want to be a writer just like her, still think Teddy is the most wonderful, black-eyed hero ever written. I still think Beth and Marme are too sweet and perfect and I still get nervous and giddy over Meg and her Vanity Fair. And. I will never, ever forgive Amy for burning Jo's book.<br /><br />Amy. That's my hugest gripe with Little Women. Why did Alcott think it was a good idea to make Amy a complete brat without a single redeeming characteristic in the first half of the book, and then magically turn her into some kind of goddess in the last half? (To avoid spoilers, I'll not mention the worst thing that happened involving Amy!) Talk about teaching small girls to go ahead and be dreadful, you'll get the prize in the end.<br /><br />See? I'm still totally into this book. I knew it was coming, knew the ending, but it didn't help much. This time I did not literally kick and scream and sob when THAT happened, did not throw the book when Jo...ahem...made THAT friend, but in my heart I did.<br /><br />But in my heart, I now know that this blot on an otherwise lovely book, this imperfect ending, is probably why I love it so. There are plenty of books where everything turns out just right. Plenty of them. Like...like...see, they're so commonplace I've forgotten them.<br /><br />Oh, and the moralizing? I skim when it starts to overwhelm me and pretty soon Jo ruins yet another glove or Meg falls victim to yet another petty vice and all is well again 'round the big fireplace.<br /><br />I'm off to read Little Men.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|I think if you have a enough power player (will be more powerful than a laptop )<br />And if you can spend enough long time on burning in your headphone (several weeks)<br />This will be a very good one for you.
B00CJ1C7UO|5.0|I've been more of an Amorphis fan since Tomi Joutsen joined the group. In my opinion, his best vocal performance is in this album. Very passionate and emotional sounding and an overall good mix of mellow, dark, and melodic music!
B0042J6VUS|2.0|This is not good barely fit phone and when one got a case on phone does not fit not even on iPhone with case
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|For the price, this album couldn't get any better. One of Soilwork's best albums in recent years. The talent of these guys is awesome!
159420411X|3.0|This book is a bit of a disappointment because, while it contains a lot of statistics and charts, it fails to use a narrative that breaks information down into common language for average readers. The topics that are covered lean too much toward economics and not enough toward everyday predictions. The best chapter is the one on weather forecasting, because it's the one that has the most application for most people. There's not enough about politics and polls, which is what the author is now known for. For nerds that like to read textbooks this would be fun; for the rest of us that want him to actually explain why so many predictions fail, the book doesn't live up to its subtitle.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I was skeptical about this product, and was fully prepared to be disappointed.but I was thrilled to find that so far anyway it works perfectly without any issues at all. It's amazing to be able to watch on my tv screen exactly what's on my phone. I use it mostly to watch movies and documentaries on the internet that I'm unable to access through my smart TV. it's also great to show family and friends photos or videos that I've taken with my phone.<br /><br />it was simple to hook up, after a techie family member advised me on the HDMI cable to buy. I bought a 25 foot HDMI cable (BlueRigger High Speed HDMI cable with Ethernet, Supports 3D and Audio Return), connected one end to the HDMI port on my TV and the other to the SlimPort, then connected the phone charger (it does have a hard time keeping up on a battery hog like the Nexus 4 but it hasn't been a major issue). I then changed the input selection on my TV to HDMI 2, and presto! my phone screen appeared in large living color on my flat screen!<br /><br />The one thing that remains to be seen is longevity: I've used it several times over the past month without any problems at all. Hopefully it will go the distance.<br /><br />The price of this device fluctuates; I bought it for 29.95.
1592407889|4.0|This shocking story proves that Shirley MacLaine is one of the worst people ever to walk the earth, that she is so insane that she should probably be locked up, and that her ignored daughter is still in denial awaiting her mother's love.<br /><br />The book contains so many stories that are hard to believe that you'll read with mouth agape. Without giving too many secrets away, you have to wonder how a mother can so ignore a daughter (Parker was sent away at age two and only saw her mother once or twice a year for the rest of her childhood), how a father can be so cruel and creepy (lying, inappropriately touching, taking his six-year-old daughter to a gay club where the waiters are naked), and how this abandoned daughter isn't more bitter. To the end she remains unrealistically optimistic and forgiving, rarely learning from the abuse she suffers at the hands of her parents.<br /><br />If you don't think MacLaine is 100% crazy then you need to read this book. She is looney, cuckoo, and wacko, along with being completely selfish, unloving, demeaning, and out of touch with reality. She should be locked up in a home or put on trial for child abuse. Not only did she hide a major family secret from her daughter for decades, but she sent the child off to school in England then \\"forgot\\" to pick her up during her break (15-year-old Parker wandered Europe alone instead without ever confronting her mother) and balked whenever her daughter asked for money (MacLaine loaned Parker $500 for a car only after agreeing to a huge interest rate and years later demanded $850 back from her). While mother spent millions on multiple homes and would buy $2,000 blouses for herself, she wouldn't give her child a penny. She refused to pay for any college education. And she practically forced her daughter to have an abortion. I don't think I've ever read a story of a worse parent.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that it's too long, filled with some meaningless stories about Parker's small acting career in the last third of the book (anti-climactic after the major secret is revealed). And that the author didn't really learn much from her terrible parents. She claims in the last page that she's \\"lucky\\" even though as you read this you have to think that her whole life story is very sad. She's still that little girl looking to win her mother's love.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app a must have<br />every child needs this app and needs to look after a horse all ages thank you amazon
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Hannibal is an amazing show. I was skeptical at the beginning but I decided to take a risk on this show and I'm glad I did! If you're a fan of the Silence of the Lambs (and the Hannibal movie, of course) and the Red Dragon book, this show is for you! It's as good as the book and the movies.<br />The cast is amazing, Mads Mikkelsen plays an amazing Hannibal Lecter, and Hugh Dancy is great too. The plot has a lot of mystery, gore, mindgames and crazy twists that any TV fan would love. If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, I would give it a try for any horror fan, or anyone who loves The Walking Dead, True Blood, The Vampire Diaries and other mystery/supernatural shows, Hannibal will be the right new show for you.<br />I hope this release includes the censored fourth episode, Ceuf (that many fans had to watch it illegaly because of NBC's weird decisions) and it would be the perfect release for any fan of this show.<br />I can't wait to buy it, and NBC has to renew it for a second season, this show has to last a long time!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This movie was very good; the story telling, character depths, and the plot were all great. The acting was also very good, especially Heath Ledger. This movie lives up to the hype.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Great songs.  Personally love the expanded pallet of instruments he has added over the last 3 releases.  A little more laid back in mood.  Kind of in between The Shepard's Dog and Kiss Each Other Clean.
193700788X|1.0|If you haven't read DEAD EVER AFTER, this review contains information that maybe considered a SPOILER.<br /><br />I was so dissapointed.  After reading all the previous books and putting up with all the reinteration of previous facts, I was hoping for some type of really whammy exit.  Instead I got a whimper.  Charlaine obviously is tired of Sookie and has nothing to add to the character.  So, it looks like she is going to be with Sam...big surprise.  It would be more interesting if a great character was introduced to give Sam some competition and then, Sookie had to make a decision.  Yes, she's a strong woman but in all the books she is never alone for any length of time.<br /><br />Arlene winds up being a bigger character in this last book and since she wasn't very well formed in the other ones, did we really care?  Once Sookie is off the hook for Arlene's murder, it's really not that important.  And, the twisted kidnapping plot?  Come on.<br /><br />We've read these books because the vampire-human /man-woman thing was so sensuous and the characters had some pardon the pun, some real-life to them.  This one goes out in a whimper.  Maybe Charlaine Harris' success has led to this weak, auto-pilot end to what was previously a fun series.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The surprise release of &#34;The Next Day&#34; proves that David Bowie can still make some the best music out there.  In a world where pop music is dominated by auto tune, few real instruments and little imagination, this album is a revelation.  Bowie's voice is still strong.  While it took a few listens to appreciate some of the songs, such as, &#34;If You Can See Me&#34;, I soon found myself enjoying the many textures.  Bowie rocks out and still adds the more experimental sounds of his late '70's music.  I would highly recommend it.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|This album has become a new favorite.  It reminds me of Violator (1990) and I can already hear DJ's remixing several songs at the clubs.  It starts off slow but builds momentum so don't stop listening...
B00001OH7U|5.0|I bought this LP when it came out in the 1976.  I love most everything he's ever done but this is the best album, in my opinion.  It includes &#34;Station to Station&#34;, &#34;Golden Years&#34;, &#34;Word on a Wing&#34;, &#34;TVC15&#34;, &#34;Stay&#34;, and &#34;Wild is the Wind&#34;.  The last song is a cover.  I've never heard the original version but love the song.  This album marks a transition from the glam rock of the early '70s to the more experimental music of &#34;Low&#34;, &#34;Heroes&#34;, and &#34;Lodger&#34;.  When Bowie released his newest album this year I decided that I need to have &#34;The Next Day&#34; and replaced &#34;Station to Station&#34;.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|So many loose ends to tie up by the end that, rather than a neat bow, we got a tangled knot, but at least never a dull moment.
B0091VGAXK|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. Even my children loved it and requested we purchase the sound track for it.
1476712042|5.0|Great book; I could not stop reading it. I wanted to put myself in this book and fall in love all over again.
B001R6KCIG|5.0|Well what can I say..... Tresspass is definitely one of my favorite Genesis albums of all time. Even though its pre-Collins, and Hackett. Most the songs have the feel that later Genesis albums have with extended poly rhythms and  provocative lyrics. The Knife being one of my all time favorite Genesis songs. Very disturbing lyrics long before there was such a thing a metal!
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Love this board game (Blokus) so its fun to play on the phone, too. I recommend it. Exercises the brain.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|This movie was ok (altho. I never saw it all) but the service from /Amazon was poor.  Since I couldn't watch all of it at one go and it didn't show up in my library as purchased and I couldn't retrieve it.  It later showed up when I somehow ended up rerenting it by trying to click on the wrong button.  It was difficult to use the contact us button since nothing matched up to my question.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|We read the book with our grandson before finding this movie and enjoyed this film interpretation! Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman were wonderful in the roles of the narcissistic parents! Mara Wilson is an excellent Matilda. We were happily surprised to find that it followed the book closely and added to the previous experience of reading it!<br /><br />Highly recommend to others
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Really loved this movie. It kept me from beginning to end. I would watch this one again and again. Very entertaining
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Didn't even finish watching the movie, Stopped it where i couldn't take anymore only to see there was still another hour.  Way too long, and not Judd Apatow funny, maybe this was the extended cut?
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|We could not follow this movie. Most of my family left the room after 15 minutes. I forced myself to the end and was greatly disappointed. Horrible from start to finish.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Not a fast paced action packed thriller, if thats what your looking for, but is definitely creepy and lingers with you long after you've finished the movie:)
B008602KQI|5.0|I didn't read the book so as a movie by itself, I think it has enough content to make for a good watch.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|It was a good movie, I was expecting more from Seth but it was ok<br />Would not watch it again

B00BT0ZS52|1.0|All star emsemble, in fact several of my favorites, but an awful movie.  Not fun, hardly profound...however, lots of pretensions to the latter.  Overwrought, overacted, arch.  Sorry I wasted the time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps that there is on the kindle fire<br /> I would highly recommend this app to anyone who would want a very fun app.
B000063JZQ|5.0|This version of \\"Macbeth\\" is the best one out there, in my opinion. I saw the film when it was in theatrical release at a midnite \\"buck-a-throw picture show,\\" and it was paired with another superb film called \\"The Others.\\" This version is Roman Polanski at his bloodiest, shortly after the Manson murders and death of wife Sharon Tate, which Polanski apparently was still reeling from. It is an intense re-telling of the Shakespeare tale, bloody, full of gore, but spot-on for intensity and realism. The scenes of the three nude witches, the nude sleepwalking scene and the drama of Jon Finch's superb acting are top notch. Not for the faint-hearted and breathtaking in scope. Filmed on location in Scotland, this brand of the Bard's work is excellent. Not to be missed!
B0091THDOM|4.0|Received quickly great product can be annoying at times to pull you phone out of the case every time you need to look at it
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Pretty satisfying ending to the epic series.  The Wheel of Time series is my favorite fantasy series!  Jordan was a master and Sanderson did a good job of finishing it.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|It's been eight years since Daft Punk released the electronic heavy, powerhouse \\"Human After All\\", and in that time the duo of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo have gotten back to their disco funk roots. \\"Random Access Memories\\" reminds us that they are just as comfortable with percussion and guitars as they are with synthesizers and drum machines. Song after song is interesting and catchy, making \\"Random Access Memories\\" the best album so far this year.<br /><br />Daft Punk didn't work alone on this one. Pharrell Williams brings his soulful voice and hit making ability to the already classic \\"Get Lucky\\" and the inherently cool \\"Loose Yourself to Dance\\". \\"Instant Crush\\" features Julian Casablancas, who manages to get his trademark vocals to shine through the use of a vocoder. The piano provided by Chilly Gonzales is intricate and beautiful in \\"Within\\" which will blend nicely with the \\"Discovery\\" track \\"Face to Face\\" in a live setting. Perhaps the best collaboration comes from Paul Williams on the spacey yet ragtime influenced track \\"Touch\\". Williams, who previously worked with The Muppets on \\"Rainbow Connection\\", has a knack for making audiences empathize with inhuman characters, like puppets or in this case robots. The result is beautiful and tragic and provoke feelings reminiscent to watching David, the child robot, stare at his potential savior The Blue Fairy in the film \\"A.I.\\"<br /><br />References to Stanley Kubrick, who wrote \\"A.I.\\", are also apparent in the interstellar track \\"Motherboard\\" which conjures the unsettling sounds of a nearby monolith. It seems the robots were very influenced by space on \\"Random Access Memories\\" with the tracks \\" Beyond\\" and \\"Contact\\" evoking the wonder of the galaxy. Daft Punk come back down to earth with the fun, funky, disco tracks \\"Give Life Back to Music\\", \\"Fragments of Time\\" and \\"Doin' It Right\\". The inspiration of Chic guitarist Nile Rogers, who is featured on \\"Get Lucky\\", is loud and clear.<br /><br />In \\"Get Lucky\\", Pharrell sings \\"Like the legend of the phoenix/all ends with beginnings\\". It seems that Daft Punk are at a new beginning of their own. They are more popular now than ever, consistently in everyone's wish list to appear at musical festivals, and \\"Get Lucky\\" has become their highest charting hit in the U.S. \\"Random Access Memories\\" is a triumph in every sense of the word and as eager fans dive into the album, we can't help but imagine how amazing these tracks will sound live.  http://veggiefansmusic.blogspot.com/
B00466HN9K|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window has been called a masterpiece but does it deserve that distinction? If so then why? In answer to the first question, in a word, yes. The film is as high cinema as a director can achieve and very brilliantly paints a picture out of each frame.<br /><br /> As many have pointed out the film uses it's basic premise of a handicapped man's only connection to the world being through captivating beautiful girlfriend, Lisa, (played by the gorgeous Grace Kelly) landlady and detective as well as the neighbors around his apartment. This gives the audience the feeling of watching several different mini movies in one although the murder mystery takes the main portion of the film.<br /><br /> The film also greatly uses Hitch's popular less is more style of suspenseful film making barely giving any information to indite the movie's antagonist as a killer despite his profile and the fact he has knives and a saw and a disappearing wife and gradually builds tension as more becomes unveiled. It also allows the characters to be meta participants in this situation letting them voice their opinions on what's happening like an audience would in a horror film.<br /><br /> The film also greatly benefits from it's very jazzy and catchy pre Bernard Hermann soundtrack. The film is further enhanced by Hitch's masterful use of angles and lighting as well as his relationship with actor Jimmy Stewart and their proven symbiosis as an amazing actor/director team. All in all this film is a masterpiece and demonstrates the brilliance of a master of his craft.

I'll be hearing some other female artists and they all sound alike. ellie has her own voice. Look forward to hearing more from her and hope she doesn't let producers make her sound like everyone else.

0553801473|3.0|There were highlights in this book and also useless information about characters I don't care about and don't really have any big part in the story. I'm sure there are readers who loved the side stories but it felt like there were too many side stories. I'm looking for some starting of conclusion to the main plot of the series and some conclusions with some of the characters who haven't been killed off yet. Overall, I enjoyed most of the book - at times it was a fast read, at times I had to struggle through.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It was really really really really really amazing. Juliane hough was beyond good loved every moment of it. Loved it best movie by far

B00C391Y3I|5.0|I saw the Epitaph concert video when it was out for a one day showing in a local movie theater.  Having seen Priest on this tour I was aware of the fantastic songs and sound that the band put together on the tour.  This concert video is a must for any Priest fan.  All the great songs and the band sounds fantastic.  Rob's voice is great and the band delivers like very few bands new or old can.  My only negative on the video is the over use of changing camera views.  The video quality is top notch but too many times the camera keeps switching quickly between close ups of the band members.  Not a deal breaker but something I noticed and wished there was less of.  Outside of that this is a worthy addition to any Priest fans collection of Metal magic.  Long live the Priest.
B003Y5USG4|5.0|We wanted to watch this movie the other night, but were disappointed that we couldn't just rent it for a single night. I stopped at Target on my way home from work, and they were selling new copies for $5.00 - half of what Amazon is selling a 'streaming' copy for.<br /><br />Generally I support our brave new online, digital streaming world... but for half the price, I OWN a copy that I can give or loan to friends, which I couldn't do with a streaming license.<br /><br />I think Amazon should at least drop their price by half on this item.
B0036EH3UC|1.0|First off, religion is the driving force behind BSG as it was in the original series. In fact the creator and executive producer of the original BSG and one of the writers of the remake, Glen Larson, is a Mormon. With only a basic understanding of the history of Mormonism, one can see the parallels between major events that occurred in BSG to those that took place during the early years of the LDS Church. I only mention this so you can appreciate the \\"inspiration\\" behind the series.<br /><br />Now, on to the review:<br /><br />The Props: I don't understand why 20th century technology is incorporated into the highly-advanced technology used by the Capricans. The person in charge of props should've demanded a pink slip for himself and one for the director and called it a day. Who uses 1950s microphones for meetings? Why are doors made to look like those used in submarines? Why does Adama use a common razor to shave? I could go on but the damage has been done. Even the original Star Trek got the doors right and that was back in the 60s.<br /><br />The Acting: For the most part the acting was solid. I don't think you'll find anyone who came across as \\"amateurish\\". Some do a better job than others but everyone held their own.<br /><br />The Backstory & Character Development: The Latin term \\"ad nauseam\\" comes to mind when I think about the excessive use of backstory and character development. In fact, I'll go so far as to say there are more episodes concerning the past than there are of the present and future. This is what slowed down the series to a painful crawl and what made it a bloated mess in the end. Yes, like anyone else, I want to care about the characters but I didn't sign up to be their biographer. I don't need to know the minutiae of their lives. Do you?<br /><br />The Characters:<br /><br />  Admiral Adama: How was this tyrant allowed to get away with half the stuff he pulled off and not answer to anyone for his crimes is beyond me. He was just a thug in a uniform who made more bad decisions than good. His famous lines are \\"I'm done here\\" or \\"I'm through talking\\". Wow! How enlightening. And this coming from a fleet admiral. I had to shake my head whenever Adama exercised his twisted version of morality. What was the rationale for allowing this despot to continue past the first season?<br /><br />  President Rosalin: Now this woman annoyed me to no end. First, I had to get over that stupid face of hers. She looked like a \\"surprised catfish\\" in certain scenes and a dumbfounded hamster in others. I just wanted her to die already. Like Adama, she was a control freak who made bad decisions.<br /><br />  Gaius Baltar: How the frack did this guy end up surviving is beyond me. He pretty much screwed billions of inhabitants and screwed a few more on New Caprica and then gets off for his crimes. To what end? He contributed nothing to the larger community. I'm supposed to feel sorry for this twerp? I have another pink slip and this time it's for the writers.<br /><br />  Starbuck: Her annoying laugh made me want to put her in front a Cylon firing squad. She's an in-your-face character that got on everyone's nerves on the show and eventually mine as well. Throw her out of an airlock.<br /><br />  The Cylons: The machines believe in one god. The production team couldn't come up with something better than this. Must machines have a sense of religion to make a failing show interesting?

Way too much drama for my taste. I guess it was way too much of everything that killed it for me.<br /><br />Good luck.iform who made more bad decisions than good. His famous lines are \\"I'm done here\\" or \\"I'm through talking\\". Wow! How enlightening. And this coming from a fleet admiral. I had to shake my head whenever Adama exercised his twisted version of morality. What was the rationale for allowing this despot to continue past the first season?<br /><br />  President Rosalin: Now this woman annoyed me to no end. First, I had to get over that stupid face of hers. She looked like a \\"surprised catfish\\" in certain scenes and a dumbfounded hamster in others. I just wanted her to die already. Like Adama, she was a control freak who made bad decisions.<br /><br />  Gaius Baltar: How the frack did this guy end up surviving is beyond me. He pretty much screwed billions of inhabitants and screwed a few more on New Caprica and then gets off for his crimes. To what end? He contributed nothing to the larger community. I'm supposed to feel sorry for this twerp? I have another pink slip and this time it's for the writers.<br /><br />  Starbuck: Her annoying laugh made me want to put her in front a Cylon firing squad. She's an in-your-face character that got on everyone's nerves on the show and eventually mine as well. Throw her out of an airlock.<br /><br />  The Cylons: The machines believe in one god. The production team couldn't come up with something better than this. Must machines have a sense of religion to make a failing show interesting?

B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Childish at times when it could have been a good series. A sequel with a more adult theme showing the other six could be interesting.
B0064MGU98|5.0|catching up on the series.. starting from the beginning. Will see if it gets better as it goes on.will see
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Compelling acting by the leading women.  This movie actually should be my favorite but I have to knock the writer or director for the &#34;side stories&#34;.  I fast-forward through them because they really don't add anything to the movie.  I would have preferred to have more character development of Peyton and Elena rather than stories about random and &#34;not so believable&#34; love matches.<br /><br />The lead actresses did a masterful job though.  So wonderful, in fact, that I was left wanting more!  The chemistry was amazing and, best of all, believable.  The movie pulled me in and made me experience the various emotions that women in similar situations would unquestionably experience.  The writer(s) and director(s) even created that feeling of struggle and internal conflict where you don't want to accept something but you know it's part of life and no matter how much you fight it, you cannot control it.<br /><br />It's funny, serious, sad, happy, loving, passionate, sensual, erotic, . . . and on and on.  You'll get it all with this movie.  In the end, the movie left me feeling like I was wrapped in a warm, soft blanket, and everything was going to be just grand!<br /><br />You can and will watch this movie over and over.  Besides, both actresses are undeniably beautiful so it won't hurt to watch it time and time again.  Go ahead, buy the movie and enjoy -- I know you will!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I chose the Ibex laptop backpack after searching for a while which backpack would best hold the kind of stuff I may find myself carrying around. And so far I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />On a recent business trip, I found myself carrying two 15 inch laptops (plus power cords), a collapsing fan cooling mat, a mouse, phone charger, my janitor style lotsa-keys key ring, some pens and pencils, a notebook, two textbooks (one average, one smaller, both paperbacks), and 4 spiralbound training manuals. Add it all up, and my bathroom scale says the backpack and contents weighed * 33.5 lbs *. Yea, it was a little hard to get off the floor and onto my shoulders (I'm a computer nerd, not a body builder), but once up and on it was pretty comfortable. Some people say a clip to hold the two shoulder straps together across the chest would be an improvement, but somehow this worked well for me and I did not find myself wishing for that, but I wouldn't refuse it either. (Somehow I managed to escape getting a !third! laptop myself on my last business trip. Whew!) It has more compartments than my second choice, the Pegasus also from Wenger. Ibex has one more large compartment area, which is what sold me on this over the Pegasus. My two laptops are a Dell Latitude E6530 and a Lenovo Thinkpad T530.<br /><br />With this much weight to be carried around, the Wenger steel cable handles look sturdy. Hopefully they really are sturdy, and not just for show. I'd be afraid that some brands with weaker looking top handles would tear off when I picked this all up.<br /><br />As for carrying two laptops, there is only one cushioned sleeve for one laptop, and so I plan to get a sleeve to put the second laptop into when in the bag as well. At the airport, it was relatively easy to pull both laptops out of the bag and get them into individual Xray bins, and then return them to their backpack compartment. I put both laptops together in the zippered section directly against my back when wearing it, everything else was in other zippered areas, so no fiddling to get the computers out and leave the paper stuff in.<br /><br />I've tried my wife's Dell Inspiron 17R (7720) laptop fits nicely, and she is considering an Ibex for herself, as she expects to find herself carrying around two laptops as well, and the usual shoulder-bag style laptop case isn't going to work for her with that much weight. Her second laptop is a 15 inch HP of some sort.<br /><br />While on the trip, this bag and its contents rolled off of the pile in the back of the group SUV and hit the ground, twice. One laptop suffered enough force to pop a case edge clip loose, and also pop a corner of the keyboard loose. I popped them back into place and all is well. The other laptop has no known effects from the falls.<br /><br />So, I'm quite happy with this backpack. I can carry both my work computer and my own computer, some textbooks for university, notebook, and misc stuff that one tends to find in many laptop bags. I expect to find myself with a lot of stuff in it at times, and so far it seems to be holding up quite well. Hopefully my back does the same. :)everything else was in other zippered areas, so no fiddling to get the computers out and leave the paper stuff in.<br /><br />I've tried my wife's Dell Inspiron 17R (7720) laptop fits nicely, and she is considering an Ibex for herself, as she expects to find herself carrying around two laptops as well, and the usual shoulder-bag style laptop case isn't going to work for her with that much weight.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I did not get to see the series in the original run.  I have found it to be a lot of fun, even the fact that the same guest stars repeat as the killers.  I think Robert Culp was the guest killer at least three times.  The stories are usually good, and Peter Falk is great.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|I've waited a long time for a new DP album and I have to say that I'm really disappointed in RAM.  This is such a huge departure for them and it just doesn't work.  Get Lucky is a great song, the best on the album in fact.  The rest of the album doesn't compare though.  The beats are funky but the electronic voice overs don't work with them.<br /><br />They should have stuck with what got them were they are.  This is pretty lackluster.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I would definitely recommend watching this movie.  Karl Urban is amazing as Dredd and the acting of the supporting cast was top notch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter recommended this and I couldn't put it down.  Great book to take on vacation!  It has a cut throat theme and there is some violence but the author doesn't go deeply into it.  It takes place in north America after most of civilization has been destroyed and pits the little guy against the evil central government.  The main character, Katniss, is calculating, complicated, but totally likeable.  I will definitely have to read the sequel.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I went in expecting it to be a sub par movie for Tom Cruise, but I found it to be very entertaining.  The plot is well thought out, there are some good twists and turns throughout.  Tom Cruise is very convincing in this role.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|For a long time i had a glitch that made the game unplayable. Now it is all cleared up and the game is perfect. The graphics are great and there are many dinosaurs to get. I like that you can now battle. I also love that every once in a while you get to see some classic Jurassic park characters
B00797MB0O|1.0|Don't wast your time.  I didn't watch the whole thing, but the first 15 minutes weren't worth wasting either.  Slow start.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I liked this product because it was full of action, the stars were great!!! I loved watching every show it make feel like I was really their with them. I cried during the sad parts and laughed during the happy scenes. Every episode was exciting to watch.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Good action movie, good plot line, a little twist and a dramatic finish.  I still think the less Tom sets himself to be hit on by every girl he walks by makes for a better movie.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Just did not live up to the great books by  Lee Child.  Jack Reacher in the novels is a much more interesting charachter than set out in the movie.  I would like to see another one with a better Reacher.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very fun game. I enjoy playing it and do so multiple times a day.  When does the next version come out?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was amazing. I always knew Katniss and Peeta would get married and have kids. This heartwarming story is absolutely amazing. I completely recommend it. :')
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I was looking for a reasonably priced iphone car charger. My first stop is always Amazon. Great products with a great price !
B007IXWKUK|5.0|But now wondering what to do with myself since there are no more in the series to read.<br />thank you
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|The music was good, but the movie plot could have been more positive. It may have been based on a real event and was mostly sad.
B008602KQI|3.0|The characters were not developed; the personalities were not really as per the description in the book. This movie did not engage the viewer as the book. It might be a good action movie for those who did not read the book but if you were excited about watching what you read you will be disappointed by it. It doesn't move me to want to see the sequels.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|The compilation of music talent in this CD is very easy on the ear. Gweneth Paltrow was a big surprise to me. She has the country sound and is very talented.
B004MU980W|1.0|Strongly not recommend colored pink floyd vinyls recently offered on the market imported from EU. I bought  A Saucerful of Secrets and The Piper at the Gates of Down. The first one was ugly looking and defective I returned it. The second is nice red color but also has deflect which does not affect play. Both LPs have a huge background noise like 30 year heavily played ones. Keep out of these crap!
B002RVCD6O|3.0|I was re watching the entire series that was being played on cable. Since December they have been replaying every episode except for the Half Blood Prince. I was not able to find the movie in any of the area stores to finish the series. I rented it and it drug on in so many places that I fell asleep. I had to re watch the portion where they explained the horcrofts.
B009CVAUIU|3.0|Maybe I expect too much. I was ecstatic when I found out my library had this Pulitzer prize winning book available immediately. I couldn't start reading it fast enough. This book is divided in two parts. Book I was very intriguing and I read through it pretty rapidly. Book II almost made me send this book back to the library ahead of schedule.<br /><br />The Orphan Master's Son is a story of survival and love all while living under a brutal government regime. Pak Jun Do is simply trying to survive in North Korea. He does a pretty good job at doing so and at times it seems as if he is invincible. There is a certain peacefulness about Pak Jun Do's character even though he lives in the midst of pure wickedness. Suddenly, Pak Jun Do assumes another identity and when this change is made the story becomes quite erratic.<br /><br />Honestly, it seemed like Johnson was writing just to be writing no main objective. This story never came together for me. There was so much torture and gruesome survival methods described until it felt like those were the author's main focus. In the midst of all this, there was the most unlikely love story that blossomed which began with a random tattoo. Another highlight of the story was when Pak Jun Do got a chance to visit Texas of all places. As crazy as a North Korean citizen visiting Texas may sound the author made it fit in pretty well. In Book II the author introduced an interrogator of the state whose story felt \\"thrown\\" into the narrative but it was very interesting and kept me reading.<br /><br />I would describe this book as tedious. Johnson could have thrown away 150pgs easily. Being that this was a fictional account of North Korean society I did not put much thought into all the propaganda and prison camps described. The ending was vague as was about half of the book.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I have always enjoyed the books and the movies do not disappoint. While i wished the movie continued with the story line, almost 3 hrs is long enough for a movie.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Couldn't resist buying the complete series plus all movies. 90 hrs of enjoyment. Dont have to wait for Sundays now on antenna tv.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|A accurately funny movie,a lot of relate-able moments. Paul Rudd is great as always and leslie mann does a great job also.
0374533571|5.0|Great book on hope!  Loved the writing reflected the OCD personality of Pat Peoples.  Loved the fact that even though Pat was the one put away, everybody in the book was just as crazy- just more quiet about it.  Fast read, charming characters , a keeper.
0756407915|5.0|Rothfuss is a powerful story-teller.  The world he's created is haunting & fascinating.  I have a hard time living my own life when I'm in the middle of these books.  That said I'm frustrated by the sequencing.  They don't end at any real sensical point other than he has too many pages to put it all into one book.  Sitting around waiting for the next volume to be published feels just manipulative and soap operaish.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I really enjoyed this series!  The good guys aren't always the good guys!  The characters really draw you in to their world.
034580404X|5.0|Despite the reviews that questions the author literal sense and creativity, I kinda enjoy the book on its entirely. I read the series in 5 days and its not that bad. I must agree that after book one the sex scenes are basically on every page. Like Ana and Christian was going in hard!!! So after book one it does get a tad bit annoying to read. But I love books that are scandalous and explicit so I dont know if thats why I enjoyed it more than others. It does have a way of capturing you if you are into that stuff. I adore Christian. Like seriously, young and rich and single he definitely is every girl's dream guy (sadly guys like him only exists in books). I think James was trying to tap into his readers deep fantasy side sexually and mentally and it all depends on you individual feelings for it. Everyone is going to like the same thing and we arent suppose to. But I enjoyed it. I just which it was a longer series like Mr James really started cutting out alot in the third book LIKE A BUNCH!!! The first and book accounted every day of Ana life then the middle of the third book started giving like week reviews then months and then years.. Like damn dont cut out on me now. A little more consistency and James will be good.. and yeah add more to the series!!!!!
0380973464|5.0|Packed with information. Every paragraph has something interesting. Grabs your imagination from beginning to end. This is Neal Stephenson's best work.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|This is a GREAT album by the FF. If you love alternative and indie rock music, this album is a marvelous idea for you.<br /><br />The order of the songs helps me get through the day and it's just great c:
B006S08RLU|5.0|Unique direction, with a great story. Is a good example of the differences in personalities and that it is okay to be an original thinker.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|The Lucky Ones was abysmal. Safe Haven albeit predictable,boy meets girl or girl meets boy yada yada.the casting was perfect .
B005HJU7HA|5.0|My husband is a Sherlock Holmes fan and has never read all the stories.  Now he's hooked!  Based on his comments I would recommend this set to anyone who has a Sherlock Holmes curiosity.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|The dvd came when expected and the price was right. The condition was excellent. The dvd was great and the music score was excellent. I would recomend this to my friends.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|I think someone had Tom Cruise under contract and an idea for a movie, but the writer they chose seemed to have read the book years ago and only remembered bits and pieces and not the good ones. All the great suspenseful scenes are missing and everything else has been rearranged to blandness. I'm glad I didn't waste more money by seeing this in a theatre. maybe if I hadn't read the book I would have had a better opinion, but I doubt it. This was just too formulaic.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|For all of those who saw and were deeply touched by the 2002 Eytan Fox film, YOSSI & JAGGER, this sequel simply titled YOSSI will resurface all manner of fine memories of the original. Not only is this a fine follow-up film, a glance back at a gay love affair the took place in the Israeli Army that ended in the death of one of the lovers, it offers a story of the healing of grieving as well as the dramatic changes that have taken place in Israel concerning the current acceptance of gay men serving opening in the military. Times are changing, at last.<br /><br />In the ten years since Dr. Yossi Guttman (the sensitive actor Ohad Knoller recreating his original role) lost his lover in the war while fighting he has become an honored but overworked cardiologist, living alone, having gained weight, and his only social life is connecting with same sex dates on the Internet. One of his dates (who responded to an earlier photo of Yossi) is Yariv (Gil Desiano), a young hunk who when Yossi comes to Yariv's house shows disdain for Yossi's misrepresenting himself and settles for a quickie just to get Yossi to leave. Yossi's other 'social life' comes from the nurse Lea (Nuria Lusinzky) who has a crush on him and makes advances that Yossi rebuffs. After a minor error in the OR Yossi's fellow doctors insist he take a vacation to recuperate his exhaustion. Yossi sees a woman in the admitting area, recognizes her as Jagger's mother Varda (Orly Silbersatz), does her echo cardiogram, and subsequently drives her home (Varda does not know Yossi). After Yossi's friend newly divorced friend Moti (Lior Ashkenazi) tries to get Yossi a female sexual encounter, Yossi decides to take the recommended break from the hospital, but before he leave he visits Varda and her husband to share with them his affair with their son: only the father is sensitive to Yossi's past and shares Jagger's room with him.<br /><br />Yossi departs for a vacation to Eilat and on the road he meets four young Israeli soldiers - Nimrod (Meir Golan), Fefer (Shlomi Ben Attar), Benda (Amir Jerassi) and the openly gay Tom (Oz Zehavi) - and gives them a ride to a resort in Eilat. There Tom represents all the buoyancy of young love that recalls the Yossi/Jagger affair and the meeting of these two needy people alters Yossi's life and future.<br /><br />The entire cast is splendid and the screenplay by Italy Segal provides a fast moving, sensitive, and very touching resolution of an emotionally injured man's life, giving him a fresh start in a different world. There is humor, many touching moments, and sense of understatement that pervades the films of Eytan Fox. The film is in Hebrew with subtitles: the subtitles are very difficult to read so be prepared (if you don't understand Hebrew) to pause the film now and then to capture the meaningful dialog.

B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I liked this at first but I think they could improve it you might like it but I don't after a while
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|Very interesting but like most books today much too long.  The author took an essay and made it into a book.
B00899ES5C|5.0|I loved this show. It had everything: suspense, drama, romance, action. Always keeps you guessing. I can't wait until season four premieres.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I saw this movie in my local theater last week. It is dubbed by Disney voices. I really liked the movie. It felt like a 50's movie to me. I will plan to purchase it when it is for sale. It is hand drawn and sometimes when the camera panned shots, it went out of focus and hurt my eyes.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and plan to rate the Dvd when it becomes available.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|don't know about you guys but it works on my fire.  absolutely LOVE IT. YOU NEED IT. YOU REALLY DOOOO.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Unfortunately Tom Cruise did not fit the shoes of Jack Reacher described in the books.  Even if you have not read the books the movie did not in my opinion even live up to the mindless action movie I can enjoy when the brain just want's a rest.
0064430170|5.0|The only reason why I bought this book was so I can have it signed by one of my favorite bands, Go Radio, who happens to have a sing named Goodnight Moon. It's also my favorite song by them.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|So it's up for Oscar I thought and still I  started watching it with very low expectations but the script was tight and funny, the actors brilliant, ended up  recommending to all friends and family to watch it.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|It's worth a watch.  It entertains and old Arnold can still come across as an action guy.  Keep'em coming Arnold!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|The cover with the American flag in the background says it all. The script and dialog is straight out of the 80s with cheesy lines, good bless America patriotism and a plot full of holes. The best way to describe it would be \\"Commando meets Top Gun\\". I would expect this from Tom Cruise but Christopher Mcquarrie, what where you thinking?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Was one of the best of this type of game.  Keeps your<br />interest and the hints keep you from getting stuck.
0545259096|5.0|This ending to this series was good. Couldn't put the book down at all. Great twist at the end was awesome
0385474547|5.0|This book has stuck with me. The writing is so simple, but the experience is so profound. I now have a better understanding of African tribal life (of the period). People looked after one another. There were consequences. If you did something bad, you were banished from the community. There were rituals and practices that seem barbaric to Europeans (for example, the practice of leaving twins in the forest to die). However, for Europeans to proclaim they are more civilized and less violent is ridiculous. The atrocities the European colonialists subjected the Africans to were far worse than anything that African tribes did to one another. Achebe's book does a great job to show how each tribe considers themselves very different from another, which contradicts any supposition that Africans are all alike. This argument is often used in terms of the slave trade. &#34;But they sold their own people into slavery.&#34; Africans didn't sell their own people into slavery; tribes sold people from other tribes into slavery -- people whom they saw as being totally different from themselves. Perhaps the most lasting element of this book is the conclusion. The main character, who knows he will be imprisoned by the British, commits suicide. The British officer who comes to collect him, only to find him hanging from a tree, is fascinated by the tribal practices surrounding the suicide and wants to write about it. It is the perfect way to sum up how white Europeans did (and still do) belittle the lives of Africans by viewing them as more primitive and somehow lacking in importance, instead of seeing African lives as just as valuable as those of Europeans, if only differentiated by traditions and skin color.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Story was interesting, effects were good.  It appealed to my grandaughters as well as my husband.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have played this game all the way through twice already.  After playing the first time, I had to delete my name as a player.<br /><br />The levels get harder as you go, but one is particularly hard if you don't know how to beat it.  HINT / SPOILER - The trickiest one requires you to wait until your hammer changes into a fire ball and put it on the middle tile of the bottom row.  The tiles are frozen so you have to do this 3 times to free the puzzle pieces.  Meanwhile, you have to make matches on the game board as fast as you can so the hammer changes to a fire ball 3 times before you time runs out.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|U ALL ARE CRAZY IF U DONT LIKE THIS APP. U CANT TAKE PICTURES ON THE KINDLE FIRE!!!!!!!!THAT IS WHY THE CAMERA SAYS IT CANT DO IT.THIS APP IS AMAZING SORRY IF U GOT THE KINDLE FIRE HD AND ITS NOT WORKING FINE.BUT MINE IS WORKING PERFECTLY. THOUGH I DONT HAVE IT IN HD.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|This series has a great writing team, they write the relationship with maturity and I love that. If you love fun, wit and sexy actors you will love this show.
B0009QBLA8|2.0|Pretty weird !!!......I really don't know if I'd recommend this movie...it's not scary or awfully gross but it does have its moments...I watched it once and I think that'll do it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love all of the updates and different locations around the world. It is a good variety for the game.
B001MEJY8W|2.0|Good gruesome action but a lame storyline....hmmm...where have we heard that before ..Don't know If I recommend it or not...I watched it once and that should be enough.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|There are some people who are claiming to have reviewed this game but are actually trying to waive people off getting it. This is not the best out there but it is not as bad as they claim. Today it was free so I decided to try it. The graphics and musics are not as mature as some of the more costly games, but you get what you pay for most of the time. I enjoy match-three games and this one definitely challenges me. Instead of tapping to move squares, I have to slide them. At least it doesn't require an in-app purchase to continue playing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great all around game, just wish that that the sensitivity was a little better for when I turned my kindle to sides for the ledges.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I use my kindle daily to read and surf the web, and occasionally while cooking to look at a recipe.  I like that the case rotates so you can view the kindle either way while it's standing up.  The case is very durable, no rips or tears or scratches in it yet, and I throw it in my purse and our kids play with it.  Had the case for about 6 months so far.  My husband also likes the fact that you can plug in the charger while the case is still closed.  Nice handstrap for reading while in bed.  The only problem so far is a small piece of rubber from the elastic handstrap is poking out a bit.  Would definitely recommend!

B009GED3HS|5.0|i loved this show alot, it did leave some things unmentioned or unresolved in the end though.i would recommend it to friends or anyone that likes sitcoms
0441172717|5.0|I just got this book 2 weeks ago and it is excellent. I did not read Dune the novel before I saw the movie on  cable when I was a kid. The first time I watched it;  was strange and confusing; and as I got older I started to love the movie. I just wish I would have read the book before I saw the movie. I said I was going to read the novel before watching the movie, and I am planning on getting the extended version of the film. It is so much better and there is more detail with the extended version. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan; and especially to those who loved the movie DUNE. You will not be disappointed, enjoy :).<br /><br />Kris L. CocKayne
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|My review is short since most others have covered everything. RAM is a step away from previous albums, but it is still excellent. Definitely a must for DP fans!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Hysterical movie.  Definitely not for small kids, but very enjoyable for teens & adults.  It is my favorite of the National Lampoon's movies.
B00C061HZY|5.0|This album is amazing, it has a different feel compared to other albums, but it's a great feel. Worth the wait and every penny I spent on it!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I have been waiting for another true Daft Punk album for years, and this single satisfied my desires for more of their groovy music. I can't wait to get Random Access Memories. :D
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Les Mis is definitely my favorite musical, having seen it in various theaters/productions over the years nearly 10 times.  The movie version worked for me even if Russell Crowe is not a great Javert; other than him (and I liked him) I really had no problems with the voices or the performances.  I got the soundtrack as a cloud download that plays on the Amazon mp3 player.  The sound mix is not great as the voices are a little muffled IMO, but it is acceptable.
B00274EYKY|5.0|This movie was poignant and heartfelt. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, even the moments that were grotesque, because they were included for a reason.<br /><br />I recommend watching this movie for the first time if you haven't and again if you already have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is quite the good sequel to the first game.  It certainly is just as addicting as the first one.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book is too much of a make believe story that is not well written.  It was quite difficult for me to finish reading this book, I am just so grateful that it was free on Kindle and that I did not actually pay for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What an amazing follow up to Hunger Games!  Makes you wonder what the world would be like if we had to live like this!
B009MYARIK|2.0|I got this book my mistake, this type of romance story is too much of a stretch for me.  I am a realist and a practical person and I enjoy reading books that reflect that.  This book will be Ok as a TV movie but as for its literary meaning I did not really care for the make-believe story line.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A dark story however I was interested in seeing if there was light at the end of the story.  I would recommend this book as this is a good reminder that what you think you see when reading isn't always predictable.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Robert Jordan honoured us with an insight into his amazing world of 'The Wheel of Time'. The final book was far from disappointing and gave an excellent ending to an epic story!
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book had a very week plot line. Although the steamy hot vampires died several books ago replaced by too much Fae, she did try to bring in most of the hot surviving characters back for a final farewell. Unfortunately, even Quinn was as lackluster as the vampires.<br /><br />The ending was as expected and a huge disappointment. I would much rather have seen Sookie turned against her will than the dull and predictable ending provided.<br /><br />The better moral of the series, after much death and destruction, should have been...play with vamps and eventually you'll be bitten. It would also have opened up the book for more seductive hot scenes with the Viking Vampire... For a deliciously naughty ending.<br /><br />Instead, it was weak, flowed poorly, and lacked any vampire heat whatsoever. I'm glad it's over and I can move on to better reads.
1596438274|5.0|Rcihard Feynman was a truly rare and remarkable individual.  Beyond being a celebrated, Nobel Prize winning physicist, he was also a great teacher and an unrelenting advocate that physics should be simplified enough that everyone who really tries to understand it, can.  He was as unpretentious, inspiring, and beloved a genius as has ever lived.  I believe it is very helpful to watch one of the many videos about him on the internet just so you can get an idea what his voice sounds like and get used to his gentle and amused demeanor.  Then read this book.<br /><br />Jim Ottaviani and Leland Myrick have done an outstanding job translating Feynman's own stories and scientific theories into this biographical graphic novel.  Most of the best stories come from Feynman's own books [[ASIN:0393316041 Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)]] and [[ASIN:0393320928 \\"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\\": Further Adventures of a Curious Character]] , but there are also excellent sections on Feynman's science from the very accessible [[ASIN:0691125759 QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (Princeton Science Library)]] and [[ASIN:0465025277 Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher]].  All this material is sort of mashed together in a chronological timeline which is amazingly complete.  There is also and outstanding bibliography and recommended reading list at the end of the book.<br /><br />Myrick's art style takes a little getting used to.  His character designs seem simplistic, but it is not long before you realize he is doing an excellent job introducing different characters without the reader ever getting mixed up with who they are.  He seems to be trying to do the same thing animators do in coming up with a specific and unchanging look for a character then adapting that to whatever story is being told, never changing the essential look of the character although that look is highly stylized.  He is also very good with landscapes and architecture which is important to the story as Feynman's adventures take him from Ivy League laboratories to the high deserts of Los Alamos then to the beaches of Southern California and Brazil.  His use of perspective and color are excellent.<br /><br />When attempting to translate Feynman's theories to a graphic novel form both creators work together very well and express Feynman's ideas very clearly and completely.  These were some of my favorite parts of the book.<br /><br />I believe this book would be most enjoyed by people already familiar with Feynman's life and work, but I would not hesitate to recommend it (third on the list behind the autobiographies mentioned above) to anyone who is interested in learning more about this amazing man.with landscapes and architecture which is important to the story as Feynman's adventures take him from Ivy League laboratories to the high deserts of Los Alamos then to the beaches of Southern California and Brazil.

B00BSW6F26|1.0|THIS WAS THE SHORTEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH A DOLLAR. IT WAS A RIP OFF. FINISHED IT IN 30 MINUTES OR SO.IT WAS VERY EASY AND JUST WHEN U THOUGHT IT WAS GETTING SOMEWHERE IT WAS OVER. I DID PURCHACE THE FULL VERSION.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Like everything written by Jeffrey Archer this is also a winner.  Easy read, quick flowing narrative.  I would like more of the same.
B004V5QWU2|2.0|wont download bought it on line<br />for my kindlefire I used my coins and it wont work really sad I guess ill just use I heart radio but it doesn't have a timer
1596912863|5.0|Jane Austen is as worthy of adoration as her characters. Sadly, neither she nor they are always treated with the care they deserve.  Having read an appalling lot of Austen Lite (much of it appalling), it is with a grateful heart that I recommend this work, and with admiration that I laud Hale for her humor and her really, really, realllllllly good writing.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|A HUGE fan of the Bourne series, never read the books so all of the movies were fresh for me with no frame of reference.  I was enveloped by the series from the start and thoroughly enjoyed the ride...until this last installment.  If Matt Damon was not going to be in the movie then the tie-ins from trilogy should have been minimal, instead the writers tried too hard to incorporate extra tie-ins from the original trilogy ruining this story instead of letting it stand on its own.  Jeremy Renner...sigh...all the movies I have seen him in, he is pretty much incapable of carrying a movie by himself as the featured star and this movie was a prime example of that.  He is a good piece in an ensemble cast, i.e. the last Mission Impossible and The Avengers, but starring roles are not his forte'.  I gave this movie 2 stars because the action scenes were as good as expected but the acting and overall story was average to subpar.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Giamatti does a great job of bringing history to life, very compelling story.  Wish my high school  US History teachers had flicks like this to get me interested in history 30 years ago!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Arguably the #1 fantasy series of all time. Both the books and the HBO series are fantastic. Moved LOTR down to second favorite and thats saying something. HBO series is better than a movie would have been.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I remember watching this movie in high school and we compared it to The Odyssey. I enjoyed watching it again. Thanks!
B000FBJF78|4.0|I enjoyed this. Book but I loved booked 1 and 2 better<br />Looking forward to the 4th book.<br />Fun and easy reading.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this game is simple but highly addictive!  very fun although it gets stuck occasionally on my kindle.  I find the little kinks are still worth it tho...  :)
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I purchased this movie after watching Star Trek Into Darkness in theaters twice. While the villain (Benedict Cumberbatch) is better in Into Darkness, this movie was incredibly well made and gave great back stories for this new version of Star Trek.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it made me laugh made me think made me cry. Very sweet and moving story that I'm glad to have found.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|Kind of as stated above, but I got thru it with the wife. Some hot chicks made it easier I guess
B00785P2QC|3.0|great game. wanted something like cityville from facebook and this app comes pretty close. it was free and that makes it all the better.
030758836X|5.0|I was very impressed with the detail (and no slip ups) in the many twists and turns in this 5-star book! I am a slow reader (due to time constraints) but read this book in 2 days . . . unlike other comments, I LIKED the ending because there's room for a sequel. . . I mean how else could it have ended? : ) GREAT JOB Gillian!  Now I'll backtrack and read your other books, this was my first and it was great!
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|As a young immigrant from Belgium, whose mom as a young girl suffered through Hitler's invasion, I connected with this book deeply. His anger, his deep loyalty to his birth country even though he disliked the regime, his lust, his passion for drinking as a necessary fuel for life... I am honestly worried that Bukowski is one of the few authors I can fully relate too. If you haven't read any of his work, this is a great place to start.
1611761182|5.0|Part two takes off right where the first left.  His characters are just amazing and his research is incredible.  I find myself so emotionally attached that it is crazy!  I wonder if anyone can produce and develop characters better than Follett.  Do yourself a favor and buy this book and read it.
0061537934|5.0|Top of the line reading. One of the best ever. The author is an artist with words & stories.  Loved it, Loved it.
0143142364|5.0|Once agin Follett strikes gold!  To put it simply, if you enjoyed Pillars of the Earth you will enjoy this read.  Follett does an amazing job researching  for his works and this novel so well illustrates a former place with a very different society.  If you've seen the series, please don't judge the book by that poor example of entertainment.  Also, be sure to read Pillars if you have not, it was a game changer for me.  You will not need to have read it to enjoy this novel as they are similar but not tied together.  Purchase and enjoy!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use it to wake me up for school every morning I think this is the best app ever evented
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|when i first heard this cd years ago,i wanted it but couldnt remember the name of the cd,i heard it again and wasnt gonna forget it this time.you represent your product well...thank you,i will order from again.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This new album is the slow jam. It's like listening to the Discovery album all over again, and that is a wonderful thing. It's got that 60's/70's dance vibe.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|Good season not the best not the worst, glad we finally know what the mother looks like. But I'm sure it will take a lot of episodes for them to meet.
B005LAII12|2.0|Nope!! Raw, grude, raunchy, and tasteless humor.  If you like Family Guy then this is probably right up your alley but for me it was a disappointing purchase.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|Listening to Mariza's voice is a heart-touching experience; in addition - it's real FADO... No need to understand the words - the music is enough.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is crazy fun. While puzzles can be very difficult to figure out, patience is always better than google :)
B000002JNJ|5.0|Cowboys From Hell, Pantera's 5th offering (counting the 4 albums that preceeded it) is most definitely a classic metal masterpiece as well as an essential for any metal fan out there. What's impressive about this album is the fact that they totally evolved from the glammy commercial form of metal that had the likes of Kiss and Van Halen, to a more thrash/groove metal outfit with the likes of early Metallica and Exhorder. I especially love how Phil still uses the old high pitched power metal vocals, and also uses the more hardcore like vocals that are displayed on albums to come. The album starts with the classic \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", which has Dime shredding and of course the signature line \\"We're taking over this town\\". The next track is the pure groove ladden \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\". \\"Psycho Holiday\\" is definitely one of my favorite cuts on here as it has more of Dime shredding like a maniac *HORNS UP* and also check out more of Phil's high pitched vocals, definitely a classic metal staple IMO. Up next we got \\"Heresy\\" a nice mosh worthy tune with amusing lyrics to boost (you know what I'm talking about). The next track is the beautifully sung \\"Cemetery Gates\\", an excellent ballad that sets the band apart from what they usually do best, but of course this is another classic staple in the band's career. Phil Anselmo can really hold his own with the melodic singers of the 80's and 90's. Then you got yet another classic cut form the band. \\"Domination\\" is another tune that just makes you want to get up and mosh. Great party track, and of course it's Rex's turn to shine as you hear that excellent bass at the end of the track *HORNS UP*, this definitely makes Rex one of my favorite bassists. This next one is a highly underrated classic, \\"Shattered\\" really gets your adrenaline pumping, with Dime's excellent shredding that can just boar a hole in your wall, and of course Phil's high pitched vocals that remind you of the glory days of metal. \\"Medicine Man\\" is another awesome track with more of Phil's high pitched vocals and intresting lyrics as well. \\"Message In Blood\\" is another thrasher that includes some of Dime's finest shreadding in my own biased opinion (actually the whole album does), and is another track to mosh. \\"The Sleep\\" is a more calm track but still keeps the heaviness going, and finally the album goes out with a bang with \\"The Art of Shredding\\" starts out with another brilliant bass line from Rex while Dime just SHREADS on through and the rest of the track is pure thrash from there on, an excellent way to end a classic. All in all if you are a metal fan and love Pantera then Cowboys From Hell will not disappoint. *UP WITH THE HORNS*<br /><br />Killer Tracks:<br />Cowboys From Hell, Psycho Holiday, Heresy, Cemetery Gates, Domination, Shattered, and The Art Of Shredding.e track with more of Phil's high pitched vocals and intresting lyrics as well. \\"Message In Blood\\" is another thrasher that includes some of Dime's finest shreadding in my own biased opinion (actually the whole album does), and is another track to mosh. \\"The Sleep\\" is a more calm track but still keeps the heaviness going, and finally the album goes out with a bang with \\"The Art of Shredding\\" starts out with another brilliant bass line from Rex while Dime just SHREADS on through and the rest of the track is pure thrash from there on, an excellent way to end a classic.

B00C061I3K|5.0|My ears and heart approve of this album. Is it another boring dance set? No. Is it the latest cutting edge sound? No.  Do I enjoy listening to it? Yes.
