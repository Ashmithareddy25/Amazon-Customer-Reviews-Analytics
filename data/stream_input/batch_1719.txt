B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a selection for our book club, and I didn't know much about the plot or the author.  Let me tell you, if you like contemporary, fast-paced courtroom drama that has a number of surprises, then this is the book for you!  Reminds me of Richard North Patterson or Grisham at their very best!  I would say a lot more about the actual storyline, but I don't want to spoil one thing for the readers!!!  Buy this book right away, you won't be disappointed!
0446580848|1.0|Whatever happened to the Nelson DeMille who wrote such excellent books as Word Of Honor, Up Country and The Gold Coast, just to name a few? It's sad to see when an author goes from \\"can't miss\\" to \\"don't bother.\\" For me, this has been the situation over the past several books; and after The Panther, I will not be able to bring myself to read any more books by DeMille.<br /><br />I won't spend time describing the plot of The Panther since you can get this from the Amazon Book Description above. I will say, however, that the plot is tissue paper thin, overly bloated, mostly predictable and, except for the last 60-70 pages, seriously lacking in action and suspense. As a result of my disappointment with the plot I considered giving up on the book at various times. Instead, out of a sense of respect for an author that used to be one of my favorites, I decided to read on -- but I could only get to the end by skimming through many passages.<br /><br />While I obviously didn't care much for the book's plot, my biggest problem with The Panther pertains to what has become a steadily growing dislike of DeMille's main character, John Corey, who has been featured in six books. His portrayal in The Panther is now \\"the straw that broke the camel's back\\" for me. I no longer can tolerate Corey's constant wise cracks and know-it-all attitude, which is much more annoying to me than humorous. This is disturbing because I had always considered character development to be a major strength of DeMille's in his early works. Yet, in The Panther all of the characters are one-dimensional and the villain -- who is rarely \\"seen\\" -- has some serious credibility issues.<br /><br />Based on my above comments, it is obvious that I don't recommend this book. I know my one-star rating is perhaps going to upset some DeMille fans who want to read his latest work, and result in them giving my review a \\"no/not helpful\\" vote. Hopefully, however, other potential readers will view my review as helpful, in that it provides \\"food for thought\\" that differs from the majority opinion expressed to-date.at it provides \\"food for thought\\" that differs from the majority opinion expressed to-date.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This is the fifth book of the series, and JJ Martin introduces so many new characters and loose threads that he demolishes his previous excellent series. When I read that he will (IF?) bring out the sequel (and hopefully last book) in 2014, I immediately gave up on &#34;Dragons&#34;, 15% through, and filed it for when he eventually writes the sequel. I'd recommend Bernard Cornwell's novels, rich in European history from the first inhabitants of Britain, with dramatic scenes of real battles, and. Every novel has a distinct beginning and ending, even though many are part of a series. Also his American Civil war series are rich in the bloody North/South conflict that tore the nation apart, then established an essential part of our nations fabric.<br />JJ Martin lost interest in his series at the fourth book and it shows.

B0071WQ7WU|4.0|I first got into Shinedown with their \\"Sound Of Madness\\" CD from a couple of years ago.  For me this was modern commercial rock done really really well.  \\"Amaryllis\\" is not quite as strong in my opinion, but there is still a lot to like here.  On the downside the songwriting on this one often comes across as trying to write something deliberately for audience participation at live shows.  This in itself if not necessarily a bad thing, but comes across as a bit clichéd and forced.  Overall I don't think the songwriting on this one is quite up to the last album, but there are some good tracks.  The album opens with rockers \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"Bully\\" with the title track following.  These are all strong songs.  The rest of the album is a bit more hit and miss, but overall is pretty good.  One thing that I don't understand with these guys is that they never stretch out much instrumentally.  They appear to be good musicians, but all of the songs clock in at 4 minutes or less and they never really flex their chops.  I would like to see what they could do by adding some jams into the mix.  Overall this is another good album from Shinedown and although their sound is somewhat generic hard rock, there is something about these guys that keep them above many of their peers plodding similar ground.
B000089RV6|5.0|Many (and I mean MANY!) a band would call it quits after their original lead singer/co-founder died unexpectedly. But not this one! After Bon Scott, who only appeared on one recording (1979's \\"Highway To Hell\\") keeled-over from alcohol poisoning, Australian heavy music gods AC-DC made one of the best comebacks in the history of either genre. They recruited a new frontman, Brian Johnson, and recorded a new album (1980's \\"Back In Black\\"), which was one that would turn out to be the band's watershed release, and a quintessential hard rock/traditional heavy metal record.<br /><br />It is hard to decide what \\"Black In Black\\" is more of: Influential, popular, or good -- because it is the definition of all of those things. See, trillions of rock/metal imitators site it as an influence, and it has been covered by everyone from Shakira to Six Feet Under. But it also proved to be hugely popular, as it would go on to become the sixth-highest-selling record in American music history, and moving over fifty-million units worldwide. And therefore, it might go without saying, but \\"B.I.B.\\" is also extremely great. True, AC-DC's riffs are very simplistic and their drumming is so simple that a kid could play most any of these drum beats after just one lesson. (AC-DC are famous for taking a stripped down, bare-bones approach to musicianship, with only one or two guitar notes per song, and drum patterns that strictly adhere to basic 4/4 timing.) But the simplicity of the arrangements are, at least in part, why the music is so great. Strongly hooky, always stripped of superfluous fat and frills, positively air-guitar-able, and easy to hum along to, these ten songs are instinctively memorable and insanely infectious. And the fact that it would spawn a bunch of world-famous hit singles (track numbers one, two, four, six, seven, eight and ten are all regular staples in rock radio) is further proof of this fact.<br /><br />It all begins with the sound of a bell ringing, before \\"Hells Bells\\" filters-in in a terrifically catchy, toe-tappable guitar hook underpinned by a grumbling bass bottom. And it is all topped off by a chugging rhythm, memorable vocal hooks -- including some very catchy and memorable choruses -- and a soaring, wailing guitar solo. \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" then follows this up with a prominent, grumbling bass line, and terrifically catchy, bouncy, swinging groove. And another really catchy chorus, fist-pumping vocals, crashing drum cymbals, and a shredding guitar solo are also included. When all is said and done, the end result is a great party anthem. By comparison to these two songs, a track like \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" is not nearly as memorable. But in no way does that mean it falls flat, either. Indeed, a sturdy, muscular bass line (which flows throughout) and a terrifically ripping, ascending and descending guitar solo make this one another keeper.<br /><br />The next two cuts, \\"Givin The Dog A Bone\\" and the laid back rocker/near ballad \\"Let Me Put My Love In You,\\" both boast more lengthy, exceptional solo sections -- the former opts for the noisy, shredding type, and the latter the melodic, soaring, and even kind of bluesy, style. Next up is the album's title track - a song so great that it is almost deserving of a whole new review. It is a terrifically catchy and infectious piece with a simple, crashing drum beat, an adherent groove, and unforgettable vocals and lyrics. And the fact that it also features some of the absolute finest and most wailing guitar solos in AC-DC's history (they are truly amazing!) make \\"Back In Black\\" a probable highpoint.<br /><br />Then comes two more ridiculously catchy, nearly danceable party tunes: \\"Shook Me All Night Long\\" and \\"Have A Drink On Me,\\" both of which are feature excellent, air-guitar-worthy soloing, irresistible swinging rhythms, killer vocals, and choruses that are tailor-made for being a radio hit. \\"Shake A Leg\\" is a more up-tempo, heavy, and driving piece that adheres to a reallycontagious groove, and tosses in still more excellent, twiddly, winding guitar solos. It sets the stage perfectly for the set closer, \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution,\\" another party/mosh-pit-ready anthem with a very simple yet irresistible, sing-songy refrain. (it is essentially just the fist-pumpable title phrase repeated over and over again.)<br /><br />Why don't you already own \\"Back In Black\\"?! It is nothing if not a truly classic album, a huge landmark release, and a cornerstone in every hard rock/traditional heavy metal collection.contagious groove, and tosses in still more excellent, twiddly, winding guitar solos.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|I found the Verso Artist Series Case for my Kindle Fire makes me want to stay on the Fire a little longer. The writing on the cover lists name of Cities in a beautiful script. It is just a pleasure to feel the texture and luxury this cover offers in my hand. My Kindle Fire fit perfectly. It was a snug fit and a little difficult to get those elastic corners pulled around the Fire but once the Fire is properly secured you can rest assured that it isn't going to slip out. Those of you who like to close your covers with a tab or closure of some sort will be disappointed as this cover does not have one. I haven't found that to be a problem myself. You will be pleased with the quality and elegance this cover offers.

B005H1SDQU|5.0|Steve Hackett is amazing to me, year after year he continues to put out excellent music yet is sadly overlooked by most of the mainstream.  Those still pining for the days of old, when Hackett was a member of Genesis, really need to check out the music he is doing today.  In the past decade Steve has released some of the best music of his entire career, and \\"Beyond The Shrouded Horizon\\" is yet another stellar release that shows the that the 60 plus year old guitarist is still at the top of his game.  This two disc set explores all of the many nuances of Steve's repertoire.  Progressive rock, blues, straight ahead rock n roll, ballads, orchestral movements, it is all here.  Steve continues to push himself and not rest on his laurels.  He has once again put together a top notch band along with several high profile guests.  The music is stellar with vocals and lyrics to match.  This is another 5 star gem from a man who should have a much higher profile.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Really really cute game. Who doesn't love dragons?  Like the other ones, it's pretty easy to advance levels at the beginning. Gets harder and takes longer as you advance.
0345505387|3.0|Surprisingly, I didn't care for this. I'm a big fan of Gabaldon's Outlander series (I think it's one of the greatest love stories in fiction), but The Exile just didn't do much for me.<br /><br />I knew that there wouldn't be many surprises in the story. It's basically the first book, Outlander, from Jamie's point of view. There are a few new things, but nothing earth-shattering. So that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Really, I think it was the artwork. The style didn't resonate with me. I found Claire to be a bit too much on the buxom side. Her boobs are hanging out all over the place. And all of the men looked too much alike -- shaggy hair, sharp noses, kilts. I had a difficult time telling them apart.<br /><br />But, it's a short read, so it wasn't too painful. Though I love the Outlander world, I don't think I would read a second graphic novel set in it. Unless it was a different artist.

1442419814|4.0|This book has been sitting on my shelf for a long time, and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it. Tally's world is physically the same as ours (as in, Earth), but time and an apocalypse (an oil-destroying bacteria) have changed things. Much of the world is uninhabited, and most of those that remain live in segregated cities such as Tally's. On one side of the river are the young, the Uglies. On the other side, the Pretties.<br /><br />It was decided, post-apocalypse, that all of the world's problems were caused by inequality. Not only financial or social, but physical. So, upon their sixteenth birthday, everyone is given plastic surgery to become Pretty. They then spend the rest of their young-adulthood going to parties, basically.<br /><br />Tally is about to become Pretty, and never thought about doing otherwise before she runs into Shay. Shay doesn't want to become Pretty. She's learned of a settlement of people living outside of the city (the Smokes), and she'd rather be a part of that society than the one she's expected to join. She asks Tally to come with her, but Tally is unsure, until the decision is made for her.<br /><br />I thought the book had some interesting things to say about conformity and oppressive monitoring by the government. For a heroine, Tally does tend to be rather passive. Most of what happens to her is a result of what other people have either done or made her do, and I have to admit I didn't love her. But, the story itself is compelling enough that I don't have to love her to want to see what happens to her.<br /><br />Overall, it was just an enjoyable story. Westerfeld has created an interesting world, and I'll definitely be reading more to see what he does with it.

B008J1QFLU|5.0|Weighty and well designed, there are already a lot of reviews on other sites about the terrific job Decca has done remastering this classic for Sir Georg Solti's centenary. I ordered it a couple of months in advance and had concerns that based on the size and weight, Amazon was going to ship it with poor protection.  Sure enough, it arrived today and was damaged with a big gash on the bottom of the box set.  It was tossed into a big shipping box with some bubble wrap and some shrink wrap around it that only protected a couple of sides.  Beyond that, it was left to bang around in the box.  The set is really a work of art. So it's a shame it was damaged by careless handling.  Debating on whether to return it.  Amazon is very good about those things.  But the question is:  Why not have some shipping standards to prevent the issue in the first place?  This seems to happen with a lot of larger items.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson flicks are quirky fun and this one is no different. Based on the previews, we couldn't quite tell what it was about - but it did not disappoint. If you thought The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was worth your time, then you'll likely feel that way about this movie as well.
B008MM9630|3.0|This is a very cute game and I really like that it does not require an internet connection.<br /><br />What I absolutely do not like is that by level 19, I am almost stuck on quests.  I have four quests:  (1) requires an Ent tree with no hint on how to get one (they are not available in the tree menu  (2)wants fortune cookies which apparently are easier to get if you have a fortune tree which costs 120 gems - without it, I have two fortune cookies thus far by level 19 (3) the only one I am actively working on now - requires growing a variety of plants (4) requires a peacock which takes 200 gems.<br /><br />The issue is that the main way to get gems is by leveling up or completing quests - unless you do what they want you to do and buy them with real money.  I am very willing to patiently play a game but this game is continuing to close doors by offering fewer and fewer quests (one out of four now) that are not pushing you to buy gems or else to wait a very long time to earn enough gems by leveling up (at one gem per level) to complete one quest.<br /><br />Since you also need gems to do things like expand your land beyond the first expansion, you quickly eat into the supply you earn making it very difficult to complete the quests that require items that cost a lot of gems.  Note that all animals but one cost gems.<br /><br />I think the game needs better explanations or an online FAQ somewhere to answer questions not answered in the quest instructions or by exploring the menus(such as where does one get an Ent tree) and far more quests that don't require items that cost a lot of gems in order to complete them so that you can get a few gems.  I will continue playing long enough to complete the one quest I am on that does not require gems, but if that is also replaced by one that requires gems to complete, that will be it for this game for me.<br /><br />It is not that I am not willing to spend money to support games that I enjoy.  I do so regularly, but I want it tobe my choice, not something the developers try to force me into by making most of the things needed to progress in the game almost unobtainable in any way other than to pay for it with actual money.  Even though I enjoy this game, I will not spend money on it because of the way I feel I am being corralled into a situation where I have very few choices if I want to progress in the game.<br /><br />11_09_12 edit  The Ent did show up, was a tree with a different name.  Figured that out when I gained another level and the pictures matched even though the names did not.  It does not change my overall opinion though that this game pushes too hard (by making too many required things only available for a lot of gems) for you to spend real life money.
B008RTE09S|4.0|Most of the people getting the DVD have seen it before, and wanted to get this and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" on Blu-Ray. There's nothing much to say about the actual film itself- they tried to do an Electric Kool Aid Acid Test meets the Blackpool Lights. It does make one wish Terry Gilliam or Richard Lester to make it more cohesive, but as a long form video, the meat and bones of the film are the songs put to film.<br /><br />I can't imagine what the audience who saw this on Boxing Day made from this movie. They weren't the four lovable moptops people loved in \\"Help\\" and \\"A Hard Days Night\\", that's for sure. The vibe was \\"we're the Beatles, we can do anything we want, and people will love it\\". Not when this came out! The bloom was off the rose, and it would be less than a year when John and Yoko would put \\"Two Virgins\\" out.<br /><br />I think for the fan club secretaries who are in the \\"making of\\" and played extras, it was a great time for them because when else would they have had access to the band?<br /><br />I do find it interesting that none of them had their wives and girlfriends in it, even though they filmed it close to home. Maybe not Cynthia or Maureen, but I figured at least Patti Boyd & Jane Asher would've made some sort of appearance in it because people were familiar with them.<br /><br />I think the scene with John shoveling food has all sorts of things going in it, kind of disturbing, but knowing his dad did menial work (Paul mentions John looking like his father in the commentary), John's weight issues, and a little bit of the tone of \\"In His Own Write\\", is not so surreal.<br /><br />The restoration looks as good as we're going to get.I'm got a DVD copy from the library just to compare picture quality, but I didn't see much of a difference, but listening to it was worth getting it. I am enjoying hearing the Beatles on Blu Ray though!!<br /><br />The commentary by Paul - some of it's familiar stuff, but still interesting to hear him talk about.<br /><br />The bonus about the actors was interesting and the outtakes were really cool to see.<br /><br />As far as Ringo goes, it's not like he ever made great movies, but he did get to work with great actors and the most natural in front of a camera.<br /><br />Paul as a filmmaker - you would've thought this would've let him stick to just making music and videos, but no, he did \\"Give My Regard To Broad Street\\". His animation DVD is great and his music video compilations are awesome, but as a filmmaker? I think when George became a producer for Monty Python and other films, he should have done something with Ringo and Paul.<br /><br />Why the promos weren't included, makes no sense unless there's plans for a video collection, but to not include \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and the two other versions of \\"Hello Goodbye\\", but was pretty cool seeing the promo on the DVD. One of the best things to see is the footage of Traffic.<br /><br />The question will always be whether or not they should've made a film around \\"Sgt Pepper\\".<br /><br />Summary: the DVD & Blu Ray visual quality doesn't make much of a difference but look good, the bonuses are good, and commentary by McCartney make it worth getting.<br /><br />Unrelated - DO watch the great \\"Magic Trips\\" documentary about the real Merry Pranksters.<br /><br />MMT is more the \\"merry because they're high, but not all that Fab...but at least the music's great\\".

While the pace and character development went well, I have a huge issue with movies that wrap up the ending in five minutes by killing a seemingly formidable antagonist quickly and easily (think: This Means War). Spoiler alert: that's the trap Prometheus fell in to and with it any chance of being remembered as anything but a movie that had SO much potential it never delivered.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|While I can appreciate the new twist on the Angry Birds game and enjoyed the new powers I can't help but feel slightly cheated by Rovio. As they continue to release games, they want to continue to milk the consumer. I'm fine paying $2.99 for a full game. But when it becomes $2.99 for a full game and $1.99 for an extra location and then you can buy endless aids in the game. Yes, I understand you don't need to buy these items, but if anyone else did this with their apps, people would be flipping out and Rovio isn't a company hurting for money.<br /><br />Does the game work on the Kindle Fire, yes it does. It lags a little at first, but then it keeps up the face. Controls are responsive and fine.<br /><br />Besides the new powers that some of the characters have, you also get the iconic backgrounds from the film series. The villains follow the series of villains from the movies, so it truly captures the Star Wars theme.<br /><br />Honestly, I am underwhelmed with the game. To me, it's like Episodes 1 - 3 after experiencing 4 - 6 and knowing that it's already been done better.

But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God\\" (I Cor. 2:9, 10). \\"Through faith we understand\\" (Heb. 11:3). Spiritual understanding is not, therefore, dependent upon human sagacity or learning; it depends only on the teaching of the indwelling Spirit. Possessing this Biblical testimony, misunderstanding at this point is without excuse.<br />Since the Spirit is given only to those who are saved through faith in Christ, they alone are able to receive the particular body of truth which the Spirit teaches. Neglect of this fundamental, unalterable fact is the key-error of all modernism. The first step in spiritual understanding is the knowledge of God as Father. \\"Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him\\" (Mt. 11:27). \\"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\\" (John 17:3)<br />Modernists content themselves with borrowing some ideals from the Bible while reserving the right to reject whatever is not desired. Those portions which are acceptable to the unregenerate mind are received and taught as being authorative on the basis of the fact that these ideals are in the Bible. Here, indeed, is strange inconsistency on the part of men who pride themselves on their scientific reasonings. The unsaved preacher or teacher, being able to comprehend only the ethical teachings of the Scriptures, is a living proof of the truthfulness of the divine Testimony. He cannot see the kingdom of God. He sees nothing of the glories ofdivine grace -- the things of the Father, the things of Christ, the things of the Spirit, and things to come. He blindly ignores every dispensational division of the Word of God and is, therefore, free within himself to draw material from the kingdom teachings of Christ and from the law of Moses while constructing his world-improvement, sociological theories which he imposes on a Christ-rejecting world. Men of this character are sufficiently numerous in this day of apostasy to be responsible for the present day impression that the sole objective of Christianity is the improvement of human conduct. Being blind to the real principles and purposes of saving grace, they teach that it makes little difference what is believed, it is the life that counts. Against this is the overwhelming testimony of the Word of God that every aspect of salvation and every blessing of divine grace in time and eternity is conditioned only on what is believed. Influenced by these misunderstandings concerning the Truth, few serious-minded young men will choose to enter the ministerial profession; for it would mean the assumption of the role of a mere moralist. Common modesty generally precludes such an assumption. On the other hand, when the essential message of Christianity is seen to be the measureless, transforming grace of God with all of its eternal glories in the new creation in Christ, it is a challenge to the deepest impulses of the heart, and offers a ministry for which one may well sacrifice all. Christians are ambassadors for Christ and are commissioned to preach the Gospel to every creature. This ministry does not consist in either the education or the moral improvement of lost men while they are on their way to hell; it is the proclamation of the mighty, redeeming, transforming grace of God which offers eternal life and eternal glory to all who will believe. If it shall please God to use this exposition in any measure to the unfolding of the riches of His grace, the labor expended in its preparation will not have been in vain. This very inadequate treatment concerning the grace of God is committed to Him that He may in some way use its message to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.\\"<br /><br />Likewise, the terms upon which men may now be saved and thus receive the Spirit are as clearly defined in the Scripture. Salvation is by grace through faith. It is the result of the transforming work of God for man, and not the result of the work of man for God. It is that which God does for the one who trusts the Saviourhood of Christ. By that trust, Christ is personally received as the divine, Redeemer who shed His blood as a sufficient ransom for the guilt and penalty of sin, as the One who reconciles by having taken away the sin of the world, and as the divine Propitiation who, as Substitute, met every indictment brought against the sinner under the holy government of God.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It performs well, works great and I havent had any issues with my system at all. I couldnt be more pleased.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|Review of FIIO  E7, March 30, 2012.<br /><br />I received the FIIO E7 a few weeks ago. I unboxed it and the unit felt solid and substantial in my hand.<br /><br />I connected it to my laptop (HP 6715b with Windows Vista 32bit installed). The unit detected immediately and in a few seconds it was charging. After letting it charge a few minutes, I switched the charging unit to a Blackberry wall charger since both use the same USB connector. The unit charged normally and I let it charge overnight.<br /><br />The following day, I removed the unit and looked at it closer. There has been some criticism about the lack of proper instructions and manual. I can only say that in reading the instructions and playing with the menu, I quickly learned what I needed to do. Maybe, being an IT manager at the office, I have learned the fine art of deciphering oddball instructions one gets with equipment.<br /><br />So for testing, I used 4 head phones, Sennheiser HD-280 Pro, Sennheiser HD201s, Sennheiser PX100 (after I replaced the ear foam, a common issue with these headphones) and a newly arrived Audio-Techinca ATH-M50s.<br /><br />Except the Audio-Techinca, each headphone has been broken-in from countless hours of use in listening to music, movies and TV shows. Except for the PX-100, none of the headphones have ever been on a plane with me. The PX-100 are great headphones but lousy for air travel since they do not isolate from engine noise and everyone with touching distance can hear what you are listening too. Just hope their taste is the same as yours.<br /><br />The source was the above mentioned laptop with my collection of MP3s. According to my friends, music-wise, I am trapped in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Occasionally, I venture into the 50's, 90's and 2000's. So you can guess what I listen to. For those uninitiated for those years or whom history was a struggle, the music is pop, rock, and disco.<br /><br />I set the E7 to volume level 15 and equalization setting 0. This is agood listening level for me for testing. Eventually for my personal use, I reset the equalization to level 3.<br /><br />With each headphone, the E7 gave a much better sound. Each had different amount of bass but whether it was bass light or bass heavy, each headphone's bass was tight and well-defined. Well-defined to me is closing my eyes and can I identify the instrument(s) being played. Not scientific, but does not require tons of equipment.<br /><br />Midrange was rich and well-defined with each headphone. In the close-your-eyes test, you can hear the richness and full body of music coming out. Naturally each headphone had different levels of midrange, but each exhibited the fullness midrange offers.<br /><br />Treble was not overemphasized and distinct with each headphone. However, each had no distortion in the treble range. I tested this by elevating volume levels to see when distortion would occur to my ears. So unless I listen at ear-shattering levels, distortion will be no problem. Since I do not want to go deaf, I never do that for prolonged periods.<br /><br />I guess I need to make this less techie, I listened to the same song unamplified and amplified. I chose Mason William's Classical Gas. Unamplified, the iPhone 4S emphasized the upper range with loss of bass in the music. With the amp, what you get is more even level across the board. No one area was overpowering. The bass, midrange and trebles blended together as it should and the result was an enjoyable music. Almost to the point if I close my eyes, I can just hear the skin of his fingers plucking each string.<br /><br />To test its ability to travel, I took it with on a recent trip across the country. Like anyone who sits in economy, I struggled to make sure I had everything in my pockets and not someplace under the seat in front of me or in overhead. Accompanying with me was the FIIO L3 connector to iPods, iPhones and iPads. The connector just plugged right in to my iPhone and we were operational. The headphones were the newly arrived Audio-Techinca ATH-M50s and whatever music resided on my iPhone.<br /><br />Without music playing, the headphones reduced the engine noise a little bit but not like ANC-type headphones. But once the music started, I felt I had my own concert hall. The jet noise disappeared and I was listening from the horns in Chicago's Beginnings to the tight drums from Tavares' Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel. I also listened Leann Rimes' Amazing Grace in acappella (see I told you I sometimes get out) which is a test of the clarity of vocals for any headphones. Her voice was clear, crisp as if she was sitting next to me singing.<br /><br />It made for a more pleasant trip enveloped in a deep rich enjoyable music. I have not tested it extensively with movies, but I do know the E7 brings alive my headphones to a level almost as if I was sitting in my favorite chair listening to my Sennheiser H414V hooked up to my Kenwood KX-9100 integrated amp using my Technics SLQ2 turntable listening to Boz Scaggs Silk Degrees in vinyl. CDs do not offer the dynamic range vinyl offers but this is pretty good. Not audio heaven, but definitely getting up there.<br /><br />Note for those will use it with an iPhone, I noticed that randomly the music would drop and cut out and then come back. I finally realized that every time I received email, this would happen. The Iphone is my work phone.  So be aware when you do this. I have not tested this to see if this happens on an iPad. I have not read about this anywhere so I wrote this so if you buy one, do not think your unit is broken or malfunctioning when this happens. Since I do not get text messages on my iPhone, I don't know what happens.<br /><br />Battery life seems to be good. I have not wall charged it since I got it, but then I have connected it a lot to my laptop at work so it is getting charged. I will say it lasted with no problems on LA to Atlanta flight (Redeye in the middle seat). The headphones were the ATH-M50 and while they are not travel headphones, they folded well enough to make it work.<br /><br />Since buying this unit, I know the new E17 has arrived and based on what I have read, it has significant improvements from the E7. If that is the case, then the E17 should be pretty good.<br /><br />However, my final conclusion is that while the E17 is probably the better unit, you cannot go wrong with the E7.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />The unit is still working and I had a chance to see how well the battery worked. It was not the way I wanted to but it was a very good test. The test you ask? I was stuck due to weather at Atlanta Airport for 7 hours. The E7 kept humming in addition to the 3 hour flight that I finally left on. So it was on for 10 hours straight and was still cooking when I landed!!!
0785163174|3.0|* * * INTRO * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />Avengers Vs X-Men is the culmination of a long and intricate Marvel macro-saga that started in the year 2004 with Avengers Disassembled and continued with House Of M, Messiah Complex, Second Coming and The Children's Crusade (and pretty much every other Marvel event from Civil War to Schism, though those mentioned before are the most relevant ones to AVX, as they deal directly with the Scarlet Witch and Hope). But AVX not only is the culmination of an entire age of Marvel events, it also sets the stage for a new era of storylines that start with the \\"Marvel NOW!\\" initiative.<br /><br />* * * CONTENTS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />This volume includes:<br /><br />- Avengers Vs. X-Men #0 to 12 - This is the main series, where pretty much everything happens.<br /><br />- AVX: VS #1 to 6 - Each issue of this series features two 10-pages long short stories \\"expanding\\" fight scenes from the main series. Nothing really relevant happens here, it's only fight scenes, some of them pretty good, but others a little weak and irrelevant.<br /><br />- Avengers Vs X-Men: Infinite Comics #1, 6 and 10 - Now for the first time in print, this issues were originaly released only in digital form, serving as prologues to issues #1, 6 and 10 of the main series respectively, as those are turning points in the story. (NOTE: These three issues are the only ones ever created for the Infinite Comics series, don't mind the interrupted numbering, issues #2, 3, 4, etc, DON'T EXIST)<br /><br />- Point One - A 7-pages short story introducing the new Nova character for the first time. This story acts as a prologue to the AVX series. Point One originally featured seven different short-stories, but only this one is printed here, as the rest of them are not related to the AVX event.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: AVX had a lot of tie-ins running in other ongoing series, such as Avengers, New Avengers, Secret Avengers, Uncanny X-Men and Wolverine & The X-Men. Those tie-in issues are NOT INCLUDED in this volume. Don't worry, they are not really necessary to understand the story, as most of them rather focus on characters and situations of those specific ongoing series.<br /><br />* * * ABOUT THE STORY * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />I'll try to be as objective and spoiler-free as I can. This event is written by Brian Bendis, Jason Aaron, Ed Brubaker, Matt Fraction and Jonathan Hickman. All of them plotted the whole series and then each of them wrote the script for 2 (or 3, in some cases) individual issues. The Infinite Comics issues are written by Mark Waid with Ives Bigerel, and the short stories from AVX VS feature Jason Aaron, Matt Fraction, Kieron Gillen, Rick Remender, Jeph Loeb, Christopher Yost, Kathryn Immonen, Kaare Andrews and Steve McNiven.<br /><br />About Avengers Vs X-Men (main series): Issue #0 features two short stories, one focusing on the Scarlet Witch, the responsible for the near extinction of the mutant race and the other one features Hope, the first mutant to be born after the near extinction event caused by the Scarlet Witch. These two are going to be major player in the story, that's why they are introduced here. Issue #1 pretty much sets up the story: the Phoenix Force is coming to Earth and no one is safe. The X-Men lead by Cyclops think that Hope, the \\"Mutant Messiah\\", is destined to channel the Phoenix and kickstart the rebirth of the mutant race. However, the Avengers and Wolverine (who is leading his own team of X-Men) think that the arrival of the Phoenix can only mean the obliteration of our planet and want to stop it from reaching Hope. The problem comes with issues #2 to 5: they are a complete mess of inconsequentional fight after fight, which are cut in the middle of the action to then be ill-expanded in the respective AVX VS issues. This hurts the sense of narrative in a very serious way. I love action as anyone else (and expect it from this particular title), but this is completely senseless action and does no good to the book.<br /><br />With issue #6 the story picks up: there's a major turning point, the writers start to put more meaning into the action and the narrative improves as well (the battles are much better accomplished and the AVX VS complements stories are well-designed to expand them without hurting the narrative so much). I won't tell what happens in issue #6, but suffice to say that the conflict between the Avengers and the X-Men escalates exponentially.<br /><br />The last 3 issues of the series take the conflict to its climax, setting up the stage for a new status quo in the Marvel Universe, at least for short-term and maybe medium-term future (probably in the same way Avengers Disassembled and House Of M did a few years ago). The problem with the resolution of the story is that it becomes a bit predicatable and feels too editorially-driven. There are some shocking events nearing the end of the book, but they aren't surprising at all: maybe event after event, year after year, developed a numbing effect to this kind of shocks and nothing surprises anymore.<br /><br />* * * ABOUT THE ART * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />John Romita Jr. illustrates the 5 first issues of the series, and they are the most unattractive of the whole book. I usually like (even love) Romita Jr.'s art, but in this case his pages look very rushed and uninspired. Fortunately issues 6, 7 and 11 are illustrated by Oliver Coipel, and issues 8 to 10 and 12 by Adam Kubert. Both of them do a great job, showcasing beautiful art and raising the bar of the series immediately.<br /><br />Additional art in the AVX VS series and Infinite Comics feature a cast of notable artists, including: Ed McGuiness, Stuart Immonen, Adam Kubert, Steve McNiven,  Leinil Yu, Salvador Larroca, Terry Dodson, Brandon Peterson, Kaare Andrews, Tom Raney, Carlo Barberi and Reilly Brown. Many of them are well-known stars and deliver high quality performances, so you won't be disappointed with their art.<br /><br />* * * ABOUT THE EDITION * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />POSITIVE aspects:<br />+ This is an over-sized hardcover edition (with larger trim size than standard comic-books).<br />+ It's a high quality book, with glossy paper stock and excellent printing quality: colors are vibrant and line art is sharp.<br />+ Extras include 9 pages of pencil pages, sketches and designs by the main artists and a 4-pages \\"Scorecard\\" with a well-designed index of all the battles accross the book. There's also a 2-pages introduction by WWE Champion CM Punk.<br />+ This edition includes a code to be redeemed for a FREE Digital Copy if you use the Marvel Comics app. (Unfortunately I can't give you any insight about this feature, because I don't use the Marvel Comics app).<br /><br />NEGATIVE aspects:<br />- This is NOT a sewn-binding book. This hardcover features a glued-binding and this causes gutter loss that prevents from fully appreciating the art in double-page spreads. The book still reads well and the binding is solid, so it will last for a very long time, but with an expensive $75 edition, one would expect the highest quality standards of the Marvel Omnibus line.<br />- The variant covers are NOT reproduced in full-page size, instead we get a gallery that showcases 4 variant covers per page. These covers are illustrated by some top talent artists like Jerome Ope&ntilde;a and Esad Ribic among many others, so they'd deserve to be printed in full size so one could appreciate the detail properly.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE:<br />The issues are NOT presented in chronological order. They are printed in the following order: Point One's Nova story, Avengers Vs X-Men #0 to 12, AVX #1 to 6, Avengers Vs X-Men Infinite Comics.<br /><br />* * * CONCLUSION * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />Avengers Vs X-Men could have been an epic series, but in the end I can't help but feel it formulaic and flawed. I really wanted to enjoy the series and had high hopes in the star-ensemble of writers, featuring veteran Marvel architects like Bendis and Brubaker and promising newcomers like Aaron and Hickman, but in the end there's not really a lot of difference between AVX and other Marvel events like Siege or Civil War: rushed action, some out of character depictions and incidents for editorial sake. However this story has its positive aspects also: I think it sucessfuly closes a lot of loose ends and brings closure to the 9-years of continued events that Bendis inaugurated with Avengers Disassembled, while setting up a new and promising status for the Marvel Universe, for both Avengers and X-Men franchises. In the end Avengers Vs X-Men is just a \\"good\\" story: it's not bad at all, but it doesn't really excel in any aspect. It could have been epic, but it just limits itself to decently tell a story in order to set up a new stage for new stories in the Marvel Universe.artists, including: Ed McGuiness, Stuart Immonen, Adam Kubert, Steve McNiven,  Leinil Yu, Salvador Larroca, Terry Dodson, Brandon Peterson, Kaare Andrews, Tom Raney, Carlo Barberi and Reilly Brown.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Now I know what all of the talk was about. Really enjoyed the constant action. I can't wait to start book 2
B003QJME5G|5.0|Temp is pretty accurate, looks really cool, no issues thus far and it does exactly what it says it dos.<br /><br />Lot of options as well. Change the color of the lcd, an alarm in case you have it dialed low or something and it heats up, and an option to change from C or F.
034580404X|5.0|I had heard about the book very little & was curious about it, so I was walking in a store one day & on impulse bought the set. I began reading that day & have to say that I hated to put it down for even a moment. My heart just bled for this poor little boy, then the teenager, then the man. No child should have to go through that, at any age. He was strong willed & minded to make so much of himself at such a young age. He didn't let the horrors from stopping him from accomplishing his goals, then to want to do so much good with it. He was taught by the troll, but he learned more from Anastasia than the troll could ever teach. I had never read anything about bondage only seen snippets in comedies and such, but was quite intrigued at the methods. I applaud E L James for this beautiful story of two beautiful people. Anastasia brought Christian from the deepest darkest part of hell into the brightest light & gave him something no one else had ever done, more...
B001BEG2LK|5.0|Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight start strong and Powerslave and Rime of the Ancient Mariner finish it nicely.  This was definitely a classic album of Maiden at their peak.  The tour for this album was recorded for, [[ASIN:B000063DHK Live After Death]] one of the best live metal albums of all time.  Bruce's voice is strong, the bass is thundering, and the solos are blistering.  This is a great head banging album.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Ig am not a real avid role playing game person, but this is a game that got me sweating!!!! That never happens.. WOW ! I loved it.
B009JNXK88|5.0|it is really fun. kinda a cross between mega man and double dragon. play it! object of the game is to retrieve briefcases and kill the mad scientists. and it gets more challenging and addicting as you get further. highly recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|keeps ya busy while waiting if you like puzzle games.  colorful and fun.  good for a 10 inch tablet.  small for phones
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I received this in time for my daughters birthday. It completed the set I bought of seasons 1-6. You should have seen my daughters look on her face when she got this. Great price and fast delivery.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is one of the best books I read by John Grisham in a while. You think you have the plot figured out, and then there is a sudden twist, it was a very good read. I love it.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|I was halfway through this movie before I figured out it was supposed to be taking place immediately after the events of Casino Royale, and constituted a sequel to that storyline. That's pretty sad. The editing was so abrupt and choppy that I had a hard time figuring out the bad guy's motive or why the girl was so pissed. I say \\"the girl\\" because she was an utterly forgettable Bond femme - tragic backstory, quest for vengeance, yadda yadda. Miss Fields had a little more chemistry with Bond, but she's barely in the movie. The real \\"Bond girl\\" of this film was M. It should have been about their relationship, and the way they rebuild (or don't) broken trust on both sides - but again, the writing was so poor that what should have been the emotional meat of the story was bland and overcooked. The actors did the best they could with what they had to work with, but it was rough going. I liked the revelation regarding Vesper's boyfriend - but the story's tension fizzled out with, again, poor editing. The camera just left the scene and then, bam, resolution via dialogue. Or not.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|Daughter was very happy with the dvds for her birthday. I received them faster than expected. They also were a great price and in great condition.
0575081961|5.0|Terry Pratchett is one of the most allusive authors around, although even if you don't understand his allusions, his books make fun reading.  But the underlying allusions here have all to do with fantasy quests, heroes, villains, and innocents abroad caught in the adventures.  The title is exactly right, since after this it will be hard to ever read a \\"serious\\" sword and sorcery fantasy.  The only other book I know of that comes close to destroying this same genre is Mary Gentle's \\"Grunts,\\" in which the Forces of Evil win the \\"final battle.\\"<br /><br />You don't need to know the plot, since it, although like everything Pratchett, is stolen (the imminent end of the world) and yet transformed by his wonderful sense of humor.  What you need to know is that the \\"cast of thousands\\" contains a large number of very funny people, witty quips, sly allusions, and sometimes falling down funny social commentary.  Even his Evil Lord is self-consciously aware of the ridiculous constraints of the genre, and in his own way is a \\"hail fellow, well met\\" of sorts.  And he makes merciless fun of \\"the gods,\\" which would scare me.<br /><br />Get it, read it, chuckle, laugh.  You'll never read another \\"Conan\\" book without thinking of Cohen the Barbarian at his most outrageous.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Should be mandatory reading for all baseball fans who think they understand the game. Michael Lewis is a great writer who brings you into the mind of those who understand the game better than the \\"experts\\"
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have a couple of different email providers, one of which is 'Yahoo\\".<br />All are basically the same, messages sent to me at that address I receive.<br />As long as that basic function works dependably .. I am a happy human.<br />The simpler and clean the webpage .. the better. If I want news, weather or internet searches .. I go to a different sight.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In true Grisham fashion the plot is tightly woven, characters are well-developed and the plot moves quickly. Unlike many of his other novels, however, this plot has some interesting twists and turns which made it all the more fun to read.  About the time I thought I had my head wrapped around the plot and how it was going to unfold, Grisham would throw the reader a curve ball.
B008OOYALE|5.0|i have been playing it for months and it's still addicting.<br />it rewards you properly and makes it well worth playing
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I like Blue Ray DVD the picture clarity is outstanding. The Hulk was menacing and Hulkish. The combo is outstanding. Fans of action super hero movies will really like this movie format. A good purchase
B001NOAJVW|3.0|I really like the idea of having a mirror when  biking since I do a lot of biking on the road and we all know how bad drivers are when it comes to cyclists. The only thing I don't like about this product is that the mirror is so tiny that it is hard to see the cars coming up on you so it takes your eyes off the road for too long.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Works very well on the Kindle Fire. A well designed deck of cards with smooth animations. And I can't stop.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|Suspenseful, articulate and absorbing.  Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors.  Read this book and you will be hooked on Follett books.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|A Boy was tought to be Metal and learned how to make his dad to not be a loser anymore. Reminds me when I was a kid, and my dad smoked meth all the time, and if this Hesher guy existed, he'd help my dad not be a loser, and kick his ASS lol. Hesher rules.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Looking for high courtroom drama?  This ain't it.  However, you get an incredible look at the Federal system and a rousing scheme that the folks doing it actually get away with.  Oh yes, the bad guy does get it in the end.  Superb and surprising twists and turns.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Look, the game itself rocks. I got it on my iPhone but wanted a large screen version for when I'm not taking a dump. Effin Star Wars brow. However, this game is LAGGY AS BALLS. The developers need to correct this ASAP, which I'm sure they will. Get the game when the lag is resolved. And FYI I have a Kindle Fire. It took maybe 5-7 min to begin downloading, so be patient.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|The movie had tense moments but overall was hilarious.<br />I would recommend this movie to family and friends if I<br />knew they could handle the violence.
0486266885|5.0|This book is a really good book the plot is good for the time when it was created. It is a very good book but some parts are confusing and some what boring but there aren't a lot of those in the book. The real thing is people dis this book because its not scary enough well they have to know this in the time it was made it was scary. That is all i have to say about this good book.
B009ZQAN9I|1.0|Lame. Lacks thought.  Sorry I wasted the money and most of all my time watching!  My six year old daughter could think of a better story line. I want my money back!!
B009186JYI|3.0|First off, this is a movie about The Rolling Stones!!! I thought this was going to be a sequel to \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\"!!!<br /><br /> Okay, I just had to get that out of my system. But seriously folks, watching this movie is a lot like watching old 8mm movies of your kids and grandkids. And, I really don't mean that in an unkind way, but that's just the way I see it. Lets face it, there just isn't too much film out there featuring Brian Jones and it's worth the small price of this movie to see and hear Brian talking. I haven't watched the Directors cut yet, but the main feature clocks in under 1 hour. Maybe 15 or 20 minutes is the Stones in action. Another 15 to 20 minutes of interview clips with the band. The rest is comments from the teenage fans, way too much of that! Never-the-less, every true die hard Stones fan will want to own this movie! For the same reasons that we will never get rid of our old 8mm family movies!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is an entertaining book that is thoroughly messed up, but in a good way.  I liked the division of the books into different viewpoints and consequently your view of the characters is significantly altered.
B008IZYWXU|2.0|I m a little disapointed by the work done on this product, I was hopping a wonderfull background sound, and it is very close to what was done 25 years ago, so what the point????<br /><br />If you don't have the original, it s a good product, but if you have it , it's gonna be a waste of money
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am adicted to Angry Birds and this new chapter is beyond great. It's challenging enough so that you do have to work out rhe destruction. The new character concepts are so interesting. Love using the force with the black bird. Can't wait to find Vader.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is a really good movie. If you are into the Comic book genre this is one of the best. The Hulk kills in this movie!

B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not a great read, very repetitive and not well written.<br />Started with a great idea but missed to deliver, Too many clichés.
B001NPJGL0|5.0|In the future, I will probably purchase a 2' and 4' digital level, but for now my bubble levels work fine for those sizes. I purchased this in hopes it would replace my torpedo level. This thing works wonders. The short length lets it get in between hubs that my old level got hung up on. It gives you very exact measurements, allowing you to get precise slopes. The magnet on the level is strong enough to hold it in place firmly, but not as strong as some other levels. I haven't used the variety of features (and am not likely to), but it seems pretty full featured. I highly recommend it to someone looking to replace a torpedo level.
B008SVS3M0|5.0|John Hiatt is the most underated singer-songwriter ever, and he has been around for quite a while. John Hiatt's new album is no surprise for those who follow him. He just keeps getting better and better. Mystic Pinball is a terrific album, which by the way, does not contain the title cut. To get that song, you should purchase this disc  from his website, which will direct you to the Amazon site. Then you can download the song, \\"Mystic Pinball.\\" This album, like Hiatt's others, contain great rockers and ballads. John Hiatt is a singer-songwriter that will hook you once you have heard his metaphorical ballads and great rockers. You will not be disappointed with this disc.
B0092D1V5Y|5.0|it says that the app pretends to hack so I fell sorry for all of you people that left a bad review. LEARN TO READ!!?
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Wanted to go trough the trigoly event though the second book was dissappointing.<br />The books started with a good idea,  a different perspective on romance. But it failed so badly.<br />It is just a incredible amount of sterotypes, stupid dialogues and in the end failed to offer a new vision of modern relationships. Impossible to escape a prologue of &#34;happily ever after&#34;, where the girl finally gets her wish of a big wedding, two kids and a rich prince charming who along the way realizes that she is the one who will save him from his shallow existence. Pathetic... I am aways amazed that it seems there's only one role model for women. Find a rich husband, get married and breed. Everything in between seems irrevelant. Impossible to be a woman in charge of her own sexuality, exploring new possibilities in a less conventional relationship and having FUN. Well, II guess I'll keep searching ...
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This is well done. The picture is great. The story line is interesting. There are a few surprises. The ending will leave you wondering; \\"Don't trust ...\\" and what happens next?<br />I'm not sure what the point of certain parts; I will watch it again with some friends and we can figure it out.<br />If you like Science Fiction this is your movie.<br />Perhaps I've seen too many SF movies/ shows; it is hard to startle me anymore.<br />This one is above average. The blue ray version is well done.<br />I do not regret buying it. (I do have some movies that I regret.)
B0013F1D02|5.0|Great story. Great acting. Great movie.  Now in my favorite fantasy movie list alongside Princess Bride, Neverending Story, and Labyrinth.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love this movie! Very cute animation and songs. Great movie to teach kids the importance not destroying our environment! Although the story is a little different than the book (extended) I think they managed to keep the original message and would make Dr. Seuss proud!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book sucks you in slowly and keeps you turning pages well past your bedtime. Science Fiction at it's best - when's the movie?
B002UWH8SS|1.0|Why is everyone suddenly white men? SG-1 was much better. This series has eliminated all strong female and minority characters, with the only women serving as secondary to men. Boring, and sexist.
B00785P2QC|5.0|at first I thought it was boring. but then I got really intonation it. its really fun for anyone.you should try it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read for pleasure, but not science fiction.  My husband doesn't usually read for pleasure, but says he likes science fiction.  I saw Wool (OmEd) come up as the Kindle Daily Deal, saw the favorable ratings and bought it for him (it's hard to go wrong for $1.99).<br /><br />Like several of the characters in the book, I found myself driven by curiosity - so I started reading... WOW!  I don't want to drop any spoilers but I can safely say that this book was one of the best I've read.  I probably owe my employer a huge apology because I stowed my kindle in the desk drawer at work and sneaked chapters all week by opening the drawer and reading (and quickly closing it when anyone came along).  I'm sure my coworkers thought I'd become obsessed with counting my paperclips or something similar but so help me I could not put this one down.  I was even reading it at red lights in traffic!  This it the kind of book that will keep you pondering.  Most enjoyable!  I must say that having all five books in one document is a huge plus.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it reminds me of the old games at carnivals from when I was little. back when the simple times meant more than they do nowadays.
B0013NBBOW|5.0|Khan was a short lived British prog rock band. Space Shanty was the only album as far as I know but it is a beauty. It features some great guitar work from Steve Hillage and any album that has Dave Stewart on keyboards has a head start. The sound is Canterbury-based, and the album would appeal to Caravan and Hatfield and the North fans, but there is more than that here. Hillage was a great rock guitarist and some of the riffs are heavy. Accompanied by Stewart's screaming keyboards the band rocks. Nick Greenwood and Eric Peachey are a solid rhythm section. Space Shanty is one of the forgotten albums of prog but well worth checking out.
0307744434|1.0|The book is a cross between a soap opera romance, and interior design contest to the death.  The bad romance, I could handle that, but the contest being the main focus of the book Stay Away.  Well unless you want to read about a magical interior design contest.
0062220837|5.0|A gorgeous book, very pleasant to hold, and also small and light enough to fit my very small hands.  Books these days are so flimsy it's often frustrating to read them while trying not to break out sections, but this is a pleasure to crack open and leaf through, stopping to read my favorite parts over.  I am sure I will get a lot of pleasure out of this.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I just recently discovered HaleStorm, and really enjoy this CD.  Lzzy's vocals are amazing.  The CD reminds me of Heart back in the 70's and 80's.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the whole trilogy and i cant find anymore would love more editions. There are alot of shades but not with christian in them. i would love to have more books from the same author...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I have always had respect for the dedication and ability of the Seals and other similar military groups.  Now I have more.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|my 13 year old son loves this movie but there is death in the movie..which is ok for him but may not be for everyone.  Good movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Semi predictable.  We bought this as a gift since we have it and like it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very thoughtful, insightful reading; confirmed to me thing I had already felt about the afterlife. The subject matter was presented in a scientific manner but also perceptive manner. Thank you Dr Alexander for writing this book.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book soooooo much. It got a little muddy in the middle, but that's to be expected because the main character is also confused in this part. Everything gets explained in the end and it make a wonderful relief that as a reader we don't have to wait for the next book to come out in May to figure out what happened. I hope that this series doen't end in a trilogy, but continues way past that because that's how good the reading is. I finished this book within a week (considering work and college). Loved every mintue of it and even got my friend hooked on it too. This is an awesome series to read if you enjoy The Fifty Shades Trilogy.
B000009CTM|4.0|Bought this classic for my kids to watch on long car rides.  I enjoyed this movie when I was younger and now my kids enjoy it.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Despite the fact that Ms. Lennox has a \\"disclaimer\\" disavowing herself from any religious affiliation to Christianity, she still gives us a stunningly beautiful collection of what is obviously Christian-based spiritual and secular Christmas music.  One has to ask, is it not like she is saying, \\"here are a few of my favorite songs from my childhood that I used to sing and yet I no longer ascribe to their roots, their message or their sources. Still, in the spirit of the season, I hope to cash in on this special Holiday nonetheless\\". The addition of the African Children's Choir is moving, apropos, and is the icing on the 'universal' cake.<br />  As a huge fan of Annie Lennox's music, and despite the obvious hypocrisy of the disclaimer which could have just as well been left off the label, I highly recommend this collection of Christmas classics. Sung and performed by one of the greatest voices EVER, this haunting, lilting, and yet modern rendition of classic favorites will remain untainted by the artist's lack of faithful affiliation.  Barbara Streisand did the same thing (she's Jewish and she observes Christmas?), as did George Winston, following the secular habit of including an unfortunate and shallow disclaimer on record label, blatantly rejecting Christmas, its traditions, and founding Religious ideologies, while still hoping to make bank on basically someone else's religious affiliation. Just because much of our formerly Christian world has lost its way, perhaps Ms. Lennox's contribution to the vast collection of Christmas music will enhance someone's faithfully observed Christmas season.  It certainly has done so to mine, and this is the second CD I'm ordering as I lent my first one and never got it back! Irony in that to be sure.
B00984668E|4.0|This album see's the band sit back in the pocket a bit more than their previous release, which they seemed to branch out a little. I don't mean this in a bad way, the Sword have found their groove and sound content to riff this album than to noodle. This album also marks a return of some slooooow tempo stuff we haven't heard since the first album. Now the only negative I can say is that they do miss Trivett Wingo on the drums. The replacement sounds good but doesn't play with the intensity or creativty Trivett did. Sounds restrained at times, maybe I'm just critical because he was one of my favorite drummers.  Be sure to get the deluxe version as the live tracks are good and the ZZ Top cover is worth the price of the alum. Once several years ago after a Sword show I told them they were the best electric blues band from Texas since ZZ Top and they had a good chuckle. But these nasty dogs and funky kings bring the texas boogie like no other!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I bought this for a holiday and didn't sleep all night reading it the night before we left. World war z is a fantastically well thought through book, it suspends disbelief and takes us on a journey looking at every aspect of the war. A must read.

B009FBX5M0|2.0|Clearly Thomas Newmann was not a good choice for this movie.  The soundtrack is rather disappointing.  I could not point to a single track as my favorite.  I also do not understand why they excluded the theme song by Adele from the album.  Adele was invited to compose/sing this theme song by the studio and she has released it under the same label (Sony).  Why would they leave out theme song from a James Bond soundtrack?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  So they excluded the only good track from the album.  If I had known earlier, I would not have ordered this album at all.  Save your money.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I signed up for this product on my Android tablet but every thing I tried to load it kept saying, load it on my computer instead and that is not what I wanted to do.

B009JNXK88|5.0|its great fun and addicting. no problems running or playing. also responsive no lag when I press buttons. love this game. highly recommend
B008OOYALE|3.0|Game is great, but rates for better dragons needs to be increased.  There is no cancel button so the only way to change breeding is to use gold.  It costs 1 gold per hour to remove common dragons that take upwards of 16 hours to breed.  Good games don't make you have to spend money.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am enjoying. playing. this. game. It is cute and addictive. I even got my nephew playing it. The goals are realistic some are easier some are harder but so far fair. If you like the &quot;Story&quot; games you will like this one. Great game
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran is very funny! She touches upon issues I have thought about briefly but while reading the book I have time (and Moran urging me) to delve deeper into how I really feel about it. I have suggested this book to all of my friends, guys may be uncomfortable with some parts, but if they have a sense of humor they will enjoy it too!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Definitely my favorite alarm app. Like naming my alarms.  Like the graduating volume of alarms. Works perfectly. Easy to set up each alarm.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The great advantage of this cable over the original is that the cord detaches and can be plugged into a USB port on a computer.  And you can still use it on a wall outlet.  Best of both worlds.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I'm very picky about music, so I often find myself only listening to one or two songs on an album (iTunes and Amazon have made that possible, for better or worse). However, Night Visions is a fantastic album, which I generally play when I know I have enough time to kill to listen to every track. I don't pretend to be a music expert, so I won't try to analyze lyrics or harmonies or any of that. This upbeat and album simply resonates with me.
B00846REIS|3.0|Before hearing about this book, I read the Fifty Shades books. After reading this I feel as if this book is much to similar to that collection of books. I really like the way that Sylvia Day writes and she makes you want to keep reading. I just wish this book seemed more original than it seemed the whole time.

We recommend her debut album to those who like Irish Jigs.... but with a dance beat cross over.

B0085FF55W|4.0|Family Of The Year is a Los Angeles-based indie band, fronted by singer/songwriter/guitarist Joe Keefe and his brother Sebastian on drums, bringing sunny, upbeat, acoustic guitar-driven music. Last we heard from FOTY was the great 2011 EP \\"St. Croix\\". Now comes the band's second album (after 2009's \\"Our Songbook\\").<br /><br />\\"Loma Vista\\" (11 tracks; 39 min.) starts off with the rousing \\"The Stairs\\", followed by an even harder-charging \\"Diversity\\", one of my favorite tracks on here. Then comes the breezy \\"St. Croix\\" (from last year's EP), which is as smooth as silk. \\"Buried\\" sounds like the band singing on a beach around a bonfire (with fun lyrics like \\"Bury me with my guitar/bury me with my T-shirt/bury me with my Chucks\\", ha!). \\"Hero\\" is a pensive tune from Joe, mostly solo on acoustic guitar, a beautiful song. \\"Living on Love\\" (also from last year's EP) is a rare track that brings electric guitar to the forefront. \\"Hey Ma\\" is a piano-fronted slower song, sounding great. \\"In The End\\" is what I would call the \\"standard\\" FOTY sound: gorgeous, with lots of vocal harmonizing. The album closer \\"Find It\\" brings Joe on acoustic guitar by himself to start, before the rest of the band joins in for a rousing finale. Great way to finish things off!<br /><br />In all, this is a most pleasing album! The album clips by in no time, covering 11 tracks in about 40 min., and you'll just find yourself playing this again and again. I had the good fortune of catching these guys live recently (opening for Walk the Moon) here in Cincinnati, and what a thrilling 45 min. set they brought, playing many tracks from this album. If you have a chance to see Family of the Year live, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \\"Loma Vista\\" is sure to end up in my \\"best of\\" albums of the year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

1451695195|4.0|I'm a fan of books like these, and NDE accounts in general, so this was a no-brainer (Ha! Sorry... just slipped out, really!) for me. This one is a very good story, and ultimately, if not essentially, a very personal one, filled with meanings and details unique to Alexander's deepest personal history, and relevant only to it. Which causes me no problems; how could it be otherwise? I don't think it will ever prove anything in any objective sense, tho, certainly not to all those who are still insisting that all such experiences prove nothing. Sam Harris (one of those folks, I guess) sums it up neatly and as far as I can tell from my reading, in a way that Alexander doesn't ever seriously address: (I'm paraphrasing, I hope accurately enough) Since Alexander's brain is working fine now, how badly could it really ever have been broken, despite the medical records? (Medicine, we learn from Harris, is NOT the same as Science) And no matter how broken, how can he prove that his mental experience didn't happen entirely in the final few minutes or even seconds as he came to, and only appeared to him subjectively to have taken place over a much longer time? Alexander himself speaks of how time was virtually meaningless during most of it, and the few links he finds in it to timed events in this world are all, of course, subjective. I don't need any such proofs to find his experience significant in the context of other such tales and meaningful to me; the proof is all in Alexander's life and heart as he experiences them now in the undying glow of what he recalls. He was blessed as far as I can tell. Seriously Blessed. And I'm grateful to him for sharing his blessing so cogently and entertainingly. But I do feel for him, as he tries to play out the bravado of his title and his conviction that his experience, happening as it did to a specialist such as himself, was perfectly designed to BE proof. I leave the hashing out of that to experts. What I see in it is the positively FATAL flaw of being perfectly \\"styled\\" to bring shudders of horror to Serious Intelligences such as Harris and the legions of the Skeptical, a class of persons, as far as I can tell, who live in unspoken terror of EVER being caught with anything even faintly whimsical or smirk-worthy in their hearts. How are these folks EVER going to get comfortable with an Angel in a peasant blouse riding with the author's soul over the fields of Heaven on a butterfly? Not in THIS Lifetime! I salute Alexander's courage in bringing this sweet image (presumably with the deepest honesty) out into the brutal world; I do NOT see a similar courage in the personas of today's public neuro-evangelists and professional academic materialists. I'm delighted not to be of that camp to whatever extent I actually am free of similar fears, and am grateful to Dr. Alexander for helping me (unintentionally?) to see this aspect of the whole Hard Question conflict in this revealing light. I think it cuts more deeply than many will acknowledge.<br /><br />Added 11/13/12:<br /><br />Harris just posted a much more thorough review of the book itself (google \\"Science on the Brink of Death\\") and it's as cogent and devastating as his fans will have expected. I hope Alexander responds somewhere, sometime, but as it is, it's an excellent summary of the \\"proof\\" problems NDEs present in general, and of Alexander's failure to deliver the goods, to the materialist scientific world. It also definitively demonstrates, I think, how this community insists on seeing our capacity for self-delusion as the ultimate obstacle to all and every positive or even meaningful conclusion that any NDE experiencer (or those that read them) might draw from their experience. No doubt these people feel that Science and Critical Thinking are our only bulwarks against self-delusion, and for them, as for Harris, Alexander's book is just another embarrassment for the human race, maybe even a CLASSIC in that regard. For those who sense that Scienceand Critical Thinking may just as easily be paths to delusion, or at least to erroneous conclusions no matter how apparently rational, or who, like myself, are simply fascinated by life-changing peak experiences of almost any sort, but particularly by those that suggest intriguing alternative visions of \\"reality\\", I'll continue to recommend it. (And to enjoy exercising my apparent freedom to carefully select the delusions I find most useful as I live my own life.)and Critical Thinking may just as easily be paths to delusion, or at least to erroneous conclusions no matter how apparently rational, or who, like myself, are simply fascinated by life-changing peak experiences of almost any sort, but particularly by those that suggest intriguing alternative visions of \\"reality\\", I'll continue to recommend it.

B008NB0SQO|1.0|I guess I'm joining the growing list of boycotters of this film since it's edited.... yet AGAIN!  Why does Big Brother (a.k.a. Disney) keep deciding what's not appropriate for us to watch by chopping up yet another established feature film (Pocahontas on blu-ray another case in point)?  If I were Brian Henson, I would be livid!  Is this the future of the Star Wars legacy, too, now that Disney owns Lucasfilms? Maybe I should start shopping for an old Laserdisc player and find \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" in that format so I can finally see the complete, unedited film in widescreen... Good Grief!
B000024KRO|5.0|I was just looking around on here and when I passed by this great CD from 96, I was shocked that there was only one review posted. This is one of Deep Purple's best Studio albums and it was their rebirth. It came out just 3 years after their last implosion with Ritchie Blackmore. Their tour with Blackmore in 93 had some tremendous performances, but by tours end, they had fallen apart once again, and Blackmore refused to finish the tour dates in Japan. So they got Joe Satriani for a year then in late 94 recruited the Guitar Master Steve MOrse. Well their first recording with Him was the rebirth of Deep Purple, and its this CD. Every song is either great or good. The only song that I did not find strong was Soon Forgotten. But it has grown on me over the years. But the first song is just molten hard rock. Ted the Mehanic, which has subsequently become a regular track in concert. Loosen my strings, very good and melodic. Roger Glover's influence is obvious on that track. Sometimes I feel like Screaming is a classic Purple song with a bit of a more melodic tone to it and it contains fantastic vocals from Gillan and some great screams. Cascades, I'm not your lover, rings some bells in my personal life and is a solid rock number with some great dual note phrasing from Lord and Morse. Aviator a good song with accoustic type feel to it. Then my favorite track, Rosas Cantina. Just some awesome musicianship by every one. Lord is just unmatchable at times. Another great song is Hey Cisco, which is a show off song at very high speed. The other songs are all strong. I can remember when I first heard this CD I said, they are back and better than ever. I can't believe that was 16 years ago. They have since reestablished there world wide following with massive touring and 3 more studio recordings which are all good. But Purpendicular rivals the classic 70's records in quality. When I am in certain moods, its my favorite Purple record, now that is saying something. If you have not heard it. I highly recommend this recording.  Thanks for reading my review and Long live Rock.  Rick.

B004EYSXT8|3.0|Excellent information. Read it in an hour or so. Suffers from pages of triteness. And why use terms such as HSE? (Holy Shit Effect, sic) If a writer wants to be taken seriously, better to avoid such offensive terms. None-the-less, a helpful book for anyone interested in learning.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|See - I always knew Richard III was more hero than villain! Philippa Gregory explains she portrays him differently depending on who the protagonist of the book is, so I must try the others in this House of York series.  But no-one will convince me differently - I'm a Ricardian.  Found the book entertaining and informative, but have read better historical novels - enjoying Hilary Mantel's second Cromwell story at the moment, for example.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|The c.d. flows much like the prevoius c.d. done with Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer, but with a little more thunder. You can tell the four get along great in the studio and Gene and Paul are stress free at this time of their lives to record.<br /> First track sets the tone for the c.d. with \\"Hell or Hallujah\\" with an amped up Paul with strong hooks and  a kickin' beat. Pauls other tracks almost stay at the same level of excitment except for \\"Last Chance\\" ,a Paul jewel that you can't help but love. Gene's shining moment would be \\" Eat your Heart Out\\". His others are typical Gene except for a dumb/fun track called \\" Back to the Sone Age\\" which should of fitted nicely on a movie soundtrack-like an adult comedy. Tommy takes the reins on \\"Outta This Word\\" and doesn't let go . The track would be a great summer-time hit.Tommy delivers one of the strongest tracks next to Eric's \\"For The Love of Rock N' Roll\\". A real great sing a long with a cow bell bangin' to the cry of early KISS. And Gene and Pauls' duet on \\"Take Me Down Below\\" is good enough but doesn't measure up to their earier duets. Monster sounds like KISS and wants to be cranked up on commend.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I am a Clancy fan. This book tied in somehings that had me wondering about in his later novels. It is well paced with attention to characters classic of Tom Clancy. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.<br />A great read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm not much for jewel games, but I tried COA not knowing it was one. Decided to give it a try after anyway, when I found out, which was a good call because I basically played it till I had beaten it.
0345505387|2.0|Call it what you like, a graphic novel is a comic book.  I thought the character depictions of Jamie, and especially Claire -were bad.  Why wasn't Claire's hair more wild?  It's a cartoon, make her look like the invented character.  Not sure what I was expecting, but after reading 7 books, I wanted a visual of Jamie & Claire.  it didn't deliver.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I've been a Rock and Roll DJ for 38 years, I've been a mystic and a SEEKER  for 45 years. So I was very interested to find out what was the<br />true story of this influential and Iconic Rock Star who I've always loved.<br />I found him to be almost brutally honest. Or did he know when he talked about Mick's thick penis in that way it would make good quotes for the Press?<br />I did learn about some of his early trials and the demons it would cause in his life.<br />What I never did understand was his heartfelt feeling about some of the huge emotional landmarks in his life. So little on the death of Keith Moon and John Entwhistle. I was left to guess if that was really because he was at the point in his spiritual development where it didn't affect him.<br />And speaking of his spiritual path, he did let us know how much he had given to the Meher Baba folks. And I did kinda get where that led him to write some Great songs. But did it really ever Heal him, did it really led him to find what he was seeking???<br />I was really hoping to get some insight into the truth he found from all those years of seeking.<br />I didn't get the answers to what really brought him through his addictions, and what truly he felt about his girlfriends, wives, bandmates and his teacher.. Sooooo many details, maybe too many, and so little heart.<br />I am glad i read this, but sorry that I didn't get any clearer view of his heart and soul.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has so many games and options i play this everyday from starting off with the first games to now has been the whole time
B004S5BTD0|5.0|Hereafter is a different thought of what happens to you in the afterlife. If you can open up to this idea you might even think that this could happen. The woman who experienced death and the young boy searching for an answer about his brother kept you wanting to know more and stay involved in the story the whole way through. If you are closed minded skip this one.
B000024CND|5.0|the lyrics and music on this CD are just as applicable to today's world as when it was originally written and recorded -- do check out Super Tramp on You Tube -- there are concerts there and they were very statement oriented.  But being someone that loves lyrics they're one of my favorite groups!!!<br /><br />I think I have all Super Tramp's CD's and continually enjoy their music.
B007SGM084|4.0|Love the story, peeling back the layers on Christian is a trip.  The sex scenes are pretty predictable.  Would like to see a follow up to capitalize on Jose, Kate, Mia, Elliott and Ethan.  Maybe even Ray & Carla.
B000ZM1FXO|3.0|This movie is excellent and depicts Rome as it was.  Do yourself a favor and do not watch it with Amazon Instant Video. The video bounces all over, is of poor quality, and doesn't do this movie justice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thrilling suspenseful edge of your seat tv awesomeness !!!!! Once you've watched u will be hooked and addicted to the walking dead
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, makes you think a little bit and gets your brain moving. I like it because it's good for passing time if you are waiting at the doctors, or on a TV commercial or something. Fun free game!
B0015T6G2G|5.0|This is such an important book that everyone should read it.  It shows us the strength of an ordinary man who did extraordinary things.
B0030V0PEW|3.0|The Checklist Manifesto makes a great case for basing complex tasks--from conducting surgery to building skyscrapers--on the use of basic and more complex checklists. It would have been very helpful if the last chapter contained a guide or templates for constructing checklists as effective as the ones the author describes in generalities.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Classic man beats system John Grisham plot line! In the end, a little too predictable for him, so it doesn't earn the last star.  Still a great read.  If you've never read Grisham, start here and work your way back, you'll love it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Big Fish games have always been better than any others...this one is just beautiful in a scary way....and helps you when you wonder what needs to be done next, to get you moving onto the next mysterious happening.....very clever, and I just know I will be playing this game over and over..beautiful scenery, great music and like a good book, ya hate for it to end !!!!..Thanks Amazon, for bringing it to my Kindle Fire !!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The second season is great, uses a descent amount of story lines from the comic book, and the bonus features are really good.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellent as always full of incredible scientific information and a great ride all the way to the end...you have to read this one if you are a Scarpetta fan!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was highly disappointed with The Casual Vacancy. After reading the Harry Potter series, I was curious and excited to read an adult novel by J.K. Rowling. However, in the first few pages of the book, I was shocked by the amount of language and sexual content, as well as the drug scenes and dark plot. It seemed to me that J.K. Rowling was trying way too hard to reach an adult audience, and the ending was what I expected, but didn't want to expect. I do not recommend this book, especially to fans of Harry Potter or young adult readers. This definitely is not one of her finest works.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Very simple is what makes this game so much fun.  With only a few controls and only one mission it makes it easy to get into.  Wish there was a little more to the game.  Either way it is fun, fast, and addicting.
0375507256|5.0|Received the book before I expected it and it was in excellent shape. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Has a superior moral to the story. Takes a bit of intellect to be able to get through it but is well worth the trouble. Will be recommending this book to all I care about and hoping that the movie is half as good.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|This is one of my very favorite Smashing Pumpkins albums. It has many great songs and it a pleasure for me to listen to no matter what or when. I would recommend this album to any music lover or Smashing Pumkkin fan!!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|this book has got it all - history- philosophy- intrigue. well worth reading. stuff you want to and should know.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I was majorly disappointed in this latest Grisham book.  The story centers around a man, a lawyer, who is given 10 years in a federal prison for a crime he didn't commit - or wasn't aware of the crime he was commiting in a shoddy realestate money laundering scheme.  He gets himself out of prison early by solving the killing of a federal judge - is given the reward money - and taken into the witness protection program - cosmetic surgery the whole works.  But then the book got bogged down for me as this guy is all over the place - literally.  I lost interest and raced through the book to get to the predictable end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was excellent!  It started out a little slow for me, but I persevered  due to the ratings.  I am so glad I did!  It was one off those books I didn't want to put down...I found myself reading every spare minute I had.  You won't believe how the story twists and turns.  I can't wait to read the 2 other books by this author!
034580404X|5.0|The books are a great trilogy, I share them around the office and everyone is enjoying them. I definately got my money worth.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite shows of all time. HILARIOUS. I don't think there's a single episode that I didn't enjoy!
0547569653|5.0|Boots and all book and story.<br />Easy read with plenty of tips on nutrition and training without the preaching.<br />I'll read it again before my next big race.
B005LAII9O|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a former Navvy SEAL and Ben (Aaron Johnson), a talented chemist share two things. The best friends have one girlfriend O (Blake Lively) and they have a mutual love for marijuana. But these guys aren't just guys who have a couple of plants on their patio.<br />Chon smuggled some special seeds out of Afghanistan, and the strain of marijuana they have produced is particularly potent.<br />They have a state of the art growing facility, have hired computer hackers to hide their money and Ben has a longtime goal to stay overseas doing charity work.<br />But their business is so good they have attracted some very bad attention. A cartel enforcer Lado (Benicio del Toro) sends them a video of severed heads and a chainsaw. The Mexican cartel offers a solution, a partnership.<br />Chon, the more seasoned of the two, tells Ben the cartel will not take \\"no\\" for an answer. They meet, and then ask for time to think about it. They make plans to leave with O, and go to Indonesia for at least a year.<br />The cartel knows something is up, so kidnap O.<br />Chon and Ben go to a corrupt DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) who has turned a blind eye to their business in exchange for a cut. What he doesn't tell the boys is he's also in bed with the cartel.<br />They decide the only way to get O back is to strike at the cartel's business, and make it appear like it's an inside job. This is a tough, gritty crime thriller that only Oliver Stone could oversee.
1847879071|1.0|Unprofessional and immature was not something I would expect from a professor who is teaching people to become professionals seriously it's truly offensive.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was well written  you could smell the flowers. When ever it got to heavy you were told about a new delightful flower to cheer you up again. Didn't want the book to end.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's been awhile since Grisham has written a really good mystery, but this one was a good read. I enjoyed it.
B009JNXK88|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and kind of reminds me of super meat boy...  At least the gameplay does...  You play this small little manly dude who can super jump up walls and run at enemies until they die.  The goal of the game is to run at some scientists to death and collect briefcases.  I may have missed something but I was preoccupied (by pooping) during the cutscenes at the beginning.  The game can get challenging at times and requires some mad skills to navigate your man onto the right ledge and not to certain death....<br /><br />Overall this game is great for some casual bathroom gaming and is easily the best Amazon App of the Day that I've gotten since Cut the Rope!
B005MMY4SU|4.0|I enjoyed it.  I just wish they had continued the series.  It was a little slow at times but I enjoyed the drama.  The most disappointing character was Merlin.  I think they could have done so much more with him.
B0084QV2C2|5.0|I really love this book!!!<br />I think that this is the best book that I<br />Have ever read in my life!!<br />But you do have to read the authors note first before reading the actual book!.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Easy to read. Inspiring. No nonsense. I can't recommend this enough. The writers experience and passion shines through. I am now writing just because Amazon insist on a minimum number of words in reviews, Jason and David would appreciate my frustration.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|If you enjoyed 1Q84 by Murakami, read Cloud Atlas.  It combines just enough magic realism, sci-fi, and classic literature to meet the avid reader's needs.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This is a handy application to have. I have used it so much already. Well worth the price. Strongly recommend.
1451638450|3.0|How can I say this (no spoilers)?  I think Lois has lost her chops.<br /><br />We had that long hiatus with Sharing Knife.  So maybe she just wanted to try something really different.  And then Cryoburn might be forgiven as a \\"getting warmed back up\\" kind of novel.  It wasn't Mirror Dance but nothing is.<br /><br />(side rant) Does anyone else think Tej is the galactic version of what's-her-name in Sharing Knife?  Same silly idiosyncratic mannerisms (Ivan Xav Ivan Xav Ivan Xav...funny the first time), intermittent quivering helplessness, abused-position-in-the-family-power-structure, I don't do much but exist as an object of male desire plot purpose?<br /><br />Do authors read reviews?  If so, Ms. Bujold, here's my plea.  Leave Cordelia on Sergyar.  Let us merely imagine was Ista and Iselle and Ijada are up to these days.  Don't ruin them.<br /><br />Maybe it's just that the author is getting tired.  The typical Bujold is so brilliantly written that I would re-read sentences and paragraphs the first time through to savor them.  In CVA I was skipping pages.  Some of the conversational sequences are just amateur (vis Ivan with his first private in-law meet).  Except for the conversation that would take too much work and didn't happen (Lady Alys, the Baronne and her mama).  Writing a book of  The Paladin of Souls' caliber is hard hard hard labor.<br /><br />The original Vorkosigan novels are gravity wells that suck you in and keep you there.  Now we have the after-the-original-Vorkosigan novels.  And frankly I'm not sure I'll pre-order the next one in hardback.  I gave this novel 3 stars out of loyalty to the characters.  The author deserves 2.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Works very well on my Kindle Fire HD. I only wish it had voice input like on the iOS version.
0062220837|1.0|I love books! I view books as a work of art. Books inspire imagination, they allow you to learn and develop your comprehensive skills, and a high quality book is just beautiful to hold and admire. That said, many books (and this has been true for hundreds of years) are beautifully illustrated, and limited. This edition of the wonderful fairy tale by Neil Gaiman, \\"Stardust\\", is indeed limited. It is also signed, however there is NOTHING remotely \\"Deluxe\\" about it.<br /><br />First off, it's no larger than the normal \\"Gift Edition\\". The paper quality is nothing special. High quality paper is something you can feel in your hands, and is often thick. The paper in this \\"Deluxe\\" edition is on par with what you get in any \\"normal\\" book these days. Where is the book printed? I don't know, for some reason it was not stated which is a bit troubling, although admittedly that is the least of the problems here. How about illustrations? There is one frontispiece, which you also get in the normal Gift Edition. The beginning of each chapter has the same 2-color illustration (similar to a B&W illustration). This is the same thing you will find in the normal Gift Edition. So what is special about this \\"Deluxe\\" edition? The answer, not really anything. You get a slipcase, which is just a plane, unattractive blue cardboard box. You also get one sheet with Gaiman's signature. This edition is limited to 2000 signed copies. Now, 2000 copies may not sound like a lot, but it actually is. Most fine limited editions will be around 500, perhaps 1000 if there is high demand, however this is in no way a \\"fine limited edition\\", and although it is limited and it is signed, I don't think this signature and cheap slipcase are worth an extra $100, which is what it amounts to (currently this is $125, and retail is  $150). If this book was $50, I would say go for it. I personally could not be more disappointed in this edition. If you're looking for nice limited editions, you'll have to look for small-press books such as Centipede Press, or Subterranean Press. Those people know how to make beautiful, high-quality, limited editions, and you know what, many of their limited editions are not only beautifully illustrated, much higher quality than this edition, but substantially CHEAPER than this book!<br /><br />In summary: this is a normal mass-produced book, with a cheap slipcase and a single piece of paper with a signature inserted. This, does not a \\"Deluxe Limited Edition\\" make. Caveat emptor...ress books such as Centipede Press, or Subterranean Press. Those people know how to make beautiful, high-quality, limited editions, and you know what, many of their limited editions are not only beautifully illustrated, much higher quality than this edition, but substantially CHEAPER than this book!<br /><br />In summary: this is a normal mass-produced book, with a cheap slipcase and a single piece of paper with a signature inserted.

B005UDD1R6|5.0|Much better than the Kindle Fire's built in player. The only thing I've found that would make it better is the ability to reorder playlists. It lists alphabetically only. And when listing files with numbers, it orders them: 1, 10, 11, so on and then 2, 20, 21... Still, all in all, it is the best player I have found.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I had lots of fun with this. It was challenging enough to keep my attention but not so hard that I gave up. There's so much to do that it's almost like a new game everytime you play it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My family really enjoyed this! Can't wait to read it again!! I haven't read anything so good since the Harry Potter series!
B0031RS58I|4.0|The story was good and actually gotme thinking what eould I do in a similar situation. It was surprisingly good for chick lit and exactly what I needed after reading two heavier books. But in general I wouldn't read nly these kinds of books because they are so shallow in every aspect.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Explaining the unexplainable, an amazing experience that cannot be duplicated, is a nearly impossible task.  Dr. Alexander, nevertheless, tries to do so.  He has clearly had a remarkable experience that even his prolific use of adjectives cannot quite replicate.  He has concluded that his NDE demonstrates that consciousness does not arise in the brain, since his brain was \\"dead.\\"  He now seeks to invite other neurosurgeons (and readers like you and I) to conclude that what he experienced was Heaven.<br /><br />Perhaps he did.  There is little in this book to tell me he has sufficient religious foundation to offer such a far reaching conclusion. I did, however, begin to sense that there is, indeed, the likelihood of some type of mind activity even while dying.<br /><br />But it is only those who have had an NDE and write about it that tell us this. Too bad we can't get the viewpoint of someone who did actually die!!  Except Jesus!
B005QMOZOO|2.0|I was really looking forward reading this since I love Jane Austen and murder mysteries. I still haven't finished the book because it's so dull and nothing really happens. I don't know if I ever bother finishing the book.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|I have watched this show right from the start, and have absolutely loved every episode!  It just gets better and better and better!  I really hope that the first season is released on BluRay, and that there will be many, many more seasons!  There is no better reason to be sitting in front of the TV on a Wednesday night!  Can't wait for more!  :-)
B000BT97AO|5.0|This is honestly one of my favorite movies. The effects are very well done and the story is very original. Buy it! You won't regret it.
6305692572|5.0|Wonderful story, very enjoyable.<br />Of course the actors were perfect.<br />A subject that is often hidden and was addredded very well.
B000002MP3|5.0|The case was cracked but the product was verry good I listen to this @ school on my Walkman. Great item overall!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The Polar Express is a wonderful family movie!  My daughter & I love to watch it over and over!!  The story line is fantastic and keeps her interested.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Yup, good book w/ 12,000 additional words (as compared to the 1st published version). My lack of a 5th star arises from the labeling of this electronic edition as \\"[Kindle Edition with Audio/Video]\\".  The AV content is stuff like the author reading selected passages, an interview between the author & his editor, etc. Very nice. Or it would be nice except that it doesn't work on a Kindle (I am using it on the 1st generation Kindle Fire). To be fair, on the product page is some text saying<br />\\"Kindle Edition with Audio/Video<br />Audio/Video content only available for iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices.\\" but I think that if the AV doesn't work on a Kindle then you shouldn't be labeling as a Kindle edition with Audio/Video.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is the funnest cheapest addictivest awsomest game i have ever played. ever. i would buy another kindle  fire just to play this game. its that good
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This Masterpiece Classic is engaging and addicting if you love the United Kingdom and some of it's wonderful actors. Follows the lives of servants that serve Downton Abbey and obviously those that are priviledged enough to live or visit Downton Abbey. Lots of sidelines to this saga that mainly involve Lord Downton's three daughters. Can't wait for season 3 to come out on Blu-ray in January to see how the story continues.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using Evernote as a CRM tool to manage all my clients and I cannot imagine switching to something else. I use it for everything.
0425263908|5.0|I was weary about buying it because everyone said if you read Fifty Shades of Grey you read this one. Only the names changed. I didn't think is true. I loved it! Getting ready to read Reflected in You!
B00004Y635|5.0|This product was exactly as stated and the seller was terrific. Wonderful, fast and accurate. Very helpful and her correspondence was wonderful. Kept me up to date on everything. A+++ seller!!! The tape was in perfect shape and brand new still sealed. My son very very pleased.
0316066524|2.0|I purchased the book with high hopes. Not reading any reviews to spoil it, I just went about the book like a mad woman that I am trying to identify with the message. I skipped through the pages trying to find a hook. Something other than visual trickery to sustain my lack of focus and inattentiveness but then again when I think about it, maybe that was the whole point. Someone like me could never relate to someone like that.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Amazing writer and an incredible main character!  Kvothe is by far the most interesting and compelling main character in a fantasy novel since Bilbo or Frodo!<br />READ THIS BOOK!<br /><br />Ps.  Hurry up and finish the next book!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very witty bookthat embraces the sheer determination of the human being to survive. The character is great in his \\"up yours\\" to what Mars and possible death has in store for him. Brilliantly written.
B000W178XO|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD but wished it held even more of his great songs. There are more \\"best of\\" Johnny Cash CD that I will have to purchase. I think throughout his career and life, Johnny Cash's songs and his voice convey deep feeling and strenth. His voice isn't pretty, but it's great to hear. I feel actually uplifted listening to his music, even with a sadder song, I come away with a good feeling.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game and doesn't require a lot of instruction to move forward.  Good brain exercise!  If you like Tetris, you will like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Coming from someone new to reading 5 stars I think is good. This book simply got me hooked and I finished it in two days. I could really get into the imagery and feel apart. If you have watched the movie... and liked it, you will love the book. It has so much detail and even a few more scenes. I would recommend this to anyone
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Being a fan any Michael Jackson memorabilia I purchase is simply appreciated. I thought the picture and sound quality was good and it looked great on my big scren
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was my first Reacher book. It was a fun read! I would have liked to know more about the character. I bought book two, maybe I will learn more about the character in this installment.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Was an exciting movie to watch, was not expecting the ending.. :)<br />Was a very good thrilling movie to watch,,, i watched it a couple times and enjoyed it alot
B009FZHYKU|5.0|awersome that they continue to portray this content with such reality!!! so I am finally feeling like someplace someone got the message about viewers intellect....
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not much suspense. Nothing thrilling. But, kept your interest.  I thought there would be more action and tension. Not a bad read but more lawyer stuff.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great pocket sharpener.  Perfect for storing in a back pack or hunting stow.  It's nice to have the ability to put a clean edge on your knife, even in the field.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|not as good as bbc, but worth the watch.  I am not a fan of a woman Watson.  Not as true to the original as some remakes.
B008XG1X18|4.0|locks up sometimes but other than that it works good. I enjoy using this app and would recommend it to my friends.
1582701709|1.0|I'll give you my copy for free to stop the peddling of the farce. It's just a waste of time book about feel good get good feel bad get bad which is a load of you know what. There have been instances of people getting better from illnesses and that they used the power of positive thought or prayer and that is being looked into but this book exploits your curiosity and then spins lies. Did you know if your sick you brought it upon yourself with negative thinking?? That the rich people in this world aren't rich through fame, family fortune, a lotto winner or even hard work, they are rich because of this secret! What a line of bs for fools to follow. The TRUTH is,  if the same things happened to two different people in a ten year span with one being a positive person and the other negative person it would still be the same result. The only differences would be in their outlook on the matters nothing more. This book suggest wishful thinking will get you by and that isn't scientifically sound. I suggest the author jump off the highest building in the world with one thought in her mind and that is the wind will blow me in a window and save me. The results of this test will speak volumes of her theory and rid us of a flake.<br />Peace!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|It was just okay. The acting was mediocre and the plot was weak. Only the ending brought it from 2 to 3 stars.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|No longer will run on my DROID at all. Locks it up every time! Stop adding &quot;features&quot; and just make it work. Uninstalling.
B008BR3Q0U|5.0|'Big Moon Ritual' and 'The Magic Door' have been the soundtracks to my summer.  I think I'm digging \\"The Magic Door' a little more, although 'Big Moon' is probably the more polished of the 2.  There's just something special about the whole vibe of this record.  You can practically smell the Patchouli oil and insence when you lay the needle in the groove.  I had the great pleasure of seeing CRB live this past weekend.  They played most of the songs on these excellent 2 albums.  It's no surprise, CRB are a great live band, and 'The Magic Door\\" really captures that live feel.<br /><br />\\"Someday Past the Sunset\\" is one of best Robinson tunes EVER.  Lyrically and stylistically it has a Dylanesque feel to me.  It's one of the heaviest songs on the 2 albums.  Neals Casal' killer slide is in full effect here.  This is hippie-jam music for the new millenium.  Likewise is the epic 'Vibration & Light\\", with it's catchy chorus and jazzy feel.  I love the way it dissolves into a Floydian sound collage at the end.  Another highlight is the super mellow reading of a recent Black Crowes song, 'Appaloosa'.  It's one of the most beautiful moments on the record.  This record is pure enjoyment from beginning to end.<br /><br />The vinyl is worth getting for the Artwork alone, but the discs sound awesome too.  One platter is pressed on white vinyl, the other on black, and they are 45 RPM.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I've been hoping Amazon might offer this as their free app and today they have.  I've had the free version of this app for some time.<br />It's a good chess game app, without useless fluff.  Also, the permissions are very few, just one and so you can feel very secure using/installing it.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|Great all-around player. Easy to use, feature rich and updated regularly. Author provides specific codecs for various platform. The only media player I now use.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|All I can say is, so far, so good.  It does everything advertised.  If it quits working, I will be returning it to the manufacturer.  Followup...  I have used this for about 2 years, and it has worked perfectly.
1905236042|5.0|Yoga Pretzels are great cards to get so that you can makeup your own routine.  Some of the moves I will never do in my lifetime but that is ok.  They are labeled so that you know what is a warm up versus something to do after you warm up.  I highly recommend them!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not as good as some of his others but I did enjoy it.  Was slow in some sections but kept you guessing until the end.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|The movie was one you could relax and enjoy.  It had a lot of comedy in it.  This would be a good movie for girls night out. The movie was about right it wasn't to long.  There are parts of the movie men would like, it would be a good movie to take your wife out too,  I enjoyed watching this movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|awesome. its the perfect game for anyone! :D I loved it<br />at least.but why does it have to be 2.99? :(
B007J4T2G8|4.0|These books are a good read and I enjoyed this one and the following two.  If you are looking for a literary clasic, this is not the book for you.  If you are looking for a page turner that is interestiong and provides a window into a character  craziness then enjoy!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|My husband had recommended this book to me and I have to confess I had a hard time getting it out of his hand he read and reread it.  Found the principles in this book so profound and I'm implementing them in my life.  Sent a copy to my son as well and he's been blown away by it at well.  This book is more than a book about business, but a book about truth that if you begin to make changes in your life you won't see the changes right away, but if you will continue you will see changes over time.  So often we give up in the middle.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found the book to be a page-turner though at times the writing seemed very elementary and redundant. The twists and turns keep you wanting to know more about the elusive Dominant and his not so willing submissive. A fun fast fantasy read though many girls hope for someone like Mr. Grey without the kinky baggage. Still I couldn't put it down.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this CD. My roommate and I have listened to it over and over and every time we are amazed by the songs on this CD. The songs are soothing yet fun to listen to. Each time I listen to the CD, it makes me want to play either the piano or the cello. There really aren't enough words to describe how amazing this CD is. Definitely buy it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. My father died of cancer three years ago. I know Hazel's story isn't the same but still, it resonated in me. Plus, I have a 13-year-old daughter... she is healthy but any parent can imagine. Thank you Mr. Green for sharing this piece of infinity with us, but what happened to Hazel's mom and dad, or Gus' mom and dad or Anna's mom or the Dutch man? ... :-)
B000E41MRC|3.0|i was both fascinated and horrified by this film. Fascinated by the film work. Horrified at the evil that was generated by Adolph Hitler.<br /><br />I rated this film as neutral as I can't say that I liked it or loved it given the content.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can play for hours. very entertaining games. my kids also love it. would love to have more games added.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Let's put this out there right up front. I am not a fan of Arnold. Especially since his recent escapade. However after reading this book you have to have a lot of respect for what he has accomplished. This is not a lazy or stupid man. He has done so much in his life and it seems as if he has earned it on his own. He clearly has a huge ego which stems from strong self confidence and his many successes. I found the book to be very enjoyable. There is so much detail re: his life in the book it is sometimes a bit much but he doesn't short change you. I recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham at his best. An interesting and different storyline. It was hard to put down as the climax btgan to take shape.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|I'm writing this review one day before the premiere of the Skyfall (25th October 2012), so I can't be influenced by the film. Just small detail about me - I own all 007 soundtracks on CDs, Casino Royal (1967) and Never Say Never Again: Original Soundtrack [SOUNDTRACK] (1983) included.<br /><br />Since 1997 (Tomorrow Never Dies: Original Soundtrack [SOUNDTRACK]) - there has not been the change on the composer's position. David Arnold did with his strong signature amazing work (five scores). It was Sam Mendes wish to bring his partner in crime into 007 film.<br /><br />So, how does it look now with a new captain? Well, Thomas Newman is a very well known composer but in a completely different waters. His music is more minimalistic (American Beauty), slower (Shawshank Redemption), deep (Road to Perdition) with a lot of melodies (sometimes reminds me the late John Barry sound). Obviously, here he needed to change his style. An action film needs an action soundtrack (Drive - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack- is a very nice exception).<br /><br />Let's start. The first song the first second (Grand Bazaar, Istanbul) - it is the From Russia With Love sound and in Istanbul as well! Very nice! It can't be a coincidence :-) Then we continue with a few mid tempo songs, a little bit of love (Severine), action (Brave New World, Jellyfish, Silhouette) and deep sound songs (Day Wasted, Quartermaster) and the ambient song (Skyfall) is amazing! I'm not going to write about all of them but generally this is a good score (and my first looong review on Amazon, so I am little bit nervous).<br /><br />Sometimes we can hear little bit of Thomas Newman, sometimes John Barry style together with samples and techy sounds (Turkey, Brave New World, Shanghai Drive, Komodo Dragon). Still it is a very traditional soundtrack not like The World Is Not Enough with lots of drum and bass beats. Samples are used very gently.<br /><br />While I listened Skyfall I needed to listen again The Shawshank Redemption, Road To Perdition and The American Beauty soundtracks and I have to say those three are like siblings of one family but Skyfall is a completely different child. We can hear fast tempo songs, slow, loud, quiet - typical for action films. I'm not sure if the Thomas Newman fans will be happy with it but 007 fans might be.<br /><br />Skyfall remindes me the change with Michael Kamen - License To Kill. After years with John Barry and his strong signature came normal score. It is more about doing \\"normal job\\" than bringing something really new (David Arnold) but Licence To Kill can live without the pictures but Skyfall can't. Another change - Eric Serra - GoldenEye - (which I really like) sometimes fights with the pictures but as only the music works perfectly.<br /><br />I hope EON would think next time more about the composer. Try to listen to 1 min of some song from David Arnold 007 work and you would know who is he working for. You can recognize THE sound. Skyfall reminds you nothing. It is like a food without the taste. You feel filled up but you know you don't want to eat again. On the other hand the new Jason Bourne soundtrack (James Newton Howard - The Bourne Legacy) is even wors! It is so forgettable! Can't believe what have happend to the composers in these days....<br /><br />The CD is full of music - 30 songs total 77 min. Like Casino Royale, the title song is not included. For me it is better because when you buy the single you will get the instrumental version as well. I really enjoyed Quantum Of Solace - Another Way To Die - instrumental.<br /><br />Finally, Skyfall is a another change into 007 world but for the next 007 film I wish to hear David Arnold.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />If you are missing the David Arnold sound try to have a look at his<br />The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader soundtrack - it is a worth a buy (now on Amazon for £3 !)mption, Road To Perdition and The American Beauty soundtracks and I have to say those three are like siblings of one family but Skyfall is a completely different child.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Entertaining.  Kept you interested.  Author could have delved more into the history of Grey a bit more and should have used a thesaurus on some words, but still worth reading for a mature audience.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|a great story that leaves you with a better understanding of  life in the foster system and how one can conquer the poor hand that was delt.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|game is great kids love it I like it don't need to spend money on it to go far in it
B004PGAQMW|4.0|This movie was very good. I liked the story and the characters were excellent. It can't get 5 stars as it didn't totally blow me away as did the movie The Incredibles.
0545123267|4.0|When I first started reading this it reminded me so much of Twilight with those stupid wolves. But then I realized how much better it was then Twilight, that the wolves are actual wolves, and I've always loved wolves.<br /><br />It's believable so far, Grace isn't a perfect Mary Sue like I thought she would be. She's in introvert, loves books and her wolf. Reminds me of myself actually, which is wonderful because I can actually connect with the character.<br /><br />High school drama, fighting friends, all totally believable.  The only thing thats squicked me out so far is that Grace is in love with a wolf, which screams bestiality, which is mega creepy. Luckily for her her wolf turns out to also be a boy.<br /><br />Who happened to get shot, and transformed naked on her porch. Grace said she didn't stare, but if I just found my love interest naked on the floor, bleeding or not, I'd take a moment to stare.<br /><br />I like that the book is split into Grace's and Sam's perspective. I enjoy Sam's POV much more then Graces. He has a much more interesting take on the world, because he spends most of it as a wolf.<br /><br />The rules on changing seem to be pretty straightforward, if you get bit by a wolf, you become one. Although for some reason Grace hasn't, although she does have a 'wolf sense' or something, that if she focuses gives her heightened senses of smell and hearing. You become human in the spring months, and turn back into a wolf at the winter months, which seems pretty interesting to me. Although I think I'd rather be a wolf in the spring months, and human during the winter so at least I won't freeze or starve to death as a wolf. You also get a limited number of changes, I'm wondering if you get to chose to become human or wolf at the end. Although Sam said that this time would be his last time changing or something.<br /><br />The chasity fact also annoys me. It's clear they Sam wants to be with Grace, but he's really hesitant about putting any moves on her. It seems like he doesn't even want to kiss her, yet he's seen her naked. And they sleep in the same bed! You can't tell me he doesn't wake up in the mornings aroused. Do something already!! Or at least talk about it or something, especially since they are clearly madly in love with each other.<br /><br />I find it hard to classify the wolves as werewolves, to me those creatures are something like out of Harry Potter, a bit grotesque and very scary, not actual wolves. To me  Sam and his group are move like shape shifters, or lycans or just plain people that change into wolves, or wolves that change into people since they will eventually become wolves forever.<br /><br />The ending was so frustrating! It just ends, they see each other again, and thats it no feelings from either character on what its like to see the other.<br /><br />I'm going to read the next book because I liked the first one. Although Grace annoyed me more as the book went on. Sam did a bit too, although I really liked the character, the fact that he was so chaste, and felt that their love making was a mistake or something was just off. It made no sense, especially since he loved Grace so much, and wanted to be with her. He didn't react like a guy was supposed to, he was far to chaste for today's men. Which while isn't necessarily a bad thing, it would have been nice to have Sam display his want for Grace a bit more.her. It seems like he doesn't even want to kiss her, yet he's seen her naked.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds and Star Wars, and when you put them together it's bound to be awesome. And it is.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|It was a good story but didn't really grab my attention. Reading was slow because the plot didn't hold my interest.  It was defintely not one of those books you don't want to put down until you are finished.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games that keep me entertained for hours!!<br />get this app you wont regret it!!! and this review needs 13 lines for me to submit so here ya go!! :D
B005HSL626|5.0|I could play this game for a very long time, and a matter of fact i have! Its cut into my usual chores sometimes! My child enjoys it also, thank goodness, because i originally bought it for her!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Contrary to the title, this is a great movie. Some dance moves are a bit much, but for the most part the dancing is great and the story is a classic - girl meets boy, girl falls for boy, but will they end up together in the end?<br /><br />Some of the plot is a bit deep and parents should abide by the PG-13 rating or maybe even a bit older. I have loved this movie since it came out and have watched it enough times I can almost say the whole movie word for word.<br /><br />Expect to watch this one again and again!
B007THA4FI|1.0|very disappointed with the book. confusing, story was so childlike. the cursing was too much,the subject matter was confusing. maybe it was too u.k. english for me.
B003B02PFO|5.0|It goes without saying that John Grisham is a superb author.  In reading Skipping Christmas, the author has really hit the nail on the head as some of us have had the thoughts of why go through all this agony of getting ready for Christmas.  This would be an excellent book to give as a Christmas gift.  It may help us to see that a simpler way to enjoy family and friends is the answer and to remember the real reason for Christmas.
1432794426|5.0|As the author of \\"Spiritual Impressions-A Personal Tribute To Michael Jackson\\", I congratulate Karen Moiarty for this very caring book about Michael.<br />Sadly, there are many negative books about Michael Jackson available. Karen is trying to re-create Michael´s wonderful personality which has been over-shadowed of harsh comments by the media.<br />I highly recommend her book as I want the world to know the truth about Michael Jackson.
B007N0AEWY|5.0|After hearing the single, I couldn't wait to purchase the full album - it's even better than I'd expected. Soulful vintage R&B from another time, it never ceases to bring a smile to my face when I listen to it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I can't say its the best Grisham book.. but it comes very close. Very very good. To be honest I find it hard to say any grisham book is better than any other, and this one is no exception. Excellent work as usual!
B004KKX814|5.0|Son researched and spent his own money on it.  Was thrilled when it arrived!!  It has held up very well and was worth the money to my son
0140282033|4.0|I picked this book up about a week ago.  I actually thought I'd read it before but I saw the movie version, which I discovered is a lot different from the book.  In the movie some of the characters are the same but with different titles.  Francis Reynaud is a comte in the movie but a cure, or priest in the book and so it goes.  The story is of a woman and her daughter who come to a small French village and open a Chocolaterie.  Just like the movie, the recreation of scents, shapes, tastes, and almost true sensuality of chocolate hits the reader.  It makes one want to get up and make a cup of hot chocolate or go and munch on some good dark chocolate laced with lavender and blueberries.  Joanne Harris has done a good job in trying to portray this feeling.  Vianne, the shop owner, has the ability to know what people like and also has an inner sense of their conflicts.  She makes an effort to know them, and also sparks some resentment among some of them mainly the cure, Francis Reynaud who is appalled that she has opened this shop during Lent and remains open on Sundays providing temptation to parishioners who are supposed to be denying themselves culinary pleasures at this time.  Vianne makes friends of everyone that comes into her shop even the river folk, or gypsies, that many in the village hold with disdain.  She feels a bond with them because as a child she and her mother roamed from place to place in search of their destiny and move everytime they feel the wind whispering to them.  Has Vianne found a home here or will she move on?
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I really love the whole movie and all the twists it has, there's also a few things that I was not expecting. The animation is well made and voice acting was superb. Batman is super dark in this one and I really love it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The cast of characters in this movie was absolutely stellar. Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith are just a few that I remember.  The story involves a group of retirees who are enticed to go and live in India at a run down hotel managed by a young man who is trying desperately to make a go of this business.  He also has his own concerns that include a domineering mother who doesn't feel he can succeed and a girlfriend that his mother won't accept.  The people at the hotel all have their own stories of course, and they are sometimes funny and at the same time sad.  There is the couple who have lost most of their investments and forced to live in an environment that the wife finds less than desirable.  Never mind that she won't even leave the hotel to explore all the nearby sites and absorb the culture.  As one of the characters put it, \\"this is a country where life is a privilege not a right.\\"  There is so much to see and experience. Someone finds a job, another has hip surgery.  One man seeks a long lost love.  Two of the others try to find a way to end their lonliness.  Of course, all these people are brought together and make a difference in each other's lives.  Sometimes it doesn't work out but it becomes a learning process.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Even though I seemed a little behind everyone else in getting to this book, it is one of the best I've read this year! Off to download the second........
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This is a great product!  At first I wondered about the strap on front, but found it to be the perfect<br />place for holding ear buds and stylus.
0385535147|1.0|Extremely Bad! I bought this book after reading a preview on Kindle. About two thirds of the way through the plot became so ridiculous I scanned to the end just to be done with it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Riveting. Difficult to put down. Obviously an excellent storyteller. Need to review which of his other books I have not read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This thing has just come out and the first thing I do when I wake up is download it. It's awesome. So well done, so beautifully crafted, and a joy to play. Not too easy that you just fly through the levels (no pun intended) with three stars all the time, but not too difficult (hello, Seasons?) that you get stuck in places. Of course I'm gonna be able to get work done, but this thing is going to make it just a little more difficult!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am running it on the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch model.  It works great and is highly addictive.  Highly recommended.
1451695195|5.0|This NDE account is an excellent read and is very thought provoking. If you are at all curious about what might come after... read this. It will change your life.
B002JI94J4|1.0|I have had this item shipped to me TWICE, and both times it was the DVD, NOT Blu-ray. Hope you have better luck, but don't say you weren't warned!
159420411X|5.0|Is there anything that anyone can say beyond the election ? Not really, but  congratulations to Nate Silver for nailing the November elections, proving that,despite the disingenuous denial of the right and the multi-million they spent to buy the election, math wins! Some people have not evolved to the point of realizing that arithmetic is an exact science.
B005COO1X6|2.0|This was the first of King's works I've ever read. I'm hoping it's not representative of most of his work. I don't want to write any kind of spoiler so without going into too much detail, I found it uninteresting and predictable.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I have only played one game so far, so I can't comment on how strong the chess engine is but it played well enough for me. The graphics and UI are very good with plenty of options. Other reviews have mentioned the only features that I see missing. Scenarios and board coordinates. I want to comment on a couple other reviews. There is a handicapping option that will make one side start with a piece missing. That could be why one reviewer is missing a knight. There is also a move called en passant which allows a pawn to capture another pawn that has passed in certain circumstances. That might explain a &quot;bug&quot; that someone mentioned. Overall a great game and I am going to check out some of the dev's other games.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This was an extremely well written and well produced movie. It has a great flow from scene to scene, all centered around the same group of SEALs.  Using actual SEALs as the actors was a brilliant move.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Absorbing story, great thoughts - a book you can't stop reading. One of the best books I have read recently.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|I forced myself to read the third book in case I was missing something (so many people raving about the series and I had yet to experience what they had).  I shouldn't have bothered!  So many books and so little time and it appears I wasted mine.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Well written, well drawn characters, and engaging plot. Toward the end I had a lot of trouble putting it down! Highly recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is crazy addicting. Super fun. Really enjoy it, got my sister to start playing.  I recommend Coin dozer
B0098460O4|5.0|This album is magnificent.  Every single piece is amazing.  You will enjoy it even if you aren't the biggest opera fan in the world.  And with all due respect to the great Pavarotti, Jonathan Antoine's voice is richer and more beautiful.  I love it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Awesome coming of age story.. story moving from start till the last page. Chosen format of written letters - which normally does not work for me - to an (imaginary) friend brings an unique and even more personal angle that the traditional I form.
B00136JS12|5.0|I got the hole album for free.  It cost $5 (at that time) to buy, but I had a $5 coupon.  Free = 5 stars, and the album was not bad.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Even more amazing than original Quell!  Definitely refreshes your concentration skills!  I would recommend this to ANYONE! Now let me get back to my game!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is amazing. I enjoy playing.My children steal it from me all the time. I tell all my friends about it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|almost one of stephen king's best.  He just gets better and better. I can't keep up.  The first one that made me cry more then once.  In fact almost all the way through.  I loved it.  It is a MUST read, especially if you were there at the time.  I was and I remember.  It all came flooding back, and by the way, I'm a Canadian close to the border.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Good Evening, All...<br /><br />Arrived today:<br />Solti/Wagner, RING (deluxe edition) #768 of 7000 copies....<br /><br />One of the absolute most-beautiful boxed sets that I have ever seen on CDs. Very much reminds me of the old original LP Deluxe Ring set w/Culshaw's book. Beautiful white slipcase imprinted in black over the black and copper foil slipcase inside that holds the 4 internal \\"books\\" that contain:<br />1) a new edition of Culshaw's \\"Ring Resounding\\", re-published unaltered but with a new foreward.<br />2) a very well laid out home for the recordings themselves, each opera held on its own page, plus Deryck Cooke's famous \\"Introduction\\" on CDs and also \\"in print\\" (see 3 below), a 17th CD containing the overtures recordings, the Siegfried idyll, and Kinderkatechismus recording that Solti recorded also with the Vienna Phil. during the years of recording The Ring. The 18th disc in this \\"book\\" may very well be the kicker for lovers of this Ring Cycle: the Entire Ring, complete on 1 Blu-Ray disc in loss-less HD sound!<br />3) \\"The Guides\\" contains the hard copy content of Cooke's \\"Introduction, etc.\\", the text(s) where appropriate for the CD #17 mentioned above, the DVD edition of \\"The Golden Ring\\", the documentary filmed during the recording of \\"Gotterdammerung\\" in 1964, reproductions of Solti's personal score(s) used during the recording sessions, showing his details and markings in red pencil, etc. Also housed here are large spectacular photos of the harpists, Solti conducting, Solti & Culshaw during a discussion, an aerial photo inside the Sofiensaal during recording (God, what a beautiful building this was!), and a dramatic photograph of Birgit Nilsson during recording. Also a 36 page booklet of publicity materials used by Decca to promote the original recordings and all the reviews to appear in Gramophone as the recordings were released, etc.<br />4) Contains the complete libretti for the four operas, generously laid out on pages containing plenty of white space, which greatly aids one in following along should you wish to do so.<br /><br />Expensive? Yes. However, produced in a limited edition of only 7,000 copies. It is luxurious, magnificently designed and presented, and for lovers of this grand set of recordings, surely a pleasure to have, to hold, and above all to listen to both in the conventionally remastered 24bit CDs and on the Blu-Ray edition in HD sound.<br /><br />I thought about it for some time and then I finally sprung for it. I am VERY glad that I did so...it is truly the Fitting Tribute that it was intended to be for Wagner's 200th Birthday and for Solti's 100th!<br /><br />The improvement in sound on these discs is mind-boggling to me. It is SO amazing that these 50-year-old recordings can sound so amazingly crisp, clear, and fresh to these old ears that have come to know them in all of their previous releases over the years! The adjustments and sound balance, especially dimensionality of singers within the sound field almost makes one think these are new, previously never heard, recordings! KUDOS, Decca, both for your original foresight and for this amazingly improved new remastering! Also, as I said above, thanks for this most beautiful re-presentation celebrating Wagner's and Sir Georg Solti's special one and two hundredth birthdays.<br /><br />Don't delay if you want a copy of this magnificent special edition box!hite space, which greatly aids one in following along should you wish to do so.<br /><br />Expensive? Yes. However, produced in a limited edition of only 7,000 copies. It is luxurious, magnificently designed and presented, and for lovers of this grand set of recordings, surely a pleasure to have, to hold, and above all to listen to both in the conventionally remastered 24bit CDs and on the Blu-Ray edition in HD sound.<br /><br />I thought about it for some time and then I finally sprung for it.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Perhaps 50 Shades Darker is a continuation of a new type of romantic literature which was started with the first book in the Trilogy.  It has fewer characters, less descriptions of the setting, and a strong story line.  I found it interesting and a quick read.  At first I thought it was mainly for older women who had been away from a sexual relationship for several years and could suspend reality.  But then I met a younger woman who had not been in a serious relationship and she too found it a good read.  So my review would be to try it and see if you like it.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I've had the free version for years and love it.  Great to see the paid version as a free app of the day.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|When the case came I was really happy with the color and design, but after about a day or so I got to thinking about the description of the case and it said that it is supposed  to put it in sleep mode when you close the case and turn it on when you open it. Am I misunderstanding what the description meant or did I just get a defective case? If it weren't for thus issue, then I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars, but for this reason I had to give it 4. So maybe someone has an answer or suggestion about this problem. Hope this review is helpful.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I'm not very good at writing reviews and it's going to show.  All that I can really say about this movie is that it completely blew my expectations away.  I already had high hopes for it with it being a Batman movie but I originally had no intention of watching this one. I had seen a number of other DCU movies and I thought they were pretty good. I didn't think this would be on par with them... but you know what, Under the Red Hood proved to be a way better movie than Apocalypse, Public Enemies, Doom, Wonder Woman. And I like the latter two quite a bit.  But the list goes on.<br /><br />Under the Red Hood was not only dark but it was deeply emotional.  Not the kind of emotion that you have to try to feel - that manufactured emotion - but the kind that just kicks in on its own.  I almost cried at the end, honest to god.  There isn't a person out there that wouldn't feel a thing while watching this movie.  Watch it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed the storyline and characters.  Can‘t wait to read more about them & the other silos.  I  hope Jules is a major character that sticks around.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The plot was great, but the writing a little helter skelter.  I think the ending was a huge disappointment.  Like one reviewer said, \\"it was like the author stopped writing.\\"  Maybe that was the intent, in order to leave an opening for Gone Girl II.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved this movie! My husband who has not read the book nor was very interested in watching the movie also LOVED IT!!
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Most enjoyable and very relevant to current intergenerational social problems.<br />Anxiety and inner turmoil of mother explored, as she deals with husband's reluctance to upset the household,<br />and children's shock and resistance to change.<br />Great development of theme and pleasant humourous outcome.<br />Good read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great historical read. Follett does an excellent job carrying on from the first book in the trilogy, as well as incorporating well-known and lesser-known historical details.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|love the app I setup home camera DVR system on it now I can see my house anywhere from my phone and kindle fire easy to setup love it
B004SEUJVO|4.0|The couple who run the park are young and are trying to make a buck the only way they know how. They rig the games so that there is hardly ever a winner. Characters were believable.  Just a good movie with Kristen Stewart in it.  She gives it a little life along with Ryan Reynolds and Jesse Eisenberg.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and as a fan of Kate Morton, was not let down on this one!<br />I love her writing style and always look forward to reading her new releases !
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Have played this album several times.  Love all the songs on it.  Taylor has a great voice.  Songs are original.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I've long been a John Grisham fan. His series of Thomas Boone has come a long way. I gave my copies of his other works to a local middle school where I used to substitute teach and I have found the kids there enjoy the series.
B009329ZF2|5.0|My 12 year old grandson talked me into buying this.  To my surprise I was hooked from the start.  The entire family enjoyed it.  Sci-Fi, action, plus a love story.  It is a bit loud at times, but well worth it.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|This is one more book I've enjoyed of Stephen King. Since I have learned to read and appreciate his work I look forward to another book of his. His writings tend to challenge me to think and guess what's next and then I find I wasn't completely correct.
B000TVNW50|5.0|I enjoy a love story and anything to do with King Arthur.  This movie delighted my heart.  If you like it when good triumphs, you will enjoy it too.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book may have been a little tough to keep up with at first (in terms of names and terminology ) however it was an extremely satisfying read. I look forward to the rest.
B0082SU98U|5.0|My Mom read me this story years ago.  The girl is so sweet and accepting of others.  It's a refresher course on how to look at the positive in situations and in people, to be happy.  Try reading this book and you will feel good.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Book two continues to keep me engaged. Quick, entertaining read that pulls me out of the current world and into the crazy world of The Games!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot wait to read the 2nd book. I have hope that Christian and Anastasia will get back together. Live happily ever after and she will be able to touch him forever.
B009JNXK88|5.0|Love this game.  First platformer I can actually play!  The controls are easy and simple and there's a ton of game to get through.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I completely love this game, but be aware it is very addictive. Once you start it is so hard to stop.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It's a Jack Reacher story by Lee Child. What else needs to be said? It's a wild ride full of tension, humor, scary government secrets, good guys who look like bad guys, the baddest of bad guys, Reacher in impossible situations that he can't possibly get out of but of course does. I'll never drive I-80 through Iowa again without looking for him.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|I was disappointed in the end.  The cast and acting was very good.  The film looked wonderful.  The buildup of music for suspense and thrills was cheesy and over-the-top.  The story line was lame and in the end forgotten altogether.  It is clean and I do wish there were more clean thrillers out.  We need another good \\"Poltergeist\\", but alas...
B0063GORYU|3.0|Good version of Spider but there are too many pop up ads.  How about one per session.  Particularly irritating is the verizon ad which covers the entire screen.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It is not a fancy case at all. But it is useful enough, does what a case should do - protect the Kindle - if that is all you need.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I use the Kindle Fire in bed and this cover works well for me.  It holds the Fire in place and makes it easy for me to view videos.
B009C5Z112|5.0|The wait was long, but the result is one of the most amazing metal albums I have ever heard. Definitely a masterpiece! I am anxious to hear Time II already!
B00886XQO0|3.0|I purchased this because my old logitech F540 broke.  I wanted a headset that had 5.1 surround with good sound quality.  This delivers ok, however, they are not worth the $299 price tag.  I would say these are at best, a $175 headset.  The sound quality is good.  Audio goes plenty loud.  Surround sound is nice.  Ease of setup, not bad.  Way too many audio presets, and if you select anything other than the main preset, you lose dolby digital surround...so what good are they?
B009NQKPUW|2.0|If the standard explanation for how life began on earth bores you, there's always this version where it all started with a naked, puking albino. Sorry, \\"Prometheus\\" didn't do it for me. Yeah, I know we might be a little sick of our old drooling friend with the acid blood, but at least he didn't talk, which is more than I can say for everyone in this movie. In fact, they yak all the way through it. The visuals seem like a fusion of \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Stargate,\\" but there's none of that shadowy, dark, damp atmosphere that added to the impact of the \\"Alien\\" series. Noomi Rapace is no Sigourney Weaver, and Charlize Theron is totally wasted as a space vamp. The best character is David, the android and one wonders why androids couldn't have been in charge of the whole thing from the beginning. At least they don't talk much.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game!<br />It is so much fun! and challenging. You don't get bored with it! and works well on my kindle fire!
B00866H7SS|5.0|this is a must read will leave you wanting more, if you a fan of 50 shades of grey then you will love this, you get more of an inside to each person in the book more then what you did in the 1st book of 50 shades, i read this book in a day couldn't put it down then picked up book 2 straight away!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Does what it needs to do. No complaints about it. I can access multiple accounts. It's perfect! Works well on my kindle too
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling's tale started \\"fast\\" but then slowed \\"dramatically\\" as it became muddled with the various threads that I found difficult to tie to the opening.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Some people may consider Lee's writing simplistic. Sure the character, Jack Reacher, may have become clichéd however the intriguing plots and short sharp writing style keep me hooked. Lee doesn't waste time describing the \\"dappling shadows of the oak tree as it swayed in the breeze like a blah blah blah\\", you get the picture. Lee writes direct to the story line and doesn't waste words.<br /><br />He leads you along at a good pace and maintains your curiosity to a level that makes it hard to put the books down at night. \\"Just one more chapter\\" is my catch cry each evening. I guess if I had one criticism on this one it was the ending. It was a bit of an anti climax for me and I was left wanting to know more. Perhaps it will be followed up down the track in another book.<br /><br />Overall I like the series but I guess it may be an acquired taste.
0385738765|3.0|i  recently picked up The Maze Runner and though it wasn&iexcl;¯t my favourite in the dystopian genre, I enjoyed it enough to want to read more. The Scorch Trials picks up right where The Maze Runner left off, with Thomas and the remaining Gladers at a safe-haven of sorts, a mere day after their daring escape from the maze. There&iexcl;¯s a lot going on in this book with plot twists and turns filling every chapter. Dasher threw so much out there that I was reeling by the end. If I thought the first book was a doozy, I was wrong. There were too many questions in this one and not enough answers and it just left me confused. Dashner was trying so hard to amp up the sequel that he got lost in all the action. There was little in the way of depth or character development which is what I really wanted to see.<br /><br />What I did like about The Scorch Trials is that we&iexcl;¯re actually shown what happened to the outside world and many of the people in it. We get up close and personal with a few of the Cranks and learn that they&iexcl;¯re not all bad. I actually felt sorry for them because of the terrible things they were forced to go through. I liked hearing that part of the story. In fact, we&iexcl;¯re introduced to several new groups of people, including another set of kids affected by WICKED&iexcl;¯s trials. But it eventually becomes hard to distinguish who is who or even care about them because we don&iexcl;¯t get much of their backstory. It&iexcl;¯s too much&iexcl;ªtoo much action and too many people to keep it all straight. Also, much of The Scorch Trials is told with Thomas being separated from rest of the Gladers. These are the peeps I grew to know and love and I was invested in them from the beginning. I cared more about their fates than the fates of the new additions. Give me more Gladers! Dashner also decided to throw my beloved Minho through the ringer in this book. Not cool man, not cool.<br /><br />Another thing I could&iexcl;¯ve done without was the love-triangle between Thomas, Teresa and Brenda. It felt out of place and too forced for a novel like this. The Maze Runner was a decent debut for Dashner. It had so much potential and unfortunately for me, The Scorch Trials just didn&iexcl;¯t measure up&iexcl;ªlike many sequels, it fell flat. I wanted more background information on WICKED and what their big plan was for the world, but Dashner just kept raising more issues and provided no resolution to any of them. Sometimes I wondered if he even knew where he was going with it all. Despite my misgivings with this book though, I figure I&iexcl;¯ve invested enough time and energy to come back for the final chapter. Dashner did keep me intrigued enough to want to know who is behind WICKED and why they&iexcl;¯re basically torturing these poor kids. I need to know&iexcl;ªcan the Gladers achieve their destiny and save the world or will they meet their end? I suppose I&iexcl;¯ll just have to keep on reading!<br /><br />Food for Thought: Overall, I have to say I liked The Scorch Trials less than its predecessor. Though there was an abundance of action, the book can get confusing with all the questions raised and the new character additions. It&iexcl;¯s difficult to tell exactly how Dashner plans to reconcile all of WICKED&iexcl;¯s plans but I am intrigued enough to stick around and find out.<br /><br />Rating: &iexcl;ï&iexcl;ï&iexcl;ïda.

B000002OZY|5.0|I probably won't say anything countless other people have said about this album by The Who. I have it on vinyl and it still blows me away. The band are totally in synch, the composition is amazing, the arrangements are so inventive and creative, and the lyrics to some of the songs were ahead of their time and controversial. I would put this album in a Top 50 of best albums of the 60's/70s. That's saying something.<br /><br />Recommended to any Who fan or anyone else that enjoys fantastic/innovative rock music.
0156027321|4.0|When you hear about \\"Life of Pi,\\" you think: how can anyone write a whole book or film a whole movie about a boy trapped on a boat with a tiger?  Sure, Hitchcock did it with his classic film [[ASIN:B000A9QK7I Lifeboat]].  But with that, there were give-and-take conversations between a few people.  Here, we're talking about a boy and...a tiger.  Nobody else.  That's when you insert a narrator (Pi) who seems to have ADD and tends to ramble.  A lot.  That's how you fill up 300 pages.<br /><br />With that said, Pi's (short for Piscine, which is pronounced like p i s s i n g, for which he's teased by other kids) time onboard the boat only takes place for about a third of the novel.  Before that, Pi is living in India with his family, taking care of the animals at a zoo.<br /><br />Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone with severe ADD?  That's what reading this book felt like.  I thought it should have rather been titled \\"How I Rambled for 300 Pages.\\"  For all those pages, I felt like the author rambled on and on and on about nothing and was going nowhere.  I was prepared to give the author 2 stars for this nonsense.<br /><br />For me, there's always that first sentence or first paragraph or first chapter that immediately draws me into a book.  Unfortunately, upon my first reading, \\"Life of Pi\\" didn't have any of those for me.  However, when I read the final couple of chapters, that's when I had that \\"Ah-ha!\\" moment.  My rating for the book immediately jumped up to four stars with these final chapters.  Now I felt like I better understood where the author was going with the story as a whole.  And now I could appreciate it more for what it was.  In fact, I went back and re-read sections of the book because now they made more sense to me than they had when I first read them.  I felt like \\"Life of Pi\\" was a modern day [[ASIN:0141036133 Animal Farm]], which I read oh-so-many years ago in my high school English class.<br /><br />Pi also questions religion in the book.  He feels that he should be fully knowledgeable about all religions before he can make an informed decision about any of them.  If only everybody was like that and went into everything with an open mind, right?  One of my favorite paragraphs in the book is when Pi questions Christianity and tries to understand its logic:<br /><br />  \\"Humanity sins but it's God's Son who pays the price?  I tried to imagine Father saying to me, \\"Piscine, a lion slipped into the llama pen today and killed two llamas.  Yesterday another one killed a black buck.  Last week two of them at the camel.  The week before it was painted storks and grey herons.  Any who's to say for sure who snacked on our golden agouti?  The situation has become intolerable.  Something must be done.  I have decided that the only way the lions can atone for their sins is if I feed you to them.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Yes, Father, that would be the right and logical thing to do.  Give me a moment to wash up.\\"\\"<br /><br />Like \\"Animal Farm,\\" \\"Life of Pi\\" is sure to be a book studied in English literature classes for its nuances and literary devices in years to come.the book.

B005DMNS4A|5.0|This album is a concept album about teenage angst sang from all different angles and perspectives. It's flow is very similar to how \\"Tommy\\" worked in the sense that all the songs connect to a general theme and the music is arranged in an orchestral fashion. Sometimes this album can get pretty dark lyric wise and the music also sometimes reflects teenage frustration. The music has the rock and roll feel embedded in it but at the same time, psychedelic tendencies are found a lot throughout the album. Even in an album about how hard life is as a teenager, the lyrics have glimpses of hope and messages about rising above it all. This is definitely one of the Who's best albums, right up there with \\"Who's Next?\\" and \\"Tommy\\". It took me a couple listens to completely absorb it all but every time I finished the album, I wanted to push the play button again so I highly recommend this album to Who fans and to people who like psychedelic rock or rock that has a raw honest quality to it with amazing arrangements and composition.<br /><br />Buy.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|One of the best books I have read! Great message of love, truth and hope --authentically written --completely believable. Cuts right to the core of what really matters in our lives.  Everybody needs to read it!
B007SUW24W|4.0|I'm from Uruguay living in Brazil (Sao Paulo), so I was a little bit worried about the shipping, but fortunately the album arrived before the date set as ETA and in perfect conditions, no issues with the packaging.<br />Nice album, very nice voice, nice guitar playing. Not so good art in the album, I mean, no pictures or elaborated cover, which nowadays I feel like a down point. It is so easy to buy music online that I expect more from the art of the CD albums... anyhow, great album, great talent. Nice music, album art could be better though ...

B005HJWWW8|1.0|It took some searching on the interwebs to discover I have a defective unit. When I plug it into a USB charger, I can turn it on, and use it, and it sounds fine. But the battery won't charge. Nowhere in the manual does it mention that the red LED should glow steadily during charging. Mine blinks rapidly, which indicates it's not charging.<br /><br />I ending up sourcing another from a local reseller, and it works and sounds great, but beware - there evidently was a run of defective batteries sometime around the end of August 2012, and those units have a high instance of this happening. If the packaging is the newer \\"Fujiyama\\" package, and there's NO silver scratch-off sticker on the package, then this is potentially one of the defective units. Reseller said he got about 20-25% returns.

0374533571|5.0|A friend gave me this book to read last summer, and I just got around to reading it.  Finished it in one day.  Mr. Quick uses football as a literary device to advance the story of a young man recently released from a psychiatric facility.  The characters are quirky and engaging and Quick nails the issues plaguing a very dysfunctional family. Congratulations to Mr. Quick for a marvelous debut novel.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|On average, this reader consumes two or three books per week. Mysteries and thrillers are my primary areas of interest.  I used to really look forward to reading about the exploits of Dr. Scarpetta.  Ms. Cornwell appears to have become fixated on this micro genre since her book about Jack the Ripper.  It seems as though the author has taken this series to such a shocking and depressingly dark side that I will probably never read another book.  The Bone Bed is a disjointed series of interactions between the pathologist and her band of dysfunctional characters that never reaches anything like a conclusion.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|My first book of Morton's was The Forgotten Garden, and I was completely hooked. When I realized she had other books, I knew I'd have to read them all.<br /><br />Something about Morton's style - she is extremely detailed. Sometimes to the point where I skip some paragraphs (I can be a little impatient...) to get to the good stuff. The positive of this - she knows how to set a scene that twists the reader's emotions into exactly how she wants you to feel about the character(s). One minute you think you understand what is going on, then the next Morton is making you consider another emotion you had no idea you could feel for a character. The negative of detail - it makes for a long story that I sometimes wonder if it could be shortened and have the same effect. Just a heads up.<br /><br />Having said that, Morton's novels are wonderfully written and completely enthralling. There may be slow parts throughout The Distant Hours, but she rewards you at every turn. The reader will not want to put down this book in hopes that he/she will reach a conclusion at &#34;just one more chapter&#34; (which I often found myself saying). And, like I mentioned before, just when you decide to side with one character, a flaw is exposed that makes you question that character's motive. Is everything really as it seems?<br /><br />The reader will find that it's not, as Morton spins a tale that will leave you reeling days after the final page is read. I did not predict the end, as some other reviewers have, but I suppose every person is different. I enjoy the surprise, so I insist on letting the story lead me instead of the reverse. It was easy to do this with The Distant Hours because the suspense will keep you coming back for more.

B0058VW36U|5.0|hi my name is Noah. don't worry because you cant get all three stars.thats why I'm here.I'll show you how to do it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|When I read the first book I felt that was enough.  I had a friend who had completed the triology and she told me to just get through the first book because the other two were so good.  She was right.  Kept me up at night just wanting to get to the next chapter.  Ending surprised me but I loved it!
B00742GBDM|4.0|An enjoyable production yet less rich in texture and character. Difficult to overcome the revelation that her benefactor is a murdering, rapist slave trader....pretty unforgivable and certainly impossible to continue to live under his roof in any way..yet this point is overlooked too easily in the film and the book.  In the end the horror of it sat with me rather than what was perhaps the intention of the story which is, like all Jane's works..the conflict of living a \\"good\\" life which isn't cripled by poverity, with the search and hope of finding Love and a Truth of intimacy.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read 50 Shades of Grey and loved this just as much. It was nice that you were able to get into the minds of both characters and not just one. To be loved by one person so deeply is a dream but can be scary as well. I couldn't wait for the second book.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I've been an Aerosmith fan all my life and remember buying there first album when it can out. I have to agree with Brad Whitford and the guys in the band. This CD is one of the best by the boys from Boston. There's a lot of great things on the CD and I'm glad it's out. I could list a lot of information about the CD but let the music be the judge. It rocks!!!
B007HU7NBK|4.0|So its very hard to write an unbiased review and I feel as though because I am such a fan, its difficult for me to say anything negative?  I've read both John's and Andy's books and there are definitely similarities.  Both didn't go too much into the gory details but when you combine the story's you get a clearer picture of Duran Duran and really, its quite a great story!  You have childhood friends, who form a band, achieve success beyond their wildest dreams and 30+ years later are continuing and thriving...despite their inner turmoils (personally & amongst each other).<br /><br />From a writing perspective, John definitely had the better book.  Although it seemingly ended a little abruptly at Coachella, I was a little disappointed the book ended it was such a pleasure to read. The most interesting aspect that I took away (from both books) was that they were/are not just a band, but friends (and in many ways family).  A must read for a Duran Duran fan, and even more of a must read for those critics...but that won't happen.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Killing Floor is a wonderfully complex plot in a simple town.  Reacher continues is brilliant deduction and fierce defence of what is right!  A great page turner.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is a great classic movie. We watch it all year long not just at Christmas. My grandson loves anything to do with Trains.
0689815816|5.0|The board book was perfect for 6 month old grandchild.  Nice story and pictures.  Love to read it to her.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Very touching, lively and funny. You almost overlook the positive messages in the storyline!  Great for young and old alike!
B0058YPGSY|1.0|Disc 1 had numerous sections where the video came to a screeching halt. Disc 2 had no audio. The audio on disc 3 was covered by the audio from disc 2. We did not try disc 4. Are these pirated DVDs being sold as the real deal???
1451695195|2.0|There is absolutely no biblical backing in this story whatsoever. He doesn't meet Jesus, he even condones meditation(new age) and \\"Hemi-Sync\\" out of body experiences, which are absolutely against the bible. Although I don't doubt his experience, I do, however, doubt its origins......
B009FBX5M0|2.0|How disappointing to buy this soundtrack of the long awaited Skyfall and  find out that the Skyfall Theme of Adele's is not on it. Must be purchased seperate. I have every 007 soundtrack to date and this is first one to be released this way.Kind of steals some of the thrill.<br />Thank you.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Told from an interesting perspective and well written. I have recommended this book to everyone I know that likes to read.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This is a flick that Joe Bob Briggs would love. While deficient in motor vehicle chases (no motor vehicles), no beasts (but some pretty beastly Chinese gangsters) and only two (ceramic) breasts, The Man with the Iron Fists is an excellent chop socky movie. We have spinning assassin bimbo fu, truly overwhelming Chinese Whore-Lady fu with a cast of dozens of flying Beautiful Chinese Ninja Whore-Ladies, a ex-slave Hero (RZA) who trades in his `fro for `fu training at the same Shaolin temple that trained John Carradine, a baddy (Dave Bautista)that turns into a brass table lamp every time someone tries to stick him (which happens a lot) and lots and _lots_ of straight and fancy kung fu. In a movie first, Russell Crowe performs Ben Wa Ball fu on one of the Chinese Whore-Ladies.<br />We have heads rolling, eyes rolling, hands rolling and stomachs rolling. We have a baddie dragged into the gears for a really messy exit, Squirt! At the other end of the ceramic breasts, is the lock to the Secret Tunnel (tm) and the Head Whore-Lady (Lucy Lui) thrusts a foot-long key straight in there to unlock the Hidden Door.<br />The scenery-chewing was awesome, especially Russell Crowe's Chinese \\"disguise\\" (coolie hat, slanty-eyed mascara). The score is excellent and subtle, bringing in references to other Manly Movies. Several times, I expected Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood to stride in from stage right and left respectively.<br />Five Stars: Check it out.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, and I couldn't wait to get this one on my Kindle.  I thought this installment was just okay.  I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down, and that's saying something.  However, I didn't love it.  I definitely didn't hate it either.  I just thought that it didn't develop the story and Jack's character as well as the previous Jack Reacher adventures.  (I have to admit that my opinion is probably a little bit swayed at this point by the selection of Tom Cruise to portray Jack Reacher in the upcoming movie...really?  He is like 100 pounds too light and a foot too short.  I was completely bummed that Tom Cruise is portraying this iconic character.  Soooo not right.)  I thought Jack Reacher was kind of phoning it in for this installment.  The whole secret witness-protection-motel-enclosure-thing was a bit of a reach.  I am waiting for the next novel...with cautious optimism.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have owned Sony Pro 7506 headphones for 10 plus years and they still sound great.  I am on Amazon replacing the ear pads which have worn out over the years; this is the only maintenance that has been needed.  I am excited that Sony sells them separately where they can be replaced.  I am a DJ, Producer, and Engineer, I have owned many other brands and these have stood the test of time.  These are my \\"go to\\" headphones and have been dependable i ever environment.  The metal used in the construct of the Sony 7506 make all the difference.  They are durable and have not broke at the hinges like the others I've owned.  Most other brands and consumer Sony models use that dense plastic that WILL CRACK and break sooner or later.  Don't get caught up in all these other trendy Brands; Bose is not worth the money.  I really like the way Beats by Dre sound, but they are ridiculously priced and not built to last.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|Season 3 only has half the shows it's suppose to have.  The guide lists 8 episodes per disc but each disc only has 4.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and addicting, you just cant wait tooo see what the next game is. some are easy and some are hard but its definatly worth downloading
B007TR1R22|1.0|Un film falto de acción, más aburrida parece imposible. La actriz protagonista no parecia creerse el papel. La banda sonora parecia de una banda desafinada. El actor protagonista, ausente todo el rato y el pobre marido, ni sabia dar pena. Cuesta hacerlo peor. Muy aburrida.
B00913DPW2|3.0|Kept getting stuck and had to restart from the beginning. my daughter bought haunt2 and couldn't even install it. pretty disappointing.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Glad I finally picked this up to read after seeing a great review for the fourth book, The Son, in this series.  Figured I'd start with the first to see how it was.  Great book.  Moves quickly, characters well developed, and interesting dystopian plot.  I think it's a good book for all ages.  It's also a commentary on society without being preachy.  I've since read the second in the series's and look forward to the next two as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ya that's right 0.5.0 will be out this month Witch is  November but will be sometime in November hope its soon.<br />for more info ask.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The premise of this book is different than most.  A man takes on a journey to save a friend from cancer only to save himself.  I wanted to dislike Harold for his choice to make this journey, but I began to relate to his need to search for something more in his life.  There are a few unexpected surprises.  And a satisfying resolution at the end.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Phenomenal amount of spelling errors combined with grammatical errors detain from an even reading of a great great epic saga. The proofreaders should be fired for typing the word \\"that\\" instead of \\"than\\" or \\"then\\". Great story, horrible transcription & proof reading. Halfway through, I turned the kindle off & went back to my hard copy.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Now we finally get the other side of the story and not Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons' \\"Official Version\\" of the history of KISS.<br />This coupled with Ace's bio gives fans the full story of how the greatest band in the world got started, made history, and imploded.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. run out of energy too quickly. just started playing. have not put any money into yet. that is the only thing I do not like about these games
B00000DI06|5.0|I performed 'Magnificat' piece with mass festival choir a few years ago at Carnegie Hall under Mr. Rutter's baton.<br />A wonderful piece. Hard not to get emotional and stay focused when the key changes happen at the end. 'Requiem' is very beautiful as well.
B005RK6EUS|5.0|This River-Doctor story arc is multi-layered, worth watching more than once, and contains the most meaningful episodes of this series for me. The prior River-Doctor episodes are Silence in the Library, Forest of the Dead, Time of Angels, Flesh and Stone, The Pandorica Opens, The Big Bang, The Impossible Astronaut, Day of the Moon, A Good Man Goes to War and Let's Kill Hitler before this episode, and The Angels Take Manhattan after this episode. Whenever scriptwriter Steven Moffat's name is on Doctor Who's opening credits, the show is going to be amazing!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|It was nice to read a fresh look at the fantasy genre. The book was by far my favourite read of 2012.
B008NBEY3C|2.0|Due to the apparent popularity of recent large box set releases, some labels are seemingly reissuing EVERYTHING, which leads to scraping up some pretty unlikely candidates.  Glenn Gould, Artur Rubinstein, Claudio Arrau, and Leopold Stokowski are worthy \\"big box\\" releases, but Murray Perahia?  I've even seen a new release of the largely forgotten William Steinberg.<br /><br />Unless Perahia has a very large extended family, I expect this set to shortly be heavily discounted.  So if you want it, wait a coupla months and get it cheaper.<br /><br />[By-the-way, since I posted this review, the price has dropped 50%.]
B007SGM084|2.0|Interesting for the first book, lost interest shortly into the second book. Steamy scenes got very repetitive, and there was not enough plot to make up for it.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|An unbelievably horrid movie.  Total waste of my time to watch.  I'd heard that Tom Cruise was supposed to be amazing in it, but even his stellar performance couldn't save this awful film.  That's 124 minutes I won't get back....
B007SGLZP8|2.0|not a typical Grisham effort, unlike his other books this one is an over the top fantasy very hard to believe hard to read....hard to read meaning it hurts.
145210655X|4.0|This is simply a series of vignettes rather than anything resembling a story. And it feels just a bit like cheating to use one of the largest brands in entertainment to one's own ends, presumably without the express permission of George Lucas. But that said, Brown's take is undeniably funny, charmingly rendered, and even, at times, insightful. Probably more fun for thirty-something fathers than their offspring, but thirty-something fathers need fun, too. And in all fairness, George Lucas can probably squeak by without a cut of these particular royalties.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I'm still reading this book, but I totally recommend it. My mother in law recommended it. I'm a life coach and it has been totally worth reading it.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Loving frank was informative, entertaining, easy to read and a very compelling look at a wonderful artist's life. Also interesting because of the women's rights issues of that time period.
1608862801|5.0|Ryan North delivers an extremely funny and fun-filled comic adventure for children and adults, who love comics. The characters come to life, and the story is intriguing as we witness destruction and chaos in this colorful issue, with stunning illustrations. We meet the good, the bad, and the ugly as we become curious to discover who the hero is. Ryan North aims to please the reader in all his books, and his work is incredible, especially for comic lovers who continue to add issues to their collection. This Adventure is entertaining from beginning to end, and enjoyable. A great gift for friends and family, especially for that special occasion. Highly Recommended!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The Hunger Games movie stayed true to the novel as much as possible and Katniss was cast perfectly.  Can't wait till the next installment !
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Really good app! It is easy to use do, which leaves too brain the energy for the exercises.  I like it
B008D490F6|5.0|I used to love watching this movie when I was younger and still enjoy it now. I have kids 3 and 6 years old and they now love it as well! A classic for any collection.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is the second team lava game I took on (the first is restaurant story) and this game is just as cute and addicting as the first. another good thing is, unlike most games, you can receive gold as a gift from your friends and save it for premium items. you aren't forced into spending real money like so many other games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app downloaded on my kindle fire and on my epic. The only complaint I have is the ads, and even those are easy to skip.  I definitely recommend it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game now has me getting up 15 minutes earlier every day just to care for my dragons. It's a fun game, but be warned - it is quite addicting!
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Too long, if it wasn't for the music this movie would be close to unbearable. The performances were solid,especially Tom Cruise, the singing was surprisingly good,but the story was flat and long-winded. I have seen worse but I have seen much better.
0553386794|1.0|This is an interesting exploration of mixing genres. I am not sure if anyone has said this yet. Most likely someone has since there are over a thousand reviews. But this is not really fantasy, it is a soap opera set in a Medieval English outfit. It reminds me of the show on HBO called the Tudors. But that at least was oriented around King Henry. In this book and this series the story is all over the place, exactly like a soap opera. The soap is always appearing to go somewhere important but never gets there.<br /><br />I have to say that I think that the author mixes the two genres well, and manages to keep the reader hooked. However, I felt in the end disappointed, becasue of course, soaps really never do lead anywhere, and I suspect this one won't either. If the author is the post modern literary novelist I suspect he is, he may well pull a Thomas Pynchon on everyone and have the story unravel in a very unsatisfying fashion in the end. I kind of hope he does. Gravity's Rainbow, however, did it first.<br /><br />Maybe someday students will be reading this series in university literature classes and talking about how it deconstructs the expectations of the novel and the fantasy genre. But, of course, that has all, already been done. So in the end, I am not sure what the point is.  It is just a good soap. It is entertainment in this endless cheap episodic fashion. One where you learn to not care too much for the characters, but then do anyway, and then get  jerked around when they die for no reason, or change. And life can be this way too, it very often is, in middle school. It is the most shallow level of entertainment one can create when one writes. One writes just to keep it going, not with a vision of life, of meaning or purpose that is being expressed or explored. It took me a while to figure it out, but once I got it I read it on the surface to see how the two blended only from a literary interest but it added nothing to my life.<br /><br />In the end, there is nothing but the sound and the fury. For me at least, I look for something and someone who writes with a deeper vision of reality. See, &#34;100 years of Solitude.&#34; Not someone who can just keep a 100 balls in the air. And to close my argument, this series is now on HBO, being shown in episode after episode, just like a what, you got it, a soap. I think fanasty would be better off sticking with its own genre conventions and then working to express them in new ways rather than blending genres and cheapening the genre itself.nothing but the sound and the fury.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|Fantastic movie...not for the acting because that was lacking, but definitely because Channing Tatum is a beautiful man who can definitely move! Totally awesome movie to watch with your girlfriends for a bachelorette party, if you're staying in and keeping it low key but need some excitement!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Use to play this game at carnivals. Love this game and a great game to pass the time. Fills up with more coins every hour and had no glitches on my KF. I recommend this game.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|The box for this set is about 4 inches by 5 inches.  IT'S TINY!  I can't believe the horror I went through to try and get one of these sets for the original (INFLATED) LEGO price!  I was okay with the $35 price UNTIL WE GOT THE BOX!  Now I'm scrambling to figure out what other set to give my son - this was meant to be his one special gift for Christmas but it will literally fit in his stocking.  For $10 more I could have gotten a star wars or spongebob set that's big and would actually take time to put together.  I have no delusion this LEGO set could be any kind of fun compared to the fun he has online with the game... I'm really disappointed!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game its so addicting!!! This game has so many characters I have gotten all of them!! This game I reccommend for everyone! !!
B008S80OU2|5.0|BOC has never sounded better!  I've been listening to this on a laptop with cheap headphones, and yet the sound is the best I've heard - the lyrics are much more decipherable (and that's saying a lot for THIS band!), that loud annoying hiss on \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" is GONE, and even their first album sounds better than ever.<br /><br />Minor quibbles: the liner notes are unbelievably pretentious, and it left me confused about the band.  In the future, please stick to plain English and get to the frickin' point.  As for the bonus tracks, well... perhaps BOC should stick to metal; it's what they do best.<br /><br />Still, considering what this band has been through - especially the wholesale line-up changes - they leave a great legacy.  And this box set lives up to that legacy.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The best show on TV today! It's great to be able to download and watch an episode that you missed.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Nice and Addictive App. Sometimes you'll keep playing for hours and sometimes you'll keep thinking how to solve the building of that bridge.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Processor is working flawlessly, boosted WEI to 7.7 over the I3-2105's 7.1 that it replaced. Also with a corsair A50 is running 10 Celsius cooler than the I3 with a stock cooler (probably just as it should be). Still waiting on a Z77 board to overclock but paired fine with a P8H67-M LE.  Very Happy
0399157565|1.0|This book is truly a waste of time and quite unreal. Scarpetta continues to put up with Marino's abuse even though he is her employee, supposedly really loves her husband but constantly complains about him. You would think she is man-hater! Her niece causes her untold problems and puts her at risk. These are the three closest people to her. Sounds like a dysfunctional<br />family and is very tiresome. I've crossed this author off my list for good. It's like a bad soap opera with a murder or two thrown in.
B00992CF6W|4.0|when you go to crafting you see armor and a panting but you cant craft it i just think its weird.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|Having not seen the TV programme, my review is based on the first book only.<br />I am thoroughly enjoying Game of Thrones, particularly how the story is told through many perspectives. However this means that you must constantly be on the ball in order to remember how everyone relates to one another, and what they know, and whose 'side' they are on. If a day goes by when I haven't read the book, I have to really concentrate in order to 'catch up', and this makes for tiring reading. I am also a fast reader, and yet the book DOES seem to go on forever.<br />Nonetheless, the themes are explored well, and the characters are gripping. I would recommend this.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I just purchased this about 15 minutes ago and it has not been downloaded to my Kindle Fire!  I have tried touching open from the app store but it takes me to Angry Birds Seasons. Where is my purchase?!?!?! I will gladly update my review once I get it. Until then buyer beware.<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br /><br />I had called customer service after my initial post as was advised that it could take up to 4 hours for the authorized purchase to go through and make this app available.  I synced my Kindle Fire approx 6 hours after the call (2pm est) and it downloaded to my Kindle.<br /><br />I love this game!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you are a Star Wars fanatic, you must get this either from here or you can download from google for free with adds.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love, love, love this game. \\"Just one more game and I will put it down.\\"... 4 hours later...... \\"One more!\\".  I was so sad after I completed all levels, but you can clear them and start again!!
B007EDYN36|2.0|I ama a Kiss fan, but reading this just made me feel dirty. Peter comes across as unintelligent, uneducated and incapable of taking any repsonsibility for his problems.  A few good stories but really pathetic, mostly. I can see why Gene and Paul can't work with him.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|the serration sharpener is nice to have but is a little too coarse. the angle on the carbide and ceramic slots is too obtuse for most blades.<br />good to have in a pinch.
B000ID37KO|5.0|A seriously creepy film. Getting the kids away is one of the all-time suspense sequences.<br /><br />My only cavil is the packaging. There isn't any. You get a box and a disc and that is it. A card with even minimal info on the film would be nice.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great Movie.  I ordered this pre-sale, and when the price was lowered on the day it was released, I was charged the lower price.  Thank you!  I highly recommend this movie to everyone who loves action/adventure movies
B0066WJLU6|5.0|My little sister and I love doing the differant colors. It's also good for reading. It is the best flashlight app!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Loved the book; very well written; kept you wanting more.  The characters were well drawn and the flow of the story continued to keep you engrossed in the story.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|THE LORAX is such a great family film, one of the best in a long time.  It stays true to the Dr. Seuss book, but also puts its own creative spin on the classic.  The new full-length animated film version features awesome songs and music, great voice acting, and an outstanding environmental message.  Every family should watch this film together and discuss it afterward.  Great film!
B009JNXK88|4.0|I was honestly surprised with how well this game actually works considering it's a twitchy platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy that uses touch screen &quot;buttons.&quot; The game gives you two primary goals for each level that can be fulfilled on the same run or at separate times. The primary goal is to beat goal time for a star ranking; the secondary goal is to find a hidden briefcase somewhere in the level. Levels are usually small and seem to be designed around the limitations of the game's controls. They feel challenging but don't have the unforgiving margins for error of something like SMB (at least not in any of the levels I've played so far). That being said I do have a few gripes with this game. First, the timer that is so key to determining your score doesn't stop immediately upon completing the level. It actually continues for about another second while the villain at the end of every level plays out their death animation. This can be very frustrating when that one second costs you a star. Second, their is no option for mapping controls to a physical keyboard. I know that only a limited number of phones have keyboards, but for a game like this the option feels like an upsetting oversight.<br /><br />One last note: a lot of reviewers a complaining about the &quot;ghosts&quot; to appear after you die. I didn't have any problems with them. They are very transparent and are a typical feature of a game like this. If you do find them distracting though they are easily turned off.
0394818237|4.0|My 3.5 yr old daughter can't get enough of this book! The characters bring back such fond memories for me.
B006903GX8|5.0|I loved the way this book approached the time and backgrown for this wonderful PBS presentation.  It gives us a lot of facts of the pre-WW1 era and then the post time look.  The changes that happen due to different circumstances such as the loss of the young male population, the economy, the change of the old Aristocracy.  The coming of age into the early 1990's, and the changes with came with the introduction of electricity, the automobile, the telephone, the change in travel.  So many things happen during this time frame.  The portrait given of each character and the actor chosen to play them.  I loved the book and an totally enamored of the production.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I love the book and the series. Goerge Martin is a skilled writer and story teller. his presentation follows a story line but he keeps me guessing as to what will happen next. His words draw detail pictures of scenes and descriptions of people in my mind.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book--finished it in 3 days in spite of work.  With it's twists and turns it kept me reading as I just had to see where he was going with this.  I would never have expected the ending.  Grisham has tried his hand at other types of fiction, and I've not always enjoyed those  books.  With his return to his more traditional Grisham style legal thriller he is back in his best form.  This one was riveting, and I hope he continues on this track.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Enjoyed the plot as well as unexpected deaths...became very emotional during viewing.Was inspired to read the comic version to see what to expect in the future..however it seems like the good guys are being wiped out and the wicked remain to do more damage.Don't know if I can live with watching good characters being eliminated. Seems like \\"there is no hope\\" (spoken by Hershel during conversation with Rick. Also the writer Kirk what's his face says with glee ..\\"people are going to die..! so what;s the use? I like fantasy but would like  more hopeful endings. How ever I am<br />hooked to this show..fantastic actors..realistic blood and gore...keep it coming.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Can't put it down, feel like you're #2 in line, busting down doors or sitting next to Chris in a meeting with Village Elders.  Written in an honest and personable style; no Chris can not disclose every detail, but if it has been declassified, Chris tells you like it is.  A must read if you care about those who go in harms way, every day, to preserve our freedoms and help others kick the crap out of tyranny.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I had a terrible time reading this book.  It was so sordid and I kept confusing some of the characters.  What a nasty bunch of people.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I appreciate that this Neurosurgeon has offered to share his experience. You will read half the book before you realize that you have already read the part about his NDE. Using the term \\"OM\\" for God was explained but not in a way that was understandable. The ending was interesting. I have to admit, there was tons of advertizing and hype about this book and I pre-ordered and once I received it,, it was a bit disappointing. I will say that it was worth the read just to hear the opinion from a neurosurgeon.
0785163174|1.0|i just received my copy today and thought i would get the word out before other people buy it, this does not include the digital code for the digital copy like the description says it does. my brand new copy just received has nothing but a blank box where the code should be, looks like a printing error so buyer be ware.<br /><br />update- i reached out to marvel and they where able to help resolve the missing code issue promptly
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Alexander's visit to Heaven.  I have believed this way most of my life and I really liked how he explained his experience without religious jargon and getting caught up in a particular theology.  I've gone to bible college and we, as Christians, can get stuck solidly in what we believe.  Then our heart and mind are unable to accept anything other than what we've been taught.  I had been struggling with what I believe about God and about life after this life so this book came into my life at just the right time.  I've always known that the language of Heaven is love and if we can achieve the simplicity of that we're getting closer all the time!!  I highly recommend it to someone who struggles to believe.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|For me Winter of the World was more exciting than Fall of the Giants as the characters developed into more interesting people.  The details of history is outstanding as usual with the authors attention to facts woven into fiction  Ken, you have left the reader hanging for the final installment. Please don't be long with it!<br /><br />Really enjoyed the first book in this trilogy and was very happy I had my kindle to read the second in the trilogy due to the size of the hardcover...I could take it everywhere!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Mind games between the major characters plus the author and reader. You don't need to like the characters to love this book. Twisted minds and twisted plot (in  good way). Have fun with this page-turner.

B0026WNGBA|5.0|I have been running for over 10 years and struggling to improve my pace, no matter which methods I have tried. I just figured I am slow to improve. Maybe running is not my thing. I was intrigued about the barefoot running concept so I picked up this book. After reading just a few chapters of ChiRunning, I went out for an easy run and tried out some of the strategies. First - I ran over 3 miles without an issue (this distance is tough for me) second - a whole minute per mile was shaved off my usual pace. Just like that. BOOM. An improvement that was once only attainable after months of dedicated training (suffering) was achieved instantly. I attribute it mostly to the advice on proper running form, however I like the way it is explained and the emphasis on mindfulness. I am into yoga/meditation and all that so I can connect well to this method.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|I have played a few of these types of games, (Hidden/Find with a graphic storyline), and I have to say this is the hardest one yet.  As in, there is not enough information to let you know what you need to do to figure stuff out.  There is nothing fun about that.  I understand when you need to figure certain things out when playing games, but to literally not have a clue, (no pun intended), on what you are suppose to be doing?  Even when the \\"Instructions\\" don't explain really what you're suppose to do!  COME ON!  I am not happy there wasn't a Free sample so I could have at least seen if this was a game for me.  (All the others had this and I ended up purchasing the Full Edition.)<br /><br />I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it does have some good graphics, fun hidden/find games and IF you can figure out the other things to do, you have a good game.  However, I just can't really recommend this game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really like this series. Gideon is such a mystery and it finally comes together at the very end. What will happen next??
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of my favorite arcade game. I could waste hours playing it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|Without \\"When Love Is Gone,\\" I cannot rate this Blu-ray any higher than 3 stars.  That song/scene is crucial to the film, and shouldn't have been cut.  Shame on you, Disney.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Like so many others, I was introduced to Imagine Dragons through their hit song \\"It's Time\\". Out of curiosity, I got onto Spotify and listened to the rest of their music and instantly fell head over heels in love with the sound. My husband, who is much pickier than me (and considers himself a music connoisseur) happened to hear what I was playing, came into the room, and also immediately fell head over heels in love with the sound. Needless to say, we rushed out, bought the cd, and it hasn't left our cd player since.<br />The thing that makes Imagine Dragons so great is that you can compare them to a lot of talented bands (Coldplay is the one I've heard the most) and at the same time, to none at all. They're original and have carved out a well earned unique place for themselves with their strong, emotional lyrics and incredible music. I have never before been able to say that I liked every single song on a cd but this time I can. Sure, they won't be for everyone, but if you like at least one of their songs, chances are, you will love all of them. Honestly, I hope to see much more from them and the next time they come to my area in concert, I will be the first in line.

B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank Ocean really has redefined himself from his OFWGKTA days.  You should definitely buy the entire album, all of the songs really come together for a listening experience.  No one has a voice as smooth as Ocean's these days.  Plus Amazon's price is cheaper than iTunes.
0307474259|5.0|This is a most interesting book.  For many, it just could be the most important read of their lives!  In just 216 pages, Gary Taubes turns the great majority of the popular wisdom on why we get fat, obese, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc., on its ear and presents an entirely different (but highly credible and exhaustively researched) narrative on why and how we gain excess fat.  I cannot recommend this book too highly to anyone dealing with too much weight and flab!
B0098460O4|5.0|It is like listening to a heavenly choir! So glad that I stumbled across their Videos on You Tube! I hope that they will be making many more CDs!!!!!
B008NR90HQ|5.0|When one thinks of later Gary Moore you think Gibson Les Pauls. On this live disc, with the exception of a Flying V, he straps on Fender Strats and plays some of the best Hendrix covers you ever heard. Doesn't matter if you're a Hendrix fan or not, if you're a fan of wailing guitar this disc is a must have. How Gary Moore is not on every list of great rock guitar players boggles the mind; from sweet Peter Green licks to fretboard tapping metal this guy did it all, and did it great. RIP Gary, this guitar player misses the inspiration you provided. Joe Bonamassa? Hah!
B004UB9SKS|4.0|I bought this translation app before I received my new paperwhite.  It works on my fire but not the paperwhite.  I don't want to have to take both kindles on my trip.  I can't find a decent translation app for the paperwhite.  There should have been a warning notice before I went and purchased the paperwhite.  I bought it for my trip for reading, getting on line and using the Japanese translation app.  I'm so disappointed.<br /><br />(This would be a very helpful app if it worked on my paperwhite. I can't do another review of the paperwhite or I would have written this there.)

B0070NSPCU|4.0|I had been looking about for some decent fantasy during the long, long winter before the next GRRM installment. \\"Huh, what's this?\\" I thought as I clicked on to Raven's Shadow, \\"a five star rating over hundreds of reviews?\\". Like many other readers, I thought Anthony Ryan had either bribed people to review for him, had a knack for creating intelligent bots, or was simply an exceptionally popular guy.<br /><br />Maybe all of these are still true, but this book was fantastic. The premise may sound familiar, particularly to fans of Rothfuss - hero tells his story to a scribe, outlining his rise to fame / infamy, starting with his training at the hands of a mysterious school - but the execution is still very fresh.<br /><br />Two small caveats: I thought the editing could have been a little tighter, and the overuse of commas, though entirely forgivable, does interrupt the flow of the story from time to time. I look forward not only to the next installment in the trilogy, but also the print version of Blood Song.<br /><br />**some of the high points for me: SMALL SPOILERS to follow**<br /><br />Vaelin is a likeable character who (as many other reviewers have pointed out) doesn't spend too much time fretting over the unpleasant jobs he has to do, only letting things bother him when they become significant. This was good; since he racks up a fairly high body count by the end, the last thing I wanted was hand-wringing over the dilemma of doing his job (as a soldier!) every time he felled an enemy.<br /><br />Since he is likeable, it follows that he has several fast friends throughout the book. These friends initally look like they could be cardboard cutouts, and sure, a few of them remain relatively one-dimensional, but I never felt they existed for the purpose of giving Vaelin someone to talk to. (I particularly hope to find out more about Nortah and Caenis). Furthermore, even though Vaelin has to be the star of the show, all of them have their own talents. This compares well to Rothfuss, where I was never convinced by the interaction between Kvothe and, uh, you know, those two guys he sometimes hung around with while he was learning stuff really quickly and showing false maturity where it was completely unexpected...<br /><br />In fact, generally, characters here don't have implausible knowledge - e.g. the 'Hope', introduced by the scribe at the start, initially sounds incredibly significant. To Vaelin, however, he's just some guy he kills in battle...what's the big deal?!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I started watching the show and decided to order the first book to read via my Kindle Fire.  I probably was about halfway through the book and I got an e-mail that the 5 book bundle was available.  I was to be perfectly honest alittle annoyed that this offer came shortly after I had been reading the first book.  I didn't know that it came as a bundle.  I decided to buy the 5 book bundle, because I knew that I would buy the next book and then the next etc...  Anyway, needless to say I am fully enjoying reading the books.  I can go right on to the next book without having to \\"wait\\".  It was also alittle cheaper buying the bundle rather than purchasing each individual book.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game is challenging, this is the first time it has taken me a while to get thru a game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 3 doesn't dissapoint! This season is more gritty and emotional. Eventhough its only four episodes in, so many unexpected things have happened it leaves you wondering what they have in store next. Each episode has an element of mystery as to what happened in the eight months that they didn't show (so far anyways). Rick is certainly showing his grit as a leader and the group as a whole works together to ensure the safety & survival of each member.  This series captures the Zombie genre very well without being generic in its plot or special effects, if they had tried to put this story into a movie rather than a series, it would have ruined it. The first two seasons I loved and was very much looking forward to the third, I'm so glad that despite the fact I don't have AMC I'm able to watch them on Amazon. The only thing that dissapoints is the fact that I have to wait a week to find out what happens next!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was a pleasure to be able to watch the entire season at my leisure and not to have to wait a week between episodes. I love the show!
0307593312|3.0|three and a half stars<br /><br />For me as a reader, 1Q84 is a triumph of imagination and empathy--but it fails intellectually.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert: I will put in italics all commentary that reveals plot points or comments on the quality of the plot in this review:<br /><br />When I read the first two chapters of this very long novel, they struck me as brilliant. A story that begins with a clear sense of place and action, but wherein the most compelling storytelling method is internal. Murakami is telling us first Aomame and then Tengo's innermost thoughts, intense, enigmatic somatic sensations, and life-long concerns and preoccupations. *<br /><br />Aomame hears music that makes her feel as though all the organs of her body are being rung out. She knows numerous facts about this piece of music and has no idea why she knows these details. Intriguing. We immediately come to understand that she feels alienated and ill at ease in the world. Her strange name (which means \\"green peas\\") is a symbol of this alienation. We come to know her internal world very quickly. And her present situation is pregnant with mystery. All the same could be said of chapter two, narrated from Tengo's perspective.<br /><br />I was hooked.<br /><br />During the first hundred or so pages certain things came to seem unrealistic (by the middle of the book they seemed quite real) and twice I gave up on the story. The wonderful sense of the inner life of the characters seemed to go away for much of books one and two, coming back (BIG Spoiler Alert) when Aomame's new friend Ayumi is killed and she grieves for days.<br /><br />The New York Review of Books review calling this one of the most humane books in contemporary literature persuaded me to go back and I resumed 1Q84 and fell in love with it. Reading this book, for me, was like sitting down with a cup of white tea mixed with some sort of subtle, ambrosial citrus, peach, and floral top notes. Well, maybe that's going a bit far.... It was sometimes a bit like that, sometimes like holding in one's hand a stream of \\"sterling prose,\\" to use a phrase from the book; watching this stream, like a beautiful creek, flow by.<br /><br />I had expected Murakami to be frenetic and was surprised that I found this novel, the plot of which is so deeply creepy, so oddly soothing. I think it has to do with Murakami's startling surefootedness as a writer. The writing isn't flashy but it is, over 925 pages, nearly unerring. I found myself wanting to re-read entire sections. Nothing there that you would call GREAT poetry, yet somehow richly soothing and engaging.<br /><br />I wondered: What are these (Minor Spoiler), what are these \\"little people\\"?<br /><br />(More plot points to avoid if you want a truly virgin experience:)<br />What do the two moons mean, what does it mean that little people and air chrysalises have invaded the world, important details of history have been alerted???<br /><br />What a prodigiously imaginative world Murakami has created.<br /><br />I came to think that this story is perhaps a metaphor for cancer. A tumor of non-standard development has entered the world and it is trying to metastasize and spread, threatening to destroy what was there before. What real-world referent could this metaphor--a world that has developed a cancer-like infestation of insidious, for- most invisible, seemingly evil, invasive elements--be pointing to?<br /><br />What did it all mean? I was eager to find out.<br /><br />I also had a fear that all this might never connect with the world and the human condition we all share in any meaningful way. It might all turn out to be an expertly executed fable with no relevance to human life.<br /><br />Regrettably I would say that is the case. By page 900 I was wondering how all the enigmas that have built up can possibly be resolved? The answer: They are not. In the end we get no answers about the little people or Sakigake and the \\"voice\\" it depends on. We don't learn how Leader could do the seemingly unnatural things he did.<br /><br />Worse! (Big Spoiler)The suffering of Ishikawa and the ruined childhood and deformed (young) adult life of Fuka-Eri are simply discarded. The beautiful young protagonists ride their elevator up the high-rise floors to watch the moonrise (essentially drive off into the sunset) and all the rest is just a bad dream. A very conventional ending: Man and woman and baby-to-come equals all is right with the world. Mere lip service made to the idea that there will be new challenges in this world.<br /><br />This reduces the whole story to an elaborate \\"meet-cute\\" (or rather re-meet cute). I'm not anti-Hollywood but I expect more from literature (and from an author being talked about for the Nobel prize) and I am certain I have seen more consequent endings in good Hollywood movies.<br /><br />An ambiguous ending has its place, but this feels like a failure of ideas. One of the reviewers here (Shashank Singh) quotes Murakami as saying that the \\"paper moon\\" theme and ending illustrates that, today, nothing is real.(\\"We watch fake evening news,\\" etc.) That is an impoverished, even an immature, intellectual position. Despite whatever misinformation the media provides, the world is very real. Climate change is real. The ambitions of the multinational corporations to take over the globe and subvert democracy (more than they already have) are real. If Murakami wants to say that we live in an unreal world, and committing to each other and creating a private oasis of love is all that's real--that's too shallow an idea for a 925 page novel named after the signature work by George politics-was-his-middle-name (and he was utterly serious about human affairs) Orwell.<br /><br />I regret at this point that this review is so negative. I truly, truly enjoyed--deeply enjoyed--the 900 pages of the book before the disappointing ending began to loom on the horizon. I would say Murakami achieved a creative and emotional triumph (his sympathy for his characters is extremely refreshing), but he fell short intellectually.<br /><br />That disappointment has driven me to explore \\"Strong Motion\\" by Jonathan Franzen (< very good, and this from one who has had to overcome initial dislike of the harder edges--apparent mean-spiritedness, apparent but ultimately not actual--of Franzen's writing) and \\"Cloud Atlas\\" by David Mitchell. (I anticipate \\"Atlas\\" may be really brilliant in scope and seriousness--and entertaining all the while).<br /><br />If I could speak to Mr. Murakami, I would thank him for such a lovely book. I just don't find \\"Nothing is real now-a-days,\\" to be an intellectually serious point of view. The world, and its burgeoning problems, seems terribly real to me. **<br /><br />One of the reviewers here (briefingsforadescentintoliterature) may be right when he/she said that striving for achievement kills creativity. Better to let creativity flow.<br /><br />Easier said than done!<br /><br />footnotes:<br /><br />*(Is the comment about Kafka meant to come from Aomame or the narrator? We only learn around page 800 that there even is an omniscient narrator, but somehow that \\"mistake,\\" which an MFA class would have weeded out, is of no real consequence here.)<br /><br />**This review written ~5 p.m., Nov. 6th 2012

B0063GORYU|5.0|I think this game is enjoyable and it uses brain power. I have only mastered the two suit level so far, but hope to be able to do the 3&amp; 4 suits someday.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very simple game...at first. It's very addicting. As the levels increase the challenge increases. The lower levels are great for younger kids and the higher levels are challenging for adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book but it amazed me and reminded me why I love reading. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the app, my dad uses it on his Iphone and so I had to get it on my kindle. best sleep app ever!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love Solitaire, so as soon as I got my HTC Rhyme (and later a Kindle Fire) this app was the first to go on them! It's easy, convenient, and has nice features. In particular, I love that you can tap on a card and it will fly off to its match without you having to select where you want it to go. I never play anything outside of random games, so I cannot comment on the other options such as multiplayer. You can also decorate the background and the card backs, though this may be limited. While I can decorate at will on my HTC Rhyme, every time I try to load a background or card back on my Kindle Fire it tells me that it is unable to load selected image. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the app or my Fire, I'll admit, but the one star off is for this issue because I miss not being able to change anything there.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Watch the trailer. If you like it, do not miss this movie! The movie is like the trailer but even better. That's pretty rare but very true in this case.<br /><br />To be honest, while this is one of the best movies I've seen, most people I know wouldn't like it. Also someone with no memories of that era would have to miss a little of the richness of this masterpiece. Realistic in a way but more artistic in that it is a lie that tells the truth. And it does so beautifully.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is, for the most part, enjoyable. However, it has its fair share of issues. If you put your Kindle Fire asleep with the game running, you'll have to completely restart the app again because it just becomes a black screen. Also, the visiting random towns option seems broken as you can't do anything once you're there. All in all, it's a nice but problematic game.

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|Finally purchased the digital copy. Hadn't seen lyrics/liner notes offered before. That lack has kept me purchasing CD's. Kudos for a great debut album.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|It's been a good year for big classical box sets. Whether you're a fan of Arthur Rubenstein or Glenn Gould, whether you're interested in old Mercury Living Presence recordings or Karajan's recordings from the 1960s, on Toscanini's complete RCA recordings, you'll find something to fill your shelves and your ears.<br /><br />I've gotten three such sets recently: the 90-CD Yo-Yo Ma: 30 years Outside the Box set; the 42-disc Glenn Gould Complete Bach Collection, and, now, the Murray Perahia, The First 40 Years set. Interestingly, all three of these are from Sony, who is making a big effort lately to re-release back catalog in big boxes at bargain prices. (The Yo-Yo Ma was released in 2009, but the Gould and Perahia are new; in fact, they're out in Europe at the time of this writing, but not yet in the US.)<br /><br />All of these boxes are produced in a similar manner. The CDs are in slim wallet sleeves, with original artwork on them, and either the original backs from LPs in miniature or the flip side, or, for those discs originally released on CD, a track list that you can actually read. (The miniature LP notes require a microscope to read.) They're snuggly fit inside the box, and each of these sets has a hardcover book. The Murray Perahia book is the largest of all, in part because the 5 DVDs in the set are in an actual DVD-sized digipack; in the Glenn Gould set, the 6 DVDs are in the same kind of sleeves as the CDs.<br /><br />In all of these cases, the books are attractive and informative. They contain essays, photos and information about the discs. The Perahia book, being the largest, has the most notes about the discs, reproducing the original liner notes from each release.<br /><br />Murray Perahia's répertoire is fairly standard: There's a lot of Mozart (all the piano concertos), Chopin, Schumann, Schubert, Beethoven and Bach. There's a bit of Bartok, Brahms and Mendolssohn,, a disc of Handel and Scarlatti, but that's about it. Perahia was never an adventurousmusician in his recordings, he didn't stray from well-worn paths. I'm mostly familiar with his work in the Mozart piano concertos, which are wonderful, but when I actually discovered his pianism was when he released a recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations in 2000. This followed a period when he had a serious problem with one of his hands, which caused him to stop playing for several years. During this time, he studied Bach closely, and even played the harpsichord (which requires a bit less hand strength), and his Goldberg Variations, played on piano, have a unique sound, no doubt influenced by that period of harpsichord playing. Following this period, he recorded a number of works by Bach - notably the English Suites and Partitas - for the first time.<br /><br />There's a lot of music in this set, all of it familiar, but I'm looking forward to discovering this pianist whose approach is never dull and often interesting. One nice bonus is the 5 DVDs included, one of which features Perahia accompanying Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Winterreise, from 1990.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is fun and addicting, I just wish it started you with more coins or had mini games to play so you could earn coins.. they go fast then you have to wait or spend $ to get more..
B007SGLZP8|1.0|this is not the Grishman I have been reading in the past- couldn't wait to finish it, but not for the usual reasons- Title didn't seem to fit the content. Very disapointing!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This is a very good movie.  It kept my interest through most of the movie, there were some slow periods however.  I reccomend this movie.
B008Y1YKE4|1.0|I didn't buy this movie because I read the review and this movie is not for children. I also heard on TV that it was not a good movie for children. Grandpa Santa is drunk or drinking beer. Santa missed one child and was told thats ok it was only one child. If a child watches that moveie the child will be wondering if Santa was going to miss him. This movie is more for adults.
B009IA521U|4.0|Depending on your view of this music, Chopin is open to interpretation.  What I miss here is the \\"Polish\\" element in the music.  Whist LANG LANG plays with great skill and the recording is superb, I find that he isn't comprehending the Polish dance element, Chopins delicate recital style, the musical nationalism inherent from the history of Chopins' life.<br />While LANG LANG can blast out music on this Steinway, again full bodied sound and technically accomplished keyboard playing, I'm not sure I agree with his view of the music.<br />Even though LANG LANG chooses sensible tempos, his rubato is well judged, phrasing is in touch with Chopin, LANG LANG seeks virtuosity in much of this Chopin, while my preferences are for more lightly played, disciplined, musically varied styles in the Etudes, not just loud and fast.<br />Full credit though, goes to LANG LANG, for his musical genius, discography and output, interprative skills and providing a modern recording.<br />I suggest sampling before you buy to see if this disc fits the needs of your collection.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Commanding Hard Edged Bond Film<br /><br />QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a bit thin, but then again, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren&eacute; Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's \\"What's Keeping You Awake\\" is a very reflective piece and \\"Field Trip\\" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.
0062127241|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my husband who is a huge fan of Meher Baba and of Pete. This brave story of how the rock music scene<br />affected this sensitive artist is very touching. He has come through that maelstrom of fame and blame a stronger character, and certainly more<br />self aware. I appreciate any opportunity for the general public to have a few hints as to who Avatar Meher Baba was. He was the most signigicant<br />figure of the twentieth century, yet so few people have researched His life.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Cute creatures with fairly nice graphics. The hidden object aspect is surprisingly challenging and change each time. But the language is in broken English.
1475143389|5.0|I am very glad I bought this book. There are reaally good info on muscle building facts (and myths), nutrition, rest, water intake and much more. I have been following the one-year-program that comes as a bonus for a month now and I am very happy with it. I have also been talking to Michael Matthews by e-mail and he's patiently answering all my questions regarding his program. The book is definitetly worth reading.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|its pretty good. it would be way better if it had the square root button. besides that it is a great calculater
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love,love,love this trilogy. Im on my final pages of book 3, and im reading slow because I dont want it to end!<br />I recommend it to all! Men and women! Cant wait for the movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season keeps up the great story lines from the past seasons with the addition of a few more. This \\"TV\\" show is SO much better than most zombie flicks on DVD and even some that make it to the big screen.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Most sophomore albums tend to not be as great as debut ones; however, this is NOT the case with Mumford and Son's Babel. This album is truly amazing especially when I can say I enjoy every song on the album!
B008YKRRH2|4.0|It's great to have all of Klemperer's EMI studio Bruckner recordings here in a budget priced box.  However, EMI elected to not update their remastering of Symphonies No.5 (1990 remaster), 8 and 9 (1991 remasters), even though EMI did reissue these Bruckner performances in 24 bit remasterings in their pricey HQ series.  It is disappointing that EMI saw fit to give us these 20+ year old remasters instead.....especially since EMI/France saw fit to offer 24 bit remasters in its' recent budget box of Klemperer's Mahler, which reviewers have said is identical to the EMI HQ issues.  Again, with EMI, we have a glass half-full.  Thus, I can't see fit to give this set more than a 4-star rating.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|HOW did I not hear about this series sooner? A friend suggested I buy the Omnibus edition. I swear, I couldn't stop reading. Read them all in 3 days. Lost tons of sleep, but majorly worth it. Fresh story...believable characters that I actually cared about. Love how the characters flowed from one story to the next. I DO have a complaint though (Sorry.) I REALLY wanted to find out what happened to the kids. So, peeked at Wool 6 and.....WHAT??? a Prequel! I'm a mom....what happens to those kids???????<br /><br />I appreciate the story line of Wool 6, about how it started, but, please, release a continuation of the origional story line soon. Pretty please? With a nice under-ripe tomato on top???<br /><br />I'm recommending this to everyone I know. You won't be disappointed either.
B008YKRRIQ|4.0|The bulk of these performances appeared in the 1999 remastered Klemperer  \\"legacy\\" series.  A couple are from 2011 DSD issues.  A few recordings, though, are from 1991 issues that have not been remastered. That being said, this set is a great value since most of those 1999 legacy issues are out-of-print or available at ridiculous inflated prices on the used market. However, the decision by EMI to not give us new remasters of the few 1991 remasters in the set causes me to give the overall set a qualified recommendation.
0525952926|3.0|Winter of the World:  Book Two of Center Trilogy is a good Cliffs Notes version of events leading up to and during WW II.  The characters in the book are a bit over the top but are developed well and kept me interested throughout.  I tended to read the book prior to going to bed and it helped me fall a sleep.  Ken Follett is one of my favorite writers and has been since his early novel, Eye of the Needle. If your a fan you won't be disappointed.
B008YKRRI6|5.0|Most of these recordings have appeared in either the recent EMI Great Performances series or the 1999 remastered Legacy series. Only one disc in this set is from 21 year remasters.  This is a collection for Klemperer advocates who do not already have these recordings, or those who simply want everything in one convenient box.  In any case, this set is a fine value and an important document of a great artist.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|Movie is of course wonderful. Only problem is extra features for BD Live doesn't work. Not sure if it's the disk or our player. Would love to use the BD Live feature.
B007K7IA76|4.0|great album - theres no need of writing about it..the only bad thing is the thin nylon packaging that it came in...instantly got torn in the edges..recommend ordering a blank vynil package for it..
B004AQR24W|2.0|The first half of the movie attempt to create some believable story, while the latter end comes close to giving you epileptic seizures with its mind-dumbing action. A few action sequences are well done, and a few random one-liners will make you chuckle, but that's all there is to this movie--just a time filler.
0525952926|5.0|I ordered this book as a gift for my son who will be home from Japan for a visit in Janauary.  I am very pleased with the condition of the book, definitely gift quality.  I also plan on reading the book prior to his visit since we both really liked Fall of the Giants.  I will need to make sure that I handle the book carefully so it stays in gift givign condition.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  A great tale of a father's courage and dedication to his daughter.  Being a dog lover, it was hard to this book put down. A very nice ending.
B008OOYALE|5.0|so glad i downloaded this game its amazing. so wonderfully designed. and great graphics. my son loves this game as well.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|There was a lot of build up to the release of this album...The first 5 songs are above par of such Cd's as Rock in a Hard Place and Just Push Play...The rest of the record is totally forgettable and lacks any real melody.  Sorry guys...Perhaps you should have stuck just touring around milking your old hits.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like both the hour glass timer and the alarm clock.  They are very effective at waking me up. I especially like how the volume gradually gets louder and louder.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is a great story about life and the world in which we live. Koontz has a magnificent way with words and ties together the elements of his novels exquisitely.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|If DKG wrote the phone book I'd read it...her research is impeccable and the end product makes this or any topic she writes about endlessly fascinting.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|I read a newspaper review many months ago and thought that looked interesting.  I am still plodding through it - God knows why - and I hate every page.  I could care less about anyone in it.  It's boring! A very bad purchase.  My final word: Rubbish.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I was pulled into the plot, hungry to know where it would take me next, I thought I knew the ending but it twisted and ripped my desire for a happy ending apart..just like real life I guess! Not the best literature I've ever read but enticing, engaging and very enjoyable to read
B004LP3AYI|4.0|As soon as I finished book two, I realized that I had to discover what happens next. I have already purchased the next book in this series. Great and fun reading.
B002M87W2W|5.0|Meet Me In St. Louis is an excellent musical.  I purchased the two-disk set from Amazon, and we have enjoyed the movie.  The audio and video reproduction is excellent.  As for Instant Video (or whatever it is called), I did not want.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Buy this Book if you want to know the future!  Mr. Anderson is right in the middle of what is going on and his view on how things are going to change in the world because of the new 3D technologies is right on as far as I am concerned.  He lays it out step by step on what and how things are going to happen in manufacturing in the world in the next 5 years and into the future.  If you want to know what your kids and grandkids are going to be influenced by in the coming years you need to read this book and his other one \\"The Long Tail\\"
B008RV5K5E|2.0|When I bought this I didn't actually read the product description very well.  I didn't catch it was a animated version of the Dark Night. I had not actually seen the actually movie yet. When I went to view this I was shock it was animated. I think the product description could have been better written. Because I thought I was buying the movie that released this year in the theaters. I story line I felt was a little weak. Although I usually enjoy the comics this was not one of my favorites.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|unable to install app after purchase<br />. will no install from the cloud;did complete purchase though- have attempted installation for over 1 hour with no success
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have read Book One, Two and Three. My brother in law and son in law recommended the series. I was reluctant to read any kind of Middle Ages Fantasy. Once I started I could not put Book One down.The same for 2 and 3. Great characters, action, complexities,  and humor. I will read Book 4 and 5.
B000QUUD60|5.0|\\"Elvis: That's the Way It Is\\" is a great DVD for who wants to know Elvis Presley better. It is phenomenal.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat! And, as usual, we all go to Law School when we read John Grisham's books. I think I am ready for the bar exam.
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Gran Torino improves upon the DVD version.  Lines are crisper, and everything is more detailed.  The movie has something of a late summer, old timey yellow tint to it in some scenes, and a washed out look in others, both of which I believe was intentional to give it a feeling of age.  This is in keeping with the main character.  Black tones are deep, providing good contrast.  A number of indoor scenes appear to have been shot in natural light, which adds to the realism.  The sound, while clear, was low--I had to turn up on the volume on my system quite high before it sounded normal.  Despite this quibble, the blu-ray version is to be preferred over the DVD version, and is worth upgrading to.
B0026IUXO2|1.0|Just plain horrible! Not history at all, just bad twisted hollywood all the way! I want my money and my time back!
B001S86J1C|3.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off is an improvement upon the DVD.  Nicks, scratches, dirt and other \\"artifacts\\" have been removed.  The resolution is significantly improved.  The dialogue is clear, although a bit soft--I had to crank up the volume on my system in order to hear it.  The music sounded great, however.  There are some scenes that are dark, particularly in Ferris' bedroom early in the movie, but they were dark in the DVD too.  There is also some noticeable film grain in some interior scenes, although the outside scenes look great.  On the whole, the blu-ray version is better than the DVD.  If you are a fan of this movie, it is worth upgrading.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|downloaded this game to complete a mission for a different game and fell in love with it. i play this game everyday now. gets a little difficult at times but managable.
B0088TG252|5.0|This is a good movie worth the cost to rent. Some of the twists were obvious, others were very surprising
B000JMKTLO|5.0|True Gillian Flynn style drama of a dysfunctional family and a murder mystery. Was an interesting read, one of her better books that I have read.
B008MM9630|3.0|Wish there was an option of starting over....or allowing different players<br />. Very nice graphics and storyline. I'd rather pay more for a game though than be bombarded with the &quot;need&quot; to spend as you play. This would be a five star game with just a couple more options and less sales pitch (i hate the &quot;shopping channel&quot; that's constantly changing in the upper left.....very dangerous for kids with itchy fingers!)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|okay!I don't normally leave reviews soooo when I do,it's something worth talking about.Trust!<br />You know how we all look for cool lil games on Amazon to download,well,I looked at this game in passing and wondered what was all the FUSS about.There are over 2,000 customer reviews..I laugh to myself and thought...these ppl. have lost their ever-loving minds.All you see are colorful lines and dots that you connect,together.What's the Big Deal? Well,I can tell you,what the big deal is...this darn game is ADDICTIVE,FUN,the true meaning of a brain- tease..So there,now I've said it,I'M ADDICTED TO FLOW FREE  **wipes the sweat off my forehead** Does it mean I need counseling now lol? Anywho,this is REALTALK from the tablet of Icis
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This game, Cut the rope, is a game that my granddaughter loves to play when she come to grandma's house.  I would recommend.
B001HBYH9Q|1.0|I absolutely could not stand this movie!!! The only reason I watched it all the way through was due to the false hope that it might get better - it only got more and more lame as the movie dragged on. Mediocre acting, boringly predictable plot, and no believable chemistry between Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant. Absolute waste of time, complete rubbish. -_-
B002LFPAUC|1.0|I am unable to view this movie as this system is NTSC whereing we use PAL and I am of the opinion the system should be stated BEFORE purchase as now I am stuck with a useless and expensive product.<br />Thank you.<br /><br />Peter Erler
B000VX4X2C|5.0|I have been wearing these for a month now. I love their look, their reddish brown colour, and they are comfortable. They also look rather well built and sturdy, although I've only had them for a while and I can't tell for sure. I almost feel like buying a backup pair of these shoes, because I have trouble finding shoes in my own country, Switzerland (size 14 US), and they were 240 USD here, so even with transport and taxes, they end up much cheaper sent with Amazon than in any Swiss shop.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This game has so much to it. It is a simple but interesting game where your goal is to complete a series of flips on different areas. This game is very hard to understand. You must must press the action button at the exact time to complete each level. There is no instructions so you should be very good at solving problems. Scoreloop is fun too, I can not only see highscores but I can also test my luck against my friends and random people using coins as betting chips. There are small improvements that could have been made such as better graphics and better starting up music. Do not listen to those *fake* low star reviews because this game works perfect on my Nexus 7 and is AWESOME!!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille spins a good yarn, but there is a lot of wasted pages. Corey has a lot of good sarcasm, but its overdone.
1619691809|5.0|Scott Brick does an excellent job of sounding just like the John Corey we imagine. This is a wonderful book. I disagree with the previous reviews regarding it being slow paced. I loved \\"The Lion\\" and I loved \\"The Panther\\" even more.
0385535147|2.0|I love John Grisham...he is one great storyteller. I was into this book in a heartbeat, it really grabbed me and kept me turning the pages till about 2/3-3/4 into it...then it took a turn that I surely was not expecting and all of a sudden, I was not turning the pages easily. In fact it was hard to continue reading...but I persevered and finished. I was disappointed...not particularly in the end of the book, but just the new direction that added too many pages to get to the end.<br />I see there are wonderful reviews...I may be the only person that was disappointed, but I am surely one big fan who will wait for the discounted book next time.<br /><br />Trying to edit, but the edits don't hold...let's see if this one does.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is great on multi-platform functionality, appearance, andd general efficiency. I have used it for all my class notes this term, and it has yet to disappoint me. The addition of skitch is also extremely helpful for note taking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am delighted with this App.  I was unable to use the Pinterest internet site on my Kindle Fire.  I was unable to Pin and repin.  All I could do was scroll the main page. Not sure why. When I found the Pinterest App and it worked perfectly I was excited.  I really enjoy Pinterest and have lots of fun saving recipes and getting craft ideas.  This app works great on my cell phone as well.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This film surprised me but Johnny Depp always surprises me, i like his style and i like his improv acting , he shines in this film as he does in most.<br />witty charming and very moving in places this is not your standard comedy nor is it classic horror it is  however a nice classy blend of both.<br />The gore isn't there which was pleasantly surprising, but the arcane sense of humor he throws into his character is refreshing and sexy .<br />Don't expect just simple humor, true you will find it sprinkled here and there , but over all this is a dark film about survival and the nature of the beast that lives in all of us.<br />The film blended so many pleasing elements and layers of adventure together i think you might just find what your looking for it was a pleasing film and i enjoyed it very much.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Highly overrated and predictable from the beginning. SCENARIOS STOLEN from recent crimes.  No imagination at all. Save your money, this one is a dud.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This gritty and surreal film was surprising , i didn't expect a great deal when i read the reviews i watched it with an open mind and was very surprised to find a nice dialog and very nice exciting pace.<br />Don't expect Interview with a vampire or anything of the sort , it is different and its not what your expecting.<br />witty charming and fast paced in places it leaves you drawing parallels throughout the entire film.<br />A bit slow in places and a bit groggy in others but over all a nice little film.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This series keeps you wanting more! It's never a dull moment with lots of twist and turns. It's majorly based off of a motor cycle club who lead members fight rival clubs and fight each other along with each of their own personal struggles.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. I can't get enough of it. Gives me so many ideas for the future and lots of meals.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|There have been so many variations of this game that date back to the 80's.<br />For some reason, it doesn't get old. Any limitations come from your device and not the game. At least in my experience. Great game.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This is a typical Wes Anderson film, which means I like it.  If you don't care for off-beat films and off-beat humor, this one is not for you.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I really like how you can swipe to get forecast hours later in the day.<br />There is a nice calendar mode. They even have videos of news weather meteorology reports. I usually don't like spending this much for an app so I'm happy to report that it went beyond my expectations.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can spend all day having fun.  Take a few minutes or a few hours, this game is a classic.
B00634GHJA|3.0|When this app works, it's golden. Problem is, it doesn't always work. Not sure if the problem is coming from the computer browser or the app. Comes in handy if you don't have your sync cable to transfer photos that way.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|THis ia so amazing.  I love the family and its just exciting to watch.  It really is hard not to keep going to the next.  We are on season four already and I wish we had season five.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was very well written.  Enjoyed that there were two heroines. Have recommened this book to all of my female friends.
B004KBSQOW|3.0|I love this CD it reaches my soul. When I listen to it I feel calm and relaxed. I recommend this to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy good music and singing
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this game! its very fun and its way better then oregon settler. on this game you get to make your own village, every time you pass a level it unlocks a animal or fun building. on the animals you try to complete a family of four, the animals are all from basically the third movie in the series of ice age. on the friends map you can add friends and find Scrat (the saber toothed squirrel) in their village. I would recommend this to anybody at any age and it really keeps you entertained!
1469984202|5.0|I'm a bit intimidated by the other fine and detailed reviews, but felt compelled to add my opinion for this truly fantastic author.  There are so many times you purchase a book with high hopes, only to be terribly disappointed, not the case with \\"Wool\\" series.  Mr Hugh Howey, thank you for an amazing story that sucked me in immediately (no wadding through 50-100 pages to hopefully get a connection) and submerged me the silo world. I'm on to Wool 6 and will wait, because I HAVE to, for more.  You made Sandy the horrid hurricane endurable.  Thank you again.<br /><br /> Well, just finished the sixth installment and once again I was not disappointed, Hugh Howey answered a lot of questions and left me want more.  I tend to like to buy series books when they are finished so I can power through to the conclusion, I guess I'll just have to wait. But this could be a good thing because now I can possibly get my chores done instead of sitting and reading for hour upon hour.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in you allows the reader a modest look into Gideon's life and the shadows that haunt his dreams. The seperation at the end broke my heart for Eva and the story ending had me wanting more.  Looking forward for the final chapter of this romance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED ALL THREE BOOKS. AWESOME STORY LINE AND GREAT LOVE STORY. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. WISH THERE WAS A CONTINUATION.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|On Celebration: The Video Collection there are both pros and cons. The pros being that this video collection includes music videos there have never ever appeared on any other Madonna video compilation so far and also gives us a reminder that Madonna is not only a music artist, but visual artist as well. The cons being that there are 12 of Madonna's music videos that are not included on this compilation, which are \\"Everybody\\", \\"American Life\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Causing a Commotion\\", \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\", \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\", \\"Dear Jessie\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\".
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This is a fun read, with an interesting back story.  A man, living in a nursing home, on his 100th birthday, decides to climb out his window and have an adventure.  He is soon being chased by criminals who want their money back, which was in a suitcase he picked up.  The story goes back and forth between present time, and his being chased by criminals and the police and newspaper people, who think he's been kidnapped, to early in his life and the many experiences he had with some of the great and infamous leaders of our time, including Stalin and Harry S. Truman.  It gives you two pictures of a man - see him as the old man or as the adventurous and very lucky man who lived an incredible life.  It's an unusual storyline.  Very enjoyable.  The cast of characters is imaginative and funny and add texture to the story.
B000002LND|4.0|The Immaculate Collection is the first compilation album that Madonna released and its great. It includes most of the singles released from her albums Madonna, Like a Virgin, True Blue and Like a Prayer. It even includes two new songs: \\"Justify My Love\\" (a song that I consider to be an album preview for Erotica) and \\"Rescue Me\\" and the song from Vision Quest, \\"Crazy For You\\". Also, the tracks \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Like a Prayer\\", \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Vogue\\" have alternate openings that I must say are way better than their original ones.<br /><br />Track listing:<br />1. \\"Holiday\\"<br />2. \\"Lucky Star\\"<br />3. \\"Borderline\\"<br />4. \\"Like a Virgin\\"<br />5. \\"Material Girl\\"<br />6. \\"Crazy For You\\"<br />7. \\"Into the Groove\\"<br />8. \\"Live to Tell\\"<br />9. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\"<br />10. \\"Open Your Heart\\"<br />11. \\"La Isla Bonita\\"<br />12. \\"Like a Prayer\\"<br />13. \\"Express Yourself\\"<br />14. \\"Cherish\\"<br />15. \\"Vogue\\"<br />16. \\"Justify My Love\\"<br />17. \\"Rescue Me\\"<br /><br />Overall, it's a great album, but if I were to change one thing, I would be excluding \\"Borderline\\" and replacing it with \\"Everybody\\" simply because I think it's a better track and it also helped Madonna begin her singing career.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a riveting tale by one of the people that killed Bin Laden.  Not some clown that sat in a \\"WAR ROOM\\" and claimed credit.  This guy had a lot of his \\"skin in the game\\". It lays bare the political lies by the State Department and the White House, that Pakistan is our Allie.  This is a 'must read' for people that don't drink the Cool-Aid and don't believe because it is in the main stream media that it must be so.<br /><br />I read it in about 20 hours and still had time for normal retired life activities, like going to the gym and tending to house hold chores.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, believe it!
B002HNA95E|4.0|It's time to celebrate and what better way to than to listen to a majority of Madonna's greatest hits. This is so far the best Madonna compilation album ever to surface. It's features 37 of Madonna's hit singles divided into 2 discs and the discs not only includes songs that have previously been included on a Madonna compilation album, but also includes some that weren't included and two new songs: \\"Revolver\\" (featuring Lil' Wayne) and \\"Celebration\\". Here are the tracks:<br />Disc 1<br />1. \\"Hung Up\\"<br />2. \\"Music\\"<br />3. \\"Vogue\\"<br />4. \\"4 Minutes\\" (featuring Justin Timberlake and Timbaland)<br />5. \\"Holiday\\"<br />6. \\"Everybody\\"<br />7. \\"Like a Virgin\\"<br />8. \\"Into the Groove\\"<br />9. \\"Like a Prayer\\"<br />10. \\"Ray of Light\\"<br />11. \\"Sorry\\"<br />12. \\"Express Yourself\\"<br />13. \\"Open Your Heart\\"<br />14. \\"Borderline\\"<br />15. \\"Secret\\"<br />16. \\"Erotica\\"<br />17. \\"Justify My Love\\"<br />18. \\"Revolver\\" (featuring Lil' Wayne)<br /><br />Disc 2<br />1. \\"Dress You Up\\"<br />2. \\"Material Girl\\"<br />3. \\"La Isla Bonita\\"<br />4. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\"<br />5. \\"Lucky Star\\"<br />6. \\"Burning Up\\"<br />7. \\"Crazy For You\\"<br />8. \\"Who's That Girl\\"<br />9. \\"Frozen\\"<br />10. \\"Miles Away\\"<br />11. \\"Take a Bow\\"<br />12. \\"Live to Tell\\"<br />13. \\"Beautiful Stranger\\"<br />14. \\"Hollywood\\"<br />15. \\"Die Another Day\\"<br />16. \\"Don't Tell Me\\"<br />17. \\"Cherish\\"<br />18. \\"Celebration\\"
B009FO96ZC|5.0|This CD is even better than the previous one (Floating Point). McLaughlin's playing is brilliant. He is proof that a world class musician improves over the years when he/she remains dedicated, disciplined and driven. The exceptional compositions range in dynamics and intensity allowing each of the members to shine and stretch out. I highly recommend this CD.
0765365278|5.0|So amazing...Devoured this book in about a week...Had to force myself to put it down at night so I could get enough sleep...Enough said
B0090EJR1K|2.0|I laughed, but I know this could have been better.  Hard to believe, but I kind of felt like they \\"pulled some punches.\\"  Was hoping for more of a Borat style performance.
0880796863|5.0|I was very satisfied everythingcame earlier then expected ans price was great ty amazon me being a card reader  i wanted to use a original tarot deck andnow i have it in my collection i recomend this to all beginera and masters of the tarot
0425264351|3.0|Although I somewhat enjoyed the book I kept finding myself annoyed with all the \\"Shrugging\\" and \\"Right, ok?'s?\\"  I just got the visual of everyone shrugging at each other all the time.  Very annoying, IMO.<br /><br />I hope Child stops that in his later books.  If not, I'll stop reading them.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars is tbe best mix of two games put together. It offers that angry birds game play, but a Star Wars feel. Great Game!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a basic alarm clock that works like a basic alarm clock should. Easy to use with clear functions like snooze and an alarm that gets louder if you don't dismiss it. I use it all the time for coloring my hair or cooking - just not at the same time.
B000OV85AW|1.0|The movie left a lot to be desired. It does not stick to the original book. The acting was just OK left a lot to be desired.
B00001QEE5|5.0|Peter Pan is an uplifting fantasy. It portrays the desire of children to fly, have a magical friend, and travel to a world of adventure. Its a simple story with moral lessons. The biggest aftereffect is that it stimulates a child's imagination.<br /><br />Disney brings to life the classic children's story. After watching the movie all the way through I turned on the audio commentary by Roy Disney while watching it a second time. The background information on the film is fascinating and gives you an entirely different perspective. Walt Disney and those who provided the voices also have interesting things to say.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Pwerful, riveting! It had me on the edge of my seat! To think this may be going on in today's day and age is shocking!
B004P1JEWU|5.0|The 3rd in the series and the books just keep getting better. The story line keeps you enthralled from start to finish
B007IXWKUK|2.0|There is a bit of a story line in this series, just a bit. I started reading it because of all the hooplah about the first book. I laughed when I heard it referred to as \\"Mommy porn\\".  Somehow though, that seems to fit.  Just a bit more explicit than Harleqin romances in my opinion.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|This game is really fun overall. It is an interactive story-line with multiple puzzles spaced through and many options to choose what you want to say and do. My only problem is the game makes you play through it multiple times if you want to get the full story-line but at least it gives you a fast-forward button for content you've already done. You also can only do 3-4 puzzles in a single play-through with there being 9 overall so I guess it adds variety to multiple play-throughs.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The movie is tons of fun, it could be better though plotwise. But regardless, it kept me glued to the TV and the 3D was pretty amazing. If you want to show off the 3D blu ray, by all means get it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Cool way to kill time!! Just wish you didn't run out of coins so fast!!! But still fun and a good waste of time!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When I lost my original cable, quick shipping help me get my kindle back up and running. The cable was as described
B008KE3960|5.0|Great spin on the tower defenestration's genre.  You can get a lot of free play without downloading extra maps.  If you chose to buy extras, they are reasonably priced.
034580404X|5.0|If you love a kinky, romantic, and addicting read, than this is the book for you! Read all 3 in a week.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this games is so awesome because I had it on my ipod and my ipod broke and I missed it :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so glad I was instroduced to Pinterest! It has helped me with teaching ideas,  cooking, wedding ideas,  and so much more!
B0086700CM|5.0|great graphics and totally addicting. just wish they had a speed control for us less coordinated. highly recommend this game.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Learned of this book on NPR and so far they were right: A clever novel. I am only a quarter of the way through but I am enjoying it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I heard the story about Rodriguez and saw the documentary, \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\", so was curious about the music.  I immediately loved every song on this and two other albums I purchased.  The words are precious and deep.  It is too bad that they didn't catch on in the USA long ago encouraging him to produce more.  Sometimes I go out on a limb and buy something unusual and listen to it once.  I listen to this daily.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I totally loved this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes romance novels.  This was a great page turner, and I had a hard time putting it down.  And couldn't wait until I got the next book!  Loved it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love the whole concept & enjoy the interaction that the cast have. really like the idea of the writers around the card table. Keep it going.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Book was great.  Non-military will have some difficulties with understanding.  Loved it.  Praise to everyone involved especially the CIA for finding him
B0053JJLLC|1.0|This story line has been done numerous times. It's an ok read but not at all what I was looking for.
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|The story of MONEYBALL, the collision of quantitative information vs. the intuition of long-time baseball scouts, was interesting but Brad Pitt was absolutely flat in his performance as Billy Beane.  Who told the man he could act?  The extent of his acting was limited to tossing his too-long hair (a toupee?) around.  His lines were okay but would have been better if delivered by a decent actor.  And Jonah Hill was no better.  Was he actually told to show no emotion?  If so, he succeeded.  He didn't show nervousness (when he had to fire a person), joy (when his theory was validated) or surprise (when Billy hires him).  Frankly, he was a blivet.  A round face and glasses do not a character make.<br /><br />I was shocked to read that Aaron Sorkin had co-written the script.  I've been a fan of his since SPORTS NITE and this was just not up to his usual standard.  WAAAY too many flashbacks to Billy's career, foolish use of Billy's 12 year old daughter and an irrelevant scene with his ex-wife and her husband......all of which lengthened the movie while adding nothing.<br /><br />It may have seemed a good idea to use real people to play themselves but they couldn't act.  Every time such a \\"real person\\" appeared on screen, the movie stopped dead.  Plus, it made it all too obvious that this was a mish-mash of documentary and fiction - to neither's credit.<br /><br />Too bad that I can't recommend it because there were aspects that were fascinating.  Unfortunately, the execution was just poor.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|Amazing, griping read. I could not put this book down, I found it so emotional in places I cried. Victoria was an amazing character whom I grew to love more and more. Fantastic
B008BM9L72|5.0|I simply love this collection, its a collect-able. The plot is good, more than anything i love the conversations between Anastasia and Christian.at the moment am living, thinking Fifty Shades.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|The book is a great follow up to The Secret.  The Magic provides better details and answers the question Why.  I really enjoyed reading this book and I will definitely recommend it to my friends.
0142421375|1.0|Don't be fooled by the famous author, this book is a miserable excuse for a story.  Not so much unbelievable as a waste of time.  We never cared a wit for the characters, there was no buildup, no climax, and we could not have been more indifferent about the resolution.  Some girl is believed kidnapped but turns out she was just with her father.  Yawn.  It was really rather painful to read.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This has all the elements of fun that Angry Birds has and more. Some of the levels are very difficult and require a lot of work and can be rather frustrating. If this was for the younger set (say ages 10 or below)  it may prove too difficult. It requires a knowledge of engineering on the dynamics of different materials and how they will react in order to solve several of the episodes (e.g. the wooden boxes are lighter and will allow for higher speeds, but won't allow for as much punishment. On the other hand the metal boxes will contain the explosive power of the TNT to a far larger degree then the wooden boxes thus allowing a finer control and direction for the blast when needed.<br /><br />Some have complained about lack of instructions but in reality the pictorial \\"idea book\\" (it's the one next to the \\"look button\\" ) has all you need. The rest is really up the person doing the building because any one objects effect on the whole contraption WILL change by movement of it to another square. E.G.  the wooden wheels can be used for balancing the contraption, or unbalancing it to make it flip where it needs to, in order to accomplish the mission.<br /><br />The one Secret which isn't t really a secret but does affect how you play the game, is that the levels aren't one all completed by building only contraption. EG in scenario you can not reach the star box and make it to the end to grab the piece of plan within the time frame they give youyhe plan  to achieve the three stars.  It is one or the other. Which is fine because you build one contraption to reach the star and then plan (but not in the time slot they lay out): but then you rebuild the contraption for speed and don't worry about the star. Once you have grabbed the star in the first run through it stays grabbed for the purpose of getting three stars and you can focus on achieving the other stars without having to do all three at one time.<br /><br />One thing unlike the birds: once you launch the contraption you have to keep interacting and can have up to 5 separate additional actions that will change the characteristics of the contraptions while its still moving. This is where the frustration level can reach up pretty high even for an old engineer like me. It requires precision timing and coordination to achieve any results and some times a complete change of thought as well. And you don't have to use all the pieces all the time. More pieces mean more weight and can be slower or faster depending on where you put them and when you use them.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, Grisham can develop an intriguing story, although in this instance it was not entirely about the legal profession.  The character development had much in the way of complexity, and the ending was deceptively unusual, so that I had to chuckle a bit at the irony.
B008TTPQXA|2.0|When I made my order I was expecting a longer and more detailed description of the experiences lived by the author in Heaven or the other dimension (called it as you like). I was disappointed because this corresponded to the smallest part of the book. Finally the reference to Eterea and how you can improve your spiritual abilities, paying of course, made the whole story sound like a piece of advertising aimed at promoting that Association (or whatever).
B003XQ2VOG|5.0|This is a 4 disk set in a sturdy case and functional slip case.  The quality of the dvds is excellent.  The reproduction quality varies a bit from feature to feature, but is excellent overall.  The Lost World from 1960 is (by today's standards) a rather mundane dinoflick.  It is my least favorite of the 4. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961) is the classic film which spawned the TV series.  It has an excellent cast, a good script, and great sets and effects. I was going to buy it as a stand alone till I saw this set.  Fantastic Voyage (1966) has been one of my favoites since it came out.  The story, cast and special effects are excellent.  It's a tale of espionage set inside a living body with science and technology oozing out of every pore.  When I saw this title in the pack, I was sold.  The Towering Inferno (1974) is one of the bevy of disaster movies which exploded in the seventies.  An excellent cast and script keep the suspense moving.  It's an adventure, it's a mini-soap opera, it's hunky firefighters and society ladies, and it is excellent.  Some features include trailers or other goodies.  Overall, it's hard to beat this set either in quality or in price.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|A 'mario' type game that is easier to manage yet very challenging.  I didn't think I would ever get through it, but I still go back and play again and again.  Hard to put down once started.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great work from John Grisham.  If you are a Grisham fan, it is a must read.<br />He keeps you thinking and weaves a great story.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|I haven't been a runner for a long long time, but I want to get back to it. Hitting 50. Am I too old? Will my body be able for it? I have no desire to run a 50 miler, just a few. This book has given me a lot of confidence and inspiration. Even if I never run again it was a great uplifting read.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is a perfect first doll for my little great-granddaughter!  She's a good size for a little girl to carry and cuddle for many years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great and a continuation of the other books.<br /><br />You will love reading this book and all the others
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Rakateer is totally emersing.  Of course, it couldn't really happen, but it sounds plausible enough to continue through.  Malcolm isn't all that likable, but I found myself rooting for him right from the beginning.  It is  a thoroughly enjoyable read.  Of course it's not a real legal case -- folks looking for that should go to the library and read some cases.  But if you like to be entertained with a page turner, I recommend this heartily.  That's two good ones in a row for John Grisham.
031618201X|5.0|I have long been a fan of graphic novels and, to a lesser degree, manga. So when I heard that Soulless would be produced as a manga, I was intrigued.<br /><br />After getting my hands on a copy, I can say I'm impressed, both by how well the text translated over to manga and by the art. To say REM's work is incredible is an understatement. The expressiveness of the characters, the Victorian setting and costumes, the backgrounds - absolutely breathtaking. Condensing the book into a manga couldn't have been easy, but the volume easily tells the story without leaving out anything vitally important.<br /><br />Manga wouldn't be manga with sexual overtones, but I think REM kept it extremely tasteful and in line with Carriger's books.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to any manga or Parasol Protectorate fan. It's top notch!
0451232852|5.0|I have read and enjoyed many of Ken Follett's books, and particularly enjoyed his historical saga Pillars of the Earth.  When I heard about Fall of Giants, the first of three books, I couldn't wait.  I did enjoy reading it on the IPad ICloud reader vice hefting the heavy tome, but my favorite part was the story, the history, and the many fully dimensional characters.  A great hunk of history told in rich story style.  I loved each person, even those with faulty views.  I am thoroughly committed to reading the entire trilogy and enjoying every minute.  For anyone not sure they want to take the time to read such a larg work, please trust me -- it won take as long as you think, and you'll be sad when there's only a few pages left.
B005VPRG10|4.0|I purchased the x-wing fighter for my 4.5 year old son and he loved it, but he needed a \\"bad guy\\", so I grabbed this TIE fighter.<br /><br />The build was very easy.  My son did almost all of it by himself with little direction from me.  It is relatively sturdy and withstands his games quite well.  It is large and is a good match to the x-wing.  In my opinion, the glass of the cockpit is too dark and you can't see the pilot.  Other than that, no complaints.
0385340540|4.0|I love John Grisham and have read each one of his books.  Like other reviewers, there have been a few lately that  let me down a little.  I bought and read the Broker when it first came out, but  I had occasion to find something to read the other day during a snowstorm and chose thr Broker off my shelf.  Not disappointed. This was not a fast moving story, but it was one you wanted to finish.  I cared about Joel Backman, and I cared about his son.  I wanted to warn him from time to time, but of course, he is bright and did pretty well for himself.  It was a a very good read -- again.  Recommended.
B007R68DOA|5.0|Best Ozzy album ever, Randy's best work to say the least. This is the album the set the precedence for all metal guitarists to come
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Nice variety of styles. The title of the album seems to be very appropriate. The band sounds like they are having a lot of fun on this album.  It evokes the spirit that seems to have been aimed for in Honkin on Bobo. The album feels familiar after a first listen, but remains fresh.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|First, the thought of yet another version of the Well Tempered Clavier in my collection seemed not merely unnecessary, but truly pointless. But how wrong I was, and how delighted I am with this magnificent performance and production. It is clear, crisp, and unslurred by the artificial colorings of the pedal. The musicality of it comes through definitively and liltingly. It stands head and shoulders above the other recordings I have. I will never come to the point, as Andras Schiff has, of being able to play this set of four CDs from memory(!), but I will definitely be listening to it far more than the others I have. A lifetime of practicing has paid off stunningly for Andras Schiff. This is a real accomplishment, and makes this precious achievement of Bach's all the more eternal. His feet may be flat on the floor, but his fingers are dancing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free Flow is a fast and easy game for the most, with a few tough puzzles that really make you think.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Certain puzzles will not download... I do not know what is wrong with the app now. Please fix, this is very frustrating.
0525952926|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I have his others. History becomes more alive as you follow the characters through the timeline. I completed the book in one week and passed it on to my husband, who is a history buff. Can't wait for the next one.
B004INHTK4|5.0|I loved this book it was amazing. It engaged me so much. It changed the way I thought. Must read
B00631VJIC|4.0|Song selections were great. Really enjoyed them all and am thinking of ordering more. Definitely, a two thumbs up purchase.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|There are plenty of places to get investment advice and lifestyle advice. This book is a good read for the basic advice it gives.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game can be fun.  But for some reason you only get to play for about 20 seconds and then it freezes up and you have to force close it.  Complete waste of time.
B008B92U32|5.0|Awesome app but it needs to come with sample pictures like fwarp. Other then that it's great. Please make sample pictures!
B0072OFM28|5.0|Better than first season and still a great storyline.Very entertaining in every way wish they would not stop at four.
B008M34INW|5.0|Mel Gibson takes us on a wild romp through the Mexican prison/drug culture -- with side trips into America's corporate gambling culture -- that is exhilerating from beginning to end.  If you can stand brutality and profanity, you will get a strong dose of intelligent heroism as Gibson rolls out another fast-paced, humorous, and heart-pounding adventure.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Has not come in yet but if it is anything  like the first two seasons I'm sure I will love it!
1451695195|3.0|As a Buddhist, I found it interesting that in Dr. Eben's heaven, he doesn't mention seeing Jesus, Buddha, or Muhammed.  I gave this book three stars because Dr. Eben doesn't tell us a whole lot about his near-death experience.  He mostly talks about his family history and illness, while repeating snippets of his experiences while in a coma.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Love it good watch! WILL ORDER THE 4 SEASONS I loved the action special effects and the storyline. All the actors were good.
0316223239|4.0|I was skeptical about this book, only because so many &#34;serious&#34; novelists seem to delight in gut-wrenching endings, and this one seemed ripe for such an ending. After I was assured by a friend that I wouldn't be crying at the end, I gave it a try. There were moments when it seemed to drag a bit for my taste, but some of those moments, when they were locked together in the room, may have been intended to have that effect to bring us into the monotony of their confined lives. Even the parts that were a little slow were never terribly so, though, and the story would move on and was still enjoyable. I read this book in one day in two sittings, so the slow parts weren't THAT slow. It's a dreadful premise that is made tolerable because of the voice of the five-year-old narrator. He and Ma are beautifully complex and developed, and I think the author did a wonderful job of imagining the effects of imprisonment and freedom on both of them. The premise could just as well have been a thriller, but this one is a character novel, not a thriller, and much more satisfying for it. I will definitely look for more by this author. Her ability to understand her characters and show them on the page in formidable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i thought the book was a total page turner until i got to the end.  was really disappointed.  It's obviously a personal opinion, so i would still recommend the book to people.  however, i really thought the ending should have gone in a different direction.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The movie was alright thought it was going to be better. And in 3D the movie was pretty dark! Thats about it.
B001QWBM62|4.0|As an audio engineer, I've been asked more than once to record a band's set. Problem is, it wasn't something I've ever really wanted to be bothered doing. Nothing really sounded great, and to get good sound usually was more hassle than what you're getting paid.<br /><br />The ZOOM H4N makes it easy. Either set it, hit record, and forget it, or take a feed from the board and use the onboard stereo mics. Great sound, built in compression, and the easy to use interface makes you look like the hero who can record anything.<br /><br />However, this unit really shines on location for film. Plug a boom mic in (the ZOOM delivers phantom power) and you're saving money from having to hire a boom operator. I like to use all four channels and use the onboard digital mixer to get great room tone and the actor all at the same time. You can mix the individual mic level and the input level together, add compression if needed (which is more often than not, especially outdoors).<br />My biggest complaint is that there is no handy belt clip.
0316228532|4.0|It is true that The Casual Vacancy is not Harry Potter, but then it is not meant to be. I decided to read it primarily because I love the Potter books and given the mixed reviews began it with some trepidation.<br /><br />Rowling has already proven herself capable of creating a large cast of vividly drawn characters. She again shows her ability to populate a world with many different people, although in this case the portraits are decidedly darker.<br /><br />I will admit that while there is some humor in the story, most of it addresses what I consider very serious and dark themes. I will also admit that about half way through the book I questioned whether I would really like it. However, by the time I finished it, I was not sorry that I had stuck with it.<br /><br />The ending of this novel packs an emotional punch that deeply moved me. The fates of characters that I had come to love and/or hate were heartbreaking and inspiring. All of the work that Rowling put into drawing her characters and then bringing them together in the climactic event was amazing.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I love this book, I've read it twice now and will be reading it again! On to the next book and after the next! Can't wait for the film
B0012HF5NC|5.0|great movie independence day is one of my favorite movies i have it on vhs and decided to get the dvd its funny it has plenty of suspence and all of the actors look like they fun making the movie plus they made a lot of money from box office sales as well as when it came out for home entertainment as well
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|All right, it's not as good as the 1982 classic, but it is still a good movie, with interesting effects and a story line with no surprises or nothing new to show.<br /><br />Kate Winslett did a superb acting job in her role as a scientist who is asked to drop everything and come to Antartica to help with an importantant finding there. We already know what is waiting for her there, so the plot suffers somewhat because there is no mystery to be unveiled.<br /><br />This movie is interesting because it shows what happened at the Norwegian camp before the alien escaped in the form of a dog and made it to the American base, but as the story unfolds, it is missing the drama, suspense, and tenseness that unfolded in the original movie. The alien is presented with some CGI and some traditional (low-tech) effects, which help capture the flavor of the original. I don't think that CGI was overused, as some say.<br /><br />As for my criticisms, in the 1882 version, there is a scene where the Americans are watching a videotape of the Norwegians after they found the spaceship in the ice, and then the Norwegians accidentally blew it up with thermite grenades. In the 2012 version, that didn't happen.  The spaceship was still intact, and although Kate blew up an alien inside the ship with a grenade, it apparently didn't completely destroy the ship, but only caused it to power down. So this is an example of discontinuity of plot from the original story.<br /><br />Another minor gripe is that in a major confrontation toward the end of the movie, the alien took over one of the scientists, and then morphed back into alien form.  There is a scene where the alien grabbed the lab tech and started to merge with him, making a two-faced monster. My question is why did it stay in the two-faced state?  Why didn't it morph into another state instead of staying incomplete like that?<br /><br />Despite these nitpicks, this movie was a worthy effort, and should be included in your movie library!
0785163174|3.0|To be honest this is one of the cases where I wish Amazon had a more robust rating system. I really feel this book is a solid C grade, 7 out of 10, 3.5 out of 5 stars, however you want to put it. Since I can't pick that option I have to go with the lower end of the spectrum.<br /><br />Avengers vs X-Men doesn't have the most logical premise in the world, it is after all just an excuse to see the Avengers fight the X-Men. The Phoenix is returning to Earth and no one really knows what to do about it so the Avengers decide they should attack the X-Men and kidnap a girl who is the most likely host. With the Avengers decision making being as ludicrous as it is the X-Men aren't very happy about it and conflict ensues. The fighting eventually devolves into marvel characters chasing Hope across the globe, pretty standard for an X-Men event (see Messiah Complex and Second Coming). These issues are loud and fast, you get a lot of action but not much in the way of character development. If that's your thing don't get too excited because just 5 issues in Avengers vs X-Men changes things up...well somewhat.<br /><br />Once the Phoenix finds its host you see an even bigger (but no less logical) divide come between the Avengers and the X-Men. The X-Men proceed to go about fixing the world's problems (whether the world likes it or not) and the Avengers continue with their strategy of attacking the X-Men based on nothing more than suspicion. From this point the X-Men are portrayed as the villains of the series though it could easily be argued every villainous action they take is a direct reaction to aggression brought on by the Avengers. These issues move a little slower (not much) and there are a few attempts at character development. We get a few surprises along the way but don't kid yourself, this is a non-stop action story plain and simple. As such the main area where the event shines is artistically, marvel brought along some of its biggest names and Coipel and Kubert really doa great job with the fight scenes. Aaron, Bendis, and Hickman all do well enough with their scripts; Spider-man's funny, Wolverine's grumpy, Cyclops isn't particularly likable, the writers know their characters unfortunately there isn't much story to be had over so many issues.<br /><br />The AVX issues span the length of the event and are of widely varying quality. They first issue is probably the weakest since it appears to have been done entirely for shock value (its battles are even mocked by the far more enjoyable issue 6). But overall the quality (and pacing) is fairly consistent with the rest of the event.<br /><br />In typical marvel fashion the collection department makes no effort to integrate the various \\"series\\" together. The Avengers vs X-Men issues are separated from the AVX issues and the infinite bonuses so if you want to read the stories in order, you're going to have to do the leg work on your own (marvel could have at least included a reading guide). There are also a few added bonuses at the end at least one of which is some sort of fight guide I found to be just as confusing as it looked after fully reading through it.<br /><br />I've already seen complaints the 'included' digital codes are not included, that being said mine was printed plainly on the dust jacket. Of course the code expired on 11/7 and I received my book 11/8 so technically it's not valid but the codes usually remain activated for months beyond their expiration date. As a final side note there is an add for the Marvel Augmented reality app on the last page which while I understand the purpose I found to be disturbingly tacky. Minor Ads are sometimes included at the end of trades but this is the first time I've seen it on a deluxe hardcover and it just doesn't feel the same.<br /><br />Bottom line, you don't get the depth of storytelling you'll find in Civil War but if you just want to see Super Heroes beating one another up this is your book.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this on a whim as an add-on gift, thinking it would be cute but not substantive.  My boyfriend started reading it and kept laughing, so he ended up reading almost all of it out loud to share the jokes.  Not only are the poems very well-written - not cloying or cutesy - but the humor is really cat-like - sly, seemingly innocent, utterly self-centered.  I could picture a specific cat I've known for literally every poem in the book, and usually more than one.<br /><br />Some of the funnier lines have become catch-phrases for us (\\"I said I could sit on your lap forever...Well you should have gone to the bathroom beforehand.\\" \\"If I took you to the vet, I'm make damn sure you came back with both of them.\\" \\"Why are you mispronouncing 'Georgia' as 'New York'?\\").  I've since picked up the book a couple of times and found the poems equally funny the second, third, fourth times.  Highly recommended for anyone owned by a cat, or who loves someone owned by a cat.
B003L77GRO|1.0|Amazon did a great job of getting the DVD to my door on the date promised. Excited I couldn't wait to watch these videos however after repeated delays in working properly in my XBOX I finally got the 1st and 2nd DVDs to work. I was not so lucky with the 3rd DVD. I cannot get it to play at all. I even tried another DVD player in case it was my XBOX player.<br /><br />Now I am waiting to call Amazon to see what can be done.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Must say John Grisham is moving from gripping to the predictable. The yarn about an ex-lawyer turned convict and his plot to extract revenge from the system that incarcerated him in the first place is nice and moves along at a good speed. The problem is, less than 30% of the way into the book, you tend to guess the outline of the plot and from then it is just a mental exercise in ticking off what you had figured as against what the author has plotted. Disappointing from that point of view.

B004HX4RT6|5.0|What can I say about the great game of chess that hasn't been before? It is the granddaddy of all logic games and is incredibly addicting. It is also very easy to learn and almost impossible to master.<br /><br />The Android version created by AI Factory Limited is an almost flawless transition of chess into the virtual realm. My only complaint is the little smiley face button on the main menu that lets you get other games from the developer and lack of online play. But really, those are very minor issues as the rest of the package is simply awesome.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Minimalistic graphics and sound that don't detract from the game.<br /><br />- TWO PLAYERS VS on one device! This is phenomenal!<br /><br />- Great AI at the higher difficulty levels.<br /><br />- Lots of ways to customize your playing field, you can change everything from the actual pieces to the board colors.<br /><br />- Options that will allow you see legal moves, undo moves, display coordinates, etc. If you can think it, it's probably here.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Smiley faced icon on the main menu that allows users to purchase other games from the developer. Not too terrible, but annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />- I found nothing that I can consider as \\"ugly\\" in here.<br /><br />Scores:<br />App - 5/5<br />Permissions - 5/5<br />Combined - 5/5<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This app really is a great value at $.99, and a must download as today's free app of the day. Even if you don't know how to play chess, the legal move option along with some YouTube videos will take care of that. There really is no excuse not to download and try this epic app!<br /><br />Thank you AI Factory Limited for releasing such a great game, and not loading it up with unnecessary permissions or junkware like scoreloop! I hope it does well enough to warrant constant updates, including better AI and more board/piece options!

B005LJITS0|1.0|Green Lantern had potential. It's got a rich history reaching back decades! Now already there has been an animated movie which did the story justice. There was another movie that was animated that did a good job as well. Surely with the power of Hollywood Green Lantern would be amazing! Unfortunately the problems started with the funny look suit. This was only the surface of what was wrong with this movie. This movie tried to create an epic story like The Avengers, but with only a fraction of the time. They tried to do too much, they changed too much, and it came together in a sloppy subpar movie. Much like the 1st live action Hulk movie that changed a lot, and ended up failing horribly. The only good thing are the special affects, but even that wasn't as good as it should have been, with actual constructs, such as guns or hammers, rather then laser blasts. Even the Green Lantern Corp couldn't save a movie that tries to do too much, in too little time, in a VERY convoluted plot.

B003UESJEW|1.0|There actually are some good movies made about the business world (see \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\") and even the present-day downsizing U.S. corporate world (see \\"Up In the Air\\"), but \\"The Company Men\\" is not one of them.  Far from it.  Its fundamental flaw is that its makers don't understand the real world of American business well enough to create a compelling drama about the impact a threatened, downsizing company has on its workers and their families, which is the film's goal.<br /><br />The film's main characters, besides being unappealing, are all simple stereotypes.  Ben Affleck is far too perfect and glib as a golfing, Porsche-driving yuppie who has to discover what it means to do an honest day's work with his hands.  Tommy Lee Jones, I fear, has lost it as an actor - he looks, sounds and acts very old in this film, and the fact that he gets to bed a fairly good-looking blonde boggles the mind.  The cost-cutting CEO is nothing more than an automaton who calculates exactly how many employees to axe every quarter in order to please Wall Street.  Besides being totally unappealing, none of these characters come close to being real.<br /><br />But \\"The Company Men\\" saves the most preposterous material for the ending in order to deliver a moral message: if businesspeople would just stop being greedy, they could save the most hopeless of American companies and everyone would have a good job.  This may work in Hollywood, but it doesn't work in the Rust Belt.  And speaking of being greedy, how much were the leading actors in this film paid in comparison to the make-up artists and the grips?
B007ME5BUG|5.0|i have read dozens of books on vietnam over the years & this rates as one of the best; does a great job covering the period of the viet-minh/french was & the US role in that;  a great american tragedy that we did not support ho chi minh after WWll but instead supported the french efforts to re-establish their colony in indo-china; we did not support british efforts to re-establish control in india but we did the french only because ho was a communist but he was a nationalist first & we did not get it
B003E88TKS|5.0|It's hard to imagine a better film about the post-Great Recession business world than \\"Up in the Air\\" (UITA).  What makes UITA such a wonderful film is that is recognizes that businesses are people, and it does an excellent job portraying the feelings, relationships and travails that its characters, both major and minor, go through.  It does so in a way that is compelling, intelligent, nuanced, and at times humorous, as well as touching.  It is well worth a repeat viewing, which is one of my criteria for an excellent film.<br /><br />George Clooney is perfectly cast in the lead role - it is a role that fully takes advantage of his good looks, intelligence, confidence, smooth delivery, and his ability to, at times, let his inner emotions shine through his outer shell.  Vera Farmiga doesn't have as big a role as Clooney, but she is similarly excellent as the woman who appears to be the perfect match for Clooney's character.  Anna Kendrick portrays a just-out-of-college young businessperson, and her performance accurately portrays the awkwardness and deference of her character.  There is also some excellent work done by the actors with bit parts.<br /><br />The filmmaking in UITA is top notch:  the cinematography, the settings, the background music, the plot and the overall pacing of the film all show the deft touch of experienced hands.  The storyline is believable and fully captures the viewer's attention, allowing the characters' feelings to be revealed.  Those of us in the corporate world will easily identify with many aspects of that world as portrayed in UITA.  UITA grabbed my heart and mind and took them on a ride that was both fun and enlightening, and that ultimately left me very satisfied.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|another good read from grisham; i enjoy all his books, they are enjoyable & a fast read; i did suspect what was going on & was later revealed earlier in the book than i might have expected but the story did have some different twists vs many of grishams previous book; i recommend this book as a certainly worthwhile read

159420411X|2.0|I think you will find The Black Swan a much more provocative read than this. It goes into the theory of complexity which is a much more accurate way to predict the unpredicable. I believe it also gives insight into the herd mentality that most folks fall victim to. It helped me be even more of a skeptic than I already am and I feel if more folks read it (outside of the Wall Street shark tank) it would give them insight to protect themselves from these self serving preditory a** holes.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|It doesn't seem like 25 years since Rebus first hit the pages. In the 5 years since his retirement, I've missed him. The couple of books about The Complaints Division featuring the humourless, disagreeable and teetotal Malcolm Fox have helped to fill the gap, but Standing In Another Man's Grave cleverly squares the circle. Rebus returns and comes across his old adversary Fox.<br /><br />Rebus comes out of retirement to work cold case files, but as a civilian. He has none of his previous powers as a police officer, but as may be expected, this small constraint doesn't stop him investigating in his own inimitable style. The route of the A9 links disappearances and unusually, Rebus leaves Edinburgh to follow leads all over Scotland. His beloved Saab is still going strong and other familiar characters including Big Ger and Siobhan also feature. The plot is more straightforward than many of the earlier stories and it's clear early on who's responsible for the killings. However, the book still works very well. The contrast between Fox and Rebus is stark. Fox remains sterile and disapproving whilst Rebus is almost anarchic, but human and likeable. The musical references are there, but increasingly involve a sense of mortality. Some of the most poignant moments are when Rebus reflects on the death of musicians of a similar age to himself, including John Martyn and Bert Jansch.<br /><br />The good news is that the way is left open for Rebus to return. The retirement age for Police has been raised and Rebus makes it clear he wants another stint in his old job. For me, Rebus has lost non of his old magic. He remains a highly individual but engaging character. He has a distinct style and outlook but has always managed not to become a stereotype or caricature. The narrative is still fresh and relevant; there's no sense of complacency or cashing in. It's almost as if the author, too, missed and old friend. There's life in the old dog yet and the bite's as keen as ever in this outing. Thank you Mr Rankin; I hope there's another soon!ing. Thank you Mr Rankin; I hope there's another soon!
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I haven't reviewed in years, but I wanted to weigh in as a longtime fan. I've already heard Soundgarden's 'comback' album King Animal. It's better than this Aerosmith album. Van Halen's A Different Kind of Truth is better than this Aerosmith album. But if you like Aerosmith, I guarantee you'll enjoy listening to this album. Yes, as many have already said the ballads drag this down to the bottom of the ocean. No 'Angel\\" or 'Home Tonight\\" but \\"Closer' comes 'close' ;)<br /><br />Just skip the ballads unless you're in the mood. Go right to the good stuff...the rockers. If the album was edited down, it could have been the best thing since Pump. But with iTunes, you can do that...here's my Music From Another Dimension edit:<br /><br />'Side 1'<br />1. LUV XXX<br />2. Oh Yeah<br />3. Beautiful<br />4. Out Go The Lights<br />5. Legendary Child<br /><br />'Side 2'<br />6. Street Jesus<br />7. Lover Alot<br />8. Closer<br />9. Sunny Side of Love *<br />10. Shakey Ground *<br /><br />* - Non-album bonus tracks<br /><br />I worship Joe Perry's guitar, but I've never been a fan of his lead vocals, so I didn't count in those songs. But if you can deal...those cuts are good too.

0345525558|5.0|I friend recommended this to me and so I knew there was something about it she knew I'd like.  What a story!  From beginning to end the story was captivating and unpredictable.  The main character was so well developed that you felt you were living with her and not reading about her. A story of both despair and unconditional love; a story of both hope and sorrow; a story for anyone who loves flowers and gardening.  I'm so glad I read this book, though it makes me sad that it came to an end.  I need to find more books like this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games kept me riveted through the whole book.- I felt as if I were right there experiencing everything along with the characters.

Hope it works as greatly for you.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read The Pillars of the Earth about a year ago and loved it yet I decided to hold off reading the follow-up to it. I kept seeing this series on bestseller lists so I purchased this one a couple of weeks ago. Enthralling with Follett's usual knack for hooking you on characters almost from the start. As soon as I'd finished it this past Sunday I bought book two: Winter of the World. I'm about half way through it and now will have to wait for the third installment longer than I want to. GREAT read!

0307352145|5.0|Quiet begins with the telling of the story of an introverted woman whose quiet \\"No,\\" made a profound change in the way Americans think about civil rights. Rosa Parks' one word made such an impact specifically because she was quiet, and not a fiery orator like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The point needed to be made so desperately that it inspired a woman who would rather have simply ridden the bus home in solitude to speak out and risk the attention and ire of others including the police! Ms. Cain reminds us that Rosa Parks quietly acted on her dream, just as Dr. King spread the same dream through his extroverted powers of oration. She also states that the world needs both types--the introverts who think and consider before speaking quietly, and the extroverts who speak out immediately and forcefully.<br /><br />Readers are given a history of how extroversion became the cultural ideal when an agrarian society, used to being born and spending lives in the same small space and interacting with the same people throughout a lifetime, were propelled into the industrial revolution which lured people out of their comfortable worlds into a society of many strangers. Suddenly there is a need to interact quickly with people you do not know. It seems that Dale Carnegie's method of winning people over and influencing them filled people's need to work and live in the new industrial society. (I had a great laugh over this because I still have memories of my dad practicing his Dale Carnegie in front of the mirror at home.) So, what was now needed to be successful was not necessarily only your skills, but depended much more on how you presented yourself to others. Thus began the \\"Culture of Personality,\\" our fascination with extroversion, and ridicule of introversion.<br /><br />The message of the book, and Ms. Cain's work, is that group work, team work, groupthink, open space offices/classrooms, team meetings, etc. are all things that have been pushed on Westerners as the ideal, where as working alone, private offices, quiet reflection time, and individual projects have acquired a negative connotation. However, there is a need for both people who are quick with ideas and draw their strength in numbers, and those who need to contemplate quietly alone before moving forward. Both personalities have a role to play and should be cultivated appropriately even from childhood.<br /><br />You know the feeling you get when you keep a secret because you think that putting it out there would just cause more trouble than keeping it inside; then one day you find out that this is not only just your secret, but the secret of many and that the numbers tend to dilute any negative aspects of the secret. In other words, \\"Wow, I'm not the only one. I'm validated!\\" This is what happened to me in the very first chapters of Ms. Cain's work. The message that living as an introvert in a world where the ideal is extrovert is difficult at times, yes, but doable and necessary, is a message that I desperately needed to hear!<br /><br />If you are an introvert, you may be feeling guilty--which is actually a common trait in introverts--as if there is something wrong with you that needs to change. Stop! Read this book! (I even cried in some parts, I suppose from relief from all that guilt I've harbored all my life for just wanting to be alone!) If you are an extrovert or a parent or a teacher or a boss of introverts, you also should read Quiet to remind yourself of the beautiful balance that an introverted personality can provide if not unnecessarily forced into an extroverted world.ere as working alone, private offices, quiet reflection time, and individual projects have acquired a negative connotation.

1475143389|5.0|I found the book very easy to read and understand having very little background knowledge.  There's very little extra filler in this book and I finished it in about 2 and a half days.  Overall I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great way to get informed on all aspects of getting fit.  I cannot speak for the results as I have only been doing the routines for about a week now, but I will be certain to do a follow up in a few months.  Check out Mike's other book \\"The Shredded Chef\\" that has tons of healthy recipes for all your goals whether it's cutting, bulking, or maintaining [[ASIN:1478213655 The Shredded Chef: 115 Recipes for Building Muscle, Getting Lean, and Staying Healthy (The Build Healthy Muscle Series)]].

It also explains the almost indescribable bond that forms from being in combat and faced with insurmountable odds that only those who have been through can understand. This was one of the most exciting and emotional books I have read in a very long time.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|I saw this movie while it was in theaters and I was very disappointed.  Great cast but really bad script and mediocre direction.  It tried to be a comedy but drifted somewhere between B movie melodrama and rehashed punch lines.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Just when you think you have the characters divided into protagonists and antagonists, those you sympathize with versus those you disdain, you learn a bit more about them and sentiments change. As in life, there are multiple sides to every issue and many faces to most people. This novel illumines some common social issues in a localized setting and the people (some not so common) who address these issues. Couldn't put it down!
1935597760|5.0|Yes, it was a bit harsh with the orphanage and rough childhoods the main characters had, but it was very well written and the ending actually made me cry.  Am looking forward to reading more from this author.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Wrting historical novels must be fun, but this author has gone beyond reason. His families seem to be destined to be witness and participant to everything of historical note for any or all of us who lived through those tumultuous times.His research into those historical events appears to be outstanding. When Volodya a spy meets and marries Zoya a nuclear physicist he just lost me.<br />His characters are truly any or all of us, but to be so intertwined is unbelieveable.<br />I am not at all interested in seeing his third installment. Will a Chinese and Vietnamese family join the pool of characters? I really will pass on it.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Really engaging read and was immediately drawn in by the style of writing. I only gave it 4 out 5 because I thought the chapters a bit short, but I suppose in the grand scheme of things this is a sensible ploy to move the story along because there are many characters each with their own mini storyline. I was pleased with the style of writing, Martin avoids twee  language.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next instalment.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I saw another version of this movie, but for me this version is the better of the two. If you're a Sci-Fy or Horror movie person yo should add this to your movie library collection. Amazon has good connections and deals.
B007THA4FI|4.0|In small-town western midlands of England all the men are not good looking, all the women are not resourceful and all the young-uns are not exemplary - but they are believable actors in a sordid tale of prejudice and politics.  The locale of Pagford village struggles to  overcome it's Victorian distaste for those in poverty and those of different ethnic family backgrounds. Only the ghost of a main character, Barry Fairweather, who dies of a brain aneurism in the first few paragraphs, offers any reprieve from the humorless problems and tribulations of the others left to play out the destiny of Pagford politics. Realism seems to be the reason that frequent use of the \\"F\\" word becomes common-place by  characters seeking to get attention to their difficulties. The evolving story envelopes the reader, if for no other reason than to find out how the characters can possibly overcome their state of affairs and reach a brighter future. Fortunately there is a healing ending that is also believable thanks to the careful character development of the author, J. K. Rowling.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a beautiful love story that illustrates two people from opposite sides of the track; or so they thought!! I was so drawn in that I finished this book in a day! I would recommend this to anyone whose looking for a thrilling detailed love story! I can't wait for Travis Maddox's side of the story!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I have had so much fun playing this game. I definitely recommend this game to people who love Sim City.
0394401522|5.0|Great Service and Wonderful Teaching Manual for even Experienced Cooks. Worth getting in tandem with the original - Volume 1.
1451662432|5.0|Good book. I am a former competitive bodybuilder. When I was younger I looked at Arnold as someone who inspired me. In the beginning of the book, he talked about his early days. It's funny I new everything he was talking about. I look back when I was younger and I can say I almost studied him growing up. Although I have to say I lost some respect for him years ago when I was still into bodybuilding. I am from Newport R.I. When he was shooting one of his movies in Newport years ago I remember someone from the movie came to gym I used to train at to inquire about Arnold training there. I remember the owner of the gym said no problem and showed the person the prices of working out there. It was broken down by the day the week or the month. The person stared at the owner and said Arnold doesn't pay. The owner of the gym politely said \\"well Arnold doesn't work out here then\\". I remember all of us talking back then about here is this guy who is a millionaire and he thinks he should get everything in life for free. In the book he talks about his steroid use. I believe he said steroids added about ten pounds of water weight to him and kind of brushed them off. He is not telling the truth as to the amount of steroids he used. All bodybuilders at that level do an amazing amount of drugs to look that way. I'm not saying this to belittle any competitive bodybuilder, I'm just stating the facts. As to his movie career, It's interesting how things fell into his lap. Other people work at there craft for years and never achieve his success. He is a hard working and motivated person. When he makes a movie he does go over the top to promote it. He was always very political. He is a republican and he's proud of that. I am from Rhode Island so obviously I'm not a republican (ha,ha,just kidding). I do respect his political views. He admits he is more in the middle and that's where people should be. I say this because I'm writing this two days after the presidential election and look whathappened to those on the far right. Towards the end of the book he talks about when he was at some republican affair and he was talking about how the republican party should be governing from the middle and investing infrastructure. He only got a mild applause. Then governor Rick Perry got up and said infrastructure projects are a waste of tax payer money and the crowd went wild with applause. Arnold seems to have a good attitude about politics, almost a commonsense approach to it. At the end of the book I am left with a feeling sorrow for his wife. Here is a person who is beautiful and intelligent. A good mother to his children. I hope he understands what he had. If you like him or hate him the book is a good read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Some people told me this book wasn't as good as the first but I found myself on the edge of my seat!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Rovio does it again. This is an absurd game where-in you have to build contraptions to reach a level's goal. You construct your contraptions with ballons, fans, carbonated soda bottles, motors and airplane wings and rudders and ballast bags. The game, like Angry Birds, is physics-based. Lots of fun at a cheap price.
B003Y58CKS|4.0|Music, sets and costumes were great. I loved it. This is my second recording of this opera; both are excellent.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham's novels have gotten a bit tedious over the last couple of years.  Although I still enjoy them, I've been less enthused about reading them and have found them more plodding.  This one got me back to not wanting to put it down.  He's back to some fun story-telling.  It's light, but a good read.  I enjoyed it!
0321898648|5.0|I had the first Aperture 3 Pro Series training book and I thought it was incredibly thorough. Sometime more thorough than a hobby photographer really needs, but perfect for anyone hoping to gain a very strong understanding of Aperture. The book was designed as a class and not a reference guide so the best way to use it was to read the chapters in order and go through the accompanying examples so that you could not only read about the features, but also test them out and see exactly how they should affect the picture you're working on if you are using them correctly. If you try to use it to look up individual features (I tried to use it that way the first time) it will not be very helpful because the book builds a skill base in each chapter and expects you to have some understanding of those skills in later chapters. Without that base the book can be down right confusing.<br /><br />I got a chance to check out the new edition and have found it to be much the same. It is every bit as thorough as the original was for the first version of Aperture 3 and covers the new features that were released up until 3.3 such as the improved highlighting and shadowing tools and the improved white balance tool. (On a side note the amazon description says that this version was optimized for 3.3 while the Peachpit site description says it is optimized for 3.4. A little confusing, but since 3.4 didn't contain many new user features this probably isn't an issue). Having continued to use Aperture for a while before this guide came out I had a decent grasp on the new features, but my learning curve would have been improved with the new guide and my technique did get a little fine tuning.<br /><br />So is the new guide worth the few extra dollars over the old guide?  ABSOLUTELY.  If you're learning the product for the first time go with the new guide. Some of the menus have changed since the software first came out so your learning experience is going to go a lot smoother with the updated guide and its the only way to get the complete run down on the new features.<br /><br />If you have the old guide do you absolutely need to upgrade?  I don't think so (unless you're applying for the certification)... If you weren't baffled when 3.3 came out and/or you have access to an internet connection you should be fine. When new features come out people are only too eager to try them out and post their experiences. You've already got a strong base and are going to be able to digest whatever directions you find online. So save yourself a few dollars, run a google search, and learn what you can about the new features.<br /><br />With all that said...<br />This is still the definitive book for those looking to learn the ENTIRE Aperture program<br />There is no more complete guide<br />There is no guide with better step by step examples<br />If you're serious about photography and have settled on Aperture to edit and manage your photos this is the book to buy hands down
B007SGLZP8|5.0|iT WAS ANOTHER EXCITING GRISHAM BOOK<br />SURPRISE WAS ALSO INCLUDED AND MADE ME ENJOY THE<br />STORY ALSO A FAST READ BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSE<br />WAITING FOR MORE
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is amazing. I am so addicded to it. I play it more than four times a day.if I had to discribe it in three words (Wich would be hard) it.would be best game ever. I love that game.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The book was great but it did lack some of the excitement that the earlier ones had. I can't wait for the next one. I would recommend this to a friend.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|This album is really growing on me. It was recommended to me when I needed something to get me through a long afternoon at work and since then, its been added to my regular rotation.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is fantastic but it could use some things.  ENDERMEN,BLAZES,SILVERFISH,GOING INTO PORTALS,AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN PC VERSION.Everything else is awesome!

B004LKVHSY|4.0|when it showed up and was in good condition even though the picture didn't seem very good when I was watching it.
B0031RS58I|5.0|It's a typical Kinsella‘s book. Easy to read, fun, girly and exciting!<br />If you like Kinsella, you will love the book!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I waited a LONG time to be able to purchase this CD. I was SO exited when it arrived. I play it so much. I was thoroughly pleased with how quickly it arrived and in perfect condition. Ripped it open and played it loudly in the house and then took it to my car. Playing it so loud the mirror shakes. I only do this for a short period of time so I do not affect my hearing. Ahhhh joyful moments.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|This is another great job by Hans Zimmer. I love the music and the various instruments that he uses to create this funny and breathtaking score. It draws me in and makes me want to go look for mysteries and adventure. Thanks again Zimmer.
B008I43DYU|1.0|why not get a free one with the same features? i bought this accidentally with a stray click and now i'm bitter. careful out there kids.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very nicely set-up weather tool for Android tablet.  Easy to use, read and manipulate.  I like the simple graphics.  It's not overdone.
B0007PALRU|5.0|This item arrived very fast and was a new DVD. Still sealed in its original package. DVD plays great and was an excellent price. I would definitely purchase again from this seller.
0399156704|5.0|It keeps you on your toes. Its great reading. The story line is perfect and you just want to read and read.
B001RJTFP4|4.0|If you're looking for dark comic book action (well done), its worth while to watch Blade one and two. It is a bit too dark and angry for me but I do enjoy a good tale of avengers, and revengers (my word).  For instance, Constantine is one of my favorite movies, even if it does star Keanu Reeves.  He is the right person for the job.  Blade fills this kind of niche. So if you like that kind of dark comic book violence, give it a try.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! it's awesome and good to pass the time with. add maggs888 for a neighbor and gifts
B005LAIGW8|5.0|HI<br />this movie was one that going in to,i had NO HOPE FOR. Having said that.....I LOVED IT.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS FROM HERE ON.IF YOU WANT TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT THE PLOT LEAVE NOW<br /><br />THE RIDERS newest adventure picks up 8 years after the first(however the origin is changed)with johnny blaze living a life of<br />torture. Blaze is hired to retreave a boy.Who turns out has strong ties to blazes power and its originator.<br />now the magority of critics hated on this movie from its lousey special affects to cages overacting.<br />I disagree. Sure the cgi isint the greatest but the rider looks great...I believe that A LOT of the probs people had with this tale of action and fire was CHRISTIAN background. When the first movie came out there was flak. This one got it worse. ANTICHRIST,HEAVEN AND HELL,<br />BIBLICAL BASIS. People arent going to like that.<br />Any body familiar with GHOST RIDER are going to know this and it is this reason that ghost rider is one of my all time fav heros.<br />i find that 90 percent of people i talk to can only complain about the basis..THOR is one of my favs also...he is based on a NORSE GOD yet people dont complain about that do they? People dont like things when they hithome to hard...i am in no way one of those people that like to throw GOD in peoples face...andthor and the norse legends are very intersting to me. ilove that movie..and the comics... but that is my opinion on this movie.. now ill get to good and bad<br /><br /> PROS<br />the action is very well done...<br />cage has realy taken to the role(cage has a GR tatoo and is a fan of the character)<br />the story is a place were the movie shines.<br /> pretty much everything about this movie TO ME was awesome<br />his skull is chared leaving behind the white fresh kull of the fist movie<br />there are alot of little hints to the comics as well as to the BIBLE<br />the acting was imo very well done<br /><br />CONS<br /> THE RIDERS outfit has changed he nolonger has the spikes and buckles<br /><br /> NOW REMEMBER THIS IS MY OPINION AND DOES NOT INFLUENCE YOURS.<br /><br />thanks for reading... CAPTAIN SPARROW OUT
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read the first two books in seven days week each, so I can't say I hated it. The story, although very superficial, irrealistic and poorly written, is engaging and exciting.<br /><br />However I believe that the good that this trilogy brought us was the social acceptance of pornography. Women can finally assume without shame that we enjoy it!!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|The review on the box says \\"Best Film of the Year\\" and I would agree that it's one of the best for sure.  It's beautifully done.....with fabulous acting and an outstanding screen play.  The costumes are lovely, too.  It's an in depth look into the restrictive, oppressed English life in the late 1800's. The thing i liked about it the best is that it ENDS HAPPY.  None of that \\"unspoken rule\\" from Hollywood that says if a movie doesn't end with everyone dying or suffering, it's not a good movie.  This movie fulfills all your fantasies about how injustices should be answered and reminds you that life and love really can be all you want it to be.  Rent or buy it FOR SURE.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors - and he did not disappoint me with this book.  Because of the large amount of characters, I printed out the Character List and checked each off as I met them in the book - helped tremendously to keep everyone straight!  Gave me a deeper appreciation of veterans from any war.<br />I now have Book Two of this trilogy  and can't wait to get into it!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I've never seen such GREAT casting.  Every single person that was selected to play the younger parts of the familiar original cast of the Star Trek TV series, fits each character to an absolute TEE.  IF you're a Star Trek groupie as I am, you'll want to see it for sure but EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT, I promise you this movie can hold it's own against any and all of the top action/adventure type movies out there. So even if you've never even seen a Star Trek Movie (and don't care if you ever do)...I guarantee you that this one is going to impress you.  IF you've seen any of the old Star Trek Movies don't let that dissuade you from seeing this one - this movie is in a class of it's own when compared to the previous attempts to put the Star Trek world onto the big screen.  JJ Abrams directed this and (I guess) he knows how to make a movie for today's audience.  Rent this one tonight....
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! Getting Perry through the tube system can be a challenge. The puzzles are inventive and some take several tries to figure out. For a buck, the paid version is totally worth it. Haven't gotten bored with it yet. You can go back and replay puzzles you've already solved. Hope they come out with new levels soon!
1439152802|5.0|I just loved this book! I have not read Kate Morton before and now I can't wait to read another of her books.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story and so well written, I did not want it to end, as I turned the last page I just wanted to turn another.<br /><br />To say anymore about this story would give away the stunning conclusion.<br /><br />Please if you love reading then read this one!
B000GOUMPI|5.0|Wonderful movie, been a fan for many years now! Happy to find it in HD for cheap!! Great Buy! Now I can watch it anytime anywhere!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|great game in the vein of Bejellewed. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I don't think there will be long term replayability for me. Your mileage may vary though.
B007THA4FI|5.0|JKRowling is a fabulous writer.  I am glad she has written an adult book.  Her writing is simply \\"delightful.\\"  I enjoy her descriptions of each an every character. I'm sure there are many parts of the book that will be etched in my mind.  It's a great book.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is my nine year old son's favorite game of the Kindle Fire. This game is great because it fosters the ingenuity in him, allowing hiss creative and engineering talents to come through. Pretty fun for adults too!
B004XANKVO|5.0|Love it and it meet my requirement, the quality is good and the delivery is on time. so i want to buy the same brand of bag
B0091Q82L8|4.0|The last twenty years has witnessed a virtual torrent of Who releases.  Like every other band that saw its heyday some forty-plus years ago, the bulk of such material is either previously unreleased demos, alternate versions, or in this case live material.  This double-CD set is part of a storied heap that was otherwise tossed wholesale into Bobby Pridden's (actual) fireplace. As the band rode the long wave of success generated by Tommy, a contractual obligation to issue a live album still loomed.  Myth has it that when Pridden (the band's sound wizard) informed Pete Townshend that there were simply too many hours of live tape for either of them to sift through in time to placate their label, the impetuous \\"Trousers\\" quite dimwittedly (by his own admission) insisted that the lot of it be summarily destroyed.  What survived from that rash decision was arguably among the finest raw performances of the era--for that matter of the entire rock genre: Live at Leeds.  This performance recorded at Hull city hall, not unlike Leeds, The Isle of Wight, and Tanglewood, is also a remnant from that phase.<br /><br />Beat for beat, this is a \\"take\\" from the setlist for Leeds.  What stands apart here is the recording quality, and of course the signature volatility of the band's presence.  The listener gets a sonic exposure to the front row.  Akin to  Leeds, the modulation was simply just right.  The mix is not perfect, with Moon's wild slapping sounding tinny at places, and Roger's vocals falling into the background here and there.  Nonetheless, all elements are reproduced with very little distortion.  Apparently Entwhistle's bass line was lost in some parts of the mix and so portions from the Leeds album have been dubbed into this release to even out the resonance.  I detect additional overdubs, but the net effect is sweet.<br /><br />It's great to have this CD, not because I expect surprises but rather because when they come in the form of those unrepeatable flourishes, well I just get goosebumps, as I suspect most diehard fans can relate.  Yes, we are beating a dead horse with this.  Yes, for the flare and unparalleled panache evident in all these shows, there is a commitment to showmanship and consistency.  The band walks some vague line between pop and a sordid circus act.  This is jazz too however.  When Pete Townshend takes a journey through uncharted riffs and scale explorations, it is honestly transcendent. I lap it up.<br /><br />Rock was emerging as both an existential objective for the masses, and the momentary experience which provided escape from a scary and uncertain world.  I'm glad there aren't too many of these recordings floating around.  Each one remains a treasured document of the period.  Needless to say, it is of a class of entertainment that morphed grotesquely in the months and years that followed epic summits.  What happened? A whole lot.  Notwithstanding the ensuing Punk revolution, reality came knocking in ways that only God can strike.  But to the point: The Who of '69 - '70 forged a concert atmosphere that is arguably lost.  What we have been granted is some evidence of their singular alchemy, and my firm belief is that each 'Oo performance was sui generis.  Alas, we have a taste and the rest we can fill in with imagination.st get goosebumps, as I suspect most diehard fans can relate.  Yes, we are beating a dead horse with this.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Purchased this book on the reputation of this author and having enjoyed many of his books previously, however despite the legal intricacies of this novel it seemed there was something missing in the direction of the story and felt perhaps it was a book written to fulfill a contractual obligation and was written in an offhand manner to this effect.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Most of the books of John Grisham that I have read I would give four stars, but the Racketeer did not hold my interest as much as others that I have read.  Nevertheless, a book worth reading.
1594744769|5.0|Loved this book!  Not at all what I expected.  Much more than your run-of-the-mill scary/creepy book.  Loved all the in-depth history and background on everything.  5 Stars!!!
B008MM9630|5.0|It is a lot of fun.  love it,.  I play it daily.  Always has something. new happening.  Can't. wait to see what is next.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Another great movie I saw that I figured my uncle would also like. I sent to him and it was speedy delivery and he loved the movie.
B008O037RG|5.0|At this point I still prefer _Sigh No More_, but _Babel_ is making up ground fast. \\"I Will Wait\\" and \\"Below My Feet\\" are my favorites. The album has the same transcendent feeling as their first. It makes me smile and feel sad and want to shout, even if I don't understand what he's saying. It's terribly emotive, which I consider to be one of the most important traits of good music.<br /><br />And if you buy the vinyl, you get an HD download, too! It's almost like the record is free. Be aware, however, that it does not include the three bonus tracks \\"For Those Below,\\" \\"The Boxer,\\" and \\"Where Are You Now.\\" (By the way, I've listened to their version of \\"The Boxer.\\" Even though it features Paul Simon, I have to say that the original is best.)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|...that I've read in a long time. Plan to give it as a gift to some other sci-fi lovers.  Kept me interested from start to finish.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I absolutely love reading The Huffington Post. This is where I go for all of the latest news and all of the best gossip! I highly recommend this informative paper.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The main character John Corey was a little more over the top with his \\"wise guy\\" comments and thoughts than, I think, in previous books.  Plot was OK, but took a long time to develop.  Felt that the book a slow in the first two thirds of the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't normally read sci-fi type books.  Saw the reviews and thought I would check it out.  Really liked the premise.  The characters were developed just enough and the story moves at a good pace.  I will be looking for the sequels to this series.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|very good processor, fast enough for games, I recommend you buy it or if you want something faster buy the i5 2500k so you have the option to overclock, I bought this product on January 3, 2012
B007SGLZP8|5.0|terrific book; like the ones Grisham first wrote.  keeps your interest throughout and wraps the story up at the end just perfectly.<br />a fast read and well written.
B005HEX4NY|2.0|I find that most of the criticisms of Star Trek: Voyager I hear are not of what it does, but what it didn't do in its seven year run. 'The Void' presents all the problems squashed into 45 minutes.<br /><br />Voyager gets sucked into (another) anomaly that is huge, empty, and inescapable. Several ships have been surviving in the void by pillaging other ships that get sucked in. It's dog eat dog, and it looks like the crew is going to have to make some tough choices if they want to get out of the void.<br /><br />So, this is basically what happened to Voyager in the first episode, 'Caretaker'. They get pulled into new, rough territory. They have no back up, little resources, and a nearly impossible goal. This is a prime setup to challenge the ethics and expectations of a Starfleet ship in the Star Trek universe. Starfleet crews are always the good guys, holding true to the prime directive and performing the greater good for others. What happens though when that is all taken away though? What do you do when you're put into a situation where nobility has to bend and even break?<br /><br />Same as usual apparently.<br /><br />Janeway sticks with her Starfleet code. She'll only raid what was taken from her ship, she starts up negotiations with other ships to form an alliance, and her crew falls into place with her way of thinking. Everything just works out in the end.<br /><br />On one side, it shows how enduring Janeway and Voyager are. On the other, it's boring as hell. Like the whole series itself, 'The Void' takes the less interesting course and it creates for some really frustrating television.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is such a great classic.  Personally I prefer the newer movies but there is something about the simplicity of this movie and the great art.  One of my favorite Disney movies!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I enjoyed this second book also but I liked the first one better. I recommend this as a good read. I am am very much looking forward to reading 'Fifty Shades Freed'.
030758836X|4.0|Best book I've read this year. Deserves all the praise it's getting. Genuinely amazing in all aspects (except maybe one, which I hesitate to bring up). There is also a stunning subtext on writing/reading itself. Who do we believe? Who's telling the truth? Who even KNOWS the truth? Will you believe what I tell you? Really? Do you like me? Hate me? Do I even know myself?<br /><br />Overlay this on a genuine mystery with enough shocks and surprises to knock you back a peg or two, plus one of the sharpest social histories of our current times and what it means to be an American adult.<br /><br />OK (mild spoiler alert): the ending is a bit too random and possibly a little false. But it's OK, and I suppose OK just so... OK after what's come before.<br /><br />But to end the review on a high note: This book is amazing.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. I think the guys should also read it. It would add spice to their relationships
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|just one word \\" amazing\\" this game put your brain to work,my kid spend hours on the game buiding and rebuilding vehicles to get the pigs to the finish line
B002OOG6YY|5.0|As a Manson fan, this dvd definately delivered. Jammed with all the crazy stuff you'd expect to see and more, in addition to an unrivaled level of energy in the delivery by Manson.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever tried to read. It reads like someone writing a jounal. I read about one third of the book and desided it was a waste of my time and money.I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have an open mind to all books. It just takes a little reading to get into the book. Yes her writing is somewhat redundant but its still a good book! I would love to meet a Christian Grey!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It had some interesting twists and turns that kept my interest. Would like to read more from author Gillian Flynn.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this the same week as the natgeo movie came out. It was a great \\"companion book\\" to the movie.<br />There were some things in the movie which seemed to differ but it made the book interesting and the movie easy to follow.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|This is going to be a simple review. In short this has to be one of the best shows I,ve ever seen, possibly the best. I can't commend the writers enough for the great storyline and even better character development. I'm only on the end of season 3 and the show is only getting better. The CGI is amazing and it looks beautiful on Blu ray. Pretty pricey but definetly worth it. And awesome Box set!
0525478817|4.0|The Fault In Our Stars was one of my favorite books that I have read. A perfect audience for this book would be for teens around 15 or 16, though any age above that may enjoy it as well. John Greene does a wonderful job creating dialogue in this novel that makes you feel as though you are interacting with, and know the characters very well. I feel that the characters are what makes this book so special. This book is not solely about cancer, though many infer that.  Anyone who enjoys a great love story between common people that come to realization that they will not live for a long time, will be drawn to this emotional novel. Also, you are always left wanting to read on more. John Greene shows how overcoming and fighting obstacles takes place in everyone's lives, how powerful a bond can be, and truly stresses the most important things in life.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I've admired Ms. Danes' performances since she was in 'My So-Called Life', and I see no reason to quit now.  Add first-rate writing and fellow cast members and one can't go wrong.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Anytime my husband hears I bought a Gerard Butler movie, I can guarantee he'll never sit and watch it for more than 10 or 15 minutes.  But as we watched MGP, the grit, realism & character-believability got his attention and held it throughout. In Sam Childers' moment of revelation there were no harp strings, angels or whie lights -- just a man who found his calling. Good stuff.
B007EDYN36|5.0|This book was great.  Read it in about a week during Hurricane Sandy - no power.<br /><br />Peter is pretty funny.  Shame on Gene and Paul!!!!  Peter you should have held out and demanded more money for the shows you did.  I wish you all the best.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|This album is amazing. I don't know how many times I have listened to it and I still love it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game takes a bit to get used and is slow at first. it takes a while to make money and expanding takes forever but even at that i love it.  the dragons are so cute.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The series is addicting.  The delivery was fast, the item was new.  Can't wait for season 3!  If you love any story set in the past, and in a different country, you'll love this!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|not in the least a bad app!!!! If u need a calculator  this is the app for u!! nothing wrong or glitchy works all the time!!!!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It's cool and funny. Awesome playing and th characters and sou d are just great. Can't wait for another game to come out
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun now that my challenges showed up. I play on Kindle so I don't know what was wrong, but it seems to be working well now.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Gutted I have to wait soo long for entwined in you I loved reflected in you it nearly had me crying a few times :/
B009P13RQY|5.0|I am completely pleased with every song on this collection. Being an existing fan of the band, I was anticipating this new album. They haven't let me down yet. If you like one of their songs then you like them all, but that doesn't mean all their songs sound the same. They are just incredibly good at huge riffs, and hooks that pull you in. Worth every penny.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|my favorite android chess. fits well on my phone and tablet screen. they make great apps that work well. even their free versions are very nice with adds that do not distract too much.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|New condition. Slow shipping time. The seventh season is just as good as the other six! Give it a watch if you've seen the rest.
031620157X|5.0|I ordered this book back in July for myself and fell in love. I let my cousin borrow it, and now she doesn't want to give it back. So I ordered her her own copy for her birthday. Maybe now I can get mine back!
B0033AGPFS|5.0|One of my favorite Jimi H's. tunes is on this. It's Voodoo Child, the long version not the reprise. I was reading that all the people you hear in the background on that song were there in the studio listening to them play and you can here some of the conversations! One book I read on Jimi talks about the high caliber of musicians. The talking at the end of the song is the best. Also if you get the Japanese pressing of this album the cover is different. The US banned it but the rest of the world had no problem with all of the naked women on the cover, in the cover and on the back. It's really really great!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have enjoyed ever novel  Patrica has written, I especially enjoyed this novel as it interjects instances at AFIP were I enjoyed working for 19 years.  Having worked in the Pathology environment she broght back many fond memories for me.  Patrica please keep Lucy &Marino in you novels.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is my favorite author. He usually has the reader in suspense the whole time. This time is no different. You dont really know who is the culprit till the end. I like that he has the lawyer being a little on the shady side in this one. Makes a nice change. This is a quick read because you wont be able to put it down!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Allan Karlsson is my new hero and Jonasson deserves a medal for creating such an inspiring character. Served up in a wonderful style of writing, the mischief and intrigue just keeps on coming. Understanding that the story is far-fetched, Jonasson occasionally acknowledges the challenges of a centenarian but keeps alive the drive in the old man, making it just quite possible that all the wonderful adventures might really be able to happen. You don't even care about the corpses! The companions he meets along the way are just as interesting. Finally, the flashbacks to Karlsson's historical wanderlust past provide the history that motivates the main character and keeps the story getting better and better on the to end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|All I can say is awesome! This season has had me on edge from the get go!  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have had this case for almost a year now and have used it daily. Sure the elastic band is a little worn and fuzzy now, but I have probably had it wrapped around the back of my hand while reading for close to 750 hours. By the way, it still holds the screen cover tightly in place. The case has done a great job of protecting my Kindle Fire from various kinds of abuse and I would buy another one in a minute.
B007N31XTY|5.0|I was a bit skeptical going into this movie and was pleasantly surprised.  The story was excellently done, with a few bonuses over the original.  The cast was excellent, and the Blu-Ray effecys were amazing.  Great story, and fun to watch.
0316228532|1.0|I loved all the Harry Potter books, and I knew going into this book that it was going to be VERY different. But honestly, the Harry Potter books are solid and engaging writing. That is really all that I expected of Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />My first attempt at reading it didn't get me very far as my mind started to wander. Why? BORING! I set it aside to try again later. My next attempt was not much better. STILL BORING! Since there are so many books out there, and so little life, I vowed that my third try would be it. I stuck it out as long as I could....then I promptly listed it for sale on Amazon Marketplace to pawn the misery off on another sucka.<br /><br />I'm a little sad though as I really wanted to like it. But it is just too boring for me to get into it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the entire Virtual city series entertains while stimulating the 'ol grey matter. so far, I haven't been required to use real money to progress.
B005DKLPQ0|4.0|Has anyone besides me noticed that there are two glitches (like a \\"thump\\" sound) in the remaster of Unloveable?  It occurs in two places in the song, on both Louder Than Bombs and The World Won't Listen.  The original issues do not sound this way.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first book.  That being said I enjoyed it and am now almost finished the third volume.  I am finding them a little depressing and I really think that even a little bit of happiness would have gone a long way to make the books even that much better. I almost keep waiting for something nice to happen.....
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is so much fun to play !<br />Another perfect game by Rovio !<br />Already waiting for a new idea by Rovio to play :D
B0092C2X7U|4.0|Really fun game and difficult to get through.  Only concern is that it uses a lot of battery on my Galaxy Note.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|fantastic Sci Fi movie, great effects and characters and a story line you can do what you like with,<br />definately one to keep in the collection to watch again
B009C5Z112|5.0|This was a band that came out of nowhere for both me and my wife.  This album has an incredible sound to it.  Technical metal with harmonies that stick in your head way after listening.  This is truly one of the best Metal releases this year!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Very enjoyable sci fi movie, effects are very entertaining although tongue in cheek at times and<br />characters work well, a movie worth watching again
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the perfect bible for someone trying to read the good book without feeling overwhelmed. The fact that you can download the bible in the many written versions directly onto your tablet, so that you can read the bible anywhere without Internet connection is great.  This app also has reading plans so that you can read through the bible.... It's great!!!
0061692042|1.0|I took a long break from Richard Ford after being disappointed by The Sportswriter.  I should have stopped with that one.<br /><br />Ford ruins all hopes of a plot by constantly telling the reader what is about to happen.  Instead, he spends all his time writing about the characters moping around waiting for the events, and discussing how what happened affected (effected?) the rest of their lives.<br /><br />This book is boring.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was hooked from the very first chapter.  The story draws you in so quickly and makes you question what could Malcolm, a lawyer, have done to end up in prison.  Of course, no man that attractive could be guilty (in my minds eye, I picture  Denzel Washington).  He's not only good looking, but smart; too smart to stay in prison.  And so begins the adventure.  The FBI will find that dealing with Malcolm is not as easy as they thought.  Malcolm has his own agenda and they soon find that out.  There are so many twists and turns that keep you guessing. Even when you find out that you were right, you can't stop reading.  I will say that the end is a bit of a nail biter.  I highly recommend The Racketeer!
B00976QBBU|4.0|It was nostalgic to see Michael working and creating, all his weirdness and unbelievable talent revealed.<br />It's sad to think he was tormented by devils that didn't allow him a natural goodnight's sleep and it lead to him death.  Watching the documentary I had to buy the cd in tribute to his brilliance.
B006BQFUOS|4.0|I read the novel about a year ago and was very moved so I was very anxious to see the movie. While the movie was not as great as the book it still was very good. However most people would not understand the movie unless they read the novel first as the movie did eliminate many key points about the story.
B0071T4BVC|4.0|Saw the documentary on tv had to buy the cd.<br />Great artists collaborate on this cd, dianna krill and her band backing Paul.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|SOA keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love the characters, story line and can't wait for season 5.
B004HX4RT6|3.0|I don't think it's worth a great \\"review\\".  I personally prefer a game called Rage of Bahamut.  It's a great game for Android or Iphone and has great artwork.  It doesn't take a lot of your time, unless you want it to...and it challenges you just the right amount.  After the tutorial it will ask for a referral code.  Enter LBC57509 and you'll get a free rare card and 50k rupies to help you out!  I really think you'll like it...and it's FREE.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I'm so sad! I thought this was another angry birds game. I am so disappointed. I guess i should have known, since the title is Bad Piggies, AND NOT ANGRY BIRDS! lol! Anyway..if you're  looking for a game that's a little more involved, you'll probably like Bad Piggies. I did give it a try for a few days, but just couldn't get the hang of it, especially since there are no instructions on how to build the vehicles. You have to kind of guess what to do. And it's not really clear how to move the vehicle either, or clear about the objective of the task. I'm sure it's  a very cool game for those who have the patience & play games all the time. I, on the other hand, will stick to what i can handle..simple mindless fun by just pulling back a slingshot and letting it rip!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love how this is the &quot;classic&quot; Star Wars. Gameplay is fantastic. I can't wait till Hoth is released! It's my favorite planet :)
B009DJB9HC|2.0|There's some semi-decent rock and roll here but honestly I think Joe Bonamassa is walking a fine line of saturation. In the last few years he's been pumping out music and touring like a mad man. And it shows here. No one can continue to pump out quality music at this rate. He needs some time off to focus again.<br /><br />The other 3 guys in this band are OK but no where near the caliber musician that Joe B is. Again on this album Sherinian has been relegated to filler. Glen Hughes should have been done years ago and Bonham ...well..good but nothing stellar.<br /><br />The mix here is nothing special either. Though not horrid it's pretty flat and lacking any kind of depth.<br /><br />If you're a die hard fan of these guys ...meh...it's just OK. Joe's solo stuff is superior in every way.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|The fake reviews suck.  If the game is impossible and the only positive reviews is from someone that does not have a firm grasps of the English language it is safe to say they came from the same person. 3 attempts is not enough... the physics of the jumps for some of the apparatus is off... bad bad game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series but you must have the next book ready when you finish the first and second books. Thank goodness for my kindle!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm a mom of 2 little kids, so I have to share my Kindle Fire with my kids. This MicroShell has kept my Kindle in one piece!  I am on my 3rd Kindle.  The first suffered from a shattered screen.  If I had had a microshell on it at the time it would not have broken. (The second Kindle stopped charging for some unknown reason) I bought a pink case so that I would be able to find more easily in my house or in my purse. It has been dropped, crushed, you name it, and this shell has done a great job keeping my Kindle in one piece.  It fits perfectly, and the elastic strap makes holding the kindle easier and secure. Make sure to pair this up with a screen protector.  You will be glad you did!  I'm planning on purchasing a new Kindle Fire HD in the larger 8.5 size.  Marware PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make this product for the larger Kindles & Please make it in more colors.  It's a superb product! I look forward to being your customer again! Thank you.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I went to see them live in Portland. They were absolutely AMAZING. From stage, lighting to little details of the show, they were filled with the Coldplay creativity and Mylo Xyloto style. I'd say this is a must buy for Coldplay fans especially if you didn't make it to the show.  Can't wait to get this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so impressed I'm not sure I could live without pinterest! ive gotten so many ideas ans tricks! thank you yo whoever created pinterest! your a genius!
B00846REIS|3.0|I thought this novel was shallow and did not have a great plot line.  It was not believable.  Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is much better.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It was a very good movie.  One of the best I've seen in awhile... Cast was great and a glimpse into the culture was informative.!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|In our little southeastern Oregon town, we don't get the new movie releases so had to wait until Netflix had it, I kept it for a hold week watching it over and over.  I now have this movie downloaded so I can watch it over and over.  This is fantasy or is it?
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It was a fun movie and it was enjoyable to watch.  It was nice to see all of the main characters from all of the other movies together.  That was a fun concept!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun to play.  I like being surprised at what is going to be hatched.  Just don't like the long wait times.
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|I am and American teaching college in Vietnam.  I first tried to order this product on my Kindle.  I was unable to do this.  So I ordered it through Amazon on my laptop.  I succeeded in ordering it, but could not transfer it to my Kindle.  So I tried to watch it on my laptop.  It was impossible to watch.  It timed out, and if I paused it, it started again from the beginning.  After an hour without success, I gave up.<br />Fortunately, Amazon eventually refunded my fee.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This third installment in the Stieg Larsson trilogy picks up where the second book left off. Lisbeth Salander is in the hospital recovering from her injuries. Things get complicated from there, when she finds out that her father is also recovering at the same hospital in a room just two doors down the hall. This third book seems to drag a little in the first half with an overload of background information. All in all, the story moves along to a satisfying conclusion, that left me feeling that I had been along on an epic action adventure, and met some amazing people along the way. An incredible trilogy!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|My group of friends had this game for about two years.  Each time we sat down to play games and looked at this we put it back in the box.  It looks pretty complex.  It actually is complex, but as with anything once you know how, it's easy.  Also true is that you get out of something what you put into it.  Once we actually took the time and effort to read the directions and play through a game, it turned out to be a lot of fun.  There is a lot of strategy involved and you may think you know who is winning when you really don't.  It's a solid game, but not for those who don't like strategy games.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read all the time and what keeps me interested in a book is a great storyline, and this book has it! There are a few surprises, twists, turns, and an unusual love story. It definitely keeps you interested and waiting for the next book by this author!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|\\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\". Great movie, right? Of course it is! So WHY cut it UP?? Disney, for some idiotic reason unbeknownst only to them, decided to cut the beautiful song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" from this blu-ray movie because (are you ready for this?) \\"it was too sad for a Disney movie\\". Director Brian Henson couldn't even get it reinstated! So, before you spend the bucks for this blu-ray, you're NOT getting the true movie. You want an UNCUT version? You'll have to get alternate DVD or VHS version. OR get a laserdisc to get a prestine WIDESCREEN version WITH the song intact. Disney! WTF???
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love trilogies and this series is no exception. Great continuation of the crissfire series! People have said it is a rip off to 50 shades of grey, but I have read that series too and the crossfire series is a completely different type of storyline. The main male characters may be similar but you can read the difference between the two. Now I can't wait for the third book to come out.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is a good type of time filler. There is not much thinking involved so you can play while waiting.
B008AYCSE4|5.0|Anyone who is an independent film lover will need to watch this movie. But for those of you who get squeamish easily won't want to see it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun game that has increasing difficulty as you go through the levels. You should be sure to save up your Bombs and lightening bolts for the harder levels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A pleasure to read, getting lost in this book is very easy just like all the other books in suzanne's library.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Sandra and Ryan have great on screen chemistry. Some very funny moments, and Betty White really rounds it out with her wonderful sense of humor.
1416550534|5.0|Loved the story line, and the time frame of this mystery, that starts just before World War 1, in England. Lot's of twists and turns take you to an ending that is not what you expected.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have nothing but good things to write about this app, hence the five stars! It is easy to use. It is feature rich. It is easy to share verses via many different ways. I like the fact that you can read from the bible as well.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I think this item is best for people who are fans of doctor who or people who are obsessive about it.<br /><br /> It love it and draw a lot with its pen attachments. My family enjoys it to but they probable sometimes  get annoyed.<br /><br /> It is the same size as the one in the show. It is plastic and lights up. Like David Tennat's it gets longer with a slide.<br /><br /> I enjoy that it is the same size as in the show. It has a uv ink with light and normal pen. It gets longer.<br /><br /> I only wish it was a little smaller for my small hands.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Im a heavy sleeper &amp; this works great. I love that you can set it where you need to do something (like math problems, which I hate at 43o AM) before it will dismiss. Keeps me from waking up late.<br /><br />Im known for ignoring alarms so thats deff my favorite part :)
0393338827|5.0|\\"The entire industry had been floated on the backs of the rating agencies, but the people who worked at the rating agencies barely belonged in the industry.\\" (156)<br /><br />Lewis is a brilliant writer and master storyteller, yet he sticks to the facts and educates the reader about what really happened. It's nigh impossible to read this without getting angry and horrified about the irresponsibility of the banks and the incompetence of the regulators.<br /><br />This book describes how many pension funds were ruined. Many pension funds can only invest in AAA rated bonds. Because the regulators slapped AAA ratings on all kinds of junk, those pension funds value plummeted when those bonds became worthless. Instead of punishing Wall Street, right-wing politicians blamed those with pensions (teachers, cops, firefighters), and have gone after those civic-minded workers instead of the individuals who destabilized the economy in the first place (but that is a tale for a different time and with a different book).<br /><br />Near the end of the book, Lewis wrote this haunting paragraph (which has rattled around in my brain for a few years now):<br /><br />\\"The people in a position to resolve the financial crisis were, of course, the very same people who had failed to foresee it: Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, future Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack, Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, and so on. A few Wall Street CEOs had been fired for their roles in the subprime mortgage catastrophe, but most remained in their jobs, and they, of all people, became important characters operating behind the closed doors, trying to figure out what to do next. With them were a handful of government officials --- the same government officials who should have known a lot more about what Wall Street firms were doing, back when they were doing it. All shared a distinction: They had proven far less capable of grasping basic truths in the heart of the U.S. financial system than a one-eyed money manager with Asperger's syndrome.grasping basic truths in the heart of the U.S. financial system than a one-eyed money manager with Asperger's syndrome.

1616960922|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of the few living fantasy authors who can actually come up with new, unique magical systems.<br /><br />And his novella \\"The Emperor's Soul\\" introduces a fasincating new kind of magic -- Forging, in which a person can overwrite reality with what might have been. It's only a novella, but Sanderson proves that he doesn't need a 400-page tome to write a powerful, action-packed story with a well-developed heroine.<br /><br />The expert Forger Shai is in prison, awaiting execution by the Rose Empire, when she's offered a chance to earn her freedom. The Emperor has been assassinated, and while they were able to fix his body, his mind is now gone. His advisors have bought some time by claiming that he's grieving for his wife, but that will only last ninety days.<br /><br />They need Shai to do something terrible: Forge a new soul for the Emperor. Not only is it considered an abomination, but it's incredibly difficult.<br /><br />Shai has no choice, so she begins learning everything she can in order to create a soulstamp for the Emperor -- which is no easy task, since she has to know what kind of person he truly was. But the hardest task may be planning her escape, especially since she's now enmeshed in a deadly political scheme.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson is a master of the doorstopper fantasy epic, but \\"The Emperor's Soul\\" proves that he's just as good in shorter works. And while the action rarely even moves outside of Shai's room, he manages to give the feeling that we've dropped into a rich, well-developed world that is just begging for exploration.<br /><br />He also creates a really fascinating magic system -- it can turn any item/person into what it MIGHT have been. For instance, a broken window can be turned into the stained-glass masterpiece it once was, by suggesting to it that it was repaired by a skilled artisan.<br /><br />But as he sketches that out, Sanderson weaves around lots of political intrigue and scheming, so that Shai has to constantly be two steps ahead of people who want to harm her. Not only does she have to grapple with the malevolent Frava, who wants Shai dead and the Emperor as a puppet, but a bone-and-blood-sorcerer who can track her down if she escapes.<br /><br />And as the ninety-day period twists down to its end, Sanderson ramps up the tension. The climax is an eruption of action-packed martial arts, traps and grotesque sorcery, in which we see Shai using her skills on herself.<br /><br />Shai is a truly likable heroine -- she's clever, tricky and knows plenty about human psychology, but she also has a kind heart. Her appreciation for the art of Forgery, and in making things better through it, has some intriguing implication for the new Emperor. And Gaotona is a fascinating foil for Shai -- an elderly, rather fussy man who sees Forgery as an abomination, but is clear-sighted and honest enough to learn about it from Shai.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's Soul\\" is a beautiful, rich little piece that shows Brandon Sanderson's skill, and introduces us to a new world that I hope he will revisit. Definitely a must read.constantly be two steps ahead of people who want to harm her.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Hidden object games are my favorite. Enigmatis is totally absorbing. The plot is intricate as a detective puts together the clues to solve the case. Challenging puzzles, eerie graphics are engrossing. Spend hours unraveling the mystery of missing people in Maple Creek. Worth the 2 bucks and then some. Can't wait to start Enigmatis 2
B001C34HUS|5.0|I read about this in a wonderful curated blog called \\"Brain Pickings.\\"  I suggest anyone who enjoys life, literature and just plain thinking, will enjoy it.  Years ago, too, I attended a great class through UCLA Extension on the Creative Process.  Taught by a psychologist, he outlined over the course of weeks, what this book distills in a few pages.  Not that I didn't like that class (I did, a lot), but reading a short book beats weeks in a classroom every time.<br /><br />The most important part of this process, as far as I can tell, is what I'd call the incubation period - where you take your focus off your problem or issue and just allow the creative process to work.  That's really hard for many of us because we don't trust that this process CAN work or WILL work for us on our problem or issue.  That strikes me as normal and human and yet, because I have a hard time with this too, rather sad in a way.  One way I try to overcome this is to keep some sort of meditation habit in force which just helps me calm the part of my mind that doesn't believe in either the benevolence or at the very least, neutrality, of the universe.  Which it seems to me, the creative process, is a big part of.<br /><br />This book closes with a truth - people reading this will be enthused at first and then not use the process.  Oh, maybe once or twice, but over time they'll forget it.  I agree with this, but I'm determined to be more active in inviting in the muse to help me creatively.  I strongly suggest that you read this, practice, and have fun with it!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Was not impressed the first time I saw the movie. A few months went by. I decided to watch the whole Alien series, including this movie. I was much happier watching this the second time with all the knowledge and plot details from the original movies.
B0086700CM|5.0|Addicting. Well thought out and simple game for all ages. How many more words do I need to praise this game?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 5 year old and I play this game almost daily. I save the acorns, and he spends them!<br />the game can keep you engaged, but does get a little monotonous around level 32. It picks back up, so don't get discouraged.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book keeps you guessing until the end!! Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer.  Can't wait to read her next book!!
B00866H7SS|3.0|A good read just a little bit to much like fifty shades, however a lot less repetative and clearly better written.
0316017930|5.0|Bestselling author Jason Andrew Bond--When readers contact me and tell me how they can get started writing I recommend two books.  One is directly related to writing (Stein on Writing) and the other is Outliers.  Understanding what is in this book is so critical to personal success in any field that I think it should be required reading for high school students.  I found it entertaining, well-written, and informative.  If you're considering reading this book, don't hesitate any longer.  It is WELL worth your time.
B004XNGKBS|2.0|Hard to get settings dialed-in for optimal Kindle Fire use to produce good looking writing. This app is made to produce rendered handwriting as an image. Has nice export options like to Evermore. Can't use it to sketch since you're locked into line by line writing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Let me keep this short and basic. The game is a really fun take on angry birds. The birds have (most of them anyways)been transformed into the star wars characters you know and love. The HD is great. I'd say its the best looking game yet! The gameplay is vastly improved i'll try and maintain the surprise for you, but even the red bird (after a certain point) has an ability. Also (thanks amazon and/or rovio) the extra, more challenging. The game has some nice animations and, overall, it is a fantastic spin for both franchises. Thanks for reading! (okay ill admit it it wasn't exactly short and basic, but I got a little inspired, so I kept writing)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|From the first time i played the cd in my car tootling across town, i fell in love with the sound of steve nelson on the cello.  The combination of him and the piano is out of this world.  Alex boye adds so much depth with his singing on peponi!!!!  A must buy for any classical music lover
1432794426|5.0|Karen did an amazing job portraying Michael Jackson in this in-depth tribute. The 2nd edition was better and stronger than the first and Karen was very comprehensive of his last years.<br />The book was a wonderful tribute of celebrating his short lived life...
B00991TCOG|5.0|You just have to listen to the first couple of tracks to discover that the violin can take on a life of its own in the hands of lindsey stirling.  I have this cd in an endless loop in my car, as every time i hear a piece of music, i hear many more new wonderful sounds!
B00004TH83|5.0|For listeners who wants to hear a very expressive and beautiful voice singing romantic (adult-contemporary) pop songs in the vein of Celine Dion, but without that kind of excessive \\"sharpness\\" in the highs that sometimes reminds a scream.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|The dark knight returns really captures the style and appearance of Frank Millers work. A must see for any fan of the bat.
B008S7EPXA|3.0|We all have fond memories of music groups in their youthful prime. You recall that premier album that stood out as in your collection as the one to play when introducing a friend to a new sound. REM with Green (and a surprisingly mature success with Automatic for the People), Peter Gabriel with So, and Dead Can Dance with Toward the Within.<br /><br />Alas, every artist / band / group has their denoument. You can see it coming, and sometimes the artist does too. Other times, it's a realization that no one else but the core fans buy up the next recording thinking it will capture the magic of the listeners moment they fell in love with the artist, and when the artist was on fire with creative passion.<br /><br />Dead Can Dance has produced a non-thematic album of songs which don't really fit together. It feels like they are revising previous works by using the sound of their brightest stars in their song galaxy. I feel the love and desire of the songs to want me to love them back, but its like looking at pictures of family departed -- It doesn't capture the emotion of having the person in the room with you.<br /><br />I added this to my rainy day or contemplative playlist, but I don't find myself putting this on repeat and playing it daily.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|On Wings of Eagles is a fascinating story of courage, heroisim, and sacrifice. In a world where coporate types are often branded as bad, On Wings of Eagles is an example of what men and women can do when they are united in a common purpose. With a cast of unforgettable individuals, this book is a must read for anyone who loves this country and wants a compelling read to boot.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a nice game. Each level builds on the prior levels.  Some games the rules are vague so you learn as you go.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like hidden pictures I don't like them to be so easy that I am bored with game but on the other hand I don't want so hard that I get frustrated or have to use hint button so much that it is ridiculous. This game isjust right
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Con questa potente app puoi trasformare istantaneamente un pc o un notebook in una sorta di nas o server al servizio del tuo tablet: ti repIica il desktop e tu puoi fare da lontano tutto, dal chiudere o aprire o usare programmi fino a vedere direttamente film interi! Eccezzionale.
0525953728|4.0|Received the book in the mail and finished it before I went to bed.  Good read, tells just enough to keep your curiosity piqued, yet does not divulge any classified information.  Loaned it to my brother and he read it cover to cover in one day too and neither one of us are avid readers.  If you like military stories this is a good one.
B008X9Z4I8|3.0|we like the product but the zipper does tend to get stuck.  The texture fit and color are great just fix the zipper.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One thing after another! Collins leaves no stone unturned! Can't wait to read what's next! I loved the book and all the new characters!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I'm giving this movie three stars because of the stunning visuals, which is about all that it has going for it. There are just too many places where it feels like the screen writer didn't even try. We have archaeologist that seem unconcerned with contaminating new finds, biologist that think potentially dangerous lifeforms are meant to be played with, geologist/mappers who can't find their way out of some straight tunnels (and where was the command post with it's holographic projection?), women who can only run in straight lines, advanced yet somehow misogynistic medical devices, and top secret areas that are general left unlocked. I'm not disappointed that I watched the movie, because it *was* quite beautiful, but I have to say the that writing came close to being insulting.
B008NMT684|5.0|I bought his app for my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson to play on my Kindle. He loves it and has mastered all the puzzles.
B005XN31LY|1.0|I am american military living overseas, and when we pad for the whole season, it would not play. I paid so much money, and got the show, for it not to work. It was a complete waste of money.
0425263916|5.0|Now I don't know what to read, I loved Gideon!!! GREAT love story, hot and steamy. Can't wait until book 3, can't wait until May.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Although I enjoyed this book, I can't give it more than three stars. At points in the book as your reading its very interesting and holds your attention, then next you know it goes into a lot of rambling that totally brings the interest point to 0. I found myself skipping pages especially towards the end. The ending leaves you saying \\"is that it\\"!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I went into this thinking it was going to be lame CGI, with lame acting. The characters were truly awesome and believable. The storyline great, and the leaving me wanting so so so much more. I wish they made this into big screen movie/movies. I have always wanted HALO to go to movie form and this did not disappoint. All smiles!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Purchased this game for my grandkids and it's a BIG hit......the graphics are unbelievable.<br />Can't think of a better way for them to spend their free time, especially since this game has no violence.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the Badass movie of all time, its great for the kids, Guys of all ages and the woman. Its an overall type of movie that will be love for a long time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game to play and not have to worry about life. its fun and addictive. its just like the games we used to play at arcades.
0756405890|5.0|I read this book back in 2007, and find myself reading it every year since. I mostly listen to the audio book read by Nick Podehl who is a fantastic narrator for this series. I read some of the reviews for this piece of work, and must confess dismay at seeing ANY one star ratings. I suppose to each their own, but if you enjoy reading Terry Brooks, George R.R. Martin, Vladimir Nabokov, or Brandon Sanderson then you will definitely love this series. The main character is complex and interesting with a shroud of mystery. All I can really say is read it, you won't regret it.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|This was a good movie i would recommend this movie to family and friends it was that good, i may share it to see if they like it
B0044C3RB4|5.0|We started watching Fringe casually, and we are now hooked, every episode just sucks you in. It is facinating on so many levels, just when you think you've lost the thread, you get it again and have an urgent need for more!
B00466HN6S|5.0|I gave this movie as a gift and she loved it as well i also brought one for myself and it was a good movie
B009PJXY3M|5.0|I love her album so much, and I'm (almost) a 20 year old guy. She's an amazing singer. It would be cool if she actually read the reviews of her album because I want her to know how good it is, lol.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was a good movie a lot of action in this one, i would recommend this movie to friends and family
0345803485|1.0|I've read all three book in this series, but by Fifty Shades Darker, the second of the series, I knew it was going to be a long haul.  I read all three hoping the next one would get better; I wanted to like them what with all the hype I'd read about them. How many times can someone run their hand through their hair or bite their lip?  This isn't writing, it's erotica and that's about it.  If you're into good writing, page turners, etc., don't bother with this.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I loved this movie also it was filled with a lot of action from beginning til end this one i would recommend
B009329Y30|5.0|Like i said, it was touching. It had some comedy, romance for sure, and was the kind of movie that leaves you thinking. I will probably watch this one every year or so. I loved it. Deffinately recommend.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This was a good movie even if it was about killing each other for sport. i am not sure this movie is for everyone
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Atticus is an interesting hero.He is not a traditional, honor bound hero,but one who can be sneaky.  The various pantheons of gods is also a bit different. Reminds me a bit of American Gods, but Kevin Hearne goes a bit sideways with it.  Also, I want a dog like Oberon.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|This movie was great and to think it was based on a true story, i would recommend this movie also to everyone
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This will put you in a great mood.  A real energy maker.  These guys are extremely talented and gifted.  A must have for everyone's collection of music.  Anxiously awaiting their next CD.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is so fun! I love it! Rovio has thought of everything! Please keep making more games! Now all Rovio needs to make is Angry Birds Harry Potter! Ahhh! If they make Angry Birds Harry Potter, I would pay $2.99 in a heartbeat for that!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|was looking for a great deal so i came to amazon to purchase the kiss cd! i have followed them since they started and have every cd they ever put out in the U.S and some european cds too! i love their music! great cd and has alot of the older style music for those that are wondering what this cd is like!!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I saw how much space it takes up its more than the kindle can hold wtf so dont download this if you have a kindle. Anyway the kindle only holds 1 gigabyte.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Its a great book the series is now at the top of my favorite list! Seductive, sexy, what's not to love?!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|not just Kindle fire users.  I have an Asus Tf300 and when i try to connect to my facebook, it says it is already connected, then says I've been looked out of facebook, but would I like to play as a guest?
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed it very much. It was a fast, enjoyable read - I look forward to reading the final book.
B004N868DS|4.0|This is a good product, but could be a little better in a couple of ways.  I bought this mouse pad because it is aluminum and would not flex.  This is important to me because I place it on a keyboard tray and about half of the mouse pad hangs over the edge of the tray, so it is important that it does not bend at all when I roll my mouse over the part that is not sitting on the keyboard tray.<br /><br />Since the pad hangs over my keyboard tray, I use a small spring clamp I bought at Home Depot to clip it to my keyboard tray when I use it.  The clamp is metal with a small rubber tip.  Unfortunately, the metal clamp broke through the rubber one day and left some aluminum colored markings on the edge of the pad.  It's really no big deal, but I wish the black finish around the edges of the pad was a little more durable so that a scratch would not show through so much.<br /><br />I wish the four corner pieces of rubber attached to this mousepad were not there, or were lower.  There are not really high, but I would have preferred to have a flat pad for two reasons: 1) I don't like my mouse pad being raised off the surface it sits on because I find it more comfortable to use a low mousepad, and the rubber feet just make it higher on the desk.  2) because the \\"feet\\" are raised on both sides, they get in the way of moving your mouse sometimes.  I don't want my mouse to hit the rubber feet and stop it from moving!  I've gotten killed in BF3 more than a couple of times because this has happened during the heat of battle.<br /><br />Lastly, I like that there are two different sides, but my mouse doesn't track as well on the smooth side as it does on the rougher side.  It sometimes loses tracking and the on-screen mouse stops moving for a fraction of a second even though I am moving the physical mouse.  I use a Logitech G700 gaming mouse and do not have this issue with other mouse pads.  I suspect it is because of the black or blue color on the smooth side - not sure.  It works fine on the rough side, which is mostly black.<br /><br />Overall, I like the pad, and don't regret the purchase.  I really wanted a flat one, but read reviews about another product that said the surface started flaking off.  I DO NOT have that problem with this product, so am happy for the durability.fine on the rough side, which is mostly black.<br /><br />Overall, I like the pad, and don't regret the purchase.

0446580848|3.0|I have read all of DeMille's books and enjoyed them all. But, \\"The Panther\\" lacks action and the thrills that all his other books have, particularly \\"The Lion\\". This book is wonderful for those who like to learn about the history of Yemen and the Middle East countries. I found it boring and had a hard time finishing it. I just drudged through it to wait for the action to happen, which really never did. The main character, Corey, was his usual wise crack self. Plenty of fun with him but unfortunately not to much fun with the story line.<br />I gave the book 3 stars because of the immense knowledge that DeMille possesses about the Middle East and all his research.<br />Bottom line is the book is boring and did not live up to DeMilles past books.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is an excellent app and very easy to use.  I love having all of these resources in one app.
0316228532|1.0|Well, I finished it. Pushed through to the end, hoping it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />This book had the most unsympathetic cast of characters ever. Truly not one character that I really cared about, until near the very unsatisfactory end.<br /><br />After spending hours in this world I felt like I needed a bath. Not because of the sex, or profanity, or adult-themed plot, but because of the vapid, dull, smallminded people that populated this book. There were no heroes. And the villains were of such weak nasty character that they don't merit the name.<br /><br />Save your time and money.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I thought that this game was pretty fun apart that you could only have 1 evolution temple and breeding place. Other than that whenever I got on, it deluged me with all these announcements. For instance it was &quot; hey! the aurora dragons out!&quot; (or something like that). So the reason I wrote a review was because I could stop it from hugging me to&quot; make a nice review.&quot; Other than that, I noticed it took a while to load when you were visiting someone which is expectable since every dragon is moving so it takes up a bit of time to load it and the dragons. But, I would still recommend the game. ;)
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed all 3 books.  This one seemed to be a little long in places, perhaps a little too many cirlces.<br /><br />I would recommend it to a friend.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really like this app, its not perfect but it works great. It has bugs but with the updates its getting better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Quite an amazing app. Love the graph.![: I have Kindle Fire, and this app is so easy to use and understand.!
B0091REZMW|2.0|Fun but regen doesn't work a lot of the time.  Left for 24 hours and it was still empty.  Uninstalling now.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham is a story teller in the true sense of the word and tells you right off that this is a book of fiction.<br />  I like to imagine Grisham spinning this tale to a group sitting around a campfire listening to him weaving the plot in, out, and around, developing several scenes for you to keep track of. You want to ask questions about some of the events or characters that he describes as he introduces them you are not allowed any questions. ( no skipping ahead)<br />  I did a pretty fast read and as soon as I finished the book, I immediately started again with Chapter one, for a slower read, and it was better the second time through when I knew why the character or the scene was introduced.<br /><br />I haven't read a bad Grisham story. Some are better than others and I rate this one with the better ones.
B009JNXK88|1.0|I am sooo mad at this game. I got to level 31 and exited the game. When I got back on, I had to redo level 30. Then, I get even further, and it puts me back at level one. I hope that this is resolved, it's a fun game, but I'm so annoyed with it right now that this is the rating I'm giving it. I think this game deserves this rating.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its ok and really fun and bawsome cool awsome untouchable unstnkinbeilivable  sweet fun very cool jenga fun war fun t rex awsome
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Loved the access to this movie my girls watched it four times during the time we were able to view it. Good story line and wonderful message of sister love.
B0086700CM|5.0|Buy this app, its free and awesome. You'll be addicted in no time. Some people say it gets boring? Then buy a power up or work up to an objective, beat your high score for crying out loud!
0345803493|4.0|Aside from the constant repetitive actions of the main characters, i must say it was a intresting story, it picks up where the 1st book left off. So to me that was a plus, its hard to keep interested in a storyline when its going ever which way. This book has a little of everything in it and it sticks to the story kinda like a movie. I would say that if you are not into knowing TMI when it comes to sex stuff, then this book isnt for you or this trilogy isnt for you. Altho what is written in it can also be seen on tv a show called Taboo.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of musicals, including modern rock musicals, but I hate \\"Rent\\" (including the original play). Trying to persuade me with desperate fan comments will be a waste of your time. The characters are not likable; they are one dimensional, frivolous, and self-centered. Also the entire reason we are supposed to feel bad for them is because they have aids. Aids is a serious illness that shouldn't be made light of as it is in this horrible production. If you want to see a good play/movie about aids awareness, go see \\"Angels in America\\" instead. Furthermore the story line is slow moving and (obviously because of the weak characters) boring. However, if you've never met a gay person or a stripper before and you think that aids is trendy and fun, this is the movie for you.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was master fully done.  You opened up with curiosity and moved to intrigue turning to intense suspense bringing in just the right amount of conflict leading to a beautifully crafted solution, that was filled with action heightened emotions, heart wrenching pain. Finally you leave us a deluge of questions as we leave to go and obtain the second book in the series.  Thank you
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This was such a cute movie, both of us liked it a lot. Lots of whit and charm. One the order of Sandlot, cute, charming and witty hummor . We would watchint again, we do not watch many movies more than once. I would highly recomend.
B00005NMVP|5.0|Of all that has ever been recorded, there are relatively few albums everyone must have as the foundation to a serious record collection. Whether you memorize the names or bio's of every member of a band, read every liberetto (little book) that explains how each song came to be or not, there are some albums you've just got to have to base a decent collection on. Pick your four revolving favorites and those are the cornerstones to your collection. Al Stewarts, Year Of The Cat, is one of mine. While your cornerstone albums may change with the times or who's asking, every 12 years you'll always come back to the Year Of The Cat.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is an awsome movie that has never been done before. There are plenty of movies with toys that are alive, but none like this. If you're not a fan of foul language or raunchy humor, then this movie isn't for you. If you're not offended by drugs, alcohol and foul language, then this movie is a must purchase.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Like alot of the reviews before mine, I have to agree that this is a instant Christmas classic. It is a wonderful looking movie. The 3D has awesome depth through out the entire movie. There weren't alot of pop out moments, but to be truthful I was so immersed in the movie I never even have a thought to the pop out factor. This is a movie you cannot miss, and the children will love it also. My 8 and 5 year old daughters totally fell in love with this movie. It is very funny and at some points very sad, it is truly a wild ride from start to finish. You and your entire family will fall in love with Arthur (and grandfather Santa)!
B0058YPL66|1.0|Like the other 1 star reviewers, I just can't seem to disengage my disbelief about this show.  It's almost painful to watch.  I can't believe that people can actually enjoy this show.  I guess I'm used to watching more intellectual shows, with excellent characterisation and plot, like 'Breaking Bad', 'The Wire', 'Game of Thrones' and 'Homeland'.  This show is just terrible.  Totally unbelievable.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|It really cool and love it almost same from dc comic book. I can't wait buy batman: the dark knight returns part two dvd.
B004GXZ69W|4.0|I sit at my desk all day, and found that a \\"regular\\" mouse hurts my hand.  I changed to the evulent mouse, and mousing all day long doesn't feel so bad anymore.  While this is not a substitute for good ergonomics, this does help.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book is well written, an easy read with great messages in every chapter that apply to every day life.  I am giving this book to friends and family for the up coming Holiday Season.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The most amazing books I have ever read! And though I have been a Stephen King fan for 35+ years, he's got NOTHING on Hugh Howey! There is just no describing how great these books are! The writing, the story line, the characters, EVERYTHING about them is mesmerizing! Beat \\"The Hunger Games\\" by miles! I just cannot wait to read everything this author has or ever will have! If you want something different and totally gripping, this is it!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|IT STARTED OFF WELL BUT BY THE TIME I WAS 3/4 THROUGH IT I BEGAN SKIPPING PAGES- ALWAYS A BAD SIGN.WHY DO A LOT OF POPULAR WRITERS HAVE DIFFICULITIES PROVIDING A LOGICAL ENDING IT'S LIKE OH WELL LET'S WRAP THIS UP. AND PROCEED TO SLAP A HASTY AND UNSATISFYING CONCLUSION ON THE LAST FEW PAGES
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun game.  the strategy of what powerups to buy and which ways go go is fun fun fun.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a Grisham fan. This book did not disappoint me, although different than what I expected. Delightful, comfortable, intriguing narrative. Just coasted to a smooth satisfying ending. Really good\\"who did what\\" book.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|A great collection of Queen hits. A nice combination of live and remastered.  Saves a ton of money on buying albums individually
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Fun to see the profits. Game starts a liittle slow but picks up after you star making money.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|This is the best crime novel I have ever read - its huge - 3 volumes, each of themn packed with a rivetting tale that works on every level - its has violence and sex and politics and beauty and love and tragedy and mythology - and well everything. I heard the author delivered the three volumes to his publisher and died! So its all over. What an event. This is the best crime novel I have ever read...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I loved angry birds before, but now its pure gold with the addition of star wars. Loved the powers with each character. So much fun!
1451696205|5.0|Get your box of tissues- you will need them.  If you ever struggled in highschool, felt like a dork, different, loved, hated, weird, special, like an outsider or teacher's pet, this is for you.<br /><br />Life changing!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I could not get enough of Seasons 1 and 2.  Season 3 seems to be crossing over to less-believable characters... more like the a comic book... which is what it's based on.  Season 3 seems to have more action and be more exciting, but the less believable characters may lose some people.  They've also split the characters up into two separate stories, which also tends to drag the story pace down.<br /><br />I still love the show - enough that I just ordered the comic book compendiums - but not as much as I did before.<br /><br />The Amazon videos (in HD) are much better quality than my cable company's compressed SD letterbox presentation.  Episodes have been available the morning after the show airs.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Everything has been said. I can't add anything different to the wonderful recommendations that bright, sensitive and refined musical ears from Amazon.com have not already said. Just writing because the malnourished and emaciated review made by Kim Hughes -I don't know who is she or her trajectory as a music critic- makes little justice to one of the best albums of the early 21'st century. With this it is clear now that Sea Change is also one of my favorite records. I have never known anyone who has repented of buy it. Just go for it!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Reminds you of daily lif,e and keeping it simple. Love and enjoy the ones your with.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Yesterday morning I downloaded this app because it would work when the power goes out and oddly enough at 5:30 this morning the power went out and I woke up and needed to go to the bathroom and oddly enough this worked perfect!
B005ONTD42|4.0|I love this toy. Generally I think this is fun for both children and adults (but you do need smart phone to enjoy it anywhere!). My friend has one. I want to buy one too but it is way too expensive. I am waiting for BF deal..
0547564651|5.0|An amazing book that anyone with children/that works with children should read! Paul Tough provides the information in an exciting and interesting way that made me want to not put the book down!
B005J7K950|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite movies. the soundtrack is awesome with amazing songs. I had this movie on VHS but wore it out.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Oh my goodness this cd was excellent! My friends and I crank up the volume and jam out!! I heard rumors that No Diggity from the Riff Off wasn't going to be on the soundtrack and I was a bit disappointed but low and behold its on there!! The soundtrack is worth it its amazing you won't want to stop playing. Only criticism I have is that I wish they made the songs full length and not just under 3 minutes

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was not mad about the game because well whenever I usually lose a game then I feel like I wanna punch the wall or something. but this game when I lost I laughed because dark vaders pig was laughing and I just saw that there was another thing I could explode things and there were e_lan cooler angry birds than before and nothing else is cooler than angry bird starwars.

B003ZSI7R2|5.0|I caught their opening act in Greenville, S.C., at The Who show, and wow!  Such energy and talent from the lead singer, and the band has a constant grove.  I downloaded this album and it absolutely reflects what I saw on the stage.  I look forward to many more listens, and I only hope success can come to this very talented collection of individuals.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|When I purchased this DVD online it stated that it would be shipped to my place in 3-5 business days. I received \\"Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition) just TWO days after I purchased it! The box along with the DVD's inside were in perfect condition. I could not have been happier with my purchase.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Addicting show even if you are not in to this type of show, which I didn't think I was you will enjoy the characters and their relationships, zombies are just a part of it.
0763655465|5.0|This story about a naughty doggy that learns his lesson is one of my son's favorites.  We got it at the local library first and he loved it so much that we bought it.  He tells the dog that he's naughty for eating a whole cake and often repeats Oh No, George! along with the book. Lots of fun and cute doggy illustrations.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Pleasantly surprising! I really wish more people knew about this movie. I don't like horror movies unless they are funny like this one. It goes against so much of what people watch today.
0812992784|3.0|Rushdie has had an interesting life. He has recorded copiously in his journals. And he can write. So there are all the ingredients for a very good memoir. This one almost achieves it's potential, except that it's too long, and in parts rather cheap. It did give me great insights into how publishing business works, how it feels to have a death sentence hanging over you all the time, the workings of high society. But, I personally didn't care for all the dirty laundry of his personal life that he's put up for display here. He seems to be getting his revenge on a lot of people who were close to him, including all his wives. That is cheap. And I never got used to hearing him referring to himself in third person.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works fine for my needs plus always handy.  Best of all the price is right.  Similar to one on my phone but Kindle Fire version is easier for an old man's tired eyes and stiff fingers.
B000002VRZ|4.0|THE OUTLAWS-BEST OF THE OUTLAWS/GREEN GRASS &amp; HIGH TIDES: THE OUTLAWS never achieved the name recognition enjoyed by fellow southern rockers ZZ TOP or THE ALLMAN BROTHERS, but this tough posse, led by singer/guitarists HUGHIE THOMASSON and HENRY PAUL was a force to be reckoned with during their mid seventies reign. Favoring a three axe attack like fellow Floridians LYNYRD SKYNYRD, GREEN GRASS &amp; HIGH TIDES was their epic answer to FREE BIRD, a subtly building, wall of noise super jam that ran ten minutes in the studio version and much longer on the concert stage. Fan faves HURRY SUNDOWN and THERE GOES ANOTHER LOVE SONG, steeped in THOMASSON's twangy vocals and earthy songwriting, could have been big country hits if marketed to the Stetson and boots set. (GHOST) RIDERS IN THE SKY, a traditional cowboy classic tackled by everyone from JOHNNY CASH to FRANKIE LANE, proved to be a notable parting shot for THE OUTLAWS, who packed it with all the fire and brimstone imaginable, scoring their biggest radio hit in the process. It's all wrapped up smartly on this crisp sixteen track sampler chronicling an underrated band with an over the top attitude towards downhome Dixie rock.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR GUN BELTS
B004MMEF30|5.0|I had not read anything by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle since my high school days, some 35 yrs ago. I remember it being quite droll and boring. However, as I get older, perhaps I'm better able to appreciate this style. I was pleasantly surprised at how enthralled I became once I started reading this story. He describes Baskerville Hall and the surrounding moor with great detail, creating an eerie and suspenseful setting. The story also moves along at a decent pace, with many tidbits of information at every turn. The wide range of characters, each with their own secrets, or at least suspicious behavior, make for an interesting roster of suspects and possible motives. As with many mysteries of this sort, reading Holmes thought process as he reiterates the clues and ties them all together is always fascinating. Highly recommended reading.
B004HKJDMU|1.0|The book is poorly written. He writes it in a way that makes the study of economics sound difficult. It isn't. I have read many books & articles on the subject and this was the most annoying to read.
0143106333|5.0|I purchased 6 of these Deluxe Edition books to give as rewards to students when reading during our school's Parents As Reading Partners (PARP) program.  The kids love this book!  The illustrations are wonderful and the size of the book is perfect for elementary students.  It was a very popular reward!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Had I not known the author of this novel, I would have thought it a novice attempt at a trashy novel intended for an unsophistacated reader.  Ms. Rowling shows NONE of the extraordinary imagination of her previous Harry Potter books.  Casual Vacancy is a dull, gossipy story of a small village of disfunctional families. Abuse of teen-agers seems to be the central theme.  One star is too many for this book!
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I've been a fan of these guys from the very beginning...Dream On, Mama Kin, One Way Street and all of the early stuff. There are many who call themselves fans who insist the only good Aerosmith was the stuff from the first four albums. Well, that's a very small part of what they've done. Those people remind me of Clatpon \\"fans\\" who insist everything that followed Layla didn't measure up to that one song. To these people I say \\"Open your minds and listen\\"...Aerosmith has had its highs and lows over the four-plus decades they've been around. I was very pleased when Permanent Vacation came out. A STRONG comeback with something for everyone...a joy from start to finish. Lots more success followed that one with Pump, Get a Grip and so on. This new album is their first release of all-new material in quiote some time and you know what? It's just what I needed to hear from these guys. Gritty rockers, some of their best ballads and some of Steven Tyler's most powerful vocals ever. I was skeptical when I first heard that Tyler was joining the crew of American Idol, but the band found out when they performed on the show, they have a whole new generation of fans and this new material bridges the gap. It has their vintage sound and it has a new edge to it too. It's hard for me to pick any one standout track yet because on first listen I was hooked, waiting to hear the next track. I appreciate that it took some time to record this one but more than that, I just appreciate that they're still making music and that it's this good. I defy anyone who thinks this album syinks (as one reviewer put it) to come out with something themselves that's as good or better. These guys have been at it a long damn time now, and I couldn't be happier that they're back with all-new material. Cheers, boys...yo've done Boston proud once again!

B008OOYALE|4.0|fun game! I wish Team Lava did not charge so much for gold. But thats the only reason I rate at 4 instead of 5 stars.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book has left me in a quandry as I try to review it. There were many things I liked about it, most of all the style the author uses. I felt the author was, in a way, teasing her audience, using mind games. She uses the diary format, and draws you in, making you think you are discovering the character of Amy.  But it was all Amy's way of convincing us she was the \\"good guy\\" and Nick was the \\"bad guy\\". I thought this was effectively used to portray Amy as a controller, and, in fact, a bad person. So I enjoyed most of the book, but the ending was a huge disappointment.  The book sort of dropped off a cliff with no satisfactory conclusion. Also, by the end, I lost most of respect and liking for both main characters.  I really didn't care much about them as the book finished. Amy was crazy, bad, and incredibly strong.  Nick was weak, and I didn't feel he would ever escape Amy's control.  I also thought some editor should have worked with this author to make this book more satisfying. I think it could have been done.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|excellent,good reading i finish the book in 3 days. I like most all of his books. reading books on my kindle is best way to read.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|I think this could have been funnier. if it had more action, like it did toward the end of the movie.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I'm hooked! The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever. I can barely wait every Sunday to watch it!!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My 7 year old appeared to really like it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that she seemed to enjoy the older movies more.

B002436WFI|5.0|A must for any Diskworld fan. This movie, along with Hogfather and Going Postal, are well done with great actors and give a real feel from the books.

B008FTAAG2|5.0|i recently heard of In this Moment because of the Halestorm tour, so i thought id give them a listen.. and man, i love this album!  even as a christian.  growing up some of my favorite rock artists were (and still are) motley crue, metallica, AC/DC, Korn, White Zombie (not so much the new stuff).  so if i still like that music, i dont have much room to criticize albums like this one.<br /><br />that being said, for me, i look at what they've done in videos.  i dont like it when artists bombard the audience with satanic symbolism in their videos.  and nowadays, unfortunately it is VERY widespread.. especially in hip/hop and pop music.  upside down stars and crosses, all seeing eye, pyramid, etc.  its pretty crazy.  just do some research yourself, and you will see what im talking about.<br /><br />now, if you are an atheist and shrug that kind of stuff off.. thats fine, but for myself its pretty offensive.  i mean nine inch nails had some pretty insane videos, but i dont recall seeing that kind of symbolism, even in those videos.<br /><br />with In this Moment, the videos for blood (and obviously the cover) definitely have a horror theme to them and can get kinda creepy, but the most ive seen that is \\"satanic\\" is a couple of rock on hand signs.  not really that bad.<br /><br />but if you are a christian.  you do need to pay attention because the symbolism i have talked about is starting to be more in your face.  if you come across a new band and kind of like their music..  take my advise and watch some of their videos.  what you find may shock you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is fun, intertaining,non violent and addictive. what more could you ask for? Runs well enjoy it.  I could play it longer if I didn't run out of coins. But then I wouldn't get any thing done.
B000W93CHC|1.0|As a Follett fan (remember Eye of the Needle? or Pillars of the Earth?), and ignoring the poor reviews, I purchased this book. BIG MISTAKE!<br />It doesn't seem to be written by the same hand as the other books. From every perspective - literary, historical, research, language, you name it - the book is as close to worthless as a supposedly serious book can be.<br />The author - whoever it is - must have succumbed to the urgings of (non-literary) marketing types and decided to take the low road of sex, Sex, SEx, SEX and more SEX in an effort to reach the best-seller list. And, by George, there is hardly anything but sex in the book which, coupled with lots of gratuitous, gory violence fills a very large portion of the work.<br />At the outset, I intended to write a thoughtful, balance review of the book. However, World Without End is - forgive me, Mr. Follett - such a piece of trash, it does not merit the effort. English majors BEWARE!!<br />Highly disappointing!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|it's very rare for me to laugh so hard during a movie. it is big fun. recommend it to young and old.
0307744434|2.0|My two favorite things in a novel were missing in Night Circus: fascinating, three-dimensional characters and a riveting story.<br /><br />Her writing is good, the concept is amazing and the film sets are incredible.  Yes, film sets.  I'm still planning on watching it if this ever does get made into a movie.<br /><br />But there is not story -- or whatever story there is, it's watered down like tea from an over-used tea bag.  There was nothing quite alive about it.  It gave the feel of an eerily beautiful dollhouse -- something you could watch for hours, but nothing that ever came to life.<br /><br />The conflict never seemed to get me in the gut and the characters were nothing more than paper dolls to me.<br /><br />For over a year I thought I must be crazy.  Why are authors that I love and admire like Aimee Bender screaming and hollering that Night Circus is the hot, new thing?<br /><br />Granted the quality of writing is much higher than Harry Potter, but I had much more fun reading Harry Potter (despite the writing) than I did Night Circus.<br /><br />I was so excited, just waiting on the edge of my seat for the REAL conflict to begin, for the REAL faces of the characters to be revealed, but after 100, 200, 300 pages -- nothing happened.  Just winding around and around in circles so by the time there is a \\"final battle\\" I just really didn't much care.<br /><br />I do commend her as a WRITER and I just love, love, LOVE her personal story as to how she ended up getting published, so I'm sorry that Night Circus was not my cup of tea.<br /><br />She did teach me a lot, though, without meaning to.  A novel that large and lavishly built needs a plot to do all the beautifully intricate details justice.<br /><br />She'll get it right one day.  But until then, I'll keep my eyes peeled for the movie version.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Slow to begin with only 50 coins,  but stick with it.  I went from 50 to 3000 in a matter of days without buying any.  Feed the dozer 4 at a time for best results.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|An outstanding book that should be required reading for both students in basic economic classes in high school and college as well as the general public ....a must read for concerned citizens
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham writes my kind of book.  A mystery to the end--not a love story--not a historical novel,  but an up to date story about what could actually happen.<br />You can follow the places he talks about, see the airport, motel, town, etc.<br /><br />I ordered this book from Amazon for my Kindle before it came out in stores and it was delivered to my kindle when they promised.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very good book for kids.  Especially like the format of telling the story from different perspectives (characters).  definately a good book for elementary age kids
B009ZE27US|1.0|this app sucks it is a waste of space do not download it all it dose is pick a random number when you touch the screen
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Yes, this is a light read but that is fine with me because I read to relax.  I don't read to be critical of the author as if I have written the great American novel that has been on the best seller's list for months.<br />This story idea is not new but it is set in an interesting place and from an interesting point of view.  I read most of the book on flights to and from Oahu so perhaps I am partial to the book since it takes place on Oahu.  Is the plot predictable?  Sure - most books are.  Are the character's predictable?  Sure - who cares...this is fiction.  If you are looking for a good read that doesn't require indepth analysis to follow this is a great book.  Enjoy!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Have some favorite stations that I stream, but am not always able to sit at my computer -- with TuneIn Radio Pro on my Kindle Fire, now I can listen anywhere I have wifi!  HUGE selections of stations, stable.  Looking forward to being able to record my favorite shows for playback later as well.
0812993292|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry left me feeling in a quandry as to my overall rating. There were many slow pages where the journey seemed tedious . There were  too many blisters and foot plasters. There were many characters in the middle portion  who took away from the heart of Harold, Maureen and Queenie's story. All that being said, there was a beauty to the human story that transcended the flaws of the novel. Harold's story is heartwrenching  in that it shows  the long range  repercussions that can occur when a child is not wanted or loved by his parents. The dual journey that Harold and Maureen took  exemplify the fact that there are physical journey's that are life changing as well as emotional journeys that transform. Maureen never left her home but travelled as far as Harold did in her own way. The depth of pain and regret that filled these characters lives is  achingly told and the message that new beginnings are possible at any age is life affirming. The path of each person's life is peppered with fleeting aquaintances whose impact on another life may never be fully realized.It is a delicate human web that makes us who we are . Here Harold Fry opens our eyes. His story is a homage to friendship and love, to journeys that must be taken to salvage relatonships and to the  courage  and faith it takes to make that first  step in any difficult  endeavor. Because the humanity of this novel is so raw, real and strong  I feel it deserves a four star rating.

0316228532|3.0|J.K Rowling is a fantastic author from her Blockbuster hits with Harry Potter. This book wasn't too bad- FOR ADULTS ONLY. I am afraid parents might be mistaken with this author's previous childhood book series, and buy it for their kids. This book has very vulgar material in vivid detail relating to sex, drugs, and pedophiliia. Please read other reviews before make the choice to buy this for someone or someone underage!!! It needs a Rated R rating!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a truly outstanding movie with outstanding acting.  It is a must-see for anyone age 50+.  Funny and sad at the same time.  A movie for folks with open, adventurous minds.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|One of Rovio's best Angry Birds games yet.  The marrying of the two brands is carefully thought out and ends up creating a superior game as a result.  Haven't played the non-HD version for comparison but the visual are quite sharp on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Currently there are 2 worlds (Tatooine and Death Star) of 40 levels each with the teaser that a 3rd world (Hoth) is coming soon.  Each world has levels that are planet-bound (similar to Rovio's first 3 AB games) as well as space-bound levels (such as what was seen in Angry Birds Space).  One welcomed feature that was carried over from Angry Birds Space is the targeting line which gives an indication of how each bird will be leaving the slingshot.<br /><br />In addition, there is one pay world (Path of the Jedi) which also has 40 levels but costs an extra $1.99 at this point to unlock anything other than the first level.<br /><br />The other monetization feature in the game at the moment is the purchase of Millennium Falcon uses (something similar to the Mighty Eagle in Rovio's earlier AB games).  The game does dole out some free uses (I don't know the actual complete mechanic yet but it seems like the game gives you 5 free uses once you get 30 stars and an additional 5 free uses for every 20 stars after that) but it seems a little low personally.<br /><br />The only other down-side I've found so far is the lack of any real explanation of what the 'Path of the Jedi' is in-game (it's only description is \\"Are you ready for your Jedi Training? Land on Dagobah and forge a new lightsaber!\\").  For those curious, it is 40 levels that are suppose to be more difficult (similar to the Danger Zone in their Angry Birds Space game).  I, personally, found the description to be slightly misleading so I hope no one else gets fooled into thinking you're getting something more than you really are.
0393342212|5.0|This book seems to me as the rock of all rocks for parents with more than one kid! As I gave birth to our second son 5 months ago, it was recommended to me by a parenting trainer (together with two other books, which upon browsing didn't attract me as much as this one in writing style and alertness). The book has a few solid ideas, expressed in a simple manner. Each chapter has an explicit summary backed with examples and a few pages of cartoons to illustrate the ideas (the cartoons effectively clarified some questions that I had after reading the respective chapter). It is written in a pleasant way and I only wish it were longer and with more examples. Since I've read it, I feel confident that I will be able to manage both kids without making things worse between them and without favouring one over the other. I've already had good results in various instants: I don't scold the older one when he tends to aggress the baby, but instead protect and offer consolation to the baby; I don't interfere when the older one snatches toys from the baby's hands, but instead advise (not force) the older one to give the baby an exchange toy; I offer qualitative instead of quantitative attention to both kids (the older one reacted very well a couple of times when I put down the baby although he was fussing, to tend the older son because he was sick or hurt). The ideas that stick best to my mind are to avoid comparisons between the kids and avoid telling them that you love them equally.
1119962846|5.0|Executive summary<br /><br />Pretty much all I'd hoped for -- and I had high hopes.<br /><br />Significance<br /><br />The \\"Dummies\\" series is popular for introducing specific topics in an inviting way. R For Dummies is a worthy addition to the pack.<br /><br />There is a competitor by the name of Statistical Analysis with Excel For Dummies.  Now this may also be well-executed -- it probably is -- but some of us are of the opinion that the last two words of the title are redundant.<br /><br />There are millions of people doing data analysis in spreadsheets, even though spreadsheets are dangerous.  R For Dummies gives these people a reasonable entrance into the world of R where their analyses will be safer, faster and deeper -- after an admittedly uncomfortable period of adjustment.<br /><br />The world will be more productive on account of people switching from spreadsheets to R for data analysis.  The problem is that hardly any spreadsheet users are aware that there is a more comfortable way of living than walking along a cliff edge.  The cliff is invisible to them.  Hopefully R For Dummies will help change that by making R a more obvious alternative.<br /><br />Strengths<br /><br />Chapter 19 is \\"Ten Things You Can Do in R That You Would've Done in Microsoft Excel\\".  They resisted the subtitle \\"And by the way, generally much easier too\\".<br /><br />Writing introductions to computer programs is astoundingly hard.  A key problem is the curse of knowledge.  Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine not knowing.  So a writer who knows the program is not good, but a writer who doesn't know the program is no use as a navigator.  R For Dummies sails these stormy seas well, partly from the discipline of the \\"Dummies\\" template, partly from the skill of the authors.  They are competent in R yet both relatively new converts.<br /><br />The really important decisions when writing introductory documentation is what not to say.  I think Andrie and Joris made very goodselections for silence.<br /><br />... you discover the power hidden behind the 18th letter of the alphabet.<br /><br />Weaknesses<br /><br />There are (at least) two major styles of learning.  There are those (like me) who are perfectly happy to gather up detail after detail, and only eventually put the details into a big picture.  There are others who need to see the big picture before they can pick up any details (and possibly revise the picture).<br /><br />R For Dummies is probably closer to what the big-picture people need than any other R documentation I know, but I doubt it really fulfills the need.  However, that is probably too much to ask.  I think a separate (short) document is called for.<br /><br />If you're a big-picture learner, I'd be interested to hear what you think should go into such a document.<br /><br />Cool things I didn't know<br /><br />clipboard<br /><br />For Windows there is the writeClipboard function.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fun. is one of the best musical groups in the business, in my opinion.  This album is such a great work!  I love this one!  Thank you.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I love this author.  He has the best of imaginations, the writing is clear, crisp and positive.  I am now on book five of the series, and can't put them down.  I got my mother hooked on the books too.  I found her at two am still reading.  ENJOY ENJOY.  You will not regret reading a Terry Goodkind book.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Snow White and the Huntsman(released May/12)stars the likes of Kristen Stewart as Snow White,Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna,Chris Hemsworth as Eric the Huntsman,Sam Claflin as William,and Nick Frost(w/o Simon Pegg,wow!),Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane as part of a contingent of dwarves;hey,seeing is believing! This is NOT a retelling of the old fairy tale we all know from childhood.It is much darker and more violent,thus should not be viewed by persons under 14.Having that said,the film is a visual treat,but I found the going just a little slow until Snow White escapes her imprisonment and starts her long road back to restore the kingdom of her father with the help of the Huntsman.<br />The story finds a young Snow White without a mother,soon into the film.Later that day the King`s troops fight against a dark force of men,not of this world,as they disintegrate upon being struck.In the middle of this dark force is a barred wagon in which the King and his men find a beautiful woman,chained(Theron).The very next day she becomes wed to the King.In their bed that night she kills the King and instantly becomes Queen.The King's loyal subjects fight but it is no use and some,including a young boy friend of Snow White,William,flee the castle.Snow White herself is imprisoned in one of the castle towers for years as the Queen and her brother rule the Kingdom.<br />When Snow White becomes of age she finally manages to escape her captors and flees into the countryside.Guided by two birds she is led to a white horse which carries her far into a swamp,but is bogged down and can go no farther.The princess flees farther into the swamp/bog/forest where she finally collapses.Back at the castle a Hunstman is hired by the Queen to find the escaped princess.He tracks her down in short order,but something prevents him from releasing her to the Queen's brother.Instead he becomes her protector and they flee ever farther through the bogs and swamps and into the forest.It is there the Hunstman finally realizes who it is he is protecting,and they meet up with a band of dwarves,who pledge their allegiance to the princess.<br />In the meantime the princess's girlhood friend William,finds out she is still alive,and incognito,joins the Queen's brother and his men in the search for the princess.Back with the dwarves the princess and the Huntsman travel through an enchanted fairy forest where the princess comes face to face with a white reindeer with huge antlers.None of the dwarves have ever viewed this sight,and as the animal blesses the princess,an arrow flies straight into the reindeer,killing it.Some of the Queen's men have found them.In the ensuing battle revenge is made but one of the dwarves dies.The next morning the princess and William take a walk in the woods,talking.When the princess takes a bite out of an apple William gave her,she slips into a coma.The Queen has poisoned her and changes back into her normal body.The others come to her rescue but it is too late.William kisses her goodbye and she is taken to his fathers castle.There William instigates the men to up-rise and fight against the evil that rules the land.Before they ride the Huntsman visits the princess and also kisses her.After he leaves the princess slowly comes back to life and joins the troops outside.She inspires the men to fight alongside her and take back what is rightfully theirs.<br />A long and protracted battle takes place as the troops face many obstacles just to get into the castle.Once in,the princess inches her way along and travels the long and windy stairs to the Queens room.The two battle for supremacy.The princess is outclassed most of the way until,just as the Queen has her down and is about to take her heart,she quickly stabs the Queen in Her heart and kills her.The film ends as the princess,now Queen,finally reigns over the restored Kingdom.<br />Within the first part of the film that I earlier referenced that was slow in the building,there occurred some noticeable faux pauxs.When the princess finally escapes her room and locks the Queens brother in,we see her fleeing in one moment and then brother is suddenly in pursuit of her(how did he get out so quickly).Another such scene involves her escape to the outside of the castle walls through sewers and by jumping into the ocean.She finally comes upon a white horse and finally after all that time,the Queens troops are suddenly hot on her trail.And I watched the scar that the princess gave the Queens brother with a nail,come and go and change more than a few times.The editors weren't watching what they were doing.The film finally picks up after this as the princess escapes through the swamp/bog and meets up with the Hunstman.I actually became more emotionally involved at this point,which hadn't been the case up to this point.From here on the film builds upon itself and the inclusion of the dwarves was nice,as was the CGI involved to make normal men that size.The make up and wardrobe people are to be commended here for a job well done;with the changes in costumes and make up(Theron especially)from scene to scene,in some cases,it must have been a daunting task all around.The acting is generally solid,except for the very person the film revolves around Kristen Stewart.I thought she lacked the believability to convince me she had that all-so important inner strength that would propel her to become a Queen on her own.This I think is another reason the film was so slow to get off of the mark.Her credibility improved with the Hunstman on the scene,but he really just masked her deficiencies.<br />Technically speaking this DVD contains both the theatrical and extended versions of the film in their original w/s a/r of 2:35:1.The only extras are commentary and a featurette.<br />All in all,once you get past the slow start,this film starts to pick up quite well.The cast is a solid one,excepting the princess Stewart,who needs some improved acting chops and who was carried a good portion of the way by her co-stars.This is not a fairy tale for the small fry as it is violent and scary.3 1/2-4stars.aux pauxs.When the princess finally escapes her room and locks the Queens brother in,we see her fleeing in one moment and then brother is suddenly in

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story is fantastic as always. I love all his books. I wish Hollywood had not murdered the Lightning Thief the way it did, but they never do a book justice. All I want to know is when is the next one coming out, because I cannot wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome.  You will he shocked by how the book ends and u will want to start the third non right away.  It was better than the first book.
B007SGM084|4.0|I actually liked the plots of all 3 of these books even more than all of the sex. Don't let anyone fool you and say they aren't porn/erotica. Every chapter has at least one explicit sex scene. Fairly good reads though.
B009LUAR0I|5.0|I love Mika's music and this cd turned out to be amazing. Some of his best work to date. Don't think twice about buying it.
140053271X|5.0|This is perfect. Just like buying at the store. I like being able to read something without others judging what I'm reading!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I loved this music, it was great for kids and good for adults too, it was well made and a nice feel-good movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|amazing it is so fun. it inspirse me so must its just so amazing its just like the arcade every party place I go
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Where is free version?  Why can't Amazon offer the free version for Kindles? So we have to tolerate annoying ads. Android offers it.  Why can't we have it?
B008XG1X18|4.0|daily pinterest server errors are my only complaint. having the latest updates does not seem to help. very good app otherwise.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This book was really well written.  She made you really feel for each of the characters - even the ones you wanted to hate.  i think this is one of her better books
B00913DPW2|5.0|Entertaining, challenging and sometimes frustrating, The Haunt provides many hours of game play.  Individual puzzles are solvable (with patience), but the confusion of the multiple &quot;quests&quot; may require the walkthrough. Ex: you cannot pick up some objects or solve some puzzles until you are on that quest/tract.
B0000844I8|5.0|If for one reason or another you allow yourself an occasional diversion via \\"the arts,\\" you might want to pass through the \\"STARGATE\\" into an adventure filled with unexpected events.  The movie is fairly inoffensive entertainment (at least, I found it so) with some positive aspects that will get your mind off worries for awhile, and maybe you'll be gratified to see the good guys triumph over the bad guys.  The story is science fantasy.  It's depth and meaningfulness are on a par with SuperMan or SpiderMan movies.  It's a blatantly simple good versus evil theme, like in comic books.  But the role of Viveca Lindfors adds some dignity, and one thread of the story has more gratifying depth.<br /><br />The scenery, costumes, actors, and one animal are quite interesting.  (But I had a good laugh at how much this \\"wilderbeast\\" appeared to be propelled in some scenes by two people inside an animal costume!  --It was clearly a low-budget film, but was visually successful anyway.)  The plot is implausible and some details run by in rapid dialogue that's difficult to comprehend or grasp rationally, but you wouldn't expect a fantasy-adventure to be plausible.<br /><br />You'll come away from this movie with a new and entirely novel concept of the Egyptian god Ra.<br /><br />There are two male leads.  One is a young genius who is a linguist/interpreter with special knowledge of ancient hieroglyphics.  He has a lovely guilelessness, and he's the one whom audiences will feel most affection for.  The other male lead is a scary, angry, steely cold, military commander.  When I first saw him and heard him speak I felt such negative vibes coming from him that I thought, \\"I can't stand the bad feelings that this character radiates!  I'm gonna cut off this movie and forget about it!\\" I found I was able to bear with those initial extremely uncomfortable moments, though, and kept watching.  Colonel Jack and other members of the little military squad go through some changes before the storyends.  In the long run, I wasn't sorry that I continued to watch Colonel Jack closely, trying to figure out just what was going on inside his mind and heart.  I won't state any explicit details about the story because I think that a lot of the worth of experiencing this film lies in the surprises and unexpectedness in it.<br /><br />(I thought that the passages between worlds were deliberately depicted as similar in some respects to NDEs, but there was no extended metaphor intended.)<br /><br />For some people who care to view only super-serious filmatic material, this movie may seem like mostly an \\"empty show,\\" but I thought it served as a good, worthwhile diversion when that was exactly what I wanted and all that I had mental energy to deal with at the time that I chose to watch it.  I thought it was better than a football game, and better than the Startrek episodes that I occasionally watch for diversion.<br /><br />I'll remember the innocent-looking, lovable faces of the \\"slave people,\\" especially the young boys who play significant roles in the plot.  They were beautiful minor characters.<br /><br />(Seems like an unusual number of films I've seen begin amongst archaeological digs in the Egyptian desert c. 1930!)
0807014273|5.0|An Inspiring book, at the same time humbling. I have read this book 5 times and will continue to read it to remind myself of the essence of life and being and whenever I feel I have lost perspective in my life.<br />The new edition includes practice examples which are very illuminating.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|best tv show I've seen in years!  it truly has me hooked to the point I've been paying just so I can watch the next episode
B00992CF6W|4.0|all it needs is...bucket lava water MODS railroad PORTAL TO THE END nether aether,spawn eggs, MORE CLAY, and obsidian ingots.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Terrific acting and a very entertaining movie.  India plays a large role in the movie almost as a character in itself, which just ads to the flavor and enjoyment of this film.  This is a feel good, easy watch that is perfect for a Friday night at home or as an enjoyable escape on a long airplane flight.
0393339882|5.0|I do not write in capital letters. This tells you how much I sincerely enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I would agree with the summation of one who says that this is a boring book for the scientist, but it is a fantastic book for a historian! The character profiles of the scientists like Einstein and Borh, humanized them and hit home the thought that these men were more than just the equations they wrote. It was not a child's book, and was written at college level, but with a passion for the subject.<br /><br />Quantum Physics is still in its infantile stages. Everything is so unknown. Imagine Einstein or Gell-Mann in contemporary science with all the right equipment. It was only a theory to them. They spent plenty of time arguing over their theories, but it would take decades just to find some correlation.<br /><br />This book took a subject that was very alien to me, and made me feel at home in a wide-eyed way! I think this would be a good book for anyone who wants to see where it all started. Major kudos go to the Kumar the author for appreciating the fact that there are some of us that just want to know the juice behind the equation!!!!
B002W7J3SO|4.0|This movie is a classic.  It is like a window into that time period, which is fantastic. It works very well despite being slightly dated in its execution and acting - compared to today's standards.  It's a must see because it is a cornerstone that has influenced countless movies afterwards. I watched it on an airplane and it kept me engaged and entertained the entire time - that means it's a winner in my book.
0307949508|5.0|This book is the epitome of an addiction.  It starts out with some pangs of \\"wow did that just happen?\\" here and there but as you keep reading you feel shocked the entire time. It's almost like you know some things are bound to happen but you doubt yourself because that is just too crazy. It can't. Be.<br />If you haven't bought the book already I don't know what your doing with your life.
1402270275|5.0|From the very first pages, you enter a world that is both terrifying and exhilarating.  A place so vividly drawn you can practically hear the rustle of silk, feel the grime of smog laden air, and smell the acrid burn of a Spitfire's flames.<br /><br />Plot - Honoria, on the run with a large bounty on her head and two young siblings in tow, heads to the last place anyone would expect - the Whitechapel district.  With all of London under the control of the Echelon Blue Bloods, Whitechapel is a place of last resort - a place of Slasher gangs, soul-crushing poverty, and crime of nightmarish proportions.  A place so terrifying that the villainous Duke of Vickers, a monster hiding his own dark secret, might not enter in pursuit.  Intent on revenge and reacquiring research diaries that may hold a key to curing the Blue Blood virus, Vickers will go to any lengths to get what he wants.<br /><br />Heroine - Honoria Todd is a wonderful character - fiercely independent, strong, and intelligent she has the weight of the world on her small shoulders - at the very least the survival of her younger brother Charlie and sister Lena.  Without resources or even valid papers, her prospects for respectable work are slim and finally gone.  Her agony over the plight her young siblings now find themselves - especially the sickened Charlie - is heartbreaking and genuine.  Her previous lifestyle, though filled with work, had plenty of the finer things in life; clothes, comfortable home and food.  A starving Honoria wonders now if her very life is over when summoned to meet the beast, the devil of Whitechapel - Blade.<br /><br />Hero - Blade, a rogue Blue Blood is a charismatic enigma.  An agonizing past filled with torture, pain and anger, he's a tormented soul that cries out for all the things of a man; work, a family, home, a woman to love.  With all the strength, speed, and cunning intelligence of a predator, Blade is an alpha male to the core and now finds a chance to exact revenge against the man who stole his dreams and destroyed his life - the Duke of Vickers.<br /><br />Romance - began as a slow, smoldering sexual tension that simmered until it erupted into a fireball of passion.  Fighting his own nature and struggling with bouts of rabid jealousy of any male that comes close to Honoria, Blade goes all out to capture her heart.  Having spent a lifetime watching the cat and mouse games that Blue Bloods play, Honoria has no trust nor could put any faith in a Blue Blood.  Blade uses kindness, patience and understanding in a slow dance of seduction that tears through her fear and mistrust.  The love Blade has for his ragtag family is evident and goes a long way in showing Honoria the man he is at heart.<br /><br />I was sorry to leave this place and these people.  I happily look forward to the next book which features Will and perhaps a peak into Blade and Honoria's newfound happiness.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys heart pounding adventure and swoon worthy romance.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Got this today and I have to say, this is a pretty amazing box set to have.  You get all the Columbia era albums from the debut up through Imaginos plus two discs of rarities and collected tracks from radio broadcasts.<br /><br />There's been some comments about the download site not working.  A few people (myself included) have inquired about this on Eric Bloom's Facebook page and the issue seems to be temporary.  We've been assured that it's being worked on so my advice would be to hold on to the insert with the download code and keep trying or checking back.<br /><br />Back to the music.  The first four albums, Spectres, and Some Enchanted Evening contain the same expanded content from Sony's prior reissues.  On Your Feet..., Mirrors, and everything forward of that has been newly mastered.  Like another reviewer here has said, I will agree and advise to keep your original Sony remastered releases if you want to retain the liner notes, pictures, etc., because the cardboard album sleeve replicas here mostly just replicate the front and back covers and gatefolds when applicable.  The booklet contains a short essay by Lenny Kaye and some great photos and all the song credits.  No lyrics.  So if you want to keep the originals for the liner notes and pics, I'd say keep them but if you're looking to economize, you won't lose the music / video content.<br /><br />It's a great set and if you've been away from the catalog for awhile or are maybe just starting to fall in love with the music, it doesn't get any more complete than this.  BOC - amazing, and hopefully on tour forever!<br /><br />**edit** - as of today, 11/09/12, the download site is live.  Good to go!
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Well since I fell asleep not once but twice watching it... But worse, I thought with Amazon I had 24 or 48 hours to watch it but when I re-loaded it to see the ending when I woke up, Amazon charged me a second time. Maybe I didn't miss much but Amazon lost a good customer.
