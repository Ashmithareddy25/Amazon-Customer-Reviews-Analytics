B001NLL93W|5.0|This series of books are great, Once you start with one you will get hooked and can't wait to read the next one
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game makes us think and get frustrated all at once....fantastic game! Fun to play and talk to the many friends that play it too!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I got this for free as the free app of the day and it is easily one of the more entertaining games I've found on a mobile device.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Not as complex as his earlier works, and this cd is brief by comparison. but his wonderful expressive lyrics are there, the more I listen to it, I find I like it more & more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Man, the game is great. Unlimited hours of running and u become an addict. 5 on 5. New versions keep coming , each one better than previous.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I have been a Dylan fan since 75 and i have seen him ever changing that's what i like about him and this is no exception and  i think his voice now fit's this style of music he's  doing. He never fails to amaze me. great album.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app is awesome.  I am sorry that it took me this long to review it and that so many things have changed.<br /><br />Originally this app allowed you to access your computer from anywhere as long as you were running the software.  They have since released a new app and have changed their pricing structure.  Kind of disheartening, but I understand.  It doesn't take away from how awesome this app is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have the Candy Crush Saga app for my smartphone and was a bit disappointed when I found that it wasn't available for my Kindle.  No more disappointment here!  The app is glorious and my addiction lives on.  Woo!
B00AATFJK2|4.0|Westworld has always been a favorite of mine since the first time I viewed it on the big screen when it was first released.<br />I re-discovered this gem when I found it on dvd.<br />Now to see it on Blu-ray has made viewing it a pleasure to watch it all over again.<br />A great addition to my movie collection!
B002MW50KO|5.0|Wow i think this is just great Bob Dylan doing a Christmas Album! what's not to like? Being a Dylan fan since 75 i like this so his voice isn't what it was before so what? It's Dylan and he's faithful to the arraignments too. God bless him.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love SwitfKey.  Having said that.... I don't use it anymore.<br /><br />Thankfully the default Android keyboard has evolved and I no longer use SwiftKey like I used to.  I still enjoy the app, but I just don't rely on it anymore.  The app is great and the fact that they are merging the regular and tablet app soon is very exciting.  Some of the prediction stuff is creepy, especially considering how much it knows about me and how often it sees my typing.  I am a very rapid typer and even with the appropriate settings I ran into some small issues.<br /><br />I would recommend this keyboard to anyone transitioning to a smartphone or that is coming from a phone with a keyboard to a touch screen.  Seriously great app, however I think it is a much better teaching tool than daily driver.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|This is my second Lego watch - for myself,not my grand children.  Every time I wear it, I get  a comment.  And - it really keeps good time on top of being fun to wear.  I wore the last one for a couple years until it died, but couldn't get a new one because Lego had discontinued.  So glad they brought it back!
140006922X|1.0|While I am neither a historian, nor a biblical scholar, it appears I share that with the author of this book. The author has a point of view and to support it, he tends to ignore sources that would disagree or contradict his theories. He tends to \\"cherry pick\\"  those pieces of Scripture that advance his position, while he dismisses those that do not.<br /><br />Some reviewers find that his writing style makes the topic accessible to all readers, but some of the narrative he weaves has no basis in any historical documents. For one example, in the prologue to Part III, he gives us several paragraphs of detailed background on Stephen, the first Christian martyr. Among other things, he tells this that Stephen never met Jesus, was not in Jerusalem to welcome Jesus, and in fact did not hear about Jesus until after his crucifixion. Since there are no documents other than the Scriptures themselves which reference Stephen, where did the author learn all of these interesting facts?<br /><br />I do have to admit that I learned quite a bit while reading this book, but it was not from this book. I learned a lot because this author's regular use of emotionally charged words without cause, poorly documented and one-sided scholarly references and  questionable use of Scripture, caused me to turn to my local library. It was there that I was able to find works that spoke to both sides of some of the issues where this author showed only one. In other cases, I was not able to find anything at all to support his assertions.<br /><br />In the end, I am very sorry that I paid money to buy a copy of this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. Simple rules but challenging. After I use up all my hearts I get up and do some chores while I wait for them to reboot! Addictive!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game for quite some time on Facebook and my iPhone. I kept wondering when it was going to be available for my Kindle Fire HD. Finally it's here :) Happy happy joy joy! Thank you, King, for finally making it available for us Kindle addicts.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|characters didn't seem to have the sharp instincts in deducing the facts of the storyline - seemed a bit amateurish.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very interesting to read something written from another point of view.  It's not supposed to be the 'be all and end all' of the story of Christ, just another view.  What it does is make you think and reread the Bible. You are also able to see what was going on in the rest of the world at that time and tie it into the stories you already know from the Bible.  It helps you see things in more depth and from a different perspective. All in all, it's a very interesting read.
1408803011|4.0|The characters described are interesting and I can't wait to see how J.K. Rowling presents them on the screen since she's talking about many beasts as characters for the movie.
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|Want to know how to get shit done? Crack it open. You'll see how others do it successfully... and when I say others, I mean friends, peers, colleagues and competitors.
B00D8HNR5W|4.0|I always liked Nine Inch Nails, Downward Spiral, and Further Down being my favorites, but this one is as good as any.  It is a little more on the electronica side of style but an excellent album. I do like the soundtracks of The Social Network better as someone who likes instumentals but if you like Reznor singing buy this album....very solid.
014241722X|4.0|Concise Guide to Jazz: the book is excellent but there were supposed to be CD's that are referred to accompanying the chapters that were not included in the delivery.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Works great for regular use use it to wake up has a loud alarm wish free use had more options.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|My middle-school daughter read this and talked me into reading it too.  We both thoroughly enjoyed it, and are very anxious for the next book to be released.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|\\"Oh my! Oh my!\\" What is that clich&eacute;? \\"Better late than never\\" I am certainly glad that I am just late. \\"The Game of Thrones\\" is an astounding, impressive, and brilliant masterpiece of fantasy! I just finished \\" A Song and Ice and Fire\\" and have already worked my way into \\"A Clash of the Kings.\\" George R.R. Martin takes you on a great escape to a whole new world. His story telling is brilliant! My favorite character at the moment would have to be Arya; she is my little rebel girl! She has a strong mind and body with a stronger will. I can't wait to see where the story takes her. I would have to say that this is a brutal, emotionally raw fantasy world that is not intended for the light hearted. I would highly recommend this escape to the world Mr. Martin has created.<br /><br />Update: Finished the 4 book bundle and I am so hooked! Still wanting more. I also have watched the HBO series. There is enough differences in the books from the show, that I would highly recommend that you read the books! Just Fantastic!
0316074314|2.0|This book was released on the day it won the Booker. What a coincidence. I started reading immediately;I'm 27% through! and I'm having a hard time continuing. The pseudo-Victorian prose style  may be admirable to some, but I find it extremely tedious. The plotting is very simple,yet the telling is convoluted. I feel like I'm reading and reading at yet the story is going nowhere. I don't think I can make it through to the end. Maybe the award was given for style, not for substance. I am so disappointed. I hate to give up, yet I don't want to waste my time and feel like a chump. But at this point I just don't think this is a very good book.<br />Now it's November  10 and I've finished; I have to admit I did come to admire this rambling historical yarn. I'm still not sure I agree it deserves such a prestigious prize, but I don't think it was totally wasted time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg ive been waiting for the app for the longest :D I'm in level 92 and i can't wait to keep playing ^.^
0143122010|5.0|Probably the most interesting book I've ever read.  It can be a bit dense at times (but its complex argument requires lots of data).  It is written in an easy to understand way!<br /><br />I own the paperback version and i wish the font was just a little bit larger (this probably wont bother most people).
B003TOMAPC|3.0|it was quite a surprise. it was good to spend Friday afternoon with my kids lots of killing for sure very graphic son didn't like that the KICK -ASS guy didn't know how to fight.
B00G24KKAS|1.0|MAKE IT STOP BUFFERING!!!!! dont even bother saying its my connection, netflix is streaming just fine. hit them up and use their format or something, its not like amazon doesnt have the money to afford it... SINCE IM PAYING FOR THIS ANYWAYS
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game helps me pass time while doing home care. And my pt likes playing it also. I have shown a lot of people this game. I like that you don't need points to play like in other games.
B005L38QK2|5.0|its smooth and easy to use the lights are awesome and the decal is amazing cant wait to use it.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|With out a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is truly touching and the acting is amazing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well-  I feel that this is a novel that should be read by most!! It goes beyond-you'll see.  This is also a book that  most can relate to!  It will take you to a different level of defense so read it and see!!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Great game to get full version tap a locked item it will say if you want to<br />Get full version say yes you pay with 3 dollars or coins then it down<br />Loads super fast there you go
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It's loads slow,doesn't send messages without me deleting them,sometimes won't notify me if I have a message, friend request and notifications. It's just slow !
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played for 3 years now. Now I have my sister and mom playing too! We are all Addicted!! Love this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like this game and was disappointed when I found out it wasn't available for the kindle. Now that it is I'm not so disappointed and I can continue playing one of my favorite games
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a novel that I can say I enjoyed quite a bit.  I can say that there was more substance to it than I expected.  The characters felt very real to me.
B00C5R8364|3.0|Somehow I expected more from Forsyth. The story is interesting but quickly became predictable with few plot twists. Perhaps the time has come for Forsyth to retire.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|just as exciting as when I saw it in the theater.  My nephew loves Indiana Jones and was thrilled to get his own copy.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I've read a lot of romance books in the past and this one will go down as one of my favorites.<br />First, there is no sequel. (Clapping out loud!)<br />Second, the point of view from a guy and the narrative the author writes it in is fantastic!<br />Third, it had me laughing out loud and heating up too.<br />Definite must read!!
B00FEN000S|5.0|I guess I am biased... because I am an absolute Sci Fi fanatic, especially with giant robots fighting giant aliens/monsters.<br /><br />If each element of the movie is isolated and reviewed separately, I'd say they are only \\"good\\" except for the visuals which I thought were outstanding. The costumes, sets, and CGI are amazing especially when you see the scale of the Jaegers and Kaiju with respect to skyscrapers and typical city environments. The story is your typical Japanese mecha anime, but the actors helped make the story more interesting.<br /><br />Overall 5/5 stars. I cannot wait for a sequel!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|At first my draw to this show was the lead actor David Tennant. After watching the first episode I knew that it would be unlike anything I could picture him in; it was better. Broadchurch is a small town which lives off of the tourism it receives from its beautiful coast. In this show it delves into the secret lives of the townspeople as the lead detective Alec Hardy(Tennant) and Ellie Miller search for the killer of a young boy. Throughout the investication the most important lesson Det. Hardy is trying to instill in his the rookie Det. Miller is that no one can be trusted. Anyone she knows is capable of  murder. This is a hard pill to swallow for a woman investigating a death in her own hometown. In the end neither she nor you, as the viewer, see the end coming. Overall a well produced show with many twists and turns.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't know how to describe it, but its not a super fun game, yet you just keep wanting to play some more. It's one of those &quot;just one more level&quot; games.
1616550414|5.0|An excellent book for any Zelda fans!! Give you the most in-debt view and explanation of the whole Zelda franchise
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My mom plays all the time and I ask and she says no so I can now play. So Happy
B004EF65QA|5.0|Great story.  I have watched this many times before and never get tired of it! Thank you very much Amazon Prime!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The husband's secret was a difficult read for me.  The first chapter was great as was the last chapter.  The other chapters seemed to venture a little too far away from the main theme to suit my tastes.  I found it difficult to keep my attention on certain parts of the book. In fairness to the author it was an interesting book to read and did keep you wondering to the end just what the husband's secret was.  I just found it difficult to keep up with all the characters.  I'm not an avid reader so take my comments as coming from a novice in the world of fictional reading.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|If you are into Zombie movies then pick this up. The Zombies in this movie are relentless and nice special effects
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|First off, I'll review the Deluxe Edition. The normal review is below.<br /><br />The Deluxe version is pretty lackluster in my opinion. The artwork style, booklet and hardcover case are pretty cool, but the bonus disc is just a couple boring remixes. It would have been much cooler to include the audiophile mix that Trent released on the website as a download. I later found out after purchasing that the vinyl edition comes with a cd of the album and only costs $23 at Hot Topic, which is totally worth the extra $9.<br /><br />Trent basically phoned this one, and that's the best and worst thing about this album. I've never heard a NIN album (aside from GHOSTS which to me is unused ideas) that wasn't great. Every song on here is very catchy, along with some that are becoming my favorite tracks (All Time Low, Satellite, Copy of A), but overall he does nothing new. It sounds largely like a continuation of Downward Spiral, which in my opinion was the weakest NIN album. If that was your favorite, you'd love this album.<br /><br />I've seen them on the Tension tour where they've performed 7 of the songs from this album and it sounds incredible with a live setup. It's a shame he went backwards on this album doing largely everything himself instead of collaborating with other musicians like he did on his last 3 albums.
039916409X|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:1452574073 Guide to Healing Chronic Pain: A Holistic Approach]], I've advocated the use of EFT to release Emotional Baggage to help relieve the emotional aspects that perpetuate chronic pain.  In this ground-breaking work, Margaret Lynch goes deeper than T. Harv Eker [[ASIN:0060763280 Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth]] to release the old programming so many of us have that keep us in scarcity and debt.  Both Margaret's Secrets of Intentional Wealth and 7 Levels of Wealth Manifestation Courses are superb and they have changed my life in a very positive way.  I love how this book has tons of tapping scripts and accompanying video training.  What a great value! If you're into EFT and manifesting financial abundance, then this book is for you. Bravo Margaret!
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Very good went to understanding lil to knowing more.<br />I find this is more Latin American not castillian. some similar but very helpful
0439023521|5.0|My son needed it for a school project. He liked it, so I'm happy. The shipment was on time and book was in excellent condition.  Thanks!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great purchase. Bought this to replace a lost CD. If you are a Garth Brooks fan there is not too much to say. Nice selection of all the hits and a few songs that were never released. This would also be a good one for any country fan.
B001QWBM62|3.0|I was very happy with my Zoom H4n at first, until I tried to record an entire musical performance.  It stopped recording after 42 minutes in the middle of a song.  Plenty of room left on the 8GB SD card.  On AC power. It consistently just stops recording after 25-45 minutes.<br /><br />I will continue to use it for recording short sound effects, but I am very disappointed that I cannot make long recordings.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Add mecha. Giant alien dinosaurs. Crazy explosions. ALL OF THE FEELS.<br /><br />Bring popcorn. Leave understanding of physics at the door.<br /><br />CAUTION!! Over the top gags (come on, a Newton's cradle?) - BLEND everything together for perfect monster movie!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001UE27X8|2.0|Yes, they were both great and at near their heights (Bennett maybe a few years shy); but they were very different musicians with very different styles and tastes. Second only to Coltrane, Evans was a breakaway envelop pusher, but Bennett was one of the last of the great  balladeers of the late 40's and 50's. The set consists of tradeoffs rather than togethers.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|the plot is obtuse, good special effects tho, i dont think i would recommend this movie to anyone, not a fav of mine
B002GYS1FO|5.0|There are some great songs on here - bold, beat heavy, and the lyrics are evocative. I've seen them live twice now, and their intense energy and charisma are captured on this album.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The quality of this device is dependent on your cell phone and internet provider.  Response times seem to be slow with Comcast plus my IPhone4, and with only Netflix - assuming you have a subscription - and You-Tube participating, you're not getting much. But then, you're not paying much. Slick packaging.
B00FPGV3RS|4.0|It doesn't take itself to seriously and neither did I. Pretty funny and loaded with action and special effects I enjoyed it.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|It was so UN-realistic. The graphics didn't look real at all but it was kinda fun but too bad no multiplayer.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Unlike a lot of books I read, these are two people I could picture myself hanging out with.  They were funny and real.  And who doesn't want to fall in love with their best friend.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I would have like it to be a bit longer.  At the price, you will not be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Don't know what makes this game so great. I mean it's fun and all but not more so than others. It had cute graphics but not great. It is somewhat challenging and kills time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush finally on kindle! Works wonderfully and is beautiful, smooth running now I can join my friends to play<br />Thanks Amazon
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I liked this book because it's written from the perspective of death, telling this story. The WW II setting has been an addiction of mind lately and this was one worth reading.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I tried it out because if was on syfy - fell in love with it because of the characters - and stayed with it because of the complex storytelling.  Highly recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the book!!!!!!!<br />And on page 29 the book says Dany  NOT  Many!? I liked your book!! Have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!( :  : )
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I am satisfied. It is not as sophisticated as the word processor on my laptop but it is sufficient and I'm glad I got it. Good price too!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really liked this book and the ending is a thought provoking one. I would recommend this book - the story all comes together.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this book very intriguing and engaging throughout.  I will recommend this to my friends and read more by this author.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics. Look forward to playing more and more. Super easy to get started and get your first kills. Hope it gets tougher.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|Good Story, beautiful scenery!  It reminded me a lot of &#34;Sleeping With the Enemy&#34;  The ending really caught me by surprise!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|The music goes up another notch. From rocking riffs  to Ballads to explorong the sounds of orchestration tells the songs are from the heart. Looking forward to seeing and listening to to Dream Theater on this upcoming tour. Rock in Atlanta!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Streaming is not as expected. If you are looking for a wireless hdmi device, this is NOT the product you are looking for.<br />As well, if you are looking for an android set-top-box, not your device either.<br />It needs a power supply (usb) and it is easy to configure. For the price, it is a bargain, but don't expect great things. The screen definition is not the best you can get. 1080p is a mirage and it DOESN'T work with Android devices (WTF!). You still need to operate it from a Win/Mac pc.<br />Said the above, looking at youtube or any other streaming website, is acceptable. When a streaming starts, looks like from your main pc you can still do other things and let the TV keep playing. However, I would rather buy an HDMI wireless device and get benefit of using any other OS and device. From a mobile it is impossible to be used as you don't have a support for Chrome.<br /><br />Google needs to start having internal discussions and collaborations between its teams. How this device is not talking with Chrome for Android and Android itself, is a pity and a poor project deliverty execution.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lots of fun but gets harder than you might think. at first, I tried to get three stars on each level. didn't take long for me to give up on that and just try to pass each level. I do however HATE having to wait for lives to renew...
031623480X|5.0|Dr. Perlmutter`s expertise and courage is next to nothing in health care issues. This is a book to anyone, who is open-minded and ready to admit that theories about causes of illnesses have not been and are not always spot on. This book is a remarkable piece of critical information about the real causes of many disastrous health problems.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read the reviews before purchasing and was afraid this would disappoint.  I was very pleased when it did not.  King has always written deep characters with flaws and this is no different.  I judge a book on my resistance to put it down, and this one was very tough to put down.
0810993139|4.0|picked up for grand son... price is good, shipped promptly<br />cute series , quick turn around , book well made,<br />children seem to enjoy the series
B000BDLJBU|4.0|Very hard to solder, but works well.  If you are looking for a great product that works good, for the right price, this is the one for you.  A great buy!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|4 stars!<br />The movie quality was great in my ipad never flickerd or had any disruption issues.<br />I'm very happy with my prime subscription
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great fun.  Addicting.  Worth playing.  Down side is you can't exchange bananas for coins and there is limited way to earn coins without buying them.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome....I have to stop myself sometimes because it is so addictive...this game is wonderful and very pleasant.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book! I really enjoyed the Percy Jackson series and now finds self immersed in the Heroes of Olympus series and am thoroughly enjoying it. The mark of Athena is a quick read and a good adventure!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been waiting for this book a long, long time. As a member of the SKLibrary I get his stories almost as soon as they come out. I have 38 of his books on ereaders. This one hasn't disappointed me either.
1419702238|4.0|picked up for grand son... price is good, shipped promptly<br />cute series , quick turn around , book well made,<br />children seem to enjoy the series
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Ryan is a true storyteller and i couldnt put the book down even though its a long read.  He telegraphs some, but also has enough mystery to have you wanting more.  Id put him in line with rothfuss and brian sanderson, fantasy on an epic scale that leaves little to the imagination because its just that good.  Very happy i bought this book and will probably read everything else he has because of it.
B00A83075M|5.0|My 6 year old loves this movie.  It is really cute and shows that anyone can be a hero.  I also has a lot of action.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|I love the simple interface and the challenge of the puzzle. the puzzles get harder but are all brilliantly solvable.  the way it all comes together is really elegant in spite of the simple graphics. more levels please!!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Really reliable I use it everyday...great for various occasions and multi tasks. This is the best alarm clock app I've ever used
B009CQMZ6K|2.0|Let's say it doesn't work. And it was a waste of an order and time of wait. I was expecting it to. Stick or have suction . It doesnt
B007PVHANM|5.0|Thankyou so much for delivering my product very quickly. We enjoy the story line of this and watch this very often.<br /><br />Extremely pleased and will be purchasing from you again.<br /><br />Thanks again!

0738212415|4.0|I don't care to read page after page, but this book captured my attention.  I began to look at everyday things in a different way.  How does the light hit it?  Where are my shades and angles?  Very nicely done!  I started drawing the first day I received the book.
B0052GACNM|5.0|WOW!!!!  Thats putting it lightly.  What a wonderful performance by him and all the &#34;greats&#34; that sang with him.  I've bought several copies of this DVD/CD for myself and several of my friends.  It makes a wonderful gift for anyone of any age.  He's just a perfect entertainer.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. Very entertaining and perfect for people who like hidden object games. Considering there are different options in search mode you do not get bord easily and your energy keeps restoring so you can play without spending any money.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I love zombies. I do not like de end. good diversion with pop corn. The extended version is better. i liked
0763660531|5.0|I think I was more enthralled by this book than my granddaughters. It is a lovely story, beautifully illustrated and held a really nice message about family & friends & imagination. I simply think it was a bit too above a 3 & 5 year olds interest. It wasn't a book they asked to have read over & over like some of the word books I've chosen. Notice I said 'READ', they simply prefer word books. I hope it will grow with them however.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Imagine the musical prodigy child of Nick Drake and the Cocteau Twins recording in the 21st Century with John Barry and Steve Reich doing the string arrangements...Awesome!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent series. Great casting and storyline! David Tennant is wonderful as always and the mother of the little boy was excellent!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Game is fun. Great addition to all my other bubble games. Very addictive. Also great entertainment for the kids on car rides.
0399255370|5.0|My granddaughters (ages 3 & 5) would not stop asking for this book when I gave it to them. And it was a book I enjoyed reading to them. It really was a fun read done in an imaginative format that didn't bore me one bit. Even after the 10th reading... in one day!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loads of fun and addictive.  Enjoy playing but dislike the levels that are impossible to win.  Hard to stop a bomb when there are no colors of the same anywhere around to stop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it best app I downloaded in a long time...I recommend this to any one who has a lot if time on there hands
0375847227|3.0|I never saw the movie The Golden Compass.  I read the uproar regarding it.  I thought I would read the trilogy.  The Subtle Knife was the best of the lot and that is not saying much.  I am sure there is some anti-religious message in it but I really didn't see it.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|This is the favorite movie of my 3 yr old son... so when the one we had got broken we need to buy a replacement. So this is a must in our Movie Collection
1476712042|2.0|Travis and Abby are a very disfunctional couple, their relationship is complicated and obsessive. They have absolutely no charisma, she makes lots of stupid decisions during the story. Love scenes are very poorly described and the couple is so neurotic it's difficult to get attached to them. I hardly made it to the end of the book, not a very pleasant reading, I do not understand all the 5 stars the book got.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you like it on your pc you'll love it on your Fire. And you don't even need boarding passes!!!
0765325950|5.0|I could not put this book down.  From the first page to the last you are hooked.  Granted there are some deaths I wish did not happen and there some that lived that disappointed me but it was true to Robert Jordan and his vision.  The fighting fierce but the results miraculous.  There were some loose ends left hanging.  Perrin and Faile what is there future/  Login is he truly now a hero? Will men and women finally be able to use the force harmoniously together or will eny again raise its ugly head?  I really wish the saga could continue.  But end it must and this was a fitting end to a fantastic journey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the grafects espesily when the horse jumps it looks so real and the paddock looks so real to
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Clever and humorous. Cline doesn't leave out a single memory of computer history, games, movies. Had me chuckling, frequently. Fun!
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Nothing against the movie, but the quality of this copy!  The Blue-ray copy is defective, stopping every few seconds after the first 35 minutes.  The dialogues don't go with the scenes and it's impossible to watch.  I can't return it now, as I am abroad.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an amazing woman and an amazing story.  If you deal with any one who is autistic, this is a must see.<br /> If you don't have a personal contact, her story will help you grow and learn about other people and how they see<br />their world.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|This is one of the better movies that I have seen this year. The lead role of Captain Phillips is played by Tom Hanks. The shipping company's name is<br />Maersk.

The United States has had no success in stopping the hijacking. The first day out they are accosted by a Somali pirating attempt. The pirates<br />are unsuccessful. On the second day the Somali bandits make a successful attempt. After many attempts at evasion the Somali pirates are successful in<br />boarding the ship. Captain Phillips manages to hide most of his crew within the ship. The pirates ,while searching the ship have their leader captured by the ship's crew. After the negoiation process the Somali pirates agree to leave the ship on a lifeboat. The pirates take the captain with them. The pirates<br />make an attempt to reach Somalia. In the meantime the United States has called the Navy Seals into action. The pirates have issued a ten million dollar ransom for Captain Phillips. Eventually the Navy Seals are able to conduct  a rescue effort. Captain Phillips is safely rescued. This is a tremendous<br />movie that you should not miss.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS AMAZING!!!!! I'm only 11 but this game is amazing it's really fun moms and dads out there if your child wants this game get if for them it amazing.<br />At first I was a bit bored but as soon as I got in depth with it and playing it more often I am hooked. I gave this game 5 stars because I clearly believe minecraft deserves it
B0041T4ML4|4.0|Very different from most offerings in the genre. Good, too! Will capture your attention & provide an enjoyable read<br /> Well worth trying.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love this game became better at piano bcuz of it. now I wish I would become a better spealler.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I'm waiting for Jennifer Lawrence to have her Lindsay Lohan moment, but fortunately she hasn't gone there, yet.  I don't like Cooper's character at all, but Lawrence plays Tiffany brilliantly.  Great film.  Love the dancing.
B004NS710C|4.0|Good movie about heroes and relationships that make life meaningful. This movie never lacked for excitement and ended with the right side up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice game. Graphics are good and simple. The challenges a person to search for items to either open to find tools or pass codes to solve puzzles. Great time passer and ready for more levels
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it is totally better than the last one you should get it but if you are inpatiant don't get it because the bosses are hard and it takes a long time to get coins.
B008133JZG|5.0|I waited a long time to watch this series.  When I finally did, I watched all the episodes available on prime in two days and I'm itching to get more.  When will season 3 be available?  I'll count the days.  I am very choosy about my programing since I don't have a lot of time for it.  Sherlock has made me miss two days of work because I couldn't get enough.  It's smart, fast paced and compelling.  The acting is absolutely fantastic.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a very believable, emotion provoking and fun to watch pair as Holmes and Watson.  You don't even need to be a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories to be able to latch on this just plain excellent series, but being a fan of the cannon you cannot help but appreciate how artfully it has been done.  I am SHER locked.
0811836363|4.0|The Beatles Anthology by The Beatles is a mind blowing book for anyone and not just for die hard Beatle fans. This book will be an appealing read for anyone who wants to start up a band, learn about the history of the iconic band the Beatles, or learn about the history of rock and roll.<br />  The Beatles Anthology is a very big book (in both size and content) full of personal thoughts and feelings from everyone involved in the band in their own words. There is images and pictures on almost every page and some of the pictures are rare and from personal collections. The book starts out with each member telling the reader about their childhood and what they did before joining the Beatles. Then the book goes through all the historical events of the band in historical order, with everyone involved telling their personal take on what happened and how it affected them. You get to read what John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Brian Epstein (the Beatles manager), George Martin (the Beatles producer), and everyone else who was involved was effected or what they thought about the event.<br />  If it wasn't for the book being so amazing and having so much personal information I would have rated this book a lot lower than four stars. The only reason I gave this book four stars and not five is because I bought a brand new version of this book for a History of the Beatles class that I am taking for school and it did not arrive new. The binding of the book was completely unglued and that was causing the spine of the book to fall apart in some areas, the front and back cover of the book was bent and scratched up, and it smelt like the book belonged to a smoker who was smoking while they read the entire book. I would have returned this book immediately but, I needed it for the class and to catch up on reading that I was already behind on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well I have to say that this is the best game I have ever gotten on my Kindle I mean people have to buy this my friend told me to and it is AWESOMELY AMAZING!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!just got it on the Xbox tooooo I recommend this game for anyone under 5
055358894X|4.0|Fun book but I wasn't sure if I should give it a 4 or a 5... I would give a 4.5. It was fun but not as deep as it could be... However much I like Locke his escapades seem more like 'escapades' and less like parts of the story. I did like the way Lynch laid out his mysteries, in the most practical way some of them are solved that way as well. The double story line (while not as original as other reviewers are raving it is) also added a lot to it.<br />A pretty good book all in all; doesn't have me raring for the next one but it was compelling enough that I'm going to read the next one eventually.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|ugh, part of me says 'don't download this' and the other part of me news to go start another game. Best game I have on my kindle.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I can't get it to cleanly cut anything. It was very frustrating and I wasted several glass bottles as well as my money.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app. great info. looks good and works really well! the estimates on consumption rates are very helpful. good job!
1440503257|5.0|My sister got this from the library once and since then has been pining for it. My mother at last decided to buy it for her and she's thrilled! As an Ashkenazic Jew my family's cuisine doesn't vary much- lots of noodles and potatoes for us, thank you very much- and this cookbook is an adorable and delicious shock! Dinah formatted it in a unique way that's great for any Harry Potter lover (it's always nice to feel like you're living your favorite book) and that makes it a great book to cook from and even (if you're bored) just to look through for fun and informative facts.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Normally a slow reader but i read all three in approx 2 weeks. Loved the survivalist details. Rich in detail and story.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fantastic read!!  It was so nice to find Danny all grown up & learn what he'd been up to for all these years. Thanks Mr. King!!!!
B00333NCTM|5.0|I loved it! Here's your chance to read Ozzy's version of his story. Very literate, well written and hilarious! I don't often laugh out loud at something I read, but several times my wife asked me what was so funny. If you have any interest in Black Sabbath or Ozzy, don't miss this book.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! It made my mom cry so much, I almost wanted to!! But, the sad part in this book is when she falls down from the tree, and can't walk.<br />  From,<br />  Joy & her Mom
B005OCFHHK|5.0|great price and unblemished medium in a compact collector box that makes it easy to find and store on a shelf.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I've followed PTX from their debut on The Sing Off. This album, like all of their others, includes amazing and ingenious vocal arrangements of classics perfectly performed by the 5 member group.
0307716988|5.0|I love this book 'cause it's clearly in Michael's own words.  I've heard him in enough interviews to know his \\"voice.\\"  It's too short but I'm grateful for anything.  It's also *very* polite (e.g., he says he doesn't understand his father when a less tactful person might point out that Joseph is a monster).  Still, there are enough revelations to make it worth digging thru.  For example MJ calls himself the loneliest person in the world.  Ow.  He calls Diana Ross his friend/mother/\\"lover.\\"  Wow.<br /><br />Michael Jackson is simply the only person I trust to talk about Michael Jackson.  Everyone else will simply lie because that's what sells.  So that leaves us with this book and his book of poetry and MJ's song lyrics.  I'm grateful for them all because Michael Jackson is the most interesting and admirable and talented man who ever lived.  Love you MJ.
1452101248|5.0|&#62;I bought this book on recommenation from a friend - an excellent cook, and felt that the recipes were attractive and different. Although  I am not vegetarian myself I have already tried and enjoyed a couple of the recipes - and plan to give it as Christmas presents lto my family.
B0040T7CFS|3.0|The box was so poorly packaged because of inadeqate cushioning material that some of the CD's may be unplayable.<br />The music I have heard is wonderful, however, and I only can hope that most of the discs are undamaged.<br /><br />This is my first complaint about an Amazon purchase; my previous experiences have been very good.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought this to stream my laptop video to my tv.  I have 50mb internet and the video even at 480p was glitchy so much that it almost made me sick watching it.  The actual apps, Netflix and Hulu, worked great.  Streaming not at all.  I ended up getting a Roku 3 and absolutely love it.  Well worth the extra price.  Streams beautiful 1080p and has 100s of apps.  As of now the chromecast only has 2 or 3.  Maybe when google gets things going this will be a great product, but as it is now spend the extra for a Roku.
0741470314|5.0|This book had to be written, and I'm so grateful to the author for taking on the mammoth task and delivering to well.  It's a brutally painful read because MJ had a brutally difficult life--and death.  But it had to be written.  All the vicious lies by greedy extortionists and sleazy media have to be debunked.  This book does that.  I hope every MJ fan buys this book, spurns the tabloid books, and works to give MJ the legacy he deserves, that of greatest entertainer and greatest humanitarian ever.
B001NLL93W|4.0|This book had me hanging on to every word I read. It was surprising and dramatic, I even cried which never happens when I read a book. Can't wait to finish reading the rest of the series! I've already recommended these books to several of my friends.
B00ANY94A0|5.0|Purchased this for my granddaughter, as she has a fascination with squirrels running thru the yard at the moment.<br />Know that she will love this addition to her Lego Friends toys.
B005DOKIYG|3.0|I have a skin on my Kindle, so it doesn't fit in the sleeve 100% unless I remove the skin. But, when I am taking the Kindle out of the house, i want the extra protection of the padding that this sleeve offers.<br /><br />Other reviewers complained about the smell. I didn't notice any.
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena is my new favorite book by Rick Riordan. I loved it. It ended (as always) on a real cliffhanger. I have to admit, I didn't expect that at all.<br /><br />I love how we knew who Annabeth was going to face on her journey alone because it allowed us to try and come up with ways she would succeed. And then she didn't do it at all how I thought she might. I was expecting a fight to the death or something to that effect, but (of course) I was wrong.<br /><br />Riordan brought forth a lot of new myths he hasn't used yet and introduced us to what I think, are people we didn't expect to meet. Plus, we got to see the Roman side of Mr. D. and learn a little bit more about how the whole Roman and Greek thing was affecting the Olympians.<br /><br />I have to say though, one of the most intriguing things for me was his explanation and revelations about Greece and Rome. It really is an interesting plot and I have no idea how Riordan can get any better than he already is. But, I know he will because that's how he is. Each book gets better and better (I say this with the exception of The Sea of Monsters; I didn't like that one as much).<br /><br />Now, just to sum it up. Excellent book. Read it and love it!
1623650003|5.0|It's been over a week since I read this (and I read it in one day, on a Sunday) and I cannot stop thinking about this book! I don't think the writing/translation was so groundbreaking or amazingly beyond incredible but the book had a flow that was just too easy and pleasant to ignore. The story, however, was so clever (IMHO) and brilliant, moved flawlessly and provided enough twists and random shockers that I felt like I taking a walk (and I did). I highly recommend this book to all fiction/crime fans. Amazing.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book helped me to change my thinking and thus change my reality. We all have the power, unlock it!
B00F9040HU|3.0|This is a good game if you like match three games. The price is a little high but I guess you would spend more if you bought in store.
0525478817|3.0|Talk about a tear jerker.<br /><br /> Hazel is living with cancer, waiting for the moment she will eventually die. There is no hope of ridding herself of it. She doesn't have any friends and spends most of her time reading or in front of the TV, until she meets Augustus one day at Support Group.<br /><br /> The narrative in The Fault in Our Stars was wonderfully organic. It always felt very honest and all around realistic to me. Hazel has lived with death looming over her for three years now so she's a bit of a pessimist and is really just living so her parents won't have to deal with her death just yet. Mostly a homebody, she goes through life trying to hurt the least amount of people as possible when she dies. Augustus was full of life and really helped Hazel live for probably the first time in three years, despite her trying to avoid it and him. He didn't quit and he never pitied her. He understands her. And how cute is it that he called her Hazel Grace? I loved that.<br /><br /> The actual story had me crying or trying not to cry for the approximately the last 60 pages or so. But... the ending felt a little incomplete. I fully expected Hazel to die or be on her death bed at the end of the book but it didn't end that way.... I guess that just seemed like the right ending for this book to me. The ending wasn't bad though, I mean...well just read the little teaser below.<br /><br />\\"You never worry if she is smarter than you. You know she is. She is funny without ever being mean. I love her. I am so lucky to love her, Van Houten.\\"<br /><br /> So sweet. Over all, I enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars and while I can't think of anything that really put me off, it was just a three-star book for me.
B008GWOVB8|1.0|Annoying garbage. Horrible songs. It makes you want to stick a coat hanger through your ear holes and out your eyes so you won't have to hear or see this movie ever again.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Loved it. This girl and her family are amazing. I hope they accomplish their goals an make education the right of all!
B0025KW29U|5.0|Since I'm a big Joss Whedon fan, I wanted to introduce my daughter to some of his works.  I rented this from the local library when my daughter was younger (pre-school/kindergarten) and she loved it! Although she didn't understand the entire movie (glad she didn't), she got most of it and loved the songs.  Flash forward to now (she's a pre-teen) and this is still one of her favorite dvds.  A got to have if your a Joss Whedon fan.  Good taste runs in families...
0062059963|4.0|Prince Maxon has narrowed The Selection down to just a few girls now and things are getting pretty tense around the palace. Not to mention, the rebels are still attacking every few weeks. An old friend has arrived at the palace though, making America's decision and participation in The Selection that much harder.<br /><br />The Elite revealed a bit more about the rebels which was nice but the rebels didn't dominate the story, which I liked. They were featured a bit more though and gave us a little break from the constant frustration that is America.<br /><br /> Things have become more tense between the girls participating in The Selection. But Miss Cass didn't let it get downright nasty between the girls with cat fights and all, which is a relief because it could have gone that way. There was this one incident but the other girl had it coming. I'm so glad America gave the other girl a taste of what she deserved.<br /><br /> I liked seeing the Queen interact with the girls more but I was disappointed she and the King didn't have more interaction with America. I understand why there wasn't but I still wish there had been at least one conversation between the King and America before things blew up. I do hope we see the Queen speak to America more though. As for the King, he is despicable. Argh, what a horrible man!<br /><br /> And, finally, we've come to my favorite part of the story, America and Maxon. Let me just say, America was so frustrating. She'd get upset with Maxon but when he would come to see her or clear things up one of two things happened. 1) Stupid America yelled and pushed him away until he was too angry to talk to her. Or 2) she would say something to the effect, \\"I can't talk to you right now.\\" Either way, Maxon would leave. I understand him in case one. He cares about her and doesn't want to say or do something he'll regret so he leaves the room. But case two? I was so frustrated with him when he wouldn't just stand his ground and force her to listen to the explanation that would make everything better! Him leaving because she \\"couldn't talk\\" was infuriating. I was literally sitting on my bed thinking, \\"Don't leave. America is so stupid.\\"<br /><br /> But, as infuriating as it was, I loved seeing them together. And, in the end, America does at least decide to pull it together (thank goodness). The fact that Maxon finally confronts her (gently) with the truth (that she has to trust him and earn his trust), was a moment I relish. Finally, he says it!<br /><br /> As for Aspen.... Why oh why did he have to show up? I mean, I knew he would; it was to be expected but I just.... He doesn't make sense. He's all like, \\"I love you, America.\\" I was sitting there reading and mentally chastising him. It's treason for her to be involved with any guy on any level at this point. They've seen what happens when a girl in The Selection falls in love with another guy. I mean, if Aspen loves her then he'll stop risking her life. He broke her heart on purpose. Yeah, I understand it was so she would have a chance at a better life but he's also a little prideful. She told him what he had was enough and he broke her heart any way. Then Aspen comes waltzing in expecting her to still love him. And American just takes him back! Maxon has done hardly anything to her yet she just forgives Aspen. I kept waiting for them to get caught together.<br /><br /> So all in all, The Elite fulfilled its purpose as the frustrating part of a literary relationship without getting too frustrating. Yes, in between all of my frustration there were some really sweet moments between America and Maxon. And, if I have to admit it, with Aspen too. I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that the King is a horrible man. He had better die in The One.to the explanation that would make everything better!

B00F91SCXC|3.0|As usual with present day movies...over the top with special effects.  Entertaining, but not one of my favorites.  Worth a look.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is just what I needed to keep my kindle fire HD operating smoothly. I love the app and would recommend it to everyone.
0470913029|5.0|I have been very interested in learning more about nutrition.  Dr Cordain explains the Paleo diet and the scientific research that supports it.  There are also case studies explaining how people greatly improved their health by choosing this way of eating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addictive game i have ever played but it is also the most fun.  Everybody i know plays it  love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank God Amazon Kindle HD has Candy Crush. I love this game. Never tedious, very addicting, and time consuming. Thank you AMAZON!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is awesome. Get this one, not the one that you have to pay money. I feel sorry for the suckers that paid $.99 for that game. I'm so glad they have a free version. You get all the same awesome stuff, but for $.99 less. This game is awesome. Please get it. It will be worth your time. You get to have all the characters on Star Wars. It looks just like the movie. You get to join the pork side: launch pigs at birds. They need to make other angry birds games like this. But until then get this game.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great book, another sci-fi collection to get hooked on! The characters are very relatable and the plot is addictive. Can't wait to read them all!
B002DR3WG2|5.0|Published in 1813, the book hasn't lost it's knack 200 years later.  I only finished reading it and I must admit I was quite awestruck by the certitude of the characters. I couldn't stop once I began and finished this in a few days. My favorite character would have to be Mr. Collins. I found him quite firm in his stupidity and it was always entertaining having him. I do think the book is a little unbelievable because the story line is skewed towards what may not happen in the real world but don't we read to find something incredible? This is it.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I really liked this book, its a great story and it really helps you to look at problems and opportunities in a different way...
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is really fun. Some of the things are hard to figure out, which makes it more fun. I laugh at how my siblings when they look confused.
1476733953|5.0|In the past couple of years, I have read very few books that I could not put down. This was one. The plot is a combination of Blade Runner, Hunger Games, Metropolis and even THX 1138. If you are a true sci-fi, dystopian fan, all of these titles will mean something to you. I can only hope for a movie, but seriously read the book. Howey is a better writer than many who have been around for decades!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Love the interchangeable pen and invisible ink ends. Makes 4 different sounds, lights up, works great. Lovely for the Doctor fan in everyone. Plastic gives it a cheap feel, so some caution is advised when handling.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The book opened my eyes to what lies under the hard shells of so many of  Pipers fellow inmates.  It also strengthens  my opinion of the amount of judges, prosecutors and on down the line, that are far more worthy of being behind those bars than the ones they put there.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|A very well done goofy movie. definitely worth watching with the kids or with some friends. The Croods delivers lots of laughs.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I've been waiting forever for this game to be available on my Kindle and it won't load!!  I've been trying for hours and it just won't happen!  Very disappointed.
B008133MDK|5.0|I have loved the whole series. Season One and Season Two.  I worried that Season Two wouldn't be as good as the first but I shouldn't have.  It took the series to a new level of wonderful.  My only complaint is that the seasons only contain three episodes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come on the app store and finally it is I'd recommend this games to anyone any age

B000TEUSJK|1.0|we had no opportunity to watch this DVD as the version sent to us is NZ cannot be played here. Unusually poor service in this case and very disappointing that it was a waste of money as well. No response received when this was pointed out to Amazon.

B0013J1WKY|4.0|I really loved the show!! Christina Aguilera is at his best, his stage presence is undeniable!!<br />This dvd is something everyone should have in their collection, apeas fans of the singer, but fans of pop music
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My kids keep watching it over and over. They just love it. They think it's really funny to watch...it's true the humour is awesome.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I'm sad that this is the latest one, so I have to wait for Child to write the next one before I can read it. There are certain elements of the Reacher character that give me the shivers...he's really brutal, and the way he drifts around sort of looking for trouble is unpleasant. Having said that I love the stories and can't wait to see what's next. Spoiler alert: I was totally disappointed with how the main two characters ended things this time. I was hoping for more joy for Reacher (finally!). Having said that, I flew through the book and thoroughly enjoyed it as always.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This is a very good game. The story line is on time which makes it a complete game also. New weapons &amp; able to call for help on missions. I rate this a top game for kindle.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use it to help my child sleep. It filters out background noise that would wake him up.  A good free app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Of if you have a child who can't lives without it - then this pocket edition is just what you need.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I loved seeing what happened to Jack Torrance..The Shining was I think in King's top three along with Carrie and Salem's Lot. And I enjoyed the gunslinger series a lot too. When I LOVE a book I always wonder &#34;what happened&#34; to the characters, and I loved seeing Jack Torrance and his friend Halloran again. Had some creepy elements but not outright horror as the Shining did. I'm not quite sure what to fault with this novel...why I could not give it 5 stars. But something just wasn't quite up to &#34;the master's&#34; top level. Still enjoyed it and still recommend for Shining fans.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This monumental dark knight trilogy is such an imperative BLU RAY DVD collection to own! Not only are the movies top notch, the BLU RAY technology simply surpasses anything and everything else making it a notch lower than watching it in a super movie house with IMAX Technology!!!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Very fun. Even though it is somewhat predictable and a bit cheesy, it was FILLED with laughs and<br />great music. The lead characters had a wonderful chemistry going. Recommend it highly for a fun<br />filled night of laughter and fabulous music.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Can't stop playing it.  Much better than regular Solitaire.  It relaxes me completely.  I was so glad when I realized that I could get it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Kline skillfully compares a WW2 era orphan with an &#34;orphan train&#34; (circa 1920's) orphan, blending historical factual details with interesting novelization. Engaging characters and well paced. I had a hard time putting it down, wanting to see what would happen next. More importantly, it really gave me insight into why certain children behave the way they do! Those who have bounced from one foster home or group home to another may react the way these characters do, and if you know or work with these kids, it really helps you understand why they behave that way. Five stars across the board from me.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The series has Interesting characters and portrayal of class and social issues. A bit of an English version of Little house on the prairie. Couldn't wait to watch the second season.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Every time I try to install this app I get the message that I may not have enough space available. I hardly have anything left that I can take off my device but I still cannot install it and I don't see any way to try to figure out why.

0756407915|4.0|Similar to the first book. Filled with great writing and mystery. Liked the book a lot. my only knock is there are certain sections I find odd/ not that interesting and other sections I cannot put the book down = lack of consistency.

B002FOQY04|5.0|I absolutely love Kid CuDi and his music just speaks to me! This album is definitely one of my all time favorites, can't get enough of it
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|At last , a DVD whose special Features are presented in exactly the right format , ie ; added and deleted scenes are seamlessly integrated into each episode , an idea whose time has come ! Deleted scenes , presented separately from the movie are , at least to this viewer , bland and wanting. Looking forward to season two .
1401311091|4.0|I'm only about half way through with this story, the book was as described, and it's serving its purpose. It's very entertaining, and I'm loving the elements from the show in the book. I can't wait to read the next one.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I felt the curiosity to discover the secret but didn't think the book had a lot of depth until the end. Possibly as I have left schools and children's activities behind me many years ago the book didn't have a lot of interest for me.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love absolutely love this game it is highly addictive. It's on my phone tablet and kindle. I recommend this game it is very fun.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is the true story of an unknown hero, Father Hugh O'Flaherty, who saved countless lives during his tenure as a priest in Rome during WWII. Gregory Peck is superb in his portrayal. This is a fantastic memorable movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can finally play on my kindle! Love this game!<br />It works great on here even better than playing on the Pc.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive. Great combination of easy and difficult levels. I try to get 3 stars in every level but there are a few that i will have to return to to get the 3 stars. Great to see the game on the kindle.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|Pretty bad but not true bottom of the barrel. As usual in any Cruise movie has uncomfortable traces of Scientology weirdness throughout (lost memory engrams, for example) but these can be ignored. The movie could have been 1/2 hour long. Has some nice aspects but redundant. Cruise is as good as the role allows him to be. Good muscles. Babes=B+.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just plug it and ready to go.<br />It does what it's supposed to do without any hassle. Send any movies bought through the play store or any videos and control them from your phone/tablet.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|It's the best place to meet new people or date I love it I hope you love it to now sometimes your profile picture will like cut off on you that's the only problem

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Starting this book is a bit like following a maze. It's complicated, perhaps because none of the characters are totally likeable or because the may remind us that we are not perfect either
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This book was a little difficult to get into, but once you get into the book you don't want to put it down. I will read other books by this author.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It gives all the weather info you could want from a tablet. Short of having a wireless and expensive weather set-up in your back yard, this gives details most weather apps don't. Try it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that candy crush on Kindle fire HD is the best because it never use to be on Kindle fire.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Just started game looks like it will be fun, not to sure how everything works doesn't tell you about collections and how they work.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I am giving this a bad review because my computer stopped connecting to the internet after installing the app.  If anyone knows why this happened please comment.  I would love to know your thoughts.<br /><br />I plugged this in and installed the chromecast app and started to watch a movie from the internet and it stopped working after 3 seconds as the connection dropped.  After trying everything I could think of, I decided it wasn't for me and removed the device.  My computer still wouldn't connect to the internet.<br /><br />Here's the strange thing.  I could connect to some sites like Facebook but only through searching through Google first and connecting to the link from the search results.  I tried restarting my computer, my modem, my router, uninstalling chromecast, reinstallinlg, uninstalling again, restarting, etc.  I even asked questions on online forums to get help and was told that this was a noted issue with no known resolution.  Even connecting the modem right to my laptop didn't work.<br /><br />I called my ISP and they told me I needed to restore my computer to a date before the chromecast app was installed.  When I went to try it, there was only one restore point on my computer.  The day I installed chromecast which was a week prior.  This is strange because my computer creates restore points every day.  Hmmmm.  Makes you think.<br /><br />I ended up having to restore my computer to factory settings which was a huge pain and waste of time.  I'm sure this works great for a lot of people but I wasn't the lucky one.  I sold it on Craigslist for $25.  Thanks for nothing Google.
B00439MV42|4.0|This series, although now 23(!) years old, is still as lively as funny as it was when I first saw it. BTTF II was so dark and negative, we skipped straight to III and my daughters thought the Wild West setting and Doc's romance was hilarious, not dated as I thought they might find it.  A good sleepover or family movie night choice, especially for those too young to have seen it the first time 'round.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It is not good it doesn't let me to watch videos. I do not like this app don't get it .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't.think that saying any thing I say will help because if you don't know this game then your not piveing..
B00ECP764C|5.0|Great film. Stunning cinematography with a compelling premise. Excellent acting from a great cast. And a beautiful soundtrack to complement the sleek visual effects. Entertaining and informative behind the scenes extras. This edition comes with nicer case artwork than the stock seen in most stores.
0451532244|5.0|Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.<br /><br />But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.<br /><br />During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.<br /><br />But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.<br /><br />But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.<br /><br />Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.<br /><br />The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow.the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work.

0446310786|4.0|Awesome! My son loved it. It was required reading for a school project. He said he did not even feel like it was.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I'm so glad I read A Thousand Splendid Suns.  It made me care so much for the Afghanistan people and their history.  I learned about so many things I wasn't aware of before like the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan.  I really connected with the women of this country and I empathized with them as they watched the destruction of their heritage and memories.  This book also made me realize how inaccurate my views of the people of Afghanistan really were.<br /><br />I read this for my book club and it made for excellent discussion and reflection on how women are treated.  It brought up issues like women not being treated like people, women's feelings being dismissed or completely ignored, women paying for the mistakes of others (especially men), and the idea that women exist to do things for men (make them food, give them kids etc.).  One of the most tragic examples of this was a husband abusing his wife because he didn't get anything from her.  She wasn't worth anything to him just as a person.  He had to gain something from her for him to treat her nicely. There's a quote from the beginning of the book from a cynical woman that sadly wasn't far off base from how a lot of the women were treated.<br /><br />\\"A man's accusing finger always finds a woman.\\"<br /><br />-Khaled Hosseini, A Thousand Splendid Suns, pg 7<br /><br />There were also positive issues brought up.  One women expresses how wearing her burqa makes her feel treasured and prized.  I really think a lot of the traditions of how women dress were meant as a show of respect and love but evil people like the Taliban have twisted their traditions into a way to demean women. They took a sacred tradition and twisted it to the opposite purpose. There were also men who really pushed for the education of women and how important it was for their country.  The love story in this book beautiful and sad.  He was very endearing with how much love and respect her showed the girl he loved.  Their love story had a shocking twist that I did not see coming and it had me in tears.<br /><br />Overall, it was a beautiful book that really opened my eyes to the wonderful people of Afghanistan and their history and how many women are still mistreated today.

0440211727|3.0|I saw this book had received 4/5 stars and was looking forward to reading it.  While it is certainly a page turner, it sometimes spends too much time describing mundane descriptions, while at the same time, it sometimes flies right past what should be very important events. In the court scenes, the testimony of one major character is described by another character in a few sentences, while testimony about relatively minor points goes on for pages.  Too often I found myself thinking. \\"Why are you telling me all this?\\" when a long scene offers nothing about character development or furthers the plot. By the end of the book, the future of several key characters are completely unknown and there are too many questions left unanswered.<br /><br />I have read other Grisham books and this one not one of my favorites.

B003VA3JUO|4.0|Ghost Ship(released Oct/02)stars,among others,Gabriel Byrne,Julianna Margulies,Ron Eldard,Desmond Harrington,Isaiah Washington and Keith Urban.This is a straight ahead,no frills ghost story that can be quite gripping at times ad keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />The story opens with a flash back to a luxury ocean liner in the early 60s.There is a grand ball being held on deck when someone flips a switch and a guy wire tears into everyone's bodies,killing them all.The only survivor is a young girl.<br />Fast forward to present day and a crack crew of salvagers get a tip from an airman who has spotted a large ship adrift in the Bering Strait.They investigate its last known location and find it;in fact they literally bump into it.They go aboard and start a sweep of the interior.Part way along one crewman goes through the floor and is pulled back up by another,who briefly sees a little girl standing on the floor below.Shrugging it off they all continue to investigate.Along the way they discover a hug cache of gold and decide to forget salvaging the ship.When they try to leave,their salvage ship blows up,killing a crewman.From here on,things get desperate for the crew.They decide to float the ship to the nearest port but spirits within the ship start showing themselves.The young girl seen briefly earlier now makes herself known to one of the crew.The captain of the salvage team enters the cabin of the ships captain,and he appears to him.He shows him a bit of the back story to what lead to the crews deaths.It seems they picked up one survivor from a sinking liner,along with the gold.The survivor looks alot like the airman who put them onto this ships location and is aboard with them now.<br />The little girl further enlightens them as to what happened,as the man they picked up encouraged the original crew to mutiny so they could claim the gold for themselves.It is this entity that has kept the crew and passengers souls there since the incident that killed them and he is after this salvage crew now.One by one the salvage crew falls by the way side until there is only one survivor,who has to confront the evil entity.We learned that this thing works for Satan and uses the ship to collect souls for his masters.The last survivor,after a struggle,manages to sink the ship and free the souls from bondage.Adrift in the ocean the survivor is eventually rescued.Sitting in an ambulance near the dock side,she spots some of her old friends loading boxes(presumably the gold boxes)onto the ship,followed by the self same entity she thought went down with the ship.<br />I thought the ending was a bit of a question mark,not making alot of sense,but other than that the story,on the whole,was pretty credible.All do a fine job in the acting department and it was well directed and edited.After having lots of exposure from Xena:Warrior Princess as Caesar,Keith Urban did this movie just after Xena ended,and just before he co-starred in the epic trilogy Lord of the Rings.Urban is now a rising star in such films as Judge Dredd and Star Trek.It is good to see Keith is doing so well.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound here,and they include:three featurettes,a ships tour,a music vid,a the trailer and enhanced features for your PC.<br />In conclusion Ghost Ship is a perfect movie to get the popcorn out for,if you're looking for a good scare.It is not perfect but it generally satisfies over all.3 1/2-4 stars.e is after this salvage crew

0451419243|3.0|This reads like a trashy romance novel.  I think we all know what boys and girls get up to in life and don't need to be bludgeoned at every turn with every pulse pounding, breathless encounter.  Also, the characters (the author) would have us believe the Japanese were justified in attacking Pearl Harbor because of a US embargo.  Maybe they hadn't heard of their invasion of China, The USSR and Mongolia.  Some of the history is worthwhile, though, such as the testing of a nuclear pile in downtown Chicago.  The first book of the trilogy (Fall of Giants) was better and I hope the last one (Edge of Eternity) will be epic.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's super fun and addictive . Candy crush gives me easy entertainment, and I'm so glad that I can now play it on my Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|there is no better app than this it so worth a whole seven dollars i dont care for apps that try and rip off minecraft ther is only one minecraft
B00FPH6M82|1.0|Will Smith great actor who wasted his talent in this movie for sure. Jaden may make it some day but in my opinion does not belong in feature films as of yet, if he wants to follow his fathers footsteps then he should do that, start out in another Fresh Prince series or anything that will allow him to learn a little each day.<br /><br />All in all it was a complete waste of $5.99, would have been better off giving it to the guy on the street corner for a beer or two.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|Can not read the numbers on the loom because they are the same color as the loom coupled with the fact they are very tiny, and the directions suck! Lots of typos!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|the app is alot less confusing than the site and alo mor convenient. hasle bothers me and this app has no hassle. so happy
B008I34ZUM|4.0|I purchased Freak Out when i was in the 10th grade.if you are just getting into Zappa and looking for live.start with live at the Fillmore.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|Wow, this was an awful movie. It seemed to be of very low budget and the acting was horrible. It should not even be associated with Oz at all. Im glad i did not buy it, i rented it from the local library and we will never want to watch this film ever again.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Reading through Helen Fielding's new Bridget Jones novel is like catching up with the best of friends. Even though it has been ages, you can take up exactly where you left off; perfectly comfortable -wildly guffawing at Bridget's hilarious, endearing and painfully honest domestic episodes, a number of which scarily mirror some of your own life experiences over the last decade since last reading about Bridget's last adventures. While Mark Darcy may be sadly gone, Scott Wallaker is definitely cast from the same mould, so a reassuringly 'Darcy' like ending for grieving fans. The only thing concerning aspect of this novel was realising how close the ending was and wondering how long it will be before the next funny, witty and heart-warming chapter of Bridget Jones's life is published? Hopefully not so long.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|It was a page turner for me, though I did find some of the plot twists to be a bit farfetched. Still, I'm glad I read it and liked the insight into post-WWII USSR. I wouldn't go around recommending it, but it's fun for some leisure reading.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Great series 3 episodes about 90 minutes per episode. I can hardly wait for the next season to come out.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|My wife and friends loved the movie because of the roaring twenties look. Get this movie soon it will be fun to watch.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This dvd is worth its weight in gold for how entertained it keeps my three-year-old son.  He just loves \\" The Gruffalo,\\" and as a mom who gets tired of the silly obnoxiousness that are part of so many kids television shows, I love it too.  This is just a fun, feel good story.  The characters are endearing.  My son loves the mouse, but even the Gruffalo himself has his charms.  The animation is sophisticated and fun and the music is beautiful.  Highly recommend!
B00C2IN76C|5.0|Great movie, the comic book is better, but still a great movie and this steel book is just awesome with the same cover as the comic book.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|Love this movie.  Very intense.  A movie that you will want to see to the end.  You will never get board with this movie.
B004QMYKSG|3.0|I became familiar with The Naked and Famous, hearing a few of their more popular songs played on internet radio, and so I purchased the album. The three songs that I was familiar with and really enjoyed were the only songs that I enjoyed on the album. I was surprised to hear a significant change in genre throughout the album, as it changed to a heavy-metal sort of sound, with loud, harsh instrumentation, far from the catchy, upbeat and cheery sound that I expected.
B00BSZZA3I|2.0|Though the case LOOKS great and has custom fit for the HTC ONE MV, the material is rather flimsy and loose...
B001F12J48|5.0|The product was wonderful! I sent to my son for PreChristmas for his family. Made a wonderful gift.Looked great on his new 3D TV.Thank you!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and addictive. Its is a nice game. It can be a challenge. My only dislike is waiting for lives.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|don't even bother with the movie because it is a let down compared to this book. the book is freaking awesome! I could barely put it down! so detailed. it's great!
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|I love the app. It has a lot of instructions for my LEGO sets and if I have the right pieces I can build sets I never bought. I recommend this app to everyone!!!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Great graphics. This is the best game that i have found so far to match the graphics of the games for a PC.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I read a book about Gunter Prien a German Submarine commander, and I heard of this film. I think the film best represent the submarine battle.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I love this game but have to give it a low rating because at first it let me connect to facebook but, then it kept saying it couldn't connect and then today I go to play and have been kicked back to level one.  I wish this problem would be solved I have doe over 100 levels and am not going to start over.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm sure anyone would love it! It was awesome and tricky but awesome and I Love it Funnnn brain buster!
0385349947|5.0|I read this for a book club of business women and the stories were definitely recognizable to us.  Good book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This did the trick.  The Kindle Fire now charges just like it did when it was new.  Makes me wonder if that was what was wrong with the first one I bought as this is the one that Amazon kindly and quickly replaced that one with
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I was surprised to see the little plush Belt inside. The girls just love it. It was a great buy and we just love the film.
1878424750|5.0|I am a fan of Deepak Chopra, great deal!!!  I have the book, I wanted to be inspired daily, so thought i could listen to it<br />on my way to work, to start the day, in a good way.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works fine and charge fast, just as advertised.  It's a nice complement for Anker® SlimTalk 3200mAh when you are traveling.
B007ME5BUG|2.0|The Second World War by  Antony Beevor.<br /><br />It was a  thorough and easy to follow for someone that is not well read.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|I was very pleased with this product.<br />It was delivered in a timely manner and completely brand new.<br />Never been opened previously and played seamlessly all the way through.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is hard to put down so it's good when I run out of tries and have to wait to play again. Pretty smart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game so glad I finally got it on my kindle fire hd it's about time they add it on here so I could play :)
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It doesn't delete emails from the MSN email server. You don't have access to all your folders and you can't add new folders.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bakersfield by Vince Gill/Paul Franklin<br /><br />What a wonderful CD. I had heard some of it on Willies Road House, on XM Radio.  I would purchase it again.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great for buying and selling on Ebay. Keep up to date with your watch list. Make purchases right from your phone or Kindle.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I never was a &quot;gamer&quot;. Played Pac man back in the day. I can't stop playing. This is easy to learn. And when you do, find a comfy seat. You're gonna be there awhile. A lot.of fun.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|A great time killer. Very addictive game. You can play for hours and not get bored. Download it you'll love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was gud I passed all 10 levels but It took me a while but I made it finally but it was easy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't have a facebook account but I can still play this game.  I think it is about time they got this game for kindle.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Best of the series so far.  Much more human drama with less space combat.  Got me into the character's plight more fully
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Every child in every nation should hear this story, even if they are not old enough to read it. We all should know that even in this day of high tech gadgets, one of the poorest of the poor can dream, can create, and can make those dreams come true, if they, like William, say, &#34;I try, and I did it.&#34;
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|Amazing lead vocals, great musical arrangements. Definitely the Best album of 2013! Already looking forward to their follow up album.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just Excelent waiting for google to include more apps like MLB or make it open to xbmc or something like that.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Fun and great for the mind. It is awesome for kids in schools. good for the brain to think. Fffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnn.
B00DDQTKHM|4.0|It's a little dated, but the main ideas are still the same. As long as you can understand the idea that Facebook replaced MySpace... And that at some point something will replace Facebook... The individual principals do not change.
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|Found that the novel tied up many loose ends from Oryx and Crake. Provided a glimpse of  hope for a questionable kind of future.
055358202X|5.0|With  the well known reputation on Martin's choice of dividing the books in half being mainly mixed, this may sound like a turnoff, as it seems to many reviewers,to be a waste of time and sometimes confusing and pointless. I am here to tell you it is simply not the case.<br /><br />  Just forget what people/fans tell you about why the publishing arrangements of dividing half the characters in two books, and just read it. If you are a true fan of the series it shouldn't matter, as long as martin gives us something to expand the story's universe. I also feel that this book shouldn't be compared as an individual novel rather essential in being reviewed as part of the saga. This is to the recent reviews I have read reviewing the book as is, stating it's confusing plot and pacing. This would be true if it was a standalone novel, but luckily it is not. Hello people, look at the bigger picture. Any true fan has an idea of where the story is headed. Like Martin Says himself this book and the next serve mainly as the groundwork to the epicness to come. If you have read the previous books and with the knowledge that Feast of Crows only tells the story of half the characters you should be fine with any organization/editing problems.<br /><br />  Now just because I said groundwork don't think this book is utterly boring. On the contrary it sets up a whole bunch of climatic moments that will have you on the edge of your seat till the very end. Think of it as a chess game. This book sets up all the pieces as well as Dances with dragons until the winds of winter come out.<br /><br />  As of nit picking the negatives, I really feel no need to name them for they are most likely to be different from person to person, such as if you hate one specific character(cesie) and don't want to read of what they do next because you are afraid of another Rains of Casamere, then you might not like this book. For me I love all the characters in their own way and gladly read and savored every detail of them.<br />But other than that read this book if you are a true fan. Don't skip it, enjoy it like I did and don't let those haters tell you other wise.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is challenging. To get all the fruits down with more keep coming is what is crazy and to get it done in the time frame and before the moves are done is the challenge.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|We hear about people having been to Heaven and having been to hell, I do believe Jesus is trying to tell us he is coming and keep the oil in the lamp in case he is delayed.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I loved the tv show so I now have started the books. I have found the first one a gem I think anyone or everyone would enjoy them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Amazon FINALLY got candy crush saga... App works great and has no hiccups so far... I love this game!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|they finally got this app on the kindle fire! I love this game so much and now I get to have it on the kindle! it is very addictive!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Pretty good at what it does. Keeps things running smooth. And I don't have to pay much attention to anything .
0385523394|2.0|If you love the show, skip the book! The book is nothing like the series. Kerman simply uses it as a forum to declare how her \\"minor\\" crime should not be punished and to rail against the current state of the US prison system and its treatment of CRIMINALS, who in Kerman's mind have no business being locked up. Skip this one, and enjoy the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I never read trite books about cancer bc they don't feel genuine or real. I feel they try to force emotions. This book was the complete opposite. Laugh out loud funny and I am also came thisclose to crying on public transportation. HIGHLY recommend.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am using the item since arrived it. I have on it a lot of items to used them when I am taking pictures with my cameras.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Love her tragically flawed characters. Most female characters are super boring or trying to be perfect; hers are just trying to get through their day. Funny and dark
B007MU85D0|5.0|Love this album. Great when a new group comes along with a newand fresh sound. Tire of the cookie cutter groups that come out every day.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I honestly don't get all the fuse about this book. I thought it was going to be so much better
B008TT7CXW|5.0|These are the greatest invention for easily keeping all those memory cards organized. My only criticism, and believe me this is wayyyyy small, is that it would be nice if the card itself was very light gray plastic instead of the dark. It's about the same color as many memory cards and they blend in. It would be nice to have contrasting color to have visual clue as to which slots are already occupied.
B009R659L8|3.0|Honestly, just like all of her other novels. Fun and quick read, but nothing super special. But in all fairness, for once, I didn't see the ending coming.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I really love this solitary game, however you won't win that much. I'm pretty good at this game on my computer, but my winning percentage on this game is around 37 percent. This means you lose about 2 out of 3 games. That's why I gave it 3 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!!! So Addicting!!!! My day flies by because I get stuck on this. Great for all ages. I Recommend this app!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is so awesome. I think you should not have to pay 200 hundred coins to breed dragons.<br /><br />Simeon Wassom
B0000669JL|5.0|Bob Marley is the greatest. This kind of reggae is great. I recommend this cd to everyone who likes Bob Marley
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  Lots of fun.  Never boring.  I highly recommend this game if you like mahjong.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|A treat for the imagination.  Excellent descriptives and good timing.<br />I read it in two days!  Couldn't wait to know the whole story but still savored the unraveling of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad I can now play this on my kindle it is a fun game. I hope they.let.me play pet rrscue
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I've been aware that I've used these principles since I was a child, but somewhere I let go of them from my consciousness and have for too many years been letting the tail wag the dog.  This book has put me back on track, and I am grateful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|this book was wonderful! Although I love Stephen King, I was somewhat skeptical that A sequel/follow on book to the shining could possibly be in the same league. I was pleasantly surprised though, and as usual Stephen King didn't disappoint!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game if you're bored. Not too hard to play i wouldnt buy thid game unledd you paid me to buy it. Ewsy to play after a bit of practice.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Love the piano but the songs are mediocre.  Just the title song, Going Home, is the singular hit.  Easy listening music.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I found this version easy to download and use. I would gladly recommend it for others. Enjoy the game for a few moments or an evening.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|I've had this watch for a few months now.<br /><br />Initially, I thought it might be too heavy for daily wear, but it's just fine.<br />I work with the public and I get numerous compliments or inquiries every time I wear it.<br />I'm very satisfied with this watch. It keeps great time; never loses a second.<br />I wanted a big, black and gold chronograph with a strap. So that's what I purchased.<br />This really is the perfect watch for me.<br />Your mileage may vary, right? Helps to have a big wrist, I guess.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book it really gave me the belief that I am a powerful creator and that I have been creating my whole life
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I have 803.79 MB of space available on my Kindle Fire yet apparently, there's not enough room for a 35.9 MB game.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is entertaining and the graphics are pretty good. NEEDS quicker weapon upgrades and ability to get new weapons also.
B00FKQ38OE|4.0|The 'New' McCartney cd is very, very good. The background stereophonic SOUND EFFECTS (probably in some degree, G. Martin influenced) are very reminiscent of some of the later B E A T L E S albums. I kinda think that some of this 'rubbed off' on other rock groups like 'Pink Floyd' and 'Emerson, Lake and Palmer.' There are also some acoustic (and electric) guitar riffs that are exemplary of the antiquity of the 1960s pop music scene. \\"Old Guys' Music\\"..............just sayin'
B00ESB6GBY|2.0|This season is not particularly well written and seems mean spirited, especially the conflict between Robin and Barney's mom. Marshall's road trip narrative is disengaged from the rest of the story. And where's The Mother? When she was integrated into the first two episodes the results were charming and heartfelt. Subsequently, with her absence, the season seems drawn-out, stretched thin.
B00BCX2F66|3.0|I like this case. It'll probably be the case for the life of my phone, but the same attention to detail that went into designing the HTC One, did not go into designing this case. For example, when the flap is closed, you can't see the notification light, even though there are cut outs for the speakers - if the speaker cut out was a quarter inch lower, you'd be able to see it. But in general, it's nice. It's not the toughest case, but I think it'll do a good job extending the life of my phone and I regularly use the built in stand.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Shin`s story taught me more about Korea, North and South, than I would have ever known.  When visiting S. Korea, I found a magazine article about the book. I knew I had to buy it. Now I want to purchase a hard copy so I can share with others who do not have a Kindle.  I pray the people in these prisons find peace.
B000059MEL|1.0|Disc 1 at the side B on the external lead-in contains extraneous inclusion (looks like a 1mm size particle) that affects in sound quality with a significant &#34;chpock!&#34; sound<br /><br />So, there is no &#34;Daft Club&#34; member card though
B005LAIIS0|4.0|The Grey Blu-ray edition is a fantastic transfer and demonstration of video and audio quality for any high definition fan.<br />pros - excellent visual quality and filmic filters<br />- excellent audio<br />- excellent film<br />cons - unexciting case<br />- incredibly bare extras
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you King corp and Amazon!!!  Not long ago I was questioning WHY can I not get Candy Crush Saga for my Kindle Fire...  Love this game, but! be fore warned it is very addicting!  Try it... you will like it.
B00FN811SY|5.0|What a wonderful tool to have for personal study! I am truly thankful for this. Everyone in the family can use this!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At first its like: ok what is this about? And next thing I'm<br /> doing is clicking all over the screen, because there has to be a way out!
B002IR3PSC|4.0|This is the way I remember IA and company.  Energized and eccentric, joyfully playing some of rock's finest music.  Problem?  Just that it leaves me wanting more, much more.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|So easy to watch using the Wii Amazon app, love how technology has progressed so that you can download a TV episode and watch it immediately . . . Loved it!
0515153656|5.0|THe twists and turns within this plot kept me guessing.  The characters really came to life.  I look forward to reading more of Lee Child's work.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|As a 26 year old guy I can happily say that I watched this movie in theaters, pre purchased it it on blu-ray, then bought it again once I got a 3D TV. IMO every one of these purchases was worth it. The movie itself is funny and very enjoyable to watch. The 3D on this movie is up there with how to train your dragon, and is definitely worth taking note of. This is a great movie for any time of the year, especially the holidays. Rent it, or buy it. One way or another, you probably won't regret seeing this movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Having death be the narrator did not sit well with me at the beginning. But as story went a long I couldn't see it done any others way! What a great writer Markus Zusak is!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|There is nothing I don't love about this series. I would recommend this to anyone that loves the supernatural. If you like the first 4 seasons of supernatural you will love this one.
1582406723|5.0|What can I say that everyone hasn't already said. Awesome series. Great story telling, compelling characters, fantastic artwork. There is a reason this series has been so popular for so long. Because it is great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad you finally released game for Kindle Fire.  It is fun and addictive.  I always had to play on desktop computer,now I can sit in my easy chair.  I just happened on it the day before I saw the announcement.  Great news.
B00008CLIP|4.0|I have played in bands and love the music. This is as good as it gets. Get  the CD and rip it as lossless as you can.
1595826971|5.0|incroyable ! great art work ,extremely well rounded from sketches to end product ,there's a lot of great talented artists in this book and their interpretation.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast player works great! We love streaming movies from Netflix now. No more connecting cables every time. I recently had the cable guy come out to repair an outdoor connection. He saw the Chromecast player and said he was thinking about getting one. I showed him how it works. He thought it was great!
B00DNLXDUW|5.0|This GMAIL client works on my 8.9 inch Kindle Fire HD!  I installed the app with standard settings and everything works great!  You can easily see and move messages around, compose, etc.  It does not yet support the multiple inboxes (primary, social, promotions, etc.) format of the new GMAIL but that doesn't bother me at all, can work around it.  This client allows email to &#34;push&#34; notify and it's very quick, close to the speed my phone receives alerts for new emails.  This is what I missed w/the stock client since it no longer could get push notifications and it was checking around every 5 minutes or so.  This was worth the money!  I hope they keep updating it.  I'd pay annually a couple of bucks to keep it updated.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The alarm on this app works as described.  I haven't overslept since getting this clock.  The alarm iseasy to turn off, but not so easy that you can do it in your sleep.
B00A2H9WW8|3.0|I am an obsessive CARRIE fan...the book, the original movie, the musicals, the TV movie version - I've seen them all, several times.  To me, the story is timeless and resonant, and for adolescents in particular, the story of CARRIE packs a powerful punch. Several things surprised me about Kimberly Pierce's \\"reimagining\\" of CARRIE as a contemporary horror film - firstly, it is in many ways a shot by shot remake of the superior DePalma film; secondly, where it DOES deviate from DePalma's film, it fails (in some cases embarrassingly so) by comparison; and thirdly, the lead of this CARRIE is ALL WRONG.  Chloe is far too self-aware and bold as a young woman to ever convey the tragically sad Carrie White.  For me, the impressive pyrotechnics and CGI that fill the last hour might have actually been worth the re-tread had we been as engaged with the character as we were with the spookily perfect Sissy Spacek.  But alas, despite a good, updated supporting cast - chief among them Judy Greer as a winning, funny gym teacher, and Portia Doubleday as a Chris Jargensen you viscerally hate - this CARRIE is more full of sound and fury, but signifying far less than DePalma's still-heart pounding original.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|The story is interesting but it does a lot of bouncing back and forth. What bothers me the most is the lack of consistency in the novel. Spoiler alert: for example, Hunter never comes back from helping Tack with taking food to the 3rd encampment but he is listed as one of the people who helps carries Blue when she is sick. Then later again it is mentioned that they don't know where he is. There are several instances like this in the book. How did the editors not catch this?
B005LAIGPU|4.0|Queasily effective, this taut \\"found footage\\" thriller owes much to the original CARRIE.  It creates a mood of dread by painting a quick but succinct picture of 3 very different boys - each with their own cross to bear - and then deftly provides them with an evolving array of superpowers.  You become engaged as things begin to spin out of control, and the movie provides more than a few visual and narrative surprises along the way.  You will wonder, what would you do if you had the power?
0205313426|5.0|The book was recommended by one of my professors. The item arrived on time. The book should be helpful as I am writing my Thesis.
0316228532|2.0|This was not an exciting book to read, in fact it depressed me a bit.  I loved the HP books and spent many a sleepless night till I finished each one.  This one I put down and had a hard time finishing.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is the second time reading this book. I loved it as much this time as the first. One of my favorite books.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|For the past few months, I have depended on this app and loved, but now....What happened to the ability to add tasks????
B008133JZG|1.0|This is a review of \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\".<br /><br />For the most part, I really enjoyed the first season of Sherlock and fully expected to have the same response to season 2. After the first 10 minutes of \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" I realized the experience had changed. I was hoping this series would rise above the base cultural moral standards that are lowering each day, but sadly this episode follows the downward trend. Sad that this is acceptable on mainstream tv...<br /><br />I know there are many who disagree with what I am saying, this isn't written or meant for you. This review is to help someone to know what is in this episode so they can be informed before they are exposed to it. This is meant to be helpful to the small few of us who don't want to watch what we call filth.<br /><br />SO, If you aren't offended by gratuitous portrayals/insinuations of S&M  behavior and strategically placed camera angles that show everything but full frontals, you'll probably like this episode. IF however you are offended by such, pass on this episode.<br /><br />A disappointing entry to an intriguing take on a mystery classic
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Read, where Director's and Producers love to work with Jolie, because<br />she loves to do alot of her stunts. She is willing to take the chances.<br />Not only is she pretty, she can do all the action shots.<br />Lovedit.<br />Even bought extra copies to share with frineds.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|I love this movie. Great fun for kids and adults to enjoy at Halloween or anytime. It was a great price and shipped quickly.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The Shining is one of my favorite Stephen King books, and I was excited to be able to revisit Danny (now just Dan) in his later years.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep starts shortly after Danny and his mom, Wendy, leave the Overlook, but it fast-forwards soon after to Dan in adulthood. And he's a mess. Like his father, Dan is an alcoholic. He is smart and a hard worker, but he can't seem to stay in a job because his drinking keeps getting in the way. Until he lands in Frazier, NH. There, Dan finds the means to quit drinking and start making something of himself.<br /><br />Dan comes into mental contact with Abra when she's just an infant. Though he doesn't know where she's from, he can tell almost immediately that she has a very strong &#34;shine.&#34; Even stronger than his. She keeps coming to &#34;visit&#34; him over the years, and they form a bond through their shared gifts. When they finally meet face-to-face twelve years later, she desperately needs his help. It seems there are some people called the True Knot who take a liking to kids with the &#34;shine&#34; in a very bad way. And, of course, Dan has to help. Just like Dick Halloran helped him all those years ago.<br /><br />This story initially started slowly for me. The backstory was important, but it wasn't attention-grabbing. I know Uncle Stevie likes to slowly create a yarn, but it would have been better had the story been a bit tighter. After Dan and Abra meet, the pacing picked up quite a bit. While I enjoyed the paranormal elements in this story, Doctor Sleep was nowhere near as terrifying as The Shining. But I don't think it was meant to be.<br /><br />You do have to wait a bit to understand the origin of this book's title. But wow, it really moved me. And it especially reminds me of why I fell in love with Stephen King's writing to begin with.<br /><br />Overall, this was a welcome follow-up and a worthy effort!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Started to play it just to see what kind of game out was.  It's kinda cute.  I'm sure younger kids will love it!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book was very slow in reading for the first half but the second half is amazing. I couldn't put it down!!!!! This series is a must read.
B0000024YL|2.0|Although this duo's music is on the cd, the sound quality is poor and words unclear on much of it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the complete series, each book was better than the last.  E.L James definitely made the ordinary extraordinary with this series!
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|I love this CD a lot.  It's hard rocking from the 1st song to the last.  The drum beats are similar to their other albums, but that is what I like about it.  Just more great rock & roll.  I have been anticipating their next album and &#34;Black Dog Barking&#34; did not disappoint me.<br /><br />Mike
B0019I6WDG|4.0|Juno is a comedy movie that came out in 2007 about a girl that becomes pregnant and all the trails and tribulations that go with it. It was directed by Jason Reitman, produced by John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon, Mason Novick, and Russell Smith, and stars Ellen Page as the title character.<br />Back when this movie came out in 2007, I watched it, I didn't understanding half the things Juno was talking about, but over the years while growing up and learning new slang, every time I watch this movie, I laugh at even more stuff. The writing is very clever, and the chemistry between the actors is pretty spot on.<br />This movie can be a perfect example of a teenage pregnancy, and all of the pressure it can bring to the girl and the people around her, which I believe is very important to understand in today's youth. Built around a comedic structure just brings a bit more of real life into this film.<br />Going back to dialogue, even though I understood more of the slang every time I watch this film, it still can become a bit overbearing. Every other sentence is filled with tongue in cheek comments that aren't necessary, which could lead to a turned off audience. Not to mention, the movie can be pretty slow at some points, going from a emotion heavy scene back to some quirky gimmick about tic tacs.<br />Overall, Juno is a great movie, both emotional and halarious, you just have to be in the mood for it. You can find Juno in your average video store or Walmart
B001N4RORE|3.0|This movie has the redeeming feature of having a number of &#34;name&#34; actors who are very good at what they do.. However, the storyline itself was shallow. When I saw it at a movie theater shortly after it was released I found myself closing my eyes so that I could listen to the Abba songs without being distracted by the actors. The cast did a pretty good job of singing these songs, and when I had my eyes closed I almost thought I was listening to Abba. For those who are Abba fans, all their great hits are in this musical, and it's worth watching for that reason. For someone who wants to watch a movie with some depth (and who doesn't care about Abba) &#34;Mamma Mia!&#34; is not one to take a chance on.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Excellent Riffs, each track is awesome in its own way.  This album deserves to be listened to Loud!  Classy yet refined sound.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|What happens when you spend five days a week fighting traffic so you can work in a dead-end job in a cubicle in an office where you have an uncaring boss who has hired two number-crunching consultants whose purpose is to show your boss how he can eliminate the waste (i.e., superfluous employees like you) and thereby make his company more profitable? The answer is \\"Office Space,\\" a truly funny movie with lots of laughs that rather accurately portrays the way things are at the typical office. If you've ever worked in an office, you're sure to find \\"Office Space\\" hilarious. But even if you haven't, you will enjoy it, for the stupidity of \\"managerial types\\" goes far beyond the typical office but is something that infects just about any organizational structure devised by human beings.<br /><br />Of course, most office drones put up with the nonsense and insecurity of their jobs. But every once in a while someone takes action. This is exactly what Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and several of his coworkers decide to do, as they figure out a way to hack into the computer software and embezzle millions of dollars. But ultimately the fellow who comes out on top is not Gibbons or his crew, but the most improbable of all characters, Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the off-kilter, totally eccentric guy with the coke-bottle glasses who constantly mumbles to himself. The last scene of the movie, in which he stars, is one of the funniest I have ever seen.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a young female lawyer this book struck many a chord.  I went in tentatively after hearing much press for and against this book.  I found it wonderful and inspirational, rarely pedantic or belittling.  Sheryl explicitly and repeatedly states that her opinions are not for everyone, that she's not telling stay-at-home-moms that they're doing something wrong.  She rightly and convincingly presents an argument for women to lean in to careers with full strength until a need actually comes up to pull back (if it does).  The book made me look back and wince at my young twentysomething self who spent interviews asking what us women were told to ask in interviews - what's the work life balance like here? how do you manage kids and law firm life?  I'm sure no one ever told the men in our classes to ask those questions (and I'm sure virtualy none of them did).  I watched time and time again as my colleagues turned down opportunities now because they thought it might impeded their ability to raise a family at some point a decade down the road.  Sherly helps illuminate the lost decade (and beyond!) that you trade when you make decisions like that.  I think it should be mandatory reading for people of both genders in law and business school (and beyond).
B002VXGW2E|5.0|I have to admit that when I first heard about 'Julie & Julia\\" I was a bit skeptical. How could a movie about one person making all the recipes in a famous chef's cookbook and blogging about it make for an interesting movie, one that was going to hold my attention throughout? I soon found out.<br /><br />First, both Meryl Streep (who, through a few photographic tricks manages to look far taller than she is in real life) and Amy Adams play the parts of Julia Child and Julie Powell to perfection. The talented Streep somehow manages to capture both the voice and the mannerisms of the famous chef to perfection. At the same time Adams convincingly plays the part of a somewhat unsure of herself but determined young woman who has set herself the goal of making all the recipes in the cookbook (some of which take a considerable amount of time), blogging about them, while at the same time holding onto her job in a federal agency in New York. (The tension that this creates in Julie's life and between her and her husband is well captured.)<br /><br />Second, the food is mouthwatering. It made me want to find a French restaurant where I could try some of the dishes portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Finally, the director, Nora Ephron, was able to cut from Julia to Julie and back at all the appropriate times, making sure that we captured what was going on with one or the other of them, but at the same time not focusing on either of them for so long as for the scene to become tedious.<br /><br />All in all, this is a movie definitely worth watching, even if you're not into French food.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful story.  Great read and must read for kids ages 8-11.  Had a great time reading the story with my child.  Highly recommended
B002SSUQFG|5.0|If you're considering buying this watch and have reservations due to some negative reviews let me try to assuage your fears. I've been reading the less than positive reviews with some amusement and the majority seem to be from people who have little or no idea of what an \\"automatic\\" watch exactly is or how to properly operate one. For example, one gentleman returned two of these watches as they both arrived with dead batteries. Another customer with a PhD after his name seemed rather disappointed that the watch did not have a light for better night time viewing. See what I'm getting at?<br />Others seemed to have purchased the watch as they liked the idea of battery free operation yet seemed rather dismayed when they received their purchase only to find that they had to actually do something to make the watch function.  Like occasionally wave it back and forth for half a minute or so if you've not worn it for a while.<br />Then there are the complaints from people who obviously didn't bother to read the specs and repine about the size of the case, lack of hacking feature or screw down crown, no sapphire crystal etc. and then knock off a couple of stars from their review. If you read the specs there will be no surprises. Just do a little research to make sure the specs meet your needs. In other words, don't order a hamburger and complain that it doesn't taste like a Kobe steak.<br />The only negative reviews that seem inexplicable are the ones that just complain of receiving a very substandard quality watch. The only explanation I can think of is they may have unwittingly purchased a counterfeit. Buying from Amazon's site doesn't mean it's coming from Amazon. I purchased mine from \\"Amazon\\" as opposed to \\"Sold by ______ and fulfilled by Amazon\\". I noted that choosing to purchase from Amazon was the only option that seemed to make mention of a warranty.  Just because these are inexpensive watches doesn't mean there aren't dystopian factories in China full of wan 9 yearolds pumping out a few hundred metric tons of counterfeit Seikos a day. Because there are.<br />On a brighter note, the watch I received showed excellent fit and finish and has been keeping excellent time. I can't really think of anything bad to say about it. Had I paid several hundred dollars I would be more critical but I paid a little over fifty dollars for an automatic that functions as it should and has a day/date display to boot. How can you go wrong?  To be honest, if I had paid double or triple this price I'd still be more than happy with it.<br />If you want the ultimate in time keeping accuracy pull out your iphone. If you're interested in buying a Spartan yet aesthetically pleasing automatic and are aware of their limitations and idiosyncrasies (be it Rolex or Seiko) then this watch is an easy choice. To revisit my earlier metaphor, while this may be hamburger in the world of automatic watches it's still a damn good hamburger.<br />  I'd just recommend ordering directly from Amazon as opposed to \\"fulfilled by Amazon\\" as I have mentioned earlier.<br />Hope this was helpful.
0345530578|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but not as good as earlier novels by Grisham. It took a little while to get moving, but once it did, it was fine. I did not have the urge however to get back to reading it as I did others..
B0050BPIB0|4.0|Girls, if you love the concept of the romantic Spanish speaker, you will love this album. Singing in Spanish is even more romantic. This guy is a heart throb.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I previously had a PowerGen external charger like this one but it broke. I saw how big the battery was and took a chance, and I was not disappointed. It worked like a charm, and I could go like 3 days with out charging my phone from the wall outlet with this.<br />PLUS Customer service was AMAZING. My first unit didn't work fully and I simply called and two minutes later they sent out a new one!!!!!!!!! Excellent experience and Excellent Product.
B001CT877Q|4.0|A well written action movie with interesting special effects. If you like Schwarzenegger (or even if you don't) this is a thrill-a-minute flick.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Great shopping on Amazon.com. Will definitely use in the future!! Got exactly what I wanted no complaints on this end
B005WUHAX8|1.0|. Does fine in water and easy to remove.Within the first week I dropped my phone with its lifeproof case and the screen shattered.
B004LWZW24|5.0|It was refreshing to watch a horror movie that actually made me jump a few times. There haven't been any recent horror movies that gave me the creeps. This one did without all the gore and nakedness. Love it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Finally found out what was going on with the characters, Grey finally gets over his past, and there is some good action, suspense, and romance... and of course the sex!  tee hee!  These books were not my usual style... I like them with a little less &#34;sexual&#34; typically but I thought I'd give these a try since they had such good ratings and all my friends were talking about them... I am a little too &#34;innocent&#34; for these types of books I think... but I did like this series... mostly for the storyline. :)  Great read!
1401924751|5.0|The accurate and amazing messages I get from this deck are comfortings and beautiful. This deck resonates so deeply with me, I now have 5+ decks and this is still one of my favorites.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very clear and concise. Challenges the old thought process in a gentle, yet effective way. It's near watching the subtle changes cause huge ripples in pool of life.
098478280X|5.0|The book helps for the interview. The book contains the questions about data structure and algorithms which are useful.<br />I love it.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Amazing movie, one of my favorites! A must have for any romantic movie buff who likes different and unique movies! Excellent condition and excellent packaging! Thank you!
1250037751|5.0|Great story, well written! I flew through it because I didn't want to put it down. The glow in the dark cover is a cute touch.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I do love the ability to walk around the house and use one of the buttons for my vent push to talk so I will be keeping the headset. I've searched the web for solutions to the popping / clicking but nothing has fixed it. Other than that it's a great headset.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Yes. Yes. Yes. Plot holes and tricky devices abound, as has been said. The positive aspects are nice visuals and a gritty, suspenseful pacing. Not to mention Michael Cane is brilliant in nearly everything he does. BUT Bane (although played by the very capable Hardy) is nearly unbelievable as a character in the &#34;real-world&#34; adaptations Nolan has seemingly striven toward. No one is going to meet the bar set by Ledger's Joker, but this is made starkly obvious in the extremely poor, nearly unwatchable Darth Vader-esque overdub of Bane's voice. If you give this another watch notice how the voice is never actually present in the scene but ALWAYS sounds as if it is in your - the onlooker's - room. To me, this is just downright lazy, and totally ruins any hope to be fully emersed in the batman universe. After the second movie, I expected more.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is super interesting as well as informative. Personally, it could use more dinosaurs though. And quests that don't cost so much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very twisted story that keeps you guessing until the very best. Crazy is the only way to describe it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|A great hidden object game. Great game play great graffics smooth scrolling.  Interesting story line. It is just a good game recomend to all
1608871452|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of the Series Supernatural.  It is quite clever and I liked it so much I want to order another one just to have a second copy.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|good hidden object game. finally. a g5 game that is free. if you don't mind playing for short intervals of time.  it takes a while to recharge energy.
1476727651|5.0|I got this as a birthday gift for my room mate who is a huge Stephen King fan.  It was fun while she read it because I kept getting updates as she went through the book.  She was not disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a fascinating story about two people who on the surface are quite ordinary, though we learn that Amazing Amy is much more than just ordinary. Some might not like the ending, but I thought it was fitting and definitely made me think about all the permutations of character develop that could occur in another novel. I can't wait to read other novels by this author.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Great tracks all around. Not your typical DP House music, but its as good or better depending on your mood.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|I really wanted to like this.  And there certainly are worse movies.  But I just kept thinking why go through all that trouble to do Rockem Sockem Robots vs The Giant Behemoths?  I started it Saturday night but after the first 15 minutes of mayhem decided I was too tired, maybe, to appreciate the subtle plot twists and back stories so paused and went to sleep.<br /><br />Today I started watching the season finale of Project Runway.  About a half hour into it I remembered Pacific Rim and that I only had 7 hours left to watch that before the rental period expired.<br /><br />Turned on Pacific Rim and found myself dozing off, took a nap, woke up and it was still rockem sockem robots vs whatever.  Remarked to self, \\"Self, it's pretty sad when Project Runway is more exciting than the big studio action flick.\\"  Gave it ten more minutes and switched to Project Runway.<br /><br />Yes I felt a tear of joy well up when Dom's line walked the runway because a star was born and a life was actually propelled into success.<br /><br />I don't know how Pacific Rim ended but I'm sure it all worked out in the end.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I was really starting to get into it when it disappeared off T.V. I wish they had did a couple more seasons before they canceled it. It died before it's time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A sexy book that actually gives the details . . . Not your grandmother's romance book. I highly recommend  especially if you are curious about a little S & M.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Surprising ideas of what children could be capable of. Page turner with great twists. Looking forward to more tales of Ender Wiggin!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to finally be able to play the real candy crush on my kindle.  Very fun and addictive to play.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Widely regarded as the best show that the Dead ever played, this set does not disappoint. The sound quality is top notch, and every song is either one of or the best version of it they ever played. Worth every cent.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put it down and highly recommend this book for anyone who oozes over romance and epic sex... just wonderful.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Although I have read several books about the holocaust, I don't think I have read a book from the point of view of an ordinary German citizen, let alone from that of a young girl.  This book provides valuable insight about life inside Germany but outside the Nazi party.  It is an exciting tale of daring and suffering.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is the game that makes every one happy. I love this game .I recommend this game to people that love hunting.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I have wanted to watch this film for awhile, but the timing never seemed right.  I don't watch very many movies.  I'm not looking to be distracted from life, I am looking to feel it more fully.  I like films and books that stretch me.  Five or ten minutes into this movie, I thought I was going to be one of those who got so bored they couldn't watch it.  I loved the images, but it hadn't penetrated inside me enough to hold me.  Later on I was thinking I could take my attention away to do something else, but in fact I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  The unfolding story had gotten into me, taken hold of me, and I was mesmerized by the beauty of what I was seeing and feeling.  I did pause it finally, but only because the intensity was too much for me--I needed to take a break and absorb it before going back.  After an hour or so I came back and finished it.<br /><br />I didn't get that this was a story about a dysfunctional family.  What I saw was a man who loved his family--it came through in everything he did--but also had a lot of pressure to take care of them, which conflicted with his own dreams.  As he said, he never missed a day of work, he tithed every week.  Yet, things went awry.  His beliefs collided with reality.  I saw a woman, who exemplified the female philosophy, at a time--in the '50s--when women didn't carry the pressure of providing financially for a family.  Their job was to nurture the family, and she did a good job of it.  To me, this movie was about a functional family, one that loved through the dreams and the sorrows, and that was the triumph of life in the end.  Many have said: to know that love is all there is, is all there is to know.  I didn't mind the \\"disjointed\\" stuff, because that's the way thoughts are--that's the only story in this moment, there is no past or future--the past is gone and the future never comes. Just thoughts about it.  Thoughts can be changed, and thus everything can be healed in the present moment.<br /><br />Brave.  Excellent job.  This movie left me feeling expanded.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was an adventure in life. Hard knocks, and the art of survival. I wish it was required reading for every teen. Vivian exhibited an adventurous zest for life, and was rewarded by a new family very late in her life.  I loved the book, and I am so glad to have it in my library.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|i love these old movies and seeing it color is that much better!!<br />I already had it in Black and White but new it would be so beautiful in color and it is!<br />I am waiting for the &#34;The Bishops Wife&#34; to be available in CD in Color now!!
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|I ordered this to watch with my three daughters ages 24, 20, 18. Wanted to bring back some great childhood memories. Watched it on a huge screen in a home theater and could not have been happier with the beautiful vivid colors and clarity! We just watched the newly released Little Mermaid and were not thrilled with the quality at all. Aladdin in blu-ray surpassed all our expectations!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so much fun and addicting. I think you should download this game. So that's why I picked this game.
B009LDD54K|5.0|I hope this series continues forever I have bought ever season so far and am looking forward to season four to be released..
1476733953|5.0|This book highly surprised me, and as soon as I started reading it I was hooked! I wasn't able to put it down, and was pulled in immediately by this well written story!
B008HK3RVY|5.0|I ordered this at the same time I ordered my new Nexus 7, but I wasn't sure if it would fit or not. At first, it was a really tight fit and was a little difficult to get out of the case. But after using it for a couple days, it stretched out a bit and now it goes in and comes out without any problems.<br /><br />Like any Timbuk2 thing I've ever owned, this is great quality. It's clear that my Nexus 7 is protected from scratches and bumps. I have no problem tossing this in my messenger bag or in the back seat. The best part is that I don't have any type of case that's adding bulk to the device. It's protected for traveling, but easy to handle when I'm using it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Best series of all time. This book is a fitting conclusion. Never wanted it to end and I still don't.
0316322407|5.0|Turn off that Psuedo Reality TV and get some REAL TALK about three great powers in the world:<br /><br />1)The Pen, 2)The Sword, 3)Women<br /><br />WOMEN are more powerful than the others! Malala (grief-stricken) got it going on. She has produced a remarkable story of courage about herself, and her fully supportive family. This young Pakistani girl knows how to stand up for her beliefs, and proudly represent all girls in the process.<br /><br />This book is a MUST READ for everyone globally who apires to do anything great. Many people in a country like the United States have one of the best ways of life in the free world thanks to the United States military. Many citizens are spoiled rotten by the culture and maintain no fight for anything except complaining about mostly meaningless events. And simply won't stand up for themselves. Like Malala says, \\"The Pen and the words that come from it can be much more powerful than machine guns, tanks, or helicopters.\\"<br /><br />If you as an adult \\"choose\\" to be illiterate then at least buy this book for your kids, especially your girls. Learn what happens when a young girl is hungry, and motivated to get an education and enjoy cultural freedoms. Malala died for a hot minute by the hand of the Taliban, and by the grace of Allah she is now BACK with a passion, and on a mission. A future Prime Minister in waiting. I think it's appropriate to say, YOU GO GIRL!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|It is remarkable that a book premised on the study of a time period I have thought almost nothing about could touch on so many topics I know very little about in a way that illuminated quite a bit of our country's history. There are notable absences (experiences of swathes of the population) but more remarkable is how much is contained and held my attention.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Memorizing names and dates in history class left me bereft of the deeper understanding of characters and situations that drove the outcomes.  This novel is compelling as a novel alone, but as a living history it is, for me, unsurpassed.  Thank you Ken Follett.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I find her extremely annoying!<br />I never had back pain till I did her workout!<br />Don't waste your time, you will not stay with it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Husband's Secret is mysterious tale that ties three women and their families together. At first, I didn't see a connection in the lives of: Cecillia, Tess, and Rachel. But, their paths eventually intersect at St. Angela's Primary School in Sydney, Australia.<br /><br />This intense story directly relates to the metaphor of opening Pandora's Box/Jar. A key character, Cecillia Fitzpatrick, contemplates whether (or not) she should open a secret letter addressed to her from her husband, John-Paul, in the event of his death. However, he's still very much alive and doesn't want her to read it. He wrote it one night confessing his sins while drunk.<br /><br />Should she open the letter against her husband's wishes?  Will opening the letter release some evil content upon her family and others around her? About halfway through the book, a huge revelation will occur. The aftermath has repercussions in store for the Crowleys, the Fitzpatricks, and the O'Learys.<br /><br />And at the end, the epilogue has an epic impact on these three families. It was a great example of the Butterfly Effect as one small change can produce different variations of one's future. Some jaw dropping possibilities were unveiled.<br /><br />My Rating: 4 Stars!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|As a historian I was impressed with Daniel Day-Lewiss performance. Besides resembling Lincoln his portrayal seemed real at least to my imagined Lincoln. The filmmakers did an excellent job finding actors that so ably fit the people they were portraying. I would love to see more of Sally Fields as Mary Todd-Lincoln, maybe an adaptation of Jean H. Bakers &#34;Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography&#34;. Her portrayal of this haunted women was breathtaking.<br /><br />It was interesting to see the similarities between now and then when it comes to how Congress works, just substitute &#34;Obamacare&#34; for the abolition of slavery and let the vitriol fly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the Lincolns, the Civil War, abolition, or the working of Congress.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Television's greatest tragedy is that this series was cancelled after only one season.  It is the best show EVER.  Sci-Fi, Steam Punk, Asian flair, everything you want in a fantasy series.  You grow to love the characters.  I watch this series over and over, including the feature film Serenity and never get sick of it.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This is like 3books in one.  The first part is like the creepiest thing I have ever read, and takes up most of the book. The next part is about his attempt to escape. The next part I will not reveal here, but it suddenly becomes science fiction combine with an ending you never saw coming.  A great book, if you ignore the inconsistencies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thrilled it's finally available for the Kindle.  Looks great &amp; plays as good as on Facebook!!!  Now if only Kindle would do something about Flash :-)
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Fantastic final season! Historical sound, epic in scope, I loved it! And regret that it is the end but what a way to go!!! Hats off to the cast, writers, directors, crew & Starz for bringing this series on! Great!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been eating Primal for about 3-1/2 months now and have lost 27 lbs. and feeling great.  But I was beginning to slip and crave and get bored.  So this week I bought a package of X-treme health low carb tortillas to make wraps and burritos for a change.  After eating 1 per day ( 4 grams net carbs) by the 3rd day I had gained 2 lbs. of bloat and had issues with gas that I hadn't experienced in months.  Realizing I hadn't gone over my 25 grams of carbs, the tortillas were the only thing I could think of that might be the culprit.  Ingredients: whole wheat flour, wheat flour. . .  Threw them away and 2 days later the bloat was gone and I decided to read Wheat Belly.  Learned a lot and it reconfirmed my decision to be grain free--only with lots more ammunition now when I consider cheating with anything with grains.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I would highly recommend this app. Great puzzles and, normally, has few problems. Still waiting for my Gold Pack however!
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Great special effects, but the movie was not very good. Very disjointed. Full of over acting, under acting, and just plain poor acting. It could not decide between being a serious sci-fi flick or a parody. I would recommend waiting for this to be free. Which should not be that too distant in the future.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|This show has got to be one of the funniest on tv right now. This season keeps right up with the first 3, doesn't miss a beat.
B001AITH50|4.0|Was a good movie worth watching. Makeup was excellent, locations were great. Liked the 2 main stars Tom Cruise, and Brad Pitt. Worth renting, or purchasing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its a great way to relax and enjoy some down time. Its gets more and more challenging as the levels move up. I don't  like needing to ask for tickets, but a lot of my friends and family enjoy this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it ....I wish I could pass level 165 though I've been stuck on it for along time now
B009DZDJU6|5.0|I was thoroughly surprised with this movie.  My husband and I thought ok, so this is going to be a waste of time and we really enjoyed it!  I thought they did a good job of putting historical information in the movie and how it tied into the storyline.  Great special effects and the setting in the 1800's was very well done.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find it very useful and informative. I can check my Kindle anytime and have current weather information. Don't know how I lived w/out it!
0316201545|5.0|Amazing and brilliant like I expected. I was overwhelmed with his capacity to surprise and entertain me even after the absolut success of The Wishing Spell. So happy with the news about the 3rd and 4th books for the series.<br />The Enchantress Returns was awesome and I'm already waiting for the next!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love, love love this show. The characters are great, the writing is interesting.  They don't string you along for too long on the subplots. The bad guys are fun to hate, the most proper are the funniest and there is always plenty going on at the big house. Hope they keep going for a few more seasons.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|As I began reading this book I was a little confused by the characters and their part in the story.  After reading a few more chapters I was hooked to find out what the Secret was.  An interesting form of writing and the way it ended stays with you.  Will definitely read more of Moriarty's books.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I guess I was expecting more. It does what is advertised. For the price it is a nice. Just wish I could stream more from my Nexus 7 and Android phone then just 4-5 apps! Stinks having to use a computer when I want to stream websites and other content and not be able to do so from a mobile device....
B006M4F67A|4.0|This ancient game is presented well for playing on the computer.  It has been a challenge to play, but enjoyed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it...love this game and very glad i can finally play on my kindle. its so much fun! thank you
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|Save yourself the trouble and go watch another series.  There is nothing but disappointment waiting for you.  It's LOST all over again.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|Nice weather app that provides pretty good weather details but it's not much different than other weather apps out there for free.
0545157617|5.0|Excellent book and service. My niece loves these stories and now has to have all the stories by this author before she goes to sleep.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad this is finally on kindle! So much better than on the computer. Just wish lives charged faster. But this is a great game that is highly addicting.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I love to watch Criminal Minds and I have every season so far and I plan to buy every other season that comes out. Thank You
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Tried to avoid it but had to give it a try. Addicted.  Think instructions could be much better.  Sort of flying by the seat of my pants. Don't understand 'lives' and why I must wait various lengths of time before I'm able to play.  Having said that I'm glad WiFi isn't needed so I can play anywhere.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is VERY fun, the best matching game. I really like it because my daughter plays it and she's three, so it's teaching her math.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|If you're a fan of this band, you'll love it. Geddy's voice is not what it used to be and there are several points were he is &#34;pushing&#34; it beyond what his cords can do. But as a fan, I can overlook this. If your not a fan, you will be very aware of it.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I've had the pulse for about 3 months. It's been close to rock solid so far. It only crashed twice in one day (right after the 2nd software update) and I lost about a day of data because I hadn't done the sync since before the update. The battery life is great, it lasts about 8 - 10 days, and it can fully charge during my hour drive to work. I seem to only use the heart rate function after exercising and not 100 times a day, maybe that attributes to the battery lasting well over a week. The graph it gives for sleeping is very fun to see, but I notice that sometimes it doesn't want to load on my iPhone or iPad (although it always works fine on the Health Mate website.) I read a lot of reviews where people say negative things because THEY forget to pay attention to where it is and wash it or have a hard time dealing with changing the mode for sleeping. I've not had too much of an issue with any of that. When I go to a water park I just seal it into a food saver bubble and don't have to worry one bit.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Recently my PS3 gamepad went and kicked the bucket while I was in the middle of playing GTA5. Obviously, this had to be rectified, and so I jumped on Amazon to order me a game pad.<br /><br />I was presented with two options! One being to pick up a generic game pad, and the second being to grab an official game pad! I decided the smartest thing to do, was go official! Yes, the generic ones were much MUCH cheaper, but I have used generic gamepads in the past for other systems, and let's just say they were never a good experience.<br /><br />I got it home and it worked as intended. It has the rumble feeling that you either love or you hate, and fits perfectly in the palm of your hand!<br /><br />It looks like previous versions of the Dual shock controllers, so is obviously a format you are most likely familiar with, and while it DOES look like the same pad used on the PS2, this is completely different and will NOT be compatible for the PS2, this is for the PS3, However if you are playing PS1 or PS2 games on your PS3 console, this will still work!<br /><br />Overall, I firmly believe that this is the best PS3 console controller available on the market. Well worth the extra cost over that of the generic version.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Playstore version has constant pop up adds. So far not happening with the amazon app store version. Having lots of challenging fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! I can play on my Kindle. I have this game in my iPhone and now can play twice as much!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Very fun to watch, with plenty of twists and turns to keep your attention. The scenery is beautiful and the graphics are top-notch too.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Do not like the graphics on the hourly forecast. Difficult to view and navigate. Previous version was much better! Wish it would update and lose the busy graphics.
B000002GAF|5.0|I love Gino Vannelli, I saw him back in Montreal in the good old days and it was the best. Bought the cd because my album was destroyed in a flood...just love it.
140006922X|3.0|Aslan, writes a book that is worth reading.  As many other reviewers state there is really nothing new here.  I have a Master's in History which is what prompted me to read this work.  The work is well researched and the sources are documented.  As a historian I feel there were parts which were giving only a perfunctory look of the \\"times\\" of Jesus and the beginning of the Christian faith.  As a Christian who has served in the Middle East, I definitely was able to see that this work was written by an author who had a grounding in Islam.  Having said that, for any one with an open mind this is a book worth examining.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad that my favorite game is now available for download on my kindle fire, however, a strong internet connection is required to connect to my facebook to maintain my progress in the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I don't know why. I have an addiction to it that is unable to explain. It never has problems and doesn't shut down or glich. I have so much fun playing it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It can be very addictive, especially when you first start. Sometimes it glitches out on me, but other than that it's one of the rummest games if have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Better than the Facebook version and worth the wait! Beautiful graphics, bright colors and the ability to get extra lives from friends make this more user friendly.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I love this game! My kids and I are hooked on it...however when the updates installed for the halloween graphics...it started freezing and crashing my Kindle. We've had no trouble with it up until now. And it will freeze so bad that sometimes the Kindle won't even restart. Please fix this.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|The first time I read it, I thought I already knew the majority of the information, and found the book INTERESTING.  The second time through, I was teachable, and found it LIFE CHANGING.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a super fun and highly addictive game to play. Great for killing time. I wouldn't recommend playing before bed. You may be up longer than you realize!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this game is very fun and very addicting. So glad it finally came out for the kindle fire.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I'm still reading it.  It came highly recommended by a friend.  Even though I haven't finished it, I already love it.
B000I5XOW8|4.0|an intensely powerful developing drama--both harrison ford and tommy lee jones were terrific in their roles and developing interactions--good supporting cast and a very  riveting developing storyline
0141034599|5.0|Absolutely brilliant view of what many think will never happen, until it does! I had never heard of this theory until reading this book, now use it in my work and personal life regularly
B003ASLJRW|4.0|a very intriguing movie--clint eastwood at his best here--great developing plot and fitting ending,again the developing character actions were very  well done and acted out
B00992CF6W|4.0|I want to know how to update it they also  should put caves redstone and switches<br />and every thing that has to do with Redstone and minecarts  and minecart rails<br />and enderman
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|love  this entire series powerfully--looking for more to come,the ongoing character relationships are ever changing--keeping my inerest very strong as it goes
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I haven't stopped playing since I downloaded this game. Pretty awesome. Thought I had downloaded it for my 5 year old but no it's now my game.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game for kids but it seem to be skiping during the game and its annoying! I love the halloweeness of the game its cute!
1451695195|5.0|Husband says book is VERY interesting. He is a pastor and tries to relate these stories. Received it very quick too.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|this is a awesome game and it keeps me from being stress out very casual I really like this game and I will recommend this to other people specially if you play candy crush then you would need this game to bring down your stress level lol!
B002O3Z50Q|3.0|The Iliad is handled rather roughly in several places, and Brad Pitt is too moody for a Greek hero.  Eric Bana does a fine job, though.<br />This Helen is lovely, but I doubt if her face would launch a thousand ships and burn the topless towers of Ilium.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game really fun about time Amazon got  this app for the kindle fire been a long time a conning for this app
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Laughter, sadness, tears, and triumph!  Who could ask for more in a movie!  The wife should really get much credit for the humor in this tale.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thanks for allowing this great game on kindle fire. It can be addictive.  now I can take it wherever I go.
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|My daughter teaches history and shows parts of this to her classes.  It may be an old movie, but it's a good one,.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This is a great book, I have zipped through it, am going to look at other books by this author.
0670024813|4.0|This book isn't intended to be a scholarly look at life among non-modern peoples, so critics might say it is not good information.  I think it is because it introduced me to some new ideas and led me to look up information elsewhere to collaborate what he said.  There were times I couldn't find this information, but that doesn't lower the value of the book to me.  I am a fan of books that give an &#34;overview&#34; of a subject (hence the &#34;Dummies&#34; in the headline above), and Diamond does this quite well.  I have other books by him.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Night addictive. Perfect for those days when you need a mindless game when you need a break from reality. I highly recommend this game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome.<br />If you ever wondered, this is the book for you.<br />All the little twists and nuances make this book difficult to put down.  You want to keep on reading.<br />Shine On.
0385349947|5.0|I wish this would have been required reading in my early 20's. It was still pretty good for my mid 30's too. Overall, it's a gentle shove on the modern version of political correctness vs. traditional gender roles debate. Every chapter has a relatable story both from an entry level job and a high level career perspective. This would be a great book for women to read together so they can share similar experiences. I read it week by week one chapter at a time and these elegant life lessons sunk in. I'm also reading &#34;I shouldn't be telling you this&#34; and I think that would be an excellent follow up book to this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I HAVE MY OWN HORSE THAT I CAN CANTAR BAREBACK SO WHEN I'M NOT WITH MY HORSE THIS IS THE BEST GAME TO PLAY. RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game for all ages my kids love hatching the eggs and feeding the animals. Great game for a family.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Heard a couple of her songs on Pandora and really enjoyed them.  Looked her up on youtube and found her music videos, which are fantastic as well.  Her dancing and appearance adds another level of awesome to already great music.  Had to have the tracks for my own so I picked up this album.  I listen to them often when I'm studying, and it helps keep me from getting bored and irritable without distracting me from what I'm reading.  I think my favorite songs from the album are &#34;Shadows&#34;, &#34;Crystallize&#34;, and &#34;Song of a Caged Bird&#34;.  I believe she has a re-release of this album coming out soon that has bonus tracks and such, so I would recommend that as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just like the other versions I have played on phone and computer, only I LOVE having it for the kindle! finally!
B008EL25LE|5.0|A really enjoyable adventure that finds a nice balance of story, movement and variety.  I played through it relatively quickly and that says something for my style of play.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I don't care who you are, how old you are, whether you like dogs or not.... you are going to cry when you see this movie.  This story will touch you because we are all deeply touched when we witness true love and loyalty, even if it's from a dog.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Its GIBBS.  really just add it to your collection so when your cable or sat goes out you can always watch GIBBS
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Out of all the Step Up movies, this movie is my absolute favorite.  Many dance movies, strangely, have a little bit of dancing in it, but not Revolution.  From beginning to end, the movie is not only filled with dance, BUT INCREDIBLE DANCE.  Beautiful and original choreography, you'll leave wanting to cut a rug.
B008JFUO72|4.0|Include the HULK, Capt America and The Avengers.  Lots of referances back and forth you dont want to get lost in the plot
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book.  It transported me to another place and time so convincingly, I found it difficult to put down.  I seriously hope to see more in this setting.  will be looking at more from this author right now!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I saw the original series when it first came out and the way these carictors are you cant help but love this second movie in the series
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Once again Zac Brown Band delivers great music! You won't be disappointed if you order this CD! Thanks for another wonderful cd
B002G917ZK|5.0|Wonderful love story in scenic  1961 NYC .  Audrey Hepburn's extensive Givenchy wardrobe must be seen. The movie can be a great inspiration for fashion design students.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker is great in any style of music he sings. The man never lets me down! Keep the songs coming!!
B003XMWSSY|5.0|The self publisher would be advised to consider this instruction before delivering a regrettable work.<br /><br />Valuable if you already have a manuscript or if you have yet to begin.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great story. Enjoyed the show so picked up these books. Not disappointed. Can't wait to get through the series. Awesome!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought it because of Journey but I think it's a great deal. I have seen reviews for all the games and I am ready to give them a try!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is really fun. it has an awesome amount of tracks and vehicles. its addicting and made great for everyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|While I again felt the sting of a child being exploited, Orson put together a very well thought out story that goes beyond humanity and looks at life in other worlds. Ender's Game is very well written and imaginative of a future world not to far off in the distant future. I can't wait to read the remaining books.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Bought for the hubbie, but find it facinating to play. I like the realism.  The scenerey is fantastic and real.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great series! It is truly like a breath of fresh air! Thanks for writing Wool, I can't wait to read on!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|grew up on this movie and now my niece watches and sings along. i waited for the blu-ray instead of the dvd might as well get the best quality
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Seasons 1 and 2 had me on the hook. I loved the story lines and the character developments.  The third season seemed like Fellows was trying too hard to trump the previous season rather than let the viewers delight in the interactions between the families and society.  The three weakest plot points tended to dominate the season and not for the series' betterment.  I still enjoyed seeing the characters I came to admire on the screen and now after the conclusion of Season 3, I know I will come back for more - even if just to see Mr. Carson help make sense of it all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was hesitant at first to invest in this chromecast technology because I own a Playstation 3 and my parents use a roku, I have been pleasantly surprised at how much I use it. I own an iPad and I really like the convenience of simply opening my Netflix app and streaming it to my TV while I lay in bed on facebook, reading for class, etc... I also like to put pandora up on my TV, or to show my roommate a webpage when we're studying for class in our living room (We own multiple). I would suggest this over using a roku, or other streaming devices simply because of cost. More than likely you own a computer, laptop, and/or tablet and all you need is to install the chrome browser and the chromecast add-on and you're all set!
1451695195|1.0|If you believe that Jesus is Lord and the only way to heaven than this book is not for you.  If you believe in other gods like Orb and Omn than you will love the book.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I plan on purchasing this one for the video library.  I truly enjoyed this one.  Awesome movie and the giants were something else.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I bought this for my husband to read on his Kindle. Though we've not read it yet, I know it will be awesome, odiously because it's by J.K. Rowling!:) After he reads it, I'll be reading it for sure. I know we'll both love it! Can't wait! :)
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Wonderful read. Like a tree, so many branches to explore. I felt it to be rich and powerful, and highlighted many passages for further reflection.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|I really enjoy the demo. It's been keeping my interest,  Controls are precise and non-frustrating. I might even spring for the paid version someday.
1423136802|5.0|THE BEST WRITER EVER I RECCOMEND THIS WRITER ALWAYS (WRITTEN by son of this guy) this made me want to read more and more
B00AW8UK0K|3.0|Michael Mosely should stick to broadcasting! This book does little to add any depth or science to his notion that intermittant fasting is good for you. I'm on the programme and bought the book to learn more, sadly this was a waste of money. The concept of the diet is just to eat less two days a week. You don't need lists of calorie content or sample diets - just fast!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting  to get this game.  Now I  just need to figure out why I can't connect with facebook.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|After having spent hundreds of dollars on so called security software and having problems with Trojan horse virus and system crashing, I finally tried this after a co-worker (who works in IT) recommended it.  I have now used it for the last 5 yrs and have had no problems at all.  I receive notices if there is any suspicious spyware or anything.  I'm very satisfied with it.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Overall very good.  This season starts off a bit too campy and silly, and I don't care much for the Doctor's personality initially.  BUT, as the story unfolds (as well as the character development), I began to love the season.  You have to get past the first few episodes which were just alright (with one pretty terrible one).  By the end, I am a fan of Rose and the Doctor.  I was hooked and I wanted more.  It just gets better.
1592289444|1.0|I did not hate this book but gave it one star because it is so preposterous and insulting to the thinking reader. In fact, midway through the Gobi, at about the time of the oasis which was kind of like a fourth-class Sandals resort, I really loved it and thought it would rate a five star review.<br /><br />I love true adventure stories and get inspired by other people's courage and resourcefulness. For those of you who also enjoy books like that, try Adrift by Steven Callahan, And I Alone Survived by Lauren Elder and Almost Too Late by Elmo Wortmann. That I have read these more than once may tell you how good they are. The Long Walk is not in this category.<br /><br />I should have known this was a work of fiction when the camp commandant's wife suggested escape, repeatedly talked about escape, and eventually facilitated escape. This is bogus unless she was intent upon committing suicide by firing squad. Then we have the addition of a beautiful girl, found hiding in some bushes in the snow and survival through the Gobi desert with essentially no water. I can hardly drive from here to the grocery store without water.<br /><br />Add to that mix the scaling of the Himalayas in winter without water and food, wearing homemade moccasions with no climbing gear, and you know this is a fabrication. The final straw is NOT ONE WORD OF CONFIRMATION of this crazy epic from the other supposed survivors. If I had done something like this, I would have written my own book and talked with Edward R. Murrow, Larry King, Oprah, and David Frost. Not a word from any of the others. RED FLAG.<br /><br />Had the \\"author\\" been a little smarter, he would at least have killed off everyone else in India and solved that problem.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining work of fiction and nothing more. It should never have been passed off as the truth.<br /><br />PS  If they had really taunted the Yetis they would have ended up under 10 feet of packed snow. I learned that from watching the beef jerky commercial.rky commercial.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|The only thing I don't like is the cut throat dialog used every episode -_- Other than that, great show. Good acting, creative camera work for a drama. Great character development. And of course, the characters are impeccably dressed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its good. Ive enjoyed reading it especially collins' first book. I want to read the third book as well. Haha
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I race with my dad to see who can get through them the fastest! cant wait for more levels to come out!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book and the unexpected turns the story took.  I was not sure how I would feel about the story from the blurb but it sucked me in and I could not stop reading it.  I didn't want to leave for work, I just wanted to stay home and read.  The end was extremely unexpected!  Hurry and get this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I think this game have a whole lot of<br />levels.!I think this game is kind of hard. But so far the<br />first few levels were easy. THIS IS THE BEST GAME<br />EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Seldom does an author come out of the gate so strongly. Craig Johnson combines a mythical aspect in this first Walt Longmire novel with his tangible setting of Absaroka County Wyoming, described in lyrical phrases, and a real-to-life character who is flawed and adored. Sumptuous writing.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Well researched topical thriller from the master of his craft. I've enjoyed every one of Mr. Forsyth's books and this one does not disappoint
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was picked by our book club to read. I had never read this author before. I really enjoyed this book, so many twists and turns. Just as I thought I had the plot figured out, another twist would happen. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to be kept on the edge of their seat!
B00CIVLZ3U|3.0|I was hooked by the sample chapters and bought the book before it came out. Compared to them, the book was a slight disappointement. Minus the central premise (which I found cool), it is yet another coming-of-age story: a young man avenges his father, falls in love which is to be resolved at some later point.<br /><br />Not just to complain, it was a smooth read and a good revenge story. The setting was really well worked out and the resolution was satisfactory - part of it was expected, part of it wasn't.<br /><br />What makes the story tick are the Epics and the consequences of having too much power. There's many supervillains and no superheroes. One has to wonder what would happen if powers of that kind appeared... food for thought.<br /><br />If another book comes out, I might get it.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Classic Earth, Wind & Fire. This CD is both mellow and funky. If you are an true EW&F fan you will love this CD. The instrumentals are awesome  This CD is a must buy.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|AN UNEXPECTED END BUT SPARKS CAUSES ME TO HOLD ON TO THE CONCEPT OF TRUE LOVE. IT EXISTS ALTHOUGH NOT HOW AND WHERE WE'D LIKE BUT IT'S HERE NONETHELESS
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Why would you need a $35 Chromecast when the TV or Bluray player does the same thing?  Quite simply these so-called smart-TVs or smart devices suck.  They are like wireless phone carriers and smartphone manufacturers putting their own bloatware, adware, and then never bothering them to update their software after their products' release.  With a Chromecast, the compatible app on your iOS or Android device will always be updated and will have a much better interface and more features than anything a TV or \\"smart-device\\" manufacturer will release, maybe excepting Apple TV and the Roku (which I have not tried personally).<br /><br />Since I own both an iPad and an Android phone, I can attest that setting up the Chromecast is a little easier on the Android on its respective Chromecast app, but certainly not difficult on the iPad, which requires disconnecting from your WiFi network to connect to the Chromecast.  Also, you can use an Android device to stream music from your Google Play Music cloud storage, but not from your device unfortunately.  I did have an issue of not having any songs playing since they were both on my phone and on the cloud, but it had been resolved recently.<br /><br />Some gripes I have is that the included HDMI extension cable is not flexible enough to hide behind the side of the TV.  Also, Chromecasting from a Chrome browser is a bit of a miss.  While online video playback is okay, there is a bit of a delay when scrolling through web pages.  Chromecasting from a Chrome browser utilizes a lot of CPU power on my 2011 MacBook Air, and revs up my cooling fans.  So if you wan't a quiet web streaming experience, I'd probably recommend a faster computer, an Apple TV + Mac / iOS, a compatible Chromebook, or a very quiet HTPC.
140006922X|4.0|I found this book to be quite interesting, and generally worthwhile. The title however is somewhat misleading. What this book is really about is the political environment in the Holy Land and surrounding areas for the roughly 150 year period before and after Jesus' birth. In the book, you will learn about the structure of the Jewish communities of antiquity, the influence they had on the Roman Empire and vice versa, and the role each played in allowing Jesus' movement to gain traction after his death. You will also learn about the various self-proclaimed messiahs and prophets of his time (of which there were many), and why those movements were relative failures if not outright failures. This book is really not about Christianity, belief, religious virtue, or even really Jesus' life. I think it's about the times during which he lived and the circumstances surrounding the rise of 'new' Jewish thought that was a precursor to Christianity. Therefore, the subtitle, \\"The Life and Times\\" should really just be \\"The Times\\" because this is not a biography. Do not read this book expecting to change your mind or anyone else's with regard to religious devotion. This is a fairly balanced attempt to look at the history of Jesus' life and where certainty does not exist it is not claimed.
B005S9ELY4|3.0|This has just enough action, CGI, violence, and witty dialogue to keep anyone from hating it.  Considering how many old L.A. crime stories have been done, the film has it's own appealing look, but not much new in terms of story or characters.  The biggest problem is Sean Penn.  No matter how many people he disembowels or burns alive, he exerts way too much effort to seem truly menacing.  A villain needs to make violence seem calm and effortless, but not detached like a Tarantino character.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This is a good app for downloading documents, but it doesn't let you play on games you could on the computer. I recommend that if you are looking for an app that lets you play on a computer game, don't download this app.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat! Even when I decided Jacob was guilty, I would be confronted with reasonable doubt that he was not. Ending was totally unexpected!
B0012DP8A6|5.0|what a nice walk through the past. great love story. and I have to add some more words to this
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I just want to tell one word: SUPERB. Game is great,  my 5 year old son loves it. Great graphics playability and fun
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is exelent because it looks so real sometimes even on the ipad Ipod or iphone hthey are all Thames and it doesn't gen mater because its free
B00F91RYL8|2.0|it would have been a good movie had it not had zombies in it.  We couldnt stop laughing at them. It was hard to believe that they were real and were the bad guys
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun needs more excitement . More goals to reach . Have tons of cool missions for us to do. I like playing subway surfers but sometimes want more excitement
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Far exceeded my expectations.  Had a several references to the old star trek.  I highly recommend the movie to any die hard trekkie and even those who are just discovering this genre.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem at his best! I can only hope his new album is half as good as this one. Do work!
B00DW1WR14|2.0|this is the kind of album that you just gone to listen a couple times... hey its to slow, is just marketing now! soundgarden released a better album the last year keeping the style making stupid videos but nice :) and this lighting bolt is very hard for many pearl jam fans because we don't believe in pop, we still believe in grunge! this is should be an EP whit 4 songs that's it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited for this book and pre-ordered it to make sure it arrived and I could continue the story from the 2 books prior (which I loved).  I was reading it and realized...there was so plot!  There was lots of sex (a good thing) but no story line. Nothing was resolved or explained from the first 2 books. Eva and Gideon never had a true heart to heart conversation about him killing for her, it was like it was of no importance. I hope in the next books the author has read these reviews and attempts to make a better storyline and actually has Eva and Gideon talking to one another.
B003U4UNR8|5.0|I love this show!  Best character development Ive seen!  Even though some things were a bit wierd and didnt make sense, it still kept me interested and I saw every single episode... in order!  Not too many shows capture my interest like that!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love all the actors in this movie. Lots of action from characters that aren't so young anymore! I also ordered Red 2.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive. Fun for all! Love trying to complete each level. My kids enjoy it too. Can be frustrating at times.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The DVD was very cool.  i've shown it to several of my friends and they laughed at the funny ones, too.  Really good cinematography and settings.  This crew is a riot.
B00EDX5QRW|5.0|So amazing. Solid record. Rock City and Beautiful War are my favorites but it's all great. I hadn't been into their style as much the last few years but they made a comeback with this record. Buy it!
B00991TCOG|4.0|Not normally what I listen to but the videos hooked me.  Lindsay needs to put out DVD with her videos on it with her next album.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It is one of the useless devices. Do not buy it unless one is clear why does he needs it.
1416549447|5.0|This is an awesome guide to running better. Even though I don't believe Chi Running to be the key to everything, as the author states, I do believe that it is a great way to make running more efficient and enjoyable.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|So we picked this up at the book store this weekend. My daughter, a Kindergartener, was sooo tickled by this book. We seem to have a nightly conversation about putting away or otherwise taking better care of crayons, which I find myself purchasing a couple of times per month, so this book helped me drive home the point that your crayons deserve more \\"respect.\\" Admittedly, I added the words \\"I Quit!\\" to the end of each letter written by the crayon to Duncan, and she thought it was hysterical! I think some of the negative reviews are from people who take it a little seriously. The crayons are whining a little because they are asking Duncan for variety, fair and equal treatment, and to be better taken care of. And to the author's credit, he also added a thank you letter from a happy crayon, and asked Duncan to sort out a disagreement between 2 other colors, and ultimately, Duncan's solution was to think outside of the box to make everyone happy, with a beautiful ending result. I'm not great at writing reviews but I hope this helps someone.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|So far I like this app but it should have more pictures before you have to buy more. Otherwise this is a fair beginning. More categories would be nice to have to choose from.
B000OXHRRC|1.0|The video did not work - it continually paused and we had to go back out and restart the movie.  It was very annoying and took so much time that we did not finish the film in the time allotted.<br /><br />We would like a credit if possible.  The story was good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game should be a 1,000,000 star game.I have it and its AWESOME.For all you people that want this game,GET IT NOW!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Perfect read for a day<br />Has everything you need, learn about life and what you want to do in life what ever that might be it can be done if you just believe.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love the first season, can't wait to get to the second season.  This show just keeps getting better with each episode.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|When a rogue intelligence officer assassinates Federation leaders, Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are sent on a dangerous mission into Klingon space to hunt down the criminal. However, as the plot unfolds we learn that the renegade is none other than Khan, a genetically enhanced tyrant from the Eugenics wars who has been frozen in stasis for the last few hundred years.<br /><br />Star Trek: Into Darkness is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end. J.J. Abrams has successfully rebooted the franchise in \\"Action Adventure\\" mode. Hardly five minutes of screen time goes by without a fist fight or chase or an explosion. It is all well done, the effects are first rate and the audience is hardly given time to catch their breath or think.<br /><br />And, from my perspective, therein lies the problem. For me, as I suspect for most long time Star Trek fans, my love of the series has always been about the ideas. In scrapping this aspect, J.J. Abrams has taken out much of what made Star Trek so appealing.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about this without sounding pedantic, but, for example, let's take scientific terminology. There's always been a fair amount of technical jargon in the Star Trek lexicon. But up until now it's always made some kind of sense and been part of a carefully thought out and self-consistent fictional universe. In this film, however, when someone refers to a device that turns everything into ice as a \\"cold fusion\\" generator, it reveals not only what a painfully weak grasp of science the writers have, but also how far from Gene Rodenberry's original conception the franchise has slid.<br /><br />If it weren't for the cast, this dumbed-down over-amped approach would probably ruin the film. However, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are well cast as Kirk and Spock and rest of the crew turn in solid and energetic performances which make the movie enjoyable.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. It's hard not to feel nostalgia for Ricardo Montalban's rendition of this character who appeared the original series episode Space Seed and later in The Wrath of Khan. Into Darkness' hectic pace gives Cumberbatch very little time to craft a well-rounded portrayal, but he brings such a magnetic presence to the screen, that he steals every scene.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|It's a good game but the downloading is horrible I had to delete all my apps just for this one
1439152810|5.0|It was definitely a page turner!  I couldn't put it down and  I loved the surprise ending.  A good mystery without the homicide angle.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Pretty fun addictive game. Can play on an  offline with friends or without. If you like Berkeley this is another  game very similar to that.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This production of Jane Eyre is my favorite among the many that I have seen.  I enjoyed it for it's beauty and emotionally satisfying performances.  The chemistry between the lovers is evident and believable in this production.
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|I haven't watched this concert, but have all the preceding 3 others on DVD, and I will most certainly buy this fourth one, and any more in future that Eric will organize for this noble cause of recovery from addiction. The only reason I give it 4 stars is, I find the invitees to be more or less the same guitar players. And some are not my favorites at all - Jimmy Vaughan or Los Lobos for instance. I just wish Eric would invite other guitar players too - Steve Lukather and Robben Ford come to my mind. Having said that, the concerts are generally first rate and if you even have anything remote to do with the guitar, you won't be disappointed!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I guess I love all things Star Trek!  The only thing that could  make it better would be more cameos of the original cast.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a vast improvement over the stock keyboard. Having multiple devices is becoming the norm and SwiftKey helps with that in a big way by tying the key entries of those devices together to better enable the word predictions. My only quibble is the lack of arrow keys on the tablet app.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I bought this movie to replace an old copy I had that digitized out on me. I don't do this unless the movie is well worth it. Having been to Gettysburg several times, I was familiar with the location and terrain and enjoyed seeing the re-enactments at the actual locations. I never understood the method of fighting back then, standing in front of hundreds of muskets and hoping you get blown away. But the action, direction and tactics were as authentic as I could imagine them to be. I'm not going to break down every actor's contribution - suffice to say they all did an outstanding job. If you are into the development of this great country, this is a need to have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game but it is highly addictive so I also hate this game. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B000WCDBKM|1.0|Well that was two hours of my life I'll never get back. I kept watching hoping things would pick up.  Bad acting for the most part.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|Well, let me just state at the beginning that I do like Sanderson as a writer. Because of his continuation of WOT I read 'Elantris', 'Warbreaker' and the 'Mistborn' triology and they were all great (accept of maybe the last installment of 'Mistborn'). I also like WOT 12+13, and was therefore hoping for an awesome final...<br />Unfortunately, this is the first book from Sanderson I dislike. I re-read all the books for maximal enjoyment (and I loved the re-read even of the ones which have a slower pace), and hit a major letdown for the first 1/4 of MOL. I had a hard time recognizing my heroes (somehow they were acting and talking strange...) and the story line was very close to 'not believable'. The whole thing just did not fit. *SPOILER* Just one example is the assault on Camelyn and Rand does not even consider to go there and rescue the people (like say something similar to Maradon where he killed thousands of trollocs just by himself). But of course that's what the shadow wants (might be a trap), so let's not help but instead cuddle up with Avienda... REALLY??!! Also, how easy Elayne gains control over the armies of the light (I mean she is just a kid.... and pregnant!!!). And the quick idea of the Aiel POLICE??? This Dragon Peace business was a little naive as a plot in my opinion anyway.<br /><br />The book got a little better after that. I did like the assault on the great captains, which made the war finally interesting, but agree with other reviewers that this was a clumsy mistake by the armies of the light to not protect those brilliant heads. From there everything goes down hill:<br /><br />- the bad guys are weak AND stupid (Demandred, Taim, Lanfear, Greandal, etc.) (the sword play between Demandred and Gawyn, etc. was plain stupid! WHY???)<br />- the dark one is a nice guy for a chat over tea<br />- a lot of the main characters are simply not doing anything<br />- Fain is killed off in a couple of sentences at the end just as an after thought really (why have him in the first place, that did not make any sense???)<br />- It seemed already a little too much how Egwene 're-discovered' Traveling, but this anti-balefire weave was a little sudden for my taste. Also, how did she know right at this minute (before committing to suicide) when to destroy the seals? Did she dream it right then?<br />- the whole thing with Mat, the Seanchan and Rand seemed rushed.<br />- I also found the story line towards giving Matt total control over the armies not quite believable. That was too easy... (the whole world is at stake and Matt is the only one....)<br />- the ending was just BAD, everything about it seemed fake.<br /><br />In my opinion Sanderson tried so very hard to BE Jordan, which of course can't work. By doing so the storyline and believability of the character's actions suffered greatly. Thank you Mr Sanderson for trying, but on second thought I don't think anyone could have pulled this off the way we fans wanted it to be (maybe not even Jordan himself...). What a shame though..;(
B004RKXN44|5.0|Nalini Siingh is the best author I've read in years! Both her series, Psy-Changling and Guild Hunter, are must reads! And this is the best book in the series. It could have been a total let down after all the buildup but it went beyond expectation! I now own both the hardcover and the kindle versions!
B00AECGQF2|2.0|I do not care for this it is just not fun to play, there are some better games to play will not play this game at all, thank you though for trying!
B008EL25LE|5.0|This game is great for the terrific graphics and ease of use.  It's not hard to figure out how to play and it's very enjoyable.  It met all of my expectations and more.  I think anyone that chooses to buy this game will be greatly surprised.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Minecraft is awesome. You can place blocks to build whatever you want and in survival you can mine for diomonds, battle monsters, and build homes, villages, kingdoms, and much much more. I totally think you should buy this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it, the graphics rule, awesomness all around me and my family loves it also. I give this game 5 stars :D
1442359315|5.0|His voice is perfect for audio books. The NDE was laid out perfectly. I would encourage all to check it out.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|This is great record! My favorite's so far are Alligator, On my way to work, new, and looking at her. Can't stop listening.
1401940676|3.0|I was hoping for more information regarding her NDE and the majority of the story was a biography. If I had known that I would have just stuck with what I learned on You Tube
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|granny Smith is a great game and every one should give it a try.  it is actually my favorite game of all times and once you play this game you will never want to stop playing. I have never player a game like it before and now i have. you will love it.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|Like the shifting, reminds me of my first car.  If you have ever raced a friend to see who has the fastest car and the quickest reflexes, you.'ll love this game.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|One of the few CD's I've gotten in a very long time where I can listen the whole way through.  I keep this one in my car.  The digital donnload was cool too, so I can play it from any digital device where I have Amazon MP3.  I think I added it to itunes also.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Bingo Blitz I used to enjoy your game a lot. Since you have come out with new rooms that has nongiftable collections it has gotten to be aggravating. Why do we have teammates if we can't help one another? I must say your new Halloween room, Frankenblitzy sucks because it's impossible to complete. Bingo Blitz you have disappointed me and you need to get it together before people decide to quit playing.
B00E688KA4|4.0|Not bad. Better then the last few albums they had. But it did have a few week tracks on the album.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|But then again my last backpack was a freebie from 3M<br />this one has all the bells and whistles<br />super padded and looks like a spot for everything<br />there is even a hole for your headphones to exit<br />I'm impressed.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie created the most compelling fantasy series I've ever read. If you haven't already, pick up The First Law Trilogy and don't stop until you get to Red Country.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have read many articles in magazines and books about exercising the brain with games, puzzles, etc. to keep it sharp.  Well, this game is one of them for sure.  Every level of this game is different, some are easy while others are really hard to complete! This involves quick thinking plus strategic moves to clear the blocks.  Believe me you will not get bored but addicted. I played it on Facebook then purchased it for my Kindle.  Now I can play it anywhere I go.
0385743564|5.0|The story was fast paced from start to finish. The ending has twists that are simple and logical, yet I found myself thinking &#34;how did I not see that coming&#34;. I generally gauge reads by the captivating nature of the book.  This book was difficult to put down. I found myself looking forward to getting back to the story.  My only problem with the book is not having the second book in the series...like now!
0143039431|4.0|I was part of a family that left Oklahoma in 1938.  I did not know anything about the difficulties encountered by poor folks trying to find a better life in the west.  Steinbeck was a deep thinker and expert writer.  I got awfully tired of the filthy language and had to quit reading it to my wife because of that.  I cannot disregard the fact that the language in the book was any different than the language of the people described.<br />  As i look back and remember that my father driving a 1928 Pontiac and pulling a homemade trailer landed at his brother's rented house in Tacoma with five dollars in his pocket.  The automobile was a gift from his elderly aunt.  We lived together with my uncle and his family in a one bedroom house for two months.  There were ten of us.<br />  I am glad that we went to WA and not to CA.  We were not mistreated in anyway.  The book brings back a lifetime of memories totally different than the history recorded by a great author like Steinbeck.<br />  I now live in a community with streets named for authors.  I live on Steinbeck Dr.  Ben Around
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|This movie actually takes place before Dorothy fell out of the sky.  Really cool and quite amusing in some places.  Kept moving, no boring parts.  Kept you watching through the whole thing.  I was trying to crochet but finally just gave up and just watched the movie.  Great.

B009MYARIK|3.0|I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's books, but this was just an ok read - I can see it being made into a cute rom-com and the ending is certainly sweet, but it was fairly predictable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so flippin excited about candy crush now available on my kindle fire!!!!!!!!! I absolutely love this game, it's so addictive and so much fun..... THANK YOU!

B003UBTX7C|4.0|Thank once again for another great book!  Can't wait for the next one.  It must be a treat to finish then start another...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have one at home and one in the office, and we're buying more for the office. When giving presentations, anyone can take over and project their screen without hassle. Attaching it to the ceiling mounted projector works well too -- no more tedious plugging and unplugging.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|With the rated 6000 mAh battery inside, this is one on the physically larger side of the slim power packs available on Amazon (see Anker Slim2 and EasyAcc Ultra-Slim), but it is nominally narrower and shorter than the Galaxy S4, at about the same thickness. The built-in cable comes out from one corner, so it can flexibly be attached to a bottom, top or side charging port of a phone and the phone can still be used with it attached (hint: rubber band the phone to the power pack, and when not in use, leave the rubber band around the power pack, ready for use).<br /><br />Beside the built-in cable, an additional USB cable is provided, which is useful for connecting a second device or a phone in thick cases.<br /><br />The power pack supplies 1900mA of charging current to the Galaxy S4 as shown by \\"Battery Charging Source and Current\\" app. This is the case with both the built-in cable as well as the accessory cable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Built-in cable + quality accessory cable<br />2. Large capacity battery<br />2. Compact size<br />3. Charge indicator LED<br />5. Great customer service (my Slim3 is replacement unit the for Slim2. The Slim3 was promptly sent by Anker when the Slim2 died after 4 months)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The housing for the USB plug could be slimmer so the cable can attach firmly through thicker cases. It doesn't cause any issue with mine but I imagine the stubby plug might be an issue with thicker cases. But, rest assured, there is the included short and easy-to-pack accessory USB cable that does come with a slim plug.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging puzzles. Bring on more levels! I finished these fairly quickly because it is so addictive. Would definitely recommend giving it a try.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is my 3rd Anker product purchase from Amazon, and with myriads of Android devices in the household (more than a dozen, yes, that's excessive!), I can attest that this car charger is what you want plugged in your 12v outlet.<br /><br />I measured the current flowing into my Android device with \\"Battery Charging Source and Current\\" app. There are other apps that would do the same, but some devices might NOT be capable to report any charging current, so your mileage may vary. My Galaxy S4 and a few other Android devices do. Other reviewers with workbench 12v outlet would be able to do more accurate reading, but for my purpose, the app suffices.<br /><br />With a good cable, a single Galaxy S4 can pull 1960 mA (~2A) from either port. Again, CABLE MATTERS. If you read reviews that say that they're not getting high current, chances are they are using sub-standard cable. It's trial and error with cables, unfortunately. Good, shorter cable (6 inch to 1ft) would most likely be able to deliver high current, but it depends on the quality. Longer cable can deliver high current if it's shielded. The 6ft cables that come with the later Galaxy and Nexus devices are good cables.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) High amperage supplied power to the device (with good cable)<br />2) Not too bulky<br />3) Good price<br />4) Anker has a great customer service from my own personal experience<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Label is so tiny (doesn't matter for me cause all of my devices are Android)<br />2) Long form factor. In my VWs, the 12v outlet is hidden and recessed horizontally (top-down) in the center console, so this isn't a problem, but in other cars where the outlet is vertical, it might stick out a bit too far.
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|I'm a big fan of Bruno Mars, but this CD was disappointing. I'll be posting it online to sell it soon.  :(
B007TKT2SK|3.0|This application is off to a solid start. It does fractions (alone) pretty well, but as mentioned previously, it does not have a decimal and lacks memory (history). Pretty sad for a &quot;Paid App&quot;. Hopefully the developer will continue to improve what they've started.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game... great sense of accomplishment after solving a room. fun for my daughter and myself. can't wait for new levels.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It says FREE BUT ITS NOT... could be a fun game but constantly asks if you want to connect to FB or contact friends and you have to pay money to go to the next level. I don't like all the annoying messages popping up. There's plenty of other fun games that are FREE and don't invade your privacy with their permissions.
B00DYCFKSI|5.0|Great album! Not a bad song on it. (Dream Theater fan since Images and Words) A superior follow-up to the mediocre 'A Dramatic Turn of Events'.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It took a lot of chapters before finding out what the secret was.  I was shocked!  It was worth the wait.
0920668372|5.0|I first read this book while browsing in a book store several years ago. I was in tears at the end and defy any adult who reads the book to have dry eyes when they are done. This book embodies the unconditional love we give our children and receive from our parents. It's a love that transcends time and the reversal of roles when we become caregivers for our parents.

B00FAOGKR8|5.0|I was worried about protecting my new iPhone 5s because my typical 'go to' brands did not have cases available when I went searching. Then I found this pouch with the elastic pull. It works great. The phone stays covered, the connections at the bottom for charging and headphones are accessible, the pull tab makes it easy to get the phone out, and it's a very cute color!! The only thing I had an issue with was that the title said 'leather'. It's not 'leather'. It's what has been called 'PU Leather' or 'faux leather'. The title should be changed to be correct.
B00F880BWG|5.0|AMC does a FABULOUS JOB with all their seasons, but this one has been NON stop intensity and anticipation!! Thank you AMC!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dive through suburban streets and rush through china towns. Subway surfers gives you an advantage to tour the streets at super high speeds. Run from the police, or get caught and start a new game. (Recommended for you)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG finally I've been checking everyday for so long I'm so excited so happy. Thank u. Thank u. Thanks Amazon I hated having my kindle fire and not being able to play this game on my device. I had to use my husband IPad2  when we went places but not anymore. Thank you again hahaha excited.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|This game is fun for the first few minutes. After a while it gets tedious and the stages are so hard that it gets frustrating.
B00DNV9V1W|5.0|This is a very handy screen protector for the phone. It perfectly protects my phone and I am very pleased that bought this protector. This is worth its money. It's OK.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent<br />Excellent<br />Excellent<br />Can you tell I liked it...a lot. Could not put it down. Didn't want it to end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like I said I love Candy Crush Saga ( CCS) so much so it's much fun and I'm waaaaaayyy ahead of my son....and he hates it!!!!
B001BANK32|5.0|One of King's finest and I've nearly read them all!! His writing has always given a good read, but this gives a great read.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I love Mumford and sons.  Their music is great and I love all the instruments and the harmonies, and their enthusiasm.
B00079ZACM|5.0|I saw this movie when it was new. It was wonderful to see it again, fresh and bright. The dvd is excellent and in marvelous condition.<br />It arrived sooner than I expected. Many thanks.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|The music in this album is great, even though the story is sad and even controversial.  I've always loved Eddie's voice and the passion he puts into his music.
B009OCR1X4|4.0|Like many soundtracks, there is some beautiful music and some music that is just filler to support the action or mood of a scene. All in all, though, there is enough beautiful music here to satisfy me.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|One of my favorite bands and always very entertaining.  It's music you want to sing and dance to, or just sit and listen to to put you in a good mood!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This was a very ambitious movie, weaving together scenes over a wide span of time. It was interesting to see the same actors in many different roles. I know that this movie had a difficult time being made, because it's not the typical Hollywood fare. Well worth seeing.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The movie was great, we enjoyed it very much. it's family friendly and reminds of being little.  the book was better, though
B00181JGI2|5.0|Scientific studies have revealed that the secret of true happiness is to see several Coen Brothers movies each year.<br />The Lebowski counts as two!
1932100660|5.0|Every once in a while you read a book that rocks your current view of the world, and at the same time has the potential to forever change your life.  For me, China Study is one of those books. Not many non-fiction books are page-turners, but I found myself glued to the book and constantly wanting to find out more.<br /><br />In sum, Dr. Campbell advocates a whole foods, plant-based diet.  No meat, dairy, or eggs whatsoever.  The reasons are numerous, but have much to do with keeping casein (an animal protein) and dietary cholesterol out of your body.  I was fascinated reading the results of the numerous studies showing the harm that animal protein does to the body.  The book is called \\"China Study\\", but that study is one of hundreds of studies showing the harms of animal-based foods.  Indeed, only one chapter is dedicated to the \\"China Study\\".<br /><br />The last part of the book shows how government, industry, and the scientific community have faltered to the point that we now have a culture in which animal-based food is actually considered normal and healthy.  No conspiracy theories here.  Just an illustration, by an insider, of how the constant desire for money by the dairy and meat industry has kept them fighting against anything that could show that their \\"cash cows\\", so to speak, are making us sick.<br /><br />Before reading the book, I was a vegetarian, but largely a junk food vegetarian.  Most of my life, though, I ate meat.  After reading this book, I have gone full-fledged vegan.  There is no reason to put the poison of animal-based foods in my body anymore.  Indeed, eating animal-based foods is nothing short of a of slow, plaque and cancer-ridden suicide.<br /><br />One question I would love to see answered by this, or another, author is the evolutionary explanation for why animal-based foods are bad.  Many opponents of a plant-based diet will point to the fact that our ancestors ate meat.  Indeed, there are diets, such as the Paleo diet, that try to mimic the way our ancestors ate, and the Paleo diet includes meat consumption.  The only answer I can hypothesize right now is that evolution doesn't care how LONG we live, only whether we can reproduce.  So meat may have actually served it's primary function by allowing a human to live long enough to reproduce, but at the same time doing harm to that human so that he won't live much past his reproductive years.  Anyway, would love to see some research in this area.
B001223BLU|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased this album.  It has all of the best feel-good hits that I love and was a great way for me to change up my current music situation.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Way too much swearing. And that, by little kids (and of course, others). I would not recommend this movie .
B00005YW4H|5.0|i only wish she and ray charles could have done an album together...what a combination that would have been! nora jones is and will always be truly amazing!!!
0812993292|2.0|I liked the first chapter, slogged through the middle and like the last. There are a few spots that were excellent but I found it a tedious trek to get through the rest of it to find them.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|probably like asking a kid if he likes candy! who could not love her style? definitely the most satisfying blend of jazz/blues/country out there and impossible to fault any tune on the album.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Kept thinking that the book was going to improve, but I finally gave up.  Previous reviews were accurate and i should have listened. I sure hope they do not make this into a movie.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This cd is not easy to find - there are alot of tribute albums to Garth Brooks but I needed the real thing for my recent wedding on Cape Cod where our first dance was to be to &#34;To Make You Feel My Love&#34; beautiful sung by Mr. Brooks.  Although shipping took a bit of time, it was well worth it.  The CD set also has a DVD and I cant wait to watch it with my new husband!  You wont be disappointed with this collection - he is a true artist with a beautiful voice.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I would say he is my second favorite Doctor - followed by Tom Baker. and Rose is one of my favorite companions.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I will begin by addressing a couple things, first, Layne Staley was one of a kind. He was powerful, and the way he harmonized with Jerry Cantrell back in the day was just something else to behold. I was saddened to hear of his passing, but he did it to himself with the bad choices he made in life. He is definitely missed, and I pray his soul is at peace.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise though, when I found out that Alice in Chains was reuniting with a new lead singer; a gentleman named William DuVall. At first, upon looking at pictures of him, I wondered if he'd be able to fill in the void that was left when Staley died. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when given the chance to check out an AiC song featuring him called \\"Check My Brain\\", to say I was blown away would be an understatement. DuVall already began showing he had the chops to fill in some big shoes. Though Black Gives Way to Blue was a solid album, I admit, I expected this to be a one-off appearance.<br /><br />Fast forward some time later, and I found out that another album featuring DuVall as co-frontman was released. How this slipped under my radar is beyond me, but irregardless, I had to go check out some songs from it. Checked out \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Stone\\", both were awesome, ended up previewing the entire album on YouTube and I was hooked. For me, every track on The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is excellent. The lyrics are powerful, thoughtful, and actually have a ton of meaning behind them once you get down and think about it. They're the type of lyrics that you actually have to dig beyond the surface to get at the true meaning, but when you do, it all makes sense.<br /><br />DuVall's presence in this band has evolved, while he's still playing co-pilot to Cantrell, he does have more of a presence here than he did in Black Gives Way to Blue. It is amazing though, how eerily like Staley he sounds. Listen to \\"Hollow\\" and tell me that doesn't sound like classic AiC, the same goes with \\"Stone\\", both could've been written in AiC's Dirt or Jar of Flies days, keeping that sludge-rock sound they have had for so long completely in tact, though if you ask me \\"Voices\\" is another highlight mainly because of how catchy the hook and chorus are. They showcase how Cantrell and DuVall get on well as a harmonic duo. Another standout and pleasant surprise was the song \\"Hung on a Hook\\", DuVall takes the position of lead vocalist for this song, and the results just blew me away. This proved right here that DuVall has what it takes to be a lead vocalist. I actually hope for AiC's next album, he has even more of a presence.<br /><br />Still, as is, this album is nothing short of awesome. In a sea full of garbage music, it's refreshing to hear that AiC still has it, and is still putting out thoughtful rock for us all to enjoy. I truly hope DuVall stays for a long time, he has an awesome voice, can harmonize very well with Cantrell, and is just amazing both in studio and live. In short, if you're an AiC fan, give this album a listen. You won't be disappointed.
0062059963|4.0|Tris book is good. America faces new problems and she starts to question Maxon and her future with him. Of you lijes the first one and liked it you should read this one. They might be sometimes when you want to throw the book but you wont regret reading it! ;)
B003G4W49C|5.0|&#34;You haven't read Ender's Game?&#34; My Wife couldn't believe it. Of all the classic Sci-fi books on the market it can be hard to sort through the list. Luckily my wife reads everything so when we saw that this was going to be a major motion picture she said, &#34;It is about time!&#34;<br /><br />It turns out she was right, this story is brilliant. Ender Wiggins is a kid born, bred and crafted into becoming a military genius for the sake of saving the human race from an alien invasion. Despite its enormous scale, this story is very personal. The writing is dialogue heavy and expresses masculine ambitions both dark and honorable. More important than the easily believable characters is the heart of the tale, a deliberate philosophy of realism which permeates every difficult challenge both physical and emotional. The lessons are those meant to train warriors, the outcome is one meant to elevate humanity.<br /><br />I can see why they waited so long to make this into a film. The current technology can more accurately produce the actions and vision of this epic story. My only apprehension is to wonder, what will the studios leave out of the film? That will determine if Ender can be as great on screen as it is on the written page.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I've only played through a few of levels so far, but it's a very fun and engaging game. The puzzles start out easy and passing each stage is easy, but trying to get all the items on that stage starts to become harder as you progress. think of this game as a much more intuitive Waldo.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|great to have this bag to carry most of the time to protect the good camera we got, its awesome
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Finally a movie with a story line that can be understood whithin a realistic possibility.  What makes this movie great is that you can follow it as if it is unfolding in real life.  Human trafficing is a real and present danger, and a father's love for his daughter can be understood by any loving father today.  Liam Nesson fulfills his role brilliantly.  Highly recommended!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I can play on my kindle!! I love this game! Best app ever!  Now  I cam play on the go! Thank you amazon!
B004IWR06S|4.0|I did not give this move 5 stars simply because it was too long and very very sad...<br /><br />Other than that, the movie is a beautiful story that surrounds death...You can kind of predict that they three people meet in the end because the movie jumps from person to person...<br /><br />The twin Marcus had me super sad :(... overall good movie...have a box of tissues ready.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This movie was truly amazing.  I grew up playing RPGs like Robotech and Rifts and this film brought my childhood imagination to life.  It felt like Robotech meets Godzilla on an epic scale.  I would definitely recommend this to any sci-fi fan.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Every year there are fewer TV programs that are worth the time it takes to watch them.  Writing that respects your intelligence, characters you want to be able to relate to and good actors blend together to earn an audience.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Movie is no good- it follows the modern day visual stimulation over actual content of movies.  I don't advise renting/buying.
B004J4WNL2|1.0|Cain salivates over &#34;introvert&#34; Al Gore in her book.  I wonder if her publishers want to issue a new edition now that we know Gore pushed &#34;man-made global warming&#34; so he could make money in the carbon credit game. So, here's the takeaway for the introvert folks: just push an idea based on phony statistics while playing to people's fears and you can become rich and famous!  And when you find yourself losing your argument based on facts, simply sell your failing cable channel to Al-Jazeera and label your opponents as &#34;racists.&#34; Seriously, Susan Cain, is this someone we should emulate? There have to be better examples than Al Gore.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|not difficult but entertaining.  I enjoy this game early in the morning while I am waiting for others to wake up.
B00C7EGV5U|5.0|Very informative - I had no idea about the history of Nigeria and Biafra read it as a follow up to Half of a Yellow Sun explained where the Igbo people's culture comes from - they were good people but misunderstoopd by the colonialists - how common that has been over time !
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I liked this one better then the other two.<br />So glad that I bought it. Family really enjoy it.<br />I think that sums it up, but yet I still have to write more.
B009YBU8CQ|5.0|Beautifully written account of a very confronting subject I also enjoyed Half of a Yellow Sun immensely had no idea about the history of Biafra
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|I really like this but don't get up with out pausing it or you will miss something. Cant wait to watch it again. Interesting story line told.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is excellent, I just started watching. The show is based on scientific principals that are plausible and how they could possibly happen. Great writing and production, the special effects are great. I am a fan now and will watch the other seasons.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|This movie was better then I thought it would be since the reviews said don't waste you money to see it on the big screen wait for the DVD.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Super fun and challenging game. Love the added obstacles and challenges. Very addicting and fun game. Bring on the next challenge.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great.  Easy set up.  Limited services so far (Netflix, Google, Youtube), but more will be added.  This technology is advancing quickly and in case it needs to be upgraded, the low cost limits the risk.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who doesn't love pinterest? The app works beautifully.  No real complaints here.  Sometimes it's a little hard for me to get back to where I want to be but I think that's user error.
1603427244|5.0|Wow!  Who knew?  I have not tried any new ways to cast on or bind off as of yet, however, just the thought that there is so many other ways that might work better depending on the type of project was mind blowing.  Have added it to my library for later use.  Just not enough time to try new things at this time but will soon!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|My only complaint is that I don't particularly like the layout but it works exactly the way it's supposed to!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is one of the best app i got i really like  because i get to create whatever i want
0385341008|5.0|Cute book my book club had and we all enjoyed it.  Looking forward to other books by the same author.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|This book was confusing because it skipped around - hard to keep my train of thought from one chapter to the next.  In the end it all made sense, but it was drudgery to keep reading.  The book was depressing because, even though I was vaguely aware that animal testing of all kinds has gone on, I could not believe that parents would subject their own children to living with and growing up with animals.
B00633W614|4.0|I have enjoyed the storyline of this book and the history it depicts of WWII. I look forward to reading the 3rd in the series.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I always expect to get what I pay for, and indeed, I was thrilled throughout this movie. I am a huge Guillermo del Toro fan and so far, he never fails to amaze me with his directing and writing. It's not just a breathtaking movie, the acting is also excellent, and the special effects are marvelous.  There are twists to the plot and I laughed in more than one scene. Highly recommended for us thrill seekers.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|She is more relatable than I thought.  Authentic.  Humble.  My favorite is ch. 2 about confidence and gender.  I have re-read that chapter more than once.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie with fun script.  Love the dynamic and interaction.  Action was super! It was a must have to own!
0679809015|5.0|My 1.5 year loves loves this book.....<br />She cant wait to &#34;open&#34; the hidden chambers.<br />Fun book to read! Happy to own it
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this series and would watch them over and over! Can't wait to get the next ones coming out, like Season 4!!  I hope they go on and on!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't play everyday but when I get started I can't stop! It's addicting great game. So glad Kindle finally got candy crush.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to finally have it on Kindle. Happy happy HAPPY. So addicted to this game it is a crying shame.
B004GFN11A|1.0|This was a 5 stars app until some genius took out the link to the Dashboard. Now there is no way to access plugins or theme options using a cellphone or tablet.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game.  So glad it finally came to Kindle Fire.  I am playing it every day and never have had a problem.  King also has Gems Journey which is another good one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is the best ever! It's relaxing and entertaining at the same time. The challenge makes you want to play over and over again.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|Despite sketchy dialogue, the suspense is addictive.  The conspiracies within Carrie's &#34;workplace&#34; heighten her and Sol's precarious places with in the organization, and bring to mind the words of Thomas Moore : nothing is lost on him who sees.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this book after I had already watched the series on netflix.  While they do differ quite a bit, I love them both equally. The show is definitely more dramatized than the book. But the book gives you a great and personal incite to one woman's trip to prison.  Most people have a stereotypical view as town at prison is like, I was certainly one of them. But this book shows a treated side to that situation. It goes into various relationships between inmates. I truly enjoyed it.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Gorgeous, virtuosic instrumentals, relaxed and full delivery from Leonard Cohen and vocalists.  When I want the full package and a boost to the spirit, I play this album.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|This has been a family favorite for years and always elicits much applause and laughter.  Chevy Chase has never been my favorite actor but in this role I find him hilarious.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I heard there was an update, for this app but there wasn't. I wanted to make the girls dance. :( :(.  But  it's still a good app. My Little sister loves it.
0385523394|4.0|Not done yet but so far a great read!<br />A birds eye view of the life of prisoners. Freedom is a gift!
B000YABYLA|4.0|After watching Juno, the comedy and drama movie of 2002 which took place during Juno MacGuffs or Ellen Page Junior year in high school. Her best friend Paulie Bleaker or Michael Cera had gotten Juno pregnant and they couldn't raise it on their own. After contemplating abortion, Juno decided to go with a closed adoption, where she would give the child to a family. After meeting Mark and Vanessa Loring, or Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, she decides to give the child to them. Mark started to like Juno and wanted to leave Vanessa. Juno still gave birth to the child and gave it to Vanessa while Paulie and Juno started dating.<br /><br />  If I were to pick an audience that this appealed to it would be pregnant teens. This movie showed me that there are much more alternatives to just aborting the baby and the fears of abortion. This also gives the audience some sort of insight on what they would be going through if they were pregnant which I had liked. I also like that the movie shows people that through determination anything is possible and things could end up going well in the end.<br /><br />  Some things that I didn't like all that much was the strange plot twist. I mean that when the scene of Mark trying to get with Juno and how he was going to leave Vanessa. Some things that I also didn't like is the acting. It was almost as if they forced everything to happen. It wasn'tvery natural, like it as automated. If a friend asked me if I would recommend the movie to them it would depend. If they were pregnant then I would recommend it to them. If they weren't then I wouldn't, just because it doesn't grab me as an audience.<br /><br />  In conclusion, to a general audience I wouldn't recommend this movie. But if you really wanted to go see it for yourself you could find it in the movie store, on TV, or on Netflix.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. It is so addictive, I don't know what I would do without this game. It will never get old to me. I just wish I could pass level 133 though but other than that. It's great!!!!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Awesome game!! A great game to play while waiting for kids or an appointment. I like the graphics. I have had no issues since I downloaded it to my Kindle.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I love the way the director used silence and natural sounds instead of a loud, obnoxious soundtrack. It created a very atmospheric feel to the movie. That being said, I was disappointed that there was no mention of the mayor or his daughter. They play a very important role in the second and third book.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I am reading the reacher books in order.  I really liked the book.  Great action, good suspense. A great read.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I like Science Fiction for entertainment but this one kind of scared me a little bit.  Cannot see the international news about strange virus's like SARS, new flu's, and hemorrhagic fevers without the connection here.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I really do love this version of Sherlock. Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job with the role. He's a fantastic actor. Just wish there were more episodes per season. That would make these perftect. The episodes are 1.5 hours, though, so that makes up for it a bit. The stories are classic, the acting is wonderful.
B000NY17J6|5.0|I rushed to buy this after hearing her on the radio talking about her Parkinson's.  she won't be singing anymore so I will be buying all of  her old albums.
B0081336FO|5.0|I loved season one. Season two has even more episodes and classic material. The acting duo is marvelous. Love they way the interact.
B00847KFDS|5.0|As a long time John Fogerty fan, I couldn't help but love this CD.  I listen in my car and at work.
B00CIVLZ3U|2.0|I keep hoping the authors books won't be obvious and cliched - still no luck. If you are interested in a so-so written adolescent boy fantasy with all the obvious tropes and cliches then this is for you. If you are after a book which is well written, inventive, not obvious nor sexist then look elsewhere, maybe Railsea by China Mieville?
B005LAIIN0|5.0|World war Z is a interesting take on the Zombie genre, It has your typical elements that you see in every Zombie Flick out there, I.E. (Mass hysteria, Zombies Chasing and Biting people turning them into Zombies etc etc.) But whats not so typical about this film is the different stories and undertones you might get, I.E. (The U.N. Being Directly involved, even how things might be different in other countries.) Over all this film is (I.M.O.) fun to watch I am not a Brad Pitt Fan but the story dose not focus just on his role but focuses on the different stories and a bit on the undertones.<br /><br />The story is fantastic and perhaps not so typical, the entertainment value I.M.O. is one that I watch this film and will watch this film again and again.<br /><br />If your a Zombie fan and/or a Zombie movie fan watch this movie at least once you wont be disappointed.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|Watched it in 3d on the home theater. Based on the reviews I was expecting more; the plot was just too predictable. With a well-rated title you expect to find moments and scenes of excellence, where the whole thing just comes together. Didn't find any here. First class effects. Surprisingly weak score from a great composer. Ham-handed character development; can't help but think that way too much was left on the editing room floor.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This app really let's me express myself in a way that let's me think very creatively. My favorite thing to do in this game is to breed the dragons and see which one I get. One time I got a Sun dragon before the updates were implemented. So in a small sum of words this app is fun and let's you be creative.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|This isn't &#34;A&#34; giant robot movie, it's &#34;THE&#34; giant robot movie. Yes, the plot is sorta dopey, and yes the character development is minimal. The acting is good enough. I think your enjoyment of this film is going to be directly proportional to the capabilities of the system you watch it on. You need to be able to get folded into the action and shaken by the booms. Watching this on a small screen is a pointless exercise in squinty darkness, I suspect.<br /><br />A reasonable number of &#34;oh wow&#34; visual moments keep the excitement level up. The plot falls off at the end, of course, and the multi-bot-monsta battles can be a bit hard to follow.
B00A2H9X6I|3.0|Steven King's first published novel was \\"Carrie\\" in 1974 and then two-years later in 1976, the film came. \\"Carrie\\" starred a relative newcomer at the age of 27 named Sissy Spacek. Spacek brought the character to life and had one of the most iconic film scenes of all time. That one scene caused young girls for ages to always look over their heads at the prom.<br /><br />The new version of \\"Carrie\\" stars Chloe Grace Moretz, who is not a newcomer, has been part of almost 30 films to date and is only 16. Moretz is a perfect casting choice for a film that was trying to emulate the original. She is the right age for an awkward high school girl with no friends and she even somewhat looks like a young Sissy Spacek. Moretz, who has been acting since she was 8, proves that she is a fine actress, effortlessly moving from shy teenage recluse to shy teenage recluse with a glimmer of hope, but at times her postures are extremely annoying and over-exaggerated; a tilted head here and a twisted shoulder there; product of pre-effect acting.<br /><br />Both movies, 1976 & 2013, delve into the life of a girl who is held prisoner by a religious fanatic mother and therefore has no social abilities. Although where her social abilities are virtually non-existent, she finds that she has unlimited ability of telekinesis. This is the nuts and bolts of both movies, but the problem is, the stuff in between is also pretty much the same in both movies.<br /><br />The new version didn't explore any new venues. After viewing the new version, I can only guess that they just wanted to retell the story to a culture of people who are more acutely aware of school bullying and spruce up the special effects when they come about. The movie plays like an old-style film experience, not overtly focusing on special effects and events and giving us a rich amount of personality, which I like, but if you're gonna make the exact same movie, you sure better make it better than the original. It wasn't.<br /><br />\\"Carrie\\" 2013 isn't a bad film and I'm sure for those who haven't seen the original film it may even be a good film. From somebody who has seen the original though, it was a waste of time and effort. To make matters worse, the effects that were done in 1976 may have been from the 20th century and before HD, pixels and green screen effects, but at least the effects looked real. The effects in the new version did nothing to approve upon the original and most of the time, you can tell that Moretz is acting before the layers of effects are placed. Not to mention, many of the effects went over the top and left us with the impression that Carrie was more X-Men than high school girl with strong telekinesis.arrie\\" 2013 isn't a bad film and I'm sure for those who haven't seen the original film it may even be a good film.

0061547840|4.0|I consider Donald's book a &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; business book like I consider Starship Troopers a guilty pleasure movie. If I want to learn more about business I will read Peter Drucker. Trump is an over the top egomaniac and I don't worry about pre-nups at my income level and I'm not worried about getting revenge on my enemies. Do most people have &#34;enemies?&#34;<br /><br />What I do takes away from this book are two things. The first is you do need to think big, which is not a new idea but a good reminder. The second is that if you don't promote yourself, who will? Yes he will tell you how great he is, etc, etc but he is constantly promoting himself and people will pay a premium to live in one of his buildings, or buy his books or they're willing to watch &#34;The Apprentice&#34; for 13 seasons.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Rihanna is a one of a kind artist.  She has a unique voice.  I gave this a 5 star rating because this is her best album.  I say this because this is the only cd I like by her.  In fact, I never thought I would buy an album by her.  This cd is great. preview it and buy it if you like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love It. but very Addictive But its A Really Cool.Game To Play.  I really like it exp if your board this will keep u busy
B004H2ZFPW|5.0|She is a great artist and song writer.  Anything she puts out is a hit.  Buy this if you like her music.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Great App, fast and fun! Like the different options for backgrounds and card deck. Very easy to use and navigate around.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|this is eminem rap group.  they are unique.  i say this because they're not that many rap groups that combine humor and serious matter into they're raps.  Not every song is great, but is still good.  I hope they come out with a new one.  If you like eminem rap style, you will like his group.
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|Great buy, great seller!  Movie was as remembered, excellant Blu-Ray quality, but also love that I have a copy to play on a traditional dvd player!
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|A lot of Robin Williams films are great.  This film is about a board game that comes to life.  Trust me, buy this if you want to see an adventure that you will want to watch over and over.
0099579936|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book.....glad I could get it at a good price thru Amazon.  I absolutely loved this book.  Very believable and don't think the movie could portray it as well.  Definitely a book to read!!!!!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This is a great documentary whether you are a fan of Metallica or not.  You may love documentaries by itself as a whole.  First of all let me start off by saying learning about a bands history is one of my favorite things to read or watch about.  It doesn't even have to be an artist.  It could be an actor or someone in sports entertainment.  This documentary talks about how they got started, who was originally in the band, and why they are still successful to this day.  There is nothing that I don't like about this film. Only thing I can say about this film is if you want it, buy it.  If not, don't buy it. Plain and simple.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun game to pass the time have to think and it is great when you can beat your kids scores.
0061537969|5.0|Okay, I cried after the first 7 pages, I think it is an excellent book at times the racing is to much but the story line is excellent, Yes I cried at the end when Enzo I believe came back as a boy...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great fun game!  I have been playing for a while now and it never gets boring.<br />It is addicting and at times frustrating.  I love playing it.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|Love this, It's roughly based on historical facts, We all know there are many versions of history, the witchcraft in the series is \\"television\\". They take some true facts, some speculations, whatever and make a very interesting and fun series to watch. People need to lighten up, for television......I loved it! Great acting too!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|And I really like the movies.  Great stories.  Great acting.  They make you like Hannibal until he does something horrible.  Then yon like him again.
B009HEMF1M|4.0|Targeting  baby boomers. We enjoyed this film. The casting  could not have  been better. It is a film for desert dwellers, or a cold snowy day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just loaded this game and learning to love it.  I can see why so many people are getting into playing this game
0062213423|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my eleven year old granddaughter and was an instant hit.  She loved the pictures and the information about One Direction.  The book was colorful and very well done.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|I enjoyed the main characters for their strengths and flaws.  I felt it was a fairly predictable read, but enjoyed every word non the less.  Will definitely read another book with this detective duo.  I can see the stories and plots will continue to evolve.
B001E5FYS8|3.0|The man and the feat itself are spectacular. This dvd suffers from want of a good editor. For me, too long for the content.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. everything about it . it kept me reading. it was definitely addictive. the ending literally made me cry. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. &#60;3
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. I can play for hours; I look forward to play this game. It is a great way to challenge my mind and to escape from the stress of my day.
0143122916|5.0|A friend recommended I read this book, and I am very pleased he did. This book is an exceptional record of what is going on in North Korea today -- the story of a young man who is in prison for crime he didn't commit in a prison nation. It's amazing he survived, let alone escaped. This is the most moving book I have read.  Buy it. Read it.
B005BY3XHC|4.0|I am really learned some spiritual knowledge from this book .as a entrepreneur this book helped me to my success .
B009MB682W|5.0|This is a great collection of original Bond tunes with everything except Skyfall. I love it! I used to own an album with all of the same songs, only it ended with Octopussy (since it was early '80's). Good sound quality.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had seen this out for awhile before deciding to get one, and when I did, it was gone, everywhere. So on back order, and then it came in. Great for streaming You tube videos to my TV. Portability factor is 10, Apps, need more than just 6, albeit it is a new device, and development is slow. But it is worth the 35 bucks to wait.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I admit I haven't finished reading Hosseini's third novel.  Why?  I haven't been able to follow the plot because it is not linear.<br />I will get the print copy and begin again, because the writing is excellent, evocative, and intriguing.  I hope this helps other Kindle readers.  Sometimes ebooks are not the best choice for a novel
0141394811|5.0|I found this book to be quite entertaining. I was happy to have some insight into the childhood of Moz. I blazed through this book in a day and wish I had taken my time. This will be a classic so it is a good thing it is released as such!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun.  Can't wait for more levels! Makes you think, but not too hard.Im sure as more levels are created the difficulty will increase. I'm looking forward to it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting and waiting for this to become available on the Kindle and it finally is! Much better than playing it on my smartphone! Thank you!
B001CDWFPC|4.0|Does not fully integrate with the original Kindle Fire so turns out to be less than I expected important translation.
1401917232|1.0|The tittle I found implied how the book might address the feeling that many people (granted that in reality there aren't many people out there)  have of being forgotten by love. However, I did not find the book addressed this. For the most part it addressed it only in how it had not forgotten him<br /><br />Hence, i found this book an underwhelming read hardly worth the wait. It was not close to the impressive and groundbreaking material found in his first book which i did find did  an amazing job in introducing the course in miracles.<br /><br />I was hoping this third book might have helped me (and perhaps others like me) who experience a course in miracles fatigue. I personally did not find it to be very helpful.<br /><br />Gary's lessons seem, to an outsider viewer, as minuscule compared to what other people deal with; granted it is stated that there are no levels of difficulty. However, it seems that a paradox is at work since i do believe Gary's teacher have told him he will have a  \\"big\\" forgiveness lesson in his  last lifetime.<br /><br />Even though repetition is key to learning in this book the course material felt parroted; still this book is worth a read and I encourage the author to continue writing perhaps with less fluff the next time.<br /><br />May this words serve as objective criticism, if not, surely they will serve as forgiveness lesson to whomever reads them and is offended by them. (only the ego can be offended.)<br /><br />ps.  forgiveness is the answer... and God is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting forever for CC to come to Kindle!!<br />Love it!  Best game ever...the other games pale in comparison!<br />Love the bigger screen....a great game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love brain games. This game makes you think things through before you can escape. Nothings as easy as it seems
B006M4RN3U|3.0|I have come to realize the day of the &#34;hair bands&#34; (eighties and early nighties) is gone.  Not bad on a few of the songs; however, they are no Metallica Van Halen or Meat Loaf.  Now I know why my parents just could not get into what I listened to.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|From the start to the end this movie has me interested and I find it wowing how it all connected in the end. Truly a masterpiece for fiction movies.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This is an old love.  I will never let it go, but it's too painful to think about too often.<br />  A few years ago, we were going through a drought worse than the thirties, but here was no dust bowl, no crop failures, no bank failures, no population upheaval and migration.  Back then, my mother had lost her savings, and been unable to go to a state university 13 miles down the highway.<br />  All the changes between the thirties and now have been liberal political causes, and Steinbeck was accused of being a Communist.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I see the movie portraying that love can bring anyone back to life even a zombie. Sometimes we just forget how powerful love really is or can be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just as addictive as the Facebook edition. Easy to use, fast, great graphics, well worth paying. Especially for free. Only down fall is that some of your friends on Facebook that play so not show up on this version for and reason.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|The cast the writing the acting it is all outstanding! I find it clever how it was all... oh I won't ruin it for you. Just watch it; it's definitely worth it.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Love it! Only EWF can make you dance, think, meditate and love with their music.<br />You will not be disappointed with this CD
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I was a little skeptical about watching or even purchasing this movie. But I'm glad to say that I did. It was better written then the first one. Once they put Bruce Willis in well then you can expect a good movie. Bottom line over all a good movie with a good twist of why storm shadow joined the dark side.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I have already recommended this book to several family members in their 30's as I think it is really good information to arm yourself with as you enter the workforce.  It helps you to identify characteristics in the workforce so that you are not only aware of their existence but can manage how you personally choose to address them.  This is critical as a women who is thinking of having children - her perspective is dead on.  She is not telling you what to choose - she is just giving you different ways to think about the choices. I believe that I would be further in my career and even would have managed my career choices after having a child (later in life) better with this insight.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|It beautifully reflects how a man is cable of loving his soul mate and walking the walk of his vows to his wife.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|This is a compilation of steamy poems that are sure to make you explode with sticky goodness. Usually I do not read poetry, because my mind just does not go that deep when it comes to interpreting the art of others; but, this book hit all the right spots.<br /><br />If you want a book of poetry that has the perfect mix of sweets and treats, then this is the book for you. Just make sure you bring a napkin for the clean-up...it might get a little messy.
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you like techno,dub step, electric, hip hop kind of music definitely give this a try. Lindsey plays her violin over the type of music that I've listed at the beginning.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 of Fifty Shades were very good.  Yes, it is explicit but a very good story line also and I couldn't wait to see how it was all going to come out.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I struggled with the rating on this one.<br /><br />This was actually a great idea/concept, but I feel like there are too many things unexplained.<br />I think the character development could've been better. Maybe give us a prologue in the Glade before Thomas and Teresa show up?<br /><br />There was definitely some edge-of-your-seat hold-your-breath moments!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|We went to see them live in Tampa, FL and this is a great CD. Get your Black Sabbath on!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Caveat: I received this book free in exchange for an honest review. Also I did not read the first book in the series.<br /><br />I decided to go ahead and read this even though I hadn't read the first book, I was prepared to step back and read it first if I felt lost in the beginning - but I didn't! There was no confusion and the author didn't reference things from the previous book without recapping - I like that.<br /><br />Now on to the story, there's the ever-dreaded love triangle aspect between Maxon/America/Aspen. Thankfully it wasn't overly angsty and while there is discussion about it - They are basically letting America make her own decision instead of tugging and pulling her back and forth.<br /><br />I do wish there had been more details about 'the outside world', maybe this was outlined in the first book and that's why I'm unsure? It just felt like they could've provided more details about the attacks and the war going on outside the palace.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|It took so long to get.  I should have just got it down the street from walmart or some other place and pay full price for as long as it took.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book was slower than the first, and it seemed like there was less action. Most of it was just running from one place to another with a couple fight scenes mixed in.<br /><br />I love the premise of the book, and where the author seems to be going with it, I can't wait to see what happens in book 3!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Easy to carry and very effective, I was even able to sharpen a machete with this little tool, no more dull blades!!
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|These guys just keep getting better and better.  LLooovvveeeee every single song.  Makes me want to become a groupie and follow them around everywhere.  But I won't.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you were a Shining fan you will want to read this book!  I couldn't wait to get to the next page.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He's baaaaaaaaaaaccccccck! This book is a true page-turner. Loved it. Stephen King writes like he did 20+ years ago. The characters are interesting and the story moves right along. King can make you feel like you are right there in the thick of things. It's nice to see what might have happened to Danny, a boy we loved way back when. To Stephen King I say one word - MORE !!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Another format to learn and confuse an old man. Don't remember exactly what the problems were as I deleted it after use attempt to use it.
1401938906|3.0|This has an extra star for potential in regards to other people's needs...... Based on \\"A Course in Miracles\\", this is a simplified workbook for those who have gotten bogged down in the rhetoric of \\"A Course\\". At the end of each chapter there is a log sheet for your \\"experiment\\" on thought changing reality.<br /><br />The Nine Experiments consist of (in my words):<br /><br />Invisible Energy/Field of Infinite Possibilities;<br />Drawing to You via Beliefs & Expectations;<br />You as Field of Energy; What You Focus You Expand;<br />Connections Provide Unlimited Guidance;<br />Thoughts & Consciousness Matter;<br />Thoughts & Consciousness=Scaffolding for Your Physical Body;<br />Connecting to Everyone & Everything in the Universe;<br />Universe is Unlimited Abundant, & Accommodating.<br /><br />This book is small and for a \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" is cheaply printed... Honestly, the dang paper is so fraking thin you can see not only the printing on the back side of the page you're reading but the page before/after that one as well! THAT IS SO FREAKING ANNOYING, especially for those of us who need glasses to read!
B007HACDLK|3.0|With the exception of a police ambush, there was a minimum of the mayhem characteristic of Flynn's books. There was an overabundance of rapturous description of Rapp's prodigious skills, but it got tedious in the absence of action. In the future, I'd suggest more Rapp and less rapture.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I've just startrd playing this and it's kind of confusing.  I didn't find any rules and don't know what the special candy function is or how to use it.  It seems that each one does something different and I haven't figured that out yet.  Then there is the issue of having to pay to play further, which I'm not about to do.  There a lot of fun free games out.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story and it kept me captivated up to the last page. The characters were so diverse and came to life in the story. Excellent writing style and I enjoyed every twist and turn!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The story is interesting and the light shed on the prison system is needed and relevant, but the philosophical passages feel forced and insincere. The writing isn't the best, either.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it because you change things around and work for goals. The only down fall is I don't have enough&nbsp;time to play.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Keeps you on edge and wanting more.  Characters are well developed.  I couldn't put the book down I had to know what was going to happen next.  The story is full of love, heartache, and the true meaning of family without color.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Its a Ram Mount! That says a lot about the quality. It worked perfectly for my needs and after several months of use it has performed perfectly. I would recommend this product.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very fun and no doubts about it. It will not be waste of money  I promise. Im so glad they have it for amazon appstore. Next they need snapchat.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|This game is genius! I LOVE it! The characters are absolutely hilarious, the &#34;Miami Vice&#34;, 80's themed graphics are stunning and funny as hell! And don't get me started on the banter between the lawyers! Whoever thought this up has a sarcastic and twisted sense of humor that I LOVE! I seriously hope that they can come up with an even funnier part two!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed reading this.  Nothing like I expected. No freaky scare. Just good to know what happened to Danny. Thanks S.K.

B009WUBERW|5.0|I love the fight scenes in this movie. Usually they try to hard to out do the first movie, but I had no complaints about this one.
B00E9E4E50|4.0|Is it legitimate for a serious pianist to make a career based on 60 million YouTube hits?  There's no settled answer. As hungry as the classical music industry might be for new, younger audiences, a good deal of existing prejudice (and ignorance) of new media is bound to enter the story.  The snifish attitude of critics is detectable when the NY Times reviewer of a Lisitsa recital speaks of the Ukrainian-born pianist's \\"savvy reinvention in the way she jump-started her stalled career.\\"  Her quickie recording of Rachmaninov concertos (no rehearsal with the orchestra) received decidedly mixed reviews. But anyone who is familiar with the grueling demands of a solo career, not to mention the heartbreak of numerous talented virtuosos who never make the grade, will emotionally be on her side.<br /><br />It may not bode well that so few Amazon fans have appeared to cheer Lisitsa on with her latest Decca release. It's a confident display of her flying fingers - Lisitsa even had the courage to cut a real-time analog LP without retakes or editing, in addition to the regular 24-bit digital CD. The sound is natural and full; the instrument has an appealing tone with no hard treble, a frequent complaint I have with digital sound.  The rumbling, cavernous bass when she holds down the sustaining pedal, as she likes to do, is commanding.<br /><br />The program is as follows:<br /><br />Liszt:<br />Ballade No. 2 in B minor, S171/R16<br />Aida Di Verdi - Danza Sacra e Duetto Finale S436<br />Rondeau fantastique sur un th&egrave;me espagnol 'El contrabandista' S252 (1836)<br />Hungarian Rhapsody, S244 No. 12 in C sharp minor<br /><br />Schubert-Liszt:<br />Ave Maria, S558 No. 12<br /> Gute Nacht (No. 1 from Winterreise, D911)<br />Das Madchens Klage, D191 (Schiller)<br />Erlk&ouml;nig, D328<br />Der M&uuml;ller und der Bach (No. 19 from Die sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin, D795)<br /><br />Overall, there's no mistaking that Lisitsa is after the big Russian style of Liszt, as exemplified by Gilels and Richter,  more in the sturdy, authoritative vein of the former than the electrifying spontaneity of the latter. NOt that either Gilels or Richter specialized in Liszt to the extent that, say, Grigory Ginzburg, Lazar Berman, and Horowitz did.  Just to invoke those names casts a shadow over this album, because Lisitsa, for all the sweep and rumble of her playing, sounds a bit ordinary where Liszt demands the extraordinary. Among young female pianists who recorded some Liszt in and around his bicentennial, Yuja Wag and Lise de la Salle are likely to be remembered long after Lisitsa. And yet I don't want to join the harumphing purists who resent her from rising through the ranks of YouTube.<br /><br />Sucn enterprise and populist enthusiasm is commendable.  It was a good choice for Lisitsa to hang her hat on the popular tunes in Liszt's opera fantasies and Schubert lieder arrangements.  She enjoys using the kind of wide rubato that old-style opera singers indulged in.  It may verge on the schmaltzy, but by comparison Lang Lang and Yundi sound a bit clinical in the same music.  Lisitsa has an ability to connect through a combination of technique and expression, which is what virtuoso piano playing is all about. Her warm way with the duet from Aida reminds you of actual singers.  Also to the good is the fact that she never bangs or hectors. The only real flaw is that she can be too dreamy and wayward in her phrasing when the warmth turns into a puddle.<br /><br />The PR blurb points out a real rarity, the flashy grandstanding exhibition that Liszt contrived from a Spanish tune, \\"La Contrabandista\\" (a female smuggler sounds like a good metaphor for how Lisitsa sneaked past the border guards of classical music).  I like the way she approaches the wildly overdone piano writing, giving it dignity, a bit of restraint, nice rhythmic bounce, and an air of enjoyment. Those adjectives apply to the whole program. In the end, this album gives so much unalloyed pleasure that snobbery is totally beside the point. through talent and determination, an underdog shows that she can run near the head of the pack.beside the point. through talent and determination, an underdog shows that she can run near the head of the pack.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great game for my kids to play!!! I love that it brings the history with present to zoo life.  Shows the kids the meaning of wildlife and how they live.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game just came out I was exited so addicting !! DON'T FOTGET TO CONNECT TO FACEBOOK IT HELPS A LOT.
B004EF65QA|4.0|I always enjoy BBC performances.  Although it depicted a different time period, it seemed to reflect the current debate between capitalism and socialism which is so timely today.  The acting was superb, and the setting seemed to be an integral part of the story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book this is the best book I read in my life and it was a funny book. I will read it again
0399256385|5.0|My 18 month old loves these &#34;lift the flap&#34; books. We read them several times an evening sometimes. The board books are durable. The flaps get torn occasionally, but we just tape them back on and keep going! I highly recommend. My little one's favorite is &#34;Where's Spot?&#34;
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I won't repeat what many of the other 5-star reviewers have said, only that I agree with everyone who has waxed enthusiastic about the breadth, depth, and scope of this astonishing work. To anyone who has trouble with the idiosyncratic points of view, I would say the following:  First, much said by Cousins is not all that idiosyncratic: he often expresses insights shared by many other critics and film-lovers, but does so in his own compellingly unique forms of expression.  Second, the many insights that can aptly be described as idiosyncratic make the work that much more engaging and surprising, which is its very strength:  Would we really have needed another AFI-like compendium of conventional thinking about movies?<br /><br />The one thing I would add involves the discussion about Cousins' narration.  I admit having had trouble getting engaged in the episodes the first few viewings, not because I disliked his accent, per se, but because I found the brogue hard to get used to - I had trouble focusing on the content because I was paying so much attention to what at first seemed like his vocal peculiarities.  But I soon got used to it, and then something odd happened:  I became rather addicted to the lilting sound of his voice. I began to notice that I enjoyed both his tone and timbre, and that upward lilting at the end of each sentence.  Especially that upward lilting.  Now, after seeing any new episode (I've been watching on TCM, now plan to order the DVDs), his voice is in my head just like the musical score of a memorable movie. In a way, I think that Cousins, wittingly or not, managed to merge narration and musical score in the most singular way. His voice is the music of his own documentary film, and it's quite beautiful, at times haunting, and it intermingles with the content--the images and ideas about film he presents--in such unexpected and at times revelatory ways.  I often can't wait to see and hear the last line of each show, because it always sums up what he's been trying to get across, with one last upward lilt of his inimitable accent. It makes me wonder what those people who reject the film because of the narrator's voice might be resisting. Listen, I was one of them:  I wondered whether I would stick with the whole program because I felt his voice was hard to tolerate; it kept throwing off my attention. Now I wonder if that response is some peculiarly American form of xenophobia.  My suggestion: Try imagining that you could come to love the voice and you just might.
0316548189|5.0|I am a person of very few words  so the book was in very good condition and that is all! Yeah thanks
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This didn't read as smoothly as &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; but overall was a fairly good read.  I will definitley read the 3rd in this series to follow through on the characters.
B00FVS3RZQ|1.0|Progressively worse since Season One. At least the all-around abysmal acting was made less agonizing by the half-way interesting plot lines. Season 2 was a joke with the whole Shane/Lorie/hat-dude triangle, although &#34;Farm-ageddon&#34; was epic. Season three? Can't even remember. And now this dud of a start for season 4? Now I'm done.
0141000198|4.0|I opened this book as a reaction to two things: the movie and a list.  The movie was great fun. The list was a little off.<br /><br />BBC printed a list of the 100 greatest British 20th century fiction novels, and somehow this novel was included.  That is not a surprise if you deliver your perspective away from the trees and see the forest.<br /><br />Written almost too commandingly for the female audience, this book hits the raw nerve of women in her generation who suffer her eccentricities.  And, to make the book more saleable, she has personality characteristics or flaws which are more common than not.  And, if the flaws are delivered to the literary public, the numbers may lean even more toward sympathizing female readers whose day-to-day doldrums are probably equally nuts.<br /><br />And, then  comes the rom-com hero - Mr. Mark Darcy. He is iconoclastic great for being everything  Bridget Jones and her followers deem to be the classic humble and intellectually superior heartthrob.  He gives the male reader a hint of testosterone - but not enough for many.<br /><br />In the end, after reading this cleverly conceived novel, you know the book is good.  But, 100-best of 20th century good? No.<br /><br />And, to add to the success, the directors, writers and others who converted the book to movie should be summoned to the queen for knighthood, as they follow the book to its tiniest detail; and, with great talent, managed to make the movie better than the book. Really.  And, that is something not said too often.<br /><br />So, now we hear a new book is coming. The sequel. And, the newspapers have already made one revelation - Darcy is dead and Jones has children. Whose, we do not know.  But, the scenario is very different after 20 years.<br /><br />As the new books hits store shelves, I will do what I must regretfully say I should have done for the first: wait for the movie.  They'll probably nail it again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm a cheapskate and not one to shovel out REAL CASH for power ups. I like the challenge of trying to get through the levels on my own, and that's not easy! It takes me several tries (lives) and the next thing I know, I'm out of lives and have to wait (insert here whatever time they tell me) before I can try again. That's disappointing...especially after I'm JUST getting to the point where I'm 'almost'  it. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the idea of using the #of moves vs. a timed feature for most of the games. It takes a lot of the pressure off. It would be helpful if the game could give explanations of the &quot;special candy's individual powers&quot; rather than making you figure it out on your own: BUT, hey, it's FREE.  I can't really complain!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a movie that is really designed for 3D.  The effect works perfectly with the cinematography.  It is all about expressing an encompassing environment and not &#34;in your face&#34; cheesy effects like some moves.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|There seems to be a virus connected to temple run 2. While it was working I enjoyed playing it. It's worth downloading if they remove the virus.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The device works well for the specific providers of content. I was disappointed that it would not stream the Amazon movies and if I had realized that I would probably not have made the purchase. Set up was strange but not difficult.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|I'm not sure who is still making money from these ventures, but Nirvana's In Utero Super Deluxe Edition is well worth the investment for the die-hard fan!  I love hearing songs in their early production days as well as live  and remixed (not techno, mind you) versions.  The Super Deluxe Edition also comes with a booklet with several pictures of the band's glory days.  Not only is the music still relevant today, it is also a gem straight out of music history.
B00C7607BC|5.0|The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie when I was 5 and it was just released. Now I have a daughter of my own who is 2 and has already taken an interest in Ariel so when I seen they were releasing it I had to get it. I'm disappointed the dvd only release isn't until December 1st since all of my daughter's Disney movies are on that format. I noticed one of the combos come in dvd packaging and asked my husband to pick that one up for us but he came home with this one. There was no way my daughter was waiting on a return to the store so we kept this one. The movie was just as good as I remember and I think it looks great. I was nervous it would look very dated as some other Disney movies I've seen tend to look even after being \\"remastered'. My daughter enjoyed it and we've watched it several times already. I was disappointed that some of the extras weren't on the dvd disk(the crab-e-oke). I'm guessing they're on the blu-ray disk but haven't checked it out yet. My access to a blu-ray player is my husband's PS3 so we normally just use a dvd player for my daughter. I was able to download the digital copy on itunes and all the extras were on there. I loved that so I still rate it 5 stars for that reason. Now I have access to the movie on my computer and iphone. I always feel like these movies are overpriced but for all the formats I got with this one it was worth it. Will probably purchased these combopacks in the future because of this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this is on kindle now. I have been waiting for this for a long time. I am so excited this is on the kindle now.
B00004CYR8|1.0|I was unable to watch this movie. It was for a different region. I tried it in several machines and would not play.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Once you take the time to look around and figure this app out and how it works, its actually fairly easy to use.  I have had it for at least 4 or more months now.<br /><br />I absolutely love the new interface!  Looks high tech lol!
B001MDXOBQ|5.0|Great album. A true american metal classic for all times. A good high quality electronic copy of the album. Highly recommended.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It's clear to see why this was a Pulitzer winner. This story shows the powers of both lifelong indoctrination  of a people and love.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|The teaming up of Stephen Stills and Kenny Wayne Shepherd seemed strange to me, at first, but after hearing this CD I am a believer!  Stills voice is in commanding form, and Shepherd's voice is stronger than he reveals on his own CDs. The guitar work is awesome, sometimes simple and haunting.  Other times rocking out as KWS is known for.  I am really enjoying this recording, and I hope I get the chance to see them perform live.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the worst drug invented. Candy Crush is so addictiveeeeeee!!!!!! I'm not sure how this game Is legal. They should have rehabs for this.
B008Y212PI|4.0|i like this game and it is a game that my son likes every time we have go some where he asks if he can play it makes for a quieter trip
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I love fire maple games<br /><br />This one is a bit shorter but still good<br /><br />I recommend it<br /><br />I only wish fire maple would make more games
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I heard about this concert through a workmate and I had to buy it. And now that I have I don't regret
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I originally purchased this for my daughter, but I quickly enjoyed it just as much. Fun and entertaining! Makes you think.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Who would have thunk it ???<br />Sheryl Crow and country ??<br />It' classic Sheryl Crow more than classic country<br />But it works -- especially for women with a certain amount of life experience
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the challenge and how hard it is.  I am stuck on this one level for three days and finally I was able to solve it after two days of playing it.  Now I am stuck on the another level 30 or 31.  I just keep trying and trying.  I am so glad Candy Crush is now on Kindle Fire.  And working just like I wanted to.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Bought the album based on hype plus first single (Mirrors)<br />My whole family from age 9 up hated the rest of the album<br />Very artsy minor key jazz rather than pop<br />Sorry -- I love all music from classic to contemporary -- with the single exception of minor key jazz --
B004P02OJ6|5.0|This is a real good movie and action packed. Russell Crowe is a good actor which made this movie even more exciting. I would highly recommend this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a really good game I recommend it to people who love challenges stuck on level 17 but anyways so fun and its free!!<br />Haha
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Deer Hunter is a very fun game. It's free so I recommend you at least check out out. I always wanted a game like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is challenging enough for all and equally entertaining too...everyone from my 4year old to my 59 year old mother love this game... keep the levels coming!!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Awesome show great recording.<br />I ordered from the USA and got the wrong format so make sure you get a PAL format for the UK. Reordered elsewhere.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie not only entertained my Granddaughter, it entertained my husband and myself. We loved it.At the end of the movie she asked to watch it again and I didn't mind..so it must have been good!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Perfect DVD. Fast easy shipment!!  Great deal for the money. Excellent transaction. I highly recommend this movie. Great for kids and families. Perfect!
B00F35BV64|5.0|The best Star Trek ever. This franchise just keeps getting better and better and better and better.. Waiting for the next one..
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Came in the estimated time, which I rate as fair service. The book did<br />not connect with me as Book 1 of the Trilogy
B00EH0K9H8|5.0|This is the first I've heard that there was a problem with the blu-ray discs. I was curious as to whether the double CD was worth purchasing. It was when I was reviewing the comments about the CD's that I saw that people had been having serious problems with the blu-ray.<br /><br />I've already got the blu-ray (pre-ordered and delivered the day of release...October 17th) and have had no problems whatsoever with the playback. I even froze images so I could send digital images to friends showing how incredible the resolution is. I will admit to only having listened so far to the first few songs...through Odyssey...but it appears the problems people are having are in getting the disc to play at all.<br /><br />It's really sad that this amazing blu-ray has stumbled on release. Flying Colors is an amazing band, and this blu-ray does justice to their masterful music. I've been a fan of Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs for a very long time, and never thought Steve would front a vocal band, much less a great vocal band, but that's exactly what he's done! Here's to all the people who have had problems...I hope they'll be worked out as soon as possible and you all can enjoy this amazing video. Too bad you'll have to wait, but as it was on pre-order, it is worth the wait...I guarantee it!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This was recommended by a friend (typically not a movie I'd pick and I'd never heard of it). But, I ended up loving it. The music is outstanding, the acting/movie is so raw and real. I'd definitely recommend it.
B004JMY312|5.0|I love watching this movie with my wife around Halloween time! The witches in this movie are very goofy and quite hilarious.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I just bought all the decks in the game and the foils for one of them. All of a sudden the app reboots and all the stuff I bought is locked back up and all my credits gone. If you can fix this, maybe I'll rate better.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Entertaining...decent story lines and good characters.  Keeps you waiting for the next episode but not for younger children, ok for teens ect.
B0049J5EOK|5.0|How could you not like the Toy Story movies? They are great for toddlers and are actually a pleasure for the parents as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing it had a bit of everything you would want in a book. I can't wait to read the next book
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Not full of overdone action nor is it droll. A truly wonderful movie with great actors. I love a movie that keeps you guessing. Highly recommend.
030789701X|5.0|Great details on Alchemy and Enchanting. If you are a Elder Scrolls fan it is a must buy. Great collector's item.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|By far the best series on TV. From the actors to the historically accurate set designs, it tops any other show. Especially of the the &#34;reality&#34; junk.
006016848X|5.0|Shipping was very fast. Book is in a very good condition. Very interesting. Will recommend to all couples. I discover a lot of stuff about men
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|This is a wonderful book but make sure you read his other 2 first.  Some of the stories are a bit crazy, but it reinforces the idea of the world of the ego being and illusion.  I don't worry about that but just see through his experience and learn the true Forgiveness and joining with the Holy Spirit.  Also look for his free podcasts on iTunes.  Great stuff, Gary!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am really enjoying my lovely Stephen King's newest book and cannot put it down!! Riveting, suspenseful and thoroughly connects his previous book the Shining. I feel like traveling Jack all over again, oh that's right that's his other book lol!!
B00007GZR5|5.0|A movie so awesome even an Atheist can enjoy this one.  If you are a family man you will enjoy.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I really don't have twenty words to say about this book.  It was really like 50 Shades of Grey.  Ugh
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Reading the book was just like watching the series on TV.  This is a light, funny, easy and enjoyable read.
B00846REIS|1.0|I only purchased this book because I had the third addition.  I almost thought I reading 50 Shades of Grey all over again.
0140157352|5.0|Had to buy this book for a Covenant Group discussion.  It is an easy read and filled with information on how to deal with conflict.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|...but that doesn't matter. Her voice and the music together are unified in such a way that it could be sung in any language and it would be just as beautiful. I love Celine's French albums much more than her English ones. Singing in her native tongue is where her gift truly is. This is by far my favorite of all of her French albums. I can listen to this over and over again. Her voice is beyond beautiful.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Better than I expected.  Addictive and fun to play and best of all...free! Lots of weapons to choose from.  Not bad at all.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I've been playing this for a while and I'm still enjoying it. Haven't seen any problems. Great fun for the price and no ads.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I read this book years ago, and I loved it!  It caught my attention and kept it.  Granted, this series is long and I did stop reading the series after book (I think...) 5 or 6.  The series of books starts doing a POV change in them and I can't stand so many POVs, so be prepared for that if you start this series.<br /><br />This book was and sort of is still a favorite of mine.  :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game incorporates zero skill or strategy it's just the luck of the fall kinda lame but still fun it would just be so much better if it didn't screw you every step of the way
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I suppose the funniest thing about this movie is seeing all the great stars in such a wacky film!  This movie is definitely what you would call a &#34;cult classic.&#34;
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|If you ever wondered why doing drugs was bad for you, just listen to this album.  While Metallica's music is great, it's clear that Lou Reed has spent an excessive amount of time in a drug-addled state.  At least long enough to record a studio album.  There is nothing coherent about the lyrics.  He's randomly throwing words and sentences together and reading them over Metallica's music.<br /><br />Seriously, walk away and don't listen to it.  You will lose respect for everyone involved.  It's too late for me, but save yourself.
B0093X805W|4.0|Story is amusing because of the fantasy and creativity of the chocolate factory.  You want to believe the magic and yet you know it is just a story.  A very funny story with a happy vibe.
B00628RVV0|5.0|It's not often that I'm compelled to write a movie review.  STOP reading reviews and WATCH this movie.  To learn too much about it before going into it might ruin it for you.  Don't even watch the trailer. Not to sound cliched, but I was rendered speechless as the movie trudged to it's climax.
B008XG1X18|5.0|New to Kindle, loving Pinterest...never thought I could see so much about crafts,sewing  and food all in the same place. Everyone should see this a least once.!!!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this is real good and I get interested in the game real easily I love this game<br />it's not a scam not a waste of money I love it
B00005K3NR|5.0|love this movie my daughter seen this for the first time when i received this in the mail she also enjoyed the movie thank you so much it was shipped so fast and played perfect with no flaws
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Wow.  This film was amazing.  I watched it when it was in theaters and really liked it but felt like there was something missing.  Then a friend told me to watch the director's cut.  I didn't own the movie so bought it on a lark.  This blew me away!  There are wonderful plot elements and sub-plots that didn't make it to the theaters that make this a much more rich experience.  It even converted a friend that didn't like it originally but love the director's cut.  I can't suggest this one enough.  Watch it!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I love this CD  the main reason I bought it is because my 16 month grandbaby loves the song wagon wheel and we listen to it in the truck and it helps her fall asleep.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|This movie takes an interesting psychological subject and gives it the scope it deserves.  None of the characters are without fault but all are moving towards a goal of betterment.  It gives the film an incredibly human context while talking about some of the giants of psychology.
B003G4W49C|5.0|excellent plot ,story and characters. what an imagination and putting together of ideas and thoughts to make this story an excellent read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|playing this game is fun and addicting and i can never get enough of it and when it came on the kindle fire i was very excited for it.
039916409X|5.0|The information and exercises are fantastic! They helped me uncover limiting beliefs and trapped emotional memories I had about money that I had No conscious awareness of. I was able to move from a negative emotional place (frustration, anger, guilt, shame, etc) to feeling neutral - No baggage - which allowed me to be in a place of consciously choosing what I want to think and feel about money vs my mind always hitting the 'replay' button. If you are ready to change your relationship with money in a life changing way, buy this book!
1423170644|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter loves this magical story! She usually reads these Read-Along books while in the car however this book is one of her 4 favorites that she reads at home as well.<br /> I love this story myself. It's great!<br /> The book is so beautifully illustrated with such vibrant color and realistic looking characters and scenery.
1577314808|5.0|I love Eckhart Tolle and the way he explains simply how to be present. Thank you for bringing this book into my life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game awesome but can also be frustrating. I play several times a day. Have problems with several levels.  Will continue to the end.
B00EP0SIOG|4.0|This new version of the Sphero is about 2.5 times faster than the prior version and has other enhancements as well including 2 small jump ramps included right in the box. Compared to the prior version, this Sphero seems very quick and nimble.<br /><br />It seems very well built and sturdy, and the charging and Bluetooth pairing works flawlessly. The battery life seems quite good as you can use it for over an hour per charge.<br /><br />This can even be put into a swimming pool and there is an optional tire-like cover for it which makes it possible to move it in water and also protects the Sphero as well.<br /><br />The pairing to an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad works very well (also works with Android but I have no experience with that) and it is fairly easy to control on the touchscreen.<br /><br />But this is not just a remote controlled ball. There are a bunch of apps available that you can use to play augmented reality games with the Sphero. As an example, there is a game where you point your iOS device to the floor where the Sphero is and zombies appear on the screen as if they are on the floor, and you have to roll over them with the Sphero. This is a fun toy for kids who will likely get many hours or enjoyment out of it, especially when combined with some of the apps, of which there are more than 25 as of this review. Adults on the other hand may grow bored with it after a few weeks, however it can still be fun at parties since it lights up and you can change the internal LED color to any color you want.<br /><br />The price seems a bit expensive at first,  but considering all of the technology and R&D involved such as an internal gyrospcope controlling the position of the ball, and Bluetooth controls, etc, it seems about right for what you get.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It would be great if they added a stampede to the game it's boring just to sit and your energy to refill can you make that an update plz
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son is enjoying this game.<br />As it is a puzzle it is teaching him how to resolve a problem.<br />I like this.  Good game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people who love horses and who go horse crazy sometimes I really recommend this game.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This is  great series, my alltime favorite. No problems with the order. Too bad that Ziva left. Also, they made a big mistake in killing Mike Franks.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think the game has great graphics for a kindle and the game is fun to play. It is awsome one of the best tablet games ever
B00F91H666|1.0|Slow with some small action sequences.  Not as cool as I was hoping for... it's less scary/gory and more in the drama category.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Like Fielding's other books (Olivia Joules is a lot of fun), this is a howling, belly-laugh-inducing read. I was sad about M. Darcy too, but how else could Fielding proceed? (If you're stuck on Darcy, do read \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" by PD James). She had to kill him off just as Rowling had to kill off Dumbledore otherwise it would be difficult to have much story. It's romantic comedy! There has to be a love interest.<br />The ludicrous aspects of Twitter and Bridget's entree into social networking are hilarious.<br />Ditto her meetings with film industry executives.<br />And her \\"toy boy\\" and continuing hangups are perfectly consistent with Bridget's endearing character (who by the way exhibits the only important trait there is, unconditional love for her family and friends).<br /><br />And maybe they'll get Daniel Craig for the movie.<br /><br />It's delicious escapism. Don't make it more than it is; just have fun and enjoy it.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|What can i say....keeps getting better and better.  Never thought I would be hooked - watched season 1 with #9, and no looking back!
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Ok. Still like original birds the best. Just can't get into this one. Not a big Star Wars fan anyways. Even seasons was more fun.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|To use a trite phrase - I really couldn't put it down!  A very entertaining book.  Waiting for the sequel!
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Sorry another app I have no idea what it is or why I downloaded it. Again... obviously it was not for me since I deleted it after trying it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app works just like your phone app ( if u don't have an iphone, not sure how they work),  love it, no learning  curve
B0018O4YT0|5.0|This movie starts out as a murder mystery, and then sends you down the rabbit hole. Kiefer Sutherlands acting isn't his best, but the other characters make up for it. Good sci-fi for the mind.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Nice blend of McCartney's various musical phases, especially The Beatles + Wings. Perhaps his most Beatlesque album since breaking from the fab four.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|It was a good story but a struggle to get there, to wordy for me.<br />Could have been a lot more fun to read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I DONT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULDNT READ ANYTHING NEW THAT KING WROTE, BUT FOR THOSE WHO READ THE SHINING ITS A MUST, DANNY TORRENCE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE KING CHARACTERS AND (WITHOUT SPOILERS) THIS ANSWERS ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FAMILY AFTER THE OVERLOOK AND WHAT POWERS HE STILL HAS, IT WASNT SO GOOD JUST BECAUSE ITS A SEQUEL BUT BECAUSE I THINK KING JUST GETS THAT MUCH BETTER EVRYTIME HE WRITES, GREAT BOOK

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very fun game but when you get on level 15 it gets harder it gets harder as you go. I would recommend this game
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Sounds so typical for the way our government has become corrupted..hard to tell it's not a reality show, except if it was it would be a lot more immoral.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|While everyone else was looking forward to this summer blockbuster or that summer blockbuster, this is the movie I wanted to see the most. You might get a mix of many ideas from different movies here but it didn't disappoint in the least. This one had a few surprises around the corner, but it made for a great movie flix. If you give the story line half a chance and see it as just a fun time instead of something overly serious (there are a few serious moments don't get me wrong) then I think you can enjoy what you watch.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Good sequel to a compelling adventure fantasy. The only problem--we have to wait for the next one!  Keep writing Mr. Rothfuss!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game me and my coworkers play together. It is awesome even my youngest daughter plays this game. we love it
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Better than the pc game a real addictive game game play and graphics are outstanding best game I've played in a long time
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|While I enjoy the variety of games and the artwork is great, I find it very frustrating to play because there is so little contrast between the active and inactive tiles.  Also, you have to shuffle so often in order to continue, it's very frustrating.
1616550414|5.0|I love this book so much! It's a great collection, among all my Zelda games and posters! Gives very nice detail on all Zelda games/characters. This also has the infamous timeline inside of it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I was not at all familiar with this show until I saw it on Prime. The 1st show is a little boring and our main character just too deadpan, but wait. It does get better. The stories are thoughtful and the dialog pithy. I would put it almost on par with suits. Really the only two lawyer shows worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited a long time for this game on the kindle! I love it and its the best but highly addictive(;
B004WMKXWM|5.0|This is one of the better Harry Potter movies.  A bit darker, so it may not be as family friendly as some of the earlier movies, but nevertheless a must see for any Harry Potter fan.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works great, super easy to install and a huge saver if you're not going to get cable (like me!).  It shipped super fast and I've been loving it ever since!
B005USZYDU|2.0|Poor ending to the book. Clearly this first book was drawn out with too many law details.  My son struggled to continue reading only to be rewarded with an unfinished story in the end.
B000Q1EZ9A|5.0|This is a gift for my young son who is into musicals and now records of the music.  I received the order in a timely fashion.  The album cover, sleeves and vinyl condition were exactly as described (very good). The packaging was solid and protective. I couldn't be happier - thank you Rock City Books and Records!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very good read at a bargain price. Makes you wonder what is next for the Silo. I will have to look up more of Hugh Howey's work.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This little guy is definitely useful.  I'd much rather pay $10 for this and continue using my old charger than have to buy another MagSafe 2 charger.  Moreover, this has a stronger magnet than the MagSafe 2 charger that my rMBP shipped with, which is really nice.  It's a little small and can definitely get lost easily, but as I only have one MagSafe charger I just leave it attached at all times.

B00FQAZ7PW|2.0|It is never really fair to compare an artist to their earlier works, but it is inevitable... The days of grunge are obviously in the distant memories of PJ and maybe that's OK as long as you are not searching for that punched slightly below the belt feeling of raw emotion and soul searching that used to be the PJ you thought you needed and totally dug. Eddie is way over the top in almost all of the mixes and that could be alright, except the melancholy in his voice sounds like he too has lost and searched for daze gone by. I can almost feel the vexing in his moans as he must think he his connecting with those that built the mighty PJ empire and now find it the clich&eacute; imitation of itself they once mocked as ‘corporate’ or ‘mainstream’ themselves. The lack of any real innovation is what seems so painfully missing in the latest PJ effort and what may continue to haunt them until they can find a way to strip back down to the very core of what they once were, but may never find a way back to again. Otherwise, it is a decent effort from a group of bourgeois rock-n-roll demigods.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been very impressed with this app.  It is much better than any other calendar apps (which have been numerous) that I have used.  I especially like having a full website devoted to helping me use the app, and excellent documentation on that website!!  :-)
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|As other reviewers have stated, this app may not be ideal for learning a language without any prior knowledge of that language. This is due to a lack of grammatical instruction. However it is very useful as a refresher, or for those with a bare bones knowledge of a language. The only other con is the computer sounding voice that does not quite sound like a normal speaker. Overall I have found this app to work better for me than others I have tried.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works pretty well with Chrome.  I don't have netflix and mainly use it for Hulu so I'm hoping they will work on that.  Can lag a little sometimes, but as I said that is when I am using Hulu on Chrome.  Overall I am happy with it!

1845025032|5.0|I have read and love The Gruffalo stories in standard English and Scots. The Scots is my favorite because it's so much fun to read with an accent. I'm American and my husband is Scottish. Neither of us have any trouble reading The Gruffalo in Scots. Some of the words in this book would be difficult for a young American or English reader to understand without some help. I recommend searching for a video of this book being read aloud so you can decide for yourself if it's \\"too difficult\\" or not.<br /><br />\\"A gruffalo? Whit's a gruffalo then?\\"<br />\\"A gruffalo! Whit, dae ye no ken?\\"

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Okay, seriously, 22Learn has done it again! With adorable animals (even crabs, which are my favorite), kids get caught up in the fun of learning. Through the work I do with kids, I discovered that across the board, they love animals more than anything. When the kids played with the animal puzzles, they didn't even realize they were learning.<br /><br />And the sky puzzle kept them completely focused! They loved learning the new words.<br /><br />I completely recommend Alphabet Aquarium! Very fun learning tool!

B0026772N8|4.0|It's good.  Would like more story and less philosophy (or more of the philosophy sifted through the story rather than the character's internal musings that tend to be stilted and rambling), but I'm now inspired to go tackle fixing the scooter in my backyard at least.

B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Schindler's List is a movie directed by Steven Spielberg and was the winner of seven Oscars Awards.  It is a heart wrenching true story that everyone should watch.  The movie starts out in Poland in September 1939 during a time when the German government was requiring all Jews to register with them.  This represented the first grain of sand in an hour glass for which the clock to the Jews genocide had started.  By March of 1940 all Jews had to give up their homes and relocate to the ghettos that were controlled by the SS and the German Army.  Their old homes were given to SS officers and Army Officers.  Oscar Schindler saw an opportunity in the fact that Jews could no longer own businesses.  He convinced many Jewish business people to give him their money to start a metal manufacturing company that would make products for the German war machine.  He initially used some of the money he collected from the Jews to make bribes in order to secure military contracts and eventually used profits to continue making the right people happy.  He hired over three hundred people and had to prove all his workers were essential to his business.  The Army would kill workers at random if they were deemed non-essential.  In March 1943 the German government started the process of liquidating all the ghettos and relocating Jews to either work camps or death camps.  Oscar Schindler's workforce was relocated to one of these work camps and had to make money payoffs to the camps commander.  Word started filtering through the Jewish people that the metal manufacturing company was a safe haven from possible death.  By spring of 1944 it had become known that Jews for being gassed and killed in death camps such as Auschwitz.  Oscar Schindler devised a plan to get nearly 1200 Jews relocated to Brunnlitz, a village in the Czech Republic where he lived.  Due to a clerical error the train with the females and children were sent to Auschwitz and were nearly killed but Schindler's quick thinking andpower helped save them all.  They all eventually made it to their new factories and managed to make worthless munitions and purchased munitions for the military.  When the war ended in 1945, Oscar Schindler fled with his family to Germany because as a member of the Nazi party he was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal.  He later moved to his family to Argentina.  In 1958, he abandoned his family to return to Germany.  He spent the remaining years of his life spending time between Germany and Israel.  He died in 1974.<br /><br /> How this movie relates to World Religion:  Even though one third of the world's Jewish population was killed by the Germans during World War II, a Nazi Catholic was able to save 1200 Jews. This is proof that it only takes one single person to make a difference. Oscar Schindler was accepting of the Jews, he showed them compassion, and he treated them with the love and respect that any human being deserves to be treated with.

B008JFUNKU|5.0|It's not likely that anyone anticipated the possibility of high-seas piracy coming back into style in the post-9/11 world.  But that's what befell the crew of the American cargo ship \\"Maersk Alabama\\" in April 2009, when four Somali pirates took over their vessel, resulting in a three-day ordeal in which the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, was held hostage for a $10 million ransom.  That ransom was never paid; and a team of Navy Seals managed to end the crisis by killing the four pirates, who had been holding Phillips hostage in an escape boat less than two hundred miles from the Somali coast.  Phillips and his crew, however, all survived the horrific ordeal, shaken but alive.  This is the true story told in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, the 2013 docudrama about perhaps the best-known instance of high seas terrorism in our present context.<br /><br />Effectively directed by Paul Greengrass, whose penchant for docudrama was perhaps best established in the much-lauded, and intense, 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stars Tom Hanks in the title role, of the captain who, aware that armed Somali pirates were present in the waters of the Indiana Ocean some six hundred miles east of Somalia, urges his crew to keep a lookout for any skiffs that seem to contain armed men.  One such group, led by Barkhad Abdi, approaches them; but through some skillful maneuvers, they manage to evade them.  The next day, however, the \\"Maersk Alabama\\" isn't so lucky.  Armed with automatic weaponry and with a better knowledge of American cargo ship tactics, Abdi and his four companions board the ship and hold Hanks and a few others hostage (this while Hanks has managed to get the rest of his crew below deck and out of sight).  When one of the hijackers gets his foot badly injured by broken glass, Hanks urges them to get help, and leaves with them in the ship's escape boat.  The pirates believe that Hanks is willing to be a hostage in an act of self-sacrifice; but all along, his crew on the \\"Maersk Alabama\\" are tailing him and his captors; and the decision is made from Washington to end the crisis by the use of the Navy's elite Seal Team Six (the same one that would, in 2011, track down and kill Osama Bin-Laden).  It all comes down to a fierce confrontation within a hundred miles of the Somali coastline.<br /><br />Greengrass' great specialty is in bringing back the idea of documentary-style realism to the cinema, which had proven to be highly successful in his own 2002 opus BLOODY SUNDAY (which was based on the 1972 crackdown of the Irish Republican Army by the British).  In UNITED 93, he told in very stark terms the terrifying saga of the one plane hijacked on 9/11 that didn't reach its intended target because the passengers of that flight fought back against their Al-Qaeda captors.  That same sense of realism infuses CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, with Greengrass and his director of photography Barry Ackroyd doing things largely in the same documentary, almost cinema verite, style that had worked for BLOODY SUNDAY and UNITED 93, resulting in a film that, even if it doesn't surpass UNITED 93, comes very close to it.  But just as much of the success of CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is owed to the incredible Everyman performance of Hanks in the title role.  His ability to do the Everyman role, exemplified in his portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 Ron Howard classic APOLLO 13, works out quite well for him; and Abdi makes for a particularly great adversary.  There is a real sense of Greengrass, as he had done on UNITED 93 (as well as Hanks on APOLLO 13) of not wanting to do everything in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS as your typical Hollywood action blockbuster, and the end result, along with an intense score by Henry Jackman (which also interpolates the climactic cue of John Powell's score for UNITED 93) being the icing on this cake, is a tremendous piece.<br /><br />Indeed, it is on my list of the best movies released in 2013.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This is a good series for young adult readers.  The plot has similarities to THE HUNGER GAMES series.  Good will win over evil, but not until many have died and the main character has suffered immensely.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I have all the season thus far and have watched them all many times. No matter how many times I watch every season, I still find myself laughing a great deal, I truely hope this show goes on for many more seasons.

B000I9W0I8|5.0|I can watch this film again and again and never get tired of it -- which is hard to believe.  Perfectly cast, perfectly acted, taut and exciting.  A real entertainment classic and, I think, the film that really put Keanu Reeves on the map.  Sandra Bullock adorable and believable, too.  Highly recommended.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Very very very good book. I am very sad what happens to Alex. I'd like to see Anthony MAKE a book of Alex after all this.
B00F2362IE|5.0|TMNT was my favorite cartoon back in the day, and they've revamped the series several times- the game is fun!! TMNT will always be popular!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have only seen \\"Les Miserables\\" once on stage and loved the story and the songs. This video has great musical and stage coverage, I felt like I was watching the play for real. Alfie Boe has given life to the story with his great voice and the rest of the cast were well selected to complement the fantastic stage production with their musical talents.
B008K8U13K|2.0|The game works, that's about all I can give it.  Sonic doesn't move fluidly, the graphics are cluttered and bland, and the constant switching up of gimmicks makes the gameplay clunky at best.<br /><br />Not a good game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best hunting game on Amazon it is way better than deer hunter reloaded the graphics are amazing the controls are smooth and easy and one of my favorite improvements is that unlike every other glu game I've ever played you don't have to buy glu credits to advance they have it so that there is a gun that you can buy with money for every mission there is still that energy bar which I hate but it seems to refill faster and last longer than other glu games it is challenging but just the right amount when you start off it is easy but as you get better the game gets more challenging so it's never easy but it's also never impossibly hard I highly recommend this game I haven't put it down since I got it
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|It took me a little while to get into this one, I’m a huge QOTSA  fan and after 2 years of hearing Josh say they were “back to the Robot Rock”, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed that this wasn’t the self titled album again.<br />The only track that caught my attention on the first listen was “Smooth Sailing”, honestly if you go no further the album price is worth this song.<br />The more I listened the more I found myself craving the others, “If I had a tail” is amazing, “My God is the Sun” the first single is pretty great in its own right. The rest are a bit slower but are probably some of the best compositions J-ho and crew have penned to date. “I appear Missing” is haunting; “I Sat By the Ocean” makes me wish I had a corona.<br />If you’re looking for a repeat of their earlier works you won’t find it here, what you will find is a great album from a band that reinvents itself every 5 years. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game! So addicted and just started playing a couple of days ago. Very popular game<br />So you have lots of people to help you w hen you need life in the game
B00000JXZ7|5.0|This is an awesome album from a true virtuoso of the violin. The Mendelssohn concerto is probably the most well known work here, but I bought it for the Bruch violin concerto in G which I heard (in another recording) on Pandora internet radio and immediately wanted to hear again.<br /><br />This is classical music of the Romantic era, played with appropriate passion. Bruch's Scottish Fantasia is also a stirring piece which deserves to be more widely known. And Ms. Chung has to be one of the all-time great violinists. I will certainly check out some of her other recordings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved it! but mAde me cry in the end!<br />read thus book it's simply amazing and you will love it also
B00DW1WR14|5.0|This band just gets better with each release. There is not one song here that could be called a filler. Do yourself a favor and buy 3 copies of this CD. One to play, one as a substitute and one for your best friend. PJ you RULE!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've heard friends talk about this game with a lot of enthusiasm.  When I finally tried it I can only agree, it's a lot of fun &amp; challenges you to think ahead.
B006O5YHUY|3.0|Good action flick, but story is bland ,and the ending  was predictable, and could have been more impactful. The dialogue is often &#34;Rocky&#34; philly style...three worder lines.

140006922X|5.0|This is another of the new analysis of the life of Jesus, and although some others have approached from relatively the same perspective, this author nails it with his interpretation of the life as one of a radical political leader. Having been reared in the strict tenets of an institution which professes to be the one founded by Jesus and his convert Peter, it has been refreshing to read such books as this one which finally looks at the person as he probably really was at the time and place. A person of such profoundness and supposedly spiritual crucification, it is odd that there are no historical recordings of him in any of the legitimate historical.<br />He was at the right place at the right time. Read the works of Zoroaster (530 BC) you will find that nothing Jesus said was original.<br />As a political leader he knew how to appeal to the poor, downtrodden, enslaved, disenfranchised -- as it does today through the many organized religions that preach but do not practice any of the basic principles laid down by Jesus. The promise of a better life in the hereafter is very, very appealing to many, even today, who see no hope of such a life in their present circumstanced.<br />Keeping in mind that the council of Nicaea AD 325 was ordered by Emperor Constantine because the many Christian factions were fighting among themselves and causing fractures in his empire. The fighting leaders had to come up with a united literature that all would accept and unify the church to the pleasure of Constantine. It was a politically acceptable document. Not surprising \\"\\"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\\" is probably one of the best political dance step one could possibly have developed. The Nicean Creed which came out of that council is purely, and practically, a pledge of allegiance.<br />The whole history of the Christian organized religions have been political.<br /><br />Hopefully others will show the courage of this authorand continue to explore this political scam which has caused more wars and the deaths of millions of people, while holding out a dream of a better life.<br /><br />Time to look at Jesus and his life for what it really was, not what those most to gain in wealth and power have propagandized it to be.<br /><br />This book is a good beginning for those who really want to seek the truth.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a very challenging yet entertaining game and is worth 5 stars!! I recommend it for all ages.
0393338827|2.0|Michael Lewis has built a reputation as a result of \\"Liar's Poker\\", his over-the-top account of couple of years working in the bond department of Salomon Brothers back in the 1980s.<br /><br />An overrated work, in my view, and not in the same league as a book like \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\".<br /><br />This attempt to describe the financial meltdown of 2008 that saw long established banks go bust or taken over or even bailed out by the American government is in similar trenchant style to \\"Liar's Poker\\".<br /><br />We are supposed to believe this calamity was brought about by banks trading in mortgage-backed securities consisting of loans granted to people in no condition to repay them.<br /><br />Maybe it was but, instead of explaining a very complicated situation, Lewis plays to the gallery and presents a rant rather than a convincing explanation of what went wrong.<br /><br />His liking for foul language becomes tiring, as do inarticulate quotes from unappealing characters like: \\"But the more we looked at what a COD really was, the more we were like `Holy ****, that's just ******* crazy. That's fraud.\\"<br /><br />A book that sheds more heat than light.
B005XUC398|3.0|Some very good acting in this flick but the movie moved along too s-l-o-w. You really don't know what the problem is until fairly along in the plot. It's discovered by an underling after receiving a flash drive from a co-worker who was just fired. You really don't know why he was fired except that the firm cleans house every so often. So the underling who was given this flash drive starts looking at its contents and calls his younger co-worker back to the office after hours to confirm what he finds. That's just it. You really don't know what he finds except that its really bad. Then the executives get called in and the remainder of the movie is about what course of action to take. It's really about making a choice. The movie was good but the ending was not. That's why I gave it three stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that's it's finally on the Kindle. Better bigger screen to see the game. And very addictive game on all devices.
B00631VJLE|4.0|With a few decades together and five studio albums under their belt, it's safe to say that Italy's finest metal import, Lacuna Coil, have pretty much mastered their sound by now. There's a sort of confidence present throughout the group's sixth offering, \\"Dark Adrenaline,\\" that can only come from a band who has paid their dues and worked tirelessly to stay relevant whilst staying as true to their manifesto as possible. Though 2009 saw a slight mis-step with the appropriately-titled \\"Shallow Life,\\" fans (new and old, die-hard and fair-weather) will be pleasantly surprised to find the group back in top form, with a rock solid 12 song set that rivals the quality of whatever dramatic hard-rock/heavy metal is dominating the airwaves nowadays.<br /><br />Sounds like: Something the band could have released between their landmark album, \\"Comalies,\\" and its followup, \\"Karmacode.\\"<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Don Gilmore's production doesn't suppress the bombastic nature of the band's music, but rather, harnesses it and utilizes it for maximum impact. This is probably the finest sounding Lacuna Coil record to date.<br /><br />- There is a perfect balance struck between vocalists Andrea Ferro and perennial Revolver pin-up Cristina Scabbia.<br /><br />- The overall style of the album recalls old-school Lacuna Coil without feeling like a retread. Other career bands take note: this is how you stay true to your roots without dumbing things down.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- The bonus DVD, \\"Dark Passengers\\" is hardly worth the price of admission. A series of horror-themed vignettes set to a backdrop of choice \\"Dark Adrenaline\\" cuts, it's a decent and creative idea that unfortunately doesn't live up to its potential. At less than 20 minutes long, I hesitate to call it a waste of money, but it's something you should be watching for free on YouTube, not shelling out five extra dollars to see.<br /><br />Hits:<br /><br />- \\"Kill The Light\\" and \\"Give Me Something More\\" are the perfect marriage of heavy and catchy, as only Lacuna Coil can deliver.<br /><br />- A surprisingly stunning cover of R.E.M.'s \\"Losing My Religion\\" captures the dark essence of the original and is a natural fit for the album.<br /><br />- \\"My Spirit,\\" a tribute to fallen Type O Negative frontman/bassist Peter Steele, affectionately apes the style of the aforementioned band without being trite or pandering. It's a gorgeous song, an admirable tribute and the perfect way to cap off the album.<br /><br />Misses:<br /><br />- Though the album isn't perfect, there isn't a song on here that doesn't fit in. Well played, Lacuna Coil.<br /><br />Best Listened to When: You are tripping the darkness and losing your religion.<br /><br />Personally:<br /><br />I had all but written off Lacuna Coil with \\"Shallow Life.\\" It seemed at the time that they were trying to paint themselves as the next Evanescence, which was a major turn-off for a band of such high caliber (and this is coming from a guy who will still occasionally spin Evanescence's \\"Fallen\\"). \\"Dark Adrenaline\\" gets things back on track, and it's no surprise that this has been their most commercially successful outing to date. Here's hoping they can keep the ball rolling with the follow-up (which is due out sometime next year).<br /><br />The Bottom Line(s):<br /><br />This is a true, blue Lacuna Coil album. It sounds great, it's big, it's bold, it's operatic and it's riddled with hooks. Everything you've come to love about the band is injected into \\"Dark Adrenaline.\\"perfect marriage of heavy and catchy, as only Lacuna Coil can deliver.<br /><br />- A surprisingly stunning cover of R.E.M.'s \\"Losing My Religion\\" captures the dark essence of the original and is a natural fit for the album.<br /><br />- \\"My Spirit,\\" a tribute to fallen Type O Negative frontman/bassist Peter Steele, affectionately apes the style of the aforementioned band without being trite or pandering.

B002UWH8P6|5.0|This show is great - it has drama and has lots of sci fi tech stuff - I wish this series never ended! I want more!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is very action-packed and I thought that it was interesting. I would recommend this book to someone who likes Greek mythology or fiction books.
0375851569|5.0|Nothing new or original can be said about Dr. Seuss that hasn't already been said.  Each time I read one of these books to my grandchildren, I laugh aloud at his excellent cartoon illustrations and those of the &#34;unknown&#34; animals are a hoot.  Some adults are nervous about reading one of these books without a shill - a 5-year old sitting on your knee - but go ahead and give it a whirl.  We know that when no one else is home that you sometimes secretly watch the cartoon channel.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I knew she had a beautiful voice and she was a great role model for those of us who have a few things left on our bucket lists and certainly as was said, \\"she gave the WORLD the biggest wake up call ever!\\" I've always been one for the underdog and Susan became a whole lot of peoples heroine! He voice is both dramatic and gentle. The other songs on the CD that I had not heard her sing before were most impressive and sung with all her heart. I hope things continue to rise for her in the best way possible![[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]]
0785153942|3.0|This summer, I watched and subsequently fell in love with the movie \\"Pacific Rim,\\" Guillermo del Toro's love letter to kaiju movies and giant mecha anime.  While not an Oscar contender, it was a fun and epic film that had a surprising amount of heart, likable characters that weren't just stock stereotypes, and an exciting and entertaining (if not entirely original) plot.  I hadn't had that much fun at the movies in years, and when I heard there was a \\"prequel\\" comic, I knew I had to read it.  The film had packed a LOT of exposition into its first five minutes, and I figured it would be fun and interesting to get a look at what happened in the film's world between the first Kaiju attack and the rest of the movie proper.<br /><br />Having read the comic, I am... mixed in feeling.  The book lacks a lot of the spectacle and majesty of the film, and while it does go into the origins of the Jaegers and provide some essential backstory for a few of the movie's characters, many of the story elements feel either clich&eacute; or inadequate.<br /><br />The comic is essentially a series of vignettes strung together by the narrative framework of a reporter, Naomi, who's collecting stories from those involved in the Jaeger program for a fluff piece of journalism.  Along the way she interviews two familiar faces from the film -- Tendo Choi and Marshal Pentecost -- as well as an unknown third character, one of the original creators of the first Jaegers.  Each man tells their own tale of how they became involved in the Kaiju War, the losses they suffered, and the contributions they made to the program.  We also get glimpses of Mako Mori as a child and how she came into Marshal's care, and get a look at Raleigh and Yancy Beckett as reckless young men who join the Jaeger program on a whim, only to become two of its star pilots.  Some interesting questions are answered, and in the end Naomi may get a lot more than the fluffy \\"why we fight\\" story she was looking for.<br /><br />I'll begin by talking about the art -- it's bland and uninteresting.  A lot of the human faces look wonky, and there are some weird and even creepy anatomy mistakes, especially with Dr. Lightcap (who gets a lot of badly drawn nude scenes, though the \\"naughty\\" bits are covered with convenient light and smoke effects).  The Jaegers and Kaiju are competently drawn, but the few fight scenes we see in the comic lack the \\"oomph\\" one comes to expect from robot vs. monster smackdowns.  Maybe I've been spoiled in regards to comic artwork by IDW's Transformers comics -- the art and fight scenes in those generally range from good to fantastic -- but the art of this does nothing for me and could have been a lot better.<br /><br />The stories of this volume are largely hit and miss, though admittedly more of them are \\"hits\\" than \\"misses.\\"  I enjoyed seeing Raleigh and Yancy again, and their introduction as cocky and reckless young men felt natural to me, seeing as they're still somewhat in that stage when we first see them in the film.  And Tendo's story is one of the most affecting and powerful in the comic, placing Tendo at the scene of the first Kaiju attack and showing the heroic lengths he goes to in order to save a loved one from the destruction.  It was also nice meeting Marshal's co-pilot for the first time, and seeing the faces behind the Jaeger program.<br /><br />The misses in the book do drag it down, however.  We get not one, but two tired \\"love triangle\\" plots, one between the two Jaeger designers and one of the original Jaeger pilots, and another between the Beckett brothers and the reporter.  This is a plotline that's been repeated ad nauseam in stories before, and it really wasn't needed in this comic at all, let alone on two separate occasions.  While we do see Mako a few times, it would have been nice to see how she made the transition from frightened young orphan to determined Jaeger-pilot recruit.  And I'm a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see the other pilots -- seriously, no love for the Cherno Alpha or Crimson Typhoon teams?  If they ever make another comic spinoff of the movie, I expect to see them in it.<br /><br />The book contains a foreword by the writer and a \\"making-of\\" feature in the back that shows some sample sketches from the making of the book.  Neither of these added a whole lot, however, and could have been left out without any problem.<br /><br />If you loved \\"Pacific Rim,\\" this book is a rather underwhelming follow-up.  While it does provide some backstory for the characters, most of the information within can be easily found online.  About the only reason to purchase this for yourself is for Tendo's story, which is by far the best in the book.  The rest is pretty lackluster, and I only hope that if more PR comics are made, they're handled by a better artist and given more thought.seriously, no love for the Cherno Alpha or Crimson Typhoon teams?

B00005JNBQ|5.0|What can I say about the great Napoleon Dynamite? First off, you either love it or don't get it. If it is your first time watching it, I suggest watching it with people who love it, makes the film much more enjoyable. As for me, its sitting on my shelf next to airplane, white chicks, and other great comedy.

0316232955|5.0|this book literally changed my life. The meaning and feeling behind every sentence is wonderfully written. 2 4 6 8 I heard you like to fornicate!
B0042816YK|5.0|Though the book is even more amazing, this movie does Liss' work justice. I give Elizabeth Gilbert so much credit for her openness, honest and willingness to share her memoirs...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|An amazing work of fiction. I am just sad that the book is over. A unique love story of unlikely characters that makes you invested as if you are part of the plot.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I think that 4 stars would be good for me why because it is a little cunfusing and weird suckers that made this needs to step it up.
