B009FZHYKU|5.0|Survival, extensive Character development, post-apocalyptic mayhem, and zombie killing- This show has it all!  Since season one, this show has kept me on the edge of my seat drawing me into a dark and twisted world with the candle light of civilization still burning within each member of group that's still alive. This season has seen some crazy changes to the group (People keep dying!) and some great additions (Sword chopping Michonne and Morgan!). With the addition of Woodbury rivalry its anyone's guess what will happen next. Season 3 is has been the best to date! Cant wait to see what happens next.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a series that requires readers to stay with it.  It can become a bit tedious, and it's easy for folks to miss what's happening if they're only focussed on the sexual activity.  There's a deeper message here.  I won't point it out here but I have done so while encouraging friend who had become bored with it and were on the verge of abandoning the trilogy.  They're glad they stayed with it.  In all honesty, it probably could have been condensed into two books.
B00BVYRLYC|5.0|Intriguing show that gets better with each episode. Love it! If you're into action and adventure, you'll dig this show.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Bought this Blu-ray because it was cheap last Christmas...I love Leonardo's new stuff, and this movie is good.  If you like mysteries, suspense, and Leo, pick up a copy.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It's easy to see how this documentary won the Acadamy Award.  It is very compelling.  A piece of Rock N Roll History. A happy ending.
B001CDLATE|5.0|You may fall asleep while watch it att he end. But you will try to watch it again and again. Super video quality.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great book, and a huge eye opener. It describes how habits work and influence our daily lives and how publicity and other industries use this knowledge to get people to consume. Its a book to read once through, and then come back and study it , if you want to really understand the process of building and changing habits.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Such a fun and cute game! Its awesome watching my dragons hatch and evolve. Enjoy playing as a way to unwind! Would recommend to everyone!
B000001DQG|5.0|the cd came on time. the music is from my era and sounds great.  you cant beat the price either.
B005HSL626|4.0|I choose this rating because the game is fun to play.  I would recomend it to a friend, but it too does not give instructions on how<br />to play.  I get by for now because the person that told me about it gave me a couple of pointers on how to play
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son recommended this game.  Downloaded it 3 days ago and none of us have stopped playing it.  Way more fun than petville or farmville, the missions really are do-able and you can earn a mad lot of coins really fast.  Wholesome fun.
B0063M22QO|5.0|love to play this game it helps pass the time.<br />easy to play and can be played with others.<br />I highly reccomend this game
0802473156|5.0|This was recommended to me by my beautician and friend.  It is a great book and worth the read.  I still have more of it to read.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game fine but the ones who really like it are my grandkids they have a blast with it.  I would recomend
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The animation is perfect in this ode to video games of the late 70's and early 80's.  I really liked how the movie created a back story behind the games, in a magical realism sort of way.<br /><br />Also, the voiceover cast is perfect, and there's a great message at the end for kids of all ages.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband is disabled and this game has helped him to take his mind from the pain he is in. It challenges him and engages his mind. Very fun and helpful
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A compelling read by a good souther story teller. As a matter of fact, this is one of Grisham's best yet....
B00499QUK2|5.0|These PBS Sherlock Holmes are so terrific.  Smart, quick and entertaining.  The only problem is there are only three per season
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was  really good ready to read the next part to this three book series I'm gonna have to read every book they come out with
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Well done, Ethan Hawk is very good actor.  It is very suspenseful and entertaining. If you enjoy this kind of movie I would recommend it.
0375869840|5.0|My 3 year old son loves this book.  We also have the ebook version on our iPad,so my son follows along in the real book as Grover and Elmo get closer and closer to the monster at the end of the book.  He can now recite the book almost word for word.  I thought he had just memorized it, but when we point out words individually and ask him what the words are he actually knows what they are!  Such a delight to have a 3 yr old that is reading and enjoying books!
B00993G41S|4.0|Jamie Lee Curtis looks great and still does today.  I especially love the scene where Kevin Cline devours the fish, poor Wanda.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is fun and challenging. The technique is simular to Mario in the 80's. My nine and five year old finds the game a fun challenge.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love every single episode, even the slow ones!  I am not even a horror/gory movie fan, but i just love the walking dead.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have a none and five year old that loves this game. The puzzles are challenging enough that makes my boys learn to work as a team to finish a puzzle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|awesome read..held my attention from the start..Katnis is a bad chick. She is also very young and vulnerable which makes her easy to relate to.  Suzanne should continue the series!
B0076DELIG|5.0|as usual Michael did a splendid job in writing this book. spell bounding from top to finish . i could not put it down for very long
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I have seen this movie about 20 times.  It's a great movie for all ages.  It's quirky, magical and romantic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way of relaxing and settling down. i especially like the ease of taking it with me to the DR
B000NA28HU|3.0|I had read the books and was greatly impressed that a 19-year old could do such a great job at fantasy writing. I just had to see the movie. It was pretty good. Jeremy Irons does a great job at being a good-guy for a change from his usual bad-guy personna.
B008458O3S|5.0|For the logically minded, this is a fun game.  The idea is simple.  You draw tracks to get your train(s) from start to finish.  But the levels grow progressively challenging.  In the end, I was able to solve all but the two most diabolical levels without using cheats--this includes completing the bonus levels.  In fact, those last two remain unfinished to this day, even though I have restarted from the beginning.  This is more of a brain teaser than you would suspect.  Well worth the download.  5 stars all the way!
0375826726|4.0|An enjoyable addition to the story of a boy and his dragon. Very impressive for a 19-year old boy to write such a good fantasy book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Most sophisticated hidden object app I've played on my tablet.  It was challenging and had a good story line.  The graphics worked great on my tablet, too.  I didn't have to use the map much either so that's another star for the app, too.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I was a little hesitant in watching this series, wasn't sure what to think of the first episode. But knowing I like ABC past shows I knew I'd like this one. I'm so glad I did! It's murder mystery and teen drama and I just had to watch the next and the next to find out more! Who is A?! What will happen next?! :)
B0060QM09M|5.0|I've read all of these before but still can find enjoyment in remembering those episodes which have been forgotten over the years.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Lots of fun. Who would have thought that infecting the planet could be so fun and informative. Love the news feed.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Earth Rocker is the tenth full-length album from Clutch, the unique American rock band (who's style fits vaguely around the Stoner Rock end of the spectrum without fitting perfectly in). It was produced by Machine and released on Weathermaker Music in 2013.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Clutch before, but like any sort of Hard Rock or Metal music you should consider checking them out. They are the sort of band that once you hear, you love forever, absolutely consistent in quality and inspiration both live and in the studio. If you even suspect you may like them, I highly recommend that you pursue that interest, you'll probably discover your new favourite band.<br /><br />Sometimes the band seem like a no-surprises purist rock band, designed for a bar full of working men, but then sometimes they'll break out a metallic edge for a few riffs, sometimes they take a turn into funk, soul or blues territory. It all blends perfectly together, into some of the most memorable and attention grabbing music you're likely to hear. Two of the main adjectives you'll see associate with the band are `personality' and `character.'<br /><br />Neil Fallon, the band's iconic frontman continues to impress the listener with his dramatic and charismatic vocals, which evoke both a zealous preacher-man and a down-to-earth work colleague at the same time, full of flair and personality, but without feeling like an inaccessible rock star.<br /><br />The lyrics, always interesting on a Clutch record, are a mixture of moods and tones, from clever and poetic to dumb rock fun, funny, intriguing and insightful, often within a single verse. The album also has a surprisingly political tone in places, balanced of course with things like a song about dumping your Robot-girlfriend for a newer model. As always you'll find little lyrical gems that you just can't wait to tell somebody about.<br /><br />Clutch aren't just a one-personality band however, each musician is a master of his instrument, there are bass lines and drum fills that will stick in your head for days just as easily as any quirky lyric or memorable vocal hook. Some of J.P Gaster's little touches on the bells or floor tom will bring a smile to your face, and Tim Sult throws in little leads here and there that elevate the songs to new levels. Dan Maines ties it all together masterfully with big grooves and solid clunky drive.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the band already, you may wonder what direction the band have taken this time around. Is it further down the path of `Pigtown Blues' and `Basket Of Eggs,' is it a return to their earliest Hardcore roots, or is it a radical departure into Lounge Jazz?<br /><br />The album opens with the storming and bombastic one-two punch of the Title-Track and `Crucial Velocity,' the former sounding like a mixture of `Pure Rock Fury' and `Power Player' and the latter sounding like a vaugue mixture of `Minatour' and `Mercury' without repeating either. It's a solid statement of intent. Together, they set the tone for the whole album quite nicely, that being Clutch's characteristic personality filled music, with a few of the lessons they learned exploring their bluesy latter day albums, added to the top of the bombastic and masterfully produced sound and style of their Blast Tyrant and Robot Hive period. Elsewhere, `Unto The Breach' and `Book, Saddle And Go' keep up that fire and energy.<br /><br />The band do add some balance with `D.C Sound Attack' which would fit well into either of this album's predecessors, since it containing harmonica, cowbells and a bluesy Five Horse Johnson (a band with whom Clutch frequently collaborate) feel in general, as well as the fine acoustic track `Gone Cold' which is a haunting and hypnotic slow number that provides a great counterpoint to all the fast rock songs.<br /><br />You could sum it up as being one of Clutch's most direct, fast and hard hitting albums to date, but that would be all ignoring the variety on offer from the acoustic track to the proggy direction at the end of `Oh Isabella.' You could say it's a step away from their bluesy work, but that would be ignoring things like the blues tinge on the fast riff of `Unto The Breach' and the harmonica on `D.C Sound Attack.' You could say it's a return to Robot Hive and Blast Tyrant, but it's a lot shorter and more focused.<br /><br />Overall, its just a strong set of songs. A damn, damn strong set of songs. Its lean, memorable and there is nothing in the way of filler. It all flows well together, the levels of musicianship are high, it sounds fantastic due to its marvelous production job and it has a lot of character. If you like Clutch already it is a must-have, it's a fresh and vital sounding blast of Clutch doing what they do best with enough of a twist not to sound like they're repeating themselves. If you are new to the band, it would be a great place to start. If you buy this album and love it, all the better, because you've got about two decade's worth of almost flawless back catalogue to fall in love with afterwards.ustic track to the proggy direction at the end of `Oh Isabella.'

B00BLGZDYA|5.0|This movie doesn't make any sense, but as an art form, it doesn't have to.  It's beautifully filmed, the acting is superb, and the makeup artists really did a great job.  Just enjoy the show!
B00004WG2F|4.0|LIFE TIME SAGA.. THIS IS BRAD PITTS MOVIE, AND MY FAVORITE OF ALL HIS MOVIES. IT'S LONG, BUT ACTUALLY NOT LONG ENOUGH, SEEMS THE HOURS JUST FLY BY AND LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE.. AND THE SCENERY IS AMAZING..HAPPY THERE ARE STILL THESE TYPE OF SPACES IN THE US..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a really good read, I enjoyed every page of it!<br />The only downside that threw me off a little bit is that it is written in letter-form. But what's interesting with that is that you can see the development of the narrator. The language was casual, but it's intended that way. The ideas though, are extraordinary!<br />I recommend this book to everyone!
0800141601|4.0|THIS STORY OF SIR LANCELOT IS DIFFERENT, BUT VERY ENJOYABLE TO WATCH..THE SCENERY IS BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S FULL OF ACTION..
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. I have worked with patients that suffer with mental illness, and I lost a brother that suffered from severe anxiety and bipolar. This book is so sincere. I loved the characters in the book.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Love, love, love Thrift Shop.  I am over 60 and I love rocking out to this song, my husband is closer to 70 and we get up and dance to it!  I was standing in line at a store and I heard a woman around 26 years old behind me singing it, and I chimed in with her and we were singing  it together.<br /><br />The song Neon Cathedral is beautiful.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I cannot wait for season 3 to start. Very good battle or fight scenes, and the characters are portraited as real people. Good acting. And lastly the places where this series is filmed is stunningly beautiful and captivating. Very breathtaking views and filming.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm big Bond fan. I rate this as a must-see for the casual Bond viewers; one of my top 5 favourites in the series so far.<br /><br />My disc arrived with a defect, and the customer service from Amazon was stellar!! They really took great care of me, thanks!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Took some time to get use to the format and set-up of this game.  Seemed to be backwards from others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am addicted to walking dead love it you should def watch all seasons you will never want to stop watching
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Enjoying this one more than I thought I would.  Like that I can come back to it after a distraction.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|I got a good deal on this and couldn't pass up the price.  I loved this movie growing up, and hopefully my kids will love it as much as I did.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Stuffed full of 80's nerd culture references. It's got a good plot and characters, but who cares! Enjoy the geekery!! In what other book could you possibly have Mechagodzilla face off against Ultraman? Brilliant, not very deep, but amazingly good fun.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|As with the Bridges app, this is an OK app.  Actually, kept my attention for a lot longer than<br />the Bridges app.  But here also, it became kind of boring/monotonous after a while.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book had me looking at life at a whole different set of eye's read it and your life will never be the same.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I am giving this an 'unfair' review.  I tried it for a little bit, but it did not hold my attention<br />for very long.  Guess I'm not very musical inclined possibly.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|people that say this film is unconventional should stop already. if you want conventional, don't watch a Paul Thomas Anderson film. go watch the latest studio produced, focus group reviewed, and horribly acted movie at your local mega-plex cinema. if you want to see a smart, thought provoking, amazingly performed, directed, and beautifully shot film then watch this movie. what's so great about a conventional plot and an all-tied up ending anyway? you just want the film to go the way you want it to go and you're uncomfortable with anything that challenges your own ideas. this movie is brilliant. watching the two lead actors in every scene is mind-blowing and very inspiring. when you watch this film you'll be watching a lot of humans doing some of the best work of their lives. and yes, it's that good. it's not conventional, but it is amazing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|What's not to like about playing a game of solitaire when you have some time to sit and<br />relax.  This is a good app.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|This is a great video for Rush fans to watch.  The concert is interspersed with skits showing the band members throughout time.  Really good show.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|As with my other Angry Birds app, I do like this one too.  Some people do not like<br />Angry Birds, but I am enjoying it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it but way too short. Anxious to read the next one. Loving Gideon cross by the way. Very sexy
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like this app a lot.  Now I can check my mail where ever I take my Kindle Fire.  I don't know<br />what took me soooo long to download and install this one!
1616550414|5.0|awesome i loved it and got it for a great price, couldnt get it any more cheaper than this :)
B0035LJY6C|3.0|This was just an OK one.  I sure liked the TV version of the family a whole lot better than this.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon.  I would definitely order from here again.  Thank You.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This  was an 'OK' product.  For my particular taste, it was not as exciting as I thought<br />it would be when I picked it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon.  I would definitely order from here again.  Thank You.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I don't know, but I may be a little simple.  I did not find ANY magic in this Magic Puzzle<br />app.  I guess maybe I'm not a 'Puzzle' person (at least not with the android apps).  I<br />do like working 'real life' puzzles, however.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the hourly forecast and all of the other screens and options that the Weather Channel app contains.  I have the app installed on all of my devices so that's it's always handy.
B000V63C4Y|4.0|this is my all time favorite of the bossa genre. nice rhythms; easy listening; smooth jazz there is something about the &#34;romance&#34; language that is intriguing.
B000HZED8S|4.0|Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon.  I would definitely order from here again.  Thank You.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Thus was by far my favorite hidden object game. For the price this game is definitely one of the best. The story line is intriguing and the graphics are great. I had no problems running it on my kindle fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon.  I would definitely order from here again.  Thank You.
B0091X13G2|4.0|Just like most action movies, don't expect the most original story, but the writing and characters are solid and definitely put this one above any of those movies built on cheesy one-liners.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon.  I would definitely order from here again.  Thank You.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is a love genius and it shows in this book!<br /><br />I would reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of romance stories
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very Good, I am glad that I choose this from Amazon.  I would definitely order from here again.  Thank You.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It has a great plot and themes. The story is engaging and moves along great. Plus it doesn't waste time with silly and unnecessary love senses. I loved reading this book.
0316228532|2.0|If you want to spend 8 hours or more of your life feeling awful, read this book. Every time you think something good will happen it gets worse. The writing wasn't bad and there was only a typo or two. And she is, of course, good at telling a story. But it left me feeling terrible. There are no redeeming lessons, no inspiring passages. Nothing even resembling redemption in this book.  Just an in depth look at the absolute worst of humanity. Save yourself the mental cleansing I now need and read something else. I wish I had.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|A classic, it was a great read!! I honestly read this in a couple of days. On story better than the last. I recommend reading it.
B00006FR47|5.0|Man this cd really takes me back, some real great tunes on this one, I would rank it up there w/ Chicago's 1st & 2nd albums. good price w/Amazon too.
B0042L78MG|5.0|Caro Emerald is my new favorite female vocalist.  This cd has everything- jazz, pop, swing...Caro delivers it all!  I am always looking for new music to play in my office (I'm a high school counselor) and even students say they think this music is cool.  I wish she was going to be in Las Vegas when i go there in June so I could see her in person:-)  If you like smooth, sultry, sexy, fun and flirty music, you will love Caro Emerald!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was awesome, just wish the ending cleared things up more, but all-in-all great book! Would be a great beach read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! Keep them coming. It's so intense and well written and directed. Can't wit to see what more is in store
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show!  The episodes just get better and better, but they do seem a bit short.  They might be so good, the episode just flies by!
B0013ANMWY|1.0|The first Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie, back in the 1950s, was so effective that the studio changed the ending before releasing it, to avoid terrifying audiences. Even in this mutilated form, it was a powerful and effective movie.<br /><br />The second, in the 1970s, starring Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy, was beautifully done, funny, terrifying, well-acted, and haunted me for weeks.<br /><br />The third, in the 1990s, set on a military base, was also effective.<br /><br />So I've liked every variation on the theme until now. But \\"The Invasion\\" was just godawful. I wanted to like it, but five minutes into it, I realized with a sinking feeling that I was already just waiting for it to be over.  Nicole Kidman is Godawful in it.  Just horrible. Her performance is vacuous and empty.  If she were turned into a pod person, I don't think I've have noticed a difference. The writing is also terrible, a pastiche of everything bland and bad that a Hollywood movie can serve up.  The contrived happy ending only makes the movie worse.<br /><br />I was anticipating liking the movie so much that I bought the DVD without reading any reviews; watched it once; then threw the DVD away.  Uck. I don't own it anymore and it still leaves a bad taste.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I would recommend this video.  It made me want to start cooking.  The movie came when it was promised and was in excellent condition.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It's very easy to navigate, doesn't have pop ups, and does take a long time to loo load. I would strongly recommend this app, it's great.
B0042816YK|5.0|I love the movie and glad I own it.  The movie came quickly, at least near the first date given if not before.  It was in excellent condition, wrapped and unbroken seal.  It played well  and had no problems.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|He tries new things, some work, some don't. It's been that way since the 70's. But the ones that work are so much better than anything else out there. I'm a fan - I saw Bowie in concert 30 years ago, and also rate &#34;Reality&#34; and &#34;Heathen&#34; are 2 of my favorites.<br />The Next Day sounds like vintage Bowie, but at the same time it sounds very current. I only hope Peter Gabriel listens to this and gives us something similar!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|The movie arrived in time.  It was wrapped and was in perfect shape.  The movie played well and was everything I expected.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I want my money back. It takes up way to much space on my kindle fire. Don't get me wrong it's a fun app and for right price. But I want a refund please. :-(
B004F5GLJ0|2.0|not good - kind of boring, found myself wondering why I was watching this, maybe it appeal more to teen girls.  Bella got on my nerves with her one note acting as well.
B004JOCU2O|5.0|I took the 5th time I watched it till the adrenaline rush wore off. I think it's a very well done movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a great game for those of us who don't really play games. . and except for the pop-ups that occur after every deal, EVERY DEAL!, it is very good and easy to use on the Kindle Fire HD
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. It is nice to use a calculator with large buttons and which is easy to read. Highly recommended for Kindle Fire users.
0307719219|5.0|I read \\"Why Nations Fail\\" after going through several other books about development.<br /><br />Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" seems like a very good explanation of the world in the year 1700.  I find it less convincing as an account of why development rates have varied since then.  Although they had similar geographical conditions the different European peoples have had very different experiences in transferring their political-economic cultures to other continents.  The Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and French had large non-European colonies but none of them turned into large countries with European-level Human Development Index scores.  By contrast, the English speaking countries of North America and Australasia have similar development levels to the United Kingdom.<br /><br />A similar problem arises with the geographical arguments of Jeffrey Sachs in \\"The End of Poverty\\" which suggests (among other things) that countries far from their markets tend to be poor.  If this is the determining factor then you would expect countries located on important trade routes to be particularly prosperous.  The Egyptians and Panamanians should be rich and the New Zealanders should be doing their laundry.  The relative prosperity of remote Australasian countries seems confirm the importance of the \\"inclusive institutions\\" praised in \\"Why Nations Fail\\".<br /><br />I found the broad historical approach of Why Nations Fail to be very appealing.  There is an in depth account of the early European settlement of Virginia and Australia which succeeded, according to the authors, because of \\"inclusive institutions\\".  There are also many horror stories of kleptocracies that failed because of their \\"extractive institutions\\".<br /><br />At the end of the book, I became slightly impatient with the authors' reluctance to offer any policy prescriptions.  Part of this is probably due to the failures of the global lending conditions imposed by the so-called \\"Washington Consensus\\" such as the cutting of import duties and privatizing of state owned industries.  The supporters of these measures rarely mention that when the UK and USA were developing in the 19th century they had high tariffs and publicly owned utilities were common.<br /><br />If the global lenders were to create some useful forms of conditionality, they should include policies from early era capitalism such as free business registration for sole proprietorships.  When the World Bank started publishing statistics on business registration costs in 2004 there were only 11 countries where the cost of registering a business was under 2.5 % of the average annual income of the country concerned.  Seven of them were English speaking.  We do not know how far back this goes in time but it may well have always been part of English economic culture to allow business owners to become tax-payers automatically (without a formal permit process).  This type of thing strengthens the market and the state at the same time.  Legal tax-paying means the business owners can prove the value of their enterprises.  The state is able to collect revenue.<br /><br />In one sense, however, the authors are very wise to avoid policy prescriptions.  They quickly become dated.  As it stands, I think their \\"inclusive institutions\\" theory is the most accurate explanation of the variation in development rates between different countries.  Their theory is subtle and simple at the same time.  It is readily understandable but it is subtle in the sense that it avoids panaceas.  It will probably look like a convincing argument long into the future.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I liked this book enough to finish it... but for the life of me... I kept asking myself why bother.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was more detailed than the movie.  I love Nicholas Spark books.  Have read about everyone of his books, keep writing them nicholas
0061900656|5.0|Love this book! My 2 year old is about to be a big brother and we bought it for him when the baby comes. The text is simple and interesting, he is going to love it too. =)
B009NNG202|3.0|it definately keeps you interested to see how it ends..it's a combination of other murder movies..<br />not a movie for the squirmish
B0086HGW42|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from Ed Sheeran but I have actually ended up really liking his music. He's a good artist.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This movie is not only sick, scary, gory and sexy (that word doesn't seem to fit), it is absolutely fantastic. Recommended for the true horror fans.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't consider myself a fan of the horror genre and I am the first to become sickened at the squelching noises made by zombies' heads being bashed in by machetes, baseball bats, etc. . . . , but I love this show. I think it's the storyline and the suspense and the action combined. I began by watching to the first two seasons on Netflix and then, moved to Amazon video when I realized that I had missed the first half of the third season. Now that I am caught up and have to wait for the new episode every Sunday night like everyone else, I've been experiencing some withdrawals. It was nice not to have to forward through commercials or wait week to week for the next episode. Oh, well . . .
B005OK722U|2.0|Oh my, what happened here. I don't know what to say. Words cannot and should not be able to describe what a disappointing piece of crap this is. Sorry. Stay away.
B005T5MX6K|4.0|Keeps you intetested in it plus some of the guys are good looking good little plot worth watching again good tobbery movie
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Like a novel  with instructions.. Funny? yes... Instructive? Yes.. Inspirational? Most definitely.<br />Get it if you want to know more stuff about writing...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the fact that I can adjust the background light on the droid, which I can't do on my old Kindle.  I still use the Kindle a lot, but it's nice to have options.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best series out there...must see for sure!!! Better than True Blood in my opinion, if you never have seen this series, you will not be disappointed.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Oh my goodness, Shirly MacLaine is a selfish, odd person.  This story of Sachi's life with and without her mother is heart breaking, beyond weird and I finished thinking either she is lying or her mother is the devil!  She seemed authentic and I enjoyed the story.  Fast, easy read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My only complaint is I wish the coins renewed faster! Also it has locked up on me a few times, but not too often.
B00A17AD36|4.0|sometimes somber mood.  great R&B.  very original tracks.  was digging this album the first time i heard a some from it on the radio.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A beautifully written story of rural Ireland with an unexpected twist at the end. Some of the humour was real 'laugh out loud', some was pure whimsy. The characters were larger than life but at the same time contained real truths about the human condition. I really enjoyed The Misremembered Man and look forward further work from the author.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|ACA-SCUSE ME?!?!? This movie was flipping hilarious!! I watched it three times when I rented it... Thanks Amazon for the instant video app!!!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Great GREAT board for any AMD enthusiast. Gigabyte includes some awesome overclocking tools, supports both SLI and Crossfire which is nice.  Larger board, with plenty of room for a nice big 120mm cpu cooler [would get low pro mem modules for a 140mm cpu cooler]<br /><br />I got my AMD 8120 OC'd to 5ghz on this board with an H100 and some patience in OCing.<br /><br />easytune6 is decent, but compared to some research and patience it proves to be obsolete.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This show makes me want to go find me a bad boy out there and have him teach me how to shoot a gun!! Jax is too smart for his own good!!! I'm so glad Stahl is gone... I hate that tramp!! ATF blows... I love this show... like I'm obsessed with Charlie Hunnam!!!
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Seriously, great thermal management, stays nice and cool even at a 5ghz overclock.<br /><br />I went from 3.2 to 5ghz with A LOT OF PATIENCE and research.  took my time, clocked slowly, 42 hours burn in with Prime, paired with the ga990fxa-ud3 this is a great budget kit for people looking to get plenty of power at a good price point.<br /><br />be warned though, overclocking takes patience and plenty of knowledge. If you don't know what you are doing, don't over clock. be sure you have all the bases covered before breaking your comfort zone.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|SPOILER: Drogo dies and I wanted to die with him!! LOL<br /><br />No really this show is freaking amazing. Although I get lost with the families I'm glad wikipedia kept me up to par with who was who! LOL I hate Jeoffrey and hope he dies... damn little boys should not RULE .. Poor Ned and his the Stark household... losing a father is devasting. I want his daughter to suffer and be sent back to Winterfell!! STUPID GIRL!!! Great production... great scenes and great actors!!! Jason Momoa you sexy beast!!! I can't wait for season 2... because Kaleesi is going to make all bend a knee with her baby dragons!!!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|infact this is the best budget/starter cooler on the market, inexpensive, effective, and nice size.  Not to loud. I replaced the fans with noctua fans and couldn't have been happier
B003M70O5O|5.0|This has to be one of the baddest shows ever!! When I say BAD I mean... AMAZING!! I love the entire concept and plot of the show!! I always wondered about guys on motorcyles and when I see a patch I always go wondering... I know it's just a show but I know there are clubs out there that are similar!! Its just a sexy way of life... that I probably don't find myself living, but I LOVE WATCHING IT!!!
B008JFUNQO|5.0|I saw this movie at a prescreening event at my local theater. I went in without any expectations as I hadn't seen any of the advertisements other than movie posters. When I left the theater, I was more than pleased. The version showed at the event was in 3D. I found it to be very exceptional as I noticed it the whole way through without getting lost in it. It enhanced my movie going experience with the amount of depth that was perceived. It literally felt like looking into a box.<br /><br />This is a movie that succeeds as a family movie. In my opinion, there weren't any questionable content at any point in the film. My kids enjoyed it and asked if we could buy it when it comes out.<br /><br />One thing I did notice about this movie is there many elements taken from the Ice Age franchise. I don't want to divulge too much as to include spoilers but when watching the movie, I recommend you matching this movie against each of the Ice Ages and you will see many similarities.<br /><br />Overall, the movie had heart and a lot of funny moments. I wouldn't be surprised if it was followed by a sequel.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My youngest grandson of 4 yrs. loves this game and he plays it whenever he is here. He down loads other free games as well.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|It was an interesting movie I'm glad I got it for when I want to watch something different or  unique thanks
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I love being able to turn the moon around and look at the side that we never see. I also enjoy this app when it is to cloudy to see the moon.
B00005JMX6|3.0|I really like this movie but this is why I'm hessatant on buying used movie the distibuter will say oh this movies is in great shape blahblah blah and I get the movie and the bottom of the DVD holder is messed up so the movie might be fine but the cassette holding isn't always great like in this case
B006HL9G10|3.0|Bells are nice. The problem is the interface is hard to understand. It needs a one-click type of control. I have been playing with it for days now and still can't make it nicely.
0316067598|5.0|we really enjoyed the account of Marcus luttrell, It was recommended to us from our eye doctor whom we share books with.<br />we in turn bought  this book for my grandson.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Was impressed with the motherboards construction and heat dissipation fins.  Out of the box, the FX8350 worked with this motherboard.  With that said, it does not come with the BIOS that &#34;supports&#34; the FX8350.  here is where some of these modern motherboards shine:<br /><br />Because of the dual BIOS capabilities of the motherboard it made flashing the bios easy (using a thumb drive with the bios on it).<br /><br />The dual BIOS meant (for me) that a copy of the previous bios could be kept in reserve in case you needed it.  In fact, I made a mistake during the BIOS flashing process, and the motherboard restored its factory default bios for me from the secondary BIOS storage.  If that feature had not been there ... it probably would have meant sending the motherboard back to the manufacturer.<br /><br />I am well pleased with the performance I am having (running it for 3 months now).
B00007FOMP|5.0|marvin gaye's voice and style in music could never be duplicated. my mom had this album back in the day and i grew up listening to him and many other great artists who sang of various things like love, current events, even pain. that was and still is music and it is great to be able to find such greatness through amazon, thank you.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Very good quality, as expected from a Seiko.  For the price, this is the best value around and looks great.  The only thing keep this from 5 stars is the power reserve is low, so you need to wear it every other day, to keep it wound, or it'll die on you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really hope Andrea dies soon... also, this show has totally changed my life. I now look at everyone as lifeless and imagine myself stabbing them through the eye
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A very timely plot and very entertaining book.  Clancy continues to include timely issues in a fictional plot and this one was hard to put down once I got started.  I think this was a return to the Clancy of old.  Well written and engaging characters that kept the interest throughout the book.  A favorite of many books of this genre written during the past year
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book  it is a story of a great American that will stay with me.  It was hard to put the book down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Enjoyed the story and the look back way of reliving the whole thing. Unique and exciting, a fun way to kill a few hours!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the intensity and the ferocity of their love. The writing style make you feel the pain, frustration and love of the characters.
B003W77SAS|5.0|I had this years ago but between several moves I seem to have lost it. Glad to have it back in my collection. Great cd.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book started out as every other sappy teenage love story but some unexpected turns made me really enjoy reading this one ! I could not put it down !
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this...I am so addicted that I play on my kindle and my phone..sometimes at the same time! Worth the download for sure.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|I don't play this game but my daughter loves this game, keeps her entertained for hours, so its worth it to me
0345803493|5.0|Love this series and was dying until this book came out. Can't wait to get started on the last book! It just gets better and better.
B005974CNA|5.0|Super Band! Super musicians! I recomend it everybody! I am looking forward their new works. I think it will be great as usually.
B009CG11WY|5.0|Ermahgerd. I have loved this movie ever since my mom brought it home for me. &#34;If you keep eating your hand, you won't have any room for lunch.&#34; - Bender
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|5/5. This movie came well packaged and there were no problems with it when I used it. The came with different language options also which i enjoyed. The movie itself was well put together and the animation was terrific.
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Vary informative and closly relistice of a little know event in US history. Interesting aspect of taking it from the layers point of few.
B0078XGJQQ|5.0|I really needed a kick up the whatsit as I was not only taking my wonderful life for granted, but finding lots to complain about. This has brought me back on track and for that I am truly grateful (pardon the pun which you'll get when you read it lol)
B0000683DH|3.0|In the original series Khan and kirk were faced in a battle and now in the 2nd movie, he returns. the first star trek film I felt was carried out to long and wasn't to enjoyable. this one is my favorite except for Generations. I'd give it three stars because it lost it's thrill after being played on telivision repeatadly.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Not one likeable character.  Expected something special with all the talent in this film, and it was a total waste of time..
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was. very spellbinding,,the suspense is awesome.this is one of his best,,I recommend this to all readers,must read it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this modern Sherlock but it is fantastic!  Martin Freeman and The Cumberbatch are a great team.  More please!
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME YET SCARY BOOK I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I FINISH BOOK 3!NOW I HAVE TO TYPE 5 MORE WORDS!!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|fun view of time and time travel  I missed the show in original release - so glad I was able to catch up with it here
B00633W614|3.0|I found the plot of this book to be quite contrived and predictable. The dialog was stiff and not all that believable. I give it 3 stars instead of 2 only because it was such an easy read and I didn't have to force myself to read it. In short, by my standards this isn't a very good book and I don't set my standards particularly high.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|trite - but actors just cannot convey all the info the author an put in text.  I couldn't put it down
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Perfect for my needs and saved me having to get it done by another entity.  Just wanted to have slides and negatives shown as photos on a computer.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Alabama Shakes offers a rich soul sound beyond the pop hit slog that is on the radio today. Enjoy the whole album.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My first Nicholas Sparks, definitely not my last.  I like the mystery that catches me fast and keeps me interested.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Rented and watched this after it received all of it's fan fare, and because my daughter really wanted to see it. I can say that the cinematography was amazing, and the visual effects, both CGI and not, were amazing. However I felt the story kind of fell short, spending a lot of time on small pieces of the story and not enough on others. Overall a good watch, but just have realistic expectations.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|As an animal lover I loved the development of the relationship between the main character and the tiger.  I was in tears when watching the scene where the main character cradled the tiger's head in his lap so as to comfort the tiger and show the tiger his love for him.
B00942X8PY|3.0|I understand the majority of these puzzles but there are some that I just don't know what to do, let alone how to solve them.  I found that after about 1 day, I left this game alone.  I wish this game came with more instructions. Some of the puzzles are not as intuitive as others.
030746363X|2.0|A friend had dropped quite a bit of weight and i wanted to know how. He said &#34;4-hour body&#34; ... had never heard of it. I bought the book and asked him a question about it and used &#34;4HB&#34; as an acronym... he had no idea what i was talking about. Seems his partner bought the book and my friend just did what he was told. Maybe that's the answer. This book has too much info and unfortunately, on back cover says, &#34;to lose 20 lbs. in 30 days, go to page...&#34; That is where I went and he says, &#34;if you want to know more, read the next chapter&#34; but let me tell you, this is scary to NOT know more, because i dropped weight in the first two days. i was even enjoying what i was eating, with beans and eggs... and I upped my water intake... but I did that &#34;for me&#34; not for what was needed. And on the evening of day 3, I passed out because I had not eliminated what needed to be eliminated. For those who are smart and careful, i guess it works. It's just a lot of information to &#34;put out there&#34; and hope that people are responsible.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|This game is not so fun.  I downloaded it for my kids, but it's not that easy to know what you are supposed to do.  It was good for a day, then I removed it from my device.  Don't recommend.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|In my mid-twenties I loved Dan Brown's novels and the mixture of history, science, religion, philosophy with drama, great characters, a fast pace, and adventure. They were written to be consumed like a feast for the intellectually deprived. However, this novel was far more Blah, Blah, Blah than that. It was, as if, Brown was trying to proselytize. And there was much I had to just skip over to get back to the actual story line. This will probably be my last Dan Brown novel. But now that I'm not in my mid-twenties, I have little need to be convinced of the wonders of our minds and world...give me the drama, adventure, and characters.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Watched Argo this past weekend. Frankly, the idea that this one Best Picture has me stumped. Was it well done? Yes. Was it really the best film in America last year? God, I hope not.
1400052181|5.0|The book was fascinating!  It presented an important history that continues to affect our health today in a very readable and authentic fashion.
B002YCVWXQ|4.0|But I did enjoy this movie. Of course, like all Tarantino films, it was gratuitous, but Brad Pitt made it truly enjoyable. I've seen it several times now, and would watch it again.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Lite concern for detail with decent drama. Well acted, directed and cast. Just don't accept as \\"real\\" history. Would still recommend for sense of the times.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|A simple yet compelling tale of a man trying to conquer his demons and make up for a lost life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it!  5 stars!!  favorite app!!!  amazing ideas!!!!  great tasty food!!!!  never bored with this app!!!!!  everyone should use it!!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I like many others read the Kite Runner first, then I decided to see what other books Khalid Hosseini wrote afterwards.  I read this one and was amazed.  The tale is different, but the reality of the day to day situations and problems the characters face are just as real and he puts your mind in the story.  He does a great job at developing his characters and describing the scene to you.  I loved this book as much as the Kite Runner, if not a little more.  I highly recommend this one.
B001NHNG64|3.0|The book is ok., but Jack is a little to mukch.  You never feel that he is in trouble because he is better at everything than anybody else.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book of the three part series really drew me in and made me HAVE to buy Catching Fire the second I finished this book!  Such an interesting concept and totally amazing imagination Suzanne Collins has in this book, I really enjoyed reading it.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  Read it before you see the movie America, you will appreciate it more.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|At first it was simplistic and boring but it picked up as it went and became interesting and more intelligent then it first seemed
B006S8QB2O|5.0|I love this movie...it is such a great movie.  Basically, Gere is looking for something else in life...something that will make him happy and he doesn't want to tell his wife because he doesn't want her to think she has been making him unhappy...because it is not her.  So one day he sees a dance school from the train he is on and sees Jennifer Lopez looking out the window.<br /><br />Jennifer is also unhappy...and her story will slowly be told in the movie...they both find their happiness and it is to dance and still live the lives they were living before!<br /><br />The cast is great!  It will make you smile and laugh!  You will not be disappointed!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I never saw the original series so I didn't have any expectations. I love Johnny Depp but this movie was just okay.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|Lets acknowledge off the top that this is very well written history.  It is troubled by the electronic presentation.  The book is full of words broken for no reason and while it does not distract too much from an easy read it can give you pause while trying to comprehend what has been presented.  The most disturbing thing about the book are the maps.  Each map, or almost each, is on a page by itself.  Great, you may say, but not so much since each is about one by two  inches.  I wonder when publishers will step up to making a decent presentation of scholarly books in electronic format.  The approach right now is obviously the cheapest way possible.
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|this is a fun 1 v 1 game, its one of my favorites, and is very addicting. definantly worth the one dollar.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun to play must try it you will love it very much try it out you will have fun so try it
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't remember who recomended it .  I think I just saw it on line. I gave it  five stars because it is more than just a nice thing to have.  It has become an essential link to information from all aspects of my life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|game is so fun and addicting to play I own the game on Pc and enjoy playing it on both it is also great for all ages
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Full paced, a great read. Typical Jack Reacher, very enjoyable. Well done with a believable plot. I found this one easy to follow.
B009K86D86|5.0|I work in the food manufacturing business and this film only touches on how man has bastardized our food. Everything is engineered now for look, taste, color, mouth feel. Everything from your produce, to salad dressing to your morning cereal has been engineered buy food chemists
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you love Susan Boyle, then this CD is a must-have! If you haven't heard hear yet, buy  this CD. I promise you that you will be glad you did!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I can't believe I have to go thru this extremely stupid review process to archive this book.  As good as TV
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Everyone is expendable in this show, which keeps you on your toes. Plot moves with every episode, there's no season long cliff hangers.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Each season keeps getting better.  We missed most of season 6, so cannot wait for Season 6 to come to CD.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This is one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. While the acting is good the plot is confusing and nonsensical at best and has absolutely no redemptive value whatsoever. It's one of those films for which the very best parts were shown in the two minute trailer. The luckless viewer hangs on until the bitter end, hoping against all hope for some scrap of meaning that might justify the waste of time and money spent to view the film. She will be left sorely disappointed.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I love this series.  My wife did not start watching this show until just recently.  Cannot believe what we were missing.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|Not close to the whole concert was a disapointment.  It is missing a lot of signature songs.  Still lots of great stuff for the Beach Boy Fan. Very entertaining, just incomplete.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I watched the series and enjoyed it very much.  Thought we would like to have it in Blu Ray DVD so we can watch it in full at some later date.
B00919CI5Q|4.0|Card was nice looking. Wasn't any quieter than the gigabyte 6870 3 fan card it replaced. I only played Borderlands 1. While battling the last boss the screen was completely washed out. Everything was tinted white. Had it installed for 2 days and got 3 windows cannot start errors at boot up. Figured the drivers did not like my system. Returned it to J@R Music waiting for refund. For your reference using an Asrock Z68PRO 3, Windows 7 64 bit. There is a review on silentpcreview of the Asus 7870 which describes the DC11 cooler on the last page. I agree with their analyses. Cooler is underwhelming because of thin fan design. Adequate but nothing special.
B0053O89JM|5.0|this was the final season and the last to my collection.  my 16 yr old and I loved this show and hated to see it go off the air.  now we well have it forever.  an ok price for the item.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Is a good movie to pass time to if you have already watched it and if not , a must see. A fun classic that entertains.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|We enjoyed this with our grandchildren and they wanted to watch it again.  Feel it is a good movie for the whole family.
B0093QDGEO|3.0|We bought this from Amazon Online for a ski-trip. Several of the people in the cabin decided they wanted to see this so we purchased it online.  The general consensus of the group was it was OK, nothing to write home about.  I'm a pretty big movie fanatic, and to be honest I wasn't really impressed.  It's just another slap-stick funny remake.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is a thought provoking movie that is beautiful.  The story is great,  well told along with unbelievable footage.  This is a movie we will watch again and again.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|It was a cute movie.  My 13 year old also thought it was good.  You find yourself rooting for them!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Watching this movie made me wonder if it really happens.  I'm sure it does.  Loved the way it played out and ended with the main character taking responsibility for his role in the flight.
B005K17RU0|5.0|gives weather  10 days ahead, and hourly reports. It is very helpful to people who travel and wonder what to wear
B001AXME2S|5.0|This is my favorite one they have done.  Powerful vocals and great lyrics.  Its a  good addition to any collection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was on a waiting list for months and finally got this book. I could not put it down once I started and read it in12 hours. I have told my sister and daughter to read it.
B003UBTX6S|1.0|The writing is very poor, the writing techniques are flawed, and the characters are ridiculous. I really liked the movie even though the first book wasn't written that well. That's why I took a whack at the second book, but it was not worth it. The book just drags on and on. I haven't even been able to finish it, and I only have about 50-100 pages to go! Bleh.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I listened to 3 of their songs and loved them so much I bought the album shortly after. I wasn't disappointed. There are a bunch of different songs, almost different styles even, you won't get bored!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this for my daughter.  My son has had the same model for over a yer and he lives it!  It fits great, and really protects the kindle.  I would highly recommend it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|This is definitely a good movie.  They distort a few historical things to their liking, but overall it's worth a rent.  I dont know if it really reaches to the level of Best Picture Winner.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I'll be honest, I was not a fan of the Circle album as much as it hurts me to admit that after being a Bon Jovi fan for almost 30 years.  This album has restored my faith.  Many great songs!  They still kill it live no matter what they play!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Wonderful story, a little unbelievable but a great story. It pulls at your emotions, and keeps you cheering for their success.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Even after all these years the characters continue to evolve and the story lines and writing continue to be funny.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|A BIT LIKE MODERN DAY MILLS AND BOON. MADE FOR THE MASSES. LOST SAID LOTS READ. ONE BOOK IS ENOUGH
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love the graphics! I gave it 4 stars because you can only run as oz. I would rate it 5 stars if they add more characters.<br /><br />P.s.I played it on kindle fire hd
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|this was a fun movie to watch. very exciting action scenes and story line<br />i would watch this movie again!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz I thought was far different from the movie. I also thought it was better than the movie.<br /><br />There is no place like home.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|this is a cute movie to watch. only thing keeping my rating at 4 is<br />this is very similar to few girl movies from the past few years<br />i would watch again when its free
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Good story and rich writing do it for me every time. This book just has it. I love any book that transports in character and narrative.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This was a slow starter for me, but a trusted friend said to see it through the first season.  The acting is mostly superb, especially in the main scientist character Walter Bishop. He is a pleasure to watch no matter what he does. The plot seems to be getting more intricate and that is good. I'm almost finished with the first season and yes I will be watching more.
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|RDJ makes this movie, that's not a slight to anyone else, he just owns his role.  The Pecker is pretty awesome too.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It has everything: music, graphic art, drama, philosophy(existential angst), sex, drugs, rock and roll, history; the whole she-bang.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|One of Bin Jovis greatest cd! Worth the wait for them to release a new album and Jonstill has it!!! My idol!
B00005YU1O|5.0|Thought provoking and terrific, wonderful, awesome, Austin-tatious, creative, timeless, smart, great, Loved It, WoW, colorful, lovely - Watch It Now!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|There is no reason not to get this app. It is strictly better than the built in battery monitor and is free.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Daniel Craig is NOT a credible James Bond.<br />The Q character is really annoying.<br />Judy Dench is way too old for her part.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|At the very end of the book there's suddenly an odd chapter saying &#34;Hey what happened?&#34; in which the author explains book four was so large, he had to make it into book 4 and 5. Instead of telling half the story of all the characters, he decided to tell the full story of half the characters. Unfortunately for me, the reader, the first half (book four) are the characters I'm not as invested in. The story focuses solely on King's Landing. It's not a bad book, but I wish he'd explained at the beginning so I didn't wonder WTF happened to Arya, Jon, Dany, etc.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have now read all three books and found them all very entertaining. Good story lines, good characters and well written. As I am a new Kindle user I also found this to be a great way to read a book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is an amazing book in the series-honestly sets you up to be a bit confused and disappointed with the fourth. A lot of characters die, so be ready to get very upset.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great follow up to an interesting &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and I have already finished the third book too. The series was very entertaining and I recommend it for any Sy-Fy fan.
0143118706|3.0|I really loved EAT PRAY LOVE... but was a little disappointed by this book.  I never really got into it...and found my mind straying a lot.  I hope she writes another one soon!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It was a really GOOD movie! I can't wait to watch it again! So funny, but still serious! Love this movie. Good Actors and Director!
0345529057|5.0|I love this series.  I decided I needed to read the books once I fell in love with the series on HBO.  I'm so glad I did!  Making the commitment to 1,000+ page books is no small thing, but treading the books makes the series that much richer for me.  I can't think of another author in this genre i like more, and I can't wait for the next book.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|This book confirmed what I already knew: a degree doesn't make you a writer...doing what's in your DNA does. So I intend to write on and do it for the pure NEED of it. Boom.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This was a very suspenseful show. Couldn't wait for the next installment. Much better than expected. Will watch the rest of the episodes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had already seen the movie so was curious what the book was like. I absolutely loved it. Can't wait to start the second book.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|ICO is everything a puzzle-platformer should be. The story and characters, while minimal, are both interesting enough and the castle itself is a joy to figure one's way through.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus was also a lot of fun with a very intriguing (though, again, minimal) overarching plot. The idea of nothing but boss battles is one I really enjoyed, and the fact Agro (the horse) had his own AI was a nice touch from the usual mount-as-organic-taxi route taken by most games. Wander does control a little sluggishly when climbing and fighting, but as I understand it that's actually a feature rather than a bug; the folks at Team ICO wanted to make more human and identifiable and less the perfect-reflexes, undaunted-by-all Standard Video Game Protagonist. The only thing kept it from also being excellent in my estimation is the fact the camera is absolutely atrocious. I've played the rare game in which I occasionally felt I was fighting the camera as much as the enemy on screen. Playing SotC was the first time I've felt I was fighting the camera *more* than the enemy, especially against the last few colossi. Which is not to say it's unplayable, or even that the camera prevented me enjoying the game; I both beat and rather liked it, I just, unfortunately, felt I was battling the camera throughout most of it as well.<br /><br />Both games are *very* pretty and tell fun little minimalist stories, and for $20 I'd absolutely recommend picking up the collection. Just be aware of the main issue with SotC going in (and try not to spoil yourself if you can help it - on either game, but particularly on SotC) and I'm sure you'll enjoy them as much as I did.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like to get up early, but don't wake easily. This alarm clock has tye best features I've seen for sound sleepers: increasing volume, different alarm sounds, different shut off features, and you can set it for multiple times.
B000HBKCDC|3.0|couple good songs,2 for sure,but the rest are kinda lame and dont  remind be of the holiday seasons i remember
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|This movie starts off slow. What I mean is this movie pulls you in slowly and makes you want to see how it ends.  I wish they make more movies like this that tells a story.
0765325950|4.0|I've been reading these books for over 10 years now - since high school - and I sit here in shock after finishing this tonight. It's hard to believe it's finally ended and what an ending! After the incredible build up of the last few books and soooo many characters, I was really worried that how one final book could wrap everything up. Thankfully my skepticism wasn't rewarded this time and I am satisfied with the resolution. 1/4 of the book was spent on preparation for The Last Battle and the remainder at the battle itself and yet somehow, despite the fighting and strategies and endless death...I felt I got the character resolutions that I needed which is what I was worried about. What a journey...
B001N3EZW2|5.0|Love it.  One of my old time favorite movie.  Very clear on my Kindle. I know it doesn't have the new tech....it's from back in the day, but I still like it.
0744014549|5.0|This is an amazing art book as far as art books go.  The developers offer plenty of insight into developing the characters and the environments, as well as extremely hi-res pictures of every character close up, which was amazing to see.  Lot's of detail here.  The environments is why I bought the book, and the book doesn't disappoint, offering pages of beautiful art on almost every \\"area\\" in the game.  A definite buy for fans of the game wanting to know more about this mysterious and beautiful island.
B000N8LWHE|5.0|This movie is great.  It's one of those old time cowboy movies.  Has fighting, tenderness....just an all around good feel movie.  Oldie but goodie.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing it twice on T.V. (with the commercials every 10 minutes). This movie had plenty of action and some great motorcycle scenes. Fantastic. A Great Film.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Enjoy being able to access the weather at any time without turning the TV or radio on.  It is user friendly.
B00AH6BHF4|5.0|Covers, new tunes, classic Metallica sound.  Fantastic.  Wanted singles but they aren't available, so I had to buy the entire album.  For once I am glad I did.  Outstanding album.
0307352153|5.0|This book helps to understand why people are the way they are and to be accepting of each other. Read it!
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|..but know every song from youtube - I could NOT WAIT to get my hands on this CD. I love these guys - fun and innovative with great covers but even better original works. Walk off the earth is as entertaining to watch - hope someday I get to see them live - when they are in my part of the world (Phoenix AZ) THANK YOU for the great music!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love the style and layout of this particular sim. being able to set everything up and go to bed and have it run in the background is awesome.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving a rating of 4 is due to the requirements for expanding beyond 3 to 4 plots without buying the necessary items from the store.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love the game, just wish it wasn't almost 2 weeks behind with Amazon app store totally worth the wait but better safe then sorry...... definitely worth the 99cents you pay for it though
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is for everyone.  We all have fun and get to help each other when we get stuck.  Kind of like the old family games. Keeper!
0060557818|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend, he is currently reading it and says it is pretty good, he isnt much of a reader but tends to like the author alot.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Kids love this and it is very funny to watch that frog/monster green thing eat.  The poor guy looks underfed.  Keeps them busy.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It is probably a great book...but his writing style was difficult for me to get into.He would jump back and forth from chapter to chapter...so I lost interest.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app for my kids!  Makes it much easier to let my kids play our kindle!  They can play the games that I approve and not accidentally go to the app store and make purchases.  It's perfect for us!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved Fifty Shades...LOVED, LOVED, the Crossfire books. Definitely recommend reading. The overall theme is the same as Fifty..but the characters are very different.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Loved the whole series of the Gilmores. Was very happy with final episode : Luke and Lorelai back together and Rory walking away from Logan. Ended without  leaving anything hanging as so many series have in the past. Can't say enough how great this final year was.<br />Jake 47
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I don't know how to describe this movie.  It done SO WELL, it is SO believable, it has you just dissolved in tears a great deal of the time.  BUT, you can't stop watching, the story line is so great, it is done so well, the suspense is so great, you just have to keep watching.  A MOST entertaining movie !!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I was looking for a case for my new Kindle Fire HD 7 and selected this one from the many that Amazon offers.  I could not be happier with it.  The reason I selected this particular case was because it is slim and the device fits in the case with brackets around the edge, not with an envelop style enclosure.  I learned from having several cases for my previous tablet that having a block of colored, bulky material around the face of the tablet was annoying, cumbersome, and distracting.  The Fire HD is a very sleek device and this cover keeps it that way while providing protection.  I was also happy to see that the dimensions were only slightly larger than my previous Kindle case - something that I have used and enjoyed for several years.<br /><br />In terms of colors, I wasn't sure about the orange, but it is a rich, fairly deep color.  It is not overwhelmingly bright.  I also like the grained finished on the outside.  It keeps it secure in your hands.  All in all, this is a great value.
B0081336FO|5.0|This show keeps me on the edge of my seat with every episode, and I love the bits of humor thrown in here and there as well. I highly recommend it!
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This was an excellent movie!  It can be a little hard to follow at first due to do many people to follow but I would highly recommend it to anyone.. This movie has a lot of big names in it as well.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Just what i needed for getting into my car, the house, and reading paperwork in dim lit places.Don`t what i did without it.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|my grand daughter is hooked!!  We loved it and will watch it often.  Just a  great movie for a family night
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works great on my Samsung GS3. For my E books, And other documents for work. It been a life saver.
0446547573|5.0|all of Nicholas Sparks books are great.<br />need I way more.<br />Highly recommend it to his readers<br />great movie also
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I found the book to be somewhat enlightening. There were however questions that were not answered for me. This might not be the norm though. I can definitely see validity in what is being said to make any union more enduring. It certainly puts a common goal for both partners to work on things.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was a well written book by a funny lady. This was not a book of jokes but rather a life story with some helpful advice along the way.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Kids mystic creatures talking animals, an evil queen and her army.  The This book is full of adventure love and at the same time war. The movie and book are very similar I really wish they would make a movie fir the first book too.  Can't wait  to read the next it's been hard so far to stop reading.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Not enjoyable to play. Graphics too fast...hard to follow. Would not recommend this as a good way to pass the time.
B009329ZF2|5.0|The most important quality I find with Amazon's video steaming service, it produces results. Not just ho-hum but stella. Not some or most of the time- ALL the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can build anything you want you can find diamonds, iron , red stone, and much more only if they can update it more then it would be perfect
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|The most important quality I find with Amazon's video steaming service, it produces results. Not just ho-hum but stella. Not some or most of the time- ALL the time. This is a must watch!
B000YDAYCW|4.0|Love the look of these boots. However, for me some pain and chafing occurred on my ankles. I made sure my laces were tied tightly, which helped slightly. Also, the sole began peel a bit in the back. The boots are great for walking in the snow and repelling water. Hopefully my ankle pain will go away with more and more use.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The most important quality I find with Amazon's video steaming service, it produces results. Not just ho-hum but stella. Not some or most of the time- ALL the time
B003UMW69I|5.0|This is funny, fast, even moving. While the ending is predictable (what else could it be after all?) the way it's worked up is not. A feel good movie for sure, but there is also a moral of the story. I don't know if the author meant it, but for me it is: always keep an open mind on what life might bring to you from the most unexpected corners, and be ready to catch it on the fly.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I have read about 9 Jack Reacher stories and they are all consistently good.The way Lee Child portrays Reacher is conducive to<br />the life style Reacher has developed. However I suggest reading them in order. I did not and have found it a little confusing as to how disconnected from the capitalistic world he is and when.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  I loved it.  I am a software developer, a casual gamer, and was a teen during the 80s.  I feel like this book was custom written just for me.  I enjoyed it SO MUCH!  It was a great feel good novel with a wonderful mix of action, suspense, excellent characters, little brain teasers, and so much fun.  I could just go on and on.  If you ever loved programming or virtual reality or video/arcade games or the 80s, you will REALLY enjoy this book.  So glad I bought this!  Worth the $$!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was one of the books I couldn't put down.best book in the world you should read this book
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Always loved this game too! I can play it anytime I want and there are so many levels to play.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Purchased for a family member.  They are delighted with the DVDs.  Compactly presented and excellent price compared to competition pricing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is hard for me to play, its a really hard to do more then one suit! But I still like playing it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. it is perfect for girls who want their own horse but cant have  one . it also helps girls with horses learn to be more responsible
B00881VLCE|5.0|This one is fun for a little change of pace. You can decide how big you want that puzzle so you have lots of options.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was one of only three films that I saw in the movies last year and it was the only one that I thought was worth the money because I can't remember the other two!<br /><br />The story was great, the pacing (it kept me glued to my chair) was excellent, the jokes were great because they were natural and not forced and it was great to see some long forgotten video game characters again.  I will add this to my collection!
B0097UO87U|5.0|I have loved Jeff Lynne/ELO for years.  What a joy this CD was to obtain.  Why Jeff Lynne and ELO is not in the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame is one of the disgraces of the Hall.  This album is produced to a tee and is an example of the influence Lynne has had on so many others.  These aren't original songs though, they are the songs by other artists that have inspired Lynne over the years.  A great addition to any fan of ELO and Jeff Lynne.  Not a bad song on the CD and one I have listened to many times since purchasing it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I got this movie for a great price (10) bucks and I love all the characters in the movie. It's a really great little story and it's a cute take on how the monsters are scared of the humans.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I started watching Dr. Who again, after around a 30 year lay off because I needed something to watch while getting my workouts in in cardio.  It keeps my interest and is simply, one of the best television shows ever.  This rendition of the Doctor is great.  I am not so fond of his companion during the series, but in the end the show takes us to a place we didn't expect and the viewer has an appreciation for the story.  Each weeks story builds on the next and it truly is a very nice story line with many thought provoking events.  Highly recommended and well worth checking out.
B009FZFONO|5.0|When all you want to do is watch The Walking Dead. Seriously. Best show on television. If you like Breaking Bad and Weeds, then you'll like this show.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I got this movie after my daughter told me about a scene in which Channing Tatum dances to Ginuwine's \\"Pony\\". One word...WOW! This movie isn't all stripping it's a story of a guy trying to live his dream by stripping on the side & delves into the underbelly of the strip club world as well. I thoroughly enjoyed it & highly recommend it!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to use and fun. Year old daughter enjoys watching horse walk, eat, and neigh. Great game to pass time.
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|Seriously:<br /><br />Terrible acting.<br /><br />Bad cinematography.<br /><br />Bad CGI.<br /><br />Cheap locations (junkyards? long hikes?  come on)<br /><br />I can't think of a single saving grace for this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the visual layout makes this calculator a joy to use. I especially appreciate the large size buttons and large format output display.
0802473156|3.0|I have heard about this book for years and was excited to finally read it. I liked how the author explains how to show and express your feelings of love toward your spouse in a way he/she would understand and appreciate. It was insightful to how others receive actions toward them. It was a fast read and I'm glad I read it. That being said I didn't like how the author basically painted himself as the hero in every scenario and seems to pat himself on the back a lot for making the \\" discovery of the 5 love languages \\" and he didn't seem to feel so bad for throwing a cat against a wall haha. I'm a Christian and would've liked to see more glory going to God. Most of what the author \\" discovered \\" is in scripture its just not as easy to understand.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This was an interesting movie about A. Hitchcock, the man who directed the many epic, scarey thrillers.  Good to have a vision of this famous person.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This item does not work with kindlehd vs everything is upside down when u follow their instruction of holding at angle but as my wife bought it with good intentions it's only loss of 1 dollar.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|The special affects were awesome.  This version of Snow White matched with the special affects really transformed this well known tale into an adventure thriller.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very good story with enough twist to keep you guessing. This is one of the best King novels i have ever read.
B005Z28M58|5.0|I was sad to see this show end! I was happy to get the last season at least, and the box set was perfect!
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  I read all three of the books in less than a week.  Not much else got done.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been having fun being killed by a giant fast moving sloth.  The graphics are great.  The grandkids have gotten much further thru the game and really hav a kick playing.  I'm sure that with practice  I might live for 2 whole minutes.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great read couldn't put the book down love the detail thanks for sharing your adventure Cheryl. Hope to hike the trail soon
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a fun and colorful set of puzzles.  It has woken up my old brain.  I play it while waiting for things, like appointments, teenagers, and servicemen.  I recommend this game if you enjoy a good puzzle, and need practice touching a touch phone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I choose the four star rating, because the game is easy to understand and easy to play. I would recomend it to all
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all Vince Flynn's books, and this one is no different.  I would highly recommend Amazon.com to anyone, and would not hesitate to buy here again. Thank you.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille never fails to deliver a story full of humor,twists and turns. The only drawback is I read these books faster than he can write them!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I chose this rating because, this movie is a classic<br />love the characters because it's so real<br />I would recommendthis movie to all my friends
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read every book by Mr Connelly, and Harry is like an old and valued friend. I await the next episode.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|graphics are really good. lots of content and really engaging. it is definitely a good game and I cant seem to put it down.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Purchased this for my grandfather for Christmas and he loves it.  The picture quality is incredible and there is much footage included despite so few discs.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Annoyed it won't log in to my phone, get authentication errors. Other then that it has been good to me!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I think this is a great app. It has the weather, an alarm, and songs that you downloaded. The cons are that it cost 0.99 and that some times the weather is not correct. But over all it is a really good app.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Again do not submit again and again. Please please ck  ur records before sending to me again and again. Thx
B004JN1CW4|4.0|A nice ending to the series. After everything they endured from the maze to the headquarters of wicked, they got what they deserved.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Makes you think and its hard to put these ideas into actions.  Deffinately worth reading.
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|I wrote a review of this online back in 1999, with the old Royal Classics issue (still have 2 copies of that). Writing as the Inkpot Sibelius Nutcase, I said that it \\"is my top recommendation of the Seventh, and of the full cycle, bar none.\\" I have always recommended it. (With apologies when it went out of print.)<br /><br />Although I admit in more recent years I have not listened to many new recorded cycles to compare (and even some of the older ones) - there is absolutely no doubt in me that this is one of the finest interpretations of Sibelius's seven symphonies on record. Is there even a need to compare when you hear such natural performances, such organic playing? With these remastered reissues, the clarity of the sound and transparency of the orchestral lines took my breath away. It's better than ever now.<br /><br />Seventh Symphony: \\"Berglund's conducting is simply amazing - you can hear and FEEL him shaping the music - everything is so alive. Yes, occasionally I think the playing is a bit \\"raw\\" - but it comes across directly as an expression of the life-giving energy of this music. The orchestra never comes across as static, instead its strength and flow creates a sensation of oceans of undulating earth. Can you imagine a serene hymn of thunder and rolling clouds? Because that is exactly how the timpani roll at the final C-chord is like - all at once, light and darkness in fusion, a cosmic chorale where everything reaches universal equilibrium at total force, shaking with voluminous yet unified power, brazen brass upon tremoring basses, booming timpani, humming harmonies of winds, fields upon fields of silvery strings; the orchestral lines conjoin, swell and surge forward with enormous volume of purpose, fusing to reach the nirvana of C major.\\" (Please google Inkpot Sibelius Nutcase to find my original review).
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not my usual genre but my book club selected. Would recommend it to others. LIke the fast pace and interesting characters.
0385495323|5.0|If one of the following describes you, you should buy this book:<br />1. You are interested in cryptography.<br />2. You are in a class that teaches cryptography, and you find it dry and dull.<br />3. You enjoy doing the cryptoquip in the newspaper.<br /><br />If none of the above apply to you, then you're on your own in this decision.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|I tried this and must say it's not what we thought it would be. We wanted to do some simple recording of songs (acoustic), but could not even figure out how to get it to record. The instructions are not correct.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read review on slate.com of both the book and the self publishing model used by the author. Intruded, I  bought the book and enjoyed it. About 1/2 through the book, the Wall Street Journal did an article, more on the author's method of getting the book out. I think S&S was smart to grab the physical only rights because this author has found a model and is going to make it work.<br /><br />P.S. Loved the book, the plot twists and very good writing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The photos are often amazing. I even found a recipe for homemade donuts on the site. Mostly of course it's the photography that keeps me interested in using this app. A great way to stay busy while commercials are on TV, by the way. I post my faves to facebook (repin them) and later go back to them to find inspiration.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You can't go wrong with a family drama based on history and educational dramas. The writer and actors are phenomenal.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|Takes you back to the front porches of the shotgun houses in the Mississippi Delta. Simple, soul breaking blues that makes you feel the pain of the singer/guitarist. One of the best efforts in the genre in years.
0920668372|5.0|This book is a legend, it's touching, cute, and a great way to teach a child to read. My child even made up a tune to the &#34;song&#34; mentioned in the book. SUper cute. Should be a part of everyone's collection.
B006HL9G10|4.0|I own actual Tibetan singing bowls and this app actually sounds just like they do. Great meditation and time out tool.
B0035JRVBO|2.0|Maybe I was supposed to get the joke....that there would not really be chocolates included in this box, but that's why I bought this for a Valentine's day present. It wasn't the present I'd expected and I wasn't satisfied giving a present that had &#34;pictures&#34; of chocolate inside, nothing else.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I got this grindhouse pick for a friend, and he is enjoying it immensely. I will likely get copies for myself at some point...what was I thinking?
B008K8VDPU|4.0|My son begs me to play this every day.  We like to run our fingers across the keys or push a lot of keys at one time and then watch the computer catch up!  He tries all of the different instruments.
B0049985XW|5.0|This arrived yesterday and was an enjoyable addition to my Bogie collection.  The only part that remains a mystery is that Bogie never received so much as a nomination for his role, but the flat and uninteresting son of the director was handed accolades for his deadpan performance and virtual silence through the entire film.  Answer? nepotism, absolute nepotism.  Bogie must have been pissed off, at the very least frustrated.
B000002H1T|5.0|The Cars is one of the most successful American rock bands which formed the part of 80s music. They are often recognized as a new wave band such as Human League, Men Without Hats, Blondie, The Knack, Duran Duran and so on. Their music is also enjoyable to music fans who love Foreigner, Journey, Toto, Styx, and Mr. Mister. The secret of their versatility and crossover appeal to music fan can be found in their two different type of lead singers, Ric Ocasik which perfectly gives what synth pop fans want and Benjamin Orr who can sing high-toned rock tracks like \\"JUST WHAT I NEEDED\\" , \\"LET'S GO\\".<br /><br />In their 1984 fifth album HEARTBEAT CITY, Ric Ocasik did most of the hit-charting tracks such as HELLO AGAIN, MAGIC, YOU MIGHT THINK, WHY CAN'T I HAVE YOU while Benjamin Orr did hit ballad DRIVE, and rock tracks STRANGER EYES, IT'S NOT THE NIGHT.<br />Overall the album is really enjoyable to casual 80s music fans who love Top 40 hit songs. The album also put out a number of great video clips which are still talked about in 80s forums.<br /><br />Verdict: Mid 80s phenomenal album<br />Rating: 96 out of 100<br />Recommended for: New wave music fans as well as 80s pop rock fans in general
B009E9R1IM|5.0|It's always good to have the additional full size material that goes with LP Records......Sound quality is good for 2 channel and I enjoy the nostalgic experience of vinyl.....
B002MQYOFW|4.0|As a middle aged adult I didn't think this was for me but decided to give it a try.  The story is riveting and well-paced...a good book for a little escapism.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Could not watch the movie since the video player kept crashing in chrome.<br />No possibility of a refund. So for now I will stick to youtube.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Just what I was expecting. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a little long in parts, but character development is paramount. And there's a lot of characters. Stunning visuals. Great action. Touching story. I'm looking forward to the next two installments!<br />Sit back. Relax and enjoy!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|My kids play a lot of games on my Kindle Fire but all I ever play is Solitaire and I was getting bored with that. This app was in my recommendations so I downloaded it. I always thought mahjong was a really hard game but the rules are very simple. That doesn't mean it's always easy and beating the clock is very hard. I love the music...it's very soothing when played at low volume. My only complaint is that a few of the levels have the tiles arranged in a way that they're too small for me to comfortably see them and you can't rotate the game. You can make the tiles bigger but then you have to shift between the top and bottom. There are enough levels however for this to not really bother me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much it feels like I'm really there.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a great show...addicted! I love the interaction between the staff and family. There is such heartache, but it was very typical of the era.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Easy to use application.  I love it.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I like the large buttons.  I have nothing else to say Amazon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could hardly put it down.  It definitely was worth the loss of sleep.  I would suggest this trilogy to anyone that enjoys love and romance with sex thrown into the mix.
0785151303|5.0|I have 4 volumes in Marvel's \\"Art of\\" series. All have excellent paper quality and great photography. The seroes case covers and books are all exceptional - a beautiful gift or fantastic library addition for any fan of Thor, Marvel, or the Avengers.  \\"The Art of Thor\\" is my favorite so far. Particularly interesting are Chris Hemsworth's pictures in costume - he might not be the actual Norse God, but he should be!!!!!
B007G5O3K0|5.0|An excellent CD that will please most Harket and a-ha followers and could generate some new fans if they have a chance to hear it. There are no lame tracks on this release. Harket has abundant opportunities to express his remarkable vocal range. The music varies from acoustic guitar, piano and violins to synthesizers and techno pop. This CD is remarkable for its collaborative assembly of lyric writers, music composers and instrumental and electronic musicians and arrangers. Of the ten tracks, on four of them Harket collaborates with others on the lyrics and music, on one with the music only and on one with the lyrics only.<br /><br />The track with the most universal appeal is the first, \\"Scared of Heights,\\" a beautiful ballad with music and lyrics by Norwegian Espen Lind. The most melodic and upbeat is \\"I'm the One.\\" \\"Lightning\\" is a melancholy/romantic showpiece. \\"Quiet\\" is a pretty acoustic, low tempo love ballad. \\"When I Reached the Moon\\" is a slow raunchy synthesized number. \\"Keep the Sun Away\\" pairs Harket's distinctive mellow-to-high voice with a pounding digital accompaniment reminiscent of Alphaville. At least half the tracks on this CD are excellent for rhythmic dancing or exercise. After two or three plays I found all of these tunes at least very likable, if not lovable. Too bad none of them will get North American air play except on eclectic low wattage stations.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|first of all I love Nicholas Sparks books! Loved the movie Notebook so I knew I was gonna like to read Safe Haven. I read it before the movie came out. I have not seen the movie yet, but people have told me that the movie pretty much follows the book.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read the book after seeing the movie that I loved. Thisi is the first time I liked a movie more that the book. I still like the book but it was so different.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works great!!!! I like it because it keeps my kindle charged better than the cable that came with it originally.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it epic better than a pig. it just so fun. Some people think its boring but its epic. its the best game ever.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Would highly recommend reading the Stieg Larsson series. It was a good read. The books kept your interest along the way.
B005LAII80|4.0|Karl Urban did a great job with the Dredd character.  The Lena Headey character was also deliciously evil  The 3D was well done, and worked as well on my TV as it did in the theater.  I'd give it 4.5 stars but Amazon won't let me do that.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book was a lot better than the movie! Would recommend the read. Far better story than the movie that was made.
B009AMAJPA|3.0|This movie is flawed but it's also good. There is action but it's more of a character driven romance than crime thriller. Farrell and Rapace are great together and it's their respective story that makes this worth seeing. It tries to be film noir but misses the mark. With more deft direction and a tighter script, it could have been great. Worth renting but no need to bump it up in your queue or rush out to the red box when it gets released but it's good enough that I will end up buyng it eventually.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|At $30 this set is reasonably priced.  It's a collectors' set, so you have to be into Minecraft to really appreciate it, but my kids love it.  They've had fun putting the world together and then of course bringing in the creeper (complete with sound effects) to blow it up.  If you like legos and you like Minecraft, then this is a great buy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Being a major choir glee growing up, this was right up my ally. So funny and the singing was great!
B005QUQP76|4.0|I'm a first time user for these type of mouses and this one is fantastic.  The sniper button to help me steady my aim when I'm sniping is just awesome. Great feel to the mouse, sexy look to it and does not feel cheap in any way. My favorite feature is sensitivity buttons in the middle of the mouse.  Helps a great deal when I'm playing games like FarCry 3 or Borderlands 2. Only reason why I'm not going it 5 stars is because it doesn't come with any type of readme file or documentation to help you program the mouse buttons and it can be pretty frustrating to figure out.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Good radar coverage of all areas showing storm movement and coverage. Display is well laid out for easy reading. Sale price made the difference...had been using the free version.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|I read the 3 main books but never got around to reading The Hobbit.  This movie felt really drawn out and I was left feeling unimpressed even in comparison to the first 3 movies.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|so do you have a lot time on your hands? You sit and do a lot of tapping to get coins and other stuff.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Definitely does the franchise justice.  Well scripted,  great acting, and provides a solid foundation to the characters.  It was really fun to see prof X and magneto's development.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|The game has 5 game levels:<br />Level 1: Count the items on screen, 1-5.<br />Level 2: Different items on the screen, you have to count the number of given items. For example, there may be 3 watermelons and 2 apples, but it will say \\"Count the watermelons\\"<br />Level 3: It will give you 6 food items, and such as 6 lemons, and say \\"Please eat 2 lemons\\". So you would click on 2 lemons and then click done.<br />Level 4: 12 items on the screen, it counts up to the number 10.<br />Level 5: Time limit! 1 minute. Go as fast as you can and see how many items you can count.<br /><br />The app is good for teachers and parents to help their children learn more about both counting and food types. I've encountered over 10 different foods, so there is a variety of foods. It seems geared towards pre-school/kindergarten, and would be good for any teachers who may have access to one-on-one instruction with tablets in special ed classrooms.<br /><br />The main problem I have is repetition. It would be nice to have some mini games to mix up the counting, or some animated screens/videos with \\"Great job!\\" with graphics that kids love to see. I think that would have helped kids attention be retained longer. It is a professionally done app however (but it seems maybe too professional, it has to connect with the children!), and could be a good tool to try for children who are working on/need help with counting. For free, give it a try, $2.99 seems too expensive for this app, unless you are really looking for a counting app.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really recommend this game it is fantastic!!!! I really have nothing bad to say about this app. If you are an animal lover like me you are sure to love this game.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|The game is mindless, really. A great way to kill a few minutes at the airport, etc. What I really loathe about this game, however, are the &#34;Obama will pay for your house! Click here to learn how!&#34; ads that appear at the bottom. Makes my blood boil.<br /><br />That is what is wrong with this country.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|just finished the game. now I plan to go back and improve some of my scores! playing it on my galaxy 3 drains the battery pretty quick. the game was loads of fun and never boring! if u like match 3 games u have to give this one a try!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this app!!!! &lt;3 :) Everyone who has a kindle of any kind should download it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well-written, thought provoking novel that keeps your attention to the last pages of the book.  Landay's 1st person style brings the reader into the thoughts and conflicts of the main characters.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very interesting!!! It gives you a great insight to what really happens during times of wars. would recommend it to anyone.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book held my attention from the very beginning!  The characters were so well developed,  I felt like I knew them all.  I highly recommend this novel~
B006FE83UE|5.0|I really enjoyed this classic movie.  I am a fan of old favorite movies. I would recommend it to others
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book. Reading Catching Fire now and can't wait to see what Mockingjay has in store.  Read the trilogy you won't be disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I, like many others am hooked on this series.  It maintains the wonderful cast, writing and story.  If you enjoyed the first season, by all means watch this one.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie as they really hyped it.  Didn't like it that much a waste of money.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|I hadn't heard of this band until I was searching on youtube for new music and came across the song Abandon off this record. I really liked it so I listened to the rest of the record which seemed to become a ritual because since that day I've listened to this record every day at least once a day. Since there is already a track by track review I've decided just to say ramble on about how awesome this record is with its' powerful riffs, great vocals, pounding drums, and it's interesting lyrics. I've never been quite so enthralled with a power metal band, I've always leaned more towards just heavy metal and at times metalcore and melodic metalcore. I am an advanced guitar player and vocalist so my expertise are in those two subjects so those are the two places I'm most critical of. I find both those subject areas surpass excellance, point stated. My favorite tracks are Unbreakable, Stand Your Ground, and Dragons. The rest of the songs are incredible but those stand out in particular. Get this record, I highly recommend it!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Even though I knew the ending I was at the edge of my seat through the entire movie.  I loved it - best movie I have seen in a long time.  Ben Afflect did a great job both as a actor and director.
0345537998|5.0|Lighthearted, humorous reactions to serious plot lines, you have to root for Tuf and his rational yet eccentric approach to his problems.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This film was Kenny Everett's favourite film. &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; works on so many levels. It's a classic black and white movie with actors and a director from a classic age. It's a great old-fashioned homespun yarn, full of warm apple-pie humour, with a clever but simple dramatic twist that reflects eternal values. It's a tragi-comedy told in a small town setting, but which takes on all the gravitas of an epic moral tale with a profound spiritual truth. It's guaranteed to produce tears, as the value of a life - and life - is beautifully celebrated in an unexpected way. No wonder many people consider this to be their favourite film of all time.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I was really moved by this documentary.  Since moving to the Napa  Valley, organic and local has been much more a part of my regular shopping.  Now it will be even more so.  I shared the link with my social media family as well.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have the AccuWeather app on my IPad, so I thought I'd get the one for my Kindle too. I'm glad I did. It's a great tool.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Love this cable.  It charges the Nexus 10 much faster and frees up the usb port.  Also, it is magnetic so it quickly disconnects in case you trip on it.<br /><br />It's a must have for a N10 user.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Flight scenes ridiculous but story of addiction is interesting. Good acting throughout. Worth it on demand, not at theater prices.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I find this game very entertaining. Keep up the good work with all of your possible future games and endeavors, you beautiful person
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is just an okay app...nothing to keep you wanting to go back to it. To the cloud it went.
B000NY12LO|5.0|It is sadly ironic that life immitated art in the Connecticut school shooting. The author made all the character's genuine. She even made me feel empathy towards the shooter (in the novel).
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This delightful story was as expected.  A bit formulaic for my taste.  The story follows a predictable path.  No surprises in this book still a great read
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I like the story-line but not knowing French, I couldn't read the parts that appear in that language.  Furthermore, some of Hugo's dissertations on various aspects of the political and religious systems of that epoch were somewhat tedious. If you are not adversed to lengthy sentences, it's a good read.  Sometimes, however, the sentences were filled with so many clauses that the average reader could easily find hmself losing the thought.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|It was ok, there are so many of these movies now, they all seem the same. I like the actors so that made it worth watching for me.
B00BLGY8X2|5.0|Be prepared for something interesting and entertaining. I want to watch it again already. I would compare this style of film to Terry Gilliam, so if you like his work you will like this one - very surreal, artsy, thought provoking.  You cannot predict a thing, in fact it will leave you wanting discussion. I would suggest not reading a thing about it and going in blind - it will be a delightful surprise - even some musical interludes included are great and unexpected.
B00B1ME11U|5.0|Clutch fans come to the band from many angles, and it's worth saying up front that I came to them originally as a metal and hardcore fan.  So for me, the couple moments on this album when the band rocks back on blues \\"cliches\\" are a bit of a lull, but there is far less of that influence and flow than on the two previous albums, so I'm an exquisitely happy Clutch fan.<br /><br />This album rocks beginning, middle, and end.  And I mean middle.  Though \\"Gone Cold\\" is a slower, atmostpheric blues-inspired piece, it has the same authenticity and grit as Regulator and Ghost on Blast Tyrant.  There's musical, if not metric, tonnage of riffology here, just as Fallon is in top form as a sort of schizophrenic prophet of pop culture and apocalypse.<br /><br />The record never stops moving.  It is relentless, and what's better than that for any fan of any brand of rock n' roll.<br /><br />So, while part of me wishes they'd make a new foray into the courageous countryside of Elephant Riders or the raw and open land of Transnational, I love when Clutch is being Clutch.  Here it is right here, folks.  With the exception of those couple of blues cliches (Book, Saddle, and Go being a prime one), this album will keep you guessing as much as it will keep you rocking.<br /><br />It's anthemic, aggressive, sure of itself, and unrelenting.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We saw this opening day IMAX on Christmas day 2012 and it was spectacular. As someone who has seen the original cast on Broadway (NY) as well as a revival in L.A. a year ago, I must say this was the most exciting production I've ever seen. The added music was seamless. All the actors were wonderful, even Russell Crowe though his vocals were so-so added so much due to his acting you don't feel gypped. I bought this blu-ray set because I knew I wanted to own and watch it again.
B004811PMO|5.0|this is the most fantastic musical movie I've ever seen. I love this movie Oklahoma and it's really a true depiction and wonderful depiction of American Life back in the early 19 hundreds.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This film was well made and the style is very entertaining as a scary thrill ride. There are a few scenes that will make you really jump.  It isn't heavy on gore as so many are these days but just a nice scary story and is creepy and cool enough to keep you engaged. I liked it and would recommend.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Awesome, every one should read this, a great book for married couples and for those who will get married. A great present for weddings
B00AVTMCYW|3.0|I would recommend this movie although not blown away by it.  It's a coming of age and sort of this generation's Breakfast Club. The one thing that I do love in this is the actor Ezra Miller, a breakout star that is worth seeing this film for. Ezra was stunning in We Need to Talk about Kevin which is a must see.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was looking for something to get me through the rest of winter.  Insanity and P90X were just way to expensive.  This is a perfect &#34;over your lunchtime&#34; workout.  I highly recommend this DVD to people who are new to working out or workout regularly and just need something different.
B0030BOCF0|5.0|We received it promptly and the record was well packed.<br />The difference in transparency of the vinyl sound compared with the CD is astonishing and reveals subtle details that are inaudible on the CD.<br />Well worth purchasing.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Such a good movie.  Deserved all of the awards it received this year at the award shows.  Ben did an awesome job.  Would watch again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love temple run and can't get enough of it.  They are teaching me the game and using all my devices to play.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|I have been trying to get caught up on the Potter Series.  Of course another stellar movie and now if they only release Part 2 on Amazon!
B0084670FU|5.0|A little difficult to follow at first, then it grabs you with the various lifestyles of the characters involved. The movie never did answer my question of &#34;Why would anyone want to vacation in the hot, dirty, dusty, windy, waterless desert?&#34;
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was presently surprised how good this movie was. This was a clean movie, no dirty scenes, no foul language really, and it had a real good story to go with it. The acting in this was done well. The singing was done well, and the director managed to take a decent story, and mix it up with humor also, which this movie did keep you laughing throughout.  &#34;Fat Amy&#34; was my favorite character. This will not be a movie for those who are out for hard core action and suspense, but if your out to enjoy a decent story, and have some good laughs along the way, then this movie is worth every penny.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I would not have selected this book without some recommendations from friends. Glad I did, it was a joy to read.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I got this game for free and I am glad. I downloaded it because of the great reviews it had. its ok. its not bad. but its definitely not worth $5. I guess I was expecting a lot more for the list price.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Purchased the product for a present. The receipient loved the CD. As I wrote, I purchased this product as a present. it came i na timely manner..  great job guys.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I can see why this was the best movie and got the oscar.  The disc was clear. ; Just wish there were no previews.
B0099KJFJ4|5.0|The movie had an interesting plot with Van Damme as the teacher of the person who goes about and gets revenge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A lot of Nicholas Sparks books are basically the same, boy meets girl, etc..  But this story had so much more to it.  I really loved it and found it hard to put down,  I am excited about seeing the movie as soon as I get the chance.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|An overall excellent film. Denzel Washington accurately and realistically portrays an addict who happens to be an airline pilot. Well done. A most enjoyable entertainment experience.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the first season and wasn't disappointed by the second. Acting, plot, pace...all if it was amazing. You care about the characters and their foibles. Not everyone is perfect but no one is completely evil.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|But overall they asked what are those video games with money?  No ida what an arcade is, so something was lost in the movie.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|If you're a fan of the foo fighters, this album will make you really happy. Most of their biggest hits are on here.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|we liked the game, but it was difficult to go with the rules. We had to make up several just to make the game flow. All in all, it is fun, and hopefully will be better used as my kids age (currently 7).
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I always had held a high respect for our military troops, and have 3 sons serving myself, but my respect and admiration have gone even higher.  Mark really gets you to visualize what kind of person it takes to make it through the training to become a part of the Special Forces.  He shares a heart breaking story that proves what kind of character, strength, and dedication our military heroes have, and to what lengths they will go to finish the mission, and protect our country, and one another.  If i could give it more stars i would.
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|I was expecting the wonderful costumes and acting.  I was not expecting how unusual and unique artistic movie this would be.  My wife and I very much enjoyed this famous love story.
B004LGS2M2|5.0|When a classic book makes you laugh out loud, what's not to love?  Sharp-witted, insightful parody with a delicate touch.  No mystery why this one *is* a classic!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Love this CD !!!!!  Phillip Phillips is very talented ..... i will buy more of his CD's and love to listen to him on my long commute to work in the mornings.
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|Amazing Movie you will be blessed The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. -Psalm 34:18<br /><br />Oh.wow! This video is really﻿ good ....guys!!! Thank you so much for the blessing you all are to so many Jews (and Gentiles) around the world.<br />  it's  beautifully, sent chills through me...
B004X75RK4|3.0|I didn't like the quality of video. It would be great if Amazon could improve on the video quality and video interface as well.
1451695195|1.0|Dr. Alexanders journey reads more like The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which is a guide for souls on their journey between lives. In the book he never  even describes a place that sounds anything like the Christian version of  heaven and he offers no proof that there is an eternal heaven. His journey bounces between lower planes and higher planes of consciousness.  You can read The Tibetan Book of the Dead for free here:  [...]  And a similar free book, The The Psychedelic Experience here: [...]  There is no heaven as imagined by Christians. When asked who would a women who had 7 husbands be with in heaven Jesus replied their would be no spouses in heaven.  Luke 20:27-40 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. 28 \\"Teacher,\\" they said, \\"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. 29 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. 30 The second 31 and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. 32 Finally, the woman died too. 33 Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\\" 34 Jesus replied, \\"The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. 35 But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, 36 and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels.
0060887311|4.0|This series is a great little read for young teenage girls interesting and exciting but not too risque! My daughter actually read book number 5 first and liked it so much she wanted to go back and read the whole series from the start.  That says something because she hates reading!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The movie was great!  Lots of suspense and even though I already knew the story it was still a nail-bitter.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Everything I expected it to be a great deal and an awesome show I would recommend it to anyone 18 +
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The sequel just was ok.  I love Daniel Craig but the story seemed a little weak and the villian was revealed too early.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great book. Kept me wanting to read more of the journey that lied ahead. I learned a lot and we all should pursue our \\"personal legend\\".
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|We listened (absorbed) this CD into our very beings last night. This is an awesome CD. We highly recommend Leonard Cohen to everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm 14. I've read almost half of his books. Love love love!!!! This is my favorite book so far I've read!
B00BSBY38A|3.0|It didn't live up to the hype. Visuals were great but the story was lacking. wouldn't recommend it to friends.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I can understand that this trilogy was such a hit. The first book was a bit like all romances and too much sex but from the second book the story was really good and I enjoyed it very much. You can see the change in the carathers and feel the love that they have for each other. The book was one that stays with you and I have been comparing other books with this book and unfortunately cant find such a good story. I cant wait to read more books from this author!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This is a suspenseful book. Towards the end, I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read another Harry Bosch novel.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The story is great. It doesn't have the games in it! It is called the hunger games. Come on. Every thing else was great.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is a sad story, but I still liked the book a lot. It's a story well told in a way that makes you want to keep reading to the end. This was my first book by Jodi Picoult, and I'll definitely read another one of hers soon.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app for relaxation.  Not quite as good as Sound Sleep, but certainly worth a look, especially since many people's personal preferences vary greatly.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was very insightful especially with the events that have occurred in the news recently.  Bullying and school violence that seemed to be interrelated.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Great feature set, detailed forecast information, and the hour by hour conditions is a nice touch.  Much quicker to load than the Weather Channel app.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|Very good for people who have used drawing programs before. Some tools are hard to use, but it is over all a very god program.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this app daily to keep up with various talk and news programs during the workday when I can't be near a radio.  Also great for catching up on local news and information on different locales.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Not a fan of Adam Sandler at all, but this movie was cute and funny and my children loved it.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Great little app!  Accurate and wonderful for anyone who enjoys looking up at the night sky.  Simple to use, doesn't require any odd permissions, great job by the developer.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Can't wait to read this book-I really enjoyed the movie. So glad to be able to read it on my Kindle
B00BQEFM6Q|5.0|I was introduced to Phildel's music through a friend and since then I've been eagerly waiting for this release. I haven't been this excited by a collection of music in a long time and I haven't been floored like this in recent memory. I love everything about this album - every track on the album. There are no skip-tracks on this one!<br /><br />Now how to describe it? That's the tough part. Phildel transcends all genres, which I LOVE. It's completely unique and interesting without being odd or different for the sake of being odd and different. The music is orchestral, cinematic and electronic with keyboards and pianos sprinkled throughout. With everything tied together by her lovely voice which is both lilting and haunting. At times she evokes a Billie Holiday-esque vibe in her lower register and the music seems to borrow some jazz-like elements for a couple of songs - but only slightly. This isn't jazz, it's not pop, it's not electronica. It's wholly original. The songs seem to be built on a base of piano and keyboards with electronics, drums and layered vocals. There is a very expansive and cinematic feel to the music. It's emotional and evokes a sense of something mystical and magical.<br /><br />There have been some amazing women musicians coming out of the UK lately: Imogen Heap, Ellie Goulding, and Marina and the Diamonds to name a few. Phildel fits comfortably amongst those women, and there are some similarities. Indeed, if you are fans of any of those women, Phildel will very likely be your cup of tea.<br /><br />If you're not sure based on the samples here, check her out on YouTube. She has released beautiful videos for a number of songs off this release and they add a fantastic visual accompaniment to the songs. I'm certain that if you're a fan of female vocals and unique ethereal electronics/piano, you'll love Phildel. I know this will be one of my top releases of 2013.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Who does not love the Bible?  The best stories, the best advice, and the best news of all -  Jesus Christ.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have had this game on every form of media I own and still love it. Was so happy to find it for my tablet. I share my love of this game with everyone.  Its nice that its not just a jewels game, but also has a nice storyline. Thumbs up!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The cast is superb, the story is fascinating, the production is first class!  Downton Abbey is a must see for everyone!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The first episode..I wasn't at all sure I would like it.  Then when the second show got going it kind of clicked.  Great effects.  A little gritty around the edges.  You don't see the technology behind the assumptions but it works.  What the hell kind of guns are those?<br /><br />Pretty good character development.  If there were another season, I'd watch.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|During spring break, I played this movie for four kids.  They were all bored for the first 30 - 45 mins.  Near the end, they were more into it......  They wanted to know the outcome.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|I would have given it 2.5 stars.<br /><br />If you're like me, you were probably really excited to hear that Suarez was coming out with a new book.  His first two novels, \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Freedom\\" were top notch tech thrillers that I read really quickly; I just couldn't put them down.  When I heard that he had a new book coming, I was really excited.<br /><br />Well, I finally got around to reading it, and I must say that I'm disappointed.  Was it a bad book?  No.  Was it a smartly written book?  You could say that.  Was it compelling?  Not really.  I recall blowing through \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Freedom\\" in a day or so each.  It took me about two weeks or so to read this one.  I'd pick it up, read it a bit, put it down and repeat the cycle.  It just was not the page turner that the previous two were and couldn't hold my attention for very long.  I think part of the problem was just that I didn't care all that much about the characters.  On top of that, it was not a very focused novel.  It kind of meandered.<br /><br />The characters.  Odin and McKinney were the male and female protagonists in this one.  Neither one was really worth carrying about.  Odin was the black ops guy who had no personality and was fairly one-dimensional and dull; we knew he was looking to get to the bottom of the drone attacks at all costs and that's about it.  McKinney was this anti-war, anti-military pacifist who was annoying and just not a character who I really cared for.  These two characters were backed back a number of supporting characters whose codenames were more interesting than they were.  You know you're in trouble when two of the most interesting characters in the book are actually not even human.  They are two ravens.<br /><br />The book basically addressed idea of autonomous drones and a frightening reality if these things are misused.  This is current day stuff and how it was presented here was not entirely implausible; it just wasn't very compelling.  Honestly, Michael Crichton(RIP) would have probably done a better job with this subject matter.<br /><br />It's just too bad this topic could not have been presented in a more compelling way.  This book reads like something he wrote prior to \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Freedom\\" that perhaps he dusted off, polished up, and released.  I may actually reread those first two books.  \\"Kill Decision\\" is a \\"One and Done.\\"  In other words, I'll likely never read it again.<br /><br />Not trying to discourage anyone from reading it, just don't go into expect to be enthralled like you may have been with his first two books.ould have probably done a better job with this subject matter.<br /><br />It's just too bad this topic could not have been presented in a more compelling way.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the format of the book. Reading as Nick, then as Amy. Almost like reading two books in one. If you think your love life is crazy, read this book. You will feel a little better....but not Amazing.
B000IZ6URY|1.0|I'm suprised this movie was ever made.<br /><br />What a waste of the worlds resources and people's time.<br /><br />Don't bother. It shouldn't have even made it on Amazon.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is better than temple run even though they took the idea from them i still like it and whats up with the bunny
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was great!!  I couldn't put it down.  It was an all consuming love story.  Loved Travis and loved Abby.  Can't wait for Travis' point of view in the next book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you have the first two books this is a must read. The first two books are 5 stars this is a 4 star. It moves a little slower and the antisipation of what's comming next didn't hold me. I loved the series and this was a good (not great) way to close the storyline.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I love Jack Reacher, sad but true, to whom there is no comparison.<br />Exciting story, a good look at where and how it all began.<br />Have read all of the Jack Reacher series and thoroughly enjoyed them all.<br />Would recommend to anyone who enjoys action packed yarns.<br />I hope Lee Child will manage to write some more.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read this book  4 times and still never get bored with it, still gives me chills. Hope she writes more
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A lot of fun<br />Really Interactive with a lot of different tasks and things to do. Always running out of energy and could spend a lot of money to keep it up
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I love all of the Playrix games and would own all of them except for the timers.<br />I like the option of Casual, no clock, that other games have which is why I bought<br />Them and none of the Playrix.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|What a cute book; nice light read with insights on how to handle life's curve balls.  Even if you're not a dog lover, the narrator will capture your heart.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I've been collecting classical records for roughly the past 68 years so you can imagine the number of Rachmaninoff<br />concerto recordings I already have. From the standpoint of recording quality and performance this set is the absolute best!! Valentina has all the power needed for these but she also has the musicianship. The orchestra and conductor<br />match her excellence. The Amazon price is very reasonable so why hesitate? Buy it!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I read the books before watching the show, but it just makes the Geoerge RR Martin world better. Characters are spot on, and they keep true tot he book's story line (mostly).<br /><br />Love it!!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|With a mix of humor, drama, violence, and philosophy, Joss Whedon's space cowboy masterpiece stands up to repeated viewing. An absolute classic.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|Woodkid's highly anticipated debut full-length album The Golden Age is a masterpiece of words and beautifully arranged and composed music infused with bombastic theatricality. If you're craving well-written music that stirs something in you and is full of genuine emotion as well as excellent storytelling, look no further.<br /><br />While I am completely and utterly in love with the entire album some specific highlights of the album (to me) are \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"Stabat Mater\\", and \\"Run Boy Run\\".
B007SAKSF2|5.0|There is so much great music in this box set. A must for any Blur fan regardless if you have all the albums already. Loved that it comes with a digital copy that makes it easier to transfer to my iPod. Packaging is really cool. The only thing that might be a complaint is that the box is kinda big
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy playing this game.  I keep my kindle by my bedside and when I can't sleep I play this game.  Easy and lots of fun!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is such an entertaining movie from beginning to end. I have watched it 3 times and laughed really hard every time. I really hope they do a sequel
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked the little bit of mystery in the story along with the presence of Jo.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Great story and great acting. They did the book proud. I've seen this multiple times and can't wait to watch again.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This is the first Corey book & having read the others, this one is just as good as I remembered. Great characters & good story. Be sure to read the rest of this character's books!
B00513HXE2|4.0|Kept wanting to read it every night.  Enjoyed the plot.  Intriguing.  No complaints.  I thought Darth Plagueis was a little better.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  It has it all!  I'd recommend it highly.
B009X01C64|4.0|As mentioned in the title, a lot of thought was used in creating this quality case.  The fact that you can rotate from portrait to landscape without having to jump through hoops is a plus.  I also enjoy that it works fine whether it is rotated to the charge position or not, so closing the case and going to standby is not an issue if you forget to rotate it to the original position.  Protects the Kindle well, although somewhat bulky (but Necessary).  There should be no reason to take the Kindle out of the case, but if so, it comes out easily \\"if\\" you follow the simple instructions.  It would seem using your Kindle without a case of this type would be a step in the wrong direction.
B009TO99TG|5.0|This was a great deal to get the first 4 Coldplay CDs in one package. I was very happy with this purchase!!!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time!  It's the kind of movie that stays with you, if you know what I mean.  Ethan Hawke does a great job but this is definitely a psychological thriller with a very disturbing ending!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Having the dog offering his point of view was the most successful part of the story, I loved his take on things and wanted more of his dog insight into his human family. But the story was hard and not enjoyable and not the kind of suffering and anguish that made you rally around the characters, it was the kind that made you just plain sad. I liked reading this book but I did not love it, I do not even look back on it fondly.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|This is a movie that definitely exceeded my expectations!  Jennifer Lawrence and Elizabeth Shue make a very believable mother/daughter in this thriller that will surely surprise you
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It wasn't the best game I've ever played but it was definitely the second. It has amazing graphics, and a good story line. If you liked this game you should try of the big fish puppet man mysteries.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|One of the best actors EVER, Denzel Washington delivers another amazing performance.  If you haven't seen the trailer, this movie is not what you think it is.  One of the best movies to come out in quite some time
0802473164|3.0|I think this is a cut and past copy of the original 5 Love Languages that was not edited well to translate the language over exclusively to men.  Buy the original.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This may be fun at first. but it gets boring as a wobbly gobbly thing. The only objective is to get a fat alien
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I bought this because I had seen the movie (The Golden Compass) and I was interested in the rest of the series. It's different than the movie...but once I adjusted I had a blast reading them.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This wobbly gobbly nic nac of an app is very useful for minecraft, it's very useful. You can change from survival to creative and give yourself some stuff that isn't even in the game
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Bought it because I thought my friend was going to &#34;make&#34; me see the movie and I wanted to compare...still haven't seen the movie...and I don't think i'm upset about it. Book 1 is by far the best of the three. If you only want to know what all the hype is about I would suggest just getting that and leaving the other two out of it.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|I have a few of the Playrix Android apps which work just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  This one says it isn't compatible.  Can't find anything online about it being a Kindle exclusive.  Please fix this to work on multiple devices.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Some parts *coughbookfourcough* were a bit of a struggle to get through (but that's because not many of the characters I personally care about are in that one) but it's definitely awesomely amazing.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|If you like action you will like the new James Bond movie! I think it maybe the best 007 movie yet!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|its is a really awsome game. its multiplayer which is great and you get to be who you want. it is like world of warcraft (if you have played it).
B009UNGYHG|5.0|My husband really likes this case.  It's just the right size for his pocket and helps to keep his bluetooth out of the dirt and dust when working. Great for being away from home when you aren't near an outlet to charge from.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Greatest movie EVER!!! great for kids and family. shipped promptly and was hilarious. very happy with this purchase and the price was right.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|I bought the cd for my wife.She was thrilled. My grand kids even liked it because they had seen the video.It gets a thumbs up.
0812993357|5.0|I gifted this  book to a friend and she raves about it, so that makes me extremely happy and Grace is an icon!
1416960953|5.0|My eight-year-old recently watched [[ASIN:B001AF7QVU The Spiderwick Chronicles]] and enjoyed it so much that I decided to get this field guide which contains descriptions of the various inhabitants of the Invisible World. The book itself is a large hardcover which has the appearance of a beautiful antique journal. Within the book, the creatures are categorized under:<br /><br />Around the House and Yard<br />Brownies<br />Boggarts<br />Changelings<br />Pixies<br />Salamanders<br />Stray Sod<br /><br />In Fields and Forests<br />Cockatrices<br />Elves<br />Leprechauns<br />Manticores<br />Sprites<br />Treefolk<br />Unicorns<br /><br />In Lakes, Streams, and the Sea<br />Kelpies<br />Merfolk<br />Nixies<br />Seas Serpents<br />Trolls<br /><br />In the Hills and Mountains<br />Dwarves<br />Giants<br />Goblins<br />Hobgoblins<br />Knockers<br />Ogres<br /><br />In the Sky<br />Dragons<br />GriffinsPhoenixes<br /><br />Outside at Night<br />Banshees<br />Gargoyles<br />Phookas<br />Will-o'-the-Wisps<br /><br />The highlight of this book is the beautiful watercolor illustrations of the magical creatures found throughout the book. These illustrations are detailed and large, with many filling up the pages, and there are also many sketches scattered throughout. In addition, all the pages have the antique sepia look which lends it an air of credibility as a genuine tome on magical creatures.<br /><br />My daughter and I both love this book and we have spent many happy evenings reading and discussing the creatures described in this book. There is a list of recommended titles at the back of the book for those who wish to read more on the subject. All in all, I would highly recommend this for fans of the story as well as those who enjoy reading about mythical creatures.
0300169787|5.0|I saw the exhibit three times,it's great to have a piece of McQueen in my home....a true force of creative nature!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|A good collection of hits by an up & coming star.Has a bright future ahead of her. Has come a long way since American Idol days
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Gillian Flynn's other two books, Gone Girl and Darker Places are much better.  I like her writing so I decided to go for it.  She doesn't have the finesse with the story telling like she does with the others.  It was her first book and you can see the improvement as you read the others which I thought were brilliant.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|I'm tryingg to download this to my amazon kindle...but the message error in the download..please try again. Ive tried again a day later. Is there any thing I'm doing wrong..cause I did pay for this app and.kinda would like to use it..Help me!!
B002XBVQKW|5.0|It was a great picture!! I always loved this movie but being an older movie I wasnt expecting the picture to the that great! It was awesome!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it. Great show. Great acting. Really love everything about it. It is very interesting to learn about that era.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I have become such a fan of this man. He speaks about true life stuff that happens in everyones life at one point or another. Some of the tracks are funny, some are serious, some are the best dance songs EVER!I can't even say anything about his music in a negative way at all. I don't like a couple of the featured artists, but Love Love Love Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's work for sure!! It's about time we have some real artists come out and without a record deal. Most artists jump right into record deals and they become something they are not and fall off if they don't sign. These guys are going to go far!! Great job you two! :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've almost finished this book and found it easy,entertaining, light reading which was exactly what I was looking for.  It was a book that I didn't have to think too deeply about, easy read.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It was more like a thesaurus than a dictionary because of the names of people being in it and what they did.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I remember listening to S &G when I was a kid. greatest songs ever. I still have all their albums on records too.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The story line is great The character developement is great. Politics good but overall it i long winded reason for 4 not 5
B00AESN8XY|2.0|This is a knockoff of a free online game, but they charge you to play it to it's full capacity.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|Nicholson is a good replacement  for Bogart, and the story moves well.  I enjoyed the old cars and clothes.  Felt like the 30s.
0316287059|3.0|I was very disappointed with this purchase...I had high hopes with this book by Kevyn Aucoin, but was disappointed to see very little instruction on how to get these looks.  I guess I expected more of a tutorial type content.
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|Definatly a great movie just thought it was too short for a Lord Of The Rings film. although the storyline is great with the same/great actors :)
0316286850|3.0|Next time, I will research my makeup book purchases a little more before hitting &#34;submit order&#34;...this one was a dud as well...sorry !!!  Okay if you like to look at pictures, though...
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This was fun.  It took a minute to figure out what all I could do but great way to pass the time.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|A friend of mine loned this DVD to me with the comment that I would  &#34;love it.&#34; I watched the DVD enraptured by the songs, lyrics and pagentry of it all. I loved it so much that I purchased my own copy so I could watch whenever I wanted. Truely this is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best!
B00005JM02|5.0|I don't usually buy films for kids, but these day a  good laugh iss worth all that was invested in this DVD. The opening is hysterical<br />If  you have ever watch pigons they all goat  oncee were the  food  is. in this case a group of segals perched on a roof look down at one of there budiess and think he has been drinking, from thier I do not  want to give away the begining. I am sure this is a family classic  that you should buy. I give it a 10 star rating<br />Bob Geco
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|This is Ludovico Einaudi's best work.  There's more electronic sounds and a larger variety of other instruments in this album compared to previous albums, but it blends flawlessly.  This is one of the most incredible pieces of music I've ever heard.  Every song is fantastic.  If you're a Ludovico fan, you will not be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everyone was saying that this book is a must read.  Well - it's a not read for this Christian southern woman!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kid loves this app.  However, it is very pricey.  To me, I don't understand why it is so fun for the kids but it is the app everyone is talking about.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book full of surprises. Didn't see that coming. Keep reading as it is worth the slow start
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a tough one to put down.  I really liked how the book kept going back and forth between the characters point of views.
B008M721MS|5.0|I have a grandson in another state, and a granddaughter who travels quite a bit.  Skype comes in handy when they want to show me something they're working on and either ask for my advice or simply show me things that are going on.  Also, the picture I get on my Kindle Fire HD is so clear and sharp it's unbelievable.  Amazon and Skype both got this right.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Good relaxing game.Loved it on my  PC now I can take it with me on the go. Two thumbs up.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I've just finished season one...years late, in my opinion. Oh well, better late than never I suppose. The actors are compelling, the storyline is thrilling, and the action is pretty much non-stop. Besides the lovely male bodies (and I'm a fan of those too!) this provides a glimpse into the gladatorial system and culture that both enthralls and disgusts. But I have a feeling it is pretty accurate. Go into it with an open mind and appreciate this series for what it is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! My brother and I totally recommend this game! It is just like temple run! No problems- get this app!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This show is still great, but I feel like the story is moving at a snail's pace this season and its hard to stay interested in the lives of all the characters.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I like the levels and it's great for wasting time and it's not that difficult to play does run my battery down
B000UZPIAW|1.0|My own personal hell dimension consists of Dawson Leery's crying face covering every surface while the audio of this book plays on a loop. No lie nor hyperbole, this is the most misogynistic, self-indulgent, whiny, piece of exaggerated material I have ever read. And really, that's saying something since I read both Tucker Max and Anais Nin.<br /><br />1. We all have crappy parents and even crappier childhoods. Anyone who tells you differently is either lying or part of the 1%. Normal is an illusion. And as far as Nikki's childhood....pssh, cracker don't know dysfunctional. Know who had a messed up childhood? Joan Crawford's daughter, any female in the middle east, and every second child conceived in China.<br /><br />2. I refuse to believe Nikki kept an accurate, well-documented diary during his relevant years.<br /><br />3. Who over the age of 9 starts every passage with, \\"Dear Diary...\\"? NO ONE!!!<br /><br />4. To feign shock over the lifestyle of a rock 'n' roller is ridiculous. THAT'S why you become a rockstar!!<br /><br />5. Writing a memoir (read: narrating your shoddy flashbacks to a moderately talented ghost writer) to \\"wake up others to the lifestyle and hopefully deter them from following in your footsteps\\" does not equate with \\"I need to stay relevant so my dealer will finally start returning my calls\\". Just sayin...<br /><br />6. The absurd coloring of the pages made me ill, rather than make my inner \\"glam rocker\\" (an oxymoron, by the way) fist pump in solidarity.<br /><br />7. His mom should be ashamed by the way he talks/treats women. So, also, should any girl/nostalgic woman who slept with him.
B009FZFONO|1.0|I feel like AMC is just milking it at this point. How many episodes on the Gov? I stopped reading the comics almost 4months ago(got a kindle for xmas) because I got to his volume and I didn't want to spoil the show for myself. Meanwhile they still haven't wrapped it up on the tv series.... Its like watching Naruto, the plot never advances.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This has to be the best calculator app for free that gives you simplicity. It's big number buttons allow you to do work quickly and effortlessly and its history allows you to check what you did before. All together its a great app.
1451620829|5.0|if you grew up listening to Kiss you will love this book but it will break your heart as well...I won't spoil but things aren't always what they seem even if you are a power band and seem to have it all.....easy read, worth it....

B003ZYU3T6|5.0|bought as a gift for a friend, he is into film and blu-ray and I have not heard him stop talking about the picture qualiy and extras.....a must have for fans.....

B008XG1X18|5.0|great app to use on Kindle instead of having to sit at your computer.  super convenient and easy to use. definitely a must have for Pintest users.
B000GG4Y3M|4.0|Great story ! Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia as two New York cops in Japan trying to catch a Japanese crimial who has escaped from them !
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I loved it!! Great chemistry between the cast members, and full of surprises. Soundtrack is awesome also, a must see!
B003O86FMW|5.0|super fun, easy quick read. Perfect for vacations, flying anytime you want an easy book to get into. Loved it!
B0085RZGYU|5.0|The book arrived well ahead of time and in great condition. I haven't had a chance to read it yet as I have bought so many books lately, also had Barnes and Noble gift certificates. Know I will enjoy it when I get to it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|A complete collection for a very reasonable price! I am extremely pleased with this collection, such a timeless classic. Will not disappoint!
030758836X|5.0|The book arrived in excellent condition well ahead of the expected date. Unfortunately, I don't care too much for the book as I don't really like first person books that jump from one person to another. I'll give it another try when all the books I bought are read.
0439813786|5.0|This book is incredible.<br />The illustrations in this book are phenomenal.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves good books.<br />The story is wonderful, but it's the look of the book that really grabbed me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my 8 & 4 year old love this on my SG2 and my kindle fire! as soon as I put either down they grab it, all I hear is\\"jetpack\\"
B007OAAK0O|5.0|It was 1983 and Diana Ross was going to appear LIVE in Central Park, NYC for the first time and I couldn't be there for some (I can't even remember why!)  In any rate, if you didn't have an 'umbrella' for the first show, you'd be all WET!  But, Diana Ross, being the 'true' professional that she is was determined to stay ON STAGE and perform to the HUGE flock that attended and what a HUGE flock it was.  As the CROWD roared the RAIN poured and finally someone had the sense to stop the show so that no one would get hurt, including Diana Ross.<br /><br />She agreed to come back the following day and do it all over again...only this time with PLENTY of SUNSHINE pouring down upon her along with much adulation from the crowd.  And what a crowd it was and what a show it was ~ memorable to say the least.  I didn't have the opportunity to be there but because of this seller and his great price and Shout Factory releasing the concert on DVD for the first time, ever ~ I now own it and won't ever miss a beat.<br /><br />An affordable price from a dealer I've dealt with before.  Quick Delivery for a FANTASTIC SHOW-TWO SHOWS;  the abbreviated first 'stormy' show along with the COMPLETE second show.  And, the best part...you won't need an 'umbrella'!!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I was having a problem putting together a picture book and this e-book answered a key question for me. I would recommend it for anyone self-publishing on Amazon. Good to have it on your reader to refer to when new questions arise.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I never watched the shield and now I know why. If you like crudeness and bad language.....if that impresses you about how tough these men are then you might like this video. Offensive from the getgo. I quit watching quickly.
B00275EHJG|5.0|And my granddaughters had destroy the movie by watching it so many times, and also moving it from the living room to the den to watch it again.  So of course this movie is fantastic.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin continues his prodigious output as a songwriter.  This is a very strong, highly listenable work that, as is typical for Mr. Hayward, captures the raw emotion of a moment and expressively conveys it to the listener.  Justin's voice is still strong, his guitar is superb, and he still sounds like he's having fun.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is a great addition to my modest film library.  This movie offers a multi-faceted glimpse into Jesuit, Papal, colonial and indigenous life during a turbulent colonial era and brings to task various social and political issues of the period.  An unforgettable movie adventure.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|It is obvious by this album that Boz still has excellent musician chops.  He is still in great voice, and the song arrangements and musicians are very good.  Boz's cover of Rainey Night In Georgia is superb.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|It is very additive and my nephew doesn't want to put it down.  At for a free game it's very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Addictive and fun! Enjoy having the horse I could never get while none of the downsides! Great for kids to mess around with.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I wish I had seen this movie a long time ago.  it was awesome.  Highly reccomend it to any one.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|i have this game on 3 platforms, iphone, pc and now my kindle fire, this game is just cool and fun
B00338QENI|3.0|Although this book provides a lot of meaningful information about cells and their reproductive capacities, it is burdened with an excessive amount of detail which I found tedious.  Those with a background in the sciences will find it most appealing.
B00942X8PY|3.0|about this game, you fill in the blanks with a set amount of blocks - didn't hold my interest for more than about 10 levels
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|The first almost 40 minutes are enough to make me just choose to watch something else.  The stunning imagery alone (which doesn’t show itself before then) just doesn’t make up for the overwhelming boredom you'll experience throughout the movie.  I read other reviews and reread them after watching this movie and I can’t believe this movie is held so high.  I expected much more.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|slender man is a creepy fella - graphics are good, controls are fine once you get used to them (took me about 2 minutes) - i enjoyed what happens when slender man gets too close - overall an entertaining game
B004GHNIRK|2.0|The segments of the story are barely connected (if at all). At times says the same thing twenty times or more. More like  many short stories rather than one novel.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I was looking for a compendium of words, long enough to dazzle and yet short enough to fit on my phone, and boy did this deliver!
B007SGM084|5.0|It definately keeps you riveted.  You can not put down.  Of course living in the area also helped enjoyment too
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book, like the others in this series is perfection! George RR Martin is a genius and takes you to another world.
B000ASDFEU|5.0|It's hard to believe that that this movie could not get released by a major studio.  Great acting, authentic sets and nonstop action.  An amazing cast of stars, and tremendous bonus features.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I loved this book. The formatting was great and the insider info was really eye-opening. Some parts are kind of scary what happens behind the scenes, but it definitely has not deterred me from wanting to go out to eat. But maybe I think a little more when I choose certain plates and certain dishes!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I can't stop playing it. Another game like it is flow bridges. It's just a supper run game.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The plot line surprised me, especially the ending. You really felt for the characters, their histories, and why they were still single as older adults. It was a really nice, different story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book, I couldn't put it down!!! Can't wait to start the second book to see what happens to Katniss and Peeta.(:
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game has potential to be good, but too many glitches made it hard for my girls to play. The most upsetting is that there is no way to exit the game! I had one of my girls in tears trying to turn it off! Maybe when this gets fixed we'll try to play again, for now it's uninstalled!
B009NNG202|2.0|Attempt at art, just a waste of time although Dustin Hoffman's performance was excellent.  I sometimes wonder how films like this get made -
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has great graphics and is very addictive.  The movement of the horses are crazy GOOD. I LOVE it !
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This movie has something for everyone. It is very funny, at times sad, joyful, full of life. A must see for anyone who enjoys<br />an uplifting, yet never sappy, movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I like to read and this is by far the best book I've ever read. Hands down. Do yourself the favor and skip the sleep you'll miss for the 2 weeks it takes (max) to finish this book. I have a newborn at home and I looked forward to his naps not because I could nap too but because it meant 45 more minutes with Jake... errr, George. Travel back in time and enjoy every word, every delicious sentence of his gripping novel. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get some rest. ;)
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have always enjoyed fractured fairy tales but it this series they really have come 'into their own' as adult entertainment :)  Combining the 'realities' of the tales we all grew up with in itself is a great twist, but then to bright them here to our time and place - what a great new twist :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good read.<br />Plot keeps your attention.<br />Female character is strong with her own career path, which is admired by the man.<br />Both characters have flaws that appear real rather than fictional.
B006FLGBGA|5.0|When Charlton Heston first went to the Planet of the Apes (when I was in junior high!)  I loved it - and found it very thought provoking.  In point of fact it was this series that brought to mu attention the plight of the environment which has had a profound impact on my life ever since... This prequel - showing the origins and just who was responsible in the first place - I figured it was 'us'....
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|There are a million reviews about Downton Abbey.  Just wanted to say that this is a wonderful show and that I'm really looking forward to season 4, even though Matthew won't be there!
0345536886|2.0|I enjoy Grisham's ability to tell a tale and have enjoyed several of his books.<br /><br />This one contained his normal skill at narrative. The characters were well defined and solid. The writing flows and the story is believable.<br /><br />Unfortunately the story was lacking in drama and passion. It was also very, very predictable. At one point I remember thinking \\"surely there must be some major twist to unseat the clear expectations for the plot... \\" There was no twist. You see the conflict, conclusion and redemption from miles away. And in all of that, I never was captivated by any powerful plot development, revelation or heart thumping confrontation with the bad guys. The book simply lacked excitement.<br /><br />He is a good author. I will read another book of his. I just think this one was weak on style.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|The blacktop color (like a charcoal gray) makes this Belkin case seem very high end. Nice quality with a bit of padding in the flaps. Made from a good quality material with a bit of a texture to the touch - believe me, this is a good-looking product and the Amazon images don't do it justice. Case feels durable - what you would expect from a Belkin product - but time will answer that question. The corners, which hold the Kindle in place appear to be strong enough to hold the device in safely even while pulling it in and out of a bag or purse. Belkin is usually synonymous with higher levels of quality assurance. I don't think I've ever had a Belkin product go wrong on me.<br /><br />I appreciate that this case is beautiful, strong, and has a professional look to it.
B009GESJH2|4.0|A nice blend of a little bit of everything kid rock does.  From country to blues to rock and , yes, a bit of hip hop.
078322611X|4.0|This is one of my favorites. I can't believe it has been 25 years. I really enjoyed watching this again.
B00AIBZJLG|1.0|I have seen many CIRQUE DU SOLEIL shows and enjoyed them very much. I liked the last 10 minutes of this movie. I fast forwarded five times just to get through this. There are much better Cirque DVDs out there. This was a boring mess.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|As someone who does understand and appreciate previous PT Anderson movies, this one just didn't work for me. Everything about the movie is really great: acting, visuals, except for the storyline itself.
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|Catchy, melodic, really good driving bass lines, very lounge-y, reminds me of Las Vegas on a road trip.  Elegant and well-produced.  Think Sadê but with more melody and a lot more bass, almost a rock beat in some songs.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out in 1999.  Watch it at least 2-3 times a year but seemed to be getting fewer and fewer times on TV, therefore, bought it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Best file manager to date! Easy to use and manipulating files and folder has never been easier. Recommended for everyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|A very edgy and lustful novel that I couldn't put down! Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time!
B004MC8CA2|2.0|The program downloaded fine. The app acknowledged my password etc. Whenyhe screen showed tap access to &quot;Plans &quot;, I kept getting regected.  I changed passwords, et cetera but no luck.  I am sure it is a good app.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Well here you go... a fun blend of not only RPG and Puzzle but a small amount of resource and city management as well. A fun fast pace game that keeps you coming back for more. If you enjoyed this indie hit on the PC this is a great port of it. Thank you dev for keeping us Android users in mind.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Loads noticably slower than the webpage version on my tablet, so there's no benefit to the app.  It's losing an additional star because after being uninstalled from the tablet, it tries to reinstall every time the tablet is turned on.  My plan was to uninstall, give FB some time to improve, then try again.  Now, this puppy's getting deleted
B008Y73940|4.0|Good movie. Very enjoyable.  The plot was engaging, and the movie was well paced,and not overly long.  It was a nice way to spend an evening.
B00770KR7W|4.0|Master chief is very detailed, love that about McFarlane toys.  He is a little top heavy, which makes it a little difficult to stand him up but it is possible. Shipping was fairly quick.  Packaging was durable.  It arrived in fantastic condition.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Comfortable, decent sound quality, and they actually stay in my ears when I'm running! The cord could stand to be a little longer perhaps, but still, excellent for the price.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I recommend this show. I u r a Dexter fan u will love it. I have said all I have to say.
B00A14SQBU|4.0|This is where I will probably annoy some fans.  Bionic was under rated and under promoted.  I still listen to more songs from Bionic than I do on Lotus.  Maybe it will grow on me more.  There is nothing that I hate on this album, but it only has one or two stand out singles.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Horrible moral values were shown in the movie.  Anyone with any values had to cringe with almost every scene.  We watched in segmemts and the rental time ran out before watching the end of the show.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I like The Script, the sounds are smooth, but the lyrics are not boring.  The lyrical stylings are enjoyable and I definitely will be buying their future albums as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't think of any negative.  The characters are interesting and the stories flow.  The only downside is there aren't enough episodes!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I have really enjoyed Downton Abbey.  We had not watched any of it until a month ago. Many of our friend had and loved it. We are sorry Season 3 is over and are waiting for Season 4. Don't start it unless you want to get hooked.
B007T99ENE|3.0|I would read anything by Ian McEwan, and although I quite liked this I think others by him were better. The stile in this one reminded me quite a bit of John Le Carre, not that there is anything wrong with this. I still would recommend 'Sweet Tooth' as I have been a fan for many many years.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I ordered it in error - wanted a Garmin golf watch which I just got and haven't used it yet - but will this week!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When I heard all the fuss about Downton Abbey, I was mildly curious, but dismissed it as another Upstairs Downstairs type of program. I didn't start watching it until a few months ago, when I streamed it from Amazon. I have fallen for the show completely. The story has countless twists, the characters are complex and well-played, and the cast can change in a heartbeat, which keeps viewers on their toes.<br /><br />I'm halfway through the third season now and will be caught up with the story soon. Then I will join the others who are breathlessly waiting for Season Four.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel is AAmazing! He really potrays what it is to be a Chronic Alcoholic. Great Story.If you know someone in their depths of addiction or recovering from alcohol this gives you even more insight and graditute. Great Movie no matter who you are!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|in a word .....quality! Beautiful graphics. Clean and crisp game play with a nice story line and good audio feedback. Fun without being a job to get through. Good game for kindle fire. Thank you playrix llc!
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Thought this would be a light comedy.  It was about the worst movie I have seen in a long time.  The script writers must have had a 10 word vocabulary consisting of stupid foul womanizing words.  Just plain dumb and I'm glad I didn't pay at a theatre.
B00BF11STU|4.0|May have been a great movie if I could just understand the dialogue. The back ground noise was too loud or some of the actors do not enunciate clearly, either way much of the dialogue was difficult to hear.  Close caption would have made it much more enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game only lets u be in a small area and u can't even open the chest or use the Tnt
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is do much better than the first one!  I love everything that's in it including the monkey thing that chases u.
B00979CS50|5.0|I have to rate this album high on my scale because in my opinion &#34;the Horse&#34; never sounded any better.  I always loved &#34;Rust Never Sleeps&#34; and this is in the same ballpark.  I am currently reading Neil Young's new book and reading about the making of this album with Crazy Horse and it's a delight to read what is going on in Neils mind and listening to the final results.  I cannot name a specific song I like better than the rest on this offering.  For fans of the &#34;Rust Never Sleeps&#34; album, this is a must have and will fit nicely in your collection.  Raw, fuzzy, tight music is what this double CD package offers and be prepared to be blown away.  Note:  Be sure to take this Psychedelic Pill to your favorite party, the crowd will love you for it!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is  easy to read and a great classic. It is very different from the movie--so don't be deceived!
B005K17RU0|4.0|We loved it because it includes wind speed which is very important when we are trying to decide if we want to fish on the coast.
B005H8DEMG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it is quite different from many of Shakespeare's plays and from about anything else. Modern technology does a lot with the characters of Ariel (a good airy spirit) and Caliban (a disgruntled earthy creature). The story is another matter and might not hold everyone's interest. People who are interested in Shakespeare will find it most entertaining. Others might find it kind of wacky and off-the-wall. Forgiveness figures big in it, which seems right for Shakespeare's last completed play.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love my Harry Potter box set. Great price for a great product. So glad I found it, it has provided me with hours of entertainment.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|My 87-year-old mom and I watched this movie together, and we both enjoyed it very much. My mom stayed interested throughout the movie and loved the story. It's inspiring to see a true-life story about someone with wealth who shared with a very disadvantaged young man. Thank you for this great movie experience that I could share with my mom, who is not interested in fantasy, science fiction or crime. It's rare to find a move we can both wholeheartedly enjoy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|We recently read this for book club and it is great! The author really keeps you guessing at certain times.
0143118757|4.0|Got this for a Masters Class and it arrived much faster than needed allowing me to read it early and prepare.  Good content.  Believe it is a complimentary book to any Negotiation class or work.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book I could not put down! Read in one day! Mr. Crouch has the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat on every page. I could not get ahead of the story at any time.  This is something you can imagine really happening, though you will not figure out the ending til the end.  Think this is the best of Crouch's books yet. If you enjoy having your heart race and goose bumps popping, this is the one for you!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Gets ur brain working, torture urself with this game trying to get all the pearls, lock urself in a room with no disturbance, drives u crazy when u see the way to clear each level
1427210241|5.0|I first picked up the book in the series in 1985, and have lived on the edge of anticipation for each of the subsequent 13 books.  After Jorndan's death, Sanderson did an excellent job of taking Jordan's working outlines and filled in the missing gaps to complete the series.  Now that it is over, I hope we see some sequels to this lifetime saga that took over 30 years to publish.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I can't believe it, but it was better than the book. Only part 1 though. I'll be looking forward to the other movies.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast paced, and full of cool twists and turns, kept me from putting the book down.  I have always enjoyed Grisham and like his plots and concepts in writing.
B00821OX98|4.0|Not a bad show, not a great show, but entertaining. It kept me wanting to see what happens next. Wish I didn't have to wait for season 3. Wonder if it will be the last?
B008J34466|5.0|Outstanding songs!  Lyrics can get a little racy, but seem to fit the song.  I think she is one of the most talented artists out there.  I would recommend this album.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Upon dis-banding the Experience, Hendrix took on a more jam approach to his music.  Not necessarily a bad thing, and had he lived, it would have surely evolved into something better than what we have here.  This is no way comparable to Axis:Bold As Love, or Electric Ladyland.  This is just Hendrix jamming with his buddies.  From a historical standpoint, this is probably a milestone.  But as for anything sounding new, not so much.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I like Bruno Mars, and this album is better than the previous one.  He seems to be a very personable artist.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I have read this book many times since I first experienced it during middle school and  it never disappoints me.  It really make you think about the power we give to our leaders and the importance of being an individual.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have been playing it for 3 hours straight because it is that addictive!! I suggest it for people with kids!
B007EDZ20O|4.0|I found the book to be an interesting read because it's the first &#34;full&#34; look at the life of Mother Teresa.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I dont know how I am supposed to wait for season 4. This show hooked me easily. I love it!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I belive Denzel portrayed and did an excelent job showing what a real alchoholic goes through and how one can hide it so well. The same is true of drivers who get behind the wheel and think they are indistructable.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Another Disney masterpiece. always a smile with this movie, and watching it in 3-D was a definite treat.  For kids of every age
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game,although I've only just started playing it. I wish I could've chosen the horses coloring,though. though. It's a fun game so far, and the graphics are really well done.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's books are written so well that they play out like a movie. This one was packed with action, suspense, and a plot twist that is freaking awesome! No disappointment here!
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|I saw the two day rental and the cheap price in comparison to red box and why not. My kids love Disney and even though its a pretty old show they loved it. I was even shocked to watch my son who has autisim sit and watch the whole show twice.
B000TERK3C|4.0|I mostly like country music, but I listen to just about anything except rap. This is a good collection of Radiohead music and if you like them it should be in your collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Hours of fun!<br />There whole family found it entertaining.  Kept us busy for days...challenging yet has all levels for all ages.<br />Glad it was free
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I own all of the Deftones records, so it was an excellent selection to the collection.<br />Reasonably price and enjoy the music.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Loved the extra info on Tyrion, Jon, Bran.  Many phrases are being repeated, poor editing.  The presentation of Aegon is not believable.  I like the fleshing out of Jons' travails at the Wall.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This movie had plenty of opportunities to live up to the first movie, but it just fell flat. If I wanted to watch people doing nothing, I would not rent a movie. Do not waste your time. Just terrible.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Just follow the instructions and make sure that you plug it in the right way.  It works great and dramatically improves battery life.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Even though I knew the story and knew the outcome of events, I was engrossed in the storytelling and acting from the first 5 minutes of the movie. My heart was even racing the last fifteen minutes of the film.  Argo is, by far, the best movie that I have seen in several years. Alan Arkin and John Goodman were fun to watch, and Ben Affleck's performance as an actor and a director was nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />Here is hoping that more Ben Affleck and George Clooney ventures are in the works to entertain and educate us.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This is a very well made app.  My daughter loves it.  Very cute and lots to do...she loves gathering the carts and seeing all the cute animals.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very well executed plot that keeps the reader's interest.  Well written.  A terrific vacation book. Could not put it down.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book is classic Pendergast! Great Plot and intriguing story line. Interesting plot twist furthering the Constance character. I am sure we have not heard the last of her.
B0009UC810|5.0|Blues Brothers sure brings back memories of the rhythm and blues relative to the olden days. The Rock n' Roll scene kind of puts the R n' B music into the background.
B00A14SQBU|4.0|Love that her albums always have a concept and do not follow like a sheep.<br />I like the mix but seems that they pushed to the max and the bass sounds slightly distorted.<br />Other than that I really like it.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Christina's famous song, Jar Of Harts sounds really good. I like also her music video that plays Jar Of Harts.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My first clock since I retired 7 years ago.  I've actually missed knowing what time it is if I wake up during the night.  This one is attractive, and I have one of the Kindle cases that is an angled stand, and I use it on my night stand.  And I have made the display fairly dim so it doesn't bother me.  I do have to keep it plugged in, but that is no problem.  I haven't used the alarm feature on it yet, since I don't really need an alarm anymore after 38 years of using one.  ;-)  It has several other features on it, but all I'm really interested in is the time, altho' I guess knowing what day of the week it is doesn't hurt.  Anyhow, I really like it.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I like the way the round space ships are compared to their soundings. Sure makes them almost little planets themselves.
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|I found this book to be uninteresting and more preachy about womens' rights than entertaining. The ending suggests a sequel that will never come. If you have read the first novel I would stop there because the two sequels are nothing like it and involve huge amounts of coffee drinking.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Dan Akroid and the other one really shined out in this movie. Annie Potts, love that voice of hers. Of course her acting is outstanding also.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever. The standard DVD doesn't come with commentary, so this version is worth the extra money.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Fun movie if you grew up near the arcades of the 80's and early 90's. The movie is a little predictable and much of it would go over the heads of younger kids, but still well worth watching.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The darn thing runs continually, if you kill it, it'll simply restart itself.  My other mail apps don't act this way and I'll be darned if this one will while its on my tablet.  I uninstalled it.  The other thing it was doing that ticked me off was that it would tell me about every new piece of mail (no spam filtering with yahoo) even when other apps were running, as though my wife's yahoo account was the only mail there is.  This needs a whole lot of fixing before I'll load it on anything other than her phone.  Getting annoyed just thinking about this thing.

B004OC07F8|4.0|During strategy development it is often difficult to collect enough supporting quantitative information to analyze and decide the best course of action. The techniques introduced in the Blue Ocean Strategy are simple ways to organize large sets of qualitative information so that a direction and strategy can be set and then quantitative metrics applied.

1599218011|5.0|Kris Carr writes in an approachable, friendly, easy-to-digest manner.  This is important since she feeds the reader an inordinate amount of information that could otherwise be overwhelming.  To-the-point, thorough and empowering, CSD changed my life and influences my relationships at work, with my partner and my family.  Whether you want to go vegan or not, the book is a source of factual information that cannot we taken lightly.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's very good because I love games like this,but it crashes when detailed ads are up and it only happened when the daily bonus and a ad comes up.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Extremely powerful movie.  Make sure the kids are out of the room...wow (opening scene in particular)!!  Denzel nails this role.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|I love it! It has plenty of diversity, good lyrics, and catchy beats. Totally worth the price its going for as well.
B00BESIKWM|5.0|Silent hill is the next best thing to resident evil. This is such a good movie if your into thrill and suspense
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The show keeps you guessing.. I love it.  I can not wait for the next episode to come..looking forward to next season too..
B003ES61EE|4.0|I previously had a Lens Pen and used it until I just wore it out. I got this as a replacement. I love that the Lens Pens are small, compact and so easy to throw in a camera bag or in my back pocket. The basic function of the pen is the same, and I like that there are two cleaning tip options, but mine seems to be flaking around the edges a bit. The brush end seems to be fine, though I rarely use that side. It's a little cheaper than the kind I bought previously, but I like the subtle differences of that one much better, and was worth the few extra dollars.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|A very nice story. I like his books and I am sure you will also ..it is a n easy read..
B005LAII3U|1.0|This disk has advertising (previews) in front of the movie that you cannot skip, and you can't go to the main menu. Furthermore (being a typical Sony disk) it has about 3x more FBI warnings and the like that you also can't skip, almost all of which in language you don't speak.  If you want to watch this movie, you should use Amazon instant video or a similar service, not the disk.<br /><br />The actual movie is kinda of \\"flat\\". There is a lot of good action but it lost the connection with the viewer and feels disconnected.<br /><br />There is a very serious problem here with acting. You can think about Kate Bekinsale what you want, her acting ability is very good compared to the standards of this movie.  The male lead has none, and that turns Kate Bekinsale's performance into a problem.  Jessica Biel does what she can, and I think she constantly improves, but she can't undo this mess between the two leads.  Kate Bekinsale's character is also a bit too furious given what the story looks like in the final edit, some of it is really not well explained, so she ends up looking overplayed.<br /><br />They changed details of story development in this version of the story that have to count as dumbing down.<br /><br />*POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*<br /><br />Namely, there is a key scene where the bad guys want to convince the good guy he is in a dream. The way that he figures out the truth in this movie is a typically hollywood move to make it more emotional but makes no sense whatsoever as proof wrt dream or not.  Likewise, the final escape when everything seems lost seems to have lost logic bits in editing and it is unclear what is happening.<br /><br />Don't laugh but I'm bothered by Kate Bekinsale's hair which is a huge mane in perfect shape at all times, no matter whether she's waking up or just had a gunfight. No fighter in the word would wear hair like that. Apart from never being able to see anything it's also way too easy to grab on to.  This is out of character for thefurious flavor they gave this character here.<br /><br />All things considered this movie looks like they edited with spoken text off. It's pretty, fast and loud but it deserved a bit more of the story.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Great season and good introduction to the new doctor, great sho, quality HD video from Amazon all of this free since I'm a prime sub :-)
B00BESM14U|5.0|Watching this film was like reliving my high school years. Very well written, acted & produced. If you like films like Juno, you will like this too.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|If your looking for a oral book than this book would suffice. However, I find this book not worth my time.  I'd rather read the resident evil books for most of the scientific imaginative minds than this book.
B0081336FO|5.0|Not many programs these days play off of the intelligence of their viewership. This one does. IT is smart, funny and you only have to devote 3 hours of your life to one season because there are only 3 episodes.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great read.  Interesting to read a physician's view of his own illness and how he handled it.  Hard to imagine what he went through.

B00AQ4U6P4|1.0|I think this may be one of the worst movies ever. I had pretty low expectations & it was even worse than I imagined. My brother, niece & I picked it out and we were sorry. It has a lot of good actors, but the story stinks. The production values are really bad, it just looks cheap. Not even campy bad, just bad.
B00BSBU4EC|1.0|As an adult that loves kids movies and cartoons, I was hoping this movie would be one for all ages. But great graphics and an excellent cast couldn't keep this flick from anything but mind-numbing and slightly annoying. It's 'warm' message takes you and the family all the way to the bank- believe in anything sensational regardless of plot and originality.  This is a big budget, twisted ADHD version of Peter Pan. Kids of the world must believe or the main characters will die, all the lights have gone out so everyone clap their hands and waste your money renting this film. I would rate it age appropriate 0-5. If you want a great animated movie, with a great plot and message, spend a buck less on Wreck it Ralph. Btw, did anyone catch the Jurassic Park reference complete with a trumpet rip off of its theme song in the second to last scene? That and Santa using the word \\"epic\\" dropped my score from 2 stars.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake has been music's golden child for the past 2 decades and here marks his return to music after a very long 7 year hiatus. Before there was Justin Bieber, there was Justin Timberlake who took over the airwaves and the hearts of females all over. His last album FutureSex/LoveSounds spawned over 5 hit singles and earned him numerous grammies as well as inducted Timberlake into Pop Musics #1 superstar. However, he abruptly left music behind for a while to focus on other ventures such as acting in films and occasional spots on Saturday Night Live. 7 years later, Justin Timberlake makes a complete under the radar return to music out of nowhere with the song \\"Suit & Tie\\" feat. the great Jay-Z which made all disbelievers and all music industries pay attention to Timberlake again. Now with the 20/20 Experience, Justin has come back stronger, focused and more mature so it's only right he delivers with a bang!<br /><br />The 20/20 Experience contains 10 songs, all accompanied with interludes with an alternate beat. In retrospect, you can say that every song is like 2 songs in one. In concept, this album is suppose to give the impression that you \\"can see\\" the music, rather than just listen. This album, just like the title insists, is an experience, and I have to agree that this is an ambitious album mainstream or otherwise. What I love about The 20/20 Experience is the diversity of different styles Justin experiments with; there are influences of Latin Samba \\"Let the Groove Get In\\", some Blue Eyed Soul with some of the most beautiful orchestral arrangements I haven't heard since Quincy Jones  on Michael Jacksons albums. The intro \\"Pusher Lover Girl\\" can be viewed as a slow start to the album, but the song itself is crafted very well. A lot of the songs contain smooth synthesizers like \\"Tunnel Vision\\" and \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\". You have spectacular horns on songs like \\"Suit & Tie\\" and \\"That Girl\\" and some traditional slow jams like \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\". \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" would have to be my personal favorite; it is not a song you would ever hear on a radio, but the artistry in creating such atmosphere filled with beautiful ocean ambiance assimilated within the production is just breathtaking, which helps create the atmosphere that you are on a beach. The overall song is pretty somber with an unconventional reversed sampling production, but I feel it is a perfect way to showcase how much Justin Timberlake has grown as an artist since his `N Sync days. As a matter of fact, this whole album is a testament to Timberlake's overall talent and ear for music.<br /><br />If there is any negatives I have with the album, it's the fact that Timbaland's production can sound too familiar. There are two songs that sound strangely similar to Timberlakes older material. The song \\"Spaceship Coupe\\" is like a spiritual sequel to Until the End of Time from his last album; and \\"Mirrors\\" has a similar sound to Cry Me a River from his first album. All that aside, those two songs are some of my favorites on the album despite the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Some songs also do feel like they drag on a bit and sound a little repetitive, but that's bound to happen when all the songs are lengthy. This album is great all around, and I just heard that there is actually a 20/20 Experience PART 2 pending to release at the end of this year so I can't wait to see what Timberlake has in store for us in the very near future.<br /><br />Favorite 5<br />1) Spaceship Coupe<br />2) Ocean Blue Floor<br />3) Suit & Tie Feat.

B007T7MIR0|1.0|I downloaded the free version and then bought the Pro version.  However the free version 7 has no way to uninstall it so now I am stuck with it.  The free version also would not open PDF files but otherwise seemed ok.  I would not recommend installing the free version but do recommend buying the Pro version which does have an uninstall button and opens PDF files fine.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|You know it's bad when you are flipping pages to get past the endless and boring sex scenes that go on for 50 pages too long. Each book should have only been 300 pages long. Actually, there was no need for a book 2 or book 3.
B003JLA4KS|4.0|A terrific trip back in time to see what great musicians these guys really are. Fun to see how they have influenced rock groups in North America and Europe. I didn't know Alex was a golf fanatic.
B002MFV2IK|3.0|Super Actors in this, who done a good job.  Something just fell short of it being a good film.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|There are some features I find more difficult to use on the Facebook app vs my computer. I have a hard time sharing photos on a friend's wall vs my own and I find it hard to press the 'like' button on photos or comments of photos once I click on the photo. I also find it more convenient to use FB on my computer because everything is spread out and easy to find in comparison.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I was very exited when this game came out but i just got dissapointed. I personally loved temple run 1 but this just isn't as fun. whenever i try to swipe to jump to het a gem or a powerup, the jump won't register. I find it very annoying, but game is fun so I just try to ignore it.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|As the title of this review states, I had no idea what \\"Life of Pi\\" was about.  I went in totally blind, thinking it was a simple adventure story.  What I found was visually pleasing and spiritually empty.  Mind you, I had no idea there was supposed to be any spiritual element to this film but when I was fully informed of the spiritual message (mostly at the very end of the film) I found that it strongly detracted from an otherwise great story.  In fact, had there been no spiritual message at all and simply a film about how some cope with traumatic events, OR had it been a chronicling of Pi's spiritual pursuits I might have enjoyed it much more.  It is neither but tries to be both.<br />I read some of the other reviews and many people comment that this movie is about a spiritual journey.  In reality there is no spiritual journey to speak of after the introduction of young Pi and his fascination with several prominent religions.  The rest of the story is nothing more than a fantasy concocted by Pi in order to cope with a very ugly and traumatic experience.  There is no spiritual journey contained in that entire section of the movie, just the stressed and desperate musings of a boy struggling to stay alive and sane on the open ocean.  Somehow, the very personal emotional significance of this experience is seen as valid ground to make a universal spiritual statement about God.  It doesn't require much thought to understand the folly of taking such a ridiculous liberty.  Therein the true intentions of the writer are revealed and the full weight of the emptiness of this film hits you like bad breath, momentarily offensive but of no real import.  Were it not for the movie's amazing visuals and the excellent acting of Suraj Sharma (a complete amateur no less!) I would have given it one star, as it is, it remains well directed and acted but poorly conceived.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book! It doesn't beat around the bush, it is blunt but well written. I've also read Max Brooks other book and loved it just as much. I can't wait for the movie of World War Z to come out this June. This book is a must read for anyone that likes zombies even half as much as I do. All those people that said that the stories don't interconnect can go die in a hole. Dissing this book only makes you look stupid as there is nothing wrong with it whatsoever. This book, and his other one too, are on the level of The Walking Dead and George Romero's work.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is good because temple run is one of my favrite games and why I like it is because you get to collect cones and after you get the cones you can get stuff with the cones and because at lest I think it is fun.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Great CD by Coldplay. Paradise being my favourite song. A cd you can play over and over. As you expect, always the best from Coldplay.

B00AFEY7QO|5.0|I love Swing Out Sister. Their smooth music sounds so wonderful. On the DVD, you could tell how well sounding a band plays when they play live. They are so good it sounds like a studio recording. Great shots of the city of Tokyo too. Very Classy DVD. Highly recommended.
B000003CUJ|2.0|....and not just because it takes two CDs and one therefore gets more music: it flows much more successfully and the links between sections are not at all obvious, on the whole. It is also played and recorded exceedingly well, and the conducting,by Jonathn Darlington, is inspirational.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best bond movie by far...<br />The scene with the floating lanterns is breath taking.....<br />I am sure you'll enjoy too...
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the life and times of Jude traveling from England to the United States during the tumultuous times of the sixties. War protests, segrigation, youth vs adults and the oppressive actions of the man, are all touched upon throughout the movie. And it's all done using poignant music of the times. Hard to fully describe this movie, but if you lived it, you must watch it and enjoy. Five stars, a cast of many.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I very much liked this book and the insights it gave into Steve's thinking. It is a pity that he died because of his arrogance.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|The app works fine but why doesn't it have such a simple feature as &quot;add to wish list&quot;? Please add this feature for 5 stars!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Markus Zusak has done it again! So different from The Book Thief but such a page turner. It's a true &#34;can't put it down&#34; book. This author is a REAL writer with all sorts of plot twists and turns up his sleeve. We devoted fans eagerly await your next creation, Mr.  Zusak!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is Avery fun game with lots of great things to not only play the game itch's but get character tokens. I played this game for a lot of times until the entire game reset and it resents again after every run.  Ive complained again and again but nothing has changed. Plus when you run the game gets super glitchy. Fun game but glad its free because its not worth money.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Too bad there were not more episodes.  Characters are great, stories are unique, and the sets are amazing.  Love Nathan Fillion and Adam Baldwin.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Loved this book.  Great story line, loved the little twists and turns, keep me turning the page till the very end!  Everyone who has turned their world into their cell phone will totally understand this book and the emotions while reading!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The writing and acting is superb. This was a great TV series and I am just now watching it on Amazon Video. This show sets the bar for cop genre TV.
0812993292|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, for a number of reasons. I was frustrated with Harold for deciding to walk with so little preparation, with his insistance on keeping to his yaching shoes and his wife's failure to at least find him by car and give him his mobile phone. I also have strong feelings about keeping people alive when they are suffering and, by waiting for him, Queenie must surely have suffered unnecessarily. I was therefore most surprised when my book group were quite so enthusiastic about the book. The resulting discussion led itself, with minimal input from the publisher's questions and I came away having decided to upgrade this to a 4 star read.<br /><br />Harold is retired, his wife has moved into the spare room and his life is dull and unfulfilling. Out of the blue a letter arrives from an old work colleague whom Harold has not seen for 20 years. She writes to tell him that she is dying of cancer and to say farewell. The response that Harold pens is totally inadequate and he hesitates before putting in the post box - he'll just walk on the the next box and post it there......and thus begins an epic journey that takes him the length of England to Berwick upon Tweed. On the way he meets all sorts of folk and has the chance to rethink his life and his relationship with his wife and son. Understandably, his wife is rather baffled by his decision, but she also finds herself spending a lot of time thinking over her marriage and their relationship.<br /><br />I did have to ignore the more practical side of my nature to get the most from this book, but by the time I was half way up England I was rooting for him and his unlikely quest. For me this was definitely one of those books that benefitted from discussion after reading.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|(DISCLAIMER: This is my first review, this is my overall opinion on the CD so I hope that people will find it somewhat helpful)<br /><br />Justin Timberlake has grown since his release of 'Futuresex/Lovesounds', and this CD shows that. I will not lie, I was not expecting this...experience. Nowadays its all about the mainstream and making dance hits, this is a different experience and one that people need to take. The old school music where you can just vibe and relax to has been missing. The only thing that makes this 4 stars are because of two tracks that bring it down. 'Pusher Love Girl', 'Suit and Tie', 'Spaceship Coupe', 'That Girl', and 'Mirrors' are great. 'Don't Hold The Wall' is probably the weakest.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I promise that once you watch one episode, you will be hooked.  Homeland is one of the best I've watched.  Anyone who I've told is hooked after one episode.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a walk in time too.  I liked it being written as a series of letters too.  This gave it an interesting touch and made it seem more real to the reader.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The new slim line plug is great if you don't have a case on.  If you do, this is the answer for most, but not all case.

B000XXTCF8|5.0|Some great tunes I never heard before.  Imagine how great this would be if he sang well.....maybe not.  Recommend with prejudice!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this everyday, once I go to bed... always trying to win... it takes my mind off work.  So easy to play on my iPad. I recently added this app to a Kindle Fire for my mother to play.. She is elderly and this app is very easy for her to use....
B0035MNSPY|5.0|Fear Factory has been my all time favorite band for many years now, and when Dino returned to the band to record this album... it felt like home.  Listening to this album brings me back to the early days of Fear Factory and sounds like it could fit in with the likes of &#34;Demanufacture&#34; and &#34;Obsolete&#34;. Great album. I will put it in my top 5 for sure.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a quick and entertaining read.  If you are a hopeless romantic you will enjoy this book.  It grabs your attention and you will not be able to put it down.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Much like the orignial Matrix movie, this movie captures the imagination in a completely original way.  You can't help but ask yourself... 'am I really awake now, or could I be dreaming?'.  A word of advice.... Do NOT attempt to watch this while doing something else, or around kids, or anything else that inhibits your attention.  This movie is a true 'thinker' and if you miss a few minutes of it, you will likely never catch up.  Even watching it in its entirity may still present challenges... and watching it a second or third time will show you something you missed previously.<br />But this is a great flick, and we won't likely see something this 'cutting edge' for some time.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I'm on the fence about this one. It works well and keeps time accurately.<br /><br />PROS: comfortable, decent price, easy to set & keeps time accurately'<br /><br />CONS: face is smaller than I thought it would be, it WILL run down if you dont wear it continuously
B009NQKXYK|5.0|A fun spin on one of lifes great questions...  This movie does an excellent job of capturing the audience and presenting a beleivable extra-solar experience.  With solid acting all around, and the potential doomsday scenario revieled, this flick will be enjoyed by any sci-fi enthusist and even the casual movie watcher.  Rarely does a space movie make interstellar travel seem like a potential reality in the not to distant future, and how better to capture an audience than with such an awesome story line.
B004J64QR4|5.0|If you love the movie or play, you will adore this concert. It is a different presentation of the much loved musical numbers of this beloved stage production. Performances are outstanding. Well worth the $ and time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Famtastical book and the title says it all.  Will agnostics and aetheists change their viewss maybe some will.  For believers this will only fill them up even further.  I found the book to be a good read and in my case. I belkeve it really does prove there is a Heaven.  The case is well laid out.  Descriptions of Heaven are a little slim one would like more information but that is nit picking.  I trust that money is not involved i.e. the author will not cash in onb his experience- if hew does then I would really question the entire book.  For now I believe.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|This a excellent movie.  I watched with my son and he really enjoys it.  It has an Spanish track that it's totally stereo
B000J670ZI|5.0|I am a fan of the old movies and Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn....This comedy is beyond silly and funny and was a great way to spend a rainy afternoon.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie kept me involved in the story.  My son could relate to the movie which in turn makes me see things through his eyes..
B0058VW36U|4.0|Challenging to say the least.  Sometimes frustrating but thats a game for ya.  None the less its fun glad I bought it.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|When using this on a droid phone It will not allow me to update my contacts on the phone. I must go to my computer and use hotmail contacts. Also calendar is not included on my version anyway. If they worked those two issues out I would even pay a little something for the app. I hope they do I use it on all my devices to keep them all insync.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Ok come on now, who does not love Angry Birds.  Ive been stuck on a few of them for awhile but eventually break through
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of musicals, but this movie was incredible. Anne Hathaway played the role of Fantine incredibly. The entire cast did a great job, and I was extremely impressed with the way that the movie turned out. Also, knowing that each actor sang live makes it even better.
B003B02OOG|5.0|This book kept me going and going.  I really liked reading short stories, hope he comes out w/another one like it
B0042TV4IW|4.0|The BBC just rolls them out.  Viewers of Downton Abbey will recognize Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle) who plays a very principled stonemason in this series. While the characters are somewhat stereotypical, the actors surmount that aspect. The staging and costumes are well done, and the constant strictures of class and custom infuse the episodes. Good family entertainment without much treacle.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Typical Child's......entertaining, fast paced, and easy to read.  Some good plot twists and turns. Some violence but not too bad.
B000UIVRXG|5.0|Awesome movie. Awesome actors. You should buy this and watch it and enjoy yourself. Buy an extra one for a friend.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler continues to be one of my favorite musicians.  Privateering is an absolute treat --- a double CD for which I can't decide which CD to listen to more.  Knopfler covers a variety of genres on the two CDs and does them all justice.  For the moment at least, Privateering is my favorite non-Dire Straits Mark Knopfler album that isn't a movie soundtrack.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The series was an amazing adventures full of twists Nd turns.  These books were hard to put down and Is a book for all ages.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I just started to watch these series.  The film and sound quality is very good.  In addition, close caption is available. It is an outstanding production that will keep you absorbed every minute.  I will certainly recommend this.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Amazing cast, even though nearly all are unknowns. The entirely of the cast has a unique aspect about them and pump out the cliches of hilarity like no other movie. The plot is as expected but never lets up with the comedic value!
B009G41CG2|5.0|I so love Mahjong.  It challenges the brain by making you think,  It's very addictive and enjoyable.  Cudos to the inventor
1609611543|5.0|I think this book is a must read for everyone.  It explains very well the problem with modern wheat and the damage it does to our bodies.
B00AECGQF2|2.0|Really fun for about 10 minutes but there is very little to do in the game. Very very very boring
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|I don't mind the odd break from realistic films with a cheesy animal slasher flick where the animals are determined to kill off every human in the film. But you need the non animal parts of the film to be at least slightly plausible to work, and you also need them to be fun to watch, such as was done with Snakes on a Plane or Bait (sharks in a supermarket). Even Jaws where Bruce went on a killing spree, at least the human and town parts came across as somewhat realistic. But this one just doesn't make sense at all, every intelligent things a survivor of a plane crash should do starting off with never leave the crash site so rescuers will find you is ignored, everything that should kill you doesn't such as a couple of minutes in a freezing river and no way to get warm immediately after, jumping off a cliff into a tree. That's not even mentioning how a bit of paper survives the whole film intact. Yet the whole film has a serious tone to it. The writers needed to make a decision, are we making a fun cartoon style film or a serious one. For large parts of the film to be accepted by the viewer we needed straight away to believe we were watching a cartoon type unrealistic world with humans and real life non cartoon scenery.<br /><br />Deleted scenes we should have seen in the film which may have let the viewer buy the events of the rest of the film for example - we should have seen where a wolf after seeing the other wolf that was shot for no apparent reason at the start of the film, getting on a phone and calling the alpha wolf telling him his daughter, sister or whoever has just been murdered and his killer is about to get on a plane flying over their den, or maybe they could have done this through a relay of howls or something. The wolves coming up with a way to bring down the plane and scenes of them doing it, maybe highpawing each other when they do it. Some plausible reason why the humans can't stay with the wreckage and leave the most easily defendable against killer wolves and the elements shelter. A plausible destination that the group was actually trying to reach, rather than just venturing into more and more remote wilderness, such as known bankrupt still intact winter holiday camp or something.<br /><br />The Grey as a dark psychological film if that's what is was supposed to be probably would have worked better as a simple survival film without the ridiculous non realistic wolves at all and simply focused on the men trying to survive against the elements, hunger, cliffs, rivers and even each other.er wolves and the elements shelter.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I liked the story and I really liked the writing. How anyone could make a story of a boy, boat, and a tiger, is amazing.  The book was great. I look forward to reading more books written by Yann  Martel.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Using your streaming services for the first times.  comparing it to my apple itunes/icloud account situation and considering making the change.  your product certainly seems to be easier to use and cheaper on the surface.  the testing contingues.
B000W91RUG|5.0|According to the receiver of the gift it arrived successfully and on time. Item was purchased during the holiday season.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The book started off as a quaint pallet cleanser (I just got off of ready a very heavy and depressing book so this was supposed to be light upbeat fantasy).  It started off well enough until I started noticing problems with the author's writing style:<br /><br />Problem 1:  Timing.  This book would be loads better if the words or phrases of \\"a few months later\\"  or \\"at the end of summer\\".  The author uses nothing to suggest that time is passing and thus the book with all this action and travel seems to take place in 3 days.  With that idea in mind whenever someone laments over their best friend failing, (or succeeding) you always wonder \\"why do you care? you've only known each other for 36 hours.<br /><br />Problem 2:  Everything in this book happens suddenly.  Walked into a room and suddenly a chair fell over, suddenly a butler arrived to straighten the chair, suddenly a waiter appeared to place food at the table, suddenly a drink appeared, suddenly dessert was ready.<br /><br />Problem 3:  (similar to problem 2) Everything that happens the lead character finds embarrassing.  This may be an attempt to show that 14 years old (the age of the main character) is a socially awkward stage.  But embarrassed and righteously angry are the only two emotions this kid ever seems to have.<br /><br />Problem 4:  I must admit this one is what made me put down this book and not finish...about 75% of the way through the characters find themselves at a bar.  The main character is embarrassed (see problem 3) because he's never even had a beer before and his friends of 48 hours (problem 1)  are giving him a playful ribbing about it.  The author clearly forgets  that at about 40% of the way through the book the character wakes up with a hangover after drinking to passing out drunk at a festival.<br /><br />Minor nitpicking point that bothered me, but technically nothing wrong with it.  The main character is named Thor.  We already HAVE a literary Thor.  Whenever Thor whines or cries orfights or blows his nose or whatever, I keep imaging the Norse god of thunder.<br /><br />In the end the rough outline of the story could be interesting, and I'd like to read it again in about 3 rewrites...perhaps these problems clear themselves up in the following books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. It deals with some deep issues and is a real eye opener. It's one of the few books that has made me cry.<br />Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of everything about The Perks of Being a Wallflower! I immediately downloaded this book and the soundtrack after seeing the movie!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Amazing. That's all  got  say. For a big game with excellent graphics like this to be on a kindle fire hd is just amazing.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Really fun time waster.  wish objectives were more clear and that you could speed through the water. Fun times ahead.
0151008116|5.0|very good book, I enjoyed reading this book. Book was new & in good condition. I would recommend this book.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The book is so unusual and it kept me reading all the way to the end. Loved the charcters and the setup and story
B001UTW7QU|1.0|This is a gory show.  I love science and hoped we would spend some time on the subject but instead it's one gross scene after another with a never endnig tease that something interesting will happen.  Well I giveup...
B002ZBN13A|5.0|You will like this CD especially if you are a fan of Evanescence. Sound quality is also excellent. Music is personal but I would give it a shot.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Good game, would have liked it to be a little longer, but enjoyed it. Really enjoy the hidden object games then this one is for you.
B002ZBZNPO|4.0|This is a good CD. Music is personal and I did not like it as much as their Fallen CD but if you like this band, I would make the purchase.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I can't wait for their next CD to come out.  Love their &#34;Better Dig Two&#34; and haven't heard a bad song from them!  They compliment each other!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I like this book. it presented a great picture of a slave's life in the time period.in the book.Just because a man owned a woman slave , did this give him a right to use her sexually?
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Hard to sit through, way too long and not very interesting.  One of the worst movies that I had ever watched.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book is very thought provoking and well researched.  I would recommend it to anyone with whom I may have the opportunity.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie has an excellent story with  a solid script. It touchs upon an universal theme of human nature. If you are looking for a fast paced movie then this one is not for you. There is however enough to keep the viewer engaged. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Enjoy.<br /><br />Mr. Cobb
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great movie......excellent acting. Depicts alcoholism and addiction accurately.<br />Denzel Washington may well have deserved an oscar for this performance.<br />Great supporting cast as well.
B00867GHS8|5.0|the grandkids loved the move, I think I may have to buy another one because they watch this one to much
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Very intense  moved quickly . A little hard to keep up with so many characters. Still enjoyed the book. I always like Baldacci.s books. Would recommend to most anyone
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I would recommend it for most ages except<br />very young children.I plan on owning all of the Twilight movies.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Rango was more violent than I expected.  It also contained many sexual innuendos.  Fortunately I didn't down this movie for my son to watch but rather for my husband and I .  We both were unimpressed and thought the movie rather dark. Not what we expected in a family film at all.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|C'mon man it's breaking bad.... it's the ish... enough said. IT'S THE BEST.. DON'T MISS OUT<br /><br />*Breaking Bad: The Complete Fourth Season*
B001BANK32|5.0|Wow. Where do I even begin? I now understand the world's obsession with Stephen King. Why did I wait until 2013 to start reading him? I'm not sure now. I've loved most of the movies as long as I can remember. I love horror stories. What's wrong with me? Haha.<br /><br />RECAP: Danny Torrance is a special boy. He's touched, has a gift, the ability to see things he shouldn't -- like into people's minds, into the future, things from the past.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a struggling man. Mediocrity and failure have followed him since his abusive childhood, but he has a loving wife and a good boy. After making some mistakes, he gets a second chance -- a job to get them through for a while that will also provide free lodging and food. So he takes his family up to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado so he can be the caretaker over the winter months.<br /><br />They arrive on closing day, where they meet the cook, Dick Halloran, who instantly sparks with Danny. The special bond comes from what Dick calls \\"the shining,\\" the gifts that Danny has above and beyond the others Dick has met.<br /><br />As they settle in and prepare for winter, strange events start to unfold -- voices, lingering presences, moving topiaries, and the like.<br /><br />While the snow cuts them off from the rest of the world, the Overlook stirs to collect its prize...<br /><br />REVIEW: I have NEVER read a book with so much set up and build up information and storyline that didn't feel like filler or wordiness. I seriously felt that every detail King provided about this family's history was necessary to properly tell the story of what happens to the Torrances over their time at the Overlook.<br /><br />The characters in this story are all very well-developed -- Danny, Wendy, Jack, Dick, and most importantly, the Overlook Hotel and its denizens. Yes, it's fair to say that while Danny is the main protagonist, the hotel itself is just as much a main character as he is.<br /><br />This book masters the hauntedhouse story, as well as the \\"cut off from the rest of the world\\" feeling, the buildup of impending dread, and the creation of a rich history surrounding the hotel and the family.<br /><br />King's novel does a much better job of showing this family as a normal family -- one that has its issues but still is happy and loves each other -- and how the hotel tears this family apart than the movies do. Kubrick's film unfortunately makes Jack's character appear insane before the real story begins, whereas the novel makes you go through his transformation and eventual loss of himself. Terrifyingly sad, really. It shows how the hotel can chip away at the man's weak points and destroy him.<br /><br />I seriously enjoyed this novel, and can't wait to read more of his classics. Now, I'm off to go rewatch both Kubrick's film and the TV miniseries of The Shining. This is definitely on my re-read list. :)
B00846WWVM|4.0|This is a cute game. It is somewhat challenging, but just right for my 8 year old. I don't know if I would have paid for this, but i got it as a free game of the day.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Now I'm looking for season 3 reruns on TV and waiting for season 3 on Amazon Prime. I love this program!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game! It is challenging, fun & relaxing. I play it every night before bed.  They do recommend wearing headphones while playing it and I can see why! It's like you totally submerse yourself into the game. All outside distractions are gone! I do wish they had a help or tip screen, but I usually keep trying until I get it. Even though I got it as a free app I would still spend $4-5 for this game!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is great. I have it on my kindle and my phone. available in many versions and searchable. I can't say enough good things and It was free!
B008JFUNAU|2.0|The opening credits of \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" raised hopes for an outstanding movie that soon crashed like a deflated balloon. \\"Oz\\" has visual interest in spades, from the black-and-white opening sequence in historically accurate aspect ratio to the wide-screen sensory cornucopia of the land of Oz, but a successful movie must amount to more than the sum of its images.<br /><br />I've seen good work from all the main actors (James Franco, Mila Kunis in \\"Black Swan,\\" Michelle Williams in \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" and Rachel Weisz in 1999's \\"Sunshine\\" with Ralph Fiennes) but found the performances in \\"Oz\\" perfunctory at best. The story felt like a \\"Rango\\" remake: a limited character who has only faked it in the past lands in an alien world where people think he's a desperately needed hero. He finds out whether he can live up to their expectations. The pacing was often slack, the tone wavered between childlike wonder and adult cynicism, the jokes were few and far between, and in the end I just couldn't care.<br /><br />I don't know if the filmmakers meant to target kids or nostalgic adults. The kids I saw \\"Oz\\" with were tepid in their enthusiasm. The adults could not help but compare this bland commercial exercise to the passionate artistry of the 1939 classic. I can only attribute the stunning initial box office success of \\"Oz\\" to a desperate longing for escapist family-friendly entertainment.
B005HSL626|3.0|My daughter loaded this game on my kindle.  It is fun, but I'm not addicted.  I play about 3 games a month.
0452277752|4.0|The Bachman Books is a collection of 4 books written under. The Pseudonym of Richard Bachman. Bachman is the alter ego of Horror writer Stephen King. Each book has a separate theme go them and each are uniquely different.<br /><br /> Rage is the story of a young man who takes a class hostage. It is not a deep story, but does hinge on the psyche of a troubled young man. This story was pulled shortly after the Columbine shootings. While entertaining, it is deeply troubling. A true work of modern horror. 3 stars<br /><br />The Long walk is set in a dystopian future, and is centered around a contest held every year. The winner of the long walk not only wins whatever he could wish for, but also his life. The final sentence of the book has been giving me chills for years. 4 stars.<br /><br />Roadwork is the weakest of the four novels. A commentafy on government interference and inefficiency. The story dfags on and on until the last few pages where the action literally explodes then dies out with  a few minutes. You can safely read the first 2 chapters then skip to the end. You have won't have missed a thing. 2 stars<br /><br />The Running Man. This is a fantastic story. Reality TV before reality TV existed. A game show where contestants literally run for their lives. Action packed, will plenty of thrills. I was able to read this one quite easily. I would say this is the best of the collection.<br /><br />It you are looking for a great collection of books, this is one to get.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Engaging story line.  Creative plot with nice allegorical twist.  I would recommend the movie to others - little deep for kids.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I hope they never stop making them.  Just watched 1 and 2 the last couple days along with the commentary as the movies played.  I'll buy this one also to see the extra's and behind the scenes moments.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game keeps me guessing, never giving me the same course twice. Just when you think you've conquered it, it kicks it up another notch.
B0026KZ3T0|5.0|I rented this again because I wanted to see Jeffrey Donovan in a different character than Michael Weston. I've been a will smith fan forever and when he does a movie I don't see &#34;Will Smith&#34; I see the character he is playing.  So that is why I have rented different things with Jeffrey Donovan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|unlike most gmes that have cash-shop  money it is free to get the gems in this game everytime you lvl up i enjoy the different mini games as well because they are just my style of game i guess seriously EVERYONE should play this game it is way better that PETZ horsez lol
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This was something I first read in my teens.  Now in my fifties, I found it just as affecting.  It's an end of the world novel and very thought provoking.  It's also by one of the masters of science fiction and well worth the read.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|It's amazing how one man can go from living by the devils rules to bringing beauty to the world. Congratulations Nikki.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|Not what I expected from the Song of Fire & Ice author, its a series of space vignettes with a portly loner protagonist who is the crazy cat man of space.  He's intelligent and I didn't really like him a lot, but i enjoyed reading his stories and seeing his thought processes.  Surprised GRRM didn't go farther with this character, but of course, then it would take longer to finish his current series and we wouldn't want that.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|I just couldn't get into it.  I thought it was kind of dorky.  Not my kind of movie.  No more to say
0894803123|5.0|This book as a lot of the Ben&Jerrys recipies that you can get in the grocery stores. I love certain flavors of Ben&Jerrys ice cream, now I can make them myself. It's so much cheaper this way.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|Fits the new Kindle paperwhite perfectly.  Very classy.  High quality leather.  I have a screen protector so I don't anticipate any of the problems listed in other reviews.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is so fast and exlierating but the sound effects are kinda fake and it takes forever to get the objectives but overall it is an amazing game
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I like the concept. It is a fun game and can get really complex. It would be worth the money.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The imagery in Life of Pi is stunning, from beginning to end.  I thought this would be one of those movies that critics praise, with great special effects, and very boring unwatchable story.  I was pleasantly surprised that the storyline is interesting, and filled with suspense along with spectacular cinematography.  As near as I can tell the story deals with the conflicts/choice/need between faith and rationalism. ...all told in a stunningly beautiful story.
B001BAO5O0|5.0|The July '65 mono U.S. version of OUT OF OUR MINDS (LL 3429), with its color photo from the Rolling Stones' [[ASIN:B00B8NMB9Q 12 ×5]] session, has a different playlist than its British counterpart, including a track (\\"One More Time\\") found nowhere else. This retooled LP hit the #1 spot on Billboard's 200 Albums chart later that year and ultimately earned an RIAA Platinum Record for selling over a million copies.<br /><br />RANDOM NOTES<br />Keith's falsetto backs Jagger on their Chicago session waxing of Don Covay's \\"Mercy Mercy.\\" \\"Hitch Hike\\" is a hand-clappin' Marvin Gaye cover. Jagger/Richard's original \\"The Last Time\\" was a #1 pop hit in Britain and #9 in America (in March '65). Their remake of Sam Cooke's \\"Good Times\\" is a nice change of pace for Mick and his mates. \\"Spider and Fly\\" has the feel of a tune tossed off in the back of a tour van. It's casually bluesy and has clever lyrics. \\"I'm All Right,\\" written by the entire band, is credited to the fictional Nanker/Phelge songwriting team. It's a \\"live\\" track from the Stones' final British tour before they crossed the pond to record in the U.S.<br /><br />\\"Play With Fire\\" is another group effort assigned to their pseudonyms.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|I'm usually not big on symbolism, but it certainly captured me and made me think it through.  It was lovely to watch and tugged at my heartstrings!
B00275EHJG|5.0|This classic tale blends all of my kids' favorite characters and some great new ones. It is a tear jerker for parents who realize just how quickly our kids are growing up!
B00BHMF578|5.0|You know how it ends and still, you're on the edge of your seat for the entire film.  Amazing!  Ben should have been nominated for oscar - best director.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is a great combo pack. We have had family Star Wars marathon viewings and the entire family enjoys the series (from the 5 year old on up!)
0439813786|5.0|The drawings in this book are great.  If you have only seen the movie or heard the audio book, you may be really missing out.  Check out the drawings!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Was one of the better MI films, good story line, some of the older characters brought in late in the movie. Sets up for sequals
B0015DROBO|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!  The story is inventive and complicated but not messy. The writing is clear and evocative. It's a page turner.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|It's definitely a great movie about the Vietnam war. It makes you take a deeper look at who was affected and how they were affected.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This middle book to the trilogy is perfect. It takes Salander's and Blotkvist's characters and helps to further develop them. It introduces new material while bringing in important points from Book 1. If you loved the first book, you really should read this second one.
B00BSBXA98|1.0|Didn't realize what the movie was about and it was not a good movie to enjoy at all. Don't recommend it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I was a bit skeptical, but find myself looking forward to each new episode.  Enjoy Kevin Bacon in the role of &#34;Consultant&#34;
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't put this series down. Admittedly, I'd never heard of it until I saw the first season, putting it off as some other nerd's fantasy. But when I started reading the books, I became that guy. I just hope Mr. Martin finishes this series before he dies. That'd be great. Not the dying part, the series part. Of course that depends on how he views death...
B007U8U1V8|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't sure about Jack White and his music, so i didn't give it a chance for a long time. I finally decided to buy this when it was on Amazon for $5 and I have to say it is fantastic! It is a little off-beat, but amazing! Jack really is a talented guy. I listen to it non-stop now ...
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I love this movie. It's very cute and none if it makes me cringe while watching it with our 5 year old. No bad language, and no over the top, wish they didn't just show that, violence.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|While I am convalescing my husband found Lee Childs’ books in the sale bin, and despite the very strong maleness about these books I sort of became hooked on gun savvy, coffee swilling Jack Reacher.  “Wanted Man” is an interesting twist on what Jack gets up to as he purposefully travels the US to what end we don’t know. Bring on more Lee I just can’t help reading them.
B0088W8QSU|5.0|Nothing terribly deep, but good fun action with interesting characters.  I watched the series on Amazon and I liked the whole thing!
B000SW4DH6|5.0|could watch this once a week. wait. maybe i have watched it once a week for the past 11 years
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love this calculator, wonderful to have on my kindle.  Like that is large and so easy to see.  I certainly recommend to download it.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|After I downloaded on my Coby tablet Mid 7035 I opened app right away and it worked great. But once I closed the app , it seems like it tries to open, but when u type in the search box and hit enter u get nothing. Has anyone else run into this problem?  If so how did u fix it?
B008XG1X18|4.0|Really cool, but can become so overwhelming.  Like it when I have time to spend just looking and absorbing information.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I am not sure if the problem is with the ipod or with this receiver, but lately it has been having a hard time connecting to the headphones i have. I know the headphones work fine because i can connect them to my phone no problem. I hope this problem resolves itself as i use this at the gym on a daily basis.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Majong is very calming after a stressful day. The game is easy to  manuver and I love it. The color of the tiles could be a little more colorful;  other than thst I really enjoy the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Futuristic drama about the evils of controlling government.  Saw the movie but the book brings more to bear on this story.
006224454X|5.0|My daughter had scarlet fever. Sunday night I had to go sit at the pharmacy and wait for her medication to be filled. The man behind the counter told me it would take 35 minutes so I immediately knew I needed to go find a book to read. There were a lot of books but the one that really stood out to me was Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson.<br /><br />It's a story of a woman who' s been told she's been in a horrendous accident that's robbed her of her memory. But not just the memory of who she was and is and anything about her family... she's unable to remember anything from one day to the next. She falls asleep at night and then wakes up the next morning remembering absolutely nothing from the day before. With the help of a well meaning Dr. Nash and a secret journal she's been hiding in her closet (that he calls to remind her about every day) she starts getting her memory back in flashes. She writes down what she remembers and the next day when she's forgotten again she goes back and reads her previous entries.<br /><br />That's when she finds out that things just don't add up. Someone is lying to her. And she can't tell if what she's seeing is memory or fantasy. She doesn't know if she's fabricating some of her memories because she desperately wants them to be real.<br /><br />I don't normally read this type of novel. I'm more in to the paranormal and fantasy stuff. Maybe with some historical fiction thrown in there. But I'd seen the movie Memento and it was one of those movies that really screws with your mind and this book seemed to be just like it when I read the description so I had to grab it. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine what life would be like if I couldn't remember any of it. Would I wake up not knowing my own children. Not knowing my fiance or my family. Being told what was going on and who everyone was and having to rely solely on the word of other people to get through the day. But that's just what Christine has to do. Rely on everyone else (in this case it's her husband and her doctor mostly) to tell her who she is. Only there ends up being miscommunications and unfortunately some of her memories get twisted.<br /><br />The book was definitely suspenseful. I kept waiting for her to get this big revelation and suddenly remember everything and it was SO painful to have to read that she'd continuously woken up just as she had the day before. Completely blank. It was hard to formulate theories because every time I thought I had one I got the rug pulled out from under me and had to start fresh and try to come up with another one. It was a complete page turner.<br /><br />It directed emotion well. I felt sorry for who the author wanted me to feel sorry for, I was angry at who I thought I was supposed to be angry at... and then the book took this huge hair pin turn and chucked a curve ball at me at the same time. Magnificent read.<br /><br />There are some things in this book not suitable for anyone under the age of 18. And some things in this book that could trigger unhappy things in others. So I would recommend this for adults only. But I absolutely suggest you pick this one up if you see it at the store and give it a go. I'm really glad I did.everyone else (in this case it's her husband and her doctor mostly) to tell her who she is.

0765325950|5.0|Thank Light for Brandon Sanderson!<br /><br />I had really enjoyed the Wheel of Time series early in college so I was thrilled when I first saw this, but then I approached listening to the audio book with trepidation.  The only book I ever threw into the garbage was Scarlett, a sequel to Gone With the Wind.  Scarlett was not written by the original author and I had not read carefully enough to realize that Mr. Sanderson had written A Memory of Light instead of Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Mr. Sanderson took notes written by Mr. Jordan, filled in the gaps, and created a continuos flowing, logical book that gives an ending.  The ending is perfect.  There were a few too many battle scenes for us female readers but there was enough of the strategy and planning to satisfy us otherwise.  I cannot think of a character that was forgotten in this final book; you get to meet old friends and you get closure.<br /><br />Mr. Sanderson did a phenomenal job and I would be happy to forward him my list of requests for more books from authors that are no longer with us if he is interested in trying again.<br /><br />I won a copy of the audio cd on goodreads.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Downloaded this app as the free app if the day. I was pleasantly suprised by it, nice change to the standard match 3 games out there, it's a rather large app in memory but worth it. Works great on my Samsung galaxy s3
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I remember (as best a 64 year old can) the death of John Kennedy.  Take history and sprinkle a little what if Sci-Fi and you get 11/22/63.  Eric Flint could not have written this any better.<br />Thanks Stephen...
B000NYT1M6|5.0|I actually ordered this for my nephew after my son received one last year for his birthday. These are the best toys. They are durable and my little boy and nephew LOVE all the detail. I have already ordered a crane truck and will be adding to our collection.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|Slower read then beautiful creatures. Fair but tired of the series. Boring Lena and Ethan. No end in sight. Ok
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is great on all aspects: great storyline, great picture, and great adventure!  It definitely deserved the four Oscars it received; What else can I say?
B0063IH60K|4.0|good<br />easy simple fun enjoyable<br />recommend  to any one simple  to play and stress free no talking required<br />easy to see
1449320104|5.0|If you're a seasoned developer, or considering becoming one, this is a must read. This book contains straight-forward updates on what C# 5.0 offers, along with examples and real day-to-day information.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Excellent story. Wonderful moral taught. Very moving. A must read for everyone. Thank you Amazon for making this a free book!<br />Michael Phillips
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I give any book about 100 pages to grab me.  I gave the Life of Pi about 150 because I thought it showed signs of becoming more interesting.  It didn't!  So I guess I won't know how the rest of the book come out.  Just my thoughts.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I decided to upgrade from a Q6600, and what an upgrade it was. Very noticeable speed difference and a great product from Intel. Not sure what else to say, but it plays the latest and greatest games great, and is reliable.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|My wife loved it.  So many great CDs for a low price -- so I loved it.<br /><br />Three more words here, as required....
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie is great. It is soul crushing and heroic and loving and funny! From my husband to my five year old son everyone gives it a thumbs up.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I enjoyed it but this book took forever to read.  It was a great book to read at bedtime.  Snoozy.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I ordered this as a gift last year.  Thank you!  My sister-in-law was very happy to receive this for Christmas!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the complete opposite of a stupid app this app I say WOW to and like very much this app is AWESOME
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Hobbits, dwarves, trolls, goblins, ancient swords, wargs, orcs, elves, magic, Gandalf.  Dragon!  Gold!  Gollum!  And of course, The Ring. Bilbo finds his courage. Awesome production values and a great script, lovingly and skillfully adapted from the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun and amazing!!!!<br />I play everyday and can't wait to get on when I get home!!!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I love the Bond franchise and am by no means a hater of Daniel Craig. I did enjoy the stripped down, gadget free approach of this movie, reminiscent of my personal favorite, &#34;From Russia With Love&#34;. But overall it seemed humorless and largely sexless.  Production values are excellent of course -- if you like Bond, if you like action, if you like thrillers, then by all means, see this movie. But I hope next time the producers will spend more on a script.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliant plot!  I must say that I am sure God has gifted authors to come up with such good stories.  I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good read.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Lots of fun, but very addictive. Cancell your appointments. A  ew twist on some similar games with good graphics.<br />I
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. It's also fun you don't need internet or Wi-Fi to play. It's easy to get coins and there's cool power ups.you can get people and complete daily challenges,like you have to collect 200 coins in one run.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|I always wanted to attend to one of their functions but for one reason or another, mostly $$$, I was unable to do it, but now I own this movie, in Amazon's cloud, and I can watch it anytime, anywhere I want. The movie is very much exiting with many tricks, bells and whistles. It is romantic from beginning to the end with so many tricks that only the performers of Cirque Du Soleil can perform. I certainly would recommend this movie to my friends and relatives.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this on laptop and kindle. Makes my life easier and very good program. Can't find anything better to use
1568814518|5.0|I purchased this book for my son who has been doing simple origami for years. He was challenged by the tessellations and enjoyed it immensely.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I liked reading American Sniper very much.  From the first person prospective, it is interesting.  It is not about the blood and guts.  It is exactly how it is from the eye of the soldier, and the wife of a soldier.  It was not for the glory of the most kills, but protecting his brother soldiers.  My father was a sniper, and he did not talk about &#34;those&#34; days in Korea.  It was hard to put down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed this season a lot.  Recommend watching seasons 1 and 2 first to get most out of it.  Waiting for next seaon.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This clock works very well for travel .It is has a soft colour to view we like everything about this clock thanks
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This product is very impressive. I initially had a dead battery and there is reports of this happening on other forums. I purchased my working one from quantum wireless and it works great. I can't believe that I have been missing out on this for my entire life up to this point. Get it!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The plot is wonderful.  I hope they don't jump the shark before the series ends....It's just perfect right now!! Can't wait for the next season!
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|One word: Powerful.<br /><br />Samsara depicts man in all his modes of conduct, the struggle to survive, and consume.<br /><br />There are powerful breath-taking images of nature and half hour later shots of factory farming and modern society over consumption of food and resources.<br /><br />This film will make you highly mindful or our plant and the need to be aware of what you allow in your mind and mouth.<br /><br />Must see for everyone.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is just like the controller that came with the PlayStation. It works well and holds a charge like it should. No complaints.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Haven't been playing that long, but so far its definetly got my attention. Its like a miniature version of NFS. love to try and beat the clock. gd job developers.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Fun match three game with a theme of Around the World in 80 Days.  You also can choose to solve a puzzle of a stamp of the country you just completed; or you can skip this puzzle.<br /><br />You must have sufficient space on a smart phone for this app, as for some unknown reason it does not transfer to an SD card - and it's 80 mb!  For this reason I did not give it five stars.<br /><br />Got this as FAOTD, one of the few free apps offered by Amazon that I find entertaining.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I did not think that I would enjoy this film. Once I started it though I liked it so much I watched it twice. Tin Tin was a comic I used to read in the funny papers as a kid so it brought back some good memories. I highly recommend this film!!!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Others have commented on the performance aspects of this DVD.  I agree with those who loved it.  In addition the DVD is technically excellent.  I watched the standard DVD -- the colors were nicely saturated, there was very little noticable artifact.  I listened to the DTS track -- the sound stage was reasonably broad, the voices clear.  There was nice balance between singers and orchestra and there was very little extraneous audience noise.  The video director made excellent visual choices.  I did not notice any shots that distracted from the performances.  There were a number of subtitle choices: Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese.  The English subtitles read well.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Veronica Mars is a smart, fun, and addicting modern noir. Great characters, interesting stories, and great twists. Bring on the VM movie!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Unlike some, I did not find the multiple characters confusing, rather I was impressed with how the author wove lives together even intersecting as characters were unaware. Do read to the end.  For me Rowling's message was strongest as the reader realizes how Krystal (& other characters) wanted & might have had a different life but were denied by circumstances, circumstances that each of us can affect at any time by lack of action, by ignorance, by indifference, by our own troubles, by our own prejudice.  Each of us has a responsibility for compassion, and compassion with action.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I found this story to be captivating from the very beginning and hard to put down.  The main character is someone easy to understand and makes you want to root for him.  My only real criticism of the work is the style of writing seems overly simple at times.  I felt as if I was being beaten over the head with themes in the storyline that were easily understood the first time and their repeated emphasis was unnecessary.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Seasons 1 and 2 were very creepy, surprising and hard to predict. In season three, we've bogged down into more predictable &#34;personality&#34; explorations. Not bad, just not as skin-crawling or thought provoking as the first two seasons.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Kills was a good read!  Definitely kept up the suspense and the plot twists and turns were good.  I'm always excited to find a new author as I read so much!  Good writing that can only get better!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Ben Affleck has given us a pretty good representation of a really interesting story. I watch his movies and often feel he has written his films for someone who lacks curiosity, has less than a high school education, and harbors insecurities about being an American and needs reassurance. I live in Boston, and when I watch his films about Boston, I feel like he is writing for people who harbor insecurities about being from Boston AND being from America, and need extra reassurance.<br /><br />The opening narrative spoken while cartoons and a few snaps from the press sounded like it was from a seneth grade history text.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful, but dumbing down a story that begs for nuance and subtlety was too bad. Affleck does a nice turn as the lead. Alan Srkin and John Goodman are great as well.
B005EVVESM|5.0|if you love Adam Levine like I do.. then this music is for you!  anything he puts out with Maroon 5 is listenable!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I feel like every other episode is great - scary, thrilling, gross, decent character action - and then the next is a little flat or redundant or something.  But overall I love this show - never thought I would get into a zombie show, but I really like it.  I want to go back and read the graphic books, but at this point don't want to spoil any plot twists.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a great comedy movie. Had me rolling on the floor at times. Definitely a good movie to watch when you need a &#34;pick-me-up.&#34;
B007ZI06FE|4.0|This book had just the right combination; an interesting heroine, a hunkie hero, interesting plot and just the right amount of sex.  I was interested the whole way and ready to buy book 2.
B005PZ85SO|4.0|I enjoy this season a lot more than the current one.  Sometimes I think it is over the top violent...
0792165020|4.0|Good fast service met my expectations... I would defiinatly order again from this place as they were very good. I expect to order again soon
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This soundtrack is all original and absolutely amazing if you love real rock and roll! Dave Grohl pushes his creativity and goes way beyond anything we've heard from the Foo Fighters.  You buy now!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun except the Facebook stuff don't like that I have to use coins and notes to expand my area<br />Also having to use Facebook to get things
B0095MVOMC|5.0|i really enjoyed this game, my granddaughter love it, the only problem is that once you find the #'s she know where they are and it's not a challenge for her
B00485H4XY|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves the Tinker Bell series of movies. \\"Tinker Bell and The Great Fairy Rescue\\" is well written, teaches basic lessons, and has a good soundtrack. I don't mind watching this show with her. Bottom line: if your child likes Tinker Bell they'll love this one and you might enjoy it too!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Movie is mainly about a man and a tiger.  That's it.  However, the movie is so well done that I was drawn into every scene.  Highly recommend.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|It's Rush! If you like RUSH you need to add this high quality, high definition recording to your collection. The blu ray disc includes a graphic story (also includes hard copy) that plays along with the music. In addition, a remastered CD is also included.<br /><br />Rush fans, buy this. You won't be disappointed.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I was especially interested in the history of Anne Neville since there are Nevilles in my family history.  The author always does a thorough job of research and this one was impressive. I was worried that she would not be able to to shift her sympathy to this character after her portrayal of Elizabeth Woodville, but she did an excellent job.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I particularly like the stretch band that holds it closed.  However, I did have an issue with the smell of the case.  Pretty strong.  It's very slowly going away but at first it was bad enough that it would give me headaches.  That's why a four star rating instead of a five.
1609611543|5.0|Great shipper! Super super fast! Book was in great condition. It was raining when it arrived and it was packaged so well that there was no rain damage.
0470913029|5.0|My daughter recommended this book to me, changing her diet after reading this book, she was cured from a  skin condition on her hand which had plaged her for many years.
B005K17RU0|5.0|We tried this app and the weather channel app. Both are good but I like this one better. Highly Recomended!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I recomend. this game I did not know how to play at first then a friend showed me and it became very intristing to play
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Excellent movie, Denzel Washington in this movie firmly stakes his claim as the best actor that ever lived. This movie is a must have. Not for kids though. But an excellent movie still.
1616550414|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It's so cool to see all of the sketches and details inside. If you're looking for a cheat sheet, this is not what you need though. It's mostly centered around Skyward Sword, but it has plenty for the other games as well. Totally worth it.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING STORY.  I HAVE SEEN IT MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS.  THE STORY GET YOU AT THE VERY FIRST.  THE STORY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST FROM START TO FINISH.  GREAT CAST.
B008ROZAQU|4.0|This is typical John Wayne with stunning photography. Anyone who ever wondered about how some of the larger zoo animals are captured would find this movie educational as well as exciting to watch. The beauty and power of the animals as brought out in the chase scenes are illustrated superbly. The obvious danger associated with these captures keeps the suspense and excitement levels up. Some of the attempts at humor were a little stale and trite, and there was little, if any, story line, but the photography and scenery more than compensated. A great movie for both children and adults.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|ROME WAS SHOWN WELL IN THIS PICTURE AND THE STORY WAS WONDERFUL.  PECK AND HEPBURN MADE THIS ROMANCE WORK WELL.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Boring with shallow characters sums this movie up quite nicely. Can't imagine why Charlize agreed to do this movie after reading the script.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Easy to set up; very portable; good range, and it works as advertised.  I make several 'road-trips' a month and I needed a portable Bluetooth unit. I selected this 'SuperTooth Buddy' and it does what it is supposed to and is simple to use. What more do I need to say?.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|If you are looking to escape for a bit in a mindless action adventure vampire movie this is for you. If you are looking for something with more of a plot line you may want to look elsewhere.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I'd pay for this. It is very useful and easy to use. If you camp or boat you need this app.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I've looked everywhere and can't seem to find the regular DVD version of this film! I'm NOT buying the bluray version because I HATE bluray! The cases are so much shorter and look bad in my collection--plus, I don't like the stupid blue strips at the tops of each case! I found the DVD version on Barnes and Noble website and added it to my wishlist via Universal Wishlist.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved this movie! It was funny and kept my attention. This is one of those movies that appeals to both children and adults! I would recommend it to anyone.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|ok, so i bought this the other day and it came in the mail WITHOUT THE DVD SLEEVE THAT GOES OVER THE CASE!!!! i am outraged!! it's the best part of the set! i called the author and her rep said that she has no say in the matter! NO SAY?!?! SHE'S THE FLIPPIN AUTHOR!!!! all i can say is it will be a cold day in New York the next time i purchase another Harry Potter DVD!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I typically am not a Sparks fan; they all seem very similar and someone always dies at the end - usually someone we all wanted to live.<br />Ok, so there is a death at the end....but that's all I'm going to say about that part.<br />The rest of this is a bit like that Julia Roberts' movie where she has to escape her crazy husband and moves to the town and the husband eventually finds her.<br />Same story.<br />But, I still liked it.  I haven't seen the movie, but becasue the trailer had already come out when I read this I had a picture of what the characters looked like.  And that's not all bad!  It was a quick, easy read, but it did have some interesting parts where the characters told their version a bit. I liked those parts and was surprised to find them in there.  Seemed a bit unSparks to me.<br />The end was, weird.  But again, I'm not going to say much about that.  It's just odd.  I had to reread it a couple of times and still was puzzled by it.<br />Great to read on a snow day trapped at home, and would also be excellent on a beach or killing time in the car.  Mindless fun!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This story is so amazing and it's one of my favorite books ever! This book is one of the greatest ever! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT!!!
0525478817|5.0|I was encouraged to read this book by a friend who swore I would love it.  She was right.  I loved the characters and the rich vocabulary she had.  I loved her family and the way they nurtured her spirit, vocabulary and dreams but still panicked about her leaving them.  I loved Augustus and his cockiness in the midst of all he had to deal with.  I loved the mystery behind the author and that he kept showing up.  I loved the ending.....<br />For a book about kids with cancer, it isn't all that sad.  More uplifting and poignant.  I have recommended it to several people and each has loved it.  It's just that good.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Why do we watch these things?  I actually had to exit well before the end because watching paint dry would have been more interesting.
0375869026|5.0|I started this book early one evening vowing to read a bit and then head to bed.  I finished this book around 2 in the morning, bawling, and started the next day with a massive headache.  But it was so worth it!<br />I'll start with my one complaint.  The kids in this book don't act like 11 year olds.  They act like middle schoolers.  That kept bothering me, so I finally just made them 13-14 in my head and then the book felt much better to me.<br />August reminds me of why we must get to know kids, and know them well, if we expect to teach them and reach them.  Palacio captures the thoughts of this boy and gives us his dreams, hurts, joys and devastating discoveries.  We live them with him.  I also liked how there were a couple of times that another character told the story, giving us some insight into what was going on around August.  But really, this is his story, the story of how August is August and lets the others figure out how to be around him.  I loved this book, although it wouldn't be appropriate for anyone under the age of about 11.  I have a soon-to-be 12 year old son and I said he could read it, but I'm not sure he will appreciate it without guidance from me.  But the discussions that could be had in a MS class with this book - outstanding and deeply changing.
B008QTUA5W|5.0|An amazing cast, great story line, and an constant sense of uncertainty and imbalance makes this an excellent thriller. This first series is so well constructed and so complete in itself, the second season felt like a cheat.<br /><br />This is as good as TV gets.
B000ICXQXS|4.0|Just a good, fun movie. If you have see Sting II you will love the Sting just as much or more.
B00B7IJBUY|1.0|That says it all.  I suppose many fans who love Bon Jovi from the glory days will be happy if he burps and farts for an hour.  But this music is old and tired.  Do yourself a favor and listen to \\"Slippery When Wet.\\"  It was the last time BJ put out a decent album.
B003204MQS|4.0|One really needs to see all three to appreciate the story, however they are all pretty good on their own accord. I recommend them all. I've not seen 4 yet but hope it lives up to the other three.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am dying to see the movie after having read this book.  I will not add anything more to what has already been said about it but, if you haven't read it yet...read it now!
B004JVXTL8|4.0|It is interesting how the story is being told and the direction it goes. If you've seen the first one, you definitely need to see this one!

B007PVHMCG|5.0|It was sent as a gift for a boy who loves Lego.  He has had hours of fun playing with it.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|So frustrated that I keep loosing my data. I will get the newer sharks and upgrade or evolve and when I exit the game it doesn't save any of it!!!! Grr I love the game but it wont be one I keep playing if it always resets.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Loved reading this book!!!! It was very interesting and hard to put down. Definitely recommend this book. Makes it even better that its a true story.
B000MR1V22|5.0|This movie is sure to enter into the cult-classic hall of fame in the years to come. It is a fantastic, fun and delightfully dysfunctional look at a family road trip with plenty of fun, colorful characters to entertain you. There are lines throughout the movie that have me laughing now just thinking about them. A delightfully surprising little movie with a lot of heart at its center. A+!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|OMG! This CD is absolute HEAVEN!  Hugh has a deliciously smooth voice to listen to: you can just feel the joy and love of this CD.  I thank you, Hugh Laurie, for sharing your passion for this style of music with the world! This CD is sure to become a classic, and I would suggest that everyone go out & buy it right NOW!!!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is the first Wes Anderson picture I have seen and it is a keeper. Like most indie movies it blends quirk with heart and color that makes the entire cast of characters a wonder to watch. Edward Norton as the scout master is the best of the picture, but the two child leads at the films head do not disappoint in any moment they are on screen. Everything from the music to the costumes is something to relish and adore! Moonrise is a sure-fire win. One of the best films of 2012, if not the most fun.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|i like this app on my phone. But i have a Ipad and not a kindle and i have to go on the computer and have it sent to my ipad. I don't like that i can't look for the books on my ipad.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|Hanna is a wild ride of a film. From the first moment to the end the scene-scape is ever-changing and advancing with a blend of odd dark fairy-tale elements and grit. This movie is going in the Joe Wright hall of fame beside Pride & Prejudice and Atonement. It is unlike any other film and it's a wonderkind. Great movie, even better acting and stellar music.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It was a great story, but I didn't think it should be best picture or anything.  I would recommend seeing it once.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It is wonderful to know that so many people have experienced heaven.  I have recommended this to many friends and relatives.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The app is great almost like the Xbox version but must<br />Get more updates but still is a great game
B008Q0AZVK|4.0|I enjoy period films that have a story and this film held my attention until the end. Well directed and acted Bel Ami is worth the time to watch.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Fun, challenging game.  You will end up using your critical thinking skills. Only con I can think of is that it needs more levels--highly recommended.
B004UPALT6|4.0|If you like to laugh this is a hilarious spoof on horror films - this first as usual was the best but this Evil Dead 2 is entertaining
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Not easy to get into--not as good as most of the PD James novels I have read. Kind of slow and plodding in parts.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I found the episodes of Firefly on line.  After watching them on the internet, I ordered the episodes on Blu-ray.  I recommend it.  After this, the Serenity disk is a must.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Awesome read. This book delves into the knowledge that you don't know where your life will go and why it ends up there until you realize what truly makes you happy
B0063IH60K|5.0|Each game takes a couple minutes and playing helps me ignore TV commercials during my favorite shows! (I don't have DVR)
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Beautifullly drawn characters in a simple but enthralling setting, the storyline draws you in until you are part of the tapestry of life in the village. Funny and poignant...a recommended read if you enjoy Maeve Binchy.
B0086700CM|3.0|My son (16 y/o) downloaded this for me. He swears its easy enough for even me to win. So far I crash at every turn! But we have fun with it!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie..outstanding picture..plot shows from beginning to end are just perfect. It shows you have to understand the form of different religions..great perspective...love it..you have to watch it...
B008HJGPVO|2.0|Nothing special her other than the style, go get a pencil with a white eraser (not pink) and you can get the same exact results (except for the cool factor) with the pencil.  Save yourself lunch money and go the functional, non-cool route.
B00933JL0A|3.0|I just didn't get into the game as much as I had thought I would.  Sorry maybe could have spend more time trying to get the game figured out but lost my interest in it right away.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|My kids and I have this movie on VHS so it was absolutely AMAZING to watch on blu-ray. Arrived quickly. Thanks!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Phenomenal. Easy to install and works great. Would strongly recommend for anyone want renote access to their computer. However, you will likely want to pay the monthly charge so you can use it outside your own network.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Couldnt of found this movie sat a cheaper cost anywhere else. arrived in just a few days and plays like new even though it was used.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|It kept me reading, but a little too much detail in some parts. I would recommend it for a good read.
B00000DD2D|5.0|Great cd. This was my first cd by Rogers and I plan on getting many more. This is what blues is to me!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story of two self-absorbed screwed-up individuals  - good writing couldn't overcome this basic drawback in the story.  Don't waste your time!
B008WOULPK|5.0|Grace Coddington is Anna Wintour 's right hand woman. She has managed to garner great press while Her Anna-ness is portrayed as the Editor from Hell. In this memoir it is clear why the two women can and have worked so well together for so many years. They have a symbiosis that has helped elevate the public's interest in all things FASHION. Both have managed to navigate the avenues of female personalities to achieve success. I don't think there could be an Anna without a Grace. Coddington started out as a model and quickly became a darling of the 60's Mod scene. She appears to have controlled her ego and vanity in order to make a successful transition to Creative Director. It is a particular trait of some successful people that you feel you know them (or would like to know them) even though it would never happen. Grace Coddington is one of those people. You applaud her achievements, feel sad for her troubles and end up liking the whole person.<br />A great book for anyone but particularly for women.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Taking any book and making it into a movie is difficult.  The book [[ASIN:054792822X The Hobbit]] is no exception.  I could be critical about how the book is better in this review, but that won't make a movie review it would be a book review. This Blu-ray/DVD/UltraViolet DigitalCopy Combo Pack is excellent quality.  My wife and I enjoyed the movie as much as the other movies about the ring.  In the Hobbit you get to find our how Bilbo Baggins first found it while on an adventure with thirteen dwarves and Gandalf.  Middle Earth is not as dark as in the previous ring movies since \\"The Hobbit\\" takes place before the others and the main enemy is a fire breathing dragon named Smaug.  There are Orcs and Trolls, but they are not as numerous and mostly stay hidden in the mountains.  Any fans of the ring movies will want to add this to their library as well.  I'm looking forward to the Hobbit sequel about Smaug.<br /><br />CA Luster
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun to play. Free version is good. The ads aren't even a bother. :)  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys spider
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This movie was every bit as good as the first one. Action throughout. It was great to see cameo appearances from Willis and Arnold. This all star cast kept it going.
1475143389|5.0|I finally completed my 8th week and am astounded at the results following this program. I decided to ask Mike a few questions regarding going forward and some broscience I had been hearing amongst friends. Mike actually responded within a day of my email and spoke to me like a human being. This is the real reason why I'm even writing this review.<br /><br />It's simple, so simple you may want to do more than you have to. Dont! The best thing about this for me is the energy I get after the workouts. I feel like I can go through walls and move boulders. I trained in martial arts for 7 years and many times felt like curling up on bed with a bottle of Advil. this is a nice change of pace.<br /><br />For those that need to know stats I started out at 156 about 20-19% body fat two months ago.<br />I chose to Bulk as I want to get bigger (although the book has both the cutting and bulking diet plan).<br /><br />Currently I am 167.2  and about 12-13% BF. My abs are already starting to show.<br /><br />(I jump rope for my cardio 25min 3 times a week using the HIIT method.)<br /><br />I can go on and on about how good this program is for me...<br /><br />The only thing I wish this book had was a section on stretching. The only thing it says regarding stretching is dont do it before your weight lifting. maybe in the next edition Mike will elaborate on this.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It was not what we expected and never finished the book.  We only read a few chapters and it was just not our type of reading.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I enjoy this show a lot. It is very entertaining and addicting. I am glad I watched it. Downton Abbey.
030758836X|1.0|A good story doesn't need profanity. So why stoop to using it?<br /><br />Not only does an author cut out a large reading audience but reading any books penned by them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Episode after episode, they keep me wanting more!!!! Can't wait to see where this season leads to...who will live, who will die, it always keeps you guessing!
030759565X|5.0|I traveled to San Antonio last week and on day one realized that I had forgotten to bring a book along!  Horrors.  We were staying on the River Walk and when I googled \\"San Antonio Riverwalk bookstores\\", the only match that came up (besides a very familiar chain) was a mile and a half away in the Pearl district. I set off to find the Twig Bookstore and soon left the interesting part of downtown behind.  Before long, I was hiking up the sunny side of a very hot street lined with car repair shops.  Thirty dusty minutes later, I arrived at my destination.  Twig is a lovely little bookstore and one of the first items I saw on display was this cookbook.  I knew it was out but hadn't had a chance to take a peek.  I enjoy the SK blog so I put the book in my Stack of Things to Take a Closer Look At.  I was hooked before I got done with the first page.  I bought it and paid full publishers price--which if you knew me, would tell you just how impressed I was. If you just want good recipes, stick to the internet.  But if you want the fun of having a cooking buddy coax you into giving her ideas a go, then buy this book.  There's something about holding a book that the electronic format can't deliver--flipping back and forth through the gorgeous photos, the ready access to the contents, space to make your own notes, and the peace that comes from knowing that even if you spill melted butter on it, the book will still \\"work\\".  Deb Perelman's style is charming, funny (snort-laugh funny at times), and full of practical descriptions.  I've been reading this book from front to back, which I've never done before with a cookbook.  Even the recipes that I know I'll never make in a million years (and there are maybe two of those) are still worth the read for the \\"context\\".  Mostly though, the dishes included sound wonderful.  Some are a bit complex but that's not the same as difficult and every one I've made has been worth it.  I appreciate the valuable advice she offers.  For instance....which ingredients are worth the extra trouble and cost to procure, techniques that can be adapted depending on the tools you have on hand, and practical how-to descriptions (e.g., when making crepes, lift up the brownest edge, wait a few seconds for the crepe to cool and flip it with your fingers.)  That's the kind of information that takes these recipes from \\"Gee, wouldn't it be fun to have someone make this for me?\\" to \\"Gee, I think I'll give this a try!\\"
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|While Jackson's rendering of this book is not exact to Tolkiens' story; it is, none the less, EPIC. Beautifully done. I cannot wait to see the other 2 movies that go with this series. If you love the LOTR, you will love the Hobbit as well.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|We weren't sure about it at first but it was a good movie. The movie has a good story that kids could learn from.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app works perfectly everytime.  Does not freeze and loads quickly on both my Kindle Fire and my Android phone.
1439153663|5.0|I rank this book among the top five best books I have EVER read, including The Help (Kathryn Stockett), The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood), and Water for Elephants (Sara Gruen). The Kitchen House was so riveting, that I became obsessed with finishing it, unable to put it down. One afternoon, I jumped on my exercise bike to justify a midday reading. I don't think I have ever encountered another book that made me feel like I couldn't function otherwise, until I had reached the end.<br /><br />I understand the criticisms of people who cite the litany of troubles the book expounds on, for almost every character. I don't like downer books, but I did not feel that this one fell in that category. The events were hard, but believable, and the characters--for the most part--overcame the adversities in their lives. I am in two reading groups and both groups gave this book very high praise. One woman said that she had never read a book that felt so much like being in the middle of a movie, before. Both groups rated this book an average of 9.5 out of 10: very high praise.<br /><br />I can't wait to gobble up the next book by Kathleen Grissom--she is a role mode for all (late-to-the-table) authors.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is durable and offers great protection.  The inside felt cover does not scratch the glass and also catches a lot of lint and dust keeping the glass clean whenever you open it.  The flexible band that keeps the cover shut or open can get stretched out over time so handle it with care, although it still works great for me.  It's just a little loose on either end.  The \\"stand\\" feature works fine, but the divet that the back flap folds into could be a little deeper for a sturdier hold.  Altogether a great case and I feel my Kindle is in the best possible protection compared to the other cases on the market for it.  There is not a scratch or dent on the device and I've had it in this case for over a year, travelling with me in my purse everyday.  It's also pretty lightweight, and doesn't add much size to the device.  I actually purchased a screen protector in addition for my Kindle and never put it on.  You won't need one with this case.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The two words I would use to describe this show is &#34;sophisticated drama.&#34;  Very entertaining and I don't feel guilty after watching it, like so many other dramas.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Downloaded this Yahoo Mail to my notebook and it works great! I can check my mail when traveling or just sitting on the couch. Well worth it!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm sorry to be a spoiler, but I was super disappointed about the ending of this series. I really admired the main character for all the amazing decisions she made throughout her journey and how she would pull through despite her hardships, but she just seemed to dwindle down to nothing in the end. I don't think it would be too much to ask for the author to complete her character development, and to expand on the love story between her and Peeta, which was merely an afterthought by the end of the book (but one of my favorite story lines especially in this book).  It was a page-turner for sure; but looking back, the reason I was turning the page was to look for that moment when I knew she'd pull through like she always does.  Instead I was bitterly disappointed and felt worse for the week after. It was even more of a shock because I'd been so inspired by the first two books in this series.  I can't say I don't recommend this book because the first two were so wonderful and you have to have closure.  I just hope when they make the movie they put a more positive spin on the ending.
B008CRC506|5.0|If you love musicals, this is a great show, full of fabulous songs and exciting dance numbers. I gifted this to my boss, who likes to \\"watch musicals in the background while she does her paperwork.\\" She called me up and said, \\"Well, I put in 'Smash' last night and, dang it, I didn't get anything done, that show is so good!\\"
B0074VA2T2|5.0|I thought this app was so good for my three year old. he loves to learn and it was a really fun way to teach him how to count.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read Colleen Hoover's popular Slammed and Point of Retreat.  There were well executed books, I just didn't fall in love with that storyline, I did say that I would read any of her novels moving forward because even though I didn't feel a strong connection to her other two novels her skill as a writer was evident.  I'm glad I purchased this because I loved it from beginning to end.  Just enough drama and excitement, and a whole lot of feeling in this read.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love SOA! The series is totally addictive. It is shot in beautiful Northern California. The actors are sexy and stay in character.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|Bel Ami may not do the book complete justice, but the production successfully transports the viewer to France of the 1890s (that said, it was filmed mostly in Budapest). With a stellar cast including Ricci, Thomas and Thurman, it could hardly fail, especially with set designers who knew their jobs, a literate script and exquisite period music. Alas it probably was never an Oscar-contender, which is sad because the performances, especially that of Kristen Scott Thomas, are close to the top of the mark. Bel Ami is a nice change from SFX-heavy fare mostly seen today.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this for one song and I loved loved loved every song! He is on another level musically. Its simply music to my ears :D
B003AVPV1O|5.0|IT WORKS!  I am now able to fit two PCs in a limited space. I should have search for this before spending money on other systems that do not work like this one. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to use one monitor for their 2 or more PCs in a tight space.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I've always loved Boz Scaggs soulful voice.  I enjoyed the songs I've never heard before plus the remakes R great.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The beauty of Stephen King' s writing is that he makes the sci-fi aspect seem so natural and normal. What a fascinating story this is. I love when history and fiction is blended and he does it so well. I didn't want the story to end.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|It makes your tears come down at time, it can get really intense and keep you on the edge of your seat. It keeps you wondering how long before they can discover whom is with whom and what is their part in all of this. Wow you have got to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Love it.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Held water from start to finish.  Great action and supporting actors.  Levon Helm's (The Band) role was fantastic.<br />Enjoy!<br />Are we not men?
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Reading this really opened my eyes to both the history and current conditions of North Korea. A book I couldn't put down--the true stories of defectors were so compelling. A big thank you to them and to the author for giving me a glimpse of what life was and is like there. As an US Army wife living in South Korea only about two dozen miles from the DMZ, I feel I understand the conflict and the mission much better and I'm even more grateful than before to be an American with so many well-protected freedoms.  Definitely worth reading if you want to understand the human side of this decades-old political conflict.
030758836X|5.0|This was the first book I read by Gillian Flynn. It was the first book I have read in a long time that really brought the characters to life for me. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and could not wait to read more by her. I was not disappointed. I have read all of her books now and am waiting impatiently for another.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Cannot wait to read the next book in the series...<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I don't get excited about an entire album of songs often, but this is really good stuff. JT takes his usual R&B style, and weaves it with some Motown, a little syncopation, and other magic sprinkled in here and there, and created an album that works on every level. Congrats, JT, this is one of your best!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are so nice to look at. Also, the film is very exciting and well acted and directed. Good job all around.
030758836X|1.0|If this isn't the worst book written, it is at least the worst book I have ever read.  All those words, oh my goodness all those words, and for what?  The characters are not someone we care about, their doings are a kind of pornographic version of living, and dismayingly, one finds in the end that neither of them has had the courtesy to die.  A real DO-NOT-READ.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator without many bells and whistles, and it's free.  Honestly some of the calculators you can get get too complicate and if you're just looking for the basics you can't go wrong here.  What's to like about it:<br /><br />1) Big buttons, doesn't take fine detail to use this calculator.  Although the Kindle is very accurate for touch, it doesn't need to be with this calculator.<br />2) It uses the entire screen so no wasted space or anything &#34;junking up&#34; your screen.<br />3) Although there are ads, you don't have to click on them to get them off your screen or anything.  They're out of the way, on the top of your screen.  Most free apps have ads, but I appreciate that this one doesn't make them intrusive.<br />4) It has a backspace key!  So you don't have to hit clear and restart anything . NICE feature!<br />5) You can see everything that you've typed in which is handy, sort of like having a receipt printing out of a printing calculator.  Handy of you want to see where a mistake or typo was possibly made.<br /><br />Overall it's a must have unless you need a scientific or more complicated calculator.  Can't go wrong with this one.<br /><br />-D
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is the 5th in the series, and a continuation of this long saga. I love the writing and attention to detail and the huge scope of the book. I have become a little numb to alll of the horrific violence, but understand it adds to the overall tone of the the story. My biggest frustration is this book leaves the reader hanging with most of the important characters, and now I don't know how long I will have to wait to find out who lives and dies in the next book. It is a guaranteed way to insure future book sales. Ugh!
B005K17RU0|5.0|If you have trouble getting this to work properly on Kindle Fire here are some helpful hints:<br /><br />1) After you enter your home city/zip, hit the City bar - this usually gets it to work properly.<br />2) If that doesn't work, try hitting the back button on your Kindle.  This should kick it into gear for you.<br />3) If you notice that it won't shut off or that it's using resources when you don't want it to, just disable notifications in the settings.  That way it's not clogging up your kindle and will only add new information when you open the program up.<br /><br />The application itself is great, I like that it has a radar which some other popular weather apps don't have.  The weather is pretty accurate too and the interface is very nice and easy to use.<br /><br />Highly recommended app for your kindle!<br /><br />-D
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Good show.  A &#34;thinking man's&#34; 24.  For some reason, Damien Lewis rubs me wrong.  He's a perfectly nice guy and all, just something about his acting style.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very well written, without embellishing the truth. I had a hard time just putting the book down. I recommend it for every person considering a Military life. Killing is not easy!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|This reader is excellent! I needed one that would read .mobi files so I decided to try this one and I have never been happier. Handles .epubs, .mobis, .pdfs, .html (including .css), and so much more. Easily imports all the books I can put on my tablet. Super easy to add/change book info. Great looking interface with lots of ways to view your book list(s). Direct access to screen dimming and font size. I can't say enough about it, very much worth the money!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|The movie's plot is interesting but its the visuals and the cinematography that really inspires you. It's a great movie to rent.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|As a fan of the great barb I was upset when I saw the previews on tv, I refused the watch the movie because I thought it was a conspiracy or just some bs to sell a film. Than I had to ask myself why did this silly movie offend me so much? Than I had to admit to myself it wasn't really just the movie that truly bothered me, it was the fact that even though I am a huge fan of Shakespeare's words, since high school, I simply believed what I was had been told. Without question I accepted what I had been what someone told me was a Fact. Shakespeare was something of an idol to me, so to have that shaken really bothered me. Than I decided, why not explore what you think or believe is truth? So I watched the film and had my mind blown by it. This film has open my mind to Edward de Vere, now I am hunting any books on this person to find out for my self if it possible that he could be the barb who words inspire me. Now it Kinda makes sense why they had to market \\"Bess\\" to the mass public as the Virgin Queen...
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Had to get it for my kids! Ok for me! Love these movies and glad to have them on Blue-ray
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This book explains in an easy to understand manner why and how we should reduce our intake of carbs. My son recommended it to me. After following this guide for three weeks my fasting blood sugar has dropped ten points, and my weight has dropped ten pounds.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|The graphics were cool but the game kept freezing up and it was constantly trying to get me to buy something else. I deleted it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was one of my favorite Harry Bosch novels. It kept my interest from the very beginning. I highly recommend it if you are a Michael Connelly fan.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed watching all seasons and have watched them back to back. I feel a part of their communities!
B0000640VN|3.0|Gave as a gift to my son and his wife. They had it on their want list, so merry christmas.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I am really enjoying this series--it's really like nothing I've ever seen.  Can't wait to go from episode to episode and from one season to the next.
B00006ZXSK|3.0|I think I bought this when the kids were finishing high school. They have been married 3 years now. They love their romantic movies.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Great game wish it was longer and maybe a few more puzzles but fab game and brilliant price hope there is a second one soon
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Got hooked on this show from the first episode.  The story line is well written, you can't stop watching it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love it.I love this game. It is one of the best games ever. Get it! It is worth your money.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It is a decent book.  Enjoyed most of it and was an easy read. I haven't seen the movie yet but am interested.
B003QSLDTA|5.0|Back when Lindsay Lohan was a star.  I love this movie, they do such a good job on the switch.  It's funny, and touching at the same time. I need to buy it as I watch it any time it's on tv.  Love the songs too.  Mark Harmon plays a good step dad.  Good movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I first saw this movie at a friends house.  I had to have my own copy to show to friends and family.  This movie is great for all ages.  I will always keep it in my inspirational/faith section to share.
159562015X|4.0|Far too often someone seeking a career or life change will pick up books like StrengthsFinder 2.0 and expect it to reveal all sorts of concrete truths, effectively wanting life's hard decisions mapped out like an instruction manual. \\"Just tell me what to do!\\" --this is the sentiment I frequently hear, and while I empathize with the frustration, it misses the point.<br /><br />StrengthsFinder, and other similar self-assessments, are merely primers. Use them to connect previously unexplored parts of your life experience, and then use that information to discover new future possibilities. Don't expect a fortune teller, or worse, some paint-by-numbers roadmap to your next job, career, whatever. Your life is too unique to allow some test results to completely dictate the outcomes. To paraphrase a quote I'm fond of, \\"Write your own script. Don't let others write it for you.\\"
0152465073|5.0|I love it both for the wonderful illustrations and the wonderful metaphorical story about what it actually important in life.  The lessons on relationship building are priceless.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Walking Dead is one of the best shows on the Air. The more you get to know and love the characters, the better it gets.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love following the mystery and the characters are fun to watch too. They are like mini movies but have a story line for the entire series
B000WQW988|5.0|This is a concert that I'll be sharing with my family for many years to come. Fantastic DVD of one of the greatest live performances of my generation.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I was unable to reliably charge my Nexus 10 using the USB cable that came with the tablet.  Since I had a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 that never had charging issues with the propriatary cable that charges through bottom of the tablet I decided to try the Pogo carging cable.  I have used the POGO cable for a month and have not experienced any of the charging problems that caused me to go this way.  I am probably going to be ordering a second one for my travel bag so I don't go without it by mistake on a business trip.  The magnector took a couple days to get used to, I it takes less of a tug to disconect than the old Samsung cable.  l have not had any issues with it coming loose after a couple of days of getting used to.  The quality of the materials is good.<br /><br />l noticed some reviews that feel the cable is too short.  I found this to be true of my old Samsung cable and just use a 6 foot USB extension cable which makes it plenty long and does not negitively impact its function.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Visually stunning film indeed and a great story until the end which just kind of ruined the whole thing for me.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We were very happy with this product. We really like that all 8 movies ar in one box. Thank you
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Wife and I watched this with all 5 of our kids...age range from 3-12 and everyone was entertained. Will watch again.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|TERRIBLE, though a great concept. The acting is horrible and every which way (Russel isn't that bad). Yea, the trailers might scream awesome...but RZA's The man with the iron fists falls short of even just being decent. I get what the film was aiming for, but unfortunately I just wasn't having any of it.
1573301183|5.0|This is another must own DVD for anyone who loves live music. This is surely one of my favorites that I own.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it use it all the time it is one of the only ones I use that will down load
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Quick mindless fun.  Worth a download. Can't figure out how to connect with friends, but the game is nonetheless fun.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Not as much fun as I thought it would be.  I found it pretty repetative.  Not my style at all.
B002YE452Y|2.0|I recommend that you go the page with the MP3 version and you listen to the songs before you buy the album. It is very different from the Shakira I know, it is so Americanized that her characteristic style is completely lost. I don't know who wrote these songs for her but I don't think it was her. Bottom line, I am a huge fan but I will not buy this CD.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I rarely enjoy any series so much as to want to purchase it for my permanent collection, but Game of Thrones is one of those series.  The second season is as well done and gripping as the first, and I recommend this highly.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|They're just taking advantage of the matching craze that have made games like Bejeweled and Candy Crush popular.  This game isn't even exciting.
B000KRN0AK|5.0|Classic Danzig, before he became a parody of himself.<br /> Dark and moody, raw and nasty, has that swamp blues<br />feel,. Excellent stuff.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is great television, smart, fast and fun.  All through season one and two, can't wait for season three to get underway.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I have used this app for a few weeks now and have enjoyed meeting several new authors.  Free eBooks is a great resource.  It offers a wide variety of genre.  It offers the choice of thousands of books.  It offers the opportunity to read and experience many different authors.  There is something for everyone in this app and it is easy to use.
B006T5G73Y|3.0|It's not a bad movie, but Hoover wasn't a very interesting guy. He kept his secrets well hidden. The acting was really good, directing was pretty good. Easy to follow, but in the end its a story of a man that held a lot power and a lot secrets and he took them to his grave.
