B00AO7M5OS|1.0|I love Genesis, but this is crap.  Every song made me want to find something else to listen to.<br />I would not recommend it to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love it! Can't wait for next season so we can see how Bates gets out of prison. Love the era!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book just for the fact that it wasnt so far stretch romance fiction that it reminds me that happy ending can happen...LOTS OF MYSTERY WITH LOTS OF LOVE AND LAUGHTER
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great! I wasn't sure if Abyss was going to be worth the download but it turned out to be better than expected.  This game had me so occupied that I would lose track of time during lunch. Great Job!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I don't like the way it ended.  If Season 4 opens with horrible tragedy , it is getting off on the wrong foot.
B008B4KVS8|5.0|This was Howard Hughes favorite movie. They don't make movies like this anymore. An excellent combination of plot, music, actors and writing made this a lasting masterpiece.
B001LM1456|5.0|This is by far the best one of the precludes to the Avengers!  So much better than the previous version that was done.  Marvel freaking NAILED IT!  A must see!
1568363931|5.0|This book is wonderful. It has fantastic dishes and ideas. Really is getting me away from take out and processed foods because those things cannot compare to these dishes. Also, fairly practical. The author has focused on dishes that can be prepared quickly. I'm hooked on bento!
B002UPQ1P6|5.0|For 5 bucks! How could you go wrong? Great selection of studio hits and killer selection of nasty live cuts....Just buy it!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Fascinating characters and subject matter. Great actors. Very well written. Unique approach to exploring serial killers. Totally engrossing and shocking at times.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|So, before anyone flogs me for the title, while giving reasons for why Nolan's Batman is superior, allow me to explain:<br /><br />Is Batman Returns true to the comics? Well, yes and no, but mostly no.<br /><br />*possible spoilers*<br /><br />Catwoman is not a thief, a blonde, and a little deranged; Christopher Walken's character Max is made up; Penguin's story is not cannon either. Not to mention that Tim Burton takes a really dark approach in this one--I would argue that this is perhaps the darkest Batman of any Batman, regardless of the franchise. So, why would I claim that this Batman is \\"the Best\\"?<br /><br />Well, for multiple reasons, a few of which I will outline below:<br /><br />(1) Batman is not really in this movie. I think one of the best aspects of the Burton Batman films is that Batman is almost a secondary character. As such, he remains mysterious as the Dark Knight should be. Also, the less Batman talks, the less we as an audience get annoyed with his self-righteousness and, in Bale's case, horrific voice acting. Micheal Keaton played the perfect Bruce Wayne, in my opinion.<br /><br />(2) Micheal Pfeiffer. Okay, yes, Anne Hathaway did a decent job portraying the old comic book style Catwoman. That being said, Micheal Pfeiffer blew Catwoman out of the park and immortalized her in our (at least the children of the 90's) minds. Hathaway portrayed Catwoman--Pfeiffer IS Catwoman.<br /><br />Which leads to (3): Pfeiffer and Keaton's chemistry BLOWS Bale's and Hathaway's chemistry out of the water. Seriously. That dance scene at the costume party was just pure genius on so many levels.<br /><br />(4) The story was extremely dark and sexual. Most people knock this one because of these aforementioned characteristics, but you know what: I think that's what makes this one the most interesting. It is coy and seductive and I love it all the more for those reasons. Most of all, what is Batman if not entertaining? I would characterize Batman Returns as highly entertaining without being overly serious (Nolan) or overly absurd (Schumacher).<br /><br />Burton, in my opinion, created the best Batman franchise, this one being my personal favorite of the two.<br /><br />(That being said, I would like to give a brief nod to Nolan who saved Batman from the caricatured hades that Schumacher put him in and for creating the best villain of the franchise, in my opinion, with his Joker.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
0316227706|5.0|This book is one of a kind. It cracks me up. Some of the pictures will blow your mind. All of them will make you laugh. There are so many different breeds in this book. I can see the personality of dogs I have had throughout the years in these photos. This would also make a great gift for kids and adults alike. If you like dogs, YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS BOOK!
B004OZZ624|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br />The suspense is always keeping you waiting to see whats gonna happen.<br />The cast was well selected and the plot is what I liked the most.<br />You have to see this!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grishams best. The way the story evolves definitly holds your interest. You think you have it figured it then he throws you a snag to kick you thinking and wanting more
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the greatest Bond movies of all time, a must have in my opinion if you're a Bond series fan. Recommended.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|A reflective family time in heart and spirit. A&#34; must take time to see&#34; film of realism and the human capacity for compassion in the face of evil.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Like it well enough and totally addictive at first but being on the kindle you have to leave app to add someone on facebook so that slows it down some
B005MMY5RK|5.0|Ultimate collectors set that includes a wonderfully remastered version of the classic movie. Also included are some nice prints of movie nostalgia. Highly recommend if you are a fan of this movie.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown knows how to weave a tale that is compelling and astounding. I truely enjoyed all the different plots turns and the ending was great!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the game is fun and addicting.it makes you challenge yourself to complete the challenges. you can also try to beat your friends or families high score.. and its free...free
B009K86D86|5.0|This is a movie that everyone should see.  I normally get bored with documentary's but this movie made a lasting impression on me.  After 4 days, I am now making major changes to the foods that my family and I consume.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|The first book mad me look forward to this one and it was a serious let down I just hope that the bland weighting in this one is just the set up for the next book
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Thats what I said after I watched this movie.  &#34;Ummmmm.... what happened here'?  I am a Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington fan.  I was so excited to watch this movie.  I must say that I was disappointed.  To a degree I feel it made a mockery out of a VERY sensitive, and inhumane reality of slavery.  I was disaappointed in the soundtrack.  But I will say that the actors/actresses did a good job.  But this low budget movie seemed like it would best suited as play or something.  I did however enjoy the comedic aspects.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|The story line is rather passive and does not really capture my full attention.  Nonetheless, I do like to watch how it develops and hope it may improve.  It has potential. We'll see.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|As a long-time Philippa Gregory fan, I was eager to read her account of Neville's quest to put a daughter on the throne.  Kingmaker's Daughter met my high expectations.  Gregory's attention to the prevailing sentiments at court and the social mores that rule women's lives gives added depth to her historical fiction.
B009OYSFDM|1.0|The Amell's character is like a spoiled child with a bad attitude that just cannot be shaken. It gets on one's nerve after a while and one is left waiting for his disposition to change....but it never does.  Terrible!  I'd rather baby sit rascals then waste another evening watching this big baby on TV.  Be warned.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books in a period of 7 days and hated that I had to go to work, because I didn't want to put any of them down!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get it get it get it get it this game is awesome you have survival mode creative mode makes this game the bomb us get this game
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Gets you hooked from the first episode!  Looking forward to season three.  Bought my wife the companion book and she loves it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This just does not work properly with the Kindle Fire.  It's so bad, that it's clearly obvious that the author of the software and the person who approved its release for the Fire has never ever actually loaded it and run it on a Fire.  I wish I could rate this with negative stars, because it's just that terrible.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I was not sure what to think of this movie based on the previews but the movie turned out awesome.  Heart felt and action packed.  This movie will keep you on your toes.  Another great movie to add to my collection.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Star Trek (The Original Series (&#34;ST:TOS&#34; or just plain &#34;TOS&#34;)) Season 2 brought us such brilliant episodes such as &#34;Mirror, Mirror&#34;, &#34;Amok Time&#34;, and &#34;The Trouble With Tribbles&#34;.  True, it also brought us such clunkers as &#34;The Omega Glory&#34;, but overall, the time spent watching a TOS episode is nearly an hour of happiness.<br /><br />The HD remastering of the show is superb - and on a large screen, you can even (occasionally) see the fluzz of the velour here in Season 2 as the costumes started showing some wear and tear.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Being from the area I had own this movie.  I seen it in theatres and was pleased, so I purchsed a copy for my collection.  Coming from a long line of boot leggers I found the movie highly intriguing.  It was an added bonus that the movie was based on a part of my family.  I would reccomend to anybody that likes action movie.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Whether or not you like or love Tarantino's films.  If so, you will like or love this movie, and if you don't you will probably hate it.  Like many of his other films it is over the top with violence.  There is a reviewer who described it as \\"aweful\\" because it was violent and unrealistic.  Anyone who has seen Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastereds, and even Pulp Fiction knows that is Tarantino's hallmark.  He goes overboard on the gore and violence and makes it almost campy.<br /><br />The first 10 min of the film is pure gold.  Cristoph Waltz was great and essentially (if you read between the lines) gave a dissertation on the entire south during that period of history in just a few sentences.  Jamie Foxx does a good job as Django, but it was not anything special.  Samuel L Jackson really stole the entire movie.  He was very much the bad guy of the film.  There is liberal use of the \\"n-word\\" in the movie, but if you pay attention to the entire tone of the film you will know it was done to condemn the time period and the institution of slavery, and not to be degrading.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Tarantino, then this movie is worth having.  It is very much in the same vein as his others.  If you are not, or are easily offended then you will probably want to skip this one.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|I liked the movie.  Owning part one made me have to buy part 2 for my collection.  I did find part 1 to be the funniest but this was LOL as well.  I would reccomend to anybody that like LOL comedy with no holds bars.  Very outrageous not for kids.  Even still great comedy for all adults.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I thought the author captured the 5-year old perspective well. A story of a mother's love for her child in a terrible circumstance.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The LOTR is a family favorite.  Now, the Hobbit will complete our collection.  Peter Jackson did not let us down. Bilbo is a much loved character in our house.
B008A31UO4|3.0|For me, learning a computer involves a lot of repetitious exercises.  There were none in this book.  Otherwise, it is a good introduction.
B00AA8LYBQ|5.0|My 8 year old daughter and I watch it together, VERY COOL!<br />She has a HUGE crush on Troy, I think I'm in trouble!!!!!!!!!
0988178532|5.0|Brandt Legg has created a wonderful book for Young Adults.  This mystical adventure is a fantastic page turner.  The new-age mysticism theme that runs throughout the book holds valuable lessons and words of enlightenment for people of all ages.  This book is chock full of conspiracy, adventure, magic and suspense as well as characters you can't help but love.  I highly recommend picking up a copy of \\"Outview\\", you won't be disappointed!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|LOVE BIKES, ABSOLUTELY LOVE this series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It will be much worse when this show leaves the air than Mash was!
B002PJL85K|5.0|I believe this movie came out in the 80's or thereabouts.  I saw it then, and fell in love with the story, the characters, and the magic of the movie.  I could mention each character and how perfect the actors are for their respective parts, but there's no need.  Whoever cast this movie was a true craftsman, maybe even a magician!  Merlin is SOOOO spooky and yet human, the ultimate Druid.  There is violence (duh) and nudity, but the nudity seems a natural part of the scene, not something that was dreamed up for sensationalism.<br />To sum up, this is a magical, mystical telling of the story of King Arthur, his Knights, and their quests.  Watch it and enjoy!
0545128285|5.0|J.K. Rowling has done yet another amazing job at producing quality literature for the modern generation.  Tales of Beedle the Bard is a great read and includes explanations of each story by Albus Dumbledore.  It's great to read as an adult but also is child worthy.  My wife and I love reading it to our nephew when he stays with us!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Again, I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a drama with multiple, interwoven threads.  The historical perspective is exceptionally well coordinated with the period and principle character's lives.<br /><br />John R.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just completed the third season and was saddened to have to wait for the fourth to begin !<br /><br />The writing and acting are simply fabulous .  Love Love Love this show.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Do not rent this movie unless you want to hear 2 + hours of adult and children whining and cursing. I thought Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd were funny in Knocked Up, but they were just annoying in this movie. I didn't finish watching it because I couldn't care less about these people.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great coming of age book!  Well written and enjoyable.<br /><br />Have not seen the movie; but very much enjoyed the book.  Well written and kept me interested the whole time.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|QT did it again with an absurd yet relevant movie. Acting is great. As usual for his movies, it was graphic and violent with a lot of cursing. Not for the young or squeamish.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great shows in vivid High Definition. I recently found out about Amazons great program for streaming movies and TV series on my tv when ordering their Prime. The best part is that I get most of my ordered items shipped for free in much faster.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It's so much fun to play with the playground portion of the game. I was giggling like a little kid, just seeing what I can add and how things interact with each other. it's a very cool concept that you can put in whatever you can imagine. but when that gets old, you have the levels, which leave something to be desired. some of the levels tell you exactly how to do it at the beginning which takes all the fun out of it. And other levels don't make a whole lot of sense. the duel level is just annoying because the controls aren't good enough to solve the level in two seconds. i won't be forking out any money for updates.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great shows in vivid High Definition. I recently found out about Amazons great program for streaming movies and TV series on my tv when ordering their Prime. The best part is that I get most of my ordered items shipped for free in much faster.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The initial description of this game almost put me off... a group of high school kids trying to solve a murder case while also going to class and managing jobs and other day to day problems.  However, I listened to metacritic and other reviews and gave it a shot.  I am quite glad I did.  This game is easily the best out for the Vita so far and is also one of the most engrossing RPGs I've played on any platform.  The game actually evokes an emotional connection with the characters, something that I rarely recognize in a game.  Sure its a bunch of pixels, but I literally laughed out loud and scared my dog after the scene where two guys, confident that their new scooters will suddenly make them more attractive, do their level best to 'pick up girls' and go horribly wrong.  The other details like gameplay, combat, merging personas to create new ones with skills that wouldn't normally go together and expanding world as time goes on, are all superb.  There are many excellent RPGs out there but few in which I have felt this connected to the characters.<br /><br />In short, if you have a Vita, play this game.  If you don't, it may be worth getting one just for this game.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I loved this book when I read it 30 years ago and loved rediscovering it. If ye  love pirates, read on!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I found this app very helpful in doing complicated calculations. It looks great on the Kindle Fire HD and the fact that it's free REALLY helps! It could do without the ads, but otherwise I found this app to be very useful and reliable.
B0094D462M|5.0|If you have ever watched this movie and didn't immediately want to because Maverick, you're probably dead inside. This movie is the poster child of being 'Merican. There are so many one liners in this movie that I use everyday that help me succeed in life. I owe my used BMW, awesome jaw line, and volleyball skills to this movie.<br /><br />On a side note, have you seen Kelly McGillis now-a-days. She did not age well.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Subtle mix of history and Hollywood.  Affleck makes this film suspenseful, even though we know the ending before the first frame.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I like historical movies as well as great acting, but I thought this movie was too slow, and certain characters were not introduced well. I would watch this again only on a rainy day when nothing else was on TV.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Very good series with believable characters that are interesting to follow from one episode to the next. Worth the time and money to watch.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Sitting home with a broke leg this definitely kept me busy and entertained. It was like a great book that you didn't want to put down. Great graphics and great entertainment.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this game so far...unfortunately she keeps asking me to purchase extras to the game! But it is keeping her busy so I don't mind!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|definitely did not live up to all the hype going on in the media about this particular movie. A little long and drawn out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel had me from the moment I opened the book!!!! I had to force myself to put it down and sleep...so it took me two days to read it. This was a mystery with all sorts of twists and the end just makes you gasp in awe. I highly recommend you to read this.

B0071MV540|5.0|This movie was fun to watch and had some laughs. Would recommend for interesting evening. Most was sutible for children over 13.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|The disc is a must for any Pink Floyd fan, the concert sound is exceptional.  Only one complaint, the picture will go from grainy to perfect high def each time they switch to a different camera angle.  I am not a film engineer.........but I would guess of the many cameras that were used during filming only a couple were high def.  It does not take away from the concert but it is obvious as they rotate different angles you are losing picture quality.  On the other hand, the sound quailty is so good........who cares!
B00881PTRC|5.0|In this one-or-two player twist on the classic, you try to guess the word before losing the game as expected.  What makes this different are the different themes such as paper, Chillin' Chalkboard, Christmas Snowman, and Flower Power.  There are dozens of word lists in several languages, making this even more enjoyable for multilingual and non-English players; the word-list dictionaries in the app are huge, and should challenge any player.  The scoring is odd, and I'd like to see a score based on the number of words modified by a difficulty rating, but that's asking too much in an app that offers a lot of replayability for 99-cents.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ 1 or 2 Player<br />+ Custom Word Lists<br />+ Replayability<br />+ Multiple Languages<br />+ Thousands of words<br />+ Challenging<br />+ Music<br />+ Graphics<br />+ Fun Themes<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Scoring is not well implemented<br />- Needs ability to look up any word<br />- Forces Landscape (not that big of a deal)<br /><br />There are four themes, including a Christmas theme.  My favorite is the default 'paper' theme, followed by the Flower Power theme.  The animation is different for each theme, as well as each game inside each theme.  Interestingly, the object gradually loses pieces instead of pieces being added as in the traditional hangman in the Flower Power and the Christmas Snowman themes.  The regular 'paper' hangman offers humorous sketches; the dev clearly wants you to be entertained while playing.<br /><br />The music is sometimes very good, and other times just good.  There are so many different songs, though, that there is little repetition and almost no annoyance.  In fact, I've let it continue playing as I write this so I could enjoy the music!<br /><br />Regarding the Internet Access permission, beside the (unfortunately) ubiquitous Facebook and Twitter buttons, this app actually has a valuable use for the internet access permission: it allows you to look up the words you failed to guess on the internet using one or more of 5 different dictionary sources.  Hopefully, the developer will add that ability to every word instead of just the one you miss.  Without other permissions, this can't sent much info home, so I'm not going to worry about it - especially since I can simply block the access without impacting the core of the game; I just can't look up the words online nor can I use the Facebook or Twitter (I don't use them anyway) but the game will function normally otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Robert~<br /><br />[EDIT: Not sure why, but this review doesn't show I purchased the game, but in fact I got it as the Free App of the Day.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great playability.  Almost endless variation and upgradeability.  Great online play.  Smooth running and relatively glitch free.  I would buy this game if it weren't free.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another great classic by Tarantino. This movie has a great storyline that keeps pace with the well directed action scenes. Superior acting by all players, except, Sam Jackson's tendency to over act his part in this flick. I watched it twice and would watch it again in the future. I may start a Tarantino film collection as result.
044024613X|5.0|Right from the start, I was hooked. Vivid descriptions of characters and how they interact with one another continues from page one until the end. I felt apart of the family's struggle to come to grips with the realization that their child may be a killer. How a parent faces this dilemma in this story takes many twists and turns. William Landay wrote a thriller which pushed and pulled me into the life of a family put on edge by a sudden set of circumstances no parent ever wants to face. Each chapter made me read more quickly to reach the outcome. Landay begged the question, &#34;Can their be an outcome; will there ever be an ending? A page turner, for sure!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the first 90% of this book. The ending disappointed me a bit, so that's why there are only 4 stars.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I'm literally shaking after just finishing MAMA minutes ago.  What a movie!!  From the first 5 minutes you'll be swept away by the story and there is one twist after another and more and then more with gasps and jumping out of my seat in between.  MAMA is terrifying - I won't forget her, ever.  Worth every penny, a thrill ride of a movie  one that will haunt me for a long while.  OMG.....what a flick....
B00005N6KG|5.0|Works great for pinheads like me. I cant seem to find these anymore however. The last time I ordered them, something else came in its place. I still love the replacement, but they are more fragile than the original.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book and Charlie,I felt like one of his friends I would have liked to read a little more though.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Character development in this series is WONDERFUL.  It's what I look for.  Through the plots I was able to get to know each character and love them...or not.  The stories are touching, but not soupy. The setting is realistic.  The acting is top rate.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I found the book to be exciting with an all  new set of symbols for Robert to interpret.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is a heartbreaking story of inhumanity against our most precious gift_ children.  It's a story about the long term scars children suffer when we treat them like possessions or chattel.  It's a story about the danger of allowing organized religion the right to run roughshod over the very laws of decency and brotherly love they espouse.  But it is also a story about the healing power of love that can be a true balm when practiced by individuals who truly care for children.
0062238868|5.0|I finally finished this book.  Chris would be so proud at how well it has sold.  I enjoyed his natural speak as he told his story a well as the blow-by-blow details of his service abroad.  There is a passage that he writes about no one remembering who he was.  If he only knew. EOW: February 2, 2013 RIP Chris.
0525958002|2.0|Brilliant for what he achieved at a young age alone, and the many years of great music, being a true pioneer and survivor.<br /><br />The man displays cluelessness at times, which is charming occasionally. And at other times it isn't. John doesn't seem to rate Duran's music highly if it wasn't a commercial success ... Big Thing, Notorious.<br /><br />One of the other worst bits was when he shared an anecdote about Sting and Bruce Springsteen. Sting was talking about saving the rainforests, while Bruce had nothing to share on anything socially relevant. John's take on this was that Sting was 'giving Bruce a lesson in \\"political correctness\\"'. And that because of it, Bruce was outdated.<br /><br />That's as deep as John gets, a lot of the time. He doesn't say that Sting is doing something important and he wouldn't know if it WAS important except that it received attention and media hype. He thinks political correctness is the end in itself. The reason for that is that John like many Gemini's are suckers for anything that is popular or enjoys authority. That also shows in his great need for attention: from parents, wife, audience and ultimately God. Instead of finding some great connection in his life or source of wisdom in himself, he looks out there (which most of us do but less so) to the popular trends, fashion etc. He provided an example of his shallowness during the 2008 elections: at a recent book signing he said (that unlike in 2008) that he was more interested in the Roxy Music box set release than the US presidential elections. The point ism that he didn't really care about the latter, but went as far as producing an ad in 2008 in support of the shallow Obama campaign. Because it was the thing to do. Timbaland was right one minute, but when it failed it didn't matter anymore. Then he latched onto Mark Ronson. It goes on and on for this man, and if you look around, you'll find many similar Gemini's floating along, latching on to some fleeting thing which is instyle, with no guiding light of their own, or deeply flawed in their quest for wisdom.<br /><br />On the other hand, he has a deep spiritual drive - and unlike most pop stars, he realized the difference between drugs and what their temporary effect really represented. I think all of Duran has always been a very special band with magic, communicating with the divine in ways that they or others might not be able to make sense of. It is a band of survivors, individually and collectively. They are unique channels for the divine and I hope someday they return to making good music and not stumbling into this egoistic pit of collaborating with talentless hack 'producers'. Medazzaland or even Pop Trash were their last true good efforts. Everything else was aimed at getting scraps of respect. They wanted it the easy way and Taylor would already know how that cost him in his carefree days.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Great graphics, makes me smile.  I find this game charming.  Not so hard that I loose interest.  I'm a low tech kind of girl and this fun ~ a great game when you want to be entertained for a bit.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've been playing this game on Kindle Fire for a week. It works great. I also have it on my computer and this works just as good, if not better. Doesn't have any glitches, I can pause the game and come back later to finish. Great app!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|liked the app but it kept locking up and crashing my kindle fire.  not a gods experience with this app.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I just wish they weren't such short books! But it was a great read, can't wait for the next one!
B004XIVQ7Q|5.0|Rutherfurd's novels have a sound historical basis and are meticulously researched.  Sarum was the first and equal to the best of them.  Another &#34;must read&#34; is the equally mighty &#34;London&#34;.  A wonderful author I only recently discovered.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I saw this in the theater and can honestly say that I enjoy it more in my living room. The story is epic, the filming is splendid and the characters are all so rich. This delivers classic Tolkien to the masses and was an excellent value.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good mix of a love story with suspense. The author kept you wanting to keep on reading, I couldn't put it down.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I turn this on when I am doing crafts that require concentration. I blocks out background sounds and street noises and is very soothing. There are many combinations so you can set the sounds to your mood.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I guess if you are a young adult that was into these books this is the movie for you.  I knew the premise but I have to admit it's depressing to watch these kids killing each other off.  Not for me. The performances were fine though.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Undoubtedly, this \\"Lincoln\\" film deserves five stars for the prime acting of Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, naturally Daniel Day-Lewis (lewis is lincoln) and the direction of Steven Spielberg is captivating enough... the film seems to flaw in the writing department, to base a film on one subject for 2.5 hours seems a long stretch for yawning, especially midway through the affair casting way too many votes...I'm not sure or remember the mention of the \\"battle of antietam\\" for which the Union claimed victory and Lincoln issued this emancipation for the cause or why was not the assassination portrayed in this long venture, John Wilkes Booth was nowhere to be found in this drawn out story of freedom, I guess we can wait another \\"twelve days and nights\\"... this film is worth the while for the acting and history content, it is educating... maybe next time, Lincoln, the beginning.
B001QJUX24|4.0|John Wayne's best?  Hard to say.  But I blue eyed Native American war chief Scar is tough to overlook.  Worth watching
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Even with the videogame environment in which this movie takes place, it's a very classical Disney tale. The videogame references are multiple, in every replay you notice something you missed the last time. If you are a lifetime gamer like me, you'll enjoy the movie as much as the children.<br /><br />A word of advise: the PG rating is appropriate. The Hero's Duty world has a small amount of violence that could upset some parents. Be sure of watch it first before the kids, to decide if you're ok with it. It wasn't a problem for me.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Fun show for those that like science. If you want to see the extremes this is the show for you.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This film is the most romantic in a long time.  Should be on your DVD shelf with An Affair To Remember.
B001EBV0OY|4.0|great story plot, superb actors who keep you glued onto the screen, just to see how it all unfolds. Would watch it again
B007PVHMCG|5.0|smaller than we thought  a be see deed even four great happy I jay kay love me name oh pee quiet road your 18 more words why I do not like to rate sales<br /><br />requirements for reviews are stupid
B009K0P10K|4.0|Gripping!  Just when you think Emily or the Graysons are doomed,  the plot takes a whole new turn!!  Amazing and spellbinding writing!! Very intriguing and intuitive!!
0470901071|5.0|I am preparing for my CCNA and this book covers EVERYTHING! I mean EVERYTHING! A great resource to look back on when we hit a snag too.
B0000A118M|5.0|I first heard this on Spike Lee's &#34;Mo Betta Blues&#34; and had to own it. It's too heavy on the ear for my husband( he says it sounds busy) but I always think of Spike when I hear it.
B001OGRLOC|5.0|This band just gets mo betto! Saw them recently on the new tour and they played as well as ever. Missed hearing this one so I bought it.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Got this for telephone, but thoroughly enjoyed the rest, mainly The Healer. I think she may be too deep for some, she certainly gets me thinking.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|Its Audrey Hepburn... how could you not love it... Enjoyed it when it first came out, enjoyed it shortly after it arrived at my door and now it is mine to enjoy whenever I wish.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I now own every album she has ever made. And what an awesome body of work it is. Would recommend.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Loved playing this on facebook so I'm happy that I can finally play this on my kindle. Even though I need to get up early I'm gonna play it lol
B00364K6J2|5.0|My children and I absolutely love this movie. The stop action animation is great as is the actors. It's cute, smart and funny.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|A very cute book with great lessons for life...<br />I would suggest this book as a bedtime story for a young child.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Only needed to run about 25 feet, both monitors working fine.<br />Would use again.<br /><br />Saves money over buying splitter box
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I must admit Greg has probloms with girls,Rowley,and bullys. Once I read the book I was intrested in Diary of a Wimpy Kid.I love it!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I enjoyed the book it wasn't my favorite but it was good...I didn't love the it but it was worth read.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am female. The story was good. The training of navy seals very interesting. Men would probly enjoy it more.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|First of all, watch this assuming you have never heard this story before. It's not Tolkein's The Hobbit.<br /><br />Second, lower your standards for stories because if I had never even read The Hobbit, I still would not have liked this story. We couldn't even stick it out till the end.
B00CEF014E|3.0|What a whirlwind of a read. This short book (read it in about 3 hours I think) begins with the mysterious disappearance of a man. We don't really know if he exists. Is he real only in the imagination of a woman who we learn has a troubled past? As the story unfolds just about every character we meet has something that adds an uneasiness to the story.<br /><br />There is an unrelenting and tense progression as the book hurtles towards its surprising ending. Just about everything, including the kitchen sink, is thrown in just for good measure.<br /><br />While not the most well-written story, it certainly had some entertainment value. There were enough plot twists to keep you busy trying to figure out who, if anyone, you could trust.<br /><br />I'm left feeling that it was a bit over-the-top, particularly towards the end, and could have been more polished. All things being said, it was an entertaining, quick read that should appeal to mystery lovers with a bent towards the occult.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Not sure how I missed these episodes, I love NCIS. These two episodes were great to watch. I just might have to buy the episodes I have missed in the past
B004V6X902|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Jim Carrey's talent is often wasted in other movies, but this one is perfect for his style.  It is just a lot of fun and, of course, very funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I have come to like more than temple run honestly I have that's saying something : ) (temple run still an awesome game)
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Taleb's books and Antifragile didn't disappoint.  This book is well worth reading as it will challenge your views of education, economics, government and many more.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Just like the original and I am a pacman junky lol its one of the best fun games out there I might have to buu this game!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was an easy read mostly becaues I couldn't make myself put it down!  I took it everywhere with me and couldn't wait to read the next 2 books when I finished!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Definitely a must have. Works great no glitches good app to have comes in handy for games and searches all in all good app
B002ZG9846|5.0|I bought this out of curiosity when it came out on DVD and it is one of my all time favorite movies.  I really like the actors,  the characters they play and the concept.  The dialogue is smart,  witty and gritty. There is also a warped humor like juxtaposing the Banana Splits song against the violence of this seemingly innocent girl.  I just saw that Kick Ass 2 is coming out August 2013 and I hope it is as good or even better.  While it is not for everyone, those that like it,  love it.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|This movie is a great blend of action, humor, and drama.  The cast is amazing!  Can't wait for RED 2!
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Actually I was leaning toward a 3.5 as that is where this is compared to other Tarantino films.  I love all his movies from Reservoir Dogs  to Pulp  Fiction,  and especially  Inglorious  Basterds.  Don't get me wrong,  this is a solid piece of work; I just did not get as drawn in as the others and although his movies are expected to be on the long side,  this one tested even a hard core fan's patience at times.  Good but not great.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I received what they advertised..Well done.The Merchandise arrived on time. I think it is a must have addition to kindle because it made it easy for me to hold my kindle while reading or browsing..
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've enjoyed this series and am looking forward to Season 3 being available via Prime Instant Videos.  Hopefully they won't stop at just 3 seasons ... I have to believe it's a very popular show.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|You may agree or disagree with the ideas contained in the book, but it provides an original ( at least for me) approach about how to look at the future
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I like her candid and open sharing of her own experiences, good and bad. She was able to learn something valuable from everything, even if it was negative at the time. She makes a great point about the way the culture needs to change -- no more &#34;mommy wars&#34;! All options must be respected, and men need to read this book too.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Season 3 of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; started out pretty strong. Cast out of Hershel's Farm by a rampaging herd of walkers, the group has spent the off-season struggling to survive the winter. We catch up with our group as they stumble upon a large and heavily fortified prison, where leader Rick decides they'll take up residence. Meanwhile, just a few miles away, Andrea and new series arrival Michonne are welcomed into Woodbury, where a smiling Governor hides many a dark secret.<br /><br />Overall a strong season, with many twists and turns, some shocking moments, and probably the strongest episode of the series in &#34;Clear&#34;, it concludes with a whimper instead of a bang. I won't spoil anything here, but be warned going in that the finale does little to resolve everything that had happened up to that point.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Recommended by a friend. I have read 3 times! I can't wait for book 3!<br />Characters are very straightforward. Must read.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I had watched the series on TV and enjoy watching again with no commercials! And you can't beat free with Amazon Prime
B002M87V0A|5.0|an extremely great musical. too bad they don't make them like this anymore.  This is a wholesome family movie with songs that will be with you always.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book has it all: good story, interesting characters, and really good writing.  I kept forcing myself to stop reading because I didn't want it to end.  And when I did finish, I immediately went and looked to see if this was a series so I could continue the relationship.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I gave it to her.  She rehurses to it.  She visited us for spring break and sang the entire show.  It was fabulous!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Good book<br /><br />May have to read again<br />Get it<br /><br />You will like it I think<br />I swear you will like it<br /><br />(Typed and posted by my 9 year old son.)
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I am completely hooked on the Vorkosigan Saga and have read the entire series.  This is not one of her best but it is still very entertaining and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was fun to have a story dedicated to Ivan for a change of pace.
B00899DV6O|5.0|Bieber demonstrates his talent yet again with great tracks - even the slower jams are catchy!<br />He is proving himself with his developed voice.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|My only complaint is that the story ended too abruptly. Though one could suggest that it wasn't well written, as it is told from the perspective of a five year old boy, I found the style of writing rather unique.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The large and vibrantly colorful illustration makes for an easy read. List of function time limitations comes in very handy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Well written with internal consistency. At times difficult to connect the various story lines. In spite of that criticism, it is an excellent read.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I just wish there was a search bar of some kind. I is  a waste of time. Shoe cow car
B001E45XT4|3.0|this is going to be my 4th Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset in a matter of around 10 months. My most resent one broke when i was putting in on my head the side piece snapped. I hate buying these headsets over and over again but they are the only headset that i can actually wear upwards to 15+ hours a day with no headaches. The materials used to make this headset are of the cheapest plastics but it is the most comfortable headset you will ever own.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is always good! Many stars in this movie. It keeps your interest and had a good story line
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once again the author goes overboard with the sexual content; however, moving past this, the author developes the characters and draws the reader in to want to know how their relationship will move forward.
B0094K1QR8|1.0|This movie was okay. It had some funny parts, but it's so predictable. You know how it will end before you even watch it. Just look at the cover and imagine the most predictable ending... You're right! It ends just like that. The most surprising thing about it is just how likable Ashton Kutcher is. So unless you want to sit trough this movie just to witness what Ashton Kutcher can do when he's not being some variation of Michael Kelso, don't waste your time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was first interested in knowing what all the hoop la was about with this book.  There were too many explicit sexual scenes; however, moving past most of these, the love story that was actually being told draws the reader into the story with a desire to understand and know the characters in the book.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|It was not what I expected but was pleasantly surprised. As a pilot, I enjoyed the flying scenes which appeared to be real.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Overlooking the explicit sexual content of the book and focusing on the actual development of the relationship of the main characters shows the development of a loving relationship.  However, I think the author left much to be desired in the continuation of the story between the main characters by bringing to much of a diversion at the end of the story.  It will be interesting to see what comes next in this family situation.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This single is awesome.  It is a great collaboration!  If this is any indication of what is to come, I can't wait for the album!
1452115567|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  Maddie is a super awesome dog that happens to have a partner that is good with a camera.  What transpires, from one little experiment, is a collection of photos of Maddie \\"on things.\\"  She looks at ease and patient in the most precarious of situations.  I just love her laid back charm and the variety of photos.  If there was one little thing that I could gripe about, it would be that I wish there had been more!  Maddie rocks!
B004XISI4A|5.0|After the lull in book 4, the story picks up again. Will be a long wait until book 6 is released
B005PK57IK|5.0|I have been hooked on watching this.  The cases are interesting and it is a good balance of interoffice personal life.  I recommend it.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|... But still well worth a read! Plenty of the best characters are not in this book,making it less compelling than the other books
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I really think it is a great show and I like the main characters.  The acting is good and it isn't cheezy like so many others.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Loved this book. Some genuine surprises. Always wanted to read some more, to know what was going to happen next!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins did a masterful portrayal and Helen Mirren, who I always admired was wonderful.  I don't know how true the story was to Hitchcock during the time of Psycho, but it was believable.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|You're not out of your element if you are obsessed with this movie. It has the best quotes and stellar performances from Bridges, Goodman and Moore. I will never get sick of this film.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|After each mini game, advertisements keep popping up. Other than that its a really cool app. If any one can let me know how to get rid of the pop ups that would be great
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game all the time and I never get bored. I recommend this game to anyone especially if they've played the first version.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really shouldn't have read this book before watching the movie. Ruined the movie for me, which was different of course.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Landay is a good writer, well acquainted with the law. Also knows how to dangle the reader at the end of a chapter, so you cannot put the book down. A well recommended, interesting story..
B0063GORYU|4.0|can't quit playing it, another fun game!  A new twist on the old solitare. It is a challenge to work the cards around to win
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I use this all the time - on gigs as a solo act or for jamming with guys I don't play with too often.  Make good use of the favorites and learn to use the auto-scroller and it makes everything so much better than carrying a notebook with sheets!
B0002BO05S|5.0|There is nothing new in the portrayal of Jesus in this movie.  What makes it so good, is the director and cinematographer set up every scene as if it was an oil painting in a museum.  The extra wide screen format is used to its maximum effectiveness.  There are little side stories or activities within each scene.  As an example, Jesus and the disciples are spending the night under a bridge.  As the main scene activity is going on you see normal traffic going over.  You also see people stop and hand their heads over the edge to get a better listening opportunity, then they move on.  It is a feast for the eyes when watched not for the story, but for the visual story-telling.
B00068V384|5.0|A recollection of it after my roommate took it from me as a gift for his birthday. The choir replayed in my mind since then and until now I own the collection.
B001LOPYHI|4.0|I saw Logan's Run when it came out. It was quickly superseded by more technologically advanced techniques, but considering its time, it was pretty good. The miniatures of the city inside the dome are well done even if not entirely believable. The color is intense. The pace of the whole film slows down considerably once Logan and girl get outside into nature and eventually pre-war Washington. And of course, the end it a bit cheesy, but not a whole lot cheesier than killing off a main character as a way of resolving conflict as done in Easy Rider, etc--which, by the way, didn't happen in Logan's Run. See the film as a way of giving yourself filmic context for the development of science fiction since the 60s.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This game is really fun and addicting! I highly recommend it to everyone! I love it, my friends love it, and you will too!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was taken away by this story right from the &#34;git go&#34;! The characters were very well developed and the story line was intriguing.
1452115567|5.0|I met Theron at his first book signing for Maddie on Things. His speech was inspirational and I was so glad to have left with this book. Theron has a big heart for what he does and I think Maddie compliments that spirit. This book won't ever leave my coffee table. It is one of those books that you can look at a hundred times over. If you ever need a little confirmation that there are awesome people doing awesome things for other people, scroll through Theron's projects.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book made me think and re-think opinions and ideas I had held for many years. The mystery only added to the enjoyment. I love the &#34;puzzle&#34; aspect of this style of writing.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|In the '80s I liked to listen to the wild child style of Motley Crue. I was kind of a wild child, well not really a CHILD, but wild. Now, I read this autobiography. Wow. This guy was nuts. Out there. Glad I wasn't as wild as Nikki...
1449410243|3.0|Book had just a few funnies, rest of book was just ok. I would skip this book and buy something else if I could have previewed this first.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great sci-fi tv series that was canceled way too soon. Nathan Fillion is an amazing actor and the rest of the actors do a great job too. It is easy to invest in this series and want more, good thing they made a movie :)
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I deleated this game as soon as I played it once.  It just isn't that user friendly for me since the screen is so little and the voice calling the numbers isn't that clear.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|It started out really good and then it lost my interest.  I will not read anymore or order any sequels.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wish I didn't read this book so I could read it all over again with out knowing what was going to happen!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|SYSTEM OF A DOWN is such a great unique HEAVY METAL band....SERJ TANKIAN is a great lyricist and singer and the band is BRUTAL with strange nuances on the sound and a UNBELIEVABLE drummer(one of the best!)....HYPNOTIZE comes nearly after the HUGE BOOM of MESMERIZE, and got many great tunes too!!!! If you like the SYSTEM METAL style you will like HYPNOTIZE too...GREAT BAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is hands down awesome. It keeps you on your toes and somehow you just fall in love with all the characters.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|I really like SYSTEM OF A DOWN, so i enjoy SERJ TANKIAN´s solo stuff....be noticed that Serj´s solo stuff on ELECT THE DEAD is WAY more ROCK than METAL....There´s some songs more METAL that reminds SYSTEM like EMPTY WALLS, MONEY and UNTHINKING MAJORITY...but i think other songs like SKY IS OVER and HONKING ANTELOPE got some cool harmonica and piano in a more HEAVY ROCK vibe....Well, honestly, i think this is like the evolution of what SERJ could be doing if he is still recording as SYSTEM OF A DOWN.....ELECT THE DEAD is a great album!!! i put in par with SYSTEM´s best stuff like their amazing debut and TOXICITY!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, SERJ!!!!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Imaginative and well written, I like most of Sanderson's book but this is my favorite. I can't wait to see where he takes this series.
B00007E8V4|4.0|While not close to the brilliance of their AMAZING debut and TOXICITY, this STEAL THIS ALBUM got some great songs like CHICK N STEW and INNER VISION....I even think, if this album had a decent front cover and didn´t look so lame it could be better....if you enjoy SYSTEM, you may like this collection!!!!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|must have pacentce, it was free so I'm not going to complain. you'll have to deal with the miss spelling
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Ah! I really miss the SYSTEM OF A DOWN years....After the classic TOXICITY, SYSTEM become a HUGE METAL band on METALLICA and PANTERA level...The first 2 SYSTEM albums are MASTERPIECES!!!! Steal this album is good.....but for me, MESMERIZE is the glorious return of the SYSTEM that reach high with pearls like SUGAR, SOIL, AERIALS and FOREST!!!! BYOB, REVENGA, CIGARO, RADIO VIDEO, OLD SCHOOL HOLLYWOOD.....WOW!!!! THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!!! I think is better than the great HYPNOTIZE....TOTALLY GREAT and RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!BRAVO!!!!!!!
B0030Y11XS|3.0|was not moore best film which he could have come up with a better solution to the problem but interesting and sad to see the stories of families that lost houses and money.
1401937519|1.0|I am interested in NDEs and believe in them.  I believe Anita did have an out of body experience.  However, I believe she misinterpreted everything she experienced.  I came to see that when she insists that everyone is good and no one will be judged.  This totally throws out the concept of justice.  The book goes against everything the Bible teaches. She also says that we are God.  She is/was a Hindu, so most of the concepts are Eastern religion.  Not only that, but she is not a good writer. I am a college English professor.  Her life story is interesting, but everything after that is repetitious, vague, with few concrete examples.  I could not even get through all of it.  I am absolutely amazed that this book got so many 5 star reviews.  There are a lot of people who are being deceived, I guess.  And they must not know good writing either.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie good music and well written and acted movie for guy that hates glee and most musicals this was enjoyable because it was funny and the music is better than what you usally get in musicals.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This film tells the story of 3 little girls who outwit everyone looking for them after escaping from a detention center in Australia.  A wonderful story about the human spirit and the strength of love and family
B0034G4OYA|5.0|the kids love this movie and parents can tolerate a adam sandler movie that he has be making lately unlike his great early work of happy gilmore and the waterboy.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I love the little animation. Some of the words were really hard to guess, at least for me. I did also wish the words wouldn't repeat so soon after you just did it.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Mom loved because it is the classic version and the true mircale on 34. Better than all the remakes that have been made.
1400069807|5.0|I have known for some time the manipulation of taste by the big &#34;food&#34; industry.  This horrified me.  Off the the produce, real meat, real dairy isles.  I have a new cookbook with fresh products and offer amazing taste and is filling.  I am a believer.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|It started out with a bang. Promising very hard core, aggressive story telling with a great deal of possible conflict with the newly discovered Woodbury. If you read the comic book, the Prison vs. Woodbury conflict was one of the richest, and goriest of the conflicts within the comic. Since this is made for television, it would have to be toned down. Toned down, and dummied down, are two different things.<br /><br />Once Rick & his group established themselves in the Prison, it became more of the slow self absorbed plodding story telling that has made the first to seasons somewhat undesirable to re-watch.<br /><br />Granted, the television show is an alternative universe to the comic book, but they could have stuck a little closer to the source material for a more interesting ending to the season, and more interesting story telling overall. It left some dangling plot threads for possible returns of the Governor, and hinted that Rick & his band are going to be living in the prison for a while.<br /><br />This season made me question wether I would purchase the fourth season.
6305781427|5.0|Yanni is absolutely awesome. I have all his videos and DVD's and CD's. Great buy. Highly recommend. He is so talented!
B005BZQTGS|4.0|Not the best movie in the world, but I thought it was funny and just \\"fun\\".  I don't understand all the 1-star reviews... oh well.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Yanni is absolutely awesome. I have all his videos and DVD's and CD's. Great buy. Highly recommend. He is so talented!
0812993845|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is an incredible writer.  Books are always light reading and hilarious!  This one had me laughing out loud!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|First, I just want to say I did like this book. I felt that at times the author put in unwanted details, yet left out important descriptions. I never fully  read a description of the main character. As a visual person that really bugged me and made it more difficult to imagine the characters. The author did a great job but was very bland on certain parts.<br /><br />There are two noteworthy aspects of this book to me. First of all the reason I gave it a 3 was because at times the transitions between scenes was HORRIBLE. It often became difficult to follow, but I only noticed this toward the end of the book which leads me to believe she was just trying to rush through the end and perhaps edited her own book. Second thing to note is Travis,the main character, is a maniac. He is violent and unpredictable, not to mention possessive. While I thought the book was decent he was less than appealing to me and FAR from a typical girls view of romance. I halfway expected book two to be called \\"from behind bars\\" with a plot of Travis murdering someone for looking at her. Gross!
0385342071|5.0|Incredible read!!!  Started it and could not put it down!  Light and funny and completely hilarious! Had me laughing out loud!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I love this application.  Very easy to use.  I love that you can set multiple timers.  Previously I had one Alarm Application and one Timer Application.  This allows me to have one app that does it all!
B009NX2XA0|4.0|A good old fashioned Duke flick.  I especially like the line &#34;I'll be a suck egg mule!&#34;  Not sure what a suck egg mule is but pretty funny...
B00821OX98|5.0|One of things that impressed me was the absence of gratuitous foul language. Nice plot and well developed characters!! Look forward to Season 3!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Nothing can result stop true love not even the ability to turn into a werewolves could keep them apart or could it?
1476734941|2.0|This book has some good concepts and tips.  Unfortunately it was written in the UK.  Therefore, none of the calorie counts are like the ones used in the USA.  Also all of the measurements are in kilos not ounces.<br /><br />There is a conversion code in the back of the book. For me its too time consuming to convert calorie counts and measurements.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|she abolstely loves this pacifier, even everyone is the hospital where she born wanted to know where i got it so they can buy them
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I was impressed at how tough this is to beat.  You can adjust the difficulty setting.  I set it right in the middle and I can can hardly beat the darn thing.  I'm not a great chess player, but I did play on my high school team.  I probably rate around 1000.  Challenging is good.  If it were too easy, it wouldn't be worth it.  So I like this app.  Easy to use.  Crisp graphics.  My only complaint is that there is no way to view captured pieces (hint to the makers).  It's nice to be able to keep an eye on that.  Sometimes I lose track after a few exchanges.  Am I really a pawn up? or am I a pawn down?  I know I can just count them on the board, but I'm lazy.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Loved this movie. I thought is was great, although my husband said it is not a movie to watch if plannning a trip involving air travel.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|WOW!!  This book gave me so many emotions: sad, happy, horrified, tickled...  very well-written and a great reading experience!  Do yourself a favor and read this book!  You won't be sorry!

B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie is fun to watch and Wreck it Ralph is full of a lot of love. I've heard of some kids getting upset by the giant bugs in some scenes so parents may want to consider the child's age and tolerance of bugs.

B0070Y46UY|1.0|I know this is a highly rated book, but I could not get into it. The initial narrative is just too long, and doesnt seeem cohesive to me. It doesnt feel as if it's leading to anything. I'm going to have to go back to it and tray again later. After the first few chapters I gave up.
B00821OX98|5.0|Really enjoyed watchiong Season 1.  Have Season 2 queued up and haoping to finish it before the Season 3 comes out in June 2013.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|I did not watch Lost when it first aired. It was only recently when I was scrolling through my Kindel that I discovered the show.  I'm a Amazon Prime member and I saw that all of the seasons were free so I thought it was worth a try. Now I am on the third season and I am hooked!  I do have to complain that I don't get as much sleep as I use to do to the fact that I keep saying \\"one more episode\\"! It has got to be one of the best shows ever produced for tv. I dread the day it's over
B004FRX0MY|2.0|As the subject line says, I had CD's copied on 2 external drives totaling 18G as well  as music on my C drive and it turned all the CD music on my external drives and the C drive into MP3 files. Now I have to recopy all my music, approx 22G to make CD's to play in my car. I or computer. It had no business changing the music I had put on these drives. I don't like the thought one bit of copying all my music back. They should put someway to convert MP3 back into CD's again. Now if you buy MP3 music that should stay the way it was purchased. Leave original music on the computer alone!!
B0040P6R0S|5.0|for those of you that have never listened to this artist than your missing out on a whole different sound of music and thats exactly what it is.this artists has a sound that rises above anything that i've ever listened to and what I mean buy that is that his music ,sound,rythym is so unique and all of his own.He plays that guitar and it comes alive.this music is something that you wished was still around,its different thats what makes so unique.you will be absolutly blown away when you listen to this.its to bad that he is no longer around to share his music to the all that love his sound.you'll love it,thanks
B005HJU7HA|4.0|You don't rate classic writing that has been around as long as this material.<br />You read it. It's part of one's education and exposure to historic authors.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is interesting to see what the enemy had to endure during World War 2.  Very well written and easy to read.
0061438294|5.0|It seems you can't turn on television these days without coming across some \\"body language expert.\\"<br /><br />No licensing agency verifies the claims of those self-professed experts, so it's no surprise that many of them come across with the credibility of a roadside psychic. I regularly roll my eyes at cable news segments that feature these allegedly wise people who appear to make it up as they go along (but they'd be right to view my eye rolls as a sign of disdain).<br /><br />Reading body language is notoriously difficult. Sure, some \\"tells\\" are more certain than others, but even rather obvious tells usually require other, complementary tells--known as clusters--in order to accurately assess their meaning.<br /><br />That's why I so thoroughly enjoyed Joe Navarro's What Every BODY Is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People. His book is filled with all of the necessary and responsible caveats, but is still an easy read full of fascinating tidbits. Navarro rests his conclusions on the most recent science--his book has a three-page bibliography--but he impressively avoids the pitfall of weighing down the book with dense prose.<br /><br />Navarro, a 25-year FBI veteran, says the face is one of the least reliable indicators of what someone is truly thinking. He writes: \\"Having conducted thousands of interviews for the FBI, I learned to concentrate on the suspect's feet and legs first, moving upward in my observations until I read the face last. When it comes to honesty, truthfulness decreases as we move from the feet to the head.\\"<br /><br />In part, that's because people are taught to lie using their faces at an early age, he says, such as when children are told not to make a certain face when eating a distasteful meal or to pretend they're happy to see an unpopular aunt.<br /><br />Navarro's book does a nice job of explaining the \\"three brains,\\" and why our \\"limbic legacy\\" is responsible for the freeze, flight, or fight instincts that manifest themselves--usually without our knowledge--in our nonverbal behavior.<br /><br />In subsequent chapters, he details nonverbal behaviors from head to toe--or, more accurately, from toe to head. His book also includes almost five dozen short side \\"boxes,\\" many of which contain fascinating anecdotes from his career as an FBI agent.<br /><br />Since I believe every review should take note of a book's flaws, I'll briefly mention that in a few places, I felt that the author stated the obvious. For example, it probably didn't require a full page to explain that attire communicates a message, and that a person in a dark alley wearing a suit will be perceived as less threatening than a person wearing baggy clothing.<br /><br />But that's a small point. Every time I started feeling that the author was stating an obvious point, I'd flip the page and learn three new things. Bottom line? This book is well worth the read. Highly recommended.elves--usually without our knowledge--in our nonverbal behavior.<br /><br />In subsequent chapters, he details nonverbal behaviors from head to toe--or, more accurately, from toe to head.

B00BGIBVP8|1.0|boring movie, no real plot, ending same as begining. will not recommend to anyone. I wanted to watch a romantic comedy, and I found myself waiting to a speedy end.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Its fun for my son and I he asked to get so we can each have a reef we like comparing fish lol .  I like because he can enjoy it but it doesn't require a lot of time.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Here is where it started so if you loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy this is a must see. My only disappointment is that they are splitting this up into multiple movies.  Given the length of the book it is understandable but they should keep it to two movies.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire series, despite the minor technical issues that plagued series from episode to episode (I know geek alert, right?). Anyway, I found this season particularly intense. The crew faced many of their toughest personal challenges as well as the always fun alien of the week that tried to take over or destroy Voyager in some way.<br /><br />The time travel episodes were mostly done well - even though I have my own issues with some of the lines that contradict technical facts presented in previous episodes of the series.<br /><br />This is a solid 4 stars for the season as a whole. The fifth star is because of the final episode &#34;End Game&#34;. I found this final installment to be so over the top that it brings the whole series up. It is easily one of the best series finales I have ever seen to date. Seeing how the crew handles themselves throughout the episode is very well done and the special effects were pretty stellar even by todays standards.<br /><br />Kudo's to the whole cast and crew for a job well done.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|It too a while to tolerate the pilot character, there was much about him to dislike. But you get hooked watching the train wreck unfolding before you. Redemption finally happens near the end and it's good. Well worth watching
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love having a calculator at my finger tips anytime I need one. i have it on my kindle so can use it when I am gathering info from my phone.
B008602KQI|3.0|I understand the director wanted to make the city feel like another world, but the costumes and decor of everything seemed cheesy. As far as special effects go (like the rendering of the city, train, etc) are about what you'd expect from a SciFi channel movie. Overall I enjoyed the movie plot about as much as I enjoyed the book.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Was a great movie executed very smoothly throughout adding humor where appropriate and the special effects were excellent.  Would definitely recommend watching.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|If you like Tarantino films, you will love this one. This film has it all, a love story, revenge, adventure and tarantino's writing in it. Characters chosen for this film were just right and each ones development was both believable and enjoyable. If you are not afraid of Tarantino's style for violence mixed with a certain reality and blood, you should enjoy this film. What I look for in any film is a certain amount of believabilty in the story and how the characters perform and react. This film has all that.
0756665949|4.0|Got it for my wife who is a Lost fanatic. It's very detailed and high quality. She really likes it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It definitely put you there and gets u involved with the characters. I enjoyed it. I did not want it to end.

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This app is awesome!!! although its a portable rip off version of grand theft auto it is still fun hijacking stuff,killing,and playing the missions. I like to play this app alot,especially when I'm bored. warning: there is explicit language,violence, and some sexual activity and is probably not suitable for little kids but it is still fun......
B00A85EMVK|5.0|You already know if you like the movie enough, so on to the 3D, which is what I'm giving 5 (more like, 4.5) stars...<br /><br />Yes, it's grainy. Grainier than the 2D BD but it compensates well for the darker scenes abundant in that one.<br />Yes, it's dated. But, ahead of its time.<br />Yes, it's cheesy/corny/lame LMAO. But, isn't that what we're going for here?<br />Yes, the color saturation makes people look orangy here and there.<br />Can't argue against all that.<br /><br />STILL, I think it is a blast to be able to see this in 3D, even if it pales against better 3D out there. In fact, it isn't half bad, once you get past all the aforementioned. AND, the lossless tracks (it includes DD TrueHD AND DTS HD-MA both 6.1) sound great---man, those songs...C-L-A-S-S-I-C!<br /><br />I got this version because I didn't already own any other version on any media and I'm a 3D fan. On a side note, my son was \\"only gonna watch a bit of the beginning because he wanted to go to bed early for school\\" (he's 18) but stayed through the whole thing in awe! YES, RECOMMENDED IT IS!
B009Y6X65C|5.0|I'm a new fan of Bonamassa's first off, but gosh this music is good stuff! I'm a real fan of the heavy heavy Blues feel and Joe's voice! Give it a listen before you buy! You'll know if you want it!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Reviews had kept me from buying this back when it first came out but I only had the DVD in my collection and I wanted to upgrade to Blu-ray (I love this film and have always enjoyed revisiting it), PLUS I'm a 3D advocate, so I just had to get this version sooner or later.<br /><br />I finally saw it last night and this is one of those instances (at least for me) where \\"an already great movie was made even greater.\\" Of course, it cannot compare against Titanic 3D (a must-own if you have 3D and which ALMOST ALL 3D movies pale against--natively shot OR converted let me tell ya!), but it does a more-than-decent job. So much so that it exceeded my expectations to the point where the 3D had me smiling...many times!<br /><br />It's matted 16:9 aspect ratio adds (rather than detracts from--or so \\"purists\\" say) to the 3D experience in spades. Even I was at first overly conscious about it and at the beginning it was a bit distracting to know that it wasn't OAR, but all that quickly transformed into a very pleasing and more visceral experience (IMHO) which was greatly accentuated by the DTS HD-MA 5.1 lossless sound--another feature which made this purchase all that more worthwhile! It was like seeing it for the first time! Man, that robot (\\"Sonny\\") is soooo well-made (and magnificently voiced by Alan Tudyk)!<br /><br />3D/Sci-Fi/Thriller enthusiasts: add this to your home library, along with Top Gun 3D, sit back and enjoy ;) !!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love crime/drama series. And Castle hits the right combination of comedy, lightheartedness, and mystery. Nathan Fillion is both cute and an AWESOME comedic actor!

B0063IH60K|4.0|Very easy to use on my kindle. Just a tap of a finger will send the card or cards to where they belong.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|In addition to the excellent actors, this was a fine film regarding the sexual abuse which has gone on in prisons and everywhere else for far too long.  It also showed how some of the characters were able to rise above these early disasters and make useful contributions in life while others sunk low and turned to crime.  True reality!
B003G4W49C|5.0|i felt like i was in the book. very easy read and a great time. the movie comes out in nov 2013
B00BI73CVI|3.0|This one does not measure up to the fabulous performances I've seen on stage.  It was rather interesting, however, to note Colm Wilkinson in the role of the Bishop when he was Jean Valjean in the stage production.  Still had a commanding presence.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|great performances by some great actors. the story moves a little slow, but it is well worth watching. Check out the cast list.

B001XV3LSS|5.0|Taken from the book and finished after Dr Sagan's death, the impact of contact with another civilization in the universe and how we might react. The story is set in present day and utilizes very real and possible equipment and people. A must see.
B001GCUO4S|1.0|The original Final Destination movie was original the idea of a bunch of teenagers surviving a horrible accident only to be hunted down and killed by death, fast forward 3 sequels later and we get The Final Destination which is basically the same exact movie. This movie is sadly way to predicable anyone who's seen the 1st movie hence have already seen The Final Destination, apparently people love watching stupid teenagers die in gruesome fashion but the deaths in this movie are as about believable as a bugs bunny cartoon too cartoony and way over the top you can't help but laugh. No one seems to care that there friend are dying so why should we, this is by far the worst of the the Final destination movies.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 6th grader sucked right into this series of books and cannot put it down:-)  So exciting to see her reading again.
B0000DIXDR|2.0|It's really just low budget, badly-acted, soft-core porn.  Surely you have better things to do with your time, don't you?
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a stark and vivid description of the future where the world is united against a common enemy and is in the process of breeding genius children who will save humanity from destruction. Throughout the book, I had to constantly remind myself that Ender was a child. He did not think or act as a child, so it was easy to forget.<br /><br />The character development was deep and complex. There were very few shallow characters, and even those seemed to have a depth that had yet to be plumbed. Motivations were mysterious and rarely completely revealed. Card gave just enough information to keep me intrigued and following the plot, without revealing every detail about the people involved.<br /><br />The story was rich with multiple layers that Card peeled away in perfect timing to reveal a bit more of the vast galaxy he constructed. The directions taken were often unpredictable and always raised the stakes higher than before.<br /><br />If you want a complex, thrilling, thought-provoking experience in science fiction literature, give Ender's Game a read. Even if, like me, you are not a typical reader of Sci-fi or military fare, it will still be interesting enough in concept to carry you through to the end and leave you wanting more.

B00BSBT8M6|1.0|This is now one of several occasions where I have tried to stream from Amazon.  The majority of the time, it does not work.  So, regarding the Life Of Pi, I really wanted to watch it but it became so frustrating every minute or so, I just shut it off.  I'm sure it's a great movie, but I haven't actually &#34;seen&#34; it.  I'll keep trying.
B009X01D9U|5.0|this is a very sturdy and useable case! thick and protects kindle! very pleased and highly recommended by me to all looking for case for your kindle
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Reminiscent of &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34;.  Excellent series well worth watching and beautifully filmed.  Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess is fantastic.  Can't wait for season 4.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a mystery to me why the book is titled &#34;Wool&#34; but its nevertheless, a fantastic novel and chilling idea of what our politicians could do to us.  Reading the whole series (First, Second, and Third Shifts are the  next 3 books) is a must and I can't wait for the final book, &#34;Dust&#34;, to be published.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|What a delightful story to give you hope and purpose again in this day and age of tragedy. Harold is such a normal person, but filled with a reason to pursue his purpose. Well-written with those secrets we try to hide and move on from, yet never can. Harold and Maureen faced their dragons that tore them apart and returned to their innocent love for each other.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is well written and does well with a difficult topic. The author's experience of life after death differs from others because it lacks the normal &#34;interpretation&#34; which is usually present and which in my past reading has made me doubt the experience. (For example, why a person meets only those he knows in heaven. Where is the rest of humanity that one supposes will be encountered in heaven?!)  the author also echoes the thoughts of authors such as C. S. Lewis who refer to the realness of the spiritual realm (cf The Great Divorce).  A wonderful addition to a growing collection of books on near death experiences.
B003XREL98|5.0|Brilliant description of pre-independence India. Characters, especially Anglo-Indians seem drawn from life. Although this book was written and the action takes place, several decades ago, it is not dated. The reader is drawn into events as though they recently occurred, the mark of a masterful writer. Well worth reading.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I played the first temple run a lot and enjoyed it. The second version, IMO has surpassed the first, with more features, better looking graphics and smoother gameplay.

B007BVMVDU|5.0|even better in hd ... enjoyed all episodes ... much clearer in hd ... almost like being there .. going to have to get the other series
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Semi complex murder mystery with good building of characters. Kept my interest and the story line wasn't contrived.  It was believable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a wonderful book for those who may be hesitant to believe in an afterlife or skeptical.  Because the author is a man of science, a neurosurgeon, he explains why in the past he did not believe.  Once the experience happened to him, it became a different story.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.  Quick, short read.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Star Trek First Contact is my favorite of all the Star Trek movies.  The plot moves along, there is never a dull moment, and all the actors are at their best in this movie.<br /><br />There is doubt with Starfleet since he was previously held captive by the Borg, but Picard proves just how human he really is when he offers to sacrifice himself to the Borg for another crew member (I won't say who just in case you haven't seen it).<br /><br />The desperation to make things right in their future shows in every crew member, and all of humanity depends on the Enterprise and her crew.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|To meet this is Daft Punk's best album.  It had the massive hit ONE MORE TIME but that's not the best song on the album - there are many others that are just as good.  Recommended and really spot on good.  Great album for a party - put it on and select repeat.  DONE!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I really roasted the book from which this television series was taken, mainly because of its poor writing, many grammatical errors, needless and endless descriptions of meals and wearing apparel, and episodic structure, which destroyed dramatic tension. As it turns out, what didn't work for me on paper works spectacularly on film. This is probably the most well-done television series I have ever seen, with casting and production values equal to almost all theatrical offerings.<br /><br />The episodic structure, typical of soap operas which follow multiple characters and story lines simultaneously, works well for screen writing, particularly when viewed in a collection like this instead of in week-to-week installments on television. The casting is extraordinary, for the most part, particularly for the actors portraying Eddard Stark and the dwarf Tyrion Lannister. Only one major player, the actress portraying Cersei Lannister Baratheon, does not seem to fit the part as written in the books, being too hardened and old looking and not nearly as creepily depraved as she should be.<br /><br />As in the book, completely unnecessary and graphic sexual scenes are introduced with some regularity. As I am an older female, rather than a young susceptible male, these all seemed to be rather more humorous than titillating, and seemed to cheapen the storytelling somewhat by sensationalism. This aspect may discourage some parents from sharing this with their older teenagers, which is unfortunate, since many would certainly enjoy it.<br /><br />In an age when most of television is reality garbage, I applaud HBO.
B00BBW16HW|1.0|I couldn't bring myself to keep watching this melodrama. Bad acting mostly, filled with stereotypes.<br />Yuck. Yuck,yuck, yuck,yuck, ( I needed four more words and these were the first to come to mind.)

B008OE05IG|3.0|Wasn't for me.  I liked the story of hard work and learning more about the craft of sushi and the work it takes, but for me there just wasn't enough meat on the bone to make the story stick or to draw me in.

B003297I1U|4.0|This is a great truck; it takes a licking and keeps on ticking. My 4 and 3 year old sons have not been able to destroy it yet. The only thing I wish it did was stay together a bit easier. The hook on the cable kept getting pulled out so often that the boys just wanted it left out and then some of the other attachements (like the lights) seemed like an afterthought. They didn't fit in well and didn't stay put.
0374530718|4.0|Bought this book to help my daughter prepare for the AP World History exam.  Written as a novel, it is rich with content and is an enjoyable read for older children or adults.  Worth having on your bookshelf and re-reading periodically.
0812971825|4.0|Beautifully written story of a minister struggling with grief after his wife's death. His mother swept in to take his infant daughter, leaving Tyler Caskey and his troubled five-year old daughter to fend for themselves except for the weekends visits in which she criticizes Tyler and insists that he remarry. Tyler's congregation offer no comfort either but treat him as a source for the gossip that distract them from the sties in their own eyes.<br /><br />Elizabeth Strout is a master of terse, sometimes biting prose. Though the storyline seems grim, it's never depressing. It builds a quiet power as Tyler first fears he has lost his calling, then begins to find his foundations. Strout presents characters honestly, leaving judgment to any reader who can't see themselves in the flawed people of her beloved New England. I read this right after Olive Kittredge, and it was a lovely companion piece.
0761163808|5.0|Fabulous gift for a kid, my grands and nephews and great nephews love this book. It's money very well spent.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Worth watching to give some perspective about Bin Laden killing. Unfortunate too much focus on the lady investigator. Mostly drama, some torture scenes, a bit of action.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been using AccuWeather for over a year now.  The accuracy is refreshing.  I love the detail provided; especially with the recent updates.  The app is simple to use, more accurate than any meteorologist on television, and generous with the details and personalization ability.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|As a bond fan all bond moves are a must watch, and i hope for 5 stars.<br /><br />While this move is entertaining and has enough action and plot, I can't give it 5-stars and it's not the best bond. It's definitely worth watching but for a bond move just lower your expectations a little.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful  but sad, hopeful that tragedy of children's lives can find love and joy.  It is despicable that the Catholic Church is responsible for such nightmarish horror forced on innocents.  I will hold this story of redemption in my heart forever.  Thank you.

B00B23O96A|5.0|461 Ocean Blvd, Another Ticket, Pilgrim: all different, all excellent. Layla was a hard act to follow and it won't be equalled but this album is remarkable.  One day you will be 60 or older and this music will resonate, you will be in Sun Valley Idaho in October listening to professionals sing such ballads live ten feet from your seat and you will tingle. There is enough guitar to excite you and the the clear, heartfelt emotion of Eric's voice will render you spellbound.  Another Dylan-like step into musical excellence. You cannot anticipate or appreciate  that which has not yet been heard or experienced.  Dig it, bigtime.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|It is for sure very violent but it probably serves a purpose, slavery was real and the movie makes you see with a chocking sense of reality what it may have been.... It is nevertheless an epic and modern western like movie very entertaining and even funny

1881273873|5.0|Many years ago, I read the original Five Love Languages. It was intended for couples, but many singles read it as well.  However, some people don't seem to realize that love is something you have for your family and friends (even co-workers!) as well, not just for your other half.  That's where this book comes in.  It does include a section on boyfriend/girlfriend, but mostly it applies the five love languages to ALL the important relationships in your life and shows how a loving attitude can help promote peace.  I have three copies of this book (one in English, two in Spanish), and although I have a few copies of some of the other versions, it's now the only one I loan out.

B000002IZ4|1.0|STP is one of the top three bands of its genre. Sadly, like those others, they do not have remastered albums. They need to remaster, at the least, their first three albums. As does, Soundgarden and a few others... or I won't waste my money, playing music that sounds faded and muffled compared to the rest upon a playlist.

B008CLI4N4|1.0|I tried the books and they were the most poorly written schlock from a purely technical standpoint. Which was a pity, because the story was intriguing, although the attention to gruesome detail was not necessary. The HBO series has been so talked up and highly recommended -- however, the best thing about this first season was the introductory music and computerized building of the cities and lands. The rest of it was frankly appalling. Apart from what I would call pornographic presentations of sex, the battle scenes and the expected results of battle were poorly done. I've seen more realistic anime. Two thumbs down.

0547564651|4.0|I got this book out of interest and as I have a five year old daughter.<br /><br />This book is interesting, useful, but not complete. However there is more than enough in it to strongly recommend it to other readers- especially if you have children, or are involved in teaching them or creating social policy around them.<br /><br />It has an excellent opening section on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) and their effect on future development. The eight main ones are:-<br />Physical abuse<br />Sexual abuse<br />Emotional abuse<br />Social and emotional neglect<br />Divorced/separated parents<br />Family members in prison<br />Family members with mental illness<br />Family members with addiction problems<br /><br />For myself and my daughter I was relieved I hadn't given her any of them! Thinking more broadly I thought of how many children I see in my practice in my medical practice in a mixed area of Halifax who have experienced these problems. My experience seems similar to that of Dr Nadine Burke Harris (paediatrician) in California and Dr Dozier (teacher) in Chicago. That feeling that \\"the best tools available to them in their chosen professions were simply not up to the challenges they faced\\" rang true to my own professional experience. The more adverse childhood experiences a child has the more the workings of their stress systems (principally those controlling cortisol and adrenaline) get hardwired into their psyche and social functioning. Psychologically this over-activation of our stress responses produces observable psychological effects which may include wary children, who lack self control, will not defer gratification, have little sense of the future, and often have low self-esteem. Disadvantaged children are growing up with a high stress (allostatic) load, and it has huge long term effects throughout their lives. They can easily end up living living in Hobbes's nightmare world described in [[ASIN:1619491702 Leviathan]] of \\"In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\" The chronic stresses reduce the development of the pre-frontal cortex which leads to poor executive function (making poor choices, often on impulse) poor concentration, reduced ability to learn, inability to regulate emotions. In short the convergence between the neuro-scientific view, the psychological view and what is seen in nurseries and class rooms is well mapped out.<br /><br />Cognitively the outcome of such of such conditions is impaired IQ development (less overall intelligence) and less ability to use it. Successful children (and adults too) have some intelligence, but also show curiosity, persistence, self control, conscientiousness, self confidence and grit. We all have varying degrees of these characteristics. High intelligence is useful- and indeed you can get a long way through school and work life on it- but the ability to use that intelligence well counts for a lot too. This book constantly emphasises that it is intelligence plus the other characteristics working in combination that best predicts success. At some level character is the ability to have intelligence and to to have the meta-cognitive ability- of knowing how to use it well.<br /><br />Children who are developing well tend to be confident, curious, better able to interact with peers, able to bounce back from setbacks, calmer, more self reliant.<br /><br />This book describes and evidences this well, and also shows some of the effects that can be achieved when measures are taken to reduce the long term effects of early ACE. There's some optimism, some pessimism, and much real life example in the account Tough gives. For those working with disadvantaged families and children there is much here to help our thought and action. For those of us in more stable middle class settings there's encouragement to keep going- but no great hint on anything extra to do- and perhaps that's a useful message for many middle class people- it's enough already, and we may not need to gild the lily further- just keep it fed and watered and with some sense of an overall purpose to life. (What Antonovsky describes as developing a sense of coherence in [[ASIN:1555420281 Unraveling the Mystery of Health: How People Manage Stress and Stay Well (Jossey Bass Social and Behavioral Science Series)]]<br /><br />The book then goes on to describing how older children can be helped to develop. It gives some remarkable examples, principally of how some challenging children learned a lot through learning to play chess at a very high standard (winning national competitions in USA) The story of how the teacher patiently works with these children, and teaches them how to slow down their impulsivity, to step back from the board, and to really think about how and what they do is inspiring. The question is left whether the techniques learned around the chess board can map across to their general scholastic activity is less clearly answered.<br /><br />This book is basically arguing for balanced development of children, and for creating a context within which they can do this. The African proverb, \\"It takes a whole village to raise a child\\" summarises this idea.<br /><br />There's a lot in this book, and it gives good context to the debates around child rearing and what helps and what doesn't. It's a book more about overall context, than about help for individual children and parents, or direct child rearing practices.<br /><br />As a society what it documents about social disadvantages and their long term impacts is important knowledge, and politically we should be acting to mitigate these early disadvantages as much as we can.ng term effects of early ACE.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!! I would definitely recommend this to a beginner in gaming! :D The first time that you will play this, I swear, you will be automatically glued to the game!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|What can I say?  KEVIN BACON !!  on my TV each week - YUM !!<br />The plot is interesting too (LOL) - Glad to hear it has been renewed<br />for Season 2 ...

B0010SKUYM|4.0|Good writing style, vast vocabulary, needs improvement on story structure. Character development needs work too. In general very good novel for the first try.
1452115567|5.0|I'm completely in love with Maddie and love this book sooo much! Couldn't wait for it to arrive and as soon it did, I took the time to sit down and give it my full attention. The photographs are the BEST and I really enjoyed reading the introduction too. Coolest project ever! Theron and Maddie rock!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best Bond yet, great fun with digital copy.  Great quality as expected. Extras do bring film into new era.  Must have!
0385349947|5.0|This book struck me as an honest and well-researched exploration of gender issues in the workplace.  As a male leading a mostly female team, I took away excellent tips on how to build a culture of truly equal opportunity that adjusts for behavioral biases that are deeply entrenched in men and women.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a great game. Absolutely worth the $1.99.  Can't wait to see more from this developer. Great fun. I recommend to everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room has me completely engrossed. I am in the middle of the game and I am playing slowly so it doesn't end too fast. I'm getting bored with hog and point and click, but this one gives me hope for the genre.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I usually don't believe the hype of a good show but this stands up. Each episode is like a movie that keeps you interested until the end. I dare you to watch the 1st episode and not stay with it.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|For the first time ever, I'm disappointed with a Michael Buble CD.  Nothing stands out...sounds too commercial and it sound like he's going through the motions.  It's not bad, but he was at his best earlier in his career concerts and albums.  Take a break and come back strong!  Whoever is picking your song choices as far as covers should be fired.  2nd song sounds too much like \\"Just Haven't Met You Yet.\\"  Reese Witherspoon of all people to duet with?!  Come on...best song is the last one.  I found myself thinking how much better the originals are a few times.  Not paying for a concert this year...
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My 4 yr old enjoyed it enough to want to watch it again, which isn't saying a lot but he was quoting the movie which shows he not only watched, but paid attention to it.
0060574216|5.0|I had always heard about this book, but never had it in my collection. WOW. How inciteful. A must have marriage manual or ANY man/woman relationship be it family or the work place. NOT a book to just read, but more of an actual reference book to be referred back to and skipped around in depending on the situation.
1452115567|5.0|Great book, awesome photos! I think a lot of us wish we could just let go and do what Theron Humphrey did. Just leave it all behind to travel (with a Coonhound) and meet new people and see new things. Gets me daydreaming................

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I love this guy! I love this movie! If you haven't seen this one yet and love an action packed movie, you will not be disappointed!
B005HED08I|5.0|IF you're not a Star Trek fan...read no further.  Otherwise, the remastering process is phenomenal.  I love the cheesy acting, the characters, the plots.  All of it is ahead of its time.  RElevant for today.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Gotta love Daniel Craig and love this movie! Though I am a fan of most of the Bond films, this one is &#34;tops&#34; in my book!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have nothing negative to say about this book, series, or author.  I don't care how meandering the story goes, the longer the better!  I had the feeling that he could have wrapped up the story in this book but I'm happy enough that it keeps going.  I have become completely obsessed with all things GOT, boring my family and friends with details from the books.  I even called my boss &#34;my Lady Amanda&#34; and my dog is Ser Scrappy, lol.  Also subscribed to HBO just so I can get a fix until the next book comes out.  I recommend this series very highly!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|After reading &#34;Beautiful Creatures&#34;, I was slightly disappointed.  Too much running around and not enough story line.<br />Some scenes were a little vague.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I don't normally buy a BluRay to replace a BluRay of the same movie, but this time I made an exception. And, man am I happy I did.<br /><br />This review is on the Remastered 2013 vs the original 2006 BluRay:<br /><br />I never complained about the old version because it was so much better than the DVD and, being a 20yo, low budget movie, I didn't think it could get much better.  Well, it does. I just finished watching the Remastered version, followed by the old one; I can see major flaws after viewing the newer release. The 2006 copy is softer, flatter, has plenty of flecks of dirt throughout, and highlights tend to be blown out. All of this has finally been fixed.<br /><br />The sound is pretty much the same, which is clear and active, but with some of the surround elements a bit louder than I think fits. I spent a lot of time turning up the sound when normal talking occurred, and turning it back down when the chase scenes or flashbacks happen as the switches make my wife jump. Neither movie has a mono track included. I don't mind, but some have complained.<br /><br />Bonus features are exactly the same (and in SD), so don't expect anything new.The one change I didn't like was that now there's no main menu screen. The movie starts immediately and you have to use the pop-up menu to bring up choices (the older version went to a menu screen first). This is OK for the most part, but when playing features, it goes right back to the movie as soon as that bonus feature is done playing. It's not a deal breaker, but it does bother me.<br /><br />Personal opinion: If you have an average TV & the old BluRay, this is probably not worth an upgrade, as you may not see much of a difference. If you have a high quality big screen, you might want to get it because you should see a big improvement in clarity. Both are better than the DVD, but the new one is head and shoulders above it. Don't upgrade for sound as the 2006 release sounds great & the 2013 isn't any different.<br /><br />Hope this review helps./>Hope this review helps.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This caught me from the start of the book. There was no boring beginning to get through and it was hard to put the book down cause you just want to find out what will happen next. I would recommend this book for anyone who needs alift in their outlook on LOVE and human kindness. Ending is so heart felt.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip Phillips is a breath of fresh air. What a wonderful talented young man with a HUGE future in front of him. A true artist.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this! It is a powerhouse of emotion. The compassion toward a an orphaned child of another race is the most beautiful act of kindness! Her self-image is absolutely incredible. All the women are strong, kind, resilient, and face adversity every moment of every day. The love relationships are strong, passionate, and sensitive. The horrible acts of brutality are sickening, yet make the story what it is. Remember, we are talking slavery.
B006VGGAC4|3.0|Fascinating life of a pretty impressive guy.  When you keep in perspective that he has done so much on such a high level for such a long time, he really has no contemporary in American popular culture.  Having said that, the book can really bog down sometimes.  When you are interested in details and real dirt, the book sidesteps it entirely.  Also, don't look forward to to him dishing much dirt or showing much insight into his own short comings.  I would suspect that anyone at his level has to be pretty self-involved and self-indulgent, but he never really owns up to it, and seldom shows much real insight into his bad choices.  Does family mean a lot to him?  Yes it does, apparently, but don't expect him to talk to much about it in anything other than a self-serving way (he spent more time talking about a cigar factory in Cuba than he does about any of his children).  Regardless, it was not a bad read but it could have really been pared down.

0307476073|5.0|After reading some of the reviews of 'Wild' on Amazon.com, I am amazed at some of the criticism. It seems that some of the most negative criticism is directed at Cheryl Strayed as a person and at her past rather than a critique of the book, its style, and subject matter.<br /><br />Not all characters are good, and certainly none are perfect. All characters are not created to be liked or loved either. This book is NOT fiction so this character was not created out of thin air. It took much courage for Cheryl to write this book, opening her past, telling stories from her past that she admits she is not proud of. Based on some of this criticism, are we supposed to look back on our lives and only tell the good stories? Are we to embellish what happened so that it all appears as good?<br /><br />In my opinion, honesty makes for a great story, especially when someone is able to reveal all that they have been through. Also I believe it shows great clarity and focused observation to be able to recognize that you did things you now regret and know were wrong. There are many things in my past that I am not proud of. I certainly do not have the courage to share them with the world. But I do believe there is a certain growth one must achieve where you can recognize your past missteps and try to make amends with anyone that you may have hurt along the way. Additionally, by living through these times of pain and difficulty, you may become a better person in your present and future.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because I myself went through somewhat similar circumstances around the same time period and almost at the same age as Cheryl. I wish I would have done something like hiking the PCT. It may have saved me years of working through personal issues having not experienced the scenery she encountered. I always yearned for a journey of rebirth. Cheryl did exactly that, which made this book very enjoyable for me.

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|This movie built gradually up to the final takeoff and escape from Iran.  Thinking back on the times, it was very disheartening to witness the complete and utter failure of the Delta Force mission that followed and was well publicized.  It's nice to know that at least some people actually escaped the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's invasion of the US consulate.  On the other hand, the need for secrecy with the ARGO mission was well documented in the film.

The Killing Floor in my estimation was one of the better novels.  I have not read all but have read quite a few.  Child is a good writer but some of the subject matter(mainly the content and theme)  does not interest this reader. I chose books written which will peak my interest.  Still I like the fact the Reacher comes out winning and  most underestimate his abilities.

B00136NYR6|5.0|Many reviews have called this 'the best album of all time' the 'defining album from the 60's' 'The most important record of all time' That's all so true.  There's not much else to say that hasn't been said. This records impact on rock music and all songwriting of any kind since it's release and American culture is so enourmous that it's hard to even estimate. Kids hearing this back in the day were mesmerized and there simply was nothing out there to compare it to.

1451695195|4.0|Many of you will want to compare this book with the little missive &#34;Heaven is Real&#34;.  This is a different idea on near death experience.  This one is from the view point of a Doctor and therefore his &#34;scientific mind&#34; had to be convinced that everything does not end at death.  He knows from his medical education that you can not think or have any mental activity when you get to the level of brain damage he was receiving.  His change of heart having survived brings a strange and different telling of the near death experience.  We all need to hear these stories and reinforce our belief in the next world.<br /><br />Dennis Endicott

B006RXPUR2|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  Mostly unpredictable and very taught thriller.<br /><br />The lead actor and actress show the real level of life in South Boston, or any white lower class/ethnic neighborhood.  The bar as the local meeting place and doing business and life.  The cruel level of poverty and drugs that is not redeemed is an important theme.<br /><br />When the players try to manipulate the out come of justice, and a straight arrow, no moral compromise man undoes this attempt, the old system takes over with no change and the victim is the one punished in the end.<br /><br />Great story of do-gooder getting it wrong.<br /><br />Dennis Endicott

B006IVBSBU|4.0|A good look at the progression of an epidemic, and how the behavior of people becomes the truly uncontrollable danger in so many different ways.<br /><br />The way it develops reminds me of the stages of hypoperfusion (or shock).  The human body, and metaphorically, the human race too can compensate for a time before the system reaches a limit and spirals down, with every compensatory process contributing to the damage now instead.<br /><br />Not a typical movie, but if you're digging virus/zombie/infection movies lately, check it out.

B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Really good movie. Reminds me a lot of the film The Woman In Black with Daniel Radcliffe. Mama is not a film i would consider \\"Scary\\" , but be mindful that, Mama does have its moments. I really admired and appreciated the pace of this film because so often horror films are really fast paced, that sometimes you can miss a key element or important plot point of the film. At 100 minutes I was expecting a quick,predictable movie. I am glad to say that is not the case with Mama. This is one of those RARE films that second after second, I was anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. And THAT my friends, is a good thing. Jessica Chastain (being one of the better known stars of this movie) did a really great job as Annabel and the two young girls in the film, Lily and Victoria (Not known what their real names are) are absolutely splendid in Mama. The remaining supporting cast all did exceptionally well. And The Direction of this film is one of the best I have seen in quite awhile. I will not spoil any details of the story line, but if you watch this movie you are in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />4 Stars

1451668945|3.0|Half-stars aren't possible, but if they were, I'd bump up my rating by an extra half. But going up to four, unfortunately, just wouldn't be an honest appraisal. Within minutes after starting, I almost stopped; the whole thing seemed extremely simplistic, with a few things that just didn't add up.<br /><br />One of the first characters who's introduced, Kate, lost her mother in a boating accident when she was just three years old. Not long after that, a younger sister, Hannah, appears in the cast. Huh? How did that happen? She was only three, and there was no mention whatsoever of a sibling - just interaction between Kate and her distraught father. Only later did I learn that her sister was eight months old at the time their mother was killed. So who was taking care of Hannah during the funeral?<br /><br />The story really starts when Kate is seriously injured and hospitalized in intensive care following an explosion at the antique furniture company originally started by Kate and Hannah's grandfather that's now run by their father. Killed in the explosion was a long-time employee who had been forced to retire and was openly unhappy about it; and since Kate had dragged him out of the wreckage before she succumbed to her own injuries, it was clear they'd come there in the middle of the night together. But for what reason? Were they actually victims of their own attempt to destroy the company?<br /><br />After that, new characters keep coming fast and furious - two young women who have been missing for years, for instance - each with a different background and a different set of relatives. As the story moves along, they all become intertwined. And of course, we also meet two young men with ties to the others that seem destined to serve as the requisite \\"boyfriends\\" for Hannah and her attorney gal pal, Jessie (Kate, it appears, is left out in the cold in this regard, but then she spends most of the book in a coma so I guess that's a moot issue).<br /><br />It does all come together in the end, complete with what I suppose is to be a big surprise. And it all makes sense, really - except the feeling I was left with is that the ending that was determined first, and the rest of the book was contrived to fit the way the author wanted it to end. The characters somehow didn't seem totally believable (nor did some of the situations they encountered; there were just too many coincidences, and I'm not much of a believer in coincidence. The whole thing isn't a bad read - fairly enjoyable, in fact - but it just doesn't quite come up to the Queen's usual standards.<br /><br />Sorry.me together in the end, complete with what I suppose is to be a big surprise.

B00AYJCEYC|5.0|If you love Michael Bolton's music as much as I do, you will say it's about time he had a new CD. This one is great.
B008QYT7DI|2.0|The Kindle version has limitations! I am only able to read it on my iPad2 using the app, it will not work on the Kindle Touch. In the drop down menu of the product description it says which Kindle devices it will work on, however I did not notice that, so I was disappointed! It also has highlighting disabled, text to speech disabled and lending disabled. These are decisions made by the publisher (i think) which I hope they reconsider!!!<br /><br />The artwork, which is reminiscent of the original is in very low resolution and is blurry. I do not have a retina display iPad, so maybe it looks better on a retina display, but I doubt it. While you can pinch and zoom the image, it just gets bigger and blurrier.<br /><br />Oddly I also could not create a bookmark for a page where I left off reading! But maybe that's the iPad app, they've updated it so much maybe they took bookmarks out. Who knows?<br /><br />The book is wonderful, I did not mind the new translation (but if you are fond of the older English translation, be aware this is a new translation!)<br /><br />I like the Kindle experience, but since publishers have their differing standards it is a hit or miss proposition when purchasing a Kindle book! You may not get the full Kindle experience. That is why I gave this version 2 stars.

B003IY48PS|2.0|To me, the Blu-Ray is inferior to the dvd for a few reasons. It's too grainy. I don't know if it's just my cheap BD player, but the quality was way too grainy. It got to the point where I put in my dvd copy of this, and it was better. When I watch a blu-ray, I expect crystal clear quality. Another thing is that there are no special features, except for a commentary. The dvd has behind the scenes footage, poster gallery, and trailers of the movie. I would not recommend this blu-ray of THE EVIL DEAD!!!

B0025KVLTM|5.0|The first few months of 1967 were quiet ones for The Beatles, both literally and figuratively. They were no longer a touring band and 6 years of playing almost non-stop and spending hours promoting themselves and their records was over. Their last new album, 'Revolver', had been released in August 1966 and there had been just a couple of singles since then. They'd even stopped doing radio and TV broadcasts. Their profile, once so high everything they did made national news, dropped to the point that only a column or two in the music papers referred to them. Other bands were making the music news, though nothing like the days of Beatlemania. Had The Beatles' time at the top passed?<br /><br />Then Sgt. Pepper was released and the world was filled with the sounds of the Summer of Love- crystal clear, perfect pop music, tuneful, happy, optimistic; the world as it should be in one magical package. The brilliant and utterly fascinating cover, by far the most famous cover in all popular music, held a collection of songs which would become famous even though none of them was ever released as a single. Why was it, and why is it still, so well-loved?<br /><br /> Although 'Sgt. Pepper' is often referred to as a concept album (and it is) to my mind the concept it represents is usually misunderstood. The songs don't relate to each other musically, except in occasional cases. They are separate songs and have been recorded many times as individual pieces of music. 'Sgt. Pepper' is a concept album lyrically and in its mind and spirit. It epitomises everything that is good and exciting about life, even in the most unlikely cases. The music reinforces the mood of joyousness; it's impossible to listen to the album without feeling happy. The Beatles succeeded in capturing a mood and giving it a tangible expression. The Word, as one of their earlier songs said, is love.<br /><br />The album starts with a rousing introduction- the band is going to play! Brass and guitars behind McCartney's powerful vocal and the band's unique harmonies. The title track announces this as an upbeat night, a night when everything will be for our enjoyment. Gradually the band fades away, to allow Ringo, in the guise of Billy Shears, to sing his song. This is Ringo's best vocal on any album and the theme, With A Little Help From My Friends, is not only positive, but makes it clear we are all his friends. The call and response format brings us all into a cosy, intimate world.<br /><br />The psychedelic 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' follows, wonderful, happy images. Has there ever been a song with a more uplifting title? Imagine being in the sky with diamonds! It's like a marvelous dream from which you don't ever want to wake up. Whether LSD was the point of the song I don't know, but if it was then it was the ultimate good trip.<br /><br />McCartney's trio of songs, 'Getting Better', 'Fixing A Hole' and 'She's Leaving Home' follow; my one quibble with the album is that 'Getting Better' and 'Fixing A Hole' are too similar in style and tempo to be next to each other, but that's a minor matter. All three songs are positive and optimistic and they all have the same theme; the world can be a better place if you make it so. There might be those who say that 'She's Leaving Home' isn't such a positive song, but when you analyze it, it's just a glimpse at a situation most of us have faced, when a child becomes an adult and sets off to make his/her own future. There's some sadness for the parents, but young people must make their own way at some time, and there's no reason why it shouldn't all work out well for everybody. The girl loves her parents, she leaves them a note so they won't worry and no doubt they'll get over it- after all, maybe they'll soon have grandchildren! The girl is happy and excited and that's the ultimate message of the song.<br /><br />'Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite' takes us literally to the circus- wasn't that one of the most exciting experiences ofour youth? The glamor of the performers, the smell of sawdust in the big top, the bright lights and raucus music, all captured here in John's tribute to a childhood highlight. A splendid time is guaranteed for all, indeed.<br /><br />The mood changes to something more introspective for George's 'Within You, Without You', but the feeling is still positive; the last four lines give us all hope.<br />'Peace of mind is waiting there<br />And the time will come<br />When you see we're all one<br />And life flows on within you and without you'.<br /><br />Paul follows with two songs giving a happy spin to subjects usually treated as to be dreaded; old age, in 'When I'm 64' (remember, he was 25 at the time and I was 19- now we're both over 64!) and street parking enforcement in 'Lovely Rita'. Parking meters and parking meter inspectors, usually women and nicknamed 'meter maids', were relatively new at that time and often the subject of derision, but Paul makes his meter maid desirable and fun. This turning of subjects on their head is magical- great and imaginative lyric writing. If you thought lyrics weren't Paul's strong point, listen to these two songs and their subject matter and see if you don't change your mind.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, John chips in with 'Good Morning, Good Morning', taking a dull day and turning it into an exciting evening out. As with so many of John's lyrics, this one is episodic rather than sequential, but you can feel the mounting excitement ('Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.<br /> Go to a show you hope she goes') and the music is vibrant and energizing. It ends with the symbolism of a hunt, and the cluck of a chicken turning into the first note of the 'Sgt. Pepper' reprise.<br /><br />The show's nearly over, but there remains the masterpiece of the album, the great Lennon/McCartney collaboration on 'A Day In The Life'. Lennon's ethereal singing, McCartney's brisk interruption, bringing us back to earth until again he drifts off into a dream; the stunning orchestral climax before the bridge, and the final crashing chord gradually fading away- amazing and unlike anything else ever recorded. \\"I'd love to turn you on\\" is Lennon's message, and the band does just that.<br /><br />The album represents a shining moment in pop history and in western culture; a brief period when anything was possible and the world was there for everyone to discover how wonderful it was. It didn't last, of course; it couldn't. Soon reality would intrude and even The Beatles would not be able to show that all you needed was love. But the album remains, still the most popular album ever made and the pinnacle of achievement for the best band ever to exist.
1455113549|2.0|Although I usually love listening to books on tape, that was not the case with Defending Jacob.  When it came to the primary character, Andy, the voice actor reading the book was all wrong.  He sounded much older and stiffer than a contemporary suburban dad of a 14 year old son.  The audio voice was never believable and that was distracting throughout.  (The voicing of the other, more minor characters, was fine.)  I mention the audio issue first because it may have been a factor in my overall lack of engagement in the story.  Maybe if I were reading a printed or electronic version of the novel I might have felt like the plot developed more quickly but on the tape, I just kept waiting to get excited or feel some suspense.  I never did.  In addition, with the exception of Andy's wife, I found that I cared very little about most of the characters.  I never got to know them.  I would have been fascinated to know what Jacob was thinking but that was never revealed.  I love this genre but cannot recommend Defending Jacob as a good read.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I should stay straight away that I have not read the book and I suspect that the film-makers have made the assumption that people who watch the movie will know the story. As a result the setting up of the Hunger Games is perfunctory, with no real justification for the annual sacrifice of 23 teenagers and no indication as to what is achieved, other than a TV show. The movie comes across as a combination of 'The Truman Show', with the Games taking place in an artificially controlled environment, and 'The Running Man', with people being killed for entertainment purposes.<br /><br />Having failed to set up the movie, the problems are then compounded by making so many of the scenes longer and less productive than is necessary. Other reviews have suggested that the story is all about relationships, but the movie isn't. There's far too much emphasis on the features of the actors and not enough storytelling. Ms. Lawrence might look appealing, but that simply isn't enough to carry a movie. Since the film clocks in at almost 2 1/2 hours, far more should have happened than actually does.<br /><br />I saw the movie on the big screen and again on DVD, where it was already among the bargain buys. I thought I might find more in it the second time, but if anything I found less. It's a slow, confusing and ultimately not very good movie.

B001KT6JPA|2.0|Hannibal Lecter has supposedly exquisite taste.  He likes the finest foie gras, the best sweat breads, and the tastiest Chiantis.  Well personally, I would rather have a good Amarone myself.  But I'd also prefer a movie that doesn't ridicule the paying audience.<br /><br />This film is surely grotesque, but that is far from its greatest weakness.  The over-the-top religious imagery, reminding me a bit of the original \\"Carrie\\" -- which I reviewed not too long ago -- made me weary.  Dr. Lecter lecturing on Judas Iscariot betraying Jesus, and then showing Judas later hanging while being disemboweled from a tree; Dr. Lecter being carried by a forklift to his final \\"meal\\" as if he has been crucified; etc. etc.  From what I remember, early in the film, I believe that Starling says something like, \\"Dr. Lecter considers himself to be a savior figure.\\"  Yeah, right.  Savior if you like going to an early grave, I suppose.<br /><br />The theme of this film seems to show the dangers of revenge and greed.  Well, unless you're Hannibal Lecter of course.  After all, he can exact revenge -- or work as a proxy to exact revenge for his \\"buddy\\" Starling or anyone else that he finds \\"worthy\\" -- and then it's all OK.  The strength of the first movie was that the director kept Dr. Lecter at arm's length.  Here, they bring him in too close, and no one in his or her right mind would get as close to him as some of these characters do.  So to me, the weakness in this film goes all the way back to the screenplay.  I believe that there were many flaws there.  But it could be argued that even making a sequel was simply in poor taste.<br /><br />And this poor taste brings up an interesting question:  If Dr. Lecter has such great taste, what would HE think if he watched this movie?  I think that he would say something like, \\"Tsk tsk.  If you can't have good manners, I might send you to the kiddy's table.\\"  But I might say, \\"Why send it to the kiddy's table?  How about if we just put it out in thebackyard and use it as compost.\\"  But that doesn't even seem to be a very tasty proposition.

0061726834|5.0|A great start for this Dystopian Trilogy! I really enjoyed this book. Lauren Oliver creates this Dystopian world of love-less-ness. No, that may not be a word, but it best describes how I interpret this book.<br /><br />  I was hesitant to buy this, despite the great reviews. I read good and bad reviews before I buy a book. I read a few whereas the book is slow paced. I think all Dystopian books that have sequels should start out with as much detail as possible. I for one don't like to read books that give no meaning behind the events. So, yes, I rather enjoyed this slow build.<br /><br /> Lena is an amazing character. Not in the sense that she's all confident, but that she believed what she thought was the truth until proven otherwise. I'm glad she wasn't rebellious and reckless just for the sake of the story. I'm not for spoilers, but this book is amazing. I just started Pandemonium this morning and I'm almost done. Worth the read!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The sections describing the lives of the orphans were heart rending, but the other parts of the story were most enjoyable. Some parts made me laugh out loud.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|No Spoilers here. So relax. The films Total Recall and the Matrix had a baby, and it's name was Oblivion. I really enjoyed the action, sleek visuals and mind-bending concepts introduced in this film. Can I wish for a better developed version of Morgan Freeman's character? Might it have been better if we had  split this epic into two or three films? I wish they had made a graphic novel first, to work out the plot problems, before taking this to film. There's no reason why this film could not have been this generation's Star Wars, but it fell markedly short.<br />It felt like they had trouble squeezing so much ponderous material into the standard less than 2 hour format. And yet it is the mere existence of such ponderous material that I found so refreshing.<br />Worts and all, I loved this film, partly out of a nostalgia for a time when science fiction was for grown-ups; and a time when it was okay to trust that your audience is intelligent enough to appreciate deeper themes and subtexts. We, the science-believing,<br />mankind's-ultimate-fate-pondering crowd, will pay good money to see more movies like Oblivion.

B000QDA7OU|5.0|I used to watch this movie when I was young and we started talking about it at work. This is such a great movie and Audrey Hepburn is timeless. It will not disappoint!
B008RLTUUA|4.0|This book is a good, thorough examination of a scandal that we all suspect is there but can't quite quantify. You'll never let a doctor prescribe anything for you after reading this book. And you'll be right to take that stance.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and each time it is funnier. Watching this was such blast from the past!
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This is not about the movie, cuz I didn't see it. Yes, I rented it, but couldn't watch it on the plane cuz I left my earbuds in my checked luggage.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, who checks luggage? Me. I do. So I didn't watch on the cross-country flight and the movie expired. Did I get a refund? No. So now I'll never know if it was good.<br /><br />Feel sorry for me? No? Well, wait till it happens to you.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I have read and/or listened to ALL the Jack Reacher novels. Hollyweird could not have picked a worse actor to play Jack Reacher. This movie sucked. Jack Reacher is still The Man. I will need to work very hard on getting this visual of Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher out of my mind!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Facebook interface not slick. Has cool pictures. Hope you set it up right from the start, cuz if you don't I couldn't tell you how to customize after.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|..Loving it so far .  colors are very vivid  .  Graphics are nice love it love ok yes yes yes. Keep up the good job
B004VMUS9G|3.0|works well enough.<br /><br />So I still have to type in 17 extra words. Now I only have to type seven more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Greatly entertaining to observe the different behaviors between the family upstairs and the family staff down stairs.  I wish the season was longer!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Considering all the fun my little daughter finds in this game and considering this was a free download, what can I say. I love it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Hernan
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest, needed for my Kindle. Great to download from Amazon and I can take Pinterest with me wherever I go.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game. I am totally addicted . I play Spider everyday. I play on the computer, on the Kindle, and on my smart phone.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love Twitter, needed for my Kindle. Great to download from Amazon and I can take Twitter with me wherever I go.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|didn't realize I had missed so many episodes.<br />sometimes had trouble with WII reconnecting during viewing.<br />Good story line.  Stopped watching when had to pay for episodes.  Already paid annual price. Won't pay more.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|The CD showed up new and worked fine, no issues with excellent picture quality.  The price was the lowest online.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Four stars why? The plot is not that spectacular. The pilot of the show was brilliant, wildly inventive, well acted for the most part.<br />The reason why I would give this show four comes down to &#34;Harvey Spector, Louis Litt and the pot smoking apprentice. Louis Litt I found especially appealing and authentic in his own weaselly, ingratiating and venal way, chased with a side of self awareness and jabs at redemption. Spector comes across as one dimensional- the episode where he meets up with a lost love I found totally unconvincing. But still, the panache with which he delivers the biting sarcasm of some of his best lines is oiled smooth precision and that doesn't come cheap. As for the apprentice, whose name I forget, the portrayal is honest and as sublime as one's going to get in the show. For the rest of them, pretty much cutouts with plot lines well confined to the specifics of a law office, I presume. Knowing atmosphere flows pretty well on the show, also.
B005SAV9SO|3.0|Seems like everyone is trying to get in a role they do not fit..while it had a few funny moments..it was &#34;Ive seen this before&#34; Kind of movie. Never will be a Horrible boss movie thats for sure.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Honestly to me the book was no comparison for the movie-- which is odd because usually the movie isn't up to par. But the book was a very good read, just very fast and straight to the point. I never found myself worried about the characters or anything and the story line was very bland. It was pleasant but I believe Gaiman has had better works of fiction.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|I am a Monique fan through and though..but OMG this woman showed she is more then just a funny chick that can throw cut downs...This movie is excellent!!!! I was off my feet yelling at the TV..if your sensitive about abusive parents avoid.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It's a show that's well written with an excellent story line. I feel connected to the Characters. Every season provides great entertainment.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|I believe I just seen this movie with Justin Timberlake? Same old script, same old ending, just different characters. I gave it 4 stars because it was still a good movie.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I really enjoyed Les Miserables and the acting was excellent.  I watched it twice and my roommate and I both enjoyed it.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were fantastic, though Anne Hathaway's part was a very small part of the movie as a hole. It was raw, but we knew that the director made them sing live before turning it on and I was in no way disappointed in the result. Despite some fairly intense criticism, Russell Crowe did a pretty good job as Javert considering his usual singing is with his mate's in their band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, which is the only other time I've heard him sing and it is pretty much a local Australian bar band.  He's an actor, not a singer really, but it's not like it hurt to listen to him.  Just sometimes he looked like he was trying so hard.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hunger games was an outstanding movie for my kiddos. I read all the books with them, and if you have not read the books, your missing out on a lot..though they get slow..it helps the movie out even more. CAnt wait till November for #2
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty good game. Doesn't take much time to beat. The puzzles are relatively challenging in the beginning but they become easier the more you do them. Graphics are pretty impressive considering its made for hand held devices.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|What to expect when expecting..has been done over and over again, however it was still pretty cute! Rebel Wilson is such a odd ball funny girl. Decent movie to say the least. But if you hate watching a movie that reminds you of others..then avoid.
B000FA675C|5.0|Since I've had kids in 2006, i've probably read about 5 books from cover to cover.  And it usually takes me weeks to get through one.  With The da Vinci Code, I was done in a day.  Very fun page-turner to read.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|As a fan of the Firefly TV series, I absolutely LOVE this movie! It is fast-paced and has some unexpected twists and turns. Plus, it was great to see the cast of Firefly back together!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great insight into what it is like for many of our soldiers who lay their lives on the line fighting for our freedom in the recent conflicts oversees.  Not only the risk to their own lives, but also the sacrifice their families make as well.  I have always had a profound respect for our service men and women, but this story has elevated that to an even higher level.  Thank God for Mr. Kyle and those like him as they really are a great example of the awesome people that the United States produces.
B00985E3UG|5.0|A must read!  After seeing the data in this book, I doubt if I will ever again enjoy all those fun food commercials!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like it, but I am still learning all the differences between it and regular solitaire. It is almost as much fun.
1452115567|5.0|I bought this book because Theron and his ideas, stories, and thoughtfulness and a million more awesome things make me not only happy but inspired! I love this book and the stories within, some told and some left to be creative with. I enjoy going through this book with my.family, laughing and all the most greatly appreciating the love put into it. (especially because we are dog lovers ourselves, and i am a wannabe future travel lover!) :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to physically relax, but still use your brain in a non-stressful way.  Solitarie has always been a favorite of mine.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Watching this movie I learned about the man behind the 'quotes'.  The settings of the movie were spectacular! Although it was long, it took the time it needed to tell the story.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Since I loved reading the Wheel of Time, I figured I would read something from the author who finished the final books.  This was the first one by Sanderson that I read. Lots of details about a world that inhabits beings that are both similar and completely different than our own. Very enjoyable and looking forward to reading more from this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book; had a difficult time putting it down - it keeps your interest.  Really enjoy the characters and will purchase the next book to keep reading!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun but the pacing does feel a little slow at times. This game challenges the gamer to think and plan ahead. The graphics and animation are very good along with sound effects. I do recommend this game.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME it is so fun to go on adventures and to fight monsters and my personal favorite the creations but it would be better if ores were more rare
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Keeps us interested the entire show!  We cannot stop watching it.  Everynight we watch a new episode! Thanks for sharing!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I just had to read this book because it's been on the NY best seller list for MONTHS! I think it was a great story, well written with lots of shocking scenerios. But it wasn't a book for me. Not to give anythign away...it kind of just ended and you hate the ending...at least i did. It didn't seem right. BUT, then again it was a great book where the only thing i thought about was reading and finding out what happens, so i guess that is why i gave it 4 stars, but i hated the charaters in the end so i couldn't give it 5 stars, but hating the charaters might just be my opinion...i wouldnt be their friends or like them, but others might. So i recommend reading it, but i know i'll never read it again like i do other beloved books!!
B0076DELIG|3.0|In fact, it's been dormant on my iPad since mid-February (it's now March 24). I purchased it to read during a flight from New York to Tokyo.  It was such a slow start, I stopped reading after the first couple chapters.  I'm also annoyed that it appears the publisher is using bigger print and wider margins to lengthen the novel. I may be wrong. Michael Connelly is my favorite crime novelist.  I hope when I finish reading this book, I'll feel deep regret about what I've just written.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|I loved this movie, I can never say anything bad about Twilight! I, of course, bought the original Blu-ray version but i also bought this with the extended 7 minutes of footage, i know people say they are just ripping us off, but i dont' care. I like having both versions and having the options. Well worth the money for me...which i think that the reason they put this new version out is for Twilight FANS. I'm happy they did it, hopefully there will be a version for all the movies, i'd buy it in a heartbeat!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|good scenes and map helps need decent tutorial to get started for clear understandung  good graphics and music along with a story
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I will purchase the DVD for this! It's funny, i thought the singing was good and the idea was hilarious as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show! Excellent acting, a new legal case each episode and characters that are believable. Drama at its best! Give it a try, you'll be hooked!
0446554995|5.0|I truly enjoy the Pendergast series of books. This one was so exciting. I was so stressed out at times I had to put it aside. The action and storyline is so intense. Very enjoyable read!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a really fun game, yes it starts out as free. But once you start playing you have to buy the game and it really is additive! !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's nice to have an ongoing series that is so refreshing and fun to watch.  The different drama keeps it exciting.  I hope this series goes on and on for a very long time.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The only downside is it takes a lot of battery juice quickly.  also the challenges seem too far and few between.
B0019K06WM|5.0|All good. thanks!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The first one came with the kindle fire HD and is great for that device.  When used with a good charger (like this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CG2ATQ/ref=oh_details_o02_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) it speeds up your recharge time dramatically on devices that can handle the juice.<br /><br />I tried to get the cheaper 6 foot cord from amazon but it's not nearly as fast.  Highly recommended...
B00BF11STU|3.0|This was interesting but I was looking for a better portrayal of the whole team involved on the intelligence side.<br />It wasn't just the woman who worked this important case.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This movie was unexpected, and cute. I hate christmas and all that hoopla, but this movie provided an interesting spin on the holidays and my daughter loves it. The 3D is more about depth than popping out at you so that was a bit disappointing, but the movie was enjoyable enough I wasn't too bothered.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I love this series!I just absolutely love the Selection. While, I enjoyed the Elite very much,I think the selection was better. I did enjoy learning more about the rebels and the history of the monarchy. But I do feel this book was all over the place, I wanted to scream at America in this book, she kept making bad decisions and could not pick between Maxon or Aspen. The love triangle in this book was dragged on far too long. I would have like to have had more conversations with America's family, particularly between May, America and Maxon.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! It did bother me that America wasn't worried about Aspen and her parents being at the Halloween ball together with Maxon. Wasn't there a possibility that Maxon could overhear them saying Aspen's name? The conversation at the end with Aspen was basically the same exact thing she said to him at the end of the Selection.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book. I'm crying right now that I'll have to wait another year to find out what happens.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Loved the show.  I will keep watching it.  Hope it continues on like the first show.  Maybe a few off coloured things but all in all a great show.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|At first the plot was a little slow, but by the time I got into the story, it was hard to remember that I wasn't one of the characters. Having Park`s perspective gives such a good comparison to Eleanor's, especially since he seems to be so much more open with his affection. Overall, this was one of the best books I've read this year. I highly recommend it.
B009MVM09W|5.0|The Cohen brothers are pure genius and the Hudsucker Proxy is one of their very best. Thoroughly enjoyable movie for the whole family.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I enjoy the game but it doesn't grab my attention like others have.  Difficult to understand how to get from one level to another.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I am a singer. I am able to record the song I write on here and use them for future reference easy to use.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I loved the first book, I really did, despite the weak politics. This book builds on those politics, strengthening them. But, honestly? I have enough of the whole female emotion thing in real life. Girls are crying constantly in this book, one scene after the other. A little much. The boys are torture and you just want to rip them to shreds half the time. Perhaps that's a good thing. But America? Too wishy-washy! She has strong morals, but she truly is just a dumb seventeen-year-old girl.<br /><br />Kiera Cass truly is a good writer, with weak points only in some of her descriptions and her build-up of the world. I guess I'm just looking for less reality, less drama. Enjoyed it enough to still buy her next  book though!
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Love this new album . it is their best album yet. every song is infectious and I cant get enough of it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is great, i love each character. I only started watching 2 yrs ago but i have seen every episode atleast twice now. I really love this show, so much fun to watch
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good acting, good intensity. We really enjoyed the show. I remember this on the news when I was a kid, and watching the movie helped me remember the people and the history.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great story. Action packed but still with heart warming messages. Very good acting from some great actors/actresses that carry even the slowest scene, which there aren't many, with an exciting pace.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|such a good movie, there is something for everyone. not sure its appropriate for kids but really entertaining. &#34;may the odds forever be in your favor!&#34;
B004D1CK32|1.0|I don't know why I picked this movie. It is definitely not worth your time and money. I could not finish watching it,
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Gave me the chills and made me laugh. Very political and makes good points about today's global community. Good read.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|Don't waist your time and money on this movie. It is horrible! I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes into the movie.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I really loved this movie and can't wait for the sequels. Just wished I had a bigger tv to watch it on!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great moving, great quality, loved the story line. Very futuristic yet realistic as to what might happen in the future. Loved the characters and the costumes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a very fun game it is awesome and its cool. Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb deferred the thing that I love is that there is no point to the game you can keep playing it forever:)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|a good game over all. plenty to do in each senerio. nice graphics although the mouths are strange when the men are talking. I would recommend it to other hidden object gamers.
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Untouchables and although now that movie sometimes feels a bit cheesy this one really has a modern feel to it. The acting is great and the action is awesome. I would really recommend it. I have to say I like it more than public enemies.  Definitely worth the rental.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie is just awesome.  Can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug.  Too bad the trailer for the next movie wasn't included in the special features.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book. Wow! It's so great and fabalous author. You guys should read this book or watch movie. This book is more story then the movie.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Wish the series would continue with Season 6 and 7!  Season 5 needs to be on Amazon Prime as well!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT ACTION MOVIE THAT SHOWS RETIRED IS NOT DEAD. IT ALSO SHOWS YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S LIVING NEXT DOOR.
B008XG1X18|5.0|didn't really know what pinterest was until my sister introduced me to it.  I can easily spend hours checking out different ideas.  Be prepared to get lost in others(or add your own)  creativity!!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|The rest is history I was able to burn the movie file to a DVD and play it on my TV DvD player and record it with the VHS side of my Tv too.
B000JMKNV0|2.0|I did not enjoy this book.  It was confusing and difficult to follow.  I hope the movie was more clear.
B0000524EM|5.0|Had it once before and love the booklet that comes with it. Crow is one of the best movies of all time and only those who see the truth in it can truly appreciate it
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy always is on top of current events.  Watch the news to see that most of what he wrote is happening.  Sometimes too much in depth.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I have had the cover for 2 weeks and the paint is chipping off of it already!!!  The stand works nice.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Change your life from one bad habit to one good habit at a time!  Our brains learn to work on autopilot....amazing!
0679804021|5.0|Another perfect book for my grandson ... right on the money for his reading level and he can use this one for school as well.  Thanks!
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|this was unreal fun but was haooppy tto watch not all the time can watch it  it was ok ok to wow soem aoprts
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Very entertaining and thought provoking show. Highly recommend giving it a go. You will find yourself both grossed out and totally sucked in.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|What can I say, if you like movies such as Gladiator, 300, Spartacus etc.....this show is for you.  This show is action packed!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Excellent! Always love Robert DeNiro and Bradley Cooper. Glad to see more attention payed to mental illness. I have seen in my own life how mental illness affects the entire family. This story was so much my life growing up. I have watched two members of my family struggle with insanity. Would like to see more attention payed to this issue especially as it relates to recent shootings. It is not just about gun control. education is the key. Mental illness should not have such a stigma attached to it. No one chooses to have this brain disease.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a great game.  The puzzles are difficult but great fun.  There is something to solve every other turn. No your regular hidden objects game.  FUN!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Jennifer is good, the story is decent, the bad guys get killed...but the best part of the movie is the great North Carolina scenery.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I watch the NCIS shows weekly.  Due to a TV breakdown, I was able to not miss it by using Amazon.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|portrayal and development of characters very well done, plot is intelligent, great for boomer audience and professional women of any age
B00BF123WG|3.0|I was a bit disappointed by this film because it seemed to drag a bit. The final 20 minutes or so were thrilling and well done. I, personally, would have taken some &#34;poetic license&#34; and shown the &#34;in the compound scenes&#34; without the night-vision effects so as to better portray the action. I don't know why there was so much controversy re: the &#34;torture&#34; scenes (no political statement, however, many said they were inappropriate). If anything, I thought the &#34;torture&#34; (notice the quotes) was mild (given the situation and the importance of intelligence-gathering). I didn't observe any real torture (not that I was hoping for it in the movie). Overall, a pretty good film but a bit overrated and drawn out. Argo was a far, far better film.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|The thing that Maiden fans know, and what the detractors don't is on full display here....besides being a terrific live act that spend the money to wow the fans with all the bells and whistles, the members of Iron Maiden are all excellent musicians.<br /><br />Splendid from beginning to end! Up the irons!!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies! Very well-done and excellently filmed. It shares some good philosophies (without getting too preachy). Good action, heart-warming story. The cinematography was outstanding! I streamed this through my Roku (from Amazon Instant video) and was very, very pleased with the HD, the sound, and the stunning cinematography.
B00C90T4QK|2.0|This is the first album by Michael Buble that he simply doesn't deliver on. The only songs that I've enjoyed listening to are 'After All', 'Have I Told You Lately', 'It's a Beautiful Day', and the Toy Story song 'You've got a friend in me'. Save your money and only buy the singles.
B00BR476TG|3.0|The TV ads made this look very tempting, but the preview didn't impress me much.  Not a movie I would pay to view.
1616614609|5.0|The learning curve for this one may turn some people off but the payoff is a very deep, well thought out experience. While the theme with a lot of games feels a bit \\"thrown in,\\" it permeates this one and you really start believing you're in this futuristic world of hacker vs. corporation. You're probably going to keep the rulebook nearby for your first bunch of games, and thank goodness for being able to search cards/rules online quickly during a match, but it always feels fun and the more you get used to gameplay the more fun it becomes. While there's obviously some luck involved because it is a card game, your decisions are what will get you those tasty Agenda cards and ultimately victory. It's surprising how many actions you can perform on a turn, and while it feels like very few actions are ever wasted, it never feels so tense that it stops being anything short of a great time. I've never played an asymmetric card game or had an experience like this and I absolutely love it. I look forward to many more games and exploring some of the expansions.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a good book for all women to read, especially the young ones who are just starting to get involved with men.  This is a story of a young, beautiful and caring woman who  got involved with a man who liked to be in control and &#34;take care&#34; of his girlfriend and who later became his wife.  When he drank his dark side would emerge and he would strike and beat his wife and blame her for all his shortcomings.  No matter how &#34;good&#34;she was she was never good enough.  She lived in fear and was slowly being totally dominated. Finally she gets enough courage and leaves her abusive husband and hides in a small town where she meets a young widower with two small kids.  The book shows how these two finally get involved and develope a loving relationship.  But like all abused women the abuser is never far behind as he tries to locate her and get revenge for her leaving him!  The ending has many twists and turns that make this book a page turner.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Enjoyed reading and looking forward to reading whole series. Would recommend this series to those who like reading series books
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|perfect movie, everything in it's right place.  Ms. Honey is so lovely. She could teach me a few things... for realz
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Until last week, I had never seen Treasure Planet.  I'd read TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson and loved it, even if I prefer KIDNAPPED and think it is criminally underrated compared to its more famous sibling.  But my personal collection of children's movies tends slightly to the girlier side of the spectrum.  (And I did see Titan A.E. in theaters, which came out about the same time, I think.)<br /><br />But I bought Treasure Planet when I saw it for a good price because I thought it would be a good movie for my nephew.  He comes from a family of women so basically all the pop culture that gets passed on - books, movies, toys - is more geared to little girls.  I think he's getting a great deal of exposure to female role models and won't grow up to think being a girl is bad.  Heck, his favorite movie is Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />There are some excellent female characters in Treasure Planet.  Jim's mom is only in the movie for the beginning and end.  She's pretty cool though - a single mother running her own business.  And Captain Amelia is fantastic.  She's professional, but caring.  She's competent and willing to listen to other people when they know what they're talking about.  She doesn't put up with false flattery.<br /><br />Jim is pretty similar to Lilo (from Lilo and Stitch) in temperament.  A little angry and wild, hurt and frustrated by the loss of a parent.  But Jim is older than Lilo and starting to face real consequences for his youthful indiscretions of trespassing.  When he finds the map to Treasure Planet, it's a real opportunity for him to get some experience and discipline.<br /><br />If you're familiar with TREASURE ISLAND (or even the Muppets' version), then you know the basic plot of Treasure Planet already.  It's a good plot, filled with adventure, betrayal, and redemption.  I do like how Disney animated it.  The blend of computer and traditional animation doesn't always work.  Some parts really pop due to clearly being made with a computer, but I'm not sure that effect works for me.  (I'm looking at you, space whales.)  But other bits, like John Silver's automaton arm, work beautifully.<br /><br />I think Treasure Planet is a fun movie.  It's rated PG and skews slightly old for my nephew, who just turned three.  There's an upsetting death of a sympathetic character, but I knew he could handle it due to his reaction to Mufasa's death in The Lion King.  Some kids might be upset by the song sequence that reveals Jim's father walked out on his family.  On the other hand, I think Treasure Planet is a great choice for kids growing up outside of the nuclear family structure.  (And it would make a great double bill with Lilo and Stitch.)a computer, but I'm not sure that effect works for me.  (I'm looking at you, space whales.)

On the other hand, I think Treasure Planet is a great choice for kids growing up outside of the nuclear family structure.  (And it would make a great double bill with Lilo and Stitch.)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very different from the movie, which I saw first and loved, but still very good. Tears as I am typing my review.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This re-boot is built on the chemistry of Cumberbatch and Freeman. It is an awesome thing. Brilliantly written, beautifully photographed. Lush!
B001H9JBW6|2.0|The writing contained too much misdirection that frustrated the expectation of things to come. It overall moved very slowly like a soap and that doesn't mean others aren't going to like it, just that I did not. The plot is thin and lacks intrigue.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Fun movie. Wish there wasn't so much foul language, especially coming from children, but a great, classic movie that everyone should see at least once.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the convenience of checking my facebook while using my kindle.  Now I can check out a status/picture without logging into my pc.
1433532778|5.0|The bible itself is made with great quality that will last me for YEARS!  It's hard starting with a new bible every five years because you wore it out.  This one will last.  The content is superb with explanations and helps that actually help you understand the scriptures.  It's theology and content is middle of the road so any Christian, regardless of church backgroudn, will be able to appreciate it.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun, and the achievements make this a game you play for hours straight! I would recommend this game for tablet not phone. Because there is a game mode that is exclusive to tablets.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed this book which described the &#34;journey&#34; of Cheryl Strayed as she found her inner peace and strength through facing an amazing challenge. A really good story well told.
B00881PTRC|5.0|this is a cool game and it is a lot of fun. you who think this game is $99 it is not it is 99 cents but I got it for free
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book!  The end was a little contrived.  Overall it was an excellent and fun ride. I recommend this book highly.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Even though I had read Team of Rivals, I found the movie largely incomprehensible and boring.  Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job with not much to work with.  The movie ends up as a boring and unconvincing cliché.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|I predict Grimes to be the next world star—with the same originality and purity of self as Jay Z.<br /><br />Her style is explosive, her voice is addictive and her music is impossible to stop.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|if it weren't so satisfying.  Great game - levels becoming increasingly competitive through the story with the occasional respite.  Great colors, nice graphics, nice storyline.  Definitely a must try!
B00138KE5Y|5.0|Great music and collaborations with artists, fun listening!  Timeless music, great for all ages to enjoy together.  Highly recommend it.
B008220DGE|5.0|The director's excellent reputation apparently went a long way toward allowing this brilliant and original film to be financed and distributed. That a film this bold could be made today with a big budget and top actors restores my faith in commercial American cinema.<br /><br />It's not a remake. It's not made for teenage boys. It isn't a slight variation on movies we've seen a thousand times. There is no one else quite like Joaquin Phoenix's character in contemporary film and he nails the portrayal of an angry damaged misfit in a way that makes him immediately true and richly evocative.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film to look at, but is also a film rich in ideas, a film that asks a great deal from the viewer, but whose themes will resonate, provoke and challenge long after the credits roll. It does everything a work of art should do.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I would like a zombie show, but this one is one of the best dramas I've seen in years. I'm hooked. But, pissed off that AMC only produces 16 shows a season and I have to wait six months for its return! October 2013 can't come soon enough. Live Long and Fight Hard.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game is a lot like bejeweled.  It's fast paced and fun, but like many other reviewers, I find the ads after every game extremely annoying.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|Thought it was going to be hard like the single Blood, but was quite surprised to hear how versatile Maria Brinks voice is
B0031207RA|5.0|I went this route to mount two RAM mount bases on my 2012 Ducati 848 Evo Corse SE motorcycle. The suggested RAM mount base for this bike according to rammount.com ([...]) didn't work, as the upper ball was too tall and hit the left side of the fairing when you turned the bars.<br /><br />I mounted each one of these RAM-B-367 bases on the top screw of each calliper clamp. The M8 screws included with this are too big for the Ducati however. It takes M6 screws, the same one's provided with the wrong product suggested from before ironically, [...] The 40mm x 6mm screws from the RAM-B-309-2U work perfectly.<br /><br />Here is an image of the final installation of two of these mounts on my Ducati using each 40mm x 6mm screw from the RAM-B-309-2U for each ball: [...]
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|I am biased I LOVE anything SS or Slipknot, but I love hot SS has changed and grown as a band. I always love the last album thinking its my favorite, until the new one comes out. They are like a fine wine!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fine acting, good character development, beautiful photography, intriguing story lines.  I will definitely be looking forward to the next season!
B00A3T5CGU|4.0|i wanted something to replace the tomtom when i was out of the car or in another car and so far this does the trick
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The original \\"Let It Be\\" album from 1970 was a hot mess.There,I said it...it was lacking.Guess what? nothing Paul does forty-plus years later will make that much of a difference.<br />  This album is definitely a better album than the 1970 version of the \\"Let It Be\\" album.<br />  All in all,\\"Naked\\" makes for a solid remix album.But Paul,it's been over forty years,leave it alone.\\"Let It Be\\" will never be as essential a Beatles album as say \\"Revolver\\",\\"Pepper\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\".<br /><br />P.S. The REAL version of \\"Across The Universe\\" can be found on Anthology 2.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|who cant use a walking dictionary? it is great to have at your fingertips and it was free! so why not?
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|The plot didn't require such an excess of rather explicit sex scenes (soft porn?) and it was not expected. Use caution if viewing with grandchildren present!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|i learn about so many subjects on this app, i check in with ted at least 1-2  a week to see what is new.
B001V5CIHQ|4.0|A little cheesy at times, but overall a great movie to enjoy with the family. It's bittersweet and heartfelt as all first loves always are...
B0088P2A7A|4.0|although very subjective; i do like the wikipedia and its helpful to have on hand to check a subject, easy to use.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved this book enjoy stories about vampires and all mystical creatures this book keeps your attention right from the beginning loved all the characters and they became real and I'm worried about Matthew and  Diana & the rest of the both Families I already ordered shadow of night can't  wait to start reading it recommend this trilogy to everyone
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|i prefer the angry birds apps better to this bad piggies but i got this for free and so i still use it now and again.
B009GX69RK|5.0|My favorite part of the week is on Tuesday nights and getting to watch this show! :) So glad I can find them on Amazon since Fox website makes you wait 8 days to watch a missed episode
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What a climax to an already engaging series!  I salute the author for keeping her readers engaged through an entire epic adventure.  The Twilight series is definately highly reccomendable.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great movie, futuristic impoverished theme that gets you rooting for a girl who may lack social skills but maintains her humanity through such demanding requirements.  Enjoyed this movie.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Love the series but missed DVRing the last episode.  So glad to have found it at Amazon and LOVE  my new KIndle HD.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|LOVED this movie!  Cute love story, great music & so so laugh out loud FUNNY movie! I absolutely love &#34;Fat Amy&#34;!  Her one liners are a constant with our family!  The greatest character in the film, loved her!  A couple of scenes that I would like to see omitted (due to genre it's directed to) bologna Barb & having a guy in shower scene.  Otherwise a great movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Very good show. Characters are supportive and and depth.  One of the best shows available.  Make more shows like it
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I saw this movie without knowing anything about it and it was great. It has become one of my favorite movies and I can watch it again and again. When I show it to friends they can't understand why it got bad reviews. No one I know dislikes it and everyone hopes for a great John Carter 2, 3 and even 4. I can't say enough about this film. It's great for all ages, to see it is to love it.
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|I purchased the game. It supposedly downloaded, it just won't open.....I was looking forward to playing the game....what's up with that?
B002XTXFU8|5.0|My heart goes out to Charlie Bronson, I think Tom Hardy really captured the heart of the man. Let's face it he did become famous and that was really all he ever wanted and I believe he wanted a woman to love to go along with it.
B008133MDK|5.0|While I am a die-hard fan of Sherlock Holmes as originally written, this wonderfully crafted modern spin on our enigmatic crime-fighter is a joyful testament to the power of Conan's original writings.<br /><br />The acting is stellar, the writing is fresh, and the staging is superb. It's a fast and furious, rollicking good time! Smart, gripping and funny. Sherlock coupled with modern technology - a winning combination!
B007G5K066|5.0|What a cast, what can I say about the case, every actor in this film is a legion and when you gather those kinds of talent you could only come out with a really good movie. It started a little slow, but once it picked up pace it was brilliant.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I have bought all the big bangs series already but my husband lost one of the disk from this season so I re-bought it and it is prefect great buy
B00BHO70L0|5.0|What's to be said about the \\"Evangelion\\" franchise that hasn't been already? It's a classic, it redefined what we expect from anime, and it set a standard that arguably no mecha anime has even come close to touching. But what a precarious position this puts the reboots in, then. Should we treat them as a separate entity, unrelated to the original franchise, and thus something new and fresh? If so, then Hideaki Anno's original 1996 classic and its brilliant follow-up, \\"End of Evangelion\\", have already been surpassed. With \\"Evangelion: 3.0\\", Gainax has bested itself and turned out one of the most groundbreaking, brilliant films ever created. Shocking, jarring, and powerful, it's a tour-de-force that simply cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Picking up fourteen years after \\"2.0\\", the penultimate entry in the \\"Rebuild\\" series starts off with protagonist Shinji waking up from a mysterious coma. The world has essentially ended, the Third Impact NERV tried so desperately to prevent come and gone. However, all is not lost. Most of Shinji's old \\"friends\\" have reformed into an organization dedicated to destroying NERV, and preventing a Fourth Impact, which would harvest the souls of every living being on the planet. Torn between old alliances and his commitment to NERV, the young man holds the fate of the world in his hands, then fumbles it in a dramatic fashion. Will he come out triumphant, or will he return to cracking under the pressure like he historically has?<br /><br />While there's a lot left out of the above summary (no spoilers here), I can assert that as a long-time franchise fan, this entry did not disappoint. It is the first complete divergence from the source material in the \\"Rebuild\\" series, and as such, it was the more decidedly risky project. After all, Gainax is tampering with characters we've known and loved for almost two decades. Thankfully, it pays off dramatically. These interpretations of the established cast are positively brilliant, and I daresay a vast improvement on their past depictions. Seeing hotheaded teenager Asuka as a somewhat haggard 28 year-old is fascinating, as is becoming acquainted with the conflicted and emotionally-scarred Misato, now the captain of a large flying battlecruiser.<br /><br />The biggest improvement upon the original story, however, is the character of Kaworu. Originally around for an episode or two, and made a bigger deal by the yaoi community than he really was, the young man has officially become a fleshed-out character. He is no longer a one-dimensional deceptive pretty-boy; he is complicated, his intentions ambiguous, and his care for Shinji's wellbeing truly genuine. Unlike his original version, I seriously cared for him in \\"3.0\\", and what he goes through was seriously traumatizing to watch. Hats off to Gainax for this bold narrative decision. There are other characters who become more important, as well as the introduction of characters only mentioned in the first series, but I'll leave those as surprises for viewers.<br /><br />Animation-wise, the film is dazzling, with artistry on-par with giants such as Studio Ghibli, and excellent usage of CGI that blend seamlessly with the 2D characters. The EVA units themselves look great, with more attention paid to their inner workings and mechanics than in previous entries. Special note should be paid to the climax, in which viewers are introduced to a new \\"EVA Unit 13\\", which is one of the most creative mechanical designs to ever grace the franchise. From action to simple scenes such as Shinji and Kaworu playing the piano, the operative word to describe the work put into this film is \\"big.\\" Everything about the production values is larger-than-life, and it is truly one of the best usages of money ever sunk into a film.<br /><br />Wrapping it all up is the exceptional soundtrack. Instead of playing it safe with established songs from the franchise like the past two entries, \\"3.0\\" decides to play with viewer's expectations. Aside from brilliant new compositions, the score sometimes starts off with the familiar strains of a famous piece of background music from the series, then blends it into an entirely different piece altogether. It really helps to establish this as its own individual thing, and it's nice to see even the composers embracing the fact that this is a new, experimental piece.<br /><br />Everyone involved, really, should be commended. When compared the original series, this new interpretation and its predecessors improve upon it almost every aspect. When compared to most anime coming out these days, it is head-and-shoulders above the \\"competition.\\" No matter which way you slice it, Gainax has crafted a new masterpiece. \\"Evangelion 3.0\\" is a powerful, thrilling and occasionally traumatizing thrill ride, and something every anime fan should experience. It has forever changed my standards for anime, and I know that it will be hard going back to other things being released in this day in age.<br /><br />Ironic, really, that \\"Evangelion\\" has, in fact, become the new \\"Evangelion\\" for this generation...<br /><br />Overall: A+ (Masterpiece)illiant new compositions, the score sometimes starts off with the familiar strains of a famous piece of background music from the series, then blends it into an entirely different piece altogether.

B005NPCUC8|5.0|Love this album, great group, good music, haunting, and classic for all time. Undoubtedly one of the best music groups ever.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It has to be one of the best shows on television. I would recommend this show to anyone wanting to watch a movie
B00846REIS|5.0|Third time reading this book. I can't get enough. Each time I read it I find more to love!  I am in awe of this complicated love story.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|My wife has been looking for &#34;TraIn&#34; cd's and has not had good luck.  She finds this cd very upbeat.
B0063M22QO|2.0|it only has one game to play.  I keep getting the same pattern.  After I complete it, a note comes up and wants me to purchase Mahjong II which I did.  I might as well purchased Mahjong II to begin with.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Cool plot, and smart execution.  Also, an unusual cast of characters.  Reminds me of a bit of the Boston Legal, crossed over with NYPD Blue and Law and Order.  You'd enjoy it.  I'm watching 5 episodes a day to catch up!
B009IF82SK|4.0|I had begun to feel that Big Bang was getting stale. It was a lot of the same kinds of jokes over and over again, and while it wasn't mocking the geek community like I had originally thought when the show aired, it was just kind of growing tired. However, this season focuses more on the female leads, and I think that's really helped rejuvenate it for me. It's still very much a traditional sitcom in most ways, but by having the women be the more interesting/relatable characters who ground the eccentric men, the show has been a lot of fun to watch again. It also helped that I waited until near the end of the season to watch it, and we were able to watch most of the episodes serially instead of in weekly installments--I think that helped, too.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|My 3 year old Grandson downloaded this one before I knew what he had done. He didn't know what he had done either. We haven't played it.
B007ZJDGXC|3.0|The cliches that are there are done pretty well.  In the end, though, there's nothing to take this movie over the top beyond the level of decent spy thriller.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|The end was a bit contrived but interesting until then.<br /><br />Lots of coincidences like Elmore Leonard but not as good.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase after all the negative reviews.  It seemed the developer read the earlier reviews and there is no longer an extra charge for the &#34;bonus content.&#34;  I was able to play the entire game and bonus chapter with my intitial 99 cent purchase.<br />As others have written, this is a solid hidden object/point and click adventure game.  It has the typical setting of a creepy abandoned carnvial with a scary clown.  I enjoyed the HO scenes--there is a zoom but I didn't really use it too much.  What I really liked about the game were the mini-games--there were some clever ones thrown into the mix besides the usual &#34;move the tiles to uncover the picture&#34; or &#34;align the rings to open the door.&#34;  Great game and pretty long for the price--I finished it in a few days playing for an hour before bed each night.  If you like Enigmatis and Stray Dolls and other similar games you'll enjoy this one.
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|puppet sex scene is  hilarious.  great price.  wanted to own this one for some strange reason.  truly a warped masterpiece.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app makes it much easier to have all your notes in one place.  It's great to be able to access the notes on all my devices.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I plan on owning every season of this series.  I refuse to subscribe to cable, and this is the only way I can pay HBO to make more!
1416909532|5.0|i read this book a few years ago and got this one for a friend.. it was different somehow. it had the same cover and author, but it didnt have the work sheets in it or the woman commentary.  still the same concept i guess.. just didnt make it as interesting. i still think everyone should read this book no matter female or male.. think you have game or not.. read it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a classic.  For the price of less than $20 bucks, you do not have an excuse not to add this to your collection!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I love the book. I love this film. It is very true to the book, and the acting is excellent.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Awesome movie, a true classic that defined the genre!  I own the 2 sequels that Scream Factory put out.  It would be awesome if they released this film as well with a slip-case, so my Halloween collection looked awesome on the shelf side-by-side!  Nevertheless, awesome!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My kids love it! They play all the time. Easy to use,  with all different looks. I would recommend to anyone
B0016492BW|5.0|Top-Notch! The image quality is like night and day over my old VHS copy!  If you have an HDTV, this is one of those must-have movies in your collection.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking bad is without a doubt one of the best TV dramas of all time ... Start from the beginning to get the full effect
B0089BSM70|5.0|The restoration of this film, and the reversible slip cover looks awesome.  So much detail!  I can't wait for more from Scream Factory!  Their restorations of old horror flicks are top-notch!
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Man this movie is good, very good. Liked the suspense in this and the twist at the end is superb.
B00BN0BZVY|4.0|I quite enjoyed this book.  I read it in 4 days.  The author really makes you root for the main character, Pat.  He is struggling to be a better person while trying to deal with mental illness and always looking for the silver lining.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a great flick. Denzel , as always plays his character perfectly. Would def watch again.  Loved the human struggles within each character.
044024613X|5.0|It was well-written and a real page-turner; characters were so believable and<br />the ending was unbelievable!  It was a wonderful read from start to finish.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I love plume on my phone so its only right I have it on my kindle ! I love that I can personalize the tweet colors to be what I want them to be !
B004WR125O|5.0|Always good connection easy set up. Does not take any space. The receiver updated with ease. Excellent for Pandora and DLNA
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a show you can get lost in--totally involved with the characters.  It's fun to see the way the writers have them grow and develop.  You can dislike one character in a season and then totally fall in love with them in the next.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Diffrent than the movie and even better!fun to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !  X!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!9 more words required,it's all i have to say pfff
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this trilogy. It kept me interested and involved while reading. I didn't expect it to be great because it was highly rated but advertised as teen reading. I think it is well written and entertaining. The story doesn't drag.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Still working on the first season but I've enjoyied it so far.  Kind of reminds me of the old X-Files shows with all the different topics they expolre.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great.  I downloaded it to send notes from my Kindle to Yahoo mail so I can forward them to my work address! Works perfect!
B009X01C64|5.0|Love the cover...sturdy enough to protect but not too big to handle.  Would highly recommend to anyone buying a kindle.
B0064J6P8W|4.0|This movie was so funny! It was a perfect example of how the grass is not always greener on the other side!
B009DH2PP4|5.0|This book helped me so much in understanding not just how, but why. Let's face it, brewing seems like a very daunting task and sometimes learning from others just isn't as effective as we would like. This book starts out right at the beginning with showing you how to brew so if you are too excited to wait you can immediately begin. Then subsequent chapters break down all the details of why to do things a certain way and many options to get them done. Great first book for anyone who is interested in starting to brew themselves.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|The movie was very funny! Not too long or too short. Watched it with my husband and he even liked it.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Didn't do what I needed it to do. This app stated it would open mobi files.it does not.other than that I'm sure its fine,but I don't have a use for it.wasted money for me.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a story about a man stuck on Mars. You  can imagine that it isn't necessarily riveting, but it is a good story, well written and the main character has a great sense of humor. It is a READ on my list.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very moving story.  It made me cry a few times to think people especially children can be so mean.<br />Shows why children learning compassion and acceptance is so important.  I will always try to look every person I meet in the eyes.<br />In this day of bullying all 5th & 6th graders should read this book.  I bought the hard cover for my Sons bookshelf.  He's a 6th grade teacher.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I really like the Big Bang Theory, it is so funny and light hearted.  I plan on watching all of the seasons!  It's a great show and I Love the quirky characters!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The first installment of the Nikki Heat series is dynamic and catching, realistic to the point of seeming based on real events and convoluted enough to keep the reader wondering who's the real bad guy to the very last chapter. I found the characters unique and intriguing, the settings - well-described, and the detective work quite up to the standards of the TV Series Castle. Love the Show and Love the book.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Best show on TV, so glad there will be another season!  Can't wait for more suspense!  This show keeps me on the edge of my seat!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Complex, thoughtful and at times masterful survival drama with horror elements which dares to ask big philosophical questions and still does not lose it's edge as a pure entertainment or it's more artistic visual edge. The Grey is nothing short of brilliant when it comes to mixing content with visual look. Here is a deeply touching work of art with bursts of action and even occasional horror in the form of lethal wolves. Great movie, worth the time and money to see. Liam Neeson has another hit with this one, outstanding actor.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a simple but addictive game.  As it starts out you're thinking &#34;this is too easy to be fun&#34; but then it gets more difficult as you progress through the various levels.  I find I have to limit myself to keep from spending too much time on it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved. Another excellent book in the series. I am a loyal Michael Connelly fan because he is an excellent writer - mostly - I'm a big Harry Bosch fan because I've grown to know him and find him believable.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great story and an easy read. Actually just a tale of action, albeit tense, with a bit of human conflict tossed in to make it real.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|After reading a handful of bad reviews i went into this expecting a giant pile of turd. Green Lantern seems to be that one superhero movie that everyone seemed to hate and was extremely panned by critics, and to be honest I don't really see anything really insanely bad about it like everyone else. The movie had somewhat decent acting across the board. Nothing great, just good enough for what the actors were given with. I good movie worth a watch.
B008COII1Y|4.0|This movie moves at the speed of the Walking Dead series, however set in the late 1800's civil war era. I'm not going to give spoilers, so let's just say - if you like the Walking Dead series and can get over time periods as far as zombies goes, you'll like this. And the ending will have you wishing it could be a series versus a movie. Good watch!!!!
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I remember watching this when I was much younger and now my boys haved watched it and they think it is just way cool. They love Tron legacy as well.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|Verdi's 200th birthday has seen the proliferation of recorded material of his works made available. It would be hard to better what Decca have done in compiling its Complete edition as rendered here.<br />The young Carerras sounding magnificent, particularly in the Foscari recording to the newly released String Quartet as performed with accuracy and tonal beauty by the Quartetto Italiano are but brief testimony of the overall standard of the music-making.<br />At $200 Australian dollars, for this antipodean collector, it represents amazing value for money.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|What's left to say the title pretty much covers it. I purchased it for my boys as they had seen bits and pieces of it on DTV but wanted to see the whole thing. It was a homerun in my house.
030758836X|5.0|This story has a totally different and sometimes disturbing plot. A must read for anyone who likes something very different.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Excellent characterization; good plotting; great detail / cinematography.  The story keeps you interested in the fate of all the characters. Ragnar is a complex character with an almost manic ambition - one wonders how he will fare in the future - and an icy stare that causes one to question his stability.  Will he pull it off - the viewer anxiously awaits an answer.
B008Y79IUE|3.0|This movie was kind of disturbing to me.  However, I think it is educational.  I would like to show it to my young teens so they can see consequences of drug use.  Hopefully this will make an impact.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids really enjoy playing this game.  I myself dont really get it but hey they like it so im happy.

B001ANSSDC|2.0|Had a hard time getting into this book. It was good but it just was not one my favorite books.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I like the game but Amazon is always left out in updates it needs the newest update it's already on the Google play store and on the iPad but not on Amazon they need to be up to date with the others but i still like the game
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Got this for a good friend.  She and her husband have really enjoyed it.  They've passed it along to other friends!  Seems this movie is \\"UNSTOPPABLE\\"  I know, bad pun!!!!  Great show!
B003U53GK8|5.0|Completely original, loved every minute of this show. Can't wait to see it again. I got all my friends to watch and they are all hooked.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I guess I was hopping for more, after loving the Phantom of the Opera.  But this sequel left me feeling let down.  The premise was weak in my view, the Phantom goes to Coney Island, I just could'nt buy it.  But even more far fetched, why would Christine go there?  And the characters of Meg and her Mother seemed to me to be the complete opposites of the characters in Phantom.  I really think it could have been better.  But I lied it nonetheless.  JRV
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Like knowing what my battery life is. Helps me keep up with my time on my battery. Best app so far

B00280LYIC|5.0|I recommend this book to people who like mythology and action.<br />This was a great book because it was awesome
B00B935SUY|4.0|Grohl did a great job focusing on the importance of the studio and the artists that recorded there.  That was the first act.  The second act was about jamming with these artists and then recording a soundtrack.  Highly recommend it for rock music fans.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Attention Vorkosigan Saga lovers: If you wondered what Cousin Ivan has been up to while Miles does his Imperial Auditor thing, here's your answer. He's grown into a character of quiet competency and studied intelligence, with his sense of irony fully intact. Yet there's that streak of impulse that most of Bujold's characters possess that moves this story forward and keeps the reader guessing.<br /><br />OK, it does help if you are already acquainted with the main cast of Bujold's Baryarrans and other inhabitants of the Hub, but what interesting insights you'll gain.<br /><br />I love the multiple meanings for &#34;alliance&#34; in this book's titles, and I love where this series is taking its characters. What started as fairly typical &#34;space opera&#34; with armies, navies and space shoot-em-ups has become so much more. Long-time readers of this series will remember that romance was also there from the start. Nice to see that this is the direction being taken in an increasingly peaceful Hub.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This was a great choice in movie and seller. It arrived before the due date and in mint condition. I didn't find one flaw in this movie or its case. My grandson adores this movie, as well as the rest of the household. Without a doubt I would use this seller for my future purchases.
B00BU8QOII|5.0|will watch this again and again. One family's harrowing experience and survival.Action and adventure. Well acted great casting.<br />Highly recommended !
B003U4UPTE|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever watched!  Love the characters, special effects, plot and scenery.  Filmed in Oahu, Hawaii and it can't be any more beautiful anywhere else!  I bought all six seasons!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The winning celebration on the iPad version is more flamboyant and longer in duration. We androids request equal recognition for our success.

B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I doubt i can add much to the discussion of the content of &#34;The Hobbit.&#34; I will comment that I have only watched the 3D version, and it comes on two Blu-Ray disks, and is of high quality.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The acting was great! Liked the learning about the history of Lincoln and his family. Felt like it dragged in spots.
0007150342|5.0|I love this book.  It is so magical yet simple.  I would recommend it for any age!! Was exactly as described.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|A favorite since it began. Love Abby, Ducky, and Jethro. Usually not as violent as other crime shows. Has some good humor. However, don't feel the characters have the depth of some other shows.
B00899F0G8|4.0|Fashion, friends, and fiendish foes! This show has it all. We love all the twists and turns as our ladies try to outsmart A. Really fun.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|What drives our love, fears, hopes, loyalty? What will make us truly happy - meeting society's expectations or being true to ourselves? The Kitchen House made me think about a lot of these things. I'm looking forward to reading more by Kathleen Grissom.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Racking up debt, missing house payments, complaining non-stop, all the while driving around in a nice BMW and a Lexus.  That doesn't get me sympathetic to their dumb but rich white people problems.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of Thrones is one of the best shows on TV.  I watched it on HBO, then bought the Blu-ray to rewatch before Season 3 started.  Loved it.  High quality.
B004JMZPJG|3.0|Loop threads hanging out. Threads are hanging out and cutting them may effect the seems. The only pockets (on sides) are very small and with a DSLR camera no room around camera for storage. It holds camera and one medium zoom lens<br />( 18-100mm zoom ) charger & cords plus extra battery and extra SD card. It is compact and that was what I was looking for so I am giving it 3 stars because of quality issues.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|A good movie for children, better if caption is provided. Full of adventures my 9 year son loved it. Animation is almost real.
096798467X|5.0|Anything and everything about making earthen ovens!!! If you want to know how to and how much the cost this is the perfect book.
B0033807C2|5.0|I loved this book. It was such a great end to the series and so many things came together in a way that was not expected.
1401941893|3.0|The author sounds like a very nice young woman, but this certainly seems to have a narrow target for an audience.  Strictly female, as if Hay House believes men aren't at all interested in self improvement.  And young, very young, I would say.  This seems more suitable for teen age girls than for adult women.<br /><br />The writer is so nice sounding, I wish I could give her little book a positive review.  Sorry, I just can't.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The ending was lost in a lot of verbiage.  After the climax there was too much filler. His other books were better.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|IT'S SO EASY TO STREAM MUSIC FROM THE CLOUD TO MY IPAD AND IPOD.  FILES COVERT TO ITUNES FILES EASILY.
B007WPLZAK|5.0|I totally agree that, \\"This has to be one of the best love stories I have EVER seen.\\"  It is intense, appeals to the \\"ideal woman/man\\" concept and is possibly a turn-on, for us older gents, yet a well-written, well-produced version unequaled, I believe, in films.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|People from this war an time period amaze me with strength an character.  Zusak couldn't have done a better job.  Genius writing it from death's point of view.
141659521X|5.0|In this book Mitch Rapp had turned into a relentless (and repulsive) killing machine.  Why are we still on this message after the tragedies of the last ten years?  Has anyone noticed that violence begets violence?  We need a more thoughtful approach to our national and international problems.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Keeps you interested and you just want to keep reading because you want to know what happens.. The series is wonderful.. Highly recommended.
B002WQZHJO|5.0|I love Denzel, so to see him play a bad guy is difficult.  He is awesome in this movie!  Awesome!
0307595579|5.0|A great writer and a great translater make this a greeat read.  I amsorry the author died, I selfishly would have liked to see some more books by him.
B003M70O5O|5.0|all episodes were in good quality... great show! using amazon was a convenient way to watch episodes and get caught up on past episodes!
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Not Bad for Free<br /><br />Its easy to get started and gets harder as you move along. I wouldn't pay for it though.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Great knife, rugged build with a good edge.  Feels balanced, and the blade sharpens well....... premium quality product, I will buy another Ka-Bar soon.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|enjoyed it. very cute and funny, I would recommend this to anyone of all ages. Kept my grandson entertained for hours
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book starts with hopes and dreams of a young man, a SEAL, and then moves to the newlywed couple. The wife's view is interspersed providing a great balance to Chris's view of the storyline. The deployments are covered, and the message is straight forward and honest. I was very moved with his attitude toward &#34;his boys,&#34; the accountability for his team. Reading the issues and problems his wife and he faced, how they were dealt with, and finally overcome will have to be a great encouragement to all who read this book. Thank you for your service and for writing this book.
034554398X|5.0|I have read the whole series and think this is by far the best.  It picked me up and swept me away from start to finish.  I am a huge fan of dark fantasy and this is by far some of the best I have ever read.  Nobody is safe and all of the characters good and bad have depth and life. A Storm of Swords is dark and gritty and turns the series upside down.  I loved it. I have read that some people stopped reading in the middle because of some tragic unexpected events, but believe me its worth reading until the end.  Things maybe are not what they seem to be. ;)
B000SEI230|5.0|I saw the movie but the book was so much better. I couldn't read it without tearing up. I love this book.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|But for the attempts of Paul Rudd to turn this mess into a movie, Apatow could be said without contradiction to have made a \\"movie\\" solely for the opportunity and excuse of watching his wife touch Megan Fox's breasts.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this battery app. it is very handy to have. I tell all my family and friends about it so they all use it now .
B000AYELVA|4.0|While having a sufficiency of gizmo's, combat and explosive situations, what raises this a notch above the ordinary is the weakness of the strongest and the conflict of equally legitimate \\"solutions\\" to the problem of whether those of extraordinary talents should be embraced within the common weal or excluded as enemies of the existing. Not that there is much emphasis on the latter point, it is,  in fact, pretty much downplayed. Yet, it does exist in the mind of the viewer, if only as the rationale for the action.<br />Perhaps, it is my total ignorance of the comic book source for the film; perhaps it is my unfamiliarity with the other X-Men films: however,  I made no sense out of the Concentration Camp scene with which the film commences. There is no follow-up in the story to account for the significance of an event leading to the body of the film.<br />I take it, this was the first of a series of movies made from the same comic book source; if so, it is a good lead-in, as well as being entertaining, in and of itself. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are both quite well suited to play leaders of the contesting \\"deviant\\" subgroups contesting for dominance for their viewpoint of how humans and the talented should interact. Both have the acting skills  and presence to make their leadership seem appropriate. The rest of the cast play their sometime deliberately ugly roles with suitable exaggeration.<br />This is light,  easy on the mind, entertainment. Recommended for that evening when fantastical action not societal difficulties are called for.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is hilarious! All the characters add their own layer of humor and the situations they get into are nothing short of hysterical!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I have a feeling that with few exceptions the Frankenstein Monster, Wherewolves and Vampires, can can be gratifying in horror or comedy films, not both. That was my problem (perhaps the key factor was age); I could not differentiate the elements of humor from those of horror/adventure. That in turn led me to the avoidance of any real fear for the lives of the key characters and no sense of awe at the assorted monsters including Frankenstein's and Dracula. It was pretty much like a trapeze act with a net to catch them safely if they fell; one admires their skill, but has no fear for their lives.<br />These aspects of the film apart, what was left was well done, the acting, such as it was,  suited the occasion, the stunts were good ones and the action nearly continuous (which was a good decision on the part of the creators). My minimal TV equipment, as compared to that in a movie house or at home with a full set of top visual and sound reproducers, meant I was seeing quite a different film than did those who had better equipment.<br />In sum, it was pleasant but not exciting viewing for me. I imagine those who are younger or better equipped will get more, perhaps a good deal more, than did I.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I have always been a HUGE fan of Les Miserables, there have been numerous screen adaptations over the years, this is hands down the best! This all-star cast gives a phenomenal performance and it follows the stage production exactly.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Primal Fear is a great movie.I would watch it again.  Enjoyable suspenseful with a plot that kept me riveted.  Love Richard Gere!
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This was a good story, and enjoyable as much as a simple positive story can be.  Maybe I expected more from all the hype; it is like the Celestine Prophecy, and many other books that are helping to turn on the world, but the writing in itself could have been better, although that could be simply the translation.  If you are looking to begin a journey to the deeper realms of energy and intuition, this book is for you.
1439152799|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books!  I enjoyed each one of them.  The Distant Hours is just as good as the reviewers said it would be.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|It's different for him, but very interesting and soothing to listen to.  I'm glad I got it and although I know he's a talented person, he never disappoints.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Felt the author was meeting the Publishers demand to produce a book.  The plot was weak and writing was below the authors abilities.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is the only thing that could help me when my Kindle Fire storage filled up but showed nothing downloaded.  This app showed that 5 deleted movies were hanging out in my storage space and took them off.  Among other things!  Freed up a TON of space on my device.  I'm talking 5 GB!!  Amazon told me the only thing I could do was a factory reset.  So thankful I didn't start all over!!
B00BF11STU|3.0|The entire movie leads up to the climax of Seal Team Six thing. A little disappointing. Glad I only spent the $3.99 instead of the $15 in the theatre.
1451648537|5.0|I am still reading this...almost finished.  I am amazed at how well Isaacson has put this story together.  It is very interesting, never boring or dry.  Jobs was a &#34;genius&#34; in some respects...good for the world, but not well mentally or emotionally.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Afeck did a good job and very covincing as Tony Mendez. I stayed awake during the entire movie (a first).
B0076DELIG|3.0|I expected this to be a fast paced exciting story, but was very disappointed. It moved slowly and the best part was the last 20 pages.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|More bits of background information revealed in this middle book, endearing the characters to the reader even more.  Was hoping after investing so much time in reading the 3 books I would not be disappointed with the outcome, and I certainly was not. I was hesitant to read them at first, thinking they were for younger women--couldn't have been more wrong.  Women of any age will enjoy the complexity of the characters and the storyline.
B008HK3XOU|2.0|I had an invisi-shield placed on the screen of my kindle also.  After about three weeks I had these terrible orange stains all over my screen.  My family accused me of eating cheese curls while reading (a charge I was guilty of). I had the screen replaced for $10.  After another couple weeks, the screen had orange stains again.  This time I know I hadn't eaten cheese curls.  After a few days, I noticed oily stains on the inside cover when I opened the case.  They matched up with the stains perfectly.  It's the case causing the stains.  I just wonder what it would have done to the glass had I not protected it. I went and bought myself another case.  I'm just glad it didn't cost me more money
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So many books leave you wondering what happened to the characters--not this one.  Not only is there an epilogue to answer reader questions, but the way she wraps up the trilogy by telling the story of how the main characters met from the other character's point of view, is genius.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a kid and always pulls at my heart strings.  Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are wonderful together with their chemistry and well-written dialogue.  Haley Mills is fun and mischievous playing the twins.  Kudos also to Joanna Barnes as &#34;Vicki&#34; who is delightful as the gold-digging fiance.  The wonderful backdrop in the California coast and mountains is beautiful as is the incredible Mid-Century ranch home furnished with now sought-after design treasures.  I love the newer version with Lindsey Lohan, but this one is still my favorite.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I di dnot care for this book at all. Matter of face it put it down after 100 pages. If the author hasn't caught me by the 100 pages--away it goes.<br />It was depressing. There is enough depressing and terror items in our real life--I don't need to read about it too.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Doesnt live up to the hype around this movie. Moments of real insights but didnt save the movie.  too bad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just want to balance my check book, or quickly decide how many planks of sod to buy for the lawn.  I don't need Algebra!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed this book from start to finish.  Never saw end coming!  Very savvy and intelligent writing.  Will check out more from Landry.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|I've been listening to KSE since Alive or Just Breathing and was a little disappointed when Jesse left the band.  I didn't care for Howard at first, but then he grew on me and I liked his work a lot.  I've seen KSE live many times (all with Howard) and was always blown away by their shows.<br /><br />I loved The End of Heartache and As Daylight Dies to a lesser degree.  I really didn't care too much for their second self titled release as I felt like they had dialed it in.  I just felt like a very generic album and well below my expectations of the band.<br /><br />I completely fell in love with the Times of Grace album because it just was loaded with great cohesive songs from start to finish.  Jesse's vocals have come a long way since Alive or Just Breathing, so I was extremely excited when Jesse rejoined KSE.  His passion could be felt throughout the Times of Grace album and the same can also be said of Disarm The Descent.  I was sad to see Howard leave, but Jesse really revitalized KSE and I think his vocal styling actually fits better with this musical style than Howard's more soulful clean vocals.
B003B02PEU|4.0|I chose this rating as I believe the top ranking should be for those books you just like to carry around with you all the time.  The Last Juror is well written and true to the South.  Being a southerner I especially enjoyed reading about Miss<br />Callie's food.  Unfortunately, it is very true to the feelings and thinking of the South back in the 70's.  The characters are quite believable and the descriptions are vivid and understandable, of course, living in that period, it was easy to imagine the streets, island, roads,etc.  It is a very good read, I believe most people would enjoy it, especially Southerners.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great way to keep up on your emails from your kindle or ipad.  You are never out of touch no matter where you are.

B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This might be okay if playing on a laptop or desktop, but not for a Kindle! Need a magnifying glass to see the items. Will see if Big Fish has it for my laptop
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is predictable.  They set you up so you can guess what happens...and it does happen.  Usually I don't bother with a series that carries this attribute, but not with this one.  I love it.  I think it's the acting and the writing as well as the beautiful homestead that takes me into this guilty pleasure.  Season 3 is no exception.  I do like watching it through Amazon because they use the British version instead of the Masterpiece Classic that's available on PBS here in the states.  I'm looking forward to season 4.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was an awesome book. I can't wait for the next installment. I love all the real stuff that has been depicted in its pages.
B00C1BVAYG|3.0|The movie was great....our family watched it together but the volume on the movie kept adjusting so we watched it continuously changing the volume with the remote.  One minute you couldnt hear what the actors were saying, the next it was defening....otherwise...we enjoy the Jurassic Park movies!!  We did rent the others as well and did not have this problem!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was interested in this book through the recommendation of my daughter. It is filled with times of sheer excietment and horror at the same time. It is not a book for children but it is one that I would recommend for those who like thillers.

B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Starts out great. Runs well on Fire HD.  But when you use up your initial lives, you have to wait 8 mins. for another one! That's not fun.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I've loved this movie every time I've watched it.  Recently I rented it from Amazon so that my girlfriend could watch before the sequel next month.  She loved it!<br /><br />Only complaint is that half way through, the movie wouldn't play.  We ended up finishing the movie on the Xbox.  For some reason the Roku box just wouldn't buffer correctly when it started messing up.  That's more of a Roku issue rather than a movie issue.<br /><br />In the time of switching devices... I tried to play on my computer and it said that you couldn't play Amazon digital purchases on a computer.  Amazon should let you play your rentals on a computer through the website.  Seems like a no-brainer.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|3 stars because the book was a good read; however, it was predictable, did not seem to follow the same theme as the prequel. As a sequel it  was expected that this book would piece together events that would have happened in book one and continued into book two; unfortunately this was not the case. Stand alone, the book was a good read. It is clear from the motion picture movie \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" there will not be a sequel to the film; however, this would make for a good movie.
1401937519|5.0|Great book to read.  It is amazing what she went through and it gives people hope.  It is written very well.
B007SGM084|3.0|I put off reading this trilogy but after hearing more and more people talk about it, I decided to try it. It kept me reading but it also frustrated me at the same time. I probably would not recommend this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot wait for next season!  Amazon Prime really makes Downtwon Abbey easily accessible from anywhere.  Do not miss this show!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012: A very moving, fantastic special effects, fast paced great syfy that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I purchased the regular DVD and then Bluray; this is a must own and see. (Director: Roland Emmerich; Writers: Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser. Stars: Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, Tom McCarthy, John Cusack, Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor (and other great actors and actresses) performed their parts quite well.  This movie is extremely inclusive of all nationalities and for this we should be proud. Had to include additional information of the 2012 because there was another 2012 which was intentionally non inclusive and had only one ethnic group involved; again, removing all people of color. I was so taken aback that I didn't watch the entire movie but enough to know it was worthless and a total waste of time. The acting was cheesy, unbelievable, failed totally to even approach reality and completely clumsy in its presentation as well.<br /><br />Castatrophic events of the world naturally involve people of all colors in every aspect of life which include scientists, inventors, etc. It has been proven over and over again and again that one ethnic group does not have all the answers but that when we work together we can accomplish what is needed. This movies shows us that on all levels.<br /><br />Attempts to hold other groups down prevent the dominant group from rising. In all aspects of life the world would have been much farther along if the dominant group had not held people of color down. WORK TOGETHER PEOPLE and we all rise together.
1423140605|5.0|The book was in great shape upon arrival and it came in the mail the very first day it said it would!
B007HJ8V76|4.0|This is an interesting movie and Salma looks so much like Frida that it is scary.  However, the story is sanitized for what reason I can't imagine.  There is no mention of Nick Muray who Frida had a 10 year affair with.  In addition the timeline of events is muddled, maybe for artisitic effect, but some events that occurred later in life are shown earlier.  Still it does feel as if many parts ring true, but it is not a dcoumentary of her life, so don't trust everything is presents.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I have heard and seen any versions of Les Mis.  This was the least enjoyable.  The songs were overacted to the point of being non melodic.  Listening and watching the faces agonize was painful. Only Russell Crowe seemed to just sing and he is not a singer.  In addition, it was too long, couldn't wait for it to be over and turned it off.
1451695195|5.0|It is a new book; the subject matter is very inspiring and interesting.  It gives one hope of the future.  The book arrived quickly and is in great condition.  Thank you
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|A fascinating, accessible insight of how the brain can be malleable. Although this is all founded in academic and medical information, the author clearly explains the processed of the brain. As a teacher and a parent I found this so interesting regarding children's mental development.
B002Z0TPFE|4.0|Not really into the GI Joe thing but watched it with my son.  Liked it and will go see the next one.
160774273X|5.0|Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast by Ken Forkish is by far the best bread-making technique I've tried so far. I've tried refrigerator doughs and tried Reinhart's techniques, but this technique creates a more 'luxurious' dough. You can feel the difference in the dough, especially in the poolish. Once you get the technique down, you'll find it's easier than Reinhart's techniques, almost as easy as refrigerator dough techniques, and the bread comes out wonderful every time. The temperatures and timing seem very precise, but even when I haven't done everything just right the bread still turns out better than any bread I've made before. The dough is very forgiving. Plus, once you see what a great light, flavorful loaf you get with the 75% whole wheat recipe, you'll be hooked on healthier bread. If you like the taste of less yeast, like a flavorful crunchy crust and a wonderful crumb you'll love this warm dough technique.
0312853254|1.0|Over half the print lines of the kindle version are so small they are almost impossible to read.<br /><br />The kindle version of Enders Game was easy to read but I gave up on Speaker For The Dead and bought the Barns and Noble version which was easy to read.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This was so funny. It reminded me of Old Dogs except with cartoon characters and a different story line. I would recommend this for adults and kids.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|I must admit that I was not really a big fan of Hannibal when it first came out long ago.  I guess the hype at the time did not live up to the first movie (Silence of the Lambs).  I also had a difficult time with the 'new' Agent Starling actress. However, such a long time had past since I watched Hannibal I was able to view it as a stand-alone move rather than a sequal.  In so doing, I found it to be much more engaging and more readily accepted the fine acting of Ms. Moore in her role.  I am glad I watched it again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book really held my interest and I liked the way it was written from both of their perspectives. That being said I had to reread the last page 5 times and it still left me very unsettled. I felt like he knew she was maniacal and I coudn't understand why he said what he did about being glad he didn't have to wake up every day and be her...it was like he played into her hands. I think I get that they were both not normal (duh!) but I guess I just thought he was capable of outsmarting her and the ending just blew me away.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I like it. For a procedural it's not bad. It's no walking dead, but its a great little show! Yo
B00BESIKWM|5.0|Almost as good as the original but better than any horror flick I've seen lately. I also like how it was left open for another sequel.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, long before my son was born. We just watched it again, first time for him, and everyone really enjoyed it. The beginning in particular and some of the parts in the middle were a little frightening for him, and I'm glad we didn't show it to him when he was younger (when a lot of his friends were seeing it), but this was a great age to show it to him.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Too long, one of those books, you just want to get over with! I had higher expectations. It got interesting at the end, it seemed like.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|My Kindle was damaged when I was three-quarters through the story and I couldn't wait to get a replacement so I could find out what happened to my characters.
B00003CX97|5.0|As described
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|I really enjoyed this game. Me and my five year old played it together. Maybe I just am not smart enough for it. I can't manage to get enough starts to get past the tutorial level. Very frustrating cause really is a fun and great game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addictive! I really like how easy this is to use... really fun! Get it now!  Just be sure to have plenty of time to play it. :)
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|A nice mix of her favorite songs I loved to listen to.  This is one album I love to listen to a lot.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My daughter has seen it a million times and I haven't but she wanted to watch it again.  Besides her talking through the whole movie and telling me what was happening, I really enjoyed it!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. The touch controls on the Kindle are very good and it gets better as you get further along. One of the best free games I have seen. You need to try it.
B005T87QCI|2.0|My sons have this product on their Kindles.  And they have loaded some of the additional features/items as well, and now the program fails to open properly.  I am not sure if this is from the additional bots, or just the program in general, because we cannot get into the game at all.<br /><br />They really liked the game when they first downloaded it, ... when it worked.  It was a bit disappointing that it doesn't have the same features as their fellow games on other equipment.<br /><br />Now, ... we are just all around disappointed.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|What can I say, I am a Trekker. I love all things Star Trek, it does not matter which series, which episode, which actor or actress.<br /><br />I have re-watched every episode of every season.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|life long fan, why would I not get it...good to see the boys back to just fun punk/alt/rock, the rock operas were cool but i missed this kinda stuff.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the ease of use anywhere and the game it's self, a great way to relax while waiting for appointments or just relaxing at home.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My kids love to play this game and always want to show me what they have done on it and their pets.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is still the classic story I read as a child.  I am now 78 and I loved it all over again.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|You do not have much time to play this game. It is fun but after you run out of tokens you must buy more and I do not like that part.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This book is so realistic that it hurts a little. You find yourself loving and hating and even worse relating to the characters through out the entire book.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but I think I liked it so much because I read the book first. A couple things were different and there was not near enough development of the relationships between the characters. I simply love Jennifer Lawrence. I can't wait for the 2nd movie!
B0029LCJJS|4.0|As a history buff found Tudors to be fairly accurate. Mixture of dramatically correct and slightly enhanced factually based  history. English monarchy is of great interest. Queen Elizabeth, the virgin queen would be a nice sequel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app to keep handy. I have used it around the house to do bills and at work when I grade papers.
B000FA675C|4.0|I'm enjoying the book. It is a good book for a kindle as I'm not very fluent in French and Latin, so using the translate feather has really come in handy.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I bought this item for my step dad for Christmas. He enjoys it very much, being a a huge Johnny Cash fan himself. He plays the CD all the time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for the new one to start!  So sad at the end of Season 3, what is Mary going to do???
B002VX0A40|5.0|As a grandmother I saw this and it fit my grandson.  Nice colors and texture. It is a good size too
B0067R0APK|3.0|Works like it should on the Kindle Fire!<br /><br />Radar does not display properly on the Note II, go figure!<br /><br />I've written several times with no feedback from AccuW.  Ho hum who cares - we got your money!
B0095G5AFU|5.0|This is just the notebook app I was looking for.  It's great way to store notes from meetings, seminars e.c.t. It is also easy to use and you can select how much pages you want for each note book.
0452289963|5.0|I am on the second reading of this wonderful book--I bought it twice because I write extensively in the margins.  This book has assisted me greatly in grieving for the recent loss of my husband of 53 years.  The first reading supplimented my study of Zen; the second reading is helping me to want to keep living.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to grow spiritually
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This DVD is stellar. Slane castle was one of the best live performances  by the  Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you are a fan it is a must see and I highly recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Too often programs don't live up to the hype surrounding it. However, DA does.  Great stories, great acting, beautiful scenery, characters to love and hate.<br />One of the best shows on TV!!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This movie is destined to become a classic.  It was so well done that it was like stepping back in history.  Daniel Day-Lewis became Lincoln and represents one of the best performances I have ever seen in cinema.  He received the Oscar for best actor and there was no one that came close to his performance.  This movie should have received the best picture Oscar along with best director and best supporting actress.  My opinion is based on seeing the other movies in contention for these awards.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|It lives up to the chaotic, hectic, frenetic style of Mission Impossible movies of the past.  Of course, the events that happened are impossible, so it lives up to its name.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This season is even better than the last.  It has great production values and the storyline is  very, very engaging.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|Incredibly boring. I can't believe even with taking other people's songs as his backing tracks he can't even come up with better music than this.  Sad.
B00499LTLM|5.0|Fun and brilliant revisit to 221B Baker Street.  Artfully and respectfully done, it is worthy of S.H. fans attention whether you first met him and the Doctor from the original text or from the plethora of film and TV portrayals that have come before.
B00BLF9FOK|2.0|I watched this flick out of nostalgia for the \\"good old times\\" when I used to watch the old schwarzy movies like Conan or Predator... or the classic Terminator saga..but I regret I did.. this movie is more stupid then Commando and hey, it's not even the 80s anymore... I would even let the heavily unrealistic initial escape of the \\"bad guy\\" ( a drug dealer megaboss..) go, but then.. this guy getting on the highway on a super duper corvette all the way down to mexico and the FBI being unable to stop him? And does he really need an assault bridge to be built for him to cross a little canyon? And all the FBI can do is send a couple cars that get crushed by his corvette ...so that we can have a \\"modern cowboy scene\\" ? Come on.. who writes this stuff?The best that can be said about this flick is that it is a huge commercial for firearms and a time sink for morons..<br />Even the classical schwarzenegger \\"cheesy but fun and quirky\\" acting is off.. like he himself doesn't really believe in what he's doing.. or maybe he's just become too dry and boring after meddling with politics (and what politics..)<br />Couldn't you wait for something at least a little more decent, Schwarzy?
B002RI9MZC|4.0|My husband rated this book more than me I thi. nk because we had watched the series on television. It was interesting to travel with him through his life something different. Didn't like the ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book if ever read it is an everybody book after finishing the book watch the movie:) tell your friends to read it
B0076UXKDG|3.0|I like the way it works but given the additional benefits it is very expensive<br />It works well but again think twice before spending this kind of money. There are more useful accessories that you can buy instead of this.
0988178532|5.0|A thoughtful and artfully written first novel by Brandt Legg. Interesting characters, powerful imagery, and lessons for all readers! Can't wait to read the second book!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|i should have reviewed this book a long time ago. I read it the day it came out, and sadly i had to re read it again after Mt Kyle's passing. GREAT BOOK!!<br /><br />RIP Mr. Kyle
B000LB7G00|5.0|if you don't need all the programmable buttons of the larger model then certainly save your money. Takes up minimal space on your desktop and heavy enough that it never slips around during use. Plugs in and ready to go quickly and able to store individual settings for different applications. highly recommend it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good book to pass the time. I think it took me two nights to get through it, as it is an easy read; but very exciting.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Someone posted a video of Lindsey's on Facebook and I was instantly hooked!  I've never heard a violin played like that before - it's absolutely amazing!  This young woman is extremely talented and her music shows it.  All of the songs on this album are upbeat, ethereal, and emotionally intense.  I find myself closing my eyes and getting lost in thought whenever one of her songs comes up on my playlist.<br /><br />As to the technical quality, the MP3s are of high quality - no excess noise that is sometimes present in poorly executed MP3s.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Lindsey Stirling, or just enjoy hearing music that is a mix of Riverdance, electronica, and classical - buy this album!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Sometimes could be tough keeping up with the fast moving drama from WWII to present time and back and forth.  Nesbo is amazingly entertaining and well researched.  Two more Harry Hole's will be released on Kindle in May - check Amazon for release on print versions.  Also, check Nesbo's website for listings of all novels and the Hole series in order.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A wonderful read.  At the end of the book, it was good  to have all the pieces come together.  I loved it.
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|Tim Burton's 1989 classic is a must-see for Batman fans.<br />the blu-ray steelbook is a must-have for enthusiasts.<br /><br />i can still remember going to see this movie in a jam-packed theater.<br />a true blockbuster, it was the top-grossing film in North America that year.<br />great acting, great story, great soundtrack, great movie.<br /><br />Michael Keaton's Batman is dark, brooding, and tormented.  i loved Keaton in Beetlejuice but didn't think he could pull this role off until i saw it for myself.  Jack Nicholson was unforgettable as the Joker. Nicholson's joker is maniacal magic.  not as dark as Ledger's (The Dark Night), but much more fun. Kim Bassinger is Vicki Vale, whose affections are pursued by both Batman and the Joker.<br /><br />Prince's soundtrack is awesome.  the score (Danny Elfman) is well done.  the costumes are great and the set design won an Oscar.  plus...all of Batman's \\"wonderful toys\\".<br /><br />great special features (unchanged from the 20th anniversary release):<br /><br />+ Commentary by Director Tim Burton<br />+ On the Set with Bob Kane<br />+ Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman - The Comic Book Saga as Reinvented and Reintrepeted over Seven Decades<br />+ Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Parts 1-3<br />+ The Road to Gotham City<br />+ The Gathering Storm<br />+ The Legend Reborn<br />+ Beyond Batman Documentary Gallery (6 Featurettes) -  Visualizing Gotham: The Production Design of Batman / Building the Batmobile / Those Wonderful Toys: The Props and Gadgets of Batman / Designing the Batsuit / From Jack to the Joker / Nocturnal Overtures: The Music of Batman<br />+ 3 Prince Music Videos: Batdance, Partyman and Scandalous<br />+ Heroes and The Villains Profile Galleries<br />+ Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboard Sequence<br />+ Theatrical Trailer
B00821OX98|4.0|well done, Noah surprisingly good as a thinking mans action hero I also find it irritating that amazon forces a specific word count, its part of the reason I don't leave many reviews
098478280X|5.0|I was very tempted to buy this book. I didn't originally plan on working for any major companies, but I thought long and hard about it and I believe it's something I should strive for. I've only read through about 20 pages of the book so far, but from the short read I can tell it's going to be a good one. I say definitely pick it up.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I find Game of Thrones very entertaining. It is a fantasy drama set in what I would call a Medieval fantasy world. The characters are interesting (although I sometimes have a problem keeping the straight).  There is a coniving Queen regent, her snotty totally self serving younger brother, the king, Lovely princesses and their ladies in waiting, villains, and even dragons. Period costumes are great.
B00881PTRC|1.0|Nothing Like A Word Game That Uses Crap Words That Can't Be Found In Any  Of The Dictionaries Offered At The End Of The Round When You Lose. Cool Idea, Poor Execution
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Solid show, good acting, great for a marathoning session! Kind of like Law & Order but with a more personal story line mixed in.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|We still like a &#34;gladiator&#34; storyline, but this time it has been updated with a heroine as the main character.  Very enjoyable movie and awaiting the next one...
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I'm way behind on catching this show, but I'm glad I finally caught up. Definitely worth streaming for free if you have prime.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|One of my favorite series, but not my favorite book in the series.<br />To read more of my thoughts on this book, go to my blog:<br />[...]
B0060CV31C|4.0|This movie is pretty cute. I do not have any children and I still enjoy this movie. The characters are funny and the humor is rich throughout the movie. It has a good story line and allot of action in the end for cartoon movie.
0894803123|4.0|This colorfully illustrated book (cartoons) gives a fun and entertaining background of the Ben and Jerry story; however, the recipes are a bit older and include items such as raw eggs.  I use this primarily for entertainment value and pleasure reading; I have not yet used any of the recipes as I find that modern ice cream recipes work better with my electric ice cream maker.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Always worth reading Jeffrey Archer and always follow the Clifton Chronicles.  So pleased we have Kindle, now that was a good buy
B009H5IS1W|5.0|My favorite show For 8 years. When is next season starting????? The subjects are a little distrubing love the quotes.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|These sweethearts of the opera stage of today. show their magic in this Donizetti comic opera.........Ronaldez and Anna  are perfect.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Would definitely recommend this movie for a fun family night. We pulled it up one night and my two boys are 20 and 23 years old! It was a nice family time with the four of us and made us laugh!
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|He did it again, Remastered the original and re-released a gem that has been hidden far too long. With appearances by George Harrison among many other of his friends, this is just a brilliant recording.For me, two tracks stand out, but only because they woud fit on the Long Wave album. They are September Song and Stormy Weather, how I would love to see more albums of the Standards by Mr Lynne, his arrangements are top-notch.<br />All in All Jeff Lynne being ELO, being Jeff Lynne with all that entails.<br />Great music, great production, Great musicians. What more can anybody wish for?
B0063M22QO|5.0|Have always enjoyed this game and the Kindle edition lives up to my expectations.  The colors are vibrant and I appreciate that I can mute the sound so that I am not disturbing others.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Reread after many years.  What a great story set in WWII to a historical background.  It is about keeping the deception about Operation Overlord occurring at Calais instead of Normandy and a Nazi super spy.  Don't want to give away anything.  If you like historical thrillers, you will LOVE this book.
B009ZQTD7Q|5.0|what a beautiful story. they don't make films like this any more. If they did I would be renting them.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A little hard to maneuver around. Not much with help in the app itsef. Easy to download onto my kindle.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Don't know how the makers of Mario don't sue over this game. It's essentially the same thing but with a leprechaun. Kids love it though, they play it a lot.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|The movie was entertaining for me and my 3 year old.  I imagine he will continue to watch it for a few more years.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I just couldn't get into the game. It was too much to set up, track and remember. When the game started I was watching the screen saying, &#34;what the hell?&#34; Just MHO.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The screwdriver is fun and can make any fan of the Tenth Doctor smile. There is some irony, however, in the fact that you need a tiny screwdriver to put the batteries in the Sonic.
1400031567|5.0|The Kurt Wallander series is superb!  Central character is human.  Foibles and all.  Stand up guy.  His supporting cast is well developed and very realistic.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I saw all of the original series when it aired many years ago so wanted to see what would be done with the new series.  I got hooked immediately and had to watch several episodes in a row.  Loved every one.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|One of my new favorite movies!  Great movie and great story.  The best part is to look at the true history and see how similar it is.  Highly recommend!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Got this because my grandchildren wanted to watch it and I must admit I enjoyed watching it as much as they did.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|What else can you say, it's a twitter app.  I am new to twitter and the app works just fine.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Waited for this to become available since I missed seeing it in the theatre.  We had some problems with the sound in the beginning but eventually adjusted the options on the TV so it sounded fine.  Really enjoyed the movie.
B000NYWT9S|5.0|I bought this for my wife and she loves it!  Can you really go wrong with the many recipes and examples in the book?  My wife mainly uses it as a decoration at her bakery but she loves it!
B009NG1Q96|1.0|I waited all these months for this?  The Selection broke my heart with the depth of its characters and its near-perfect execution.  The Elite, however, reads like it was written by a committee of 12 year-old girls, bouncing between, but never settling on a plot twist long enough to let the reader engage.  If Kiera was trying to make me really dislike all the characters I loved from the first book, she succeeded.  I now not only don't care who is selected, I hope they're all overthrown.  The Selection is still a nearly perfect tale.  Just pretend The Elite never happened and imagine your own next chapter.
1412960991|5.0|Case study research can be complex.  This book really lays out the groundwork for how to look at the case study and even how to attempt your own case study research.  Quite easy to read and provides a great foundation for case study research!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Fast,easy to use, easy to read and reply or forward. Can even have 2 accounts. Works great on Kindle fire.
B007TMON8M|4.0|This is a challenging and fun game.  I do wish there were some instructions though...  some of the levels are darn near impossible to solve but it is definitely worth it!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I would recommend this movie, it was funny and relatable. Great to be viewed with your significant other or girlfriends.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|What a crappy example of the selfish, upper class people of America. No wonder the rest of the world hates us when they see these stupid, vapid characters with the depth of a mud puddle.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Very comfortable, low profile and keeps good time.  Appears to be great quality and keeps good time without winding. I'd definitely suggest it if this is the type of watch you're looking for.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love this game but, there is one thing that could/would make it so much better. I now have thousands of coins with NOTHING to spend them on! You can't exchange them for dozer dollars, prizes, or special rewards. What good is it to have all those coins if yo can't do anything with them?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved all the characters and story line.  Keeps you wanting more.  Wish I could get season three on prime video.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's as good as everybody said it was.  I watched all the episodes in a one-day orgy! Didn't even stop for lunch!
B003B96AOW|1.0|I don't normally review items but the moment I recieved this I was very excited to get him displayed and much to my dismay the character that I thought I was buying NEW (NOTE NEW AMAZON) came in an opened package. I couldnt be more upset... Especially considering there were other vendors selling the same exact thing ALSO MARKED NEW which stated sealed in box. I am looking for a number right now to call and complain and I will start the return process as soon as I can. BE CAREFUL SHOPPERS.... If you want a SEALED toy this is NOT the way to get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching season 1 & 2, I had no choice but to watch season 3!  Another one day orgy of Downton Abbey.  Can't wait for season 4!
B001O53BKG|5.0|Surprisingly funny and at parts touching.  Became a fan of Both Rainn Wilson and Emma Stone from this movie.  Would recommend it to anyone that is a Beatles fan and knows the story about Pete Best.
B000B589JI|4.0|Water tight, works exactly as designed. if you don't need to hold large amounts of fluid, this is the ticket!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I bought this game for my granddaughter, but I think I play it more than her.  It's so much fun chasing down the animals.  You have a strategy to catch some of them.  I have three games like this , but this one is the best one.  I play it daily and sometimes all day .  You can get caught up in it and the time flies by. It's really fun.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I had to know what was coming next.  Glad I got to read it before the movie came out.  Love!
B008133MDK|5.0|This series is riveting.  Like a movie for every episode.  Truly epic storytelling and great twists throughout.  Well acted as well.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this album! Hendrix was, is, & always will be amazing! HUGE extra happy bonus for me is Larry Lee playing rhythm / 2nd guitar on a couple of the cuts. Stephen Stills & Buddy Miles!! It bears repeating that this album sounds great. Much respect for Eddie Kramer &#60;3
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved the characters, author really made you care about them. Reminded me of The Help, which was one off favorites.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show! The plot is great and the characters are so well developed with really intriguing relationships. Very entertaining!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It I is a great free game that tries to Getty you t spend money on it later.  But out is
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|The Sessions had me alternatively laughing and crying. What a great movie! Watch it. You'll be better off for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good. The graphics were amazing and the prizes were great. I even hit the jackpot 3 times!
B00BESCJII|4.0|I love movies that are touching, inspiring and transformative. This was one of those coming of age movies that was all these things and more. Definitely reccomend it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great action book and it was interesting the whole way through till the end.  Read the whole series 4 times now.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|heard alot about the movie, so tried the book first to see if i liked it.  maybe i will see the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing subway surfers as my kids love this game too.  We play it everyday and take turns. Very good game and very much a lot of fun!
B00454U1NS|5.0|Pink is awesome - love her music - she keeps re-inventing herself.<br />A few of her lyrics are a little offensive but have to listen anyway<br />because she is so talented. At her recent Boston concert she skipped the<br />questionable lyrics because she noticed so many young people in the<br />audience.  That's Pink &#34;class&#34;.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|Nice concept and good assortment of characters. Story line way too far out for us. Very similar to 'Lost' in story style.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|A few times I've tried to purchase credits where they charged me, but never gave me credit.  they want everything but the kitchen sink to give you any credit back. With that being said - this is my favorite bingo site. I love the variety!
B0093H8H8I|3.0|Latest version still fails 0-255 black range. New interface stinks. Plan on a separate video card to get good video. Look for one of those silent 20$ after rebate cards
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I love Paul Anka music since a was 10 years old,when I live in Peru.All my classmate and whole school listened his songs Diana,Adan y Eva,Crazy Love ,you are my destiny and so on;All are fabulous.Now in this new CD Paul change  a litlle the original melodies but in a perfect way so is a deligth to our ears and feelings .Thank you Paul for this present  We love you.
B005JABSB6|1.0|Unfortunately, my fault I guess, I didn't try these until after the 30-day return policy. The on-off switch was broken. Cheap; would've probably broken if they had ever worked. Flimsy pieces of you-know-what. Too bad they stopped making quality models that came out at time of TV manufacture.<br /><br />I'd buy a 3-D TV that doesn't require electronic shutters if I had had a choice; my Aquos was to replace defective model that wasn't 3-D. Paid a little extra 'cause I like 3-D.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Juvenile writing for mature readers. Don't really know what all the hype was about. I got about 10 pages in and realized this book was written by a very immature author.  It reads like a young-adult novel, but is definitely not for younger audiences.  Just silly.
B004Z4LYU2|5.0|As a retired PhD air pollution professional, I have considerable background in physical chemistry, fluid dynamics, and the like. This book has opened up the world of modern physics for me. It is a report from and about modern physics from a person who has been there and done that. It is a summary contrasting and comparing approaches such as string theory, QED, quantum gravity, cosmology, and related topics from a scientist who is active in several of these fields, and writes with grace, clarity, and imagination about the strengths and weaknesses of current theoretical approaches. He starts by identifying five major unsolved problems in modern physics, and uses these problems to rate modern theories for efficacy, He points out some novel and thought provoking new experimental data, and suggests where they might lead. He is careful to distinguish background dependent from background independent approaches, and allows for the possibility that general relativity needs to be amended. Without a single mathematical formula, he conveys the basic characteristics of a plethora of theories, and references who developed each one and when. This book has inspired me to pursue more information on several emerging theories, and provided an opening to the literature through which to pursue this information. I fully recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in cosmology or modern physics as an enjoyable and readable way to put those interests in context.
B0086449YA|5.0|This is an excellent CG! Mark Knopfler is the best, most diverse guitarist in the world! I recommend buying it!
B00BF11STU|3.0|As much as I liked the Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty was pretty boring. Even the final assault moved at a glacial pace. Perhaps that was historically accurate (no idea), but if that wasn't, then it helped this snoozer drag its feet 'til the end. Best of luck on your next flick Ms. Bigelow.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I got into it kinda late, slow start, yet, really picked up for me 45 mins into it and I was glad I rented it.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|** Spoiler alert ** While I enjoyed Pi's journey and enjoyed some of the rich visuals, it did not meet it's sole purpose: to help us believe in the existence of God. I feel like other films sold viewers on their more remarkable tales (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Big Fish) and in the end, Life of Pi did not soar as high, or prove its premise, as well as other films before. Still, it would be worth a rent to see Lee's cinematic achievements.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|Great book if you would like to get some ideas on how to market your book. Not really for you if you are a solid Internet Marketer and know about selling on Amazon already.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am a fan of the stage productions of Les Miserables, having seen them many times.  I was curious how the movie might compare to the stage production.  I was not disappointed with the movie.  I found that each type of production has its merits.  The stage production leaves to the viewer's imagination the terrible plight of the French people in the time of the revolution and therefore the viewer is allowed to focus on the major uplifting themes of redemption and forgiveness.  The movie on the other hand shows very graphically the plight of the people and takes on a more historically accurate aire without losing focus on the major themes.  I was particularly moved by Anne Hathaway's performance of the song &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; which was reflective of the tragic times, much unlike the other uplifting performances commonly heard in the media.  All members of the cast performed to the highest level; there were no disappointments.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|Not my kind of movie. I fast-forwarded through most of it thinking it would get better - it didn't. If you're a Transformers fan, you'll like it.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was a good entertaining movie. It was just a good clean movie, but too long for the story line
B008602KQI|1.0|Absolute crap in downloading on TV. The system used by Amazon for streaming is as much fun watching as watching grass grow. Better work on your streaming Amazon.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|After the first thirty minutes I was ready to turn the movie off. Denzel is the greatest but the script was not. I like this type of movie but I was very disappointed.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Stay in touch with professional organizations and updated comments by fellow professionals.<br />Outstanding use of the social media! I use it daily.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Simply stunnin<br />g. There is no other novel quite like it. Thank you, Erin Morgenstern for the mesmerizing enchantment that filled every page!!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is 1 of the first games I purchased on Amazon, when I bought my smartphone.  By far, this is the best rpg game ever. The ease of game play &amp; complexity of rpg elements is well worth the money &amp;  time you'll end up playing. The game developers seem to always hard at work improving &amp; upgrading their games. I was so impressed with this game, that I even bought their other games. Also I would like to mention,  this is my only review I have ever written.  I had the phone for 2 yrs.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I'm completely hooked on this series, although it's possible to overdose. Watch 5 episodes in a row, and you'll start feeling queasy. Ted, the sweet and gentle, holds the show together. I love Marshall and Lily, and for their sake I can tolerate Robin and Barney. May 25, 2013 is the big day. Will we get to see the face of Ted's wife to be?
B007KOLNXC|5.0|What can be said about this series that hasn't already been said. Matt Weiner is a genius. I have seen every episode multiple times and they just get better each time.  This was the first time I ordered video from amazon and was pleased.
B000002MUN|5.0|I bought this cd to replace one that I had lost a few years ago.  One of my favorite Tom Petty cd's!!
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Excellent movie! Very bloody, great plot and a lot of humor all mixed together! Upset I didn't get to see it on big screen!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really, do you need a review? HAHA! It's a Solitaire game...and that's it. It's about as good as any I suppose. I haven't had any issues with it crashing or anything.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django is a good film and it contains a lot of action in the times shortly before the civil war.  Django is a freed slave seeking a way to find and save his wife from a life of slavery and brutality.  He is befriended by a man who has given him hope that accomplishing his goal is possible.<br /><br />This is a typical Quentin Tarantino film with graphic violence and language but it is also filled with action and adventure.  The cinematography is very good in the film and the storyline are interesting.  Saved from slavery by a German dentist (Christoph Waltz) who is now a bounty hunter, Django (Jamie Fox) becomes a master gunman and bounty hunter and so the adventure begins.....<br /><br />The film features an all-star cast and the acting is very good.  It is almost like an old Clint Eastwood type of western story.  I enjoyed the action of the film and the acting.  Jamie Fox did a wonderful job in the lead role.  Christoph Waltz in the role of the German dentist also did a fantastic job and you begin to like him and his personality more and more as the film goes on.  The film does have a lot of graphic violence and language in it and some of the scenes are very bloody.  The film for me was entertaining but perhaps a bit long at 166 minutes.<br /><br />It is a classic western film done in Quentin Tarantino style and if you are one of the fans of his movies then this is a must see film.
B0086700CM|3.0|For some reason this app doesn't play like it did on my iPhone. Why? I couldn't tell you. It might be my Samsung S3, but who knows. Other apps run fine, just this one isn't the same.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a must read, for doubters and believers alike.  Dr. Alexander knew the science of the brain and God used that knowledge to show him just how real God and Heaven are.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this show, wish all the seasons where on here. Good actors and good stories. Love that I don't have to wait each week for any of the series, and no comercials
B005K17RU0|1.0|I liked the old version but when using the new one; ads block the radar, very slow to load, During a recent T-Storm I had to borrow my wife's phone to watch it on radar. She had weather bug and now I do to. Life is good again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love the 3-2-1 method.  Workouts only last 20 minutes, but you actually feel like you did something in those 20 minutes.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Witty, well written, whimsical.  Great cast with great chemistry.  I am going to be extremely sad when all of the previous episodes are finished.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|overall a good episode moving on with new doctor ...story line a bit weak.  but still watch the next one
B00AWFEBDK|3.0|The first 2/3 where JD reviews the different ways in which people interact in traditional cultures is interesting to learn about.  It provides thought provoking insights that inspire one to consider what good to keep from more traditional cultures.  I now understand the many ways in which WEIRD societies are both better and worse than traditional societies.<br /><br />I knock a full 2 stars off because his diet advice in the last few sections is pure conventional wisdom (no salt, eat healthy whole grains, avoid fatty meats) rather than well researched and based on evolutionary principles.  Jared Diamond is a good anthropologist, but a bad nutritionist.  He should have had a better adviser on this section of the book, and I would have expected someone so well versed in tradtional eating practices to look to someone in the Paleo nutrition world for some advice.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It's pretty common knowledge that when it comes to thermal paste and PS3 reflow work, AS5 is a great way to go. As long as you apply the proper amount (not too much, not even as thick as ceramic thermal paste or what comes in the PS3 to begin with) it will serve you well.<br /><br />Great product.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The last in this Pendergast trilogy. Way too much physically impossible heroic feats of strength and perfection in the first few chapters, even for Pendergast, but settled down to typically good Preston & Child. I still like the Nazis as deeply hiddle criminals.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Fits perfectly, sticks to charger (not prone to falling off). If it's not on the charger however, it can be very easy to lose
B007THA4FI|2.0|Couldn't get past the first few boring chapters. My wife will have a go at it next and tell me if I didn't give it a fair chance.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Don't see much of Issac Hayes anymore an ol' one eye does a pretty decent job, pre Stallone stupiidity and unbelievable antics
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best app ever. It is so much fun! My character is Kim the Sydney special. I love playing it when I get home from school.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|This movie is so inspiring to people who want to become big in life if l your poor. So I love this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am addicted to Downton Abbey.  It drew me in from the very first episode and I get to watch it all by myself on my Kindle Fire.  :)
B004V2S4SS|4.0|Wish this was still on! Medium was one of my can't miss shows - so I am bummed that it was cancelled but at least I can watch all the seasons on dvd!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but I hate endings that aren't endings! Mr. Landay had my attention throughout the novel and then it was like he got bored writing and decided to end the book. There were no loose ends tied up and in fact they were just dangling in the wind. Or he did it on purpose. Either way, I couldn't recommend this book.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, now Skyfall. I still prefer Casino Royale, but Skyfall is a close 2nd. Too bad that &#34;M&#34; had a bad day, and the new &#34;Q&#34; looks like Steve Jobs in the early 80's. Well worth watching several times!
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This movie was just ok... Not as funny as I thought it would be. I did find it to be relateable in parts though.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Although not totally accurate about a secret Jimmy Carter approved rescue, it does capture your attention and makes you think. Again, worth watching no matter the movie awards status.
B005LAIH54|5.0|Way better than I expected.  This was a great movie, and though it had special effects, those did not overwhelm the movie, whereas clash of the titans was too much CG in one film.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Good story line (can't say great). What sets this movie apart from many others is the fantastic use of ALL video and computer graphic arts available. I watched it over 3 times!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Totally love this game and I'm getting better everytime!!  No regrets in downloading it!!!  If you have or haven't played this game it doesn't matter this is still awesome!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Interesting story line containing historical facts, violence, and comedy. Quentin loves to make appearances in his movies. In this one, he really dug a hole for himself!
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|Do not buy this album!!  He has stolen many of the tracks he claimed to create for this album!  He has publicly stated that he used one of the most questioned songs without permission from the artists who actually created the music!  DO NOT SUPPORT THIEVES!  He is lucky the requirement for rating is at least 1 start or else I would give this 0.  He deserves no credit.
B004NELBPC|1.0|The fonts for this app are too small and the settings can only be changed when you are at the very first page of the app.<br /><br />For some strange reason the developers decided to use giant pictures and short tag lines for stories sections. this can often force a use to read a sorry before getting a full understanding of its content. Huffington post is notorious for using misleading stock photos on their website, and the cutting of words from the story summaries in the current app only make things worse.<br /><br />Take a pass on this app and just use the web.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Not a huge fan of director Ang Lee. If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger then you will certainly enjoy more tiger.  Irrfan Kahn was the most realistic character in the film, which leads me to believe that the film would have been better, from the required CGI to build it, as an animation.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|This is pretty low budget. Because the intro is fancy, I didn't realize it when it was on television. But when you watch a few episodes in a row you realize pretty quickly that there are only about five characters in the whole show, the female lead always shows up at dangerous scenes alone because they can't afford a partner agent for her, and the acting -- aside from Walter -- is absolutely horrible. The guy from Dawson's Creek is just terrible. He is hot, but he can't act in season one. I hope it gets better. Still, I like fringe/sci-fi crap, so I keep watching.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is lots of fun. Didn't take forever to figure out and the graphics are amazingly real. I look forward to more versions.
B008602KQI|2.0|This movie has the heart and soul of the Tin Man. It is all action and no character development. It is all sexiness and no passion. It is just bad. Even the action scenes aren't that exciting. It can only get better with the second movie... I hope.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I love Buble's voice.  However, when I buy a book, see a movie, or listen to music there is only one thing I ask for - that it moves my heart and emotions.  This album was not my favorite.  It's a mixture of oldies, upbeat, and Doo Wop rolled into one.  Frankly, I only liked the following songs:  You Make Me Feel So Young, Close Your Eyes, To Be Loved, Nevertheless, Young at Heart.  I just wasn't impressed or moved by the others.  Buble should stick to what he does best - croon to the ladies the oldies but goodies that are timeless in quality and filled with heart and emotion.  That is his gift, and when he strays from the best that he does, the other songs become mediocre and not memorable.  He's made a niche for himself that has given him fame, and I guess many of his listeners wish he'd just give us more and more of what makes him Michael Buble.<br /><br />Oh, and as far as Reese Witherspoon singing with him on \\"Something Stupid\\" it definitely turned out to be just that - stupid.  She couldn't stay in sync with his voice and when she did, you could barely hear the monotone droll. Why, oh why, was that recorded?<br /><br />For me, I'll pull out his former albums and pick the ones I love to hear him sing.  If you don't want to buy the whole thing, I suggest you listen to the previews and download the few you like instead.
B004CURZFC|3.0|Did not hold the interest of younger children the movie was okay.  I wouldn't purchase the movie,  a little creepy considering the sibling went bad.
B0094K20FK|5.0|If you don't know how great this movie is then nothing I can write will convince you.  On the quality front though, I think this edition really excels.  Details really pop especially in the opening sequence on the Enterprise's main monitor for the Kobiashi Maru scene.  The colors of the Mutara Nebula are much more magical too and there was some good clean up was done of the Genesis cave.  It still looks like a glorified matte painting but now it has a depth of field that it never had before.  Of course because the entire movie was shot with models and not CGI the clarity brings that out - seeing Reliant and Regula 1 side by side is comical - but it also creates a sense of reality that no CGI has yet to replicate.
B0052BZ6X8|2.0|A rather disjointed and disconnected story line - many gaps that could only be understood if the book had also been read.
B008HK3XYK|1.0|If i want to use the camera or the video app and use the case stand the device has to go into the case a certain way but I want to charge the device while the lid is close i have to turn the device around in the case, But then the camera is upside down. why the designers didn't include access to the ports through the binding makes no sense to me.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I noticed a lot of his music lately has overwhelming blaring background horns that I find more irritating. He has a great voice, but I felt the CD poorly produced and the horns just destroys the quality of his voice. Too much background singing too.  At times the background fluff completely drowns his voice. He tries to emulate Frank Sinatra and that's also a big mistake.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|My only wish is that there was more customer support for the App. otherwise i Love it. I don't always have access to wifi so this app give me access to my Google calender off line.
B002MY9NF0|4.0|I'd love to see a remake using today's technology. The special effects here were a little hokey. Ok, a lot hokey.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Weak script, weak acting, weak everthing.  I could not hold my attention so I shut it off.  I suggest you dont even start watching it....and I'm in my 40's.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The writing, plot and characters give an insight into a world, the harshness of which is unbelievable. I highly recommend it.
B000VH4OCW|5.0|The one I would want if stranded on a desert island.  The answers to life are in the key of life.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|its a great kit. The Ifixit website is a great helper when you are doing repairs. I just wish the kit came with at least 1 splooger and a mini suction cup.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|my daughter and her family really like it.  They don't have cable or dish so the series are really great for them.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It worked to put between the fan and the motherboard of my computer.  Now my computer is working great. Thanks
B004YM6JI2|5.0|the family loves the series and this is the only way they can see it.  They watch them over and over.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Just the old Pacman from the eighties and atari.  I have enjoyed playing the game during breaks and down time.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I wanted to see this and missed it at a theater.  One couple who were rescued live in Washington state and were interviewed regarding the incident.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like this game I just wish there were more lives.....y can't there b free lives...they need more games like these...
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I like the stunts.  Pretty standard bond movie, nothing special though.<br /><br />Daniel Craig was great, got little bit boring in the second part of the movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a must read for all ages. I suggest that everyone reads this. Ok once you start reading this series you can't put it down. The romance, the danger, the real aspects of our world is put into this book.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|I enjoy period pieces anyway, but this series is fun.  Jeremy Irons is a terrific actor, but there is great support from the rest of the cast.  Nice cliff hanger and we get a chance to see Alexander Borgia as a father.
0553565915|5.0|I received this book when are son had died.  It really helped us deal with his loss.  We have since bought a number of additional books and given them to friends who had family members pass away.
0714864803|4.0|I bought this book after 6 weeks in Lebanon so I could cook some of the food I had there when I was home. It's an incredibly detailed book with tons of recipes covering a wide spectrum of food and culture. All of the recipes I've tried far have been excellent, authentic and aren't complicated. I highly recommend it for both yourself and friends.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm new to the world of Kindle Fires,  but I know that Angry Birds is awesome!!! YEARS of fun trying to complete
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have been a fan of Big Fish for years now on my pc.  I thought I would give them a try on my Kindle Fire.  They have not let me down.  Keep your games coming.  I love them!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! It gives you lots of chances to test your creativity. Also,  for $2.99, you can get the best Sandbox level ever: Field of DREAMS!!! It lives up to the name!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is an amazing movie! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good adventure movie! It transports you to Middle Earth.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have not enjoyed a thriller this much since Girl Gone. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Little Mermaid?  Mulan?  Beauty & Beast? Tangled?... meh!  Lilo and Stich... Awesome!  (Treasure Planet... Awesome!)  A good sci-fy flick.  Touching.  Funny.  Rough around the edges... like Stitch.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|First off I didn't know it was a romance novel. Second it was way too long. Third the punctuation left a lot to be desired.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|great comedy..... I couldn't stop laughing :) Mark Wahlberg is amazing! I appreciate and love sarcasm... this movie was the spot on description of sarcasm
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I have been waiting for Dido to come out with a new album for a long time and it was well worth the wait.<br />I got the album on the day it was released to the public and amazon came through with their promise.
B003K15INU|5.0|The story of the Swede is an outstanding, outstanding read.<br /><br />I really, truly enjoyed the way in which Roth creates a world of ambiguity and circumstance... of best intentions gone awry, and how good people in small worlds may still be shown to be painfully ignorant. I've recommended this to many friends, and will likely read again.
0062059963|5.0|I was riveted from beginning to end. This is a great book.<br /><br />On three separate occasions, I was tempted to throw the book across the room. That's how engrossed I was in the characters and how powerfully they made me feel about them. I can list a handful of other books that have given me the same reaction.<br /><br />There were a few twists I didn't expect and the emotional roller coaster was surprising. Very well crafted and so worth the wait. I look forward to The One and will have a hard time waiting a whole year. Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful! A must read for anyone who wants to read a good book. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Now I realize some folks won't like the &#34;happy slaves&#34; moments, and I had to pause a few times and think about that, too. But this is, even with the happily ever after sort of story threaded through it, so interesting that I couldn't put it down. Our book club talked a lot about this book. It's definitely worth checking out.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have been playing this game for about a week now. This game is great way to pass time while trying to relax.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|This was my wife's favorite movie, and I totally expected a pseudo-chick-flick when I sat in front of the TV...but boy was I wrong.
B000ID1J0E|1.0|Not funny.  Couldn't sit through this, wish I could have my $1.99 and 90 minutes back.  If you read at a 4th grade level or higher, you will likely not enjoy this film.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I have never seen this program until watching it on Amazon. It just never appealed to me from the commercials. I was so wrong. Very good story!
B005PK57IK|5.0|The show deals with real life events and situations.  I admire the way that family quagmires are dealt with.  I would recommend this show to family and friends.
B000O14VAU|5.0|Love this series....Watch them in order for maximum enjoyment:D I have re watched these vampire/ lycan ones a few times:D

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It's fun and creative,also so unique.All my friends play ,I like the tour so far, this app should get a award.
0307887898|4.0|I have to admint that while I was reading this, I kept having to tamp down the bias that this book is written for software centric ventures.  Yes, the examples are clearly anchored in technology/application development.  Be smart enough to look past that and grasp the concepts and you have a good tool that can be leveraged in just about any sector and just about any function.<br /><br />I actually prefer that the book doesn't get into trying to tell the reader how to specifically apply techniques all across the board.  In other words, you have to take the knowledge and filter it through your own critical thinking to adapt it to your own purposes.  To me, that is the mark of a true best practice.  Valuable concept, concrete definitions - and the ability to adapt it to a broad audience.
B00027JYLC|5.0|\\"Freaks\\" is often listed as a horror film, but I don't think it really fits that genre. Actually, I'm not sure if it fits into any established genre. It's a unique film, one of the most bizarre yet spellbinding movies ever made. Almost all of the \\"freaks\\" were real, with no makeup or special effects used. One of them, the half-woman/half-man, was probably just a female impersonator and not a hermaphrodite, but the rest were shockingly real.<br /><br />After seeing the film, I found articles about most of the performers on Wikipedia. It was fascinating to read about the actors' lives. Daisy and Violet Hilton, the Siamese Twins, were for real, being born as twins joined at the pelvis. Frieda and Hans were actually sister and brother, played by Daisy and Harry Earles. The Human Skeleton was played by Peter Robinson, who was of average height but weighed less than 60 pounds. (Ironically, he married a circus fat lady who weighed 467 pounds.)<br /><br />As shocking as the film is, consider that the first audiences in 1932 found the film to be so disturbing that almost one-third of the film's length was eventually cut, and the ending changed, to make it more palatable to viewers. Even with that, the film was banned in the UK for thirty years. Unfortunately, the film of the original ending has been lost.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented on the video and audio quality of the DVD. I think you have to consider that Freaks was made in 1932, in an era when \\"talkies\\" had only been made for about three years, and both film and audio recording technology was still fairly primitive.<br /><br />Check out the Freaks listing on IMDB for some bloopers that were pretty easy to spot.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Wow...so bad! We were very disappointed in this movie. I think these two are usually really good together but this time they came off as a really unhappy couple. Who needs to watch that! Not funny at all.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is my first attempt at a hidden objects game on the Kindle. I feel that the scenes are on the small side and enlarging the scene doesn't always work.
B00BKBCF38|3.0|Whoever mastered this album and brickwalled it should be put up against a brick wall and shot. It's extremely clipped all over the place. I am very disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I thought this was a game like Angry Birds that you could play independently on your phone.  I'm glad it was a free version.  I don't know that I will play it much.
B003NVMWBS|5.0|This is a movie that I have watched everytime I see it in TV and decided that it would be perfect for my kindle.  If you like Susan  Sarandon and or Julia Roberts you will enjoy this movie.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Huge fan of shows like Dexter, 24, etc. and this equaled the intensity. Couldn't wait for each episode to come out. Highly recommend!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like the fast pace but wish for more time or different playing options. Enjoy the tourney option too. good overall
B00BF123WG|4.0|I thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic.  Overall seemed very realistic and not overly Hollywoodized, which I really appreciated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Who can go wrong with the Bible? I love it and so does my Hubster! Reading the word in my kindle is heaven to a church going girl like me!
B003L77GH4|5.0|This season is definitely the best IMHO, as my twin said, \\"It has a great story arc.\\" What an amazing story arc! *Spoiler Alert* We finally get to meet Katherine, who keeps impersonating Elena (which annoys her to no end). Elena becomes more like Katherine as her pattern of using Damon (throughout the series really) continues, yet she hates Damon for understandable reasons. To me the two women are the heart of the series. Much of what we learn about the two is important in understanding them and the Salvatore brothers, and actress Nina Dobrev is excellent in her portrayal of Elena and Katherine.<br />As everyones hands get dirty, I find myself drawn to Damon, Caroline and Alaric. They seem to have a real consistency with their personalities. They've errored, they apologize (sometimes) and then they seem to move on without dwelling in misery. Damon is our Loki, Caroline a fallen princess, and Alaric the doomed lover.<br />There are no good guys or bad guys, everyone on the show has an agenda and they're sticking to it. I absolutely adore this series, it is boyond addictive and love all the characters. With each episode it only gets better.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|My husband is a Linkedin guru so that was the greated download for him...well aside from the Bible. He is pleased, therefore so is wifey!
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This movie was jsut kinda ehhhhh.  It was funny at times but extremely long.  Not a comedy as it was billed, but more of a dramedy.
B008HLZUUE|4.0|I got to learn about more of the characters that I didn't really know,but others there was not mention of. I understand that it is actually part of a whole which the next book addresses. I can't wait to read it.
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|For me, this is the most personally touching portrayal of the life of Christ on film. I can't believe anyone could sit through it and not be moved in some way. Whether you're a believer or not, I highly recommend. Jim Caviezel is superb, what an amazing job he did as Jesus. Wonderful, wonderful film! I make sure I have lots of tissue at my side when I watch because I cry like a baby every time, it's that good.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Would like another of this authors books. Well written in a light style, with good understanding of a difficult subject.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|It was that good, still haven't gotten sick of watching it. Can't wait for the sequels! Action packed, non-stop excitement. Acting/casting was tight as drum, direction and editing were spot-on. Excellent!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the first FPS I have download on my kindle because it's the only one I have seen that actually looked decent.  Trust me, the controls are a little funny at first but once you get it your good.  This game is awesome.
B000FC1GJW|4.0|Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is such an ambitious undertaking that I wondered if he'd be able to pull it off. The answer is: sort of. The quest is momentous, the stakes high. The premise and themes are as lofty as you can get--the very purpose of human existence.<br />If I were to compare this trilogy to The Lord of the Rings, I'd say the story is more nuanced than the good and evil of LOTR, the plot less linear. And while no world building can match Tolkien's, the worlds that Pullman's creates are amazing: Citegazze with its specters and the inventors of the subtle knife; the world with the Mulafa, who learned to travel on wheels, developed in a symbiotic relationship with trees; Lyra's own world, so similar to ours but so different; the world of the dead; and our own world juxtaposed with all of these.<br />The writing is good and seemed to improve with each book. And yet despite all of this, it failed to rise to the level the premise deserved. Why? Emotion comes not just from plot but from how the characters react to it. And in this regard, the author failed to let us deep enough inside the characters to fully experience what the situation deserved.<br />The premise should feel more cataclysmic than LOTR, not merely the triumph of good over evil, but a more multi-layered conflict between seekers of knowledge and those who would deny the human race growth. So why doesn't it feel more powerful? The answer lies in how close we get to know Frodo and Sam, the intensity of their relationship, and the depth of the secondary characters.<br />Mr. Pullman doesn't let us that close to his characters, perhaps due to his choice of omniscient perspective. But I can't help thinking what this series might have been.<br />The author's diatribe against the church is mild and not pro or con religion, but for or against open-mindedness and the quest for knowledge. There are believers and agnostics that come down on both side of these issues.<br />This trilogy was broad, original, well-written, dramatic and with lofty themes. But stories are told through their characters. And whether it be Lord Asriel or Mrs. Coulter, Lyra or Will, I never felt deeply about them. This is a great series that rises well above most of what we see today in fiction. With a bit more it could have risen to the level of a true classic.road, original, well-written, dramatic and with lofty themes. But stories are told through their characters.

B00006AFF5|5.0|While I do not love this movie as much as the old animated classic, I still find it very enjoyable. There are a couple jokes that I think they could have done without, but overall everyone I know loves this movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come out!!!! It's amazing and is combined with regular scribblenauts and super scribblenauts!! I do recommend this app to anyone!! 5 stars definitely!!! :)

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Was very cautious due to the hype surrounding this movie. Bcoop and Jlaw are amazing and perfect! Hands down best movie of 2012 and I enjoyed Argo and Django to the max!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This is one Canon product that I didn't mind paying the &#34;Canon Brand&#34; price for. After spending $1,200 on my Canon 7D with its magnesium body I could not comprehend putting a $30 plastic aftermarket battery grip on it. This allows me to shoot for several days with dual batteries and not have to worry about missing a shot because of a dead battery. The fit and finish is exactly like the 7D body. I highly recommend this battery grip.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|It's nice every now and then to be able to watch a movie for family movie night that isn't a cartoon but still mostly appropriate for my eight year old.
0399160450|5.0|Talk about right on today's news.  The WSJ continues to write about this subject and Clancy's scenario fits the news cycle like a glove.  It is a great book and detailed enough to give a non-techie a good feel for the havoc cyber hacking can brng to our total military and business systems.  Lots of pages but they just fly by!

B0089GQB28|2.0|We made the mistake of watching the 'extended' version - which (at 3 hours) is about an hour wasted.<br /><br />The first half is fairly well done - but the movie turns into something of a 'shaggy dog' story - with simply too much irrelevant drama.<br /><br />Pass it by.  There are better choices available.<br /><br />And:  Why two versions?  There should be one 'good' version, and that's it.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I'M WAITING FOR THE NEXT SEASON.. HURRY WITH IT ALREADY!!!! I CAN NO LONGER WAIT... I'M PULLING MY HAIR OUT!!!!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Among the top 2 or 3 movies we've watched in the past couple of years.  Well done and very enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended!
0307591549|5.0|The author has a great converstational tone and humor that makes it easy to read. I like all the examples of how to make changes in thinking patterns. I just tried one right before a presentation and I was much less nervous! I haven't finished the book but I have enjoyed what I have read so far. Defiantly worth reading.
B002BWP49C|5.0|i loved it when edward told bella he hadnt told her everything about him and she siad what, you are not a virgin. i loved his shy smile. and on their honeymoon how bell tried to seduce him with her black teddy and he laughed. loved it.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|loved it as usual. i have been team edward since the beginning. i cried when edward proposed to bella. it was so beautiful.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Just now starting to watch and we're completely hooked. Reminds me a little of the Shield but more modern, definitely worth a watch.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Personally love it but also tried with special needs kid I work with and he the wind app helped him a tough time.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Fun mindless entertaining movie. If you were a teenager in the 80's, this has to be one of your favorites. I found it grew old quote well, still fun to watch after all these years.
0385536828|3.0|Read this for a book club - we really liked Atonement and Saturday better - it was ok - we will continue to read his future books - always good for lively discussions

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't drawn to this movie from the previews when it was in theatrical release, but we decided to give it a shot on movie night at home since Disney animation films are still usually at least entertaining if they fall short from Pixar expectations. I still didn't expect much until about half way into the film as the character personalities really began to show and then it really started getting engaging. Disney managed to command tears from me on this one with a couple of very key touching moments that I won't spoil for you here.<br /><br />Another cool note was that this wasn't just a cheezy animated film using video games as a gimmick to draw an audience. Granted, I'm sure that still worked out that way, but one of my favorite parts of this film is that Disney did a good job with getting authentic video game character cameos and they weren't just some generic clone of popular characters/games. Again, I'll spare you the spoilers on what characters/games you'll see mentioned but keep your eyes open, the references are everywhere in Game Central Station!<br /><br />If you like films that make you all warm and fuzzy, you won't be disappointed!
B00B0HXC4I|4.0|This is a great album but the big problem that I see when reading reviews of this and their sophomore album is that they are treated like &#34;rock albums.&#34; I think they should be treated more like parodies but not in a funny way. For those of you who remember the &#34;Chant&#34; and &#34;Chant II&#34; craze that is kinda how I see these like mock gregorian chant albums but they have payed a mock catholic church for Satan. Both of these albums are great and I would recommend them but not if you're going for the traditional bang your head death metal.
B0007OZ16C|4.0|My toddler niece loves Schleich animals and I like bison so I bought this for her.  There isn't much to say about it.  If you've owned/seen other Schleich animals, it's of the same quality you expect from them.  This guy is a bit bigger than some of the other animals which makes sense.<br /><br />Solid Schleich.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Tom Hardy is pretty mean in this one, Shia did a really good job too.  I recommend this movie, good story, based on a true story too.
0062059963|3.0|Spoilers!<br /><br />First off. As I clarified in a tweet to Kiera Cass a few months ago, this series is primarily romance. It isn't supposed to be a dystopian with romance on the side. And so with this knowledge I will review it from that point of view<br /><br />This whole book was basically about the development of America's choice to try for Maxon over Aspen. Seriously that is pretty much the only difference between the beginning and the ending. The choices she made in the story are clear and each scene has a purpose of causing her to grow in her confidence and decide how to move forward<br /><br />Unfortunately her beating around the bush and waiting and constantly lacking in her ability to confirm her feelings about Maxon come with consequences, which I absolutely adore. I'm glad that in the end Maxon is hesitant and has another girl lined up. He isn't an idiot. In fact I'm kind of shocked as to why he even wants America around anymore, she really made terrible choices. However the book ends with a clear intent to fight for Maxon now, which will definitely be interesting to see pan out, however it will be a long time until the last book comes out<br /><br />The story was definitely not worth the eighteen dollars I paid for it. It has the storyline more like that of the five dollar paperback kind of romance novel. Luckily it is a Young Adult book which allows for it's hardback kind of hype<br /><br />I think it's quite unfortunate that the author didn't hit more on the dystopian part of the world, as it has so much potential. It could have been a massive story and definitely would have warranted the price more. There is so much intrigue with it. Are the North and South working together? What do her father and brother have to do with the rebellion? Is Maxon or Aspen or both involved in the rebellion? It just really could have added so many extra layers to the story<br /><br />The details just basically lead you to believe that more will happen, but really it isonly the romance that gets developed. Not saying it is a bad thing for a romance novel, but there could have been more.<br /><br />It really could have been one long book and been just fine. Imagine Twilight, but even more romance focused and less exploring of the Volturi politics. Yeah.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|I watched this a lot when I was a kid, I just watched it with my kids and they loved it, thanks for having it available to stream.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|If you can get past another case of Hollywood congratulating itself for its so-called crucial role in this story, the rest of the story was very good.
B0095P31L6|5.0|My two year old loves this movie. She has seen it several times.  It's nice to have something newer available to stream.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|I love Jane Austin and this film is true to the novel, which was one of her less noteworthy.  It is worth a view if you are a Jane Austin fan.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|This movie was definitely ahead of it's time and by today's standards is still a masterpiece in the technology dept.
B00B97SNJI|3.0|I have to admit:  I'm completely underwhelmed by this album.  Given that Dawes is one of my all-time favorite acts after releasing only two albums, I really had high expectations for this third effort.  And I've been disappointed.  After owning the album for two weeks I've listened to it perhaps 5-6 times in total.  After two weeks, I had been listening to each of North Hills and Nothing is Wrong at least twice a day.  I'm sure the new album will grow on me a bit as I continue to listen, but I have no doubt that it will never captivate me.<br /><br />I think the album is too mature.  Strange, given that 3 of the guys in the band must be 25 and younger.  The maturity factor has always worked in their favor:  Taylor writes songs well beyond his years, and this is a very impressive talent.  But it's as if they've morphed into Christopher Cross.  They took the worst of the last album (\\"Moon on the Water\\") and decided to make that easy listening number the foundation of their new direction.  There is nothing immediate or particularly memorable on this album (except, perhaps, for the single, which I quite like).<br /><br />I've read articles about how the band wanted to make an album that was \\"modern\\" and \\"of the moment\\", and wanted a producer that would help get them there.  I think they failed.  I don't see how this album is \\"modern\\" by anyone's definition.  If anything, it is decidedly less \\"modern\\" than the prior album.  There is no edge.  The vocals are too perfect -- rounded in shape and softened in texture.  The guitars have a Hootie-like non-offensive sheen. The bass doesn't bounce around.  They might as well have replaced Griffin with a metronome.  There's no flavor.  All of the songs are the same tempo.  There's no vibrancy.  Nothing kicks into high gear.  There aren't any really good Dawesy 80s-style solos.  What the f?<br /><br />Taylor is obviously a prolific lyric writer.  His stories tend to be amusing and interesting, and the lyrics and vocals have alwaysbeen more prominent in Dawes' songs than in that of most other bands.  But I think they went way too far.  The music here, sad to say, is a mere backdrop for the stories.<br /><br />I gave this album 3 out of 5 stars with a heavy heart (sorry for the melodrama), but really, I'm not sure if that's an accurate reflection on my feeling about this album.  It's better than 99% of the crap being released today, but it falls well short of what I had hoped for and come to expect.  For those who are not familiar with Dawes, I strongly suggest you start with one of their first two albums (go with North Hills if you want something for a peaceful ride in the mountains on a clear sunny day, and go with Nothing is Wrong if you want something for a smooth ride down the coast).<br /><br />I still love this band and will continue to eagerly await their live shows and future releases.  This was just a disappointment to me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is very Sim City Esque... I have become really addicted to it.  I've been playing it for a  few hours now, I think a reset button would be a grand edition.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This would have been one of the last books I would have chosen for myself.  I'm a 63 year old woman and I'm neither a fan of history, nor WWII, BUT since it was recommended so highly by a friend I bought it anyway, thinking that I'd never get past the first chapter.  What a surprise!  This is one of the best books I have read in quite a long time.  It gave me a whole new perspective on what it was like for those men of the war, the Americans as well as the Germans.  It was a story of integrity, honor and character.  A true story, not to be forgotten.  I would recommend this book for all ages and both sexes.  I very good read.
